### "no privacy and very limited space"
Not Verified |  Travelled with Air New Zealand on Boeing 787-9 Auckland to Honolulu in business class. The ground handling was some of the best I have experienced. Regrettably the experience quickly became more than a little disappointing. The layout in herringbone pattern resulted in providing no privacy and very limited space. Given that the herringbone style was already discredited by the time ANZ introduced this pattern it is hard to understand why they went with that option. The appalling layout was only exceeded by the extremely poor onboard service with poor menu choice and failure to provide the supper and breakfast requested. It gave the impression that the attendants didn't know what they were doing or were not interested. As a long term user of ANZ and having found their service/product very competitive this latest experience has left me looking to other airlines for long haul flights - what a shame !

### "I would not recommend them"
I booked Air New Zealand after reading positive reviews online, but my experience was completely the opposite. I would not recommend them, especially for anyone traveling with family and an infant. During the check-in process, it took the agent almost an hour to issue our boarding passes due to a technical issue. This left my wife standing with our 4-month-old baby and me with five pieces of luggage, stuck in the same spot. What was most disappointing is that no Air New Zealand staff showed the courtesy to suggest that my wife sit somewhere more comfortable with our newborn. After some time, I had to request assistance myself, and only then were they allowed to sit. Meanwhile, I stood waiting for an hour for tickets I had already purchased online. Boarding the plane was no better. There was no separate line or prioritization for families with infants or elderly passengers, something I’ve consistently seen handled much better by airlines like Air Canada. Based on this experience, I don’t think I’ll be flying with Air New Zealand again.

### "crew infantalize passengers"
Cabin crew infantalize passengers. After a cabin crew correctly informed us on what to do during an emergency, as we sat in the emergency exit seats, we then proceeded to the safety video. I made comment about the video to my wife about the video. Shortly afterwards, a young cabin crew told me where to put my attention. Shocked I exclaimed I was not a 3 year old. She then asked if I would like to change seats. After the flight the manager refused to give me her name nor the name of the infantalizing cabin crew. Turns out the crew ran to the manager complaining I was being a troublesome passenger and swearing, that was a lie, I didn't swear at her, just in deep shock this 20 something year old had the nerve to tell me what to do with my attention. Shocked at the manager covering for this incompetence I requested the pilot for his name, he too refused to give his name and just requested I step outside of the flight with him. Deeply unprofessional behaviour. Flight number NZ 584, 06:25am Christchurch to Auckland.

### "A decent enough job"
A decent enough job on a very full flight. They got me there from A to B without frills or fuss. I liked the onboard Kiwi Qui that they ran during the flight: a nice and quirky touch.

### "quick and easy flight"
Not Verified |  This quick and easy flight was made so enjoyable by the inflight quiz that Air New Zealand have on their short-haul flights. Nice inflight snacks and great crew.

### “ground service was frankly rubbish”
Not Verified |  The ground service was frankly rubbish. We were late because the PA system was broken. The inflight entertainment was so small that EasyJet would have more inflight entertainment than this. No inflight snacks. Not happy.

### “Good flight, nice crew”
Not Verified | This long-haul Air New Zealand flight was so much better than previous Air New Zealand flights. I was in Economy stretch with a lot of legroom. If you want to go Economy stretch I think you should. Ground staff were really nice, cabin crew were nice and it was a quick flight time. I think Air New Zealand should have a Quiz channel because on their short-haul flights, they have a Quiz so I think on the entertainment screen they should have a channel just for Quizzes. Overall, Good flight, nice crew and soft seat for Economy Stretch. Good legroom.

### "They can't find the payment"
I made a $6,350 payment to Air New Zealand. They can't find the payment. It has been 5 days and they still haven't given me any information. I have now had to pay my bank a fee to cary out an investigation into the "missing" funds which could take weeks.

### “crew service was brilliant”
Not Verified | Air New Zealand short haul is brilliant. The crew service was brilliant. There was also a quiz on the plane for the whole flight. Very quick flight time after the plane was late coming in from the previous destination. Brilliant quick flight

### "lack of care for their customers"
We were due to take flight NZ 902 to Papeete arriving at 01.35 on 8 April 2024. 30 minutes into flight, our aircraft returned to Auckland due to hydraulic issues. The flight was rescheduled for 24 hours later arriving Papeete 02.35 on 9 April. Our cruise ship had sailed the previous evening at 18.00. The service & care shown from Air New Zealand was appalling. The ground crew could not care a less. We were told to walk with our cases 2km from the airport to pick up a bus service to transfer us to a designated hotel without any assistance from ANZ staff. Our flight service from Perth was carried out by Wamos Airlines operated by a Spanish crew. The safety instructions were inaudible, & contravene the CAA regulations. We gathered on our return that ANZ were grappling with worldwide maintenance checks on their engines. ANZ General Manager called the arrangements with Wamos was a proactive, temporary measure to avoid major flight cancellations, although the problems were not just confined to the Perth Auckland route Our flight to Papeete, Air New Zealand were aware of the issue before departure because a technician was aboard working in the cockpit. Air New Zealand were not interested in redressing any additional costs which we incurred in trying to meet our ship in the next port This is the first & last time we will travel with this carrier. Air New Zealand are unprofessional & show a total lack of care for their customers. In our opinion they are an extremely poor Company. Our rating for this airline is 0/10, as is value for money & ground crew If you travel with this airline you have been warned.

### "Business Class seats were appalling"
We always try to fly on Singapore Airlines as they are our favourite airline. We travelled to Germany via Singapore on August 15 and returned on September 5 arriving in Auckland on September 7. Both legs to Frankfurt from Auckland and the return leg from Frankfurt to Singapore were on Singapore Airlines in Business Class. Totally superb with large seats, great beds, personal privacy and plenty of floor storage of carry on luggage under the seat in front. Great service. Just perfect. Our last leg was a code share with Air NZ. While the staff were great the Business Class seats were appalling. Cramped, no storage space on the floor, little privacy as the layout pointed you directly towards the passenger across the aisle. There was a large bulkhead next to the seat that intruded on the space.The bed was difficult to set up and put back and very cramped. The tiny foot rest was partially in the aisle and people moving past had to be careful not to trip over it. We had never flown Air NZ Business Class before and have no desire to do it again. It is more like a glorified Economy Class seat with a bit of extra room. Business Class travel is not cheap. Until the airline does a serious upgrade (which we understand they are starting) we would rather wait a few hours extra in Singapore to do all our travel legs on Singapore Airlines.

### "Service was so good"
Not Verified |  Such a lovely experience! Service was so good and food was delicious! The cabin crew were so nice and lovely. Would definitely fly with this airline again.

### “a highly disappointing experience”
Not Verified | I recently had a highly disappointing experience with Air New Zealand, and I feel compelled to share it to help future travelers make informed decisions. My ordeal began with an extended delay at the airport that quickly turned into an overnight stay, largely due to the airline's lack of communication and support. Initially, our flight was delayed, and after waiting for about four hours, it was eventually canceled. Throughout this period, there was minimal information provided about the situation, leaving passengers confused and frustrated. To add to the inconvenience, the airline offered no immediate assistance in rebooking our flight, which only compounded the stress of the situation. While Air New Zealand did provide hotel and meal vouchers, the experience with these compensations was far from satisfactory. The hotel we were directed to did not accept the vouchers due to delays in payment processing by the airline. This left us scrambling for alternative accommodations and additional expenses. The next leg of our journey was similarly marred by issues. The second flight was delayed again, this time due to a broken plane. The airline had to find a new aircraft and transfer catering, further prolonging our travel experience and adding to the frustration. One of the most frustrating aspects of this ordeal has been the difficulty in resolving the financial implications of the delays. Efforts to seek reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses on hotels and meals were met with a series of excuses, slow responses, and an overall lack of effective communication. Reaching a customer service representative was challenging, and when contact was made, responses were often unhelpful and evasive. Overall, my experience with Air New Zealand was far from satisfactory. The combination of poor communication, inadequate support, and slow reimbursement processes has left a lasting negative impression. For anyone considering flying with Air New Zealand, I recommend being prepared for potential disruptions and ensuring you have a contingency plan in place.

### “the legroom was huge”
Not Verified | I was honestly quite surprised about Air New Zealand! Take note that this was a domestic flight. First up, the legroom was huge. I could literally stretch my legs! Very surprising because it is an A320. Cabin crew came round and bought some snacks, including this new Zealand based cookie, which was delicious. Loved the service, would fly Air NZ again.

### "getting worse by the day"
Not Verified |  Air New Zealand domestic service is getting worse by the day. Flights constantly canceled at the last minute. Tonight is the 3rd time in a row I have ended up staying an extra night because of all manner of 'weather' and 'engine trouble' excuses. If there was any alternative I would definitely be using it.

### "never fly Air New Zealand again"
Air New Zealand bumped us off our flight on the 30/06/2024. We were on time, but they made us adjust our luggage saying we were over weight. Which we weren't as we had just weighed our bags. The Air NZ CSA at check in got our flight number wrong several times as well. She wouldn't listen. They could tell we had a connecting international flight so they charged us $100 NZ extra to change. We had no choice but to pay as they hold the monopoly on regional air travel. Do not fly with Air NZ. The Customer Communication and Engagement Specialist told later after our holiday us that we would get a refund and that they would make it right later on which was a lie. In the end they just kept saying this until they finally said the $100 charge was valid. She did nothing to address the customer service agent rude unprofessional behaviour. From now on we will drive to Auckland and spend the money we would have spent on flights on a few nights in an up market Hotel and on car storage. I estimate that we would have $400 in change still. I will never fly Air New Zealand again. Garbage militant service.

### "has been going downhill"
Not Verified |   Very unfortunately the service, care, and quality of this airline has been going downhill ever since 10-15 years ago. It's either lack of staff training, or proper leadership that is me looking for alternatives and every paying more just so to avoid Air New Zealand. This is especially sad for me as I have friends that work at this airline and I've been a loyal customer for many years. The last few flights I've had with Air NZ, the customer service representatives provide wrong information, don't hold themselves accountable, try to shift their mistakes to me so that they are not getting in trouble by owning their  mistake! Very disappointed to see the lack of integrity across the board. This was not the case in the past! Quality of food on the planes have declined greatly, and so has the service when onboard. We may get one flight attendant that is a pleasure, but many are not. In general, I see no hope for improvement as I've tried to contact the management team to voice my concerns and feedback, but no own cares. They originally quoted me a $50 change fee on a ticket, which they later called and said they made a mistake and the fee is $3000+! They said "Sorry. Now you have to pay $3K more. Our representative made a mistake. But first they tried to make up excuses and make it sound like I misunderstood.

### "Cabin crew and aircraft were great"
Check-in was efficient; boarding and departure were late. There seems to be a late departure problem from Auckland for most flights of all airlines - something to do with ground crew I suspect, having observed them. Cabin crew and aircraft were great - Air New Zealand seem to have the most genuine, caring, friendly cabin crew in the sky. Seats were clean, reasonably comfortable and pretty much as most economy seats are on the newer A320 Neo. Air New Zealand work their economy fares on the system of "you get what you pay for", so the basic fare is added to if you want meals or checked baggage or seat choices, etc. It works very well. Service was excellent and some time was made up in the flight duration so arrival wasn't too late.

### "Such ugly customer service"
Not Verified |   Air NZ sold a connecting flight then didn’t wait for it to arrive and left 30 minutes before it landed. My mum missed her international flight and they wouldn’t help her over the phone and said it was United’s problem. United referred her back to Air NZ where she bought the tickets originally. Now she’s stuck for multiple nights at the airport with no one willing to help her rebook and they aren’t even covering the full accomodation costs. Such ugly customer service from air New Zealand, I urge everyone to look elsewhere when booking.

### “professional and very sympathetic”
Not Verified |  Missed my flight due to my own stupidity. The ticket sales desk operators were both professional and very sympathetic. Thank-you Rahjiv, you're an absolute credit to your company and thanks Air New Zealand for the smooth rebooking.

### “Absolutely hopeless”
Not Verified | Absolutely hopeless cancellation then delays. Will never fly them again not in this lifetime. Needs a management restructure and a big clean out of top end.

### “they still withdrew the funds”
Not Verified | I put in a bid for an upgrade using their “one up” program. On the day of travel they emailed me to say my bid was not successful. However, they still withdrew the funds from my account for the upgrade. Now I am in a position where I am asking an airline to make a refund. We all know how difficult and time consuming that is.

### "not a single aspect this airline does well"
These guys shouldn’t be allowed to use New Zealand. It’s embarrassing and tricks New Zealanders into having brand loyalty to them. There’s not a single aspect this airline does well. Never thought the day would come when I would say this but you’re better off saving some money and flying Jetstar.

### "an airline to avoid"
I travel often and fly with many airlines. Air New Zealand has to be the worst in condescending service and unnecessary process. I’m writing this review after 5 flights with them in the last 10 days (and unfortunately another 3 to go). The boarding process is peculiar with word choices such as “you can board when invited”. To be clear I wait till I’m called and don’t understand the notion of people jumping queues. But the word choice of invite is the first passive aggressive experience as part of the flight experience A week ago I flew Air NZ and for the first time in my life I was reprimanded by the hostess for not watching (I was listening) the in flight safety. I told her I’m listening and she said “well you should watch” Checking in today my bag was 32.7kg. I appreciate there needs to be a limit, but there’s no discretion. I’m flying business class for a three week trip. I then removed a few items and the scale said 32.0kg. I was then told it has to be under 32 which necessitated me to refute that point. Grudgingly, the person then put the case through and gave me the *sigh* treatment. Getting onto the flight, the first thing the host says is the incoming flight’s passengers “ was a 9 out of 10, so you have a high standard to live up to”. Whilst I 100% understand this was meant in humour, it’s symptomatic of an airline that doesn’t want to serve. These experiences alongside poor food on the flights, no pyjamas on overnight business and frankly the weirdest business class layout with no privacy makes this an airline to avoid. Unless of course you want to feel like you’re being done a favour for something you paid for. It’s relatively good value for money (at prices that are still stubbornly high) but you need to take into consideration the places they skimp on. Compares very poorly to leaders in the industry such as Qatar, Emirates and Singapore Air.

### "Highly unreliable schedule"
Not Verified |   Highly unreliable schedule with long delays which is my first priority for traveling. This business has wasted many hours of my time over the past year and always broke my plans during trips. They will be my last choice in future travels.

### "Seat was spacious and comfortable"
A good, easy flight in Premium Economy. Seat was spacious and comfortable. Food was good - we were served dinner and breakfast, and each meal consisted of a choice of 3 main dishes, along with various side dishes - they were plentiful and generous, and the quality was excellent. There was a choice of 5 wines (possibly the same selection as Economy Class) served in glassware. Service was polite and efficient, but not particularly warm or energetic - but still, nothing to complain about. The IFE was excellent - a really good selection of new movies, including some great 'alternative' cinema. A good flight, and departed and arrived on time.

### "Air hostess totally ignored myself"
Air hostess totally ignored myself and guy behind me, spent more time looking at the carpet. On the other route hostess were too busy, so much for touch screen ordering, if it doesn't work then why have it. The hostess often walked pass going to forward cabins with drinks etc. Seats were fine and plane was on time

### "treated me very disrespectful"
I am using the Air New Zealand from past 20 years. One of the cabin crew was very rude when requested for something missing in my plate, she treated me very disrespectful and told me they carry limited food on the plane, which I understand. When I requested to change my son's food, she said no, no sorry or thank you. I felt like she treated me like first time I am on plane. Rest of the staff fine and they understand the NZ level of Customer service.

### "slightly unpleasant oddness"
Whilst being at the front of the plane with a flat bed is always much better than otherwise, be prepared for the slightly unpleasant oddness that is biz class on Air New Zealand. In short. Because of the herringbone forward facing layout. You look at other people's feet whilst seated and b. If you have a window seat you have to turn your head 120 degrees to see out of the window. On this flight they gave socks as a gift in the business cabin One could assume this is a mitigation strategy for all the visible feet. Flat bed is very comfortable. Some staff seem overly busy and rushed, later in the flight things seemed better from a service perspective, however the little things i have come to expect in business class arent here. Such as a personal welcome and staff knowing my name. Food, Surprisingly good. Wine unsurprisingly, excellent.

### "suggest avoiding Air New Zealand"
I had a concerning experience with Air New Zealand. It seems they prioritize cost-cutting over customer satisfaction, as they will try to switch you to a cheaper flight whenever possible. I was put in this situation and had no choice but to accept the change if I wanted to get back home. Moreover, I received poor treatment from their staff, which was disappointing and almost discriminatory. Their customer service did not address my concerns adequately. I suggest avoiding Air New Zealand and suggest looking at other airlines like Qantas or Jetstar.

### "Never fly with them again!
I travelled with Air Newland a number of times in the past and was generally happy with their service. But I was very disappointed this time when I took my parents to South Island. We paid over A$700 for return tickets, during the 3 hours flights, we had to buy the food and drink ourselves. It looks that Air NZ is so desperate for money and greedy. In addition, the services provided were just as the budget airlines. Never fly with them again!

### "A comfortable flight"
A comfortable flight in a well appointed aircraft. Great range of TV and movies. Staff professional and regularly offering water. We had paid more than the Jetstar offering and you do get what you pay for. We had booked “the works” meaning meals and entertainment were included. Staff were visible, great in seeing who did not and who did have the works

### "Poor communication"
5.5 hour delay. Poor communication. No vouchers offered. Customer service only offered apologies, which is acceptable for 2 hour delay but this is ridiculous

### “An incredibly painful process”
Not Verified | An incredibly painful process. I understand that people are very busy, but the wait times were so long that my case was passed around multiple agents and it felt like they came to the case without paying any attention to the messages that had already transpired. It did not feel like the agents had taken time to read what had already been discussed and the information I was being given was inconsistent depending on who I was talking to. I have lost time and money in this process and have come away feeling very frustrated. If you didn't have a monopoly on air travel in NZ, you would have lost a customer today.

### "again I am disappointed"
Not Verified | 
Unfortunately again I am disappointed. Flight to Tokyo was delayed due to technical condition of the plane. Return- cancelled with no support (no alternative flight, explanation, etc). Helpline not working. Eventually I managed to book a flight with Quantas to avoid being stuck in Tokyo on my own cost - good I have insurance. Never again as in previous flights to NY ANZ did similar thing.

### "flight credit rather than a refund"
Not Verified |  Booked flights and the airline cancelled my ticket. all I got was flight credit rather than a refund, now the prices have gone up and I have to pay almost double for the same flights I originally purchased.

### “customer service was abysmal”
Not Verified | My son was on NZ8161 to Gisborne on 15/1/24. We PAID extra as he was an unaccompanied minor - Harlan Pere. Hes 11 [his brother was travelling with him but he is 13]. Checked in for the flight at special assistance as normal. Flight was slightly delayed. Then flight was called. Lined the boys up in the line but was very surprised as all their previous flights - [a couple of times a year for the last several years] unaccompanied minors have been called first. EVERY SINGLE TIME! When the boys got to the gate and swiped their boarding passes, that's when the gate agent realised there was a minor on the flight. Kelly, the most unprofessional, rude and disgustingly inept gate agent I have ever met, then decided the boys needed to stand to the side and be boarded last. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE! When we queried why they weren't called first Kelly informed me that Air NZ never calls for unaccompanied minors before a flight and she had never done this in her 8 years working there. THIS IS A LIE! When I asked to speak to a supervisor she said she was the supervisor. When I asked for someone higher up to make a complaint Kelly told me she was the highest person. When I asked for the name of her supervisor so I could make a complaint she refused to give me this information as well as her last name. All of this was getting very loud - she was just as loud, and I had to tell her several times to listen to what I was saying and not talk over me. At this stage there is approx 200 people in the AIR NZ departure lounge listening to this heated discussion. As well as the boys who were confused why there were being held back. No one explained it to them from Air NZ. I went back to the Special assistance desk and they pointed me to the Premium check in desk and I spoke to Marianne - Team Manager - who listened and confirmed that Kellys behaviour, attitude and customer service was abysmal. Several people I don't know came up to me after and said it was shocking and I should complain about Kelly and her incompetent service. Mariana did her best to listen but Kelly is disgraceful. I have paid extra for this service, been lied to, been yelled at, been dismissed and made to feel like we were the issue as we didnt bring him up sooner when we were never informed by Special Assistance this was now a requirement. If the policy has changed [which Mariana confirmed hadn't] or Kelly didn't pick up there were unaccompanied Minors on the flight all she had to do was apologise and say a mistake was made. Not flat out argue and lie in front of 200 people that she was right and MINORS HAVE NEVER BEEN called in her 8 years doing the job.

### "certainly will not fly them again"
I would strongly recommend avoiding Air New Zealand if possible. I certainly will not fly them again - my experience was so poor that I will go so far as to change my travel plans to avoid flying with them. My first concern is the nickel and diming that this greedy airline does for its customer. In fact, I say Air New Zealand is worse than Spirit Airline in this regard. Your ticket gets you a seat only - you need to pay extra for a suitcase, a seat to ensure you and anyone you are traveling with can sit together (yes, they will separate you even if you purchase tickets together), and changes (even if the other flight has open seats). My second concern is the abysmal customer service. Gate agents are unable to help and require you to leave security for any and all questions. My gate agent was lovely enough to yell at me that she would not be able to help me before I even asked my question (I wish I was exaggerating). My experience with the help desk was worse. I waited for 10 minutes as two free agents refused to help the line. I also had two separate agents help men before me who walked up to the desk after those of us in line had already been waiting 10+ minutes. When I did finally get them to be willing to help me, they refused to answer my question of how much it would cost to switch flights to an earlier one. Their response was a condescending, “too much, hun. Your flight is only in two hours. Why don’t you just wait?” My third complaint is the lack of respect to inform customers of delays in a timely manner. My flight was supposed to board at 1:40 pm. At 1:35 pm, we were informed that the previously flight was arriving late and we would be delayed by an hour. Note, they had also known about this for at least 45 minutes, but refused to share the information.

### "flight was superb"
I'd booked air NZ being Koru but I ended up paying 75Euro from Dublin so this was disappointing hence the one point down instead of 10 which is very generous as Koru isn't cheap. I flew along way and still flying (Air NZ) tomorrow to get to my island roughly 33 hours flying. Anyhow, to the NZ27 flight - from the get go the Male Purser/Manager was fantastic. All staff in economy treated you like you mattered which is rare. Spoilt throughout the night to have staff come down the aisles asking if wanted a snack and water, and then attended when you requested another drink. The rapport already with customers excellent esp. with families - massive credit to the empathy and compassion to accommodate and treat your clients like each one mattered. The ability for me to connect to do my work over the 15.5 hour flight was superb and the fact we didn't have to pay internet was a great Xmas treat. Thank you so much for restoring faith in the airline (albeit it's fine re: the Koru thing) but just the service. Fakaue lahi mahaki/Thank you.

### "change flights with no notice"
Not Verified |  This used to be so good, but now they just love their monopoly position and totally ignore customers. They change flights with no notice and do not even try to accommodate passengers, you are left totally on your own

### “Service was very slow”
A connecting flight at SIN, we had to change terminals but we had just enough time to board the plane. Boarding was done by groups (first Business and Gold members and then according the row). Economy seats were standard, there were pillow and blanket, and also there were ear phones (not great quality) on the seats. We left the gate on time but were taxing almost 45 minutes. Service started after one hour and was very slow. First serving special meals and then the rest, but after almost 20 minutes. You had to wait for dinks for a long time. There was option of 2 meals and for drinks there was beer and wine and beverages. I can not get used to wooden utensils. Cabin crew was very attending and friendly but there were only 3 on each corridor serving and the rest in the galley. IFE was limited and outdated, should do something better. Two hours before landing they started second meal and were OK because they were slow so it was just enough time before landing. Announcements from the pilot was just enough. It was an all right flight and if the cabin crew was not so friendly it could be an indifferent flight. IFE should be upgraded.

### “Cabin crew was very friendly”
Check in was done by machines and dropping of the suitcase was done by yourself. Plane was a new and clean A321neo. Boarding was done from the front door up to raw 15 by aerobridge and the rest rows from the back door with a stair. Cabin crew was very friendly. There was no WiFi but there was a Bluetooth option. Service was a coffee, water option with cookie or bar option. The pilot was describing the route and what we were seeing. It was a great flight.

### "shocked at how bad it has become"
Not Verified | Air New Zealand seems to have slipped badly since I last used the airline. I was accompanying an infrequent flyer. We printed bag tags at the kiosk. There was no indication that there was also a boarding pass printed out. No indication of what bag drop to go to. No gate number on the boarding pass. The service and assistance of Air New Zealand staff at Auckland Airport is zero. They prefer to stand around chatting to each other and ignore passengers. They just wave their arm in the general direction of where you're meant to go. No proper instructions. When I said that it was a shoddy system the staff member just laughed and said move along. The staff I spoke to were very rude and dismissive. Also, the staff member at the gate did not take kindly to being asked whether passengers could go to the gate. There is no information on what bag drop to go to. Constantly had to walk around looking for staff to ask who waved in the general direction of a bag drop or where to find the gate reference. I have heard that Air New Zealand service has deteriorated but was shocked at how bad it has become.

### "Will not fly again"
Not Verified |  Pick up your own bags each connecting flight. Pay high money for the ticket, but don't expect the airline to send your luggage to your final destination. Company is cheap and will probably face problems anyway. Will not fly again.

### "incapable of leaving on time"
Not Verified |  This airline is incapable of leaving on time. This is my 4th flight in one week, all have left late, one by an hour. They can't even meet their own revised times. Sydney to Auckland last week was delayed from 9.20 to 10am 3 hours before, pushed back around 10.20. Auckland/Sydney today at 7.55pm was delayed to 8.20pm around 7.55, it's now 8.30 and we're still not pushed back.

### "service became terrible since Covid-19"
I have been flying only on Air New Zealand for business and it will be the last time. The service became terrible since Covid-19. The recognition upgrade are not processed in time for frequent flyers. Arrogant aircrew when you raise the issue

### "total lack of empathy and compassion"
Not Verified |  My 19 year old daughter's domestic flight home from Wellington was cancelled twice leaving her stranded in the airport overnight. She tried to explain to Air NZ staff that she was travelling alone and had no money to stay in the airport hotels the response was "as per our policy we are not obligated to provide you with overnight accommodation as the flights are canceled due to weather conditions". I tried calling the customer service line on her behalf and waited an hour to speak to a human being. When I explained that she had an urgent medical appointment the next day and that she suffered from anxiety and other mental health issues the customer service rep rang and spoke to the team leader at the airport to ask if they could at least sort somewhere for her to stay. The team leader then informed my daughter that she would need to stay in the airport and return to the desk the following morning and they would try get her on a flight so she could make her medical appointment. When my daughter asked if she could at least gain access to the Koru Lounge as she was scared of being alone she was told "no". Feeling totally overwhelmed, stressed to the max and upset she was left totally alone in the airport terminal overnight as the Air NZ staff went home. A kind security guard fetched her a blanket and a policeman stopped to ask if she was ok as she lay on the ground trying to get some rest in an empty terminal. She was even asked to move from the couch outside the Rydges Wellington Airport hotel and told "it wasn't a good look for the hotel having someone lying down" (at 3am in the morning). The morning flight was full so she ended up missing her appointment and receiving the treatment she desperately needed and spent a total of 24 hours marooned at the airport alone. Whether your policy states you are not obliged to offer accommodation Air NZ, shame on you for leaving a vulnerable young woman alone in the airport! As a parent I'm disgusted at your total lack of empathy and compassion. I will not be using Air NZ again if there is another alternative.

### "airline has declined significantly"
My tickets clearly stated 2 x 23kgs checked bags per person but on check in on the first flight we were told we could only check one bag each. After some time and effort we did manage to get our bags checked. I asked would we have issues on the other 3 flights we had booked was was told yes, even though the ticket is clear. I called customer service and was directed to leave a voicemail and someone would ring me back within 72 hours. There has been no reply - 19 days later. I called again the day before we were due to check in on the next leg of our trip. Customer service is very busy for air New Zealand and once you get through it takes on hour on hold to get to speak to someone. The person spent an hour looking at the issue and advised he had fixed it and there would be no issue at the next check in. He even confirmed in a voice mail. But when we arrived at the airport we were made to pay for the bags and was advised we were only entitled to one checked bag each. I showed the tickets and asked that they look on the computer as a note had been left - all to no avail so we paid $88 US per extra bag and then tried to claim this back from air New Zealand. I managed to make contact with the CFO and was assured a refund would occur that day and that we would have no further issues. I got the refund a week later after chasing it up myself. At the next airport we were again asked to pay for the bags and would have paid if it wasn’t for a lovely staff member from the codeshare airline who out the bags through as checked hand luggage which she could put through as free. I again contacted air New Zealand and they just make assurances this will never happen again but they are 3 for 3 so far. They offered $150 airport dollars to spend on a future flight with air New Zealand which we will obviously never use. On the outgoing long haul flight Auckland to Los Angeles there was no water or snacks offered. I managed to get a total of just 600 mls of fluid across the 13 hours. They did offer as much wine as you could drink but I don’t drink and alcohol is dehydrated anyway. We also paid for stretch seats where you should have more leg room but in these seats you board last so there was no overhead locker space as many passengers took on 2 x hand luggage to be stowed above. Our paid for space was filled with our one hand luggage bag. This airline has declined significantly from when we last used them. The stretch seats are not worth the additional costs. They are unable to fix the baggage allocations on your ticket and that they advertise on the website with the check in computers and do not care. I would never use this airline, it’s just not worth it.

### "pure and simply daylight robbery"
My wife and I fly regularly with Air NZ back and forth to Queenstown. We have flights for December 2nd 2023 and we now want to leave on November 30th 2023. Our original flight costs are $541.62 in total for one way flights for both passengers but when we go to change the dates by three days Air NZ are asking for a change fee of $601.72 to make the change. This is pure and simply daylight robbery. Furthermore the website will let you book a car, hotel and many other options but you cannot cancel and credit the flight online.

### "customer service has severely declined"
Air New Zealand's customer service has severely declined. It's not easy to contact them through multiple channels. In my recent flights with them, they have cancelled multiple flights and lost baggage without providing any proactive compensation. I can't recommend them any more. Now, we have made it a theme of our trips to allow the first day to accommodate delays and file insurance claims. They have screwed up their Omni Channel Customer Service, and as an elite passenger, you have no means of communicating with them any faster than anyone else. Regardless, all channels are super slow, and most of the time, you’ll be waiting hours on the phone, and you won’t get any responses through chat.

### "experience such a memorable one"
Houston to Auckland. I was travelling to New Zealand for my ankle surgery. My ankle was swollen from my previous flight. But I am so glad Rob was on this flight. He kept checking on me to make sure I was comfortable. I was so glad he was there to help me. Once everyone boarded the flight, he advised me that I could keep my leg elevated during my almost 15 hour flight as the seats were empty. Made sure I had enough water to take my medication throughout the whole flight. He made this experience such a memorable one. And I have never used Air New Zealand for overseas travel. But from this experience I will definitely be using Air New Zealand. The seats were so comfy, a lot more room than any other flights I used previously. Thank you Rob, keep being amazing.

### "Staff were so accommodating"
Staff were so accommodating. After having a back operation I required wheelchair assistance. Staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. Getting me on an earlier flight so as not to sit so long. A difficult flight made easier by the NZ staff.

### "No relevant online interface"
Not Verified |  2 hours on hold. No return calls after disconnection. Disconnected twice. Unreachable via Facebook. No relevant online interface. Basically, if you want customer service to do something as simple as change a reservation, don't look to Air New Zealand for basic customer service, because they will not give it.

### "don’t care about you as a passenger"
Not Verified |  Services run by Air NZ regional are very unreliable. You can expect your flight to be cancelled, your baggage takes 20mins to come out on baggage carousel and if you have a connecting international flight they won’t tag your baggage all the way through. You must collect it in Auckland and the super long wait plus the walk to international will have you missing your flight kit of the country. Leave at least 3hrs between your regional flight and your international to deal with cancellations, delays and no baggage handling staff. Air NZ don’t care about you as a passenger either. Catch the bus instead

### "the flight could not get cancelled"
We could not travel to New Zealand due to not getting our visa on time despite applying for the tourist visa a month in advance. We needed to cancel the flights and after waiting on the line for hours to end, we were told that the flight could not get cancelled, we got nothing back and the operator kept cutting me off and eventually hung up on me mid-sentence when I tried to explain to her our circumstances. What horrible customer service and these people surely do not care. Never will I fly with them anymore.

### "The toilets were pretty disgusting"
Below average is the only way I could only describe this flight. It was super hot in the middle seat most of the way (with no way to change the ventilation as there is no dial anymore), and then cold when I changed with my partner to the window seat. We took off and then heard no announcements about dinner or the actual flight for almost 2 hours. When dinner came through, that was pretty much the only time we saw any staff until breakfast came through 2 hours before we landed. There was one member who did a super fast token walk down the aisle with some red wine bottles but was so quick I couldn't get her attention. The toilets were pretty disgusting all flight. Every time I went in there (I went a few times) there was water (I hope it was water) on the floor so had to put paper towels down and clean it up myself. The tissue box was never restocked. It was the first time flying Air New Zealand that I've noticed such a massive discrepancy between economy and premier economy. It is like they want to give you a bad experience on purpose so you pay the extra to upgrade. But our flights were really expensive anyway because we booked them so far out. The staff were also pretty unfriendly and a little robotic. The food was pretty meh, and the entertainment selection really random. Maybe I will fly Air Canada next time.

### "Very unprofessional"
Very unprofessional, the distance between the domestic and international flight is too far away, its impossible to clear the customs and make it to the domestic on time. The frequency of the shuttle is very less too, managed to rush to the domestic and missed the flight. The next flight was only after 2 hrs and was cancelled and the next flight at 1pm was delayed 2 times.

### "tried 12 hours to get hold of Air NZ"
I booked return ticket from Auckland to Toronto by Air New Zealand. On the way to Toronto, flight cancelled from Vancouver to Toronto. I had to stay overnight there, then flight to Calgary next morning and Toronto from there. On the way back the Air NZ flight cancelled from Toronto. They did not take any responsibility for that. just have provided a link for rebooking which was saying to contact customer service. From Toronto I tried 12 hours to get hold of Air NZ, the customer service did not pick up the call. My family also tried from Auckland to reach Air NZ, there was no response from them. I had no means to pay accommodation and food in Toronto for spending extra days. It was so stressful. Luckily my travel insurance was able to manage a flight by Korean Air. Its a long flight. Door to door I had 37 hours travel on my return. Also I found the meal portion provided by Air NZ is too small.

### "has drastically gone down hill"
Not Verified |  Air New Zealand customer service has drastically gone down hill, I found the staff unfriendly and at times rude. Never have I experienced such behavior before on a flight and hope this to be a one off.

### "handled the situation very well"
I accidentally entered a question wrong for my visa, and was denied and unable to get my boarding pass. This was my honey moon trip and only had 30 minutes before to reapply and get approval. Christopher a manager at the boarding desk, called and got approval for my new visa application over the phone. He handled the situation very well and even with some charm. I'm very grateful how professionally he handled my visa mistake, I wouldn't have been able to board get to my honeymoon without him

### "like the FA’s were being unprofessional"
Not Verified |  The FA’s are a little unprofessional and i’ve noticed this on many flights. I don’t know if Air New Zealand is held to a standard on how they should act, but some crew i feel take the “kiwi” attitude to the next level. On my recent flight we hit some bad turbulence and iI got pretty sick and anxious. The crew were helpful to an extent but also made me worse. When i asked a flight attendant “is this normal?” she told me it wasn’t / it was worse than what is usual and gave me a worried look. Turns out it was completely safe and the pilot had even said this. I understand we are all human but part of a FA’s job is to be reassuring, and maybe not even so honest. When i was up having a stretch, a flight attendant approached me and offered me a drink of sprite as i had been sick before. I really appreciated this and asked for another water too incase i couldn’t handle the soda. She gave me an annoyed look, and when she handed me the water she said “you better be calm now!” in a really passive aggressive tone. Upon arriving, i needed to fill in a card but didn’t have a pen. I asked a FA if i could possibly borrow one. upon handing it to me she  said “don’t you have one in your bag?” which i didn’t, that’s why i asked for a pen. i understood that it was a stressful flight, but I felt very much like the FA’s were being unprofessional.

### "service was excellent"
There was Business class available to go direct to the Gold Coast, Australia so we travelled there on an A321 Neo, we booked a works deluxe ticket where you had no one in the middle seat which was pleasant enough and the service was excellent and we can not fault. We started our journey in Tauranga and as usual loved the lounge where as in Auckland because we are Air New Zealand Gold Elite members we could use the lounge and took about an over packed lounge! We normally fly Business Class and it is in frustrating when one can’t find a seat! We flew back from Brisbane Business Class, lovely lounge in Brisbane and fantastic service on board. The boarding there was excellent only Business class and Gold Elite were able to board first and they were very strict on it so good on them! We love Air New Zealand at all times but we just cannot wait to they sort out their lounge in Auckland!

### "superb staff, great food"
I flew Tauranga/Auckland/LAX return, on NZ6 & NZ3 in Business Class recently. Overall a very good experience and more so due to the great staff the company has on its team. The Tauranga lounge is great, nice and quiet, nice outlook and good food and drink selection. Not so good at the Auckland International lounge, always seems crowded now and as long as you like Curry you’ll like the food. I retreated to my normal spot right down the back with a view of the runway. If there’s one area Air New Zealand can't seem to get right (in NZ that is) it is the boarding procedure. They don’t stagger it properly and hence it’s a stampede with everyone on the flight seemingly claiming to be a Koru Club member and it’s just chaos. Excellent flight across to the US, superb staff, great food, good alcohol and a lovely bed, hence nearly 8 hours of good sleep. They had run out of my first choice for dinner, I wanted the Rib Eye Steak. Nothing else appealed so they made me up a dinner to die for (Free Range chicken) which more than compensated for the unavailability of my first choice. The return flight was equally as enjoyable. Boarding at LAX was a breeze as it was done properly, it was staggered and I wasn’t trampled to death in any stampede. Meals were great (lamb that was so tender), top quality alcohol and the best crew ever and a special shout out to Mel who had everyone’s names memorized right from the start and she worked tirelessly the whole flight. Well done Air New Zealand..

### "Will never travel with them"
Not Verified |  This flight is 17 hour long and the seats in economy are not suitable for this long journey. There is no foot rest which was so surprising and very uncomfortable for this long flight. Even in our US domestic flights we have foot rest. Space between seats are tight. Passenger sitting next to you is almost touching and no way to put your arms on arm rest without touching. And most unfortunate is their food. In such long flight they only offer one meal and a small breakfast not to mention both of them taste bad. There were no snack where other airlines offer snacks in between meals in their 14 hour flights. We are frequent international traveler and flown so many different airlines, so we can compare easily. Will never travel with them when I go to Australia again.

### "flights on this trip were late"
All ANZ flights on this trip were late. This one in particular (NZ8) was delayed for an hour with no announcements, no explanation, no plan for customers who would miss connecting flights. Unacceptable. Skycouch is a nice product but super expensive at $1000 each way when occupied by one person. It works well for 2 children or an adult with 1 child but is too small for 2 adults. Food and what service there is, is the same as the rest of economy. The wifi, while free, did not work.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Best things about Air N.Z. premium economy: 2 check-in bags, excellent food, attentative and professional service. However my seat (in front row) felt cramped due to arm-rest having a traytable. The leather seats & interior felt dated and worn. Bizarrely the air-con was so warm/stuffy. The pilots were outstanding though.

### "Very poor service"
Not Verified |  Air NZ has changed my flights for a return trip Sydney to Wellington. I now need to take 1.5 additional days off work. When I called AirNZ to ask if I could have some small compensation in the form of lounge passes the Air NZ staff member told me that Air NZ could do whatever it wanted to because of the small print in its contract. Very poor service.

### "Seats very cramped"
Not Verified | Seats very cramped except for our original flight to Auckland where we had bulkhead seats; food and food service satisfactory; but we had an outstanding cabin service director. Excellent with passengers and very good at his job...best we have seen. Fight NZ 6 from Auckland to LAX on June 5, 2023.

### "customer service team is terrible"
Not Verified | Their customer service team is terrible. They canceled my flight due to covid and credited my account. I went to rebook today and they said the credit expired (even though their website says I have the rest of the year until my credit expires). The lady I was talking to put me on hold for an hour and then hung up! Still trying to get it sorted but would not recommend this airline. Potentially thousands of dollars down the drain. I have spoken to several of their customer service team in the past and most of them don't know what they are doing.

### "do not recommend"
The worst airline I have flown with. First, they now require a “transit visa” which wasn’t on any of the ticketing or website including the app. Over 50% of the flight did not have this and they had QR codes at ticketing stating we needed to download another app and purchase this Visa in order to board. Only one of the 4 flights for our trip were on time. And when delaying several hours, they were unhelpful and one attendant actually rude. They were other flights available heading in our general direction, and instead of allowing us to change flights, they said we could book a new ticket but would not be refunded or credited any part of our flight since it was only delayed and not canceled - in no way caring that we were now losing our connection and going to be stuck another night in a transfer airport. I  asked if there were upgraded seats available to try and get off the plane faster since we only had 40 minutes to clear customs and catch our next flight- and she informed me they cannot prioritize anyone as they have 150 connections. Also the food is horrible. The apple juice on the flight was delicious and their uniforms are nice. Also appreciated their acknowledgment of the indigenous peoples of the land. Will not fly again and do not recommend.

### "no response to the reimbursement request"
Not Verified | Not Verified | Plane delayed 24h, reimbursement for hotel and dinner & breakfast all fine. But no response to the reimbursement request, and than they are going to complain about breakfast of $20 dollar that didn't have a receipt of all the itemised things I ate. Really? And if you want to leave a review for their customer service, it is not possible.

### "Do not rely on the entertainment"
The flight over was great, we ate breakfast then lunch. On the flight back we had one meal dinner which was good however we arrived at 6:15am and were not given breakfast or even a cup of coffee or tea. It was not a great experience having flown through the night. On top of this our flight to Perth arrival time was changed several times and we arrived too late to collect our rental car and lost a night's accommodation in Geraldton. To top it all off at Auckland airport the delay getting through bio security was a ridiculous 2 hours for us and 3 hours for our friends. It was chaos - hot, only 5 desks had people on them in spite of 2 planes arriving shortly after each other. Do not rely on the entertainment - the films were old and did not change between flights there and back.

### "an unprofessional airline"
My wife and I were booked on flight NZ580 today at 10.00am. We did the online check-in the day before and waited at CHC airport today, printed out baggage tags and boarding passes. Then when we put the suitcases on the drop of belt, my suitcase was accepted without any problem, after a short passport check by a staff member and disappeared. My wife's suitcases were rejected and the staff member was at a loss. So we had to wait 15 minutes for a supervisor to explain that our flight was cancelled and we were now flying NZ538. I then had to walk all over the airport to get my suitcase back. After 20 minutes, that was also done. Then we had to print out tags and boarding passes again and go to the drop off belt again. In addition, my wife would now not be seated next to me, but somewhere else on the plane. At 8:05 a.m. I received a text message telling me that the flight had been cancelled. I have rarely experienced such an unprofessional airline, where the customer is only informed about the cancellation of his flight after handing in his bag and the staff knew nothing about it anyway. Of course, there was no apology, just an "engineering problem".

### "Do not recommend!"
Not Verified |  Thank goodness I never need to fly Air NZ again! Absolutely no sense of urgency, both international flights were over 30 mins late. The first flight was so late we missed our connection. Pilots and attendants do not communicate the reason we sit and sit and sit at the gate. Kiwi people may be laid back but this is not a good quality in an airline! If you have connecting flights you are toast! Do not recommend! Sitting so long at the gate I have time to write this! !

### "does not care about it's customers"
I made an emergency trip and needed to book quickly and ended up with a complaint from this booking which I lodged on 17th of Feb. It is now 26th of April, and the only response I have recieved is an automatic one asking if my complaint has been resolved. I have sent 2 further emails asking for my complaint to be acknowledged. Air New Zealand does not care about it's customers and this is obvious.

### "Very bad experience"
Very bad experience, flights delayed by more than 3 hours after going through customs. Not good traveling with a 6 year old either. Only got a 15 dollar voucher. Water cost 3 dollars in the airport. One of the worse flights. Maybe next time don't use air NZ

### "reconsider my flying options"
Auckland to Melbourne flight on 21 April and encountered several new challenges. Firstly, the economy class seats are quite cramped and lack the option to recline. The headrest cushion pushes your head forward, leaving you in an uncomfortable upright position, with the screen poorly positioned for viewing or resting. The new seats lack low back support and are pretty uncomfortable. There is minimal space under the seat in front of you for a small laptop bag, and the seats above row 28 ABC were reserved for "life craft. A cabin staff informed me that I could only store one bag in the overhead compartment and the other under the seat in front of me. The Works package offers the option to request additional food and drink. I used to be proud of and recommend the high quality, standards and service of Air New Zealand. I don't think I can do this anymore and will reconsider my flying options with this airline.

### "never disappoint me"
I like Air NZ, they never disappoint me, The aircraft was new Boeing 787, good inflight entertainment and service. The flight departed on time, and their app is awesome, they would constantly remind me of the incoming flight.

### "worst airline I have ever dealt with"
Not Verified |  Air New Zealand would have to be the worst airline I have ever dealt with. Due to COVID our flights were cancelled and then and provided a credit, we were asked to reschedule to which we did only to find out we had to pay an additional $220.00 plus each for the rebooking, I don't believe we should have had to pay the additional fees as COVID was out of our control. I now am unable to fly as planned and have called to see if I can obtain a credit for my flight, and have been advised by one-person last week I could change the name on the ticket or receive a further credit. Today I have been advised I am not able to receive a further credit as the ticket was already a credit and if they were to provide me with a credit I would have to pay for the credit and then also for the rebooking fee and whatever other fees they want to add to the next booking. Seriously New Zealand Airlines just lining their own pockets at the expense of their clients. I have to say their customer service team have been quite abrupt to say the least in the way they speak with their customers. Would never ever attempt to fly with this carrier again.

### "not a great experience at all"
First time flew with Air New Zealand on international route, not a great experience at all. Firstly we got tiny earplugs on 12 hours long flight on our way to LA. Couldn't fit at all . when asked for the head phones, we were told that they were for premium economy, which was very surprising as we have been travelled with different airlines too but never had to face this thing before. Secondly, I requested for vegetarian meal and to my surprise, half of the container was broken and had a big hole in it with food all exposed and I was served the food in the same condition by staff. When I notified staff about it, there was no other vegetarian food left on board. The flight was late both ways. We travelled with our 1 year old baby and other child with this flight. But we still have to wait in long queues with others waiting to board. Whereas other airlines show more courtesy to the families with young kids and ask them to board first. That was very disappointing as being national airline but not up to the mark.

### "went above and beyond to help"
An item was left in the seat pocket after the plane arrived at SFO. The Air New Zealand (lost and found) employee located it and quickly assisted us. She was efficient and went above and beyond to help us. We were extremely worried about getting it back. Thank you to the Lost and Found Department!

### "Worst airline to deal with"
Not Verified |  Worst airline to deal with. Just the worst! We booked our flight initially to go to New Zealand over Xmas 2020. The airline canceled the flights due to covid restrictions and refused to issue refunds. Instead we were forced to take flight credit and rebook. We booked again for Mar 2023 but I started having a severe back pain weeks before my flight and it got worse over time. I called up to ask for flight credit again to re-book when my back pain is recovered but no luck. I got told that Air NZ only issue flight credit if there is a life threatening issue! Never going to book a flight with Air New Zealand ever again. Our excitement to visit NZ has vanished over this whole experience.

### "worst flight I’ve ever flown"
I have paid for both of my mom and my seats but requested wheelchair assistance for my 88 year old mom. I called to confirm our seats after 2 hours on hold on the phone. They said I don’t need to pay for our seats since I asked for wheelchair assistance. So they issued me a refund. Somehow, my gut was telling me that I have to pay for our seats again because I’m worried about my mom not being in the aisle. Make the long story short they insisted that we don’t need to pay for seats and we will have better seats. So they issued me a refund for the second time. Now it’s time to leave, we were assigned seats that were almost at the end of the plane. They’re uncomfortable that my old mom didn’t sleep the whole 15 hours flight. Not to mention that they didn’t have enough people to push my mom on her wheelchair in Chicago so I have to push her with our carry on. It was stressful and the worst flight I’ve ever flown.

### "waiting for four weeks for a response"
I had to make an emergency change to my international flight with Air NZ due to a serious illness to an immediate family member. Air NZ customer service were not available to speak to over the phone as they had an over 5hr wait time at the time. I changed my flight through their online tool which charged me an exorbitant flight change fee. After taking the flight and waiting hours on hold I was finally able to get through to their customer service team. They informed me that since I had taken the flight they were not able to do anything (as they only provide customer service for new/unused tickets) and I had to email a different support team. I've been waiting for four weeks for a response from them and have not heard anything back.

### "meals were superb"
I flew recently to LAX and back in Business Class. Its nice being recognized as a regular Air New Zealand customer. The crew on both flights worked tirelessly making sure everyone was sorted and comfortable. The meals were superb and give you the option to add extra items depending on which main course item you choose. The WIFI was fast and I was able to stream video. Snacks were available in the galley, all NZ manufactured items. In both cases after I went to the bathroom after dinner, I came back to find my bed had been nicely prepared for me. A special shout out to the Air New Zealand Ground Manager at check in at LAX's Terminal B.

### "sub standard airline"
Not Verified | The behaviour of Air NZ is disgusting. They are the most unhelpful, arrogant and sub standard airline out there at the moment. Over 12 days I battled with Airnz and their faceless customer services which seemed to be near impossible to contact, satisfactory outcome was never reached so I cancelled 4 flights to fly with opposition. I’m gold status with AirNZ but my wife and I will never choose to fly with them again. Had to go as high as the CEO and needless to say I can see where the mess is starting from

### "fees to reschedule my travel plans"
They incorrectly notified me that my flight was cancelled, when it wasn’t, causing me to incur more than $500 in fees to reschedule my travel plans. And when I called to confirm, the first time I spent 1 hour on hold only to be disconnected, and the next time over 2 1/2 hours to speak to a representative. This airline is totally understaffed and unable to handle any customer service. Check in lines were also absurdly long and the plane so tight, with the seat in font of you right in your face and no leg room due to electrical boxes at your feet. Totally miserable flights and then flight attendant put my jacket under a bag and I didn’t see it, leaving it on the plane. No one to contact and emails go unanswered.

### "disgusted by the service"
Do not waste your time and money. Absolutely disgusted by the service I received from the staff. This airline will dodge you until you are well and truly past the point of frustration. Their staff are trained to purposely give you incorrect information to delay you. Good luck ever getting a refund if your flight gets cancelled. You are unable to contact anyone to speak to a human and unable to request a refund online.

### "refused to give me a refund"
I booked this flight on 7th December for a flight in April 2023 Melbourne - Christchurch arriving at 2.30 pm Just 2 weeks later Air NZ cancelled this flight and offered an alternative flight arriving at 12.30 am the next day, or I could cancel the flight. Not wanting to arrive at 30 min after midnight I canceled the flight. Air NZ have refused to give me a refund only offering me a credit valid for one year. Under Australian and NZ law an air line must offer a reasonable alternative flight or refund the fare. Offering me a flight that arrives at 12.30 am when I planned to arrive at 2.30 pm is surely unreasonable.

### "They are a disgrace"
I flew to the US on the 1st of February and my return flight was booked for the 14th of February. Unfortunately my return flight was cancelled due to Cyclone Gabrielle. The first flight I was able to rebook on was the 20th of February, which means I am stuck in LA with no extra spending money and have had to book another 6 nights accommodation via a credit card. I lost the seat I had booked for my return flight (an Air NZ policy?) and have now been waiting on the phone for 3&1/2 hrs (and still waiting) to book a seat. I am unable to do this online for some stupid reason. I realise Air NZ were not responsible for the cyclone but they are responsible for providing their customers with actual customer service. They should so embarrassed about their shoddy dealing with this emergency. Don’t fly Air NZ. They are a disgrace.

### "no response from Air New Zealand"
Not Verified | We should leave at 14 February at Los Angeles, flight is cancelled, but now a day later we are still in Los Angeles and no response from Air New Zealand only one text message at 08.55 pm, with message that plane is leaving at 08.55 pm on the same day.

### "the most unpleasant experience"
Avoid this airline at all costs. There is not one positive thing that I can say about Air New Zealand. Customer Service never answer the telephone. I made numerous calls to try and pre-book sports equipment and vegetarian meals, but all went unanswered. In the end a kind gentleman at Lufthansa (our main carrier) did this for me. I flew economy fair enough, but assumed I would at least get a seat to sit in. Sadly no, the passenger sitting next to me was very large and the seats very small, he put up the arm rest and occupied half of my seat plus all of his own throughout the entire flight. It was without doubt the most unpleasant experience I have ever endured on an aircraft. I discreetly complained to the cabin crew and asked to be moved, however they just laughed, told me the flight was full and studiously ignored me for the rest of the flight. Finally to cap it all our flight was diverted from Auckland to Christchurch due to flooding at Auckland. Here we were abandoned by Air New Zealand, but only after they announced that there was no accommodation available in Christchurch and there would be no flights back to Auckland for at least two days. We made our own way to Auckland (a bit of a road/sea/road/flight adventure) arriving 30hrs later. Obviously it is not possible to get help or complain to Air New Zealand by telephone because they never answer the phone. I did however email my complaints and surprisingly received a relatively quick response asking for all the information a second time. Regarding the diverted flight I await their decision as to whether they will refund the costs I incurred. Regarding the seating arrangements they simply said that they were sorry and that there is nothing they can do when situations such as this arise. Well perhaps they should not seek to maximise profits by reducing seat size (yes I did measure the seats and Lufthansa’s were bigger!) and expecting your average size adult to accept half a seat instead of a whole one. Choose another airline!

### "pure disaster to Lounge"
Check in and service at the airport pure disaster to Lounge. Almost no staff, 2 counters only for premium check in. Pure chaos and no staff Staff prefer to hug known passengers and chat with them. Premium looks different. Check in und Service am Flughafen reine Katastrophe bis Louge. Fast kein Personal, 2 Schalter nur für Premium Check in. Chaos pur und kein Personal Personal umarmt lieber bekannte Passagiere und quatscht mit denen. Premium sieht anders aus.

### "We had a great flight"
We had a great flight with air new Zealand. Easy check in online and selecting seats. The flight was slightly late departing due to cyclone Gabrielle coming in. The cabin was clean and crew were really welcoming and efficient. The seat was comfy for me (5 ft 4inches) and with the foot rest up I was able to nap. The food was from part of the business class menu and was tasty and a good size serving. Slight negative was entertainment as not a large new movie selection but the flight was only 3.5 hours. Happy to recommend.

### "not book with this airline in the future"
Not Verified |  I had booked a flight for my husband and me for a flight from Wellington to Christchurch on February 13, 2013. Unfortunately, my American Airlines flight from Dallas to Auckland on February 1 was cancelled due to an ice storm in Dallas. American Airlines could not get me a new flight arriving in Auckland until February 14 at the earliest, so I had to cancel my entire trip to New Zealand. I spoke to an Air New Zealand customer service agent (after being on hold for 2 hours.) I explained the situation. The agent checked with her supervisor and relayed to me the bad news that I would not get a refund (tickets cost $170). I was told I could change the flight dates with a change flight fee of $64.72 for the two tickets, but I had to pick now the new fly date. Furthermore, she said I couldn't book past January 2024. (I plan to rebook my flight to New Zealand for February 2024.) So if I booked 2 tickets for some random date in January, then changed them when I finalized my travel dates for February 2024, I would have to pay a flight change fee again of $64.72. Given that my international flight was cancelled due to weather which was beyond my control, it seems reasonable that my fare would be refunded, or at least that I be given a travel voucher to use in the future. I will not book with this airline in the future.

### "friendliness of the crew"
This was a code share with Singapore Airlines from Paris to Auckland and on the return Auckland to Singapore leg SIA booked me on Air NZ. After flying 2 legs in Singapore Airlines premium economy the Air NZ seating was vastly superior, both comfort and space. Same 2-4-2 seating but in each row of middle four there was one seat empty so the configuration in the middle was actually 1-2. After reading so much bad press about Air NZ it was a surprise that the cabin crew made a huge effort to walk around the premium economy cabin and introduce themselves to each passenger by name, there was also a hot towel. But what made the Air NZ premium product vastly superior was the friendliness of the crew, they made an effort to replenish drinks and chat to customers and provided excellent service! Now the management of Air NZ need to catch up with their crew and improve their EU website which is a disaster, I actually tried to book this trip on AIR NZ but the website was useless.

### "was very impressed"
Very good entertainment screens. Tasty food even though it was a short flight. Good space seats, did have escape row. Had a very good flight, was very impressed.

### "fallen far from acceptable standards"
Air New Zealand The Air New Zealand experience used to be one of the best in the world. Sadly it has fallen off so far, one has to question the upper management decisions. The premium check in at Auckland airport is horrible. Escape the chaos of the normal checkin to be bundled into the chaos of the premium check-in. Just the same do it yourself experience in a small room. The business premier seats now just feel old and poorly thought out. I don't want to directly face every single person boarding the plane. For some stupid reason face away from the window and directly at your fellow passengers. They have a distinct lack of privacy. The seat and cracks were dirty and dusty, it didn't appear to have been cleaned in quite some time, including previous passengers earbuds sitting clearly visible. As I write this onboard I can see fingerprint smears on the seat across from me. Nothing has been wiped down. I did bring this to the attention of the attendant, who did take the feedback and assured would pass it on with thanks. The food was just average. The movie & entertainment selection was pitiful, clearly lacking choice. Further to this anyone who has had to contact and deal with Air new Zealands contact centre in the past year probably understands how dreadful it is. Expect multiple hour wait times just to speak to someone if calling from abroad. I don't know if anyone from Air New Zealand reads this or cares. But if you do - you have fallen far from acceptable standards. It feels as if you no longer care and it shows. Poor. Zero wow factor. Fly someone else when possible.

### 2crew were friendly and attentive"
Not Verified |  The business class experience with Air New Zealand is excellent. The cabin crew were friendly and attentive and nothing was too much trouble for them. The drinks were served well and more was offered, the food was OK, though not brilliant, and the lie flat beds (a mystery to set up, but the crew did it for us) were extremely comfortable. The stand out for us was the excellent customer service on the flight. However, we would not fly the route via Hong Kong again as the code share arrangement with Cathay makes it very difficult to pre-book seats and Air New Zealand customer service on the ground is non existent. A recorded message telling you that there is a three hour queue for the phone to be answered is unacceptable. We tried email and got an answer two weeks later telling us to phone. Ridiculous! We finally solved it by emailing the Air NZ office in Hong Kong and got an almost instant and helpful answer. If they can do it there, why not for UK customers?

### "first flight got delayed"
Our first flight got delayed so much we couldn't make our second flight. We got stuck in Auckland and told to arrange our own accommodation, transport and food. This was because they didn't have the capacity to arrange accommodation for us. We were told in an email we would be reimbursed in 6-8 weeks. 8 weeks later, still no reimbursement. Getting a hotel near the airport was not a small amount of money for us.

### "Disgusting customer service"
Not Verified | Disgusting customer service, if they have any at all. They canceled my second flight and left me with a 6 hour layover and this meant I would miss my event. I tried to call them about it and waited over 4.5 hours on hold, until I eventually gave up. I emailed them and received a reply that it would take 15 to 20 business days for them to answer! If you can, fly with anyone else other than them.

### "cheapest and stingiest airline"
Air New Zealand the cheapest and stingiest airline in the world. On silver tier I have two complimentary lounge passes to use on this flight before I get upgraded to Gold tier. The app shows two lounge passes, but would not load the QR code for the lounge pass via the app. And because of this the lounge staff wouldn’t let me through because she couldn’t scan the code. Air New Zealand you benefitted off charging me 2k a return flight from Auckland to Brisbane on your variable fares and demand pricing schemes.

### "charge premium prices but deliver a budget service"
We took two different carriers on our flight to and from New Zealand so it was easy to compare and contrast the difference between air New Zealand and Cathay Pacific. The food on Air New Zealand was really poor with no variations across their meals and really unpalatable. They offered no vegetarian options - as we couldn't pre-book our meal due to booking originally with a different carrier this was a problem we explained but we were met with a pretty unhelpful server. The entertainment options are limited, the main service person (chief customer service officer or something like that) was really unfriendly and unhelpful and spoke with robotic replies and really like constantly telling you what to do over the microphone. They charge premium prices but they deliver a budget service and budget food leading to a bad experience all round. Cathay Pacific are far better and treat you like a human.

### "Air NZ is really starting to slip"
I booked flights from Melbourne to Christchurch on 23rd December 2022. The flight was a fully flexible "The Works" ticket with insurance for a short 3 hour flight cost me in excess of 1200 dollars AUD. As a Kiwi returning home for Christmas, I decided to take Air New Zealand after the last international experience I had with them went sour but thinking maybe it was a one-off and to give them another go. I majorly regret giving them the benefit of the doubt. Firstly our flight was cancelled for "operational reasons". When the customers quizzed the ground staff they outright lied to us and said a weather event had forced the flight to be cancelled (What they didn't count on was one of the passengers being a travel agent who quickly called the girls at their contact centre and found out they lied). Absolutely no coordination from the ground crew, just told to stand by until the Air NZ contact centre rebooked us or go back to our hotels etc. I had just driven 3 days from Alice Springs across Australia to essentially be lied to and then told to go away. Most of us were rebooked for flights around half an hour later well after Christmas, some not getting home until as late as New Years Eve on rebookings. Widespread disappointment and they frankly did an awful job managing the fallout, especially for an Air NZ crew. Spoke to the travel agent passenger and she had cleverly managed to get herself onto a diversion flight to the Gold Coast before connecting with another Air NZ flight to NZ just in time for Christmas. All at no additional cost as per their legal requirements to make alternative plans for you if fair and reasonable etc. I call the call centre to try to make this arrangement also (given The Works ticket I have), get told that they can do this but I have to PAY for myself to get to the Gold Coast. I confront the staff on the front desk at the airport about this and they sheepishly ignore me, I confirm with the travel agent passenger again if she had to pay and was I entitled to do so like her? She confirms no she didn't have to pay and yes I was entitled to this. I put the questions to them assertively and they attempt to objection handle me (I seriously hate when customer service reps treat customers like their heads are filled with rocks). I speak to a woman from SwissPort who is standing next to them watching all this going on and she very kindly intervenes, confirms what I've been told by the travel agent passenger is the truth, gets me onto a Virgin flight within a matter of less than 60 seconds and the Air NZ crew sheepishly pretend they didn't just shaft me and that someone else from a different organisation actually fixed the issue. Pathetic. But I find a last-minute airport motel room and call it a day. The next day, I head to the Gold Coast. When I land, my bags go missing despite them supposed to be transferred through and waiting with Air NZ for loading. Fortunately, a kind soul from Air NZ actually assisted me with this but arguably it shouldn't happen. Lastly, while the cabin crew on the flight were very nice I got no hot meal. A minor thing by this point but missing bags, cancelled flights, no meal and an appalling response for a 1200 dollar ticket has confirmed what a few travelling Kiwi friends had warned. Air NZ is really starting to slip and its embarrassing.

### "Disappointed by inconvenience"
As tourists, and having travelled lot of other places in New Zelaand and the whole of Australia, cant help hut compare them with other airlines. We found the staff to be rude on two accounts. While we were waiting in the line, she preferred to assist the one behind us giving them priority. As a tourist from another country, you always feel unwelcomed by such acts and suspects about differential treatment becomes evident. In general, people in NZ and Aus are awesome and very welcoming but this incident really shook my opinion about Air New Zealand and its hospitality. When we put our bags, she charges NZD 20 for an additional 300 gms which was actually balances by lower weight of the other bag but the disappointment cane from she not being helpful in finding a solution. I would say Air New Zealand does not depict the true hospitality and warmth of Kiwis as in general Kiwis are great people. Disappointed by inconvenience, we did not complain but paid additional charges as a tourist would do in another country for peaceful trip further.

### "a very disappointing experience"
I booked the ticket with Air New Zealand using my miles with Air Canada. It was a direct flight from Auckland to Tokyo. Overall, it was a very disappointing experience. The ground staff I encountered was unfriendly and unhelpful to say the least. The ground staff member did not listen to my answers, so I had to repeat my final destination three times. Then she kept asking me for the Japanese resident card although I told her twice that I was a Japanese citizen travelling with a Japanese passport, which she was already holding. I asked for an aisle seat, and she never responded to my request. I was assigned seat 63K, a window seat in the last row of the plane. That caused inconvenience not just for me, but for the family who was sitting next to me and travelling with young children. As I was at the airport three hours before the departure and there was no online check-in, I find it difficult to believe that there were no aisle seats available at the time of my check-in. I understand the planes can be full and not all customers' requests can be met, but that should be communicated. I still do not know whether the staff member who "assisted" with my check-in did not hear my request, was not able to fulfil it or simply chose to ignore it. I travel often and I have been through many airports and check-in counters. I rarely encountered staff that was as unfriendly and unhelpful as the staff that I encountered at the Air New Zealand encounter on January 6, 2023. In-flight service also needs improvement. The meals were basic and repetitive. Fudge brownie was served three times during the 10-hour flight? There was no amenity kit that is standard on most international flights. The movie selection was also poor. In addition, the crew did not seem to pay attention to the passengers. When drinks were served between the meals (which happened rarely), the crew seemed to notice only the passengers seating in the aisle seats. My general impression was that they did not seem to recognise that they were there to serve the customers. Compared to Asian airlines like ANA or Korean Air, Air New Zealand service leaves a lot to be desired. Considerable improvements are needed if Air New Zealand is to compete on the global stage. I would think twice before booking the ticket with them again.

### "literally impossible to contact ANZ"
Not Verified | I missed my return flight to NZ from Seoul to Auckland due to bad weather of my other flight (not connected) in Germany. I tried in every ways to contact Air NZ and put my every effort; however, there is literally impossible to contact Air NZ when you are in trouble - I waited phone on line - it took hours but no response; I emailed- no response even after more than a week. In contrast, I wanted to contact customer care of other airline (e.g. Qantas) for my need and was easily accessible and they responded to my needs. Regarding in flight service - on my way to Seoul, I requested a cabin crew to give me two glasses of water. I was surprised to see that he brought water holding the glasses putting his fingers soaking into the water and served it in a disrespected manner I had ever seen. I must say other cabin crew were helpful and respectful except that guy. I don't think Air NZ customer care is up to the standard and meets customer needs. I believe others have similar experience which is not good to build customer loyalty and to be competitive in the market.

### "needs better trained staff"
Not Verified | The worst airline in the whole world. Majority of the staff I work with are unprofessional, under trained, and rude as hell. They don’t even bother helping you when you need it and I had this problem on the way to Hawaii and on the way back home. Prior to my flight back home, I paid $120 to check in an extra bag. Got to the airport checked in. Only at the gate they told me that one of my bags wasn’t loaded onto the plane as I never paid for it. I showed them proof of payment and then only they loaded it. Why wasn’t this done at check in? Oh I know why - I was attended by a new employee who kept giving me death stares and talked as soft as a mouse, half my time wasted was me asking him to repeat himself. He also made me pay double money for my visa as he gave me the wrong information the first time. Seriously this airline needs better trained staff.

### "frustrating experience of lost bags"
Not Verified |  Our family has traveled with Air New Zealand for decades making many trips each year between the US and NZ. It has, in the past been our preferred airline. But dear god, what a complete debacle this last trip has been. From trying to make simple flight changes that took four phone calls and over 8 hours on hold to execute to the latest extremely frustrating experience of lost bags that didn't make the flight. 48 hours later, we are spending over 4/12 hours on hold to try locate, no representative has picked up yet. Seriously poor job Air New Zealand with ridiculously expensive fares charged to boot. Service is worse than a third-world nation. Will we get our bag for Christmas - we hold zero hope we will receive any service or resolution.

### "a budget airline experience"
Unfortunately my experience was exactly as I’ve come to expect from our national carrier. Air New Zealand are operating a budget airline experience at full service prices. The seats on their “new” A320 neo’s are some of the poorest I’ve experienced in a full service carrier. The design of the seat backs feature a hard plastic curved back meaning anything you intend to store in the seat back pocket - forget about it. Tablets and laptops will bend or snap if you attempt to store them here. The seats also offer only a half seat that doesn’t come to the back of your knees even for very short people. The portion size for meals are smaller than the size of an iPhone 14 Pro Max (not an exaggeration) and meal choices were limited after the first 9 rows as they had run out. The cabin was not adequately cleaned as there was food on my armrest and rubbish / chewing gum in the seat pocket in front of me. To top it all off Air New Zealand damaged my luggage for the second time this year.

### "constant rescheduling and cancellations"
I have been very loyal to Air New Zealand for decades even though most of my flights would have issues/delays. But these delays and rescheduling have been beyond of the joke now and I will be making a point of flying with a different airline from now on and I recommend if you want quality service that you don't fly with Air New Zealand anymore. The problem with Air New Zealand is their attitude with their constant rescheduling and cancellations, they don't care. If I ran my business like Air New Zealand does I would be out of business as they don't care about the customer and the upheaval they create on each flight. Prime example is my last flight (and almost every flight) I finally get 3 days away from work to fly away and again a last minute cancellation which I had to rebook and we loss 1 day of our 3 day holiday ... this doesn't sound like a big deal but since lock downs this was our first weekend off and since I work 7 days a week this was a holiday I was really looking forward to it. Then on the way home another rescheduling by Air New Zealand. If you ring up to complain, expect over 1 hour (I gave up after 1 1/2hrs) on hold. I love supporting kiwi companies, but enough is enough and i recommend if you can book with another airline - unless you enjoy long waits in airports, losing room bookings, last minute scrambling to reschedule flights, car rentals and appointments. It is no longer worth the stress and effort, I am sure other airlines would give a damn about their customers as I know Air New Zealand doesn't.

### "flight cancelled without notice"
Original flight cancelled without notice. Can’t manage booking online and four hour hold on telephone. I have flown with them several times in the past but won’t do so again!

### "Staff didn't seem to care"
Not Verified |  Staff didn't seem to care. The plane was dirty, everything is self serve, no one to help. I was served a mince and cheese pie as a meal. Seriously this is no longer my national airline, I'm more ashamed of them using the name of New Zealand. Staff still seem to have that elite mantra that they no longer deserve.

### "Very disappointed with Air New Zealand"
Very disappointed with Air New Zealand. I’ll avoid flying with Air New Zealand if I can in the future. On both occasions this year it has departed late, 45mins when flying to US and 0ne hour this time flying to Asia which made me miss a connection in the US and recently bags did not arrive at final destination due to late arrival for connecting flight. Barely had 30mins to run to connecting terminal. Also running out of food in Biz class is a first. On the occasion I’ve flown biz class with other airlines I’ve never experienced this. Portions were very small and I’m a small eater. Barely had any service for snacks in between meals So was quite hungry. Service wasn’t impressive by comparison to other airlines. I think Air New Zealand can do better and spend $ on improving service plus departing on time rather than fancy adverts.

### "cancel and reschedule"
Not Verified |  Air New Zealand cancel and reschedule flights without informing customers. I booked a flight Brisbane to Dunedin via Christchurch to arrive one day before embarking an Antarctic cruise. I made the reservation several months ago but only today found out the Brisbane to Christchurch first leg of the trip had been rescheduled to two hours later meaning it didn't arrive in Christchurch until after the departure time of my second leg to Dunedin Air New Zealand didn't bother to reschedule the second leg or to inform me of the change. I have spent all day on the phone to Air NZ who tell me it is not compact policy to inform customers of changes to their reservations. With flights now booked up for next week I am having to fly on Sunday in order to arrive in Dunedin in time for my afternoon cruise departure. Two extra nights hotel and sustenance, and not so much as an apology from Air NZ. If you are mad enough to make a reservation with these folks make sure you check your reservation on a daily basis. They could change it anytime they like and you would not be informed

### "be careful with the workers at Nukualofa"
You have to be careful with the workers at Nukualofa airport. It seems that they are either ignorant about how to proceed with the boarding or they want to take your money leaving you on the ground and forcing you to buy another ticket without any reason that they can explain. The next day they let us fly without any problem with the same Spanish passports and the same authorisation to enter New Zealand.

### "very stressful situation"
Air New Zealand delayed their flight by 10 hours because staff resting requirements. They sent us an update 12 hours before the flight. We were in Singapore so checked out and went to an airport to talk to someone as we would miss all connecting flights and picking up our fur baby on time where she couldn't stay another night. There was no onefrom Air NZ at singapore Airport, the info center said use their help line. The wait time was 4 hours, by the time we rang them we had 1.5 hours left before the flight we could have re booked. By the time they picked up it was 4 hours later, very stressful situation. We were stuck in an international Airport with no one to talk to except stay on gold 4 hours hoping someone would pick up. You should be ashamed

### "an average experience all round"
Air NZ have been disappointing for some time now. I am one of their premium customers and where possible try not to fly Air NZ, unfortunately they are our national carrier and key option when travelling NZ and overseas. The service, consistency of service and lack of quality business class is disappointing. Hope they get their act together but glad plenty of competition on USA routes has come! Air NZ is overpriced and an average experience all round!

### "the food was outstanding"
Not Verified |  Service was typically Kiwi which was extremely friendly and never fails to deliver, every staff interaction was great and the food was outstanding. The only problem that the FREE wifi wasn't working but has worked well in the past so I think this was an outlier but did not detract from the flight.

### "Air NZ was a huge let down"
Not Verified |  After 3 years of covid, I finally took a trip overseas. Unfortunately Air NZ was a huge let down and I'll probably avoid flying with them again. Here's why: Check in for 300+ passengers was run by 3 staff so our flight boarding was over an hour late (flight delayed 1.5h). On flight service was below average - took 2.5h for the first meal to arrive, no service in-between meals, and staff were standoffish even though I was extremely polite and patient. Second drinks and snacks were unavailable to be ordered. The air hostess told us that the attendants were busy due to "turbulence". We experienced no turbulence through the entire flight. Another air hostess told us we could order food through the screen, but this option told us that the kitchen was unavailable through the entire 9 hour flight. The meal portions were smaller than I remember. Considering the increased prices of tickets, this was quite disappointing. I'd rather try a different airline than ever fly here again Sorry NZ. You've lost a kiwi for life.

### "What has happened to Air New Zealand"
Not Verified |  On 8th November I travelled Sydney to Auckland, Flight NZ102 having paid more for The Works meaning I would receive a meal. It was appalling. Please bear in mind that this class of ticket is considerably more than just Economy. There were three choices, all rather pathetic and chose what I considered to be the best of the three. Salmon with pasta and courgette. Sounds fine but what was served was a small hand palm size portion of pasta with a few peas and sweet corn scattered through the minuscule amount of sauce. It was dry and unpalatable. On this all economy flight the toilet at the front of the cabin next to the flight deck is extremely small and the seat only just reclined slightly. My return flight on NZ 107 22nd November, Auckland to Sydney was quite delayed. Not the airline's fault but no food or beverage voucher offered. This time I was also The Works. Thought it could not possibly be as bad as the previous flight. I was wrong. This time decided to choose meat pie. Atrocious soggy pie complete with gristle in a paper wrapping and impossible to eat with the wooden cutlery as it was not served in a container. I read the packet and was shocked to see that they are pre frozen. Thank goodness for the Kapiti ice cream! What has happened to Air New Zealand that they are cutting corners so much across the Tasman. I have been doing this journey for many years and it used to be a pleasure and something to look forward to. Why oh why is the airline jeopardising its good name?

### "Very disappointed"
Not Verified |  We had all boarded and then it was announced that there will be a 30 mins delay. Surely the staff would have been aware of this delay and not board passengers till issues resolved? But ok, things happen, no big deal. Then the food options were announced, absolutely disgusted with the food choices! Our flight was at 9.30am so obviously breakfast service, 2 choices were muesli with yogurt or egg & sausage fritter - no fruit salad, no bread roll. Nothing! Since we don't eat pork or beef, we ended up not eating anything at all! and the drinks were only served once. I have flown with this airline numerous times and drinks have always been served twice. So after delay flight, we arrived at our destination starving. Prices of fares have gone up while the rest of services provided have gone very down. Very disappointed and will most definitely will only be using this airline as a last resort. (if ever again)

### "seat assignments should not have changed"
Not Verified |  Will never fly again. First, our original flight got canceled the night before due to emergency repair. We then got rescheduled to a later flight which wasn't the worst. But what was unacceptable is that we had assigned seats on row 16 but somehow got put in row 29 which was the last row of the plane. How does that happen. If our original flight got canceled, then assumed those other passengers from original flight would gave also been rescheduled to this flight and seat assignments should not have changed so much where we got put in the worst seats that don't recline and right next to the toilet.

### "completely ignored its customers"
Never before flown with an airline that completely ignored its customers. Despite severe delays that caused us to miss our flight to Los Angeles, the staff on the flight showed no desire to try to help us. They were rude and arrogant when we talked to them. The staff at the information desk did give us a hotel room, but not once did they apologize for the delay and the day we now miss at the destination. Will never recommend anyone to fly with Air New Zealand.

### "you may not receive a refund or hear anything"
Not Verified |  My recent flights with Air New Zealand, for work and personal, have been relatively easy, service was good, only slightly delayed. The fares, however, vary enormously. My advice is to book well ahead. However, this complaint is about a flight I did not take from Christchurch to Wellington on July 17, for work. It was canceled at the last minute because of Covid. Because my meeting was scheduled for that morning, I could not take a later flight. The service person at the airport was very helpful. I later tried to claim a refund online for my seat reservations and advised of the cancelation (the booking was done through my work, which has also been trying to get in touch to claim the refund). Now, I completely understand that Air New Zealand has been facing ongoing severe problems because of the pandemic. But it would be good to get a refund or even to be able to contact the airline. Wait times for the call centre apparently are up to five hours. I emailed them and received a reply one month after the cancelation to apologize for the delay. Since then, neither myself or my workplace have heard anything. A warning to passengers: If your flight gets canceled through no fault of your own, you may not receive a refund or hear anything. This is deplorable. Air New Zealand customer for 50 years.

### "not expecting this from Air NZ"
Going from Auckland I was on premium economy no complaints about that every thing was very good. On my return I was sitting in economy and I was hoping will be very good service specially when you fly long haul flight but everything is was opposite. Food very ordinary, after serving special food al most after 30 minutes later they come with drinks. We have received 2 meals so in my first meal I ate my food couldn't wait for drinks but in breakfast i though I wait for drinks then start my breakfast. By the time i have received the drinks including tea all my meals were cold. Secondly they are very slow in serving meals. The earphones are very cheap. Overall I was not expecting this from Air NZ. Hopefully they will read the review and try to maintain their quality of service in future.

### "bumped to Economy with United"
Not Verified |  In May 22 I booked, very deliberately a direct flight Auckland to San Francisco. 3 days before the flight I was informed the direct flight was not happening, my choice to fly the same day was via LAX. Although I paid a business class flight I would be bumped to Economy with United for the LAX SFO flight. So no big deal you say. But take into consideration one of the busiest hubs in the world, customs, security , pick up bags, drop bags off, travel by bus to the other terminal wait 3 hours in transit, its not the premium and easy trip I paid for. Same issue on return. It was no small thing at 69 to pay extra to avoid these issues, have a comfortable flight , minimise time spent in transit and definitely avoid LAX. And a last minute change making it too costly and difficult to make alternative plans.

### "doing us a favour by showing up"
Not Verified | Boarding was due to start 8:10. Flight time 8:40. The captain strolled in to airport gate around 8:50. Unapologetic and acting like doing us a favour by showing up.

### "interest in passengers non existent"
Not Verified |  Personal interest in passengers non existent. Gone from being best airline to the absolute worst. Not sure why we even book codee share through this airline. Would not honour vouchers into the Lounge, even though we had booked and paid through the Air NZ website and Premium Economy. Flight was code share with Singapore Airlines but even though it was all booked and paid to Air NZ - they didn't want to know.

### "Do NOT ignore your customers"
Not Verified | I am appalled by their lack of customer service. I purchased an Air New Zealand flight through E-dreams back in May 2021. The flight unfortunately had to be cancelled due to border entry restrictions due to the covid outbreak. I have, from July last year, to present day been fighting to get my money back, all 1900 euros of it! I contacted E-dreams, they tell me they are waiting for the refund from Air NZ, I contact Air NZ, they tell me E-dreams holds my money!! I now have an email proof from E-dreams to say that they are still awaiting a refund from Air NZ, which I have now sent to the customer service department, but I doubt I will get any answers because they blatantly ignore all emails I send!! If you are selling your flights through a scam company then you are just as much responsible for fighting our case because the flight (your companies flight) was booked in good faith and the matter of the refund needs to be sorted!! Do NOT ignore your customers! !

### "below standard of an international flight"
Not Verified |  The meals were well below standard of an international flight. Menu had two options for hot cakes and scrambled egg but by the time they reached the middle of the aircraft they only had the one option. They don’t provide you drinking water with the meal. The stewardesses are rude and unwelcoming. The inflight entertainment is limited. The seat is uncomfortable and doesn’t recline. There are no foot rests.

### "lost/misplaced my luggage"
It is incredibly frustrating after a 24 hour plus connected flight and then landing at Auckland from Sydney for the last leg just to find out they somehow lost/misplaced my luggage on the 25th and till now i haven’t got my luggage back after being told that they found it, and that it will be delivered to my address. I haven’t heard anything since, no confirmation or reply to my emails, when the website clearly says I can expect daily updates from them. Calling the baggage services is also a nightmare as you could be waiting on the phone up to 3 hours for someone to decide to pick it up, but so far, i have not had enough time to do that, and only able to wait an hour and nearly 12 minutes before my own life has to take over for other things. Since then, after several calls, including customer service staff who said they cannot help me, nor patch my call through to baggage services, I have not had a satisfactory answer or satisfactory service from Air New Zealand and I am feeling very unimportant. As a last resort after doing their internal survey, which apparently was not even being monitored, i also emailed their feedback team, and i got an automatic response that I might get a response from them in 6-8 weeks no less! Unreal!

### "we were messed around"
Was not seated with my partner whom we booked our flight together on the whole way back to Christchurch from Rarotonga. And our flight Auckland to Christchurch was canceled and we were messed around getting to hotel for the overnight stay.

### "thanks for nothing"
Extremely basic and budget feel airline. Flying regional, which is as basic as it gets anyway, at my mistake I was too late to check in, however, with still 13 minutes on the clock and passengers boarding in process, I was denied any help of getting me on the plane. If anything, staff  was extremely rude in handling the matter. I understand this issue was my fault, however, we’re not on a long haul flight here. Some sort of help would’ve been appreciated and and least a smile on their face goes a long way, thanks for nothing.

### "I felt I was sacrificed"
I checked in and secured my boarding pass. On boarding I was informed your seat has been changed for a better leg room only to discover that I was moved to sit with one of the dreaded gang members in their full regalia. Racial profiling at its best. I felt I was sacrificed.

### "I was so cramped in my seat"
Auckland to Houston. I was excited recently to fly on the much lauded Dreamliner! The food was tasty and enjoyable, the ease of connection to Des Moines, USA was fabulous. But I was so cramped in my seat, it made the journey only just bearable. I’m a good flyer, always enjoy it; it was so disappointing to find the airline has penny pinched on seat comfort for the bulk of their passengers, the economy class folk. I’m a slim 67 kg; I don’t know how larger people could manage it. It puts me off ever travelling there again.

### "they have no value of time"
Christchurch to Nelson. Never ever recommend flying DOMESTIC in New Zealand. Most of the time I see AIR NZ delayed so it spoiled your schedule. First they give reason for delay due to weather. After they put on hold due to not put the fuel on time. They have no value of time. Really feel bad. I have to cancel all the other plans just for AIR NZ.

### "thanked for their incredible service"
After a long work day, my flight home was cancelled due to bad weather. I'd had a series of unpleasant personal events earlier that week so this was the cherry on top for me. I was only in Wellington for the day so had nothing with me and no place to stay, so felt rather overwhelmed and was upset. The Air NZ staff member (male) who was working at 6pm on Wed 17 August turned my day around, reassured me and provided my with a taxi voucher, dinner and food vouchers, and a hotel stay. This man was compassionate and kind and provided amazing service. I'd like to make sure he gets the recognition he deserves, but also that Air NZ is thanked for their incredible service. My experience with the airline staff was pivotal to my week and I am extremely grateful.

### "truly grateful to you all"
Not Verified |  Just had the most wonderful service from the Wellington crew on Flight 562. we were in row 28 I left my handbag behind a staff member called Wesley allowed me off the plane so my nephew and girlfriend could bring it security and then the rest of the flight the staff were so friendly kind and considerate. I dropped a knitting needle and the hostess got down on her knees to look for it. Thank you for allowing me to get my handbag, we fly to Vancouver on Friday to our sons wedding will need that Visa Card. Excellent experience truly grateful to you all.

### "my bag did not arrive"
Not Verified |  I was flying business class, and I am a Gold card holder. On arrival at Auckland, my bag did not arrive. I waited for 30 minutes, and had to queue to give my details, nearly missed my connecting flight. My bag arrived 5 days later, all good. But it was never lost. I was told that it had been taken off for weight reasons because the flight was so full (my bag weighed 17 kg, it was the total weight that was the issue) Two questions - why, when I was paying so much more, and my bag had a “priority “ sticker, was my bag chosen? They Knew all along that the bag wasn't lost! In the meantime, I have had to buy new clothing, including a suit for an important event. This is really poor. I would not have minded waiting for my bag had I known

### "will not fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Auckland to Singapore 30th June, Returning 12th August. The midnight flight to Singapore had no issues. But very disappointing when Air New Zealand decides to blackout the windows after an 8.40 morning departure back to NZ Passengers have only just got up to catch the plane and might have wanted to see some beautiful views on a sunny, clear flight of 8 hours plus. You might have had kids or be a photographer or just an avid flyer who wanted to see the world from your windows....But No. Not on Air New Zealand. They just expect you too sleep after you just woke up. Sad, and will not fly with them again, nor would I recommend a day flight with them. Plenty of airlines with A350s, A380s or 777's.

### "the legroom was terrible"
The expected hectic experience of flying international post covid for the first time was just fine. Air New Zealand ground staff were excellent and organised and the plane was on schedule. In fact they started boarding 45 minutes before takeoff and we left 15 minutes early, arriving 25 minutes early. It was my first experience on the 787 and apart from the 3x3x3 seating it didn't feel like a wide-body. It was cramped and even with my 180cm frame and a 3 hour flight, the legroom was terrible in economy, a far cry from most 747 and A380 aircraft I've flown on. In flight entertainment choices were well suited to under 40s not older passengers. Good food and beverage choices for an economy cabin. Well done to Air NZ for getting it's act back together after a terrible time - maybe worth considering better aircraft than the 787 and slightly more generous legroom.

### "staff were attentive and helpful"
I had to make a quick trip to LAX and back recently, one way in Premium Economy and returning in Business Class. On the outward journey the Premium Economy cabin was full. The staff were amazing and were visible in the cabin through the night. I was impressed with the space in my bulkhead seat. The meals were of very good quality. The return journey started out with a bump at check in at LAX. A lot of people (including myself) did now know that a Travelers Declaration had to be filled out online before you could enter New Zealand. All credit to the manager working the Business Class Check in, she had the patience of a saint dealing with all these confused and mildly angry travelers who know nothing of the Travelers Declaration requirement. When I was in the Star Alliance Lounge later, the same manager from check in made sure I had got the Travelers Declaration sorted and wished me well for the rest of the journey, top marks for remembering me and checking that I was all sorted.. The rest of the journey home was seamless and just like the Air New Zealand of old, pre covid. The staff were attentive and helpful. Nothing was too much bother for the staff. If you wanted a second dessert, no problem, just ask and you will receive. I got up to go to the bathroom after dinner, came back and my bed had been nicely made. The meals were superb and a cut above the already very good meals on the Premium Economy flight over. My only criticism is that the seats definitely feel a lot tighter than the 777’s, especially for sleeping.. Some airlines may have a better hard product, but that Kiwi warmth and kindness just cant be surpassed.

### "Terrible customer service"
They canceled my flight after postponing it 4 times. I was reaccommodated on a flight that same afternoon with a stopover in Auckland. Flight that was also cancelled, having to spend one night at the place of origin and losing payment for my stay at destination. I was waiting 5 hours in the customer service line and they never answered me. The next day I was able to communicate with the intention of getting a flight and there were no flights available, I wanted to claim the full refund of my ticket and they did not want to refund the money, they did not take care of the stay at the place of origin or at the place of destiny. They said that the stay had to be approved in advance, how can I have the stay approved if they never answered the phone after 5 hours on hold? I wanted to change the date of the flight and they wanted to make me pay a fee, I asked them for alternative transportation options (buses, rent a car) to reach my destination and they did not accept it. Terrible customer service, terrible treatment.

### "not going to do international travel with them again"
Not Verified |  So we asked for an upgrade to business class from premium economy which we bought a year ago so they said they will try and after 6 days of nothing they change our flight tickets and downgrade us to economy even though we bought premium. I am very upset and disgraced, not going to do international travel with them again.

### "ANZ only continues to go downhill"
Not Verified |  ANZ only continues to go downhill. Food was less than average, crew barely polite, treated food like it was trash whilst serving. Leant over to window seat I was in the aisle seat with food on the tray. No "excuse me" or apology for being rude. The ambulation of some crew sadly would need PAX to save them in an emergency. Crew member rolled food trolley over my toes they were not extended out into the aisle. Air New Zealand just keeps getting worse. CEO makes endless excuses for 6 hours waiting for the call centre that just don't hold up.

### "Airline did not accept any responsibility"
This is my first experience with Air New Zealand and the worst airline for customer service. My ticket was cancelled and rebooked on a non optimal flight without advising me. On day of departure I was refused check in even when I arrived 3 hours prior to departure, told to go away and book another flight on their customers service number. When I rang was on hold for 2 days getting redirected and hung up on with no resolution. Tried visiting Brisbane office but this has now closed. Airline did not accept any responsibility for their terrible customer service. As such I am out of thousands of dollars from missed connecting flights and accommodation. I will never trust or choose Air New Zealand for my flights.

### "did not offer any assistance"
By far the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. They cancelled my flight and did not offer any assistance or other options. The changes cost me $800 of my own money changing hotels, other flights etc. There was no remorse and not even an apology. I spent 3 hours on hold with no answer on 2 occasions. I will never think to book an Air New Zealand flight again and will certainly not recommend this airline to my family, friends and colleagues. I have no words for how disappointing their ‘customer service’ is. I’m shocked that the airline hasn’t been forced to close their doors with this kind of treatment to a customer. I’ve never sent a negative review in my life but this needs to be shared.

### "Double standards. Terrible airline"
Not Verified |  Terrible service. I paid for a seat which cost me $5 extra on top of my flight. I get on the plane only to find an old lady in my seat. I asked if she’d paid for that seat and she said no and she just sat there. So I decided that I would not pay for my seat allocation again and I would just sit there also. Jumped on my plane today and just sat in the seat that I like only to be told I must sit in my allocated seat. I don’t get it? Am I not given the same treatment as some lady? If somebody can take my seat without paying for it then so should I but nope. Double standards. Terrible airline.

### "Not impressed - particularly at the total dishonesty!"
Don't trust them, we booked Brisbane - Auckland return in Premium economy and they downgraded us to economy with no offer of a refund. I then paid $380AUD to get one leg upgraded back to Premium economy. That's fraud. Waited on the phone for over two hours to be told by the bloke in the call center "tough - that's the way it is". Not impressed - particularly at the total dishonesty!

### "They do not care about their customers"
Due to the pandemic, I have been unable to fly with this airline as of yet. My entire experience with this airline and their service dealing with pandemic related issues was the most frustrating and financially costly experience I have ever had with any airline. My family bought tickets to fly out during the spring of 2020, which for obvious reasons fell through. Over the course of the following two years, we pursued every possible avenue to receive a refund for those tickets as we were either unable to fly due to pandemic restrictions in the US and New Zealand, or in the case of this year, members of my family became financially incapable of travel. Even though we reached out many times to make our case for getting out money back so we could travel when everything was safe and we were all financially stable again, the airline refused to budge on the issue. I ended up having to call in to their service line to personally address the issue rather than approach it through emails. Even after years of dealing with our tickets being held up in purgatory and our financial situation getting worse, the final nail in the coffin came today as I received a $175 phone charge for the 44 minutes I had to be on the phone to get half of my family's money back. After years of dealing with this airline, they only chose to refund us a little less than half of the money that we had to contribute, and only because that was the money we were forced to pay in order to maintain our tickets the last time the cost went up. We still have thousands of dollars held up in tickets we may never be able to use. Always get fully refundable tickets from this airline, do not accept their Disney dollars, and do not give them the opportunity to screw you. They do not care about their customers, and after I take this flight some time in the next few years, whenever my family is financially able to, I will never fly with them again. If they would have refunded us the first few times we tried, I would happily fly with them again, but their terrible customer service and lack of respect for the situations many of their passengers find themselves in during these uncertain times leaves me furious and defeated. I hope to never have to deal with this airline ever again, and I am not looking forward to flying with them for my mandatory trip to get rid of my points that I cannot get back.

### "I will avoid this airline again"
Return tickets for economy (Perth/Auckland) $2400. Expensive because they are the only ones that fly direct on this route. Seats are very narrow and hard to get into. Even though this is almost 8 hour flight you will have to pay extra for any food, drinks and entertainment. I will avoid this airline again and use Jetstar which is cheaper and has the same add on features if you wish to pay extra.

### "allowed us to pay the online price"
We were unable to add luggage via the website. While adding bags at the airport would usually incur a higher cost, the staff allowed us to pay the online price - which was greatly appreciated.

### "Very good service service"
Very good service service, sandy Cornish was outstanding. Meals we had selected were not available, she went all the way to see that we got our selected meals. We appreciate such dedicated staff in Air New Zealand.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flew in comfort on Boeing 787 and felt  more refreshed & hydrated after the flight. Not all business class seats had overhead locker, so I had to put my bag under the ottoman opposite my seat. The seat leather/ottoman isn't that soft, but provided good recline. Having seat sideways gave easy view to passenger(s) on the right, so privacy isn't maximum. The service may be a bit get-it-out-of-the-way at times, but the professionalism & courteousness  was excellent. Some staff very proactive into going their way to help passenger. The food/beverage choices were diverse. Flavours sometimes weren't strong enough though. Lighting can be improved with more colours. The quietness of cabin was nice, but bizarrely despite being at front of airplane turbulence's effect was still very clearly felt. Overall a pleasing flight.

### "Covid is no excuse for this pathetic lack of service"
Not Verified |  Air New Zealand simply offers the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The are understaffed and unable to answer their phones or reply to any queries. Covid is no excuse for this pathetic lack of service. When you get through you are then put on hold again and they don’t come back to you or they cut you off.

### "Great service"
Not Verified | Lovely Cabin Crew. Great service. Seat is good for a short 50min flight like this but not for a long-haul. Everyone followed the mask regulations. Food (Cookies or lollies) were served at the end of flight due to COVID restrictions.

### "not common sense to be offering snacks on disembarkation"
Not Verified |  It is not common sense to be offering snacks on disembarkation - absolutely ridiculous. Space issues, people with needs such as parents with babies, toddlers etc.. passengers needing to connect with other flights. Either offer the in flight service or don't - simple.

### "they are exploiting customers"
Not Verified | I live in Tauranga and travelled to Hamilton to place my two teenage daughters on flights to Wellington. The flight was at 7am with check in 30 minutes prior. The instruction email stated I must be there 30 minutes prior, meaning I should be checking in by 6:30am. A series of events meant I got to the counter at 6:34am, the young male pointed out I was 4 minutes late and went to his manager to let her know. He came back and told me I was too late for this flight and advised I would need to catch another flight and pay extra. When I had arrived at check in there were at least 4 staff prancing around with only 1 open kiosk. When I had words with the manager all 4 staff were suddenly available to offer their opinions on my situation. The manager was rude and spoke down to me. I had no choice but to pay extra for the next flight at 10:15am. Air New Zealand have their customers over a barrel, they are suppose to be our national airline, they are bleeding money so they are exploiting customers. The later flight was delayed and didn’t leave until 10:55am.

### "Pretty appalling behaviour"
Not Verified |  We saw the baggage handlers being very rough with the bags. Then ours came out and it was broken. I took it to the Air NZ desk at Auckland domestic arrivals and the guy wasn't even wearing a mask. He told me "I work alone in this office so why should I wear a mask? I don't have covid. Then he told me: 1. My bag was cheap, that's why it broke. 2. It was too heavy. At 25kg. 3. I overpacked it. 4. Air nz would only pay 60% of the original value of the bag. I emailed them and 2 days later still no response. Pretty appalling behaviour from Air NZ.

### "I don't think I would fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Air NZ I think I would say are one of the worst I have ever flown with. Customer service to book flights and giving the right information is very poor. Kept calling them everyday for flights back to any state in Australia and they would say there aren't any flights, but with family friends I know they have booked flights back to Australia and when I asked they said not possible, I even send them information that has been stated from the Australian government and they had no knowledge about it. They lie too much in the customer service department, I flew with them because some had said they are world class but for me that's nowhere close to being a world class airline. I don't think I would fly with them again.

### "What a bunch of scammers!"
My November flights were canceled and instead of providing a full refund or offering to replace the tickets for other dates, they just credited the amount online - it means that I can use the money within 12 month since cancelation (27 Oct 2021) and guess what - new tickets 5 month in advance for the same time of the day are more expensive now. What a bunch of scammers!

### "booking system is patently unfair"
This review relates to the booking system, Today 20th Sept I tried to book a red zone flight to Australia, while I was entering my passenger details the seat was bought by someone else. Then there were no more seats to any red zone destination, on any date. Less than a minute and they were sold out. Because I was not fast enough, someone else bought my seat from under me. This booking system is patently unfair. I will only fly with Air NZ because I have to.

### "Be very wary of this airline"
Not Verified |  The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced and sneaky tactics with Australians. We booked our flights under a full refund policy they had for Trans Tasman Bubble flights, all flights were under a policy of full refunds for flights before 31st Dec 2021. They then changed the policy when the NZ border closed (yet again) and claimed they never had any knowledge of it. Spoke to a “customer service” representative who basically told me “oh no what a shame. No refunds”. Be very wary of this airline. They clearly have a monopoly in NZ and have been known for their sneaky tactics with customers. Consumer NZ is also investigating these issues. In an uncertain travel climate like this with Covid, avoid these people at all costs.

### "Air New Zealand seem to be exploiting their customers"
Not Verified |  Air New Zealand need to step their game up hugely. First of all, the price of the tickets were extremely high ($500+ one way), and for the inflight service you receive on these flights which is a water, tea or coffee and a biscuit and some lollies, is just way too much. The staff at Dunedin airport do not seem like they want to be there and did not make me feel welcome at all. If only New Zealand had another airline flying domestically and regionally as much as Air New Zealand does! Air New Zealand seem to be exploiting their customers as they are the only airline flying regionally in New Zealand with the exception of Jetstar flying on main routes within New Zealand. Overall unhappy with Air New Zealand.

### "confirmed by Air NZ that they would honor the luggage requirements"
A quick back story, my wife and myself were moving to Spain, we had previously contacted both Airlines (Qatar and Air NZ) and had been confirmed by Air NZ that they would honor the luggage requirements set out by Qatar Airways. Our flight was 1298 on Thursday 26th of August departing at 14.00 from Christchurch to Auckland. Our connecting flight was with Qatar who obviously have different hand luggage requirements than Air NZ. However as we were trying to get through security and to note "we were the only ones passing through security". The male Aviation Security officer who was supposed to screen our bags refused to let us screen our bags stating we could only take 1 piece of luggage onto the aircraft. We explained that we were actually traveling internationally and had already called and confirmed with Qatar Airways that our carry on was acceptable however he insisted that he was unable to screen our bags as it wasn't the acceptable carry on allowance for the Air NZ flight. He stated we would have to check in our hand luggage so we returned downstairs by which time the flight was already closed and we were told by Air NZ staff it was ok to take our hand luggage and to board the plane. Upon returning to Av Sec, another Air NZ service agent who saw us talking with the agent who had checked us in had followed us up to the Aviation Security and as the Av Sec officer again began berating us and firmly insisting that we must leave behind all hand luggage with the exception of a laptop the Air NZ service agent began to join in stating "Either you leave everything except your laptop behind or you are going to miss your flight". Even with my pregnant wife beginning to cry this continued on with being pressured to leave behind our hand luggage except a laptop each and my wife's wedding dress with the Av Sec officer continuing to raise his voice and at one point even throwing plastic security tray towards me and in a raised and angry tone stating "Don't you know laptops have to be placed inside the trays!". After some minutes of this the Air NZ service agent realized that such actions of herself and the Av Sec officer we beginning to escalate too much and reminded the Av Sec officer that he wasn't allowed to be throwing the plastic security trays around and to be careful in front of the other staff. At this point after throwing out some items from our carry on we were finally allowed to place our carry on luggage through security.

### "No refund policy is disgusting"
No refund policy is disgusting. Have had flights with other airlines cancelled due to covid & have received refunds without a problem. No chance I’ll be able to travel to NZ in the next 12 months either but apparently that’s not a good enough reason. Told to just sell the credits. Cost of flights were already exceeding pre covid flights drastically & with all the advertising they had been doing of late you’d think they’d have some kind of courtesy. Hard to contact & just plain rude when you do. Will not be booking with them ever again.

### "now not entitled to a refund"
Air NZ cancellation policy is not with other airlines. The main reason is AirNZ is not bound to ACCC guidelines relating to when an airline cancels a flight. Our example was just that. AirNZ cancelled the flight, the alternative was a 15hour journey around Australia and NZ, which just wasn’t acceptable for my family when the original journey was meant to be 3hours. We are now not entitled to a refund. AirNZ customers service specifically said they are not bound by the ACCC guidelines as they are NZ based. As a contrasting example, our return flight was with Jetstar. We got a refund from them with no questions asked when their flight was cancelled. It blows my mind that an airline like AirNZ hasn’t updated its policies to support COVID scenarios and flexibility like other airlines have adopted. I have no loyalty now nor do I choose to fly with this airline and I will work my hardest to leave this review anywhere I can to assist other future travellers and prevent them from experiencing the same.

### "customer service team were amazing"
I was travelling with my partner through New Zealand during a visit to our hometowns. We currently live in Melbourne and knew that traveling during covid would be a difficult time, but didn’t think that the flight dramas with Qantas we had would be so extensive. We were fortunate enough to have a connecting flight with Air New Zealand within NZ and Nat from Nelson airport went absolutely above and beyond to help us with a flight issue Qantas had created. This issue was not her responsibility to resolve at all but she could see we were in destress and did everything she could to help us change our flights and make a bad situation completely turn around into a positive one. I wish we had just booked all our travel with Air New Zealand from the beginning and have learnt from that mistake! The customer service team were amazing and Nat was a true highlight.

### "refuse to give out any refunds"
Air New Zealand refuse to give out any refunds, even for flights cancelled by the airline itself. More people should know about this unethical practice. I wish I had known when I booked my ticket with the airline! I tried to travel from China to Australia via Auckland, and booked my second leg with Air New Zealand. At no point during the whole booking process was I informed that the flight I was booking was a quarantine-free flight, which, as a transit passenger, I was not eligible for! I only learned of my ineligibility on the travel day, when I was denied boarding at the Chinese airport. All right, no big deal, I can cancel my flights and transit at another city, right? The answer from Air New Zealand is a big NO! All my attempts at contacting the airline on the travel day went into a black hole. I tried calling their call centre during office hour and was put on hold for more than one hour without any answer. I tried emailing them and sending them Facebook messages. Neither produced any response. I only got a short reply on Facebook two days after my original travel day, telling me that they cannot offer any refund. I was sold a product that I cannot use and was not told about it, and it was my fault? Ever since then, the airline has ignored all my requests for refund. A quick look at the recent Air New Zealand reviews online shows that I am far from the only one. Many people had their flights cancelled by the airline itself and could not get their money back. That is just insane! Even their budget airline neighbor JetStar is giving out full refunds for cancelled flights!

### "pathetic service from my national airline"
I booked this ticket online, however due to COVID border closures the flight has now been cancelled. My agent advised me to contact Air NZ to arrange a credit or alternative flight. However after many phone calls Air NZ is not interested in offering me any form of a credit or another flight and state the flight was booked through a third party agent and I am not their problem. Absolutely pathetic service from my national airline. On the same booking I also had a Jetstar flight booked, absolutely no problem to change the booking. I will never ever fly or recommend Air NZ again.

### "Such a bad experience"
Such a stupid experience. I been to airport on time and i was new in the airport and waiting in the line for half an hour for drop of my bag. Nobody told me its a wrong line and after half an hour they aaid go back to drop off area as they are still open byt when i been there, they said drop off area is closed and lady was only rushing to go home. There was still half an hour left to flight take off but She forcefully extended my flight and charge me $100 extra. I was not happy at all, then after charging me she informed me that she didn’t add my luggage in that flight and i need to pay another extra charges to add my luggage. Also she wanna go home and told me to do online. When i was trying to do online then nothing working and i again tang to customer service department and she said because this flight extended from airport so they can’t do online. The phone lady again rebook my flight and charge me another amount for my luggage. Such a bad experience with Air NZ will never book again.

### "Very overrated airline"
Not Verified |  Very overrated airline, stopped me from flying due to circumstances out of my control had to make extra payments because of the situation, doesn’t deserve the praise it gets.

### "crew turning a blind eye is just as disgusting"
Disturbing flight. Currently our government has in place legislation that requires anyone travelling on public transport including planes to wear a face mask, for the first half of the 1.5 hour flight the gentleman next to me positioned his mask over his chin, during the 2nd half of the flight his 3 family members also removed their masks. But what came next was disturbing the 4 family members spent the rest of the flight picking their noses eating their snot and wiping snot over the screens and chairs. The staff were standing next to the family in a regular basis. I raised what happened and was advised cabin crew saw nothing however they were not interested in cleaning the plane before the next passengers boarded. The crew ask one European person in front of me and two European people next to my wife to wear their masks but did nothing around compliance with non European people. I can tell you right now having someone next to you wiping their snot over the craft next to where I was sitting is very sickening Air New Zealand crew turning a blind eye is just as disgusting.

### "I want to know why this happened"
I paid the works for my daughter when I booked her flight from Apia to Auckland, she wasn't given any food at all during her flight, now I want to know why this happened and why should / why did I pay extra for a service that wasn't even provided.

### "The staff were so friendly"
Hobart to Auckland NZ198, inaugural flight 22 April 2021. Brand new aircraft with superb Cabin Crew, just like the flights on former TE from many years ago. Crew probably very happy to be working again, but this is how passengers expect a flight to be, even with lower fares. Aircraft was slightly less than half full, thus plenty of space for the 3 hour plus flight. The staff were so friendly and being an inaugural flight, sparkling wine was flowing freely. Comfortable seats with great video screens which were simple to use. I particularly liked the screen based ordering for drinks and food: Very professional and easy. (The return flight was a little different!). Flight only a few minutes late on arrival, no problem there. Return flight NZ197, 29 April 2021. Older A320, but also with same video screen. Crew were a little less friendly, but very pleasant nonetheless. I ordered and paid for a drink by card (brilliant!). Later an announcement was made that the service was soon closing. I ordered another drink and paid, but this time, it was not delivered to me. I'm not sure if another passenger received a free drink, or whether the aircraft system failed between the time of my order and the service closing. I have pursued this with the airline, and I am waiting on a response from them. Sadly, the return flight was almost empty. There were approximately 30 to 35 passengers on the flight, in an aircraft which seats about 180 passengers. The amount of space was enjoyable, but this does not bode well for a permanent flight on this sector. An Airline needs to make a profit, and I am hoping that passenger numbers will increase. People in New Zealand suggested that it was a little early for this flight to start due to the Corona Virus. Perhaps. I love to fly and I felt perfectly safe. Maybe I was lucky and avoided any health problems, but the precautions were strict and effective in my opinion. I will use this flight again. It is faster and cheaper than travelling via Sydney or Melbourne. I wish Air New Zealand the very best for this new service. It deserves to succeed.

### "very disappointing conduct from Air New Zealand"
Air New Zealand relishes ripping off it's customers and airpoints members: to add an extra bag of 7kg was quoted at $170 extra. The price of the main ticket was only $229.00, but an extra 7kg bag was $170, which is blatant extortion. Customs and border staff bent over backwards, suggesting solutions when items were about to be confiscated and suggested going back to check-in to get the bag added as check-in luggage. It is really disappointing that Air New Zealand sees such situations as an opportunity to engage in immoral and unethical behaviour. No options to upgrade to the works (adding an extra bag) were allowed, and no other options were available. This is very disappointing conduct from Air New Zealand and reflects poorly on the country's carrier. I am ashamed to be a Kiwi today.

### "the most amazing service"
I received a call from Blair in the Blenheim office at 7:30pm informing me that my flight at 7:00 am the next morning was canceled., there were no alternatives to travel out of Blenheim and make my appointment in Wellington the next morning. Blair assisted with getting me a flight out of Nelson and still make my important meeting. He arranged transport to Blenheim and very professionally taken away all the stress that comes with a cancellation. This is by far the most amazing service I have ever had with any airline ever!

### "shifted my wife and I to a Qantas flight"
Air NZ flight cancelled because of Covid in Auckland so they shifted my wife and I to a Qantas flight. No problem with that except we both paid Air NZ $240 for 3 seats configuration, Meals, extra luggage, priority boarding. None of this was received from Qantas. Despite numerous emails with Air NZ they have refused to refund the money for the services we never received, which is illegal. But they don't care. About time Governments stood up for citizens' consumer rights.

### "burning your reputation for a few quick bucks"
So I booked the wrong flight month on Expedia for some reason, miss-click, tired, whatever the reason. Turn up early thankfully, check in can't find you booking, your flights next month, you need to ring Air NZ office, on phone for 15 mins they then go - sorry you booked though Expedia, they need to change the booking. Expedia app wont let me cancel or change flight so I had to pay for new flight. Air NZ makes me pay an extra $5 to choose a seat, all other seats grayed out, well in a rush now so ok, get on plane, planes only 1/3 full, nickle and diming their customers. Flight ok, masks, no food, 1 hour flight so that's ok. Expedia after not cancelling original flight for over a week of requesting that they do so, now tell me on the phone after I ring, Air NZ policy is that you get a credit to be used within 6 months and needs to be for the same person etc. Really burning your reputation for a few quick bucks.

### "I will not fly with Air New Zealand again"
I was never prompted to check in online for my flight to Dunedin as is normally the case, which meant that when I arrived at the airport I was flatly told I could not board despite having paid for a ticket. No rationale was provided, nor was any sympathy given. I was helpfully told that if I hurried over to customer services, they’d kindly change my flight to the next one in two hours for the low price of $100. I accept responsibility for forgetting to press a button on my phone that would have made everything different, but the fact is there is no practical or ethical reason to deny boarding to somebody because they didn’t check in. I had no checked baggage, there was a seat on that plane that I had paid for, but Air New Zealand sees every failure of their own system as an opportunity to milk more money out of their passengers. I will not fly with Air New Zealand again. One might as well fly with JetStar if budget airline service is what Air NZ gives.

### "accept that its my fault that I was late"
Not Verified |  Flight time was 1.25pm at Invercargill airport was reached at 12.58 on check-in kiosk. Kiosk given me ticket check-in closed take to counter. Being to counter and attendant said sorry you need to on next flight which is going through Wellington to Auckland i asked him was just 3 mins late and boarding is not even started. He said sorry cant help. He issued new boarding pass and said i am helping you by not charging you anything. But doesn't even count that i have to take flight via another airport and reach 4 hours later to Auckland. Even explained him situation as well what was happened but no help provided. Was sitting at airport for my next flight NZ8774 boarding time is 13.40pm until 13.53pm boarding gate not even opened. How fair is it that airline can be late for even 13 mins but customer cant be late for 3 mins when boarding is not even started. Shame that we don't have any options to fly without Air New Zealand in New Zealand to some areas where i normally travel. I accept that its my fault that I was late but if boarding not even started why they cant help?

### "cut out the refreshments"
Not Verified |  The flight from Gisborne to Auckland takes just under an hour. During this time passengers are required to wear face marks. Also during this time a drink of water, a cup of tea or coffee, a biscuit and a lolly are offered, all of which require removal of face masks, which pretty much means that people taking advantage of the refreshments spend almost all of the flight unmasked. I for one am quite happy to go without refreshments for an hour and wear a face mask for the entire flight in the interests of my health, which I did. For goodness sake have some common sense and cut out the refreshments on these short flights.

### "The least people can remember is to bring headphones"
Not Verified |  Air New Zealand offers screens for each seat but no headphones, I asked but got told by a air crew that should bring our own. The least people can remember is to bring headphones while going on holidays. Every one (kids) are watching videos with no sound.

### "No refund but instead a credit note"
Was told one day before flying that my flight was cancelled due to being overbooked with social distancing which left me completely stranded. No refund but instead a credit note which I had to chase them to the end of the earth to eventually get.

### "Customer service was extremely poor"
Unfortunately I left my phone wallet behind. So I went to the Air New Zealand deck for help to receive my booking number while she received my problem straight away. She proceeded to continue to chat with the host beside her. After min she said there was nothing we can do I ask can i use a phone or use a computer to access my email. She said no. She didn't even advise me of a telephone booth. And plainly said there is nothing I can do to access my booking number. So I walked off sat down for 5 minutes the decided to walk down to the eatery while my brother returned my wallet. As I did this I noticed two pay phones on the wall I walked down to the eatery to change a note in my pocket. Went back and rang my partner to receive my booking number. Then went to book in to find gate was closed by 6 minutes. So I asked an Air New Zealand assistant to see if I could still get on my flight. But they were more interested in selling me another ticket than helping me. Customer service was extremely poor.

### "Air NZ does NOT enforce masks!"
Air NZ does NOT enforce masks! We flew air NZ form LAX to AKL. My wife had a window seat. There was food residue smeared below the window and on her seatbelt when we sat down. We cleaned this up with antiseptic wipes. The major issue was the family in row 52 who did not wear masks for the whole 12 hour flight and when questioned, staff said they can't force anyone to wear them! We has just flown Air Canada from YVR to LAX and it was compulsory or face a fine. We also flew to quarantine from AKL to CHCH and they were compulsory. But we had to endure 12 hours of 4 people with no masks, the closest 2 ft away. Disgraceful in this time and a mockery of all the efforts and suffering people have endured during this pandemic. We are now in a 14 day quarantine. What do you all think, refund of the ticket for putting customers at risk, not addressing a complaint? I have flown Air NZ for 30 years and at the most critical time in modern aviation history and public health and safety, fell flat and didn't care. Disgusted!

### "Oh the double standards"
On return to Brisbane from NZ in October I had a small bag which I have taken many times as hand held luggage, however I was advised I could not take this on and would have to pay for extra baggage. $170 for 10kg. Yet there was 3 people entitled to 7kg each and we only had this 1 bag. Get on the plane and there is a lot of overhead compartment room and guess what there were other people with the same bag. Then what makes me more annoyed was that I go on a quarantine page and a lady tells us how wonderful Air NZ is because they let her take on 2 extra bags at 25kg each free. Oh the double standards.

### "disgraceful and zero trustworthy airline"
The worst airline booking system ever. I booked a return flight ticket to Wellington for myself and my wife for a short trip over the holiday. We had Airpoints enough to cover the cost of the tickets and we redeemed all the airpoints via their online booking website. We booked a flight and confirmed the departure was at 12:15 PM from Auckland airport. No single email notification was received or any update from Air New Zealand whatsoever. Later close to our departure, we thought it would be good to check our flight schedule, but my wife's flight details were changed to different time without any notification nor any update. We tried rescheduling our flight schedule so we could travel together, but the guy who answered a phone after a long time waiting told us off and saying it was all our fault not calling them when we didnt receive any emails from Air New Zealand. I didnt know it was a passenger's responsibility to track their emailing lists. We ended up paying for extra $$ to reschedule our flight, but we realised, it would have been cheaper if we cancelled the flight rather than rescheduling. They also charged us some payment fees for using Airpoints which was not written anywhere in the terms. This is by far the worst experience we have ever had from airline companies all around the world and we will do our best to avoid using Air New Zealand from now on for the rest of our lives. Oh we will also get all our family members not to use Air New Zealand at all. Terrible, disgraceful and zero trustworthy airline company in conclusion.

### "They sell tickets to cancel them shortly after"
Not Verified |  We bought 2 tickets Sydney-Papeete and they cancelled it 10 days later supposedly because of COVID when the situation has not changed since (no mandatory quarantine in Papeete and no change on restrictions at the NZ border). And they don't even offer us a refund because “it's not they fault”. They sell tickets to cancel them shortly after and thus accumulate credit knowing that some customers will not be able to use or sell it. I absolutely do not recommend Air New Zealand

### "worse than budget airlines"
The absolute worst customer service given the current climate. I had a connected flight booked to Sydney and received an email changing the time only one week after booking. Ten days after this, a week before I was due to fly, I received a second email confirming the time changes from the first, however Air New Zealand had also discreetly changed the date to 3 weeks later, while maintaining the exact same time. I noticed the change two days prior to flying and called the airline in a panic. After being kept on hold, I spoke to a robot like woman who did not once apologise for a) their emails being incorrect b) the fact they had changed the flight dates at all. She provided no solutions, and no reimbursements. There was no way for my to get to Sydney, so in the end I had to pay £800 extra to book a Singapore Airlines operated by Air NZ flight home direct from Auckland. I missed my flight from Sydney to London, the cost of which I have to refrain myself from thinking about as it makes my heart race every time. The customer service was unhelpful - tried to put me on hold, push me to speak to another team, got the dates for the day I wanted to fly which then meant an increase of prices, and incorrectly hold me the price I had eventually forked out also included an extra bag. At the airport that 24kg extra bag was going to cost me $500 on account of Air NZ having a ridiculous fee of $250 per 23kg. If you exceed this there is no oversized fee, but you have to pay for an additional bag. In the end, as I was flying through Singapore Airlines operated by Air NZ the very kind gentleman at the counter (who was on the phone to Air NZ getting rates) took pity on me and wavered the fee. He apologised for Air NZ, and said in times like this when we're all just desperate to get home we need to be kind. That's the attitude I would expect of New Zealand national airline. I will never fly Air NZ ever again. The service I received was worse than budget airlines such as Easy Jet and Ryanair who I always expect to be trying to take my money at every turn. I would not have expected this of Air NZ who leave me £1000 poorer than I was 10 days ago for no reason at all. The flight via Singapore Airlines was exceptional and I will be leaving them a wonderful review!

### "just allowed one 23kg bag per person"
I have a complaint about the service of this company. We bought a flight for today. The flight is from Auckland to Houston. The problem is that they just allowed one 23kg bag per person, so, my partner and me decided to pay an extra bag. This one supposed to be cheaper if we would have payed online, but as the flight has a connection from LA to Houston with United Airlines, we couldn’t do it online. When we called, the customer service attendant told us that the extra bag is going to be 250NZD plus 160NZD of the heavy charge. We didn’t thought that this total payment will be 500NZD in total. They charged 250NZD because of the extra bag and 250NZD because the latter was 32kg. If we had known this, we would have pay 2 extra bag of 250NZD. If you do the maths, they are charging for 46kg and we are carrying on just 32kg. This is how air companies still the money from customers, even in this hard situation that the world is going through. Not even our belongings in that bag have this value, but they are really important for us, so we couldn’t leave it behind. A last thing to add, the front desk attendant was the worst ever. He didn’t even let us explain him the situation, interrupted all the time. Apparently he didn’t speak English, and he laughed in our face all the time.

### "Air NZ you are not being compassionate or considerate"
Air NZ you are not being compassionate or considerate and are only considering yourselves in this COVID time. We booked you in December 2019 (8 tickets SYD-Queenstown) and then COVID hits and Air NZ cancel the flights on us in July for a trip in September 2020. We completely understand as your borders are closed (not our fault or yours), however all you have done is offer a credit for 12 months, which is unacceptable. We now have in excess of $3,500 in credit, return our money as it's our money not yours to hold onto. Some of us have no job, no income with children to feed and you offer no compassion, fix this and do the right thing? We eagerly await your response.

### "won't even refund the flight money"
Not Verified | Was booked in to go home to Fiji, Melbourne to Sydney to Fiji. In the meantime New Zealand had declared a 12 hr max. Layover which my connecting fights exceeded. Although they knew about this they did not notify passengers (all 30 of them) and had to be quarantined in Sydney for 2 nights before return to Melbourne. Now they won't even refund the flight money let alone all the extra expenses. Never fly with them! !

### "great flight with no problems"
Not Verified | Auckland to Sydney in February 2020. It was great flight with no problems. I was unable to pull up my booking on my phone so I had to go to customer service who printed it out. I will fly Air New Zealand whenever I can.

### "treat a customer in such a disgusting manner"
Not Verified | After having my 3rd flight cancelled during the covid 19 I am seriously never going to book another flight with Air New Zealand. I was released from my 14 quarantine. At Auckland after traveling back from Australia only to find my flight from Auckland Had been once again cancelled. This left me stranded in a city with nowhere to go. I had to spend the freezing cold night on the street as the manager at the domestic terminal said they won't provide me with accommodation. This left me worried for my safety and my health. I can not believe an airline would treat a customer in such a disgusting manner and it has left a very bitter taste in my mouth. Thankfully my children weren't with me on this occasion. Finally I was able to get on a flight back to Dunedin the next day. But to rub salt into my wounds my flight which was originally a direct flight was now a 6 hour flight due to having to stop over in Christchurch for 3 hours. I would be very aware if you are booked to fly with Air New Zealand as I find it totally disgusting in the treatment I have received.

### "not entitle you to a refund"
Almost by chance we find on the airline's website that our flight has been canceled. Given the period it is not surprising, what instead upsets is that the ANZ did not consider it advisable to notify us: no mail, no message, nothing. Who knows how long the flight was no longer active without us knowing it. And this is only the beginning! On the site, the only "refund" option is to accept a 12-month voucher. We write rather resentful to the company asking for a full refund, a nice young lady answers us who first asks us for authorization to deal on behalf of all passengers (there are only two passengers and we signed the email on behalf of both) and then she writes us that our type of ticket does not entitle you to a refund but only to a voucher, which we will soon receive. I would add that the toll-free number for Italian customers on the company's website is non-existent. Quasi per caso scopriamo sul sito della compagnia che il nostro volo è stato cancellato. Visto il periodo non stupisce, quello che invece sconvolge è che la ANZ non abbiamo ritenuto opportuno avvisarci: nessuna mail, nessun messaggio, niente. Chissà da quanto tempo il volo non era più attivo senza che noi lo sapessimo. E questo è solo l'inizio! Sul sito l'unica possibilità di "rimborso" è accettare un buono valido 12 mesi. Scriviamo piuttosto risentiti alla compagnia chiedendo il rimborso totale, ci risponde una simpatica signorina che prima ci chiede l'autorizzazione a trattare a nome di tutti i passeggeri (i passeggeri sono solo due e abbiamo firmato la mail a nome di entrambi) e successivamente ci scrive che il nostro tipo di biglietto non da diritto ad un rimborso ma solo ad un buono, che riceveremo presto. Aggiungo che il numero verde dedicato ai clienti italiani, presente sul sito della compagnia, è inesistente.

### "refusing to refund"
Tickets were purchased pre-covid to NZ for a cruise. Covid hits, borders and countries closed, flights cancelled. We all know this story. However, Air New Zealand are refusing to refund my parents money who are on a pension and have some disabilities. They have delayed, deflected, repeated and finally a 1 year credit, with "NO" agreement or consultation. How dare they refuse to refund flights they can not provide. How is it possible the Airlines can just say, no, we are keeping your money.

### "Air New Zealand reputation tarnished"
The way Air New Zealand handles th Covid-19 situation is very irresponsible. No response from them except once, regarding how much credit I have. It's been 3 weeks since my flight has been cancelled by them without warning. No notifications sent out by them when flight was cancelled. I called in twice to re-book my flight (as credit refund couldn't allow me to book online), both calls were only recording my details. 2 weeks passed, no call back or whatsoever. Customer service response rate is 0. I always fly country airline when I'm visiting the country. Right now, Air New Zealand reputation tarnished.

### "Not refunding flights"
Auckland to Papeete booked for late June. Not refunding flights. Will not be booking again with them. They should be refunding since the government gave them a loan.

### "I cannot get a refund"
I cannot get a refund for flights to Canada cancelled by Air New Zealand. Any Air NZ flight to the USA or transiting USA get refunds but this company still refuses to do the right thing by Kiwis and Australians flying to other destinations. It's immoral, unethical and corrupt. I'm down A$6200 and all I've been offered is a credit that I may never use and does not pay bills. Touching 70 years old and need my A$6,200 not a credit to become a unsecured creditor of Air NZ.

### "refused to offer a refund"
Perth to Christchurch. Disgrace - bought a business flight, Air New Zealand cancelled my flight and refused to offer a refund. I can’t use the credit in 12 months as my wife is pregnant and I wont be going on a holiday any time soon. How can you pay for a service that they don’t offer and not get a refund. Australian airlines offered refunds. Don't support Air New Zealand.

### "Don't expect a refund"
Don't expect a refund if your flight is cancelled by them!! We were booked for a 6 week trip involving 6 different airlines before Covid-19 struck. 5 of those 6 airlines provided us with a full refund when our flights were cancelled. All of them except Air New Zealand did the right thing. We were charged $500 in cancellation fees for 2 tickets that we didn't cancel - they did! When I told the customer service rep "it wasn't our fault" he simply said "it's not our fault either. How can you charge a fee for a trip you can't provide? Shame on Air New Zealand. I will never use your airline.

### "are ignoring US aviation rules"
My flights were canceled with no replacement service. I refused a credit note valid for a one off purchase valid for one year. As I was traveling for a one off event. I was told this was a very good deal by the Air NZ customer service. They owe me $2500 and are ignoring US aviation rules regarding fare refunds. If the credit had of been valued for multiple flights and with no expiry date that would have been a semi decent offer. But the fact they are legally obligated to give a full cash refund but are palming off hard working customers with a one year one off use credit note is disgusting. The amount of lost custom in the future will reverse any money they are able to keep. Jetstar on the other hand refunded canceled tickets within 14 days so I'll be using them in the future.

### "charged a cancellation fee"
Not Verified |  Beware Air New Zealand ticket scam. Customers seeking a refund are charged a cancellation fee by Air New Zealand on flights cancelled by the airline. Current rules on credits allow for only one rebooked flight per person within 12 month period, the future ticket price is not guaranteed, residual credits are lost and, no carry forward interest on prepaid flights. Do not agree to a credit for airline cancelled flights and, expect an attempt to charge fees when seeking a refund on airline cancelled flights. A prepaid ticket forms a Contact and while Air New Zealand has elected to cancel flights (thereby no longer delivering the service the customer has paid for), it demands the customer send in a cancellation notice to trigger a refund which under their code of conduct allows the airline to charge the customer a 'cancellation' fee.

### "full refund within 2 days"
For some years now Air New Zealand has been my airline of choice on my annual trip from London to Los Angeles. Towards the end of 2019 I booked a flight for September 2020 in the knowledge that they were stopping this route as of October 2020. Last week I discovered that as a result of Covid 19 they would be cancelling this route with immediate effect and not resuming it. I put in a refund request via the WhatsApp link on their web and I had a full refund within 2 days. This service equalled the great service I have always experienced on board. I will miss travelling with them.

### "I want full repayment"
London to Auckland via Los Angeles. I booked Air NZ because of a friend's recommendation. A very expensive mistake! Air NZ cancelled our flights from LHR to Auckland via LA over a month ago. However, in spite of contacting them by telephone about the cancellation and our further expenses for seat reservations, I have still have not received any refunds. They owe me almost £4500. I do not want a voucher or credit, I want full repayment. What a truly dreadful company. They are clearly operating outside of the international regulations. When the international aviation industry picks up again I will be avoiding this airline!

### "Did not get my reserved seat"
Reserved seats in May 2019 for long haul legs from Vancouver to Auckland and then return. Paid my $100.00 and travelled at the end of January 2020 and returned 3rd week of February. Did not get my reserved seat on either flight, I sat behind my reserved seat on both flights. When leaving Auckland to fly to Vancouver I asked two Air New Zealand employees about this and one said it always happens and she did not know why and the other said there is nothing she can do to help. So I reached out to Air New Zealand online when I returned. Got my $100.00 back but they did make out they were giving me something. Which they were not as it was my $100.00 that they had had for 7 months. Then I find Greg Foran`s email so went straight to the top dog of the airline. Suggested" that they could make it right to upgrade me on my next flight just as a starting point. Nope - I got an apology. First off I got brushed off and then came across the anti-gem of that airline from Customer Care - which appears to be actually careless, who stated in her last email to me was that they considered the matter closed and would not be corresponding on it any further. They have none nothing to help me out, zero, zip, not even interested to make any token offer. Shocking really. Happy to take your money but not to make small things right.

### "personally thank her on our behalf"
Not Verified |  My wife and I flew Melbourne to Auckland on March 20, flight NZ124 leaving Melbourne at approximately 2pm. The performance of the flight attendants was outstanding - polite and professional. What was more amazing was the assistance that we received from who I believe was the senior attendant on our flight as we could not find our transfer bus as we were leaving the terminal. She appeared on the scene asking if she could help. She soon had this quickly sorted and we were on our way. This was going the extra mile especially considering that she was probably off duty and going home. I cant remember her name but if possible I would like someone to personally thank her on our behalf.

### "very good for cleanness"
Not Verified |  Auckland to Melbourne. First time tried Air New Zealand. Feel it is very good for cleanness, seat comfortable, crew services are very good. Only thing is that the seat back is not adjustable.

### "very attentive flight crew"
Not Verified |  Auckland to Christchurch. Flew on this short flight on February 14th. It was a surprisingly spacious aircraft, plenty of leg room, very attentive flight crew and refreshments included. Would highly recommend.

### "not recommend flying Air NZ"
Auckland to Houston. Flew for business travel... never again! I had a huge issue checking bag when I checked in at kiosk. They take advantage of passport holders outside of the US by making you follow all the prompts and swiping your card to check a bag and charging you $100 USD then the kiosk says to see customer service to get documents printed where they charge you AGAIN for the same bag. They don’t give you a receipt for the kiosk charge just the desk charge and when asked why the double charge customer care said sorry too bad and told me to deal with it. Really sneaky way to steal from customers by prompting them to the payment screen on kiosk and once card is swiped saying error please get documents from agent where they then charge you again. Would not recommend flying Air NZ.

### "cancelled and rebooked 3 times"
Nelson to Niue via Auckland. Flights cancelled and rebooked 3 times. Air NZ reluctantly provided only 1 night accomodation, referring to their Weather Disruption Policy. Waiting for the rebooked flights, I spent more money on hotels in Auckland airport then on the ticket itself. In the end had to cancel the whole trip anyway. Air NZ show very little understanding for their customers.

### "not enough drinks supplied"
Buenos Aires to Auckland. The aircraft was old and not comfortable, we’re supposed to fly new B787 but problems with them. Total of 25 hours due to passenger being taken I’ll on first flight over Pacific and having to go back to Chile and eventually back to Buenos Aires. Following morning set off at 3am again to get to airport and start flight again. Service was pretty bad on both flights, certainly not enough drinks supplied and the food was disgusting, giving us identical meal choices on both flights. We lost a day and a half in Auckland of a two day stop over .

### "Worst airline ever"
Niue to Auckland. Worst airline ever. If had other would choose but only serviced by them. Cancelled flight twice, no compo ended up extra week in NZ at huge cost. So  unhelpful on phone for over hour with customer service even regulate to manager who was just as useless. We will contact you with update. Yet I had to remind them they need my contact details while here.

### "Thanks for absolutely nothing"
Auckland to Niue. Our plane is delayed for two days, and we have to find last minute family accommodation (two adults and infant). Air new Zealand did nothing to assist, and would not cover any cost. We are a young Australian family, stranded in NZ, waiting for our flight, now out of pocket several hundred dollars, as well as loosing our accommodation in niue. Thanks for absolutely nothing Air new Zealand

### "poor customer service"
Los Angeles to Auckland. I had reserved this flight with point. After completing the booking I was offered to pick my seat by Air New Zealand for an extra fee which I did. On the day of travel I was informed by Air New Zealand staff that due to unforeseen circumstances the seat that I had picked and paid extra for was not available and I was issued a different seat. The staff said there was a few travelers in my situation and they would issue a refund. Ok I get it things happen. But I paid for this seat. If you are going to take it away from me, refund the money. Don't just steal from me. They did not refund me as stated at the ticket counter. I am trying to get a refund but with a poor customer service department (website) it is very frustrating.

### "disappointed in this lack of service"
Not Verified |  Auckland to Christchurch. When arriving at Auckland Airport. We recieved unacceptable customer service at the special assistance counter. We have a son in a wheelchair so need the wheelchair to be taken to the flight door. As our son is able to walk limited steps when required. We were told it was a full flight by the air NZ team member. And we had not let them know by email pre flight. And all seats are pre allocated. So she can't just change seats because of us. I explained to her that we have traveled a lot and have never come across this problem. As it is always done through the hospital travel centre. ( And when back in Christchurch   I rang our agent to confirm this was correct. And she confirmed that they always email the wheelchair weight etc details. ) I asked her if I could maybe have someone else who understood our situation could help us. And she said she would get her supervisor to explain to us. Upon return she said we will do it for today? When reaching the the flight gate we were asked if we had been to special assistance. As they had been informed of us needing assistance? The team member Ash at gate 29 was amazing and even walked as to the flight door. When on our flight we were surprised to find it was not a full flight and there about 50+ empty seats. I'm very disappointed in this lack of service at the beginning of our check in process.

### "none of the flight attendants cared"
Los Angeles to Auckland. Our trouble first started at LAX when we had received our confirmation email and tickets we noticed that my husband and I had not been seated next to each other, but they told us (in the email) that if we paid an extra 100 dollars each we could pick seats next to each other. So when we arrived at LAX via SeaTac we went to look for a customer service agent. There were no customer service agents so we tried to talk to someone at the gate of a flight leaving earlier than ours. We also tried to ask if there was any room on the earlier flight because we’ve been moved multiple times to earlier same day flights by QANTAS for more convenience. The woman said “if you wanted to change your flight you should have contacted reservations via phone” and then immediately looked behind us and yelled “NEXT” without us even saying another word. So we waited for someone to come to our gate and when they finally arrived we walked up to change our seats. He called someone via phone to change our seats and then said “yeah for some reason they want to sit next to each other” very rudely. Believe it or not I would like to sit next to my husband on a 13 hour flight. He then proceeded to scan our passports (our final destination was Australia where my husband is from) and told me my visa to Australia had been denied. I told him I had a confirmation email that it was approved and gave him the confirmation number. He proceeded to call Australian immigration to figure out what was going on. After he had scanned my passport the first time my husband walked around the desk so he could see the computer screen. The man proceeded to scan my passport at least 15 more times and told me it showed up denied every time, but my husband could see the computer was popping up that my visas were approved. He took thirty minutes to call immigration and finally tell me nothing was wrong with my visa. While we were on the flight you could tell none of the flight attendants cared about anyone on the flight. One of them spilled orange juice all over my husband, he shrugged and then walked off without an apology or giving us a napkin to clean up. Later one of the flight attendants slapped my leg as they walked past for no apparent reason. Lastly I went to the bathroom and as I got out and started walking back to my seat I noticed one of the attendants walking down the same aisle so I started to back up towards the bathroom so he could go by rather than trying to shuffle past each other and as he got closer to me he made a shooing motion and said “GO, GO” and then sat in the back to gossip with all the other flight attendants that were sitting back there. I emailed customer service about all of this and was told I would be contacted in 15-20 days and it has now been almost 4 weeks since I submitted my complaint. This was our first time flying with Air New Zealand and it will be our last, we will continue flying with QANTAS.

### "worked without a shred of enthusiasm"
Perth to Auckland. Air New Zealand managed to negatively impact our holiday plans and those of 14,000 others before we even left home by withdrawing their Dreamliners from service due to maintenance issues. Thus there were no direct flights from Perth to Christchurch and that direct flight was the only reason we had originally booked Air NZ. This was an immediate fail as re-scheduling had to occur which added some 10 hours unnecessary travelling time and inconvenience to our holiday by having to fly to Auckland and then domestically to Christchurch and return. As to the Perth to Auckland overnight flight the comfort of premium economy on the 777 was fine. We had an ok dinner meal, nothing amazing, but were supposed to have some refresher food prior to landing or so the menu said however that simply didn't eventuate. No explanation was given. Nice cost saving there Air NZ. The crew were efficient but worked without a shred of enthusiasm, one would expect far better in premium class. The flight was on-time. We would be unlikely to fly Air New Zealand again.

### "total disappointment"
Not Verified |  
Brisbane to Auckland. Once again a total disappointment from the lack of care to the second rate seats. The staff are rude and unprofessional drinking a can of coke as they welcome you on board to the lack of smiles. The total lack of please and thank you. The sign to stop evoucher customers in to the forum lounge was the icing on the cake. All I can say is hopeless.

### "Truly disappointing"
Not Verified |  Singapore to Auckland on 26th Dec. My Wife requested on the screen for a set of toothbrush, waited for more than 10 minutes. After which, she called for the flight attendant. Within 10s, staff shoved the set of toothbrush from the back in a rude manner without saying a word. On our return flight from Auckland, it was the same FA again who rudely walk past my Wife holding onto a jug of water and ignored her request for it. Then there was another FA who gave everybody in front, behind and beside us ice-cream but chose to ignore us. And when I called for the flight attendant on the screen, it was ignored as well. We waited for another good half an hr before another flight attendant came on with a basket of leftovers asking people for a second serving, then we received our ice creams. I seriously do not understand how such service would justify for a Best Airline award. This would be the first and last time that I would take Air New Zealand. Truly disappointing!

### "cannot speak highly enough"
Not Verified |  The experience from Norfolk Island to Sydney was amazing. Ground crew at both ends made my day travelling with my 90 year old aunt so easy. I cannot speak highly enough. Thanks to all concerned.

### "Disappointing change for the worst"
Brisbane to Auckland. Disappointing change for the worst. The decision to change marketing of your seats/tickets on the basis of seat cost and separate extra charges for food, drinks, and entertainment is appalling. Only the discount airlines such as Jetstar and virgin employ this type of ticketing and are transparent about it. Obviously, Air New Zealand has lost its image as a premium airline to resort to this type of non transparent marketing. This situation was highlighted when we travelled over Christmas 2019, when four of our Family members visited Australia. We were very disappointed with the flight and service. We were not made aware of the extras required when booking our flights and therefore had no food, drinks and entertainment as expected. After paying $700 plus each we expected full service, not just a seat. On his separate return flight to NZ, my Brother experienced a terrible and uncomfortable flight with no cabin air conditioning. When he asked flight staff about the situation, they were uncaring and unfriendly. The baggage check in policy has also changed, and is so unfair, as each passenger is allowed 1x23kg bag. Two of us had one (1) bag each and my 9 year old Daughter had two (2) small bags with a combined weight of 17kg - well below the allowable 23kg. Total combined weight of all check in baggage was 64kg - below the allowable 69kg. No consideration or attempt was made to assist only a demand to pay a $160 fee. Air New Zealand staff Immediately demanded payment of $160 for this situation, and then an additional $160 as one of the other bags was 1.6kg overweight. Your staff were unfriendly, arrogant, and not prepared to offer any solution until one of the  male staff members came to our rescue and was willing to help with our problem. Other reputable airlines do not treat check in baggage in this way. They are prepared to look at the situation make allowances using combined weight if there is a problem. Based on our experience, we will fly Qantas in future, not Air New Zealand. We have used the discount airlines such as Jetstar and Virgin Pacific in the past and had a far better experience and paid a lot less for the flight.

### "they do need to fine tune the minor details"
Auckland to Wellington. My first domestic flight in New Zealand and so far so good. Check in was done online and all I had to do was go through security after getting my physical boarding pass in the terminal. After a mediocre lounge visit, boarding was on time with followed my departure. The cabin crew were super friendly, with lots of smiles. The cabin needed further cleaning as I spotted crumbs on seats during boarding. Catering were cheese and crackers including a choice of beverage, nothing to elaborate on. The biggest downfall in my opinion was not having headphones for the IFE, I guess you can't win everything. Overall, it was a decent offering from Air NZ but I think they do need to fine tune the minor details that can make a good flight, great.

### "never be flying them again"
Not Verified |  Christchurch to Brisbane. Paid over $700 for a ticket, didnt get an option for a drink other than a water or coffee, didn't even come with an inflight meal for a 5 hour flight and again let me stress this .. a $700 ticket! Service was terrible, the attendants didn't seem to want to be there or a give a dam about any of the customers on the plane. I will never be flying them again.

### "rude, tired, disrespectful and cold"
Brisbane to San Francisco via Auckland. Having chosen ANZ as my carrier of choice for many years sadly I won’t ever again. Having bid for an upgrade to Skycouch and told my $$$ bid success rate was excellent, then at the last minute being told I was unsuccessful myself and my wife and 14 month were somewhat disappointed. However we understood. The flight was to quote the Auckland rep “totally Chocka” and therefore he couldn’t sit us together. Fair enough. I am in seat 58k my wife with the bassinet is in 30 something. Do you think anyone was interested in helping us juggle a baby, eating and sleeping? No! The staff onboard (bar one) were rude, tired, disrespectful and cold. Being in your company for 12 hours I want to feel welcome. Me and my Family didn’t. We felt like an unwanted nuisance. For this reason no more money to ANZ.

### "the flight was cancelled"
Queenstown to Auckland. As Canadian tourists we have had a number of Air New Zealand flights both international and domestic and until recently were pleased with the service. However, on Dec. 7 flooding blocked the bridges and we were unable to get to Christchurch for a flight to Auckland. We then booked a flight from Queenstown to Auckland for Dec 8. We received an email in the morning on Dec 8 that our flight was cancelled because of "operational requirements". We were able to book a flight for Dec 9 but went to the Airport that morning explore whether there were any flight options for Dec 8. We were told by Air New Zealand officials that the flight was cancelled due to weather. Surprisingly no other Air New Zealand flights from Queenstown were cancelled that day. We were also told by the Air NZ official that the outage would have meant that the incoming flight we would have taken would have been delayed by 3 hours and was subsequently cancelled. We have since been trying to get some compensation from Air NZ on the basis that: the passengers on our flight (NZ 622) were discriminated against in that the flight was cancelled rather than simply delayed; that the cancellation was the result of the lack of an appropriate contingency plan; and that we would have been happy with a 3 hour delay which would not have resulted in significant incremental costs to us (additional hotel night, additional car rental, meals etc). Air New Zealand has rejected our appeal and denied our request to provide us with the name and email address of a government agency regulating the air industry to which we would be able to complain.

### "The worst crew service"
Taipei to Christchurch via Auckland. The worst crew service I have seen. The cabin staff seemed to be completely untrained. Impolite treatment of guests, there is no right to choose the food you like. To reduce costs by sacrificing guests' rights, Not worthy to take this airline.

### "their service has slipped"
Sydney to Auckland. My ticket was for The works. The meals options were lamb, chicken and pasta. This aircraft was quite small but they ran out of lamb. Flight attendants forgot to hand out food to couple of passengers after asking them what option they would like. Food was served 45 minutes for landing. Also, when a senior gentleman asked for a blanket, flight attendant bluntly said I dont know where it is stored. After 30 minutes she came with a blanket. I always fly with Air \new Zealand but recently their service has slipped.

### "We recommend this airline"
Auckland to Christchurch. When we arrived in Bangkok I realized I got confused and booked our flight a day to early, it was leaving Auckland while we were still in Bangkok. I contacted Air New Zealand through messenger, they immediately rebooked our flights same flight times different day. I am so grateful for this. It was so great to arrive and just board. We recommend this airline with a warm heart.

### "Truly slipping standards"
Brisbane to Auckland. Truly slipping standards. As a kiwi I would love to give a score of 10/10 but I cant go above 1. Poor boarding processes on single aisle plane led to delays. IFE buggy and restarted multiple times. Cabin feels cramped and not enough baggage space. Crew uninterested and slow. Good luck trying to use the toilet for 90 mins around dinner! Dinner itself was below even a normal flight standard. On the plus side the plane is amazingly quiet and the pilots alerted of bumps/turbulence well in advance.

### "deal with poor service"
I booked my flight from Auckland to Queenstown (9:30 flight) only to wake up to a text message that says your flight is cancelled. The text said to wait 15 min and they will rebook your flight I waited and nothing. I called the line they provided and while I was on the line waiting for 30 min, somehow my friend managed to get on the phone with someone in less than 5 min and got the next flight out at 10:50 For me, I stayed on the phone waiting for 45 min only to find out the 10:50 flight was full and the next flight out was at 5:30. I managed to get a flight to Wellington at 12:10 then a connecting flight at 1:50. Well my first flight was delayed by 20 min and I managed to barely make my connecting flight. The staff at the connecting flight were rude Even though I explained the situation. Before take off I needed to use the restroom ( we haven’t even left, the airfare was still connected ) she let out a huge sigh and told me to hurry up. Then before we landed she wanted me to reach over the 2 passages to open the window ( I had the aisle seat ) and when I asked her you want me to reach over these sleeping people to open the window? She let out another sigh again and told me the same thing. Not only my flight was cancelled and I had to scramble to get the next flight I had to deal with poor service. Won’t be flying with this airline again.

### "Bad frustrating service"
Not Verified | Christchurch to Queenstown. Got here ok but was given wrong/information by Air Nz staff to catch my flight and missed this while looking for the gate. I’m Koru never as well. Bad frustrating service

### "My seat was uncomfortable"
Los Angeles to Auckland. I haven't flown Air New Zealand since 2011, and I was looking forward to using them again. I had only ever had good experiences with this airline, and expected no different this time. Perhaps I was spoiled the last time I few to NZ because I traveled on American Airlines' B787, and it was a pleasant experience. But then, I have also traveled on Air New Zealand's 777 before, and enjoyed that, so I really don't know what has changed. However, the fact is, my well-seasoned (25+ years) rolling carry on would not fit down the aisle once I got to steerage, and I was forced to turn it sideways and lift it. It wasn't that I couldn't make it fit, but I had to slightly angle it each time I went past a seat. This probably should have been a warning sign! My seat was uncomfortable. So uncomfortable, in fact, that my left buttock became positively painful. Not sore, painful. It felt like I was sitting on some kind of ridge. The seat was hard, and I suffered cramps for 24 hours after landing as a result. Although I was lucky enough to have a free seat next to me (the plane was full), the shape of the seats made it such that it really wasn't the benefit that perhaps it could have been. Now, the cabin crew was good, and I'm not faulting the service, although it would have been nice if water could have been brought around more than once. The entertainment was fine, and I loved the free wifi, USB port and socket for every seat. The temperature seemed to vary a lot from cold to very warm, and the air was dry (I am comparing it to the 787 here, it's true). But, it was just so very uncomfortable that I cannot see myself using ANZ again. I had considered bidding on an upgrade, but I missed the deadline. When I walked past business class and saw the pods, I was glad I had missed it. They looked really small, cramped, and "open". However, as I have never actually flown business class (in 55 years of flying), I can only comment on my perception here. So, in short, I could have paid $250 more for American Airlines and had a much more comfortable trip, along with an extra bag. It's what I'll do next time.

### "never recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Auckland to Rotorua. Flight cancelled. Confusion at check-in desk ,finally solved into a minibus with trailer for suitcases. The worst bus ride I have had in my life 3 hours of bouncing. No alternative offered and no compensation. Arrived at destination with the contents of my suitcase wet from continual rain all the way to destination. Would never recommend this airline.

### "yet again cancelled a flight"
Auckland to Palmerston North. 0/10 rating as anger doesn't sum up how I was left feeling when Air NZ yet again cancelled a flight with no alternative than to stay in Auckland over night and arrive home at 4pm due to no other available flights. Guess stuff the passengers who have commitments and no one to assist. How about they put their profits back into the company and update the national fleet as frequent cancelled flights due to engineering problems is a joke. I managed to book Air Chathams 5 mins before they departed as I needed to get home. No problem, amazing pilot and staff. Air NZ you could do with learning customer service from them, the good old kiwi way!

### "I was selected to be downgraded"
Not Verified |  Auckland to San Francisco. I was told at boarding that there was a change from the 777 300 to the 777 200 so my paid Business 3A seat was cancelled and I was now in premium economy. I was not told why I was selected to be downgraded. I had no choice but to board or to offload. Premium economy passengers were moved to economy for several business passengers to go to premium economy. If I’m in seat 3A and the plane holds less passengers in business, then shouldn’t those in now non-existing seats be moved? Someone else was sitting in my 3A business class seat. So upset. There was no warning or notice as this was done just at boarding even though they knew this was an issue for hours. Some people didn’t fly at all. I feel sorry for those who are on the return flight who will suffer the same shock. Bad bad bad air NZ!

### "not many alternatives"
Auckland to Adelaide. Full flight in economy and premium economy, but Business had a few empty seats. Staff in business class was attentive and friendlyt. Service level is usually not the problem with Air NZ. The business class seat is still probably one of the worst hardware in the industry for its price. Facing away from the window, seat is harder than most of the business seats, also the seat is not spacious enough, i am 185cm tall and i was unable to fully stretch my legs. The entertainment system and hardware is showing a bit of age, as most other airlines are starting to have similar size screens for premium economy and economy sometimes. Also i dont understand why did Air NZ install the screen on the side of the seat, which means the passenger cant really watch the screen during take off and landing? Food was ok, nothing to be excited about. Guess i would still recommend because there are not many alternatives.

### "Very good service"
Not Verified |  Very good service. Had 3 fights in September - October, Gold Coast to Christchurch. Disappointed that Sunday fight has been now discontinued. Gold Coast to Christchurch arrive too late. Bring back a more realistic time schedule.

### "I appreciate your care"
Not Verified |  I want to record my thanks and appreciation to the pilot of NZ5123 Auckland to Palmerston North, Thursday 17 Oct 2019 and the two hostesses on duty. Our flight was approx. 30 mins into the journey and returned to AKL, the engineers verified the plane was grounded and we disembarked into the terminal. Despite the disruption and waiting time, a replacement aircraft was located and we reboarded to learn that the two hostesses had agreed to complete their journey with us and spend an unplanned overnight stay in Palmerston North. On arrival the pilot alighted firstly and stood to greet us all on the ground. I appreciate your care in keeping us safe, thank you.

### "a long but enjoyable trip"
Los Angeles to Melbourne via Auckland. My wife and I were travelling to attend a medical science conference from Toronto and we chose to travel with Air New Zealand because of reasonably good reviews and some feedback from friends. This was the first time we have travelled in Air New Zealand. I was very impressed by the service and the quality of the aircraft. It is understood that the economy seats would be not as comfortable as premium economy or business class as in any airline, but they were acceptable. Each seat has a power outlet which allowed me to do some work during the long flight. The entertainment was good and the screens were good quality. The availability of free wifi through the long flight was a bonus and appreciated. The food was of good quality. The flight attendants were friendly and appeared to enjoy their work and were genuine in their interactions. I was very impressed by Air New Zealand, and I will certainly fly again. Thank you for a long but enjoyable trip.

### "We were very disappointed"
Los Angeles to Auckland. We travel every year from Auckland to Heathrow return in business class . We stopped using Air New Zealand about 6 years ago due to consistently poor service. In October we decided to book an Air New Zealand flight to see if anything had improved and if they were a viable option for our next trip. We were very disappointed. We flew from Los Angeles to Auckland in a Boeing 777 that had been converted to very cramped herring bone style seats that could be laid flat by the staff but not by the passenger. We were unable to sit together due to the sardine like layout. The few staff were brusque and in fact downright rude. My request for a soft drink and later coffee were denied by angry staff who said they only wanted the meal order . The "supper service" was rushed and the food very average. Not enough water and drinks were available throughout the flight. After the supper service the staff vanished until the breakfast service just before landing. There was one toilet available for a whole cabin full of business passengers. There was nothing "business premium" about the accommodation or the service. I have had more comfortable Economy flights. Feedback has been given via the Air NZ website but there has been no response.

### "the most unpleasant experience"
Flying with Air New Zealand was the most unpleasant experience that I've ever had with an airline in my many years of travel. I chose to pay much more for a flight to have it direct from Sydney to Rarotonga as I'm pregnant and I want to spend as little time as possible flying. The first flight from Brisbane to Sydney was delayed and it resulted in me losing the next flight from Sydney to Rarotonga. At Sydney airport the staff were very poor in their communication and were completely unwilling to address our dissatisfaction and dismissed us by saying hat they can't do anything about it. They paid for a cheap hotel overnight and said that the food and transport from the airport was on me and would not fund this. They changed my route for the next day from Sydney to aUCKLAND  and then Rarotonga. This was all beyond my control. I paid a high price for the best direct route and now had to travelled from the worst as they didn't give any other option. I tried to talk to 3 different people from Air New Zealand and the only thing they said is that they can't do anything about it because delays happen. Interesting is that when it is in the other foot there is no way to answer the same way right? If we need to change a flight after one day of the purchase we already have to pay a crazy fee, we can never be late, we can never complain about anything. If Air New Zealand wanted at least to try to be decent with their clients knowing that situation etc the minimum they could do is to offer a upgrade in the flight (as I was utterly exhausted, already lost $1000 in one night's accommodation in the Cook Islands, one whole day of my holiday, car transfer, food, shuttle etc) but not even that. This is disgusting and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone. I will never fly air new Zealand again. I could not be more frustrated. How can a company be so dismissive of a customer that has a genuine complaint and has every right to be upset.

### "embarrassment to New Zealand"
Palmerston North to Wellington. How this awful airline continues to win awards is beyond me! The check in staff are a extremely lacking any form of professionalism or intelligence. The staff onboard are as dated as the aircraft itself which is often dirty and unkept. They give out plastic cups which they fill with $1 bottles of water for goodness sake! Even EasyJet isn’t stooping that low. The airfares are overpriced and the routes are lacking. Overall one of the worse airlines I’ve had the misfortune of using. Absolutely an embarrassment to New Zealand and I feel very sorry for the locals who are forced to use the airline as it’s the only one they have

### "lack of allergy-friendly food"
Auckland to Sydney. My review is about their food service, While booking the flight I looked at their ‘special meals’ as I have an allergy to nuts however found that there is no option for a non-tree nut meal however they said no peanuts are used. While onboard my flight when the food came around I then asked the flight attendant which meal had nuts in it I was then replied with an “I don’t know” I then said I had a nut allergy and she again asked me which meal I wanted without giving me any insight to the ingredients of these meals. I am disappointed and shocked by the lack of concern by the flight attendant as my nut allergy leads to me going into anaphylaxis and the lack of allergy-friendly food options as I was also told by the flight attendant around 5 other people asked about the use of nuts in their food. The website leaves a large grey area of whether or not the food is safe for people with allergies as when it says peanut friendly they leave out all of the tree nuts used. Because I paid for “The Works” under the impression the meals were allergy-friendly I am disappointed in the customer service and lack of knowledge received by the flight attendants.

### "food and service were horrible"
Not Verified |  Hong Kong to Auckland. Horrible crew. Hostile and not accomodating. The crew took long time to bring water more than 15 minutes. I told them the family and children behind me was kicking me and bang my head. The chief of the crew said he can't do anything. He went on to say since I am not happy asked me not to fly with Air New Zealand. He was unsympathetic and double standard. He changed the seat of the girl seated by the window as he said she couldn't sleep due to me. The food and service were horrible.

### "Really disappointed"
Auckland to Wellington. Really disappointed with Air New Zealand. They charge significantly more than Jetstar and position themselves as having better service and reliability. But fail on both counts. Main issues I’ve had are: Refusing to let me check in ahead of time (without giving an explanation), Forcing high transfer fees even in exceptional circumstances (public health Emergency). You can’t act like a cheap airline and charge like a first class one.

### "they seem to disappoint continuously now"
I’m ready to be done with Air New Zealand. I fly a lot and they seem to disappoint continuously now. Last month they cancelled my Hong Kong flight when other airlines were flying no problem and they don’t answer the phone number they provide to provide any limited help in sorting out new flights. Today I’m flying to Chicago and stuck in the last row seats that don’t recline for 15 hours. Those seats should not be sold because of the extreme discomfort for such long periods. Every Air NZ worker I spoke to (3) agreed the seats don’t recline. Agreed I won’t be able to watch TV because the person in front will be too close and the result? Told it is too bad by all 3. Sick of the poor service and no personal care. Sick of trying to support my national airline and getting stuck with cancelled flights, extra fees, and useless help. Rather spend more money and fly a better airline like Singapore Airlines from now on.

### "same as low cost budget airlines"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Auckland. Paid $610 return for flight with air NZ on seat and bag , compared on the same route and date to Jetstar price was cheaper at $499 seat and bag, Qantas $545 and virgin Australia $550 seat bag plus free meal and entertainment. Flight was delayed over 1 hour, no food or drinks to compensate for delay. Movie cost extra $10 for old releases. This is the third time this year I flew with Air New Zealand  and all out of three were delayed. This airline is now on the same row as low cost budget airlines like Jetstar or Tigerair.

### "leather seats were nice"
Not Verified | Gold Coast to Christchurch. Amazing IFE, so new and fresh. Plush leather seats were nice. Wifi Connectivity was great on this flight. Hopefully, more aircraft have wifi like this. The Cabin crew were nice, pilots were really nice and let me look around the cockpit.

### "Great Cabin service"
Christchurch to Gold Coast. Great airline. Great cabin service. Could do with a bit newer IFE but otherwise amazing. Cabin crew were nice, very chatty, You could get a good meal for the price you paid.

### "Seats were adequate"
Not Verified |  Rotorua to Wellington. Staff service was efficient and friendly. Seats were adequate, not much legroom width. Nice cookie time cookie and cup of coffee. Great service with wheelchair assist.

### "Staff on the flights were fantastic"
Not Verified |  I booked flights for my family on this route. We had a further connection from Chicago to Akron. The woman at the desk at the Gold Coast was so helpful and friendly in getting us sorted and informed on how to get our bags all the way to Akron (we had to recheck them when we landed in Chicago, which we weren't told by our booking agent). Staff on the flights, particularly the long haul from Auckland to Chicago, were fantastic. They did everything to be of assistance to us - my wife is pregnant and we were traveling with our 6 month old too.

### "Very poor service"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Queenstown. Very poor service. Poor self management experience online. Trying to change my ticket on the phone but waited>15 minutes with no response. At the Melbourne airport service said you must call them as we cannot make changes to your ticket. At the end they checked us in all over the aircraft instead of being together. No leg room for tall person. Unfriendly aircrew

### "disorganised, terrible communication"
Brisbane to Auckland. Flight yesterday was canceled after 4 hours took staff to organise accommodation another 3 hours - disorganised, terrible communication and inexperienced. Tried to Cancel accomodation in Auckland, Could Not as too late. Following day new flight - check was nightmare staff hopeless stood around none understood what delays were - told we were on stand bye as not enough seat on plane. Finally got checked in again through customs for 2nd time - flight delayed again this time a further 2 hours.

### "cabin was well set out"
Hong Kong to Auckland. Premium Economy was exactly what it said and more. The separate cabin was well set out, leg rests were adjustable and allowed almost complete lieback. There was plenty of leg room between the seats . The staff were attentive. An icon on the screen allowed one to call a staff member at any time. Extra drinks were available. The on-screen entertainment was varied and meals were excellent. For breakfast before landing we were offered fruit salad and cereals plus youghurt, crackers and cheese, and a main course. I chose the omelette with potatoes and mushrooms and tomato. I could not fault any of the service from ground staff through to airline staff.

### "a very stressful trip"
Due to issues with the plane coming from Auckland to Adelaide our flight to Auckland was delayed by several hours thus making it impossible for us to make the connecting Air New Zealand flight to San Francisco. Air New Zealand decided to reassign us to the flight going to LAX (really dislike this airport) instead and put us on a domestic flight in the US to San Francisco. The whole point of us flying Air NZ was because of the direct international flight from Adelaide and getting us to our preferred destination of San Francisco. Our arrival in San Francisco was 5 hours later than expected so we were not able to do anything other than have dinner in our hotel and go to bed as had early morning flight next day of which Air New Zealand were aware. Contacted the airline re compensation of some kind eg an upgrade on return flight but was advised it is not their policy to do this as essentially they had got us to our destination. We did get offered the use of their airport lounge in Auckland on the return trip. It was a very stressful trip over as by time we got through immigration, customs and domestic security in LA we nearly missed the domestic flight (they were closing the gates). Overall every Air New Zealand flight we took was delayed by at least an hour. The on board entertainment was very poor, all old movies. On our flight home from Houston to Auckland (premium economy) one of our screens was not working and could not be fixed so we had to share. Best thing we watched was the online safety message. Food ok but really nothing special.

### "Was less than happy"
Melbourne to Queenstown. Initially the staff I dealt with over the phone and in the airport were great, how ever my flight to Queenstown was cancelled, which I was not alerted about via email or text. The group I was travelling with (4 adults and a child) were put on a flight to Sydney (from Adelaide) then to Queenstown the same day, I therefore called Air New Zealand to try to arrange this flight to Sydney in which I was told it was impossible and unlikely they were on this flight as it was with Jetstar, needless to say I didn’t get to Queenstown until the following day which resulted in my lateness for wedding preparations. After this I still had no notifications of my further flights to Queenstown but had to call again late at night to find this information. Was less than happy with the communication from the cancellation to the rebooking of the flight.

### "Luckily was upgraded"
Auckland to Nuku'alofa. Luckily was upgraded just before boarding. Standard of flight attendants and IFE amazing. Lie-flat function of seat fantastic, only good for sleeping on back, not sideways. Really love the big table, gave me impression. Wine selection was better than the food surprisingly.

### "lack of customer service"
I had to fly from Auckland to Nelson following surgery to my knee. My surgeon had faxed through documents stating that I would need a wheelchair for both getting to the plane in Auckland and getting off the plane in Nelson. I scanned my boarding pass along with my support person's and was assuming that they would have a system in place where it would show an alert to me needing assistance (wheelchair). It did not. My support person spoke to the Air New Zealand staff member regarding use of a wheelchair. She said it's only a short walk (to plane)and left it at that. There was absolutely no pleasantries from her at all. We walked out to the plane (past about 8 wheelchairs!) Which for someone newly on crutches was a long way. We were baffled by her actions and lack of customer service. Getting off the plane in Nelson was the total opposite. A wheelchair was waiting for me at the bottom of the ramp and she pushed me all the way out to the carpark. Guess maybe Auckland lady was having a rough day? Or she is just an awful uncaring person? It's a shame that one person's actions can have such a negative impact.

### "Poor service on this flight"
Singapore to Auckland on the 787-9. Poor service on this flight. Flight attendants look like they are about to retire and do not represent NZ at all, no style at all. Very dirty plane, air vents haven't been cleaned in ages, see photos. Lights had dirt around them. The window hasn't been cleaned, oily film from someone's hair. USB charging stopped mid-flight. Flight attendants unprofessional and unqualified like others have mentioned. The flight attendants were rude and asked 3 times what I wanted without giving me a chance to respond, gave us an ice cream tub without a spoon? This Airline is nowhere near the quality of Singapore Airlines, Qatar, Emirates. I can safely say I had better service on Jetstar for crying out loud. Meals were substandard similar to southern China airlines plastic cutlery and tasteless food no seasoning at all, however, China Southern is extremely cheap, Air NZ is so overpriced. The seat was uncomfortable not enough lateral thigh support. The Dreamliner is a joke, the 777, A330, 350 and 380 are far more comfortable planes. A huge difference between Singapore and Air NZ. Singapore ran a drink service every 45 minutes and snacks every other hour. Air NZ, on the other hand, comes every 1.5 hours with plastic cups in one hand and a jug in the other, can tell they are cutting costs. Unfortunately, they codeshare with Singapore however if AIR NZ is offered again on my itinerary I will avoid which means avoiding Singapore Airlines which is Number 1 if it means I have to stay 15 hours for a Singapore flight I would take that any day over Air NZ. Even Qantas, Sri Lankan, and Malaysian Airlines are above Air NZ. The menu, for instance, is announced over the PA no paper menu and no time to hand out hot towels and to think they charge more than their competitors? Inflight entertainment is average route map is very basic. No WIFI. Nothing to recommend here.

### "Super comfortable seat"
Los Angeles to London. The best airline I've flown. Super comfortable seat, and I'm 6'2. Best food I've had on a plan.. Free, fast wifi- I could watch Netflix. IFE was pretty good. Crew could've been a bit more friendly. .

### "very professional and friendly"
Return flight with our proud flag national airline, beautiful all black silver fern aircraft. Clean and tidy. Flight attendants are very professional and friendly. Departed on time and landed a bit early for both legs. Pilot was able to broadcast a lot of information while in the air to keep us informed such as where we were, what's under and what is the height and temperature et.. Short haul flight with beverage provided, classic cookie time and a cup of hot tea/coffee to keep us warm. Overall perfect.

### "nightmare like flying experience"
Tokyo Narita to Auckland. It was the worst nightmare like flying experience ever because of one unqualified and unprofessional flight attendant. My seat was in the first front row where it was closest to the exit and the cabin crew worked. One of flight attendants had kept making offensive comments about passengers from a certain country. She said that passangers from this country  should not be seated in front because they were rude and not smiley. I was Asian looking, not the race she emphasized, but it made me sick and angry. She never stopped complaining until landed and it ruined all the moments that I had wished.

### "a fantastic experience "
I had a fantastic experience with Air New Zealand, flying from Los Angeles to London and back a week later. I needed special assistance with a wheelchair and right from Check-In Air NZ was on top of it. Assistance was provided directly at Check-In, I was brought to the Business Class Lounge and picked up on time before boarding the plane. Bonny C. from Customer Relations took exceptional care of me, made me feel welcomed and made sure I had everything I needed. Bonny even went out of her way and got me a Fast-Pass for my connecting flight in London because my layover was gonna be really short and Heathrow airport is gigantic. In fact - without Bonny's foresight regarding my short layover I would have missed my connection. The flight to London and back was very pleasant. The crew on both flights was incredibly attentive, upbeat, friendly and professional. The food was very good. The plane was nice and clean. I very much appreciated the great service and would fly Air New Zealand anytime again.

### "probably avoid business class"
I usually fly Cathay Pacific business across the Pacific so have a point of comparison. Also, I am not a frequent flyer or getting a company trip so pay for the flights myself. Therefore, I expect good quality and service. My flights from Perth to Auckland return (8 hrs): the flight attendants were fabulous, friendly and very attentive. The food was good. The crews' names were offered and the head steward came by to greet us at the outset and thank us at the end of the flight. 2My flights from Houston to Auckland return (13.5 hours): Complete opposite to the Perth-Auckland flights. On both long haul flights the flight attendants were borderline rude and not attentive. Never once got a smile from the female attendant on my Houston-Auckland flight. And, to make matters worse, the food was very poor. The differences between the crews Perth-Auckland vs Auckland-Houston: young and fresh; old and jaded (and I am an older person so it is not an ageist comment). I don't care whether you are at the end of your career, being personable, warm and friendly go a long way. Another annoyance is that the chairs do not convert into a full bed, but need to be constructed by the attendants by lying down a separate mattress. You can NOT comfortable lying down when the beds are not made up as your legs are dangling in midair. There was also subtle pressure both to get the beds arranged and disassembled for the sleep time. The Auckland airport lounge is also very poor: crowded with mediocre food. Cathay Pacific has a lot to show Air New Zealand. Yeah, Air NZ was a bit cheaper, but will probably avoid business class on this airline in the future.

### "trip thoroughly enjoyable"
Not Verified |  Flight Attendants made my trip thoroughly enjoyable. They greeted me by name and I was attended to well. The inflight meal was just the right size and very tasty. Was asked frequently if I wanted a drink, and water was available at short notice. I was able to spread myself across part of the seat beside me as well, which was great, as my original seat had three of us side by side in an exit row. I was moved back one row. The plane was delayed for a little while as we had delayed connecting flight passengers to wait for. We arrived in Perth a little late, but had made up some time during the flight. The cabin staff were all friendly, well presented and happy to assist. This was my first overseas flight for 28 years and I enjoyed the flight immensely.

### "better experience than economy"
Napier to San Francisco via Auckland. Efficient check-in at Napier with baggage checked in all the way through to SFO. Smooth uneventful flight with usual water, cookie and coffee to AKL, with an effortless breeze through immigration and security at AKL. Koru lounge served its purpose, though I have always found it fairly souls. Views over airport are good, however. No issues with boarding and settled comfortably into seat. Warning! row 24 on Boeing 777-300, has only one window instead of two.No pre-take off drink, though did receive a hot towel and choice between sparkling wine and orange juice shortly after take off. Oddly served in a plastic glass, whereas all further drinks served in glassware. Huge soft pillow, blanket and simple amenity kit were available in the seat. Dinner was extremely tasty with choice of mains and ample pouring of wine. Wife bemoaned the fact there was no Pinot Gris, though the stewardess found a couple of glasses from business class. there were two dedicated toilets, one of which was large by airline standards (located on A/B side of plane) dedicated to Premium economy. IFE was excellent with an extensive ranges of films/TV shows, though whilst the seats were great for a short haul flight, they proved not so comfortable for a haul of 12 hours. This was partly due to the cabin being very hot. The footrest was also a bit of a fiddle to move and store back into place. The majority of passengers were dressed comfortable in track-ants and seemed to nod off with little problem. We must learn from this! One thing Air NZ excels at, is the ability to order additional snacks and drinks through seat back TV screen, Free in Business and Premium Economy, though may cost, depending on fare type in economy. There was no WI-FI on this flight, though free WI-FI was available to all passengers on the return flight. Another major plus for Air AZ. A good breakfast (with the exception of the most revolting cup to tea ever!) prior to landing in SFO. The flight was then spoilt by a two and a half hour queue to get through immigration in the United/Star Alliance Teminal. All in all, a much better experience than economy and pretty close to business class, bar the seat.

### "lounge ridiculously full"
Auckland to Melbourne. Selling Lounge tickets at $30? Business class lounge ridiculously full - couldn’t get a seat - 16 mins to get a coffee - no eye contact from staff. I paid full business fair - clearly corporate greed by selling Star Alliance or gold memberships and all the other memberships. I fly business regularly with various airlines and this does not happen - when I spoke to the lady on reception about this she actually agreed that it’s just to full. And she was embarrassed. No exclusivity. Open up a proper business lounge - who ever decided on this policy for the money grab I would fire. On the plane in the air perfect service - on the ground is just poor form.

### "the service was terrible"
We were regular customers of Air New Zealand. My husband is in the top tier and I am in the second. We flew just recently from Auckland to Singapore return. On the way back the service was terrible. The steward had a problem with us, we really have no idea what it was, he refused to serve us, got his colleague to do it. She was brusque and unfriendly. As we disembarked the steward at the exit door saw us coming and deliberately turned his back. Seriously we were really confused. Anyway wrote to Air New Zealand about this abominable service and to date have not even had a response.

### "absolutely sad and disappointed"
Auckland to Nelson. Very inconvenient and worst airline compared to Jetstar. Jetstar had all flights departed and Air New Zealand all flights cancelled. We came early morning 6.30 am and wait till 2.15 PM after so many delays . We are absolutely sad and disappointed that no alternative was provided to us.

### "always seem to run late"
Not Verified |  Auckland to Los Angeles. Every flight I have taken with Air New Zealand this year has been delayed. In this case, I missed my connection to Vegas (due to late departure out of Auckland, which then led on to further delays on the ground at Las Vegas), and had to rush around trying to get on a later flight. I am OK with the services offered on the aircraft (although they will never win any awards), but they really need to improve their operating efficiency. Both domestic and international always seem to run late - that is what people really want and need. Also, please consider giving people the option to choose whether they view just a simple safety briefing, or whether they want to endure the happy clappy briefing with a host of NZ "celebrities". The latest is agony after the 2nd viewing. Maybe spend less on those and more on getting aircraft to run on time.

### "What a poor airline"
Nadi to Perth via Auckland. What a poor airline. Seriously. Book two people onto a flight and they seat us in two separate seats away from each other. And for a 7.5 hour flight offer no food or entertainment service unless you pay extra. They completely gouge customers. Would not recommend this airline at all.

### "Very basic service"
Auckland to Taupo. Very basic service. Unfriendly staff at the airport. Poor boarding. The plane was small, people with lots of big bags, during the short flight water was offered but the attendant was lacking any table or trolley, just plastic cups and a bottle of water - in consequence some water was poured out on the floor. Everything looked so basic.

### "Time to lift your game"
Napier to Brisbane via Auckland. Poor effort Air New Zealand. Of the 4 flights involved in my Napier-Auckland-Brisbane return flights the other day everyone of those flights were delayed in some form or another. Anything from 25 minutes to 1.15 minutes. The delays generally occurred either travelling to the airport, once at the airport and/or waiting to board. Do you have any idea (or care) what this does for the stress levels for connecting flights. When you think you have a 2 hour plus time between domestic and international and you end up running with bags in tow. Include in that returning to Auckland and having to go through customs - what an absolute disgrace and embarrassment that set up is for new visitors to the country - over crowded lines that are taking 25-30 minutes to get through to add to those stress levels. I thought I might have got unlucky - not so my wife and son travelled separately a day behind me - all their 4 flights were also delayed. Time to lift your game Air NZ

### "worst experience ever"
Auckland to Houston. Never again! I consider myself an avid traveler! We were kicked out of our prebooked seats and placed at the end of the aircraft. We had precooked our seats as we had a horrible experience with our previous flight from Sydney to Auckland. Poor customer service and obnoxious staff. The lack of care, compassion or willingness of the staff to at least even try to help was surprising and to get away with such behavior is rather surprising and unbelievable. We are avid travelers and have travelled around the world and wanted to trying Air New Zealand but will never fly with them again. Rude staff, poor service and worst experience ever. Please save yourself the hassle and book with another airline! !

### "Never again"
(This was a Cathay code-share on an Air NZ aircraft). On a return trip from Auckland to Hong Kong I got virtually no sleep on both sectors because the seats are so uncomfortable. I'm tall (193cm) but have found (for instance) SIA Economy on long haul flights over the last 10 years to be comfortable enough to get at least 5 hours sleep each time - not so on Air NZ. The Economy seats on the Air NZ 787 are like planks of wood, and in fact look like that if you lift up the arm rests. I also couldn't quite stretch out my legs under the seat in front (like in SIA) because the bottom of that seat is too low. Even having a spare seat beside me each time did little to improve matters. Never again.

### "get professional Air NZ"
Time to pick your game up Air NZ. I recently took Air NZ to Japan and back. The trip out was ok, window seat was comfortable enough. The trip back was a different matter. Centre aisle seat and very hard and uncomfortable. Unfriendly Air Hostesses who were abrupt and absolutely no help whatsoever. I apparently tried to use the wrong bathroom and was told in no uncertain terms it wasn't for me and to use the other one. This left me feeling like a 5yo who had just been told off by his mother, no courtesy at all. Then the meal announcements which they announced wrong 4 times before getting it right. And it's pronounced rat-a-tooy not rat-a-tooly. The NZ accent was so bad I wanted to shrink into my seat, a 14yo old school girl would sound better. I was absolutely embarrassed. Then at 6am offering coffee service but when I ordered it (which was as soon as it appeared on my screen) I was informed the kitchen was closed. Are you kidding me, what kitchen would that be? It's a coffee pot! I realised then I had not seen one person served anything at all besides the meal. Get rid these lazy over paid idiots, sack your trainer and start looking at other airlines to see what service is all about. Time to ditch the hokey kiwi manner and accent, get professional Air NZ. You are getting tired and self important and it is obvious. I won't be flying international Air NZ after this awful experience.

### "shoddy management culture"
We were having vehicle problems and arrived to a small country airport called Kerikeri at 9.41am when the flight was 9.50am. Ordinarily, my understanding was that we had to be at the airport 30 minutes before. I paid for a full 23 kg baggage flight. At Kerikeri the attendant did not greet us. She just said you cant take the bag, you're too late, just take 7 kgs. I told her I was returning to Australia. Her attitude was brash, not helpful and she was not prepared to offer options for me after paying over $500 for the flight. She even smiled when she said sorry the bag can't go. In my mind, the bag could of been taken, thrown into the hold as people were still boarding, the plane had not turned on, the doors were still open. Kerikeri is a 'one horse airport' that if the lights turned out, there is nothing there. It has a plane come in 2 x in a day so extra service can be afforded. It is not like they are rushed off their feet. But this attitude seeps through all of Air New Zealand who provide the same type of basic people in Auckland domestic airport and I had the misfortune of this group in 5 May 2019 when no one helped to show me to my plane access. Didnt take my ticket. Just stood around and said nothing. I even almost missed my flight to Palmerston North because I couldnt understand the announcer who had a hick Pacific Island accent and could not pronounce 'flight boarding' let alone Palmerston North. Again in 18 March 2019 when the guy standing there and doing nothing, throws a ticket at my 67 year old sister because she turned up 20 minutes before their domestic flight which is stated on their ticket. He tells her that she should of been on the plane 20 minutes before throwing her ticket at her. She is running down the gang way towards her plane and the other staff stand there taking no notice that she needed help Air New Zealand are shoddy, backward group whose attitude on the ground has to come from an ingrained shoddy management culture and that should be changed. I am a NZer who is ashamed that the NZ government and NZ Tourist board would ever allow Air New Zealand to be the first experience to tourists of Aotearoa New Zealand because it is bad.

### "horror flight with no dinner"
Not Verified |  Having never flown with Air New Zealand I decided to take this flight rather than Virgin as it meant collecting my suitcase in AKL and booking thru to Brisbane. We waited 4.5 hrs in Auckland without information as to why the 2 hour extra wait, only to be told on board it was a catering issue! Other passengers had to connect with international airlines to Europe and were desperate. This was “a brand new wonderful plane” I was told! There were 40 rows of the skinniest tightest most uncomfortable seats I’ve ever sat in my long life of long distant flying. No food unless you were lucky enough to find and “tick” the 'food' box on the booking form and pay for it. I’d paid nearly $500 for this horror flight with no dinner. We got in at 11 pm instead of 8.30pm. Never again will I fly with this airline. I've flown with Ryanair for $180 or less in more comfort!

### "don’t receive the airline points"
Vancouver to Sydney via Auckland. Buyer Beware. This is more for when you buy a ticket and you don’t receive the airline points for star alliance. We purchased our tickets on line thru a company not Air New Zealand. No one mentioned it was a discounted flight, also we paid over 1300$ per person, which other company’s were selling it for the same amount. And we also upgraded to the sky couch for another $699 each way, which no one told us this ticket does not qualify . We expected to get our Air points. I questioned it and Air New Zealand said no way it was discounted,and would not qualify. Then said Thank you for the inquiry, and see you soon. Air Canada told me that Air New Zealand never honor and wished me lunch when I notified them. Do they think we will ever travel Air New Zealand again. No way, I travel to get points to travel again, when you buy a ticket and have not been notified it’s a discounted ticket. Air New Zealand, should honor if they are a true Air Alliance Partner

### "Premium economy on Air NZ is a joke"
Not Verified |  Auckland to Los Angeles. Sat writing this as I wait for my next flight. Shockingly bad: this was leg 1 through to London and I used airpoints to upgrade this portion to premium economy. No welcome, no chat, fizzy wine after an age to ‘welcome’ you on board in a plastic cup! No menu. I was 2 in a row of 4: fair enough, it was a last moment thing: but when it takes nearly 10 minutes to bring a glass of water (or climb over sleeping co-passengers) that’s bad. The staff were overworked and grumpy. Premium economy on Air NZ is a joke. Never again. It’s not what Air NZ used to be and it’s frankly not good enough for our National Airline.

### "start being on time"
Not Verified |  I am presently waiting at Christchurch airport for Air New Zealand to take me to Auckland they are very late and this is the second time on two flights that they have achieved serious delays. I stopped taking Jetstar because they were always late I believe in New Zealand is the new Jetstar Air New Zealand it is time stop talking and started being on time.

### "won't be flying with you again"
Hong Kong to Auckland. My past flight with Air New Zealand made me embarrassed to call it our national airline. It first started off with an appealing safety video. While coming from Hong Kong to Auckland I dealt with two air hostesses one I could barely understand as she was so quiet (that's fine) but she couldn't pronounce Sauvignon blanc (also fine, I don't drink it) but she obviously couldn't speak English very well. I would expect her to have had a chat with the New Zealand staff before her shift. The other older lady that served me, was possibly the rudest hostess with snapping replies, shoving food and drinks in your face, no smile, and talking to customers with no respect. When my vegetarian meal came they hadn't yet announced the meals were coming out and had just turned up the lights - so I had my seat back, tray up with my eye mask on. I got the rudest shake awake while I tried to quickly get myself ready for my meal, the hostess held my meal in front of my face blocking the view of my tray table. She stood they huffing and rolling her eyes. I've not felt so disrespected in a long time. Not only that but my vegetarian meal consisted of cold, stodgy, plain pasta - that I couldn't bring myself to eat. I was then to nervous to ask the staff for snacks after the meal and sat there hungry for the duration. The in flight entertainment was abysmal. The seats won't let you sit comfortably if you are taller than 5ft6''. There was a constant line for the toilets, which meant they weren't cleaned. And then there was a hold up getting off the plane because someone had fallen ill but there was hardly any communication between the customers and staff. I had already had 2 other flights on the sane journey home which were Indian and Russian operated and those 2 flights were impeccable! I paid extra to get an air New Zealand flight as I thought the quality and service were world class. How I was sorely mistaken. Air New Zealand you have let us down. I won't be flying with you again.

### "couldn't fault any of their service"
We had a very entertaining flight across to Auckland. The pilot was quite a comedian and had us all laughing. I also like Air New Zealands safety video, it is also quite entertaining and worth watching. I couldn't fault any of their service, on the ground or in the air.

### "ridiculous alcohol policy"
Wellington to Auckland. My only issue is with their on board service, upon asking for a beer, was of course expecting to pay for it, I was told that they don't sell alcohol on board. The FA even slightly sarcastically commented that Jetstar sell alcohol. On further research I found that Air New Zealand have something called a Koru hour on some morning and evening flights where complementary snacks and alcoholic drinks are offered, but not on flights under 50 mins or weekends or public holidays. What a ridiculous exclusive perk and what a ridiculous alcohol policy which to my knowledge no other airline has, most airlines are desperate to sell you snacks and drinks.

### "cancelled due to weather"
Queenstown to Auckland. Our flight was cancelled due to weather. We were asking to get a refund for half the cost we paid the airline. They refused the refund since they said it was not their fault. It was not our fault as well. They told us to contact our travel insurance. Unfortunately we do not have it. Hope they can improve in this regard, be more fair. If a customer is unable to board the plane due to weather emergency, there should be a way to reimburse half the price.

### "forced me to buy a new ticket"
I am flying to Hokitika from Christchurch and return mostly every week for the last 10 months for my work. Air New Zealand had cancelled or delayed flights so many times with out any apologies or warning due to various reasons and I had to take leave from work for no-show. Every time I go to the airport and come back. Last Sunday I waited at home expecting a cancellation notice as my Air New Zealand web browser was not updating the flight status. I checked in and arrived at the gate 10 minutes prior to the departure gate but the staff didn't allow me to board. Flight was still there and the status was in the final call. They forced me to buy a new ticket for the next day with a few giggle in their face.

### "attitude of staff very unsatisfactory"
Flew Perth to Wellington via Auckland, premium economy to Auckland, economy to Wellington leaving Perth on Feb 1st. Perth-Auckland sector on leased EVA Air 777 due to unscheduled engine maintenance and 787’s. Seat comfortable and premium economy pretty empty. Stuck on the ground in Perth due to plane having no satellite connection to Auckland so having to get new flight path sent manually to Perth airport, printed and brought onto plane. Approx 90 minutes stuck on ground waiting for this. Cabin staff pretty old and not particularly friendly, wasn’t offered a water during the delay. Flight itself was fine, dinner was delicious. Despite pretty empty premium economy call bell not answered 90% of the time, I know it’s not business class but would have expected better service, maybe they knew I was only there through an accepted upgrade bid. Cabin crew generally pretty quite passive aggressive, didn’t seem to enjoy their job anymore. Maybe time to move on. Arrived in Auckland with 35 minutes before my flight to Wellington departed, on mentioning this to purser got a curt response that there would be another flight in an hour anyway so what was the big deal. Ground staff in Auckland refreshingly friendly and helpful on putting me on next flight to Wellington. This short flight was pretty unremarkable, no complaints with it. Overall a comfortable journey but attitude of staff on Perth to Auckland very unsatisfactory.

### "did not get seats we booked"
Melbourne to Los Angeles via Auckland. The check-in staff at the Melbourne airport was new and inexperienced and took over 1 and a half hours to check our bags in. There were no complications. We did not have excess luggage. Our US visas were in order. We did not get the seats we booked 6 months in advance. We wanted to sit together but the system has changed our seats. Now we weren't sitting together. When we boarded our flight from MEL to AKL it was an old Singapore Airlines B777-200 aircraft with Singapore Airlines furniture but old and dirty. There were many things missing like food, menu card etc. The cabin crew thought it was okay and it was funny. They were cracking jokes and laughing the whole time when we who paid a lot of money did not find it funny at all! The AKL-LAX and LAX-AKL-MEL sectors were good. Awesome free wifi on all these sectors except the MEL-AKL flight. The cabin crew were friendly and attentive. Food was average. The amenity kit was good. Entertainment system was above average. Flights were on time. The pursers came up to me and thanked me and wished me a pleasant stay at the end of all the flights. The cabin crew who served came up to me introduced themselves and welcomed me at the beginning of all the flights. The Air New Zealand lounges were lovely and clean and the food was good except the Star Alliance Lounge in LAX. It was so crowded and busy like a fish market and the food was disgusting.

### "they all failed me"
Auckland to Queenstown. Arrived early, 3 flights before mine and they wouldn't let me fly early. Was invited to check in and told to go the the Koru lounge, that I pay a membership for, I was told I couldn't enter as I was too early. Checked my bags as top load, fragile and they told me to sign away their liability for damages because my ukulele was in there. Have spoken with 3 different staff, they all had varying opinions and they all failed me in customer service today.

### "I will never fly ANZ again"
Christchurch to Auckland. Very disappointed in experience with Air New Zealand! Was charged $200 for extra checked bag after carry on bag was weighed- I’ve never had my carry-on weighed. It was the right dimensions. Had a panic of repacking in the airport, threw away a bunch of stuff, then couldn’t find the very rude workers who had held our boarding passes for ransom - had to get new ones printed from another rude, impatient worker. We were not told that overnight flight (over 8 hrs in air) we would not be served  food, including snack or even juice. I understand if that is the ticket that I bought (which I didn’t know because travel agent didn’t know this was how ANZ does things)- but a clarification before getting on the plane would have been very helpful. Never have I had an overnight flight that didn’t at least throw me a bag of pretzels and some juice. I felt like a second class citizen. No entertainment available without hefty price. I will never fly ANZ again.

### "lost my luggage"
Christchurch to Vancouver via Auckland. Air New Zealand lost my luggage for four days they offered me no service at all. I had to phone them all the time for instructions of retrieving my luggage and to get status updates. Besides that, in my luggage was all my camping gear, so without this gear I could not go camping as planned and had to stay in more expensive accommodation. Also I could not provide my own meals as planned, but had to go to a restaurant. Air Nz offered a total of 200 NZD compensation, in stead of the 700 NZD I had for extra cost. After complaining about this, Air NZ stated that this is business as usual and that by flying with them you agree with these terms. These circumstances made our holidays in NZ have a bad start. But also for this fact Air NZ didn't offer any compensation. But the errors by Air NZ continued when flying with them back to Vancouver from Auckland. In Christchurch an employee of Air NZ stated we had to re-checkin our checked in luggage. In the airplane the flight attendants stated whe didn't have to pick up the luggage en re-check it in. When asking another employee of Air NZ about this (just to be sure) he stated we did need to re-checkin our checked in luggage. So we went through customs and to the luggage belt to pick up our luggage, but our luggage did not come. Asking another employee of Air NZ about this, she said we didn't have to pick it up: so we went through customs for nothing.. thank you Air NZ for wasting our time again.

### "Absolutely disgusted"
Brisbane to Papeete via Auckland. Absolutely disgusted with Air New Zealand, I have flights booked from Brisbane to Papeete this Friday that were originally landing at 7am,  now landing at 12.30am and originally departing at 9am, now departing at 2am. So I now have to book two extra nights accommodation and there were no alternative flights either day each side of my flights. Air New Zealand have basically said too bad, zero compensation, no free accommodation for those nights, no meal tickets, nothing. I don't see how an airline can change flight times so drastically and you just have to deal with it. Yes I could get a refund, but then I lose all my accommodation and no other airlines fly to Tahiti from Australia. Won't be flying with them again.

### "value for money is excellent"
Tauranga to Perth via Auckland. Having traveled PER - NZ return 6 monthly for nearly 10 yrs, I can comment with confidence about the experience. I have always found AirNZ staff extremely helpful, and resourceful in dealing with issues, most recently with 2017 urgent repairs/aircraft replacement due to the 787 engine issues, when I was given a 500-airpoint bonus as compensation. This was fair and much appreciated. This year, the same aircraft replacement issue occurred - no points bonus but the replacement craft was so comfortable my partner and I enjoyed the flight. The herringbone seats aren't great for communication when travelling with others, but no worse than Qantas Business suites in this regard, although AirNZ are a bit more cramped. Catering on flights and in lounges is great and puts Qantas to shame, so overall, value for money is excellent, when compared with comparative mileage flights - Air NZ definitely wins. The Airpoints program is very restrictive compared to Qantas - eg my partner receives no points for the return trip from NZ (fully paid) having flown out on points. Outrageously unfair. The app is great, though.

### "really poor customer service"
Buenos Aires to Sydney via Auckland. My flight was cancelled in the last minute, really poor customer service and they don’t keep their promises. Hours in the phone trying to solve a problem but still haven’t had a solution from them. Won’t be flying with Air New Zealand again.

### "changes quite disappointing"
Buenos Aires to Brisbane via Auckland. The crew service and the food were great as we have come to expect from air NZ but the herringbone seat layout means you are disconnected from your travelling companion. And whatever possesed them to dumb down the safety video with brain deadening rap? We had travelled with them quite a few times a few years ago so we found the changes quite disappointing.

### "I can’t really complain"
Queenstown to Auckland. This was an internal flight from Queenstown to Auckland. I can’t really complain. Nice new and clean aircraft. The crew were pretty good. For short haul exactly what you want for a short haul flight.

### "Seats quite comfortable"
San Francisco to Sydney via Auckland. We paid an extra USD $50 for a preferred seat (a bit more extra legroom) on the first flight. The flight leaving SFO was about 1 hour late, making us worry about missing our connecting flight. But the staff were fantastic, giving us constant updates and reassuring us that the ground staff at Auckland knew about our late arrival. As there were over 25 of us going on to the Sydney flight, they held the plane for us. Excellent entertainment selection, and the food was good as well. Seats quite comfortable, and clean toilets. The level of service was wonderful- friendly helpful staff. The only couple of downsides were the seat configuration on the 777- it was 3-4-3 which felt a bit squashy, and we were only allowed 1 suitcase, compared to 2 which you normally get flying from the USA. That being said, I loved flying with Air NZ and will definitely fly with them again.

### "this airline was the worst"
Queenstown to Sydney. I would not use again - Bad customer service and handling baggage! Very bad experience on my first experience using Air New Zealand. Missing bag on flight to Auckland, there is no update unless you call or email them. and lodge claim as per instruction on website about compensation of replacing a missing items, they refused to pay and told us to ask for travel insurance with out any reason why been declined even you have followed what on website. Damage baggage (stroller) on flight back to Sydney. again no update unless you call or email them and really hard to dealing with the claim team. end up i asked for replacement after 10 days (after multiple email and phone call) but i need to pay first the fee and they will transferred in 10-15 days. Definitively I wont use this airline again, this airline was the worst.

### "Shame on you Air New Zealand"
Napier/Hastings to Brisbane via Auckland. I cannot believe the unprofessional service we have been provided by Air New Zealand again! I'm so lucky to have a brother in NZ that is happy to take my special needs brother each year to give me a break from looking after him. My brother is 60 years old and travels with Air New Zealand airline pretty well every year! This is the second time they have completely let their duty of care lapse and dumped my brother out in the international airport without contacting me! It took me over a hour to locate him and I found him wandering aimlessly asking passengers for help! I specifically booked this trip with advise to the person on booking as well as advising the desk at the airport as well. Would you do this if this was an actual 6 year old child? Shame on you Air New Zealand. I will not only never travel with your airline ever again, I will be telling everyone I know! !

### "never fly this airline again"
Queenstown to Sydney. Even through the flight was delayed by over an hour and was waiting at the gate after all the passengers boarded, none of the passenger luggage was loaded into the aircraft. The crew got all of their luggage though. The flight crew didn't inform us about this throughout the 3 hour flight. We came to know about this at baggage claim at Sydney airport from Sydney airport. Since I had to leave for San Jose the next day I had arranged for my bags to be delivered to my address. I found the staff at the customer service desk very unhelpful and clueless. They we're try to pass on the blame to someone else and didn't attempt to help me locate my bags. I would never fly this airline again.

### "only received two drinks"
Brisbane to Auckland. Pros: Check-in - Fast and very helpful staff Lounge - nice views of runway. Cons: Air New Zealand App and information screen - informed passengers to be at our gate an hour early. But our flight arrived late. To make it worse the app and screen said boarding and our plane wasn’t even there. Wifi was not enabled, one nice flight attendant did ask other crew members but she was shut down by the inflight Service Manager. Inflight service only received two drinks the whole flight. Was told to use the inflight snacks and beverage option however it was not working and kept saying “this service has now ended”.

### "helped me to get the refund"
Melbourne to San Francisco via Auckland. Per my previous posting on: "give you the round about" C Deane (United States) 15th June 2018 After posting NO Customer Service from Air New Zealand I finally flew back again in October 2018 to the US and tried one more time to contact SF Air New Zealand - to refund my $45 lock service. I was very lucky to meet with an Ops Mgr SFO  who helped me thoroughly to get the refund. I have been a ping-pong ball by Air New Zealand in Auckland for 5 months (10 wild-goose-chase emails) - guess, they do not understand what is "customer service" unless they all learn from the US. Thanks to him who was so great in assisting - the problem: Air New Zealand did NOT assigned me a reference number on my case and they have requested me to get one. Are you serious? When I am in another country and email was not responded? That I have to chase after your staff half way around the globe to get a reference number case when your staff forgot to assign one? Any apology - no. But I do really appreciate the San Francisco Ops Manager. He deserve a promotion and a good raise.

### "Overall disappointing"
Singapore to Auckland. Overall disappointing. First we had to repack out luggage because of one of the case was 2 kilo's above 23kg. The app didnt work for check-in and gave us two seats at the very back row. The evening dinner was incomplete and the continental breakfast sold out. It took about 30 minutes from the staff for our request and some staff react arrogant is you say things are missing.

### "inflexible on bag weight"
Christchurch to Brisbane. Air New Zealand very inflexible on bag weight. 2kg over and only option was to pay $170. Could have got a second bag for $60, but because had checked in at kiosk, "that is not an option anymore". Made my journey very stressful as was also relocating my pet. Had to throw out items to avoid high charge. I just found them very unhelpful and rude. I had flown Air NZ previously as thought they were more flexible and not revenue generating over a couple of kgs. Will try and fly Virgin/Jet Star now as Air NZ is really no better.

### "inflight offerings are pathetic"
Auckland to Gold Coast. This is an excellent airline in the premium cabins. They are however woeful in economy on the trans-Tasman. As they only fly to the Gold Coast with narrow body aircraft there is no premium cabin and the best you can get is ‘Works Deluxe’. We had expiring Airpoints so decided to use them for this product. There is nothing deluxe about the economy experience. The meal was disgusting and not fit for human consumption. Not that they care. They just clear it away as though it’s nothing out of the ordinary that the food remains untouched. Beverages are served in tiny plastic cups that you can drink in two mouthfuls and you are continually requesting refills (complimentary alcohol on this fare class). The IFE is pitiful in content. Two crew members were obliging the others made you feel it was beneath them to lower themselves to serve you. Based on the flight I can see why this airline makes record profits - the inflight offerings are pathetic and would cost them very little. Unfortunately Kiwis are blindly loyal to this over rated airline and therefore they continue to get away with a sub standard product. Do not believe the hype on their website - it’s mostly misleading garbage to make you think this is a glamorous airline.

### "staff friendly, but not adequate"
Singapore to Auckland. Sitting on row 59 it was very cold. The selected meals were not available any more. More than 30 minutes waiting for missing bread. Ordering red wine, we had to wait very long. Eventually got the wrong wine. The staff was friendly, but not adequate.

### "been the worst experience"
Melbourne to Auckland. Its been the worst experience dealing with this Airline after making my booking. A very arrogant and rude Supervisor  handled the issue very abruptly. I was charged the seat selection when I didn't wanted to, The website didn't let me proceed without selecting the seat and charged me $10 for it during booking. When I raised my concern it was brushed by in a very arrogant approach after 1hr on the phone. Will never fly with this airline. They rip you off during and after sale process. No point, pay a little more and fly with another airline. Disgusted by his approach to this issue shows how the airline trains this big heads

### "staff was exceptionally rude"
Not Verified |  Queenstown to Wellington. One airport staff at Queenstown airport was exceptionally rude. Be sure you know how to put your luggage tag on before dropping off you bag, otherwise you will be degraded. Luckily, I know how to read but being 4am I misread the directions and was yelled at for not putting my bag tag on correctly. She told me three times in a row that I did not read the directions correctly. Instead, she could have used one of those times to help me but chose not to. If you are hard of seeing or unable to read, be sure you ask a friend to put the tag on for you before walking up to the bag drop off area. I’m sure this was an isolated incident with this specific staff member and is not a reflection of Air New Zealand as a whole. However, this was my very first experience with Air New Zealand, and it was not a pleasant one.

### "a way sub-par product"
Auckland to Perth. Booked and paid for a modern Business Class experience on a Boeing 787. Received a below standard seat on an old, ex-SQ Boeing 777. Seats were actually painful to sit in. Understand that NZ has grounded many of the Boeing 787s due to engine issues,  but I paid for a premium product, and received a way sub-par product. So where is my partial refund?

### "a very traumatic experience"
Not Verified |  Christchurch to Napier via Wellington. Not one to complain generally, I feel I must write of my unfortunate experience 10 December 2018. I was ticketed to fly on NZ5326 which left 20-30 mins late. On disembarking I proceeded to the gate for my connection, arriving as the tape was being put across and told that I had to rebook. At the ticket desk I was abruptly told that i had to pay $100, no explanation given. I was understandingly unhappy. The Supervisor took my ticket away for a good 10-15 minutes, Still no explanation. Finally after waiting for another 20 or so minutes, I received a ticket for my connecting flight 3.5 hours later. Throughout this ordeal, at no stage were the staff professional,helpful or friendly. I almost felt I was in a foreign country. It was a very traumatic experience. Whatever happened to "Customer Service

### "Don't believe the hype"
Auckland to Christchurch. Better service with a low-cost airline. Don't believe the hype. Second delay in as many flights. If a low-cost airline can keep to schedule why not the national carrier. If you want to be on time and have a little extra in your pocket look elsewhere.

### "leaves much to be desired"
Auckland to Houston. Seat 2K is a window seat on the right side of the cabin. It is row two of the nine rows in Business Class on version 2 of ANZ’s 787-9. Three seats abreast herringbone configuration. The crew walks past this seat, over and over, delivering food and drinks to the seven rows of business class passengers behind it, as do passengers on their way to the business-class galley and restrooms. On my outbound flight to Auckland I sat in the last row of business class. It was a better, quieter, more private experience. Overhead storage for seat 2K, like all other window seats, is consumed by bedding. The first three rows of the center section have zero overhead storage (though the bedding can be stored behind those seats), so the passengers in the center seats must use the storage space that would have otherwise been available to passengers in the window seats. The fellow from the center seat had already filled the half of the bin that was not filled with bedding. Space is limited to begin with, and there is no usable underseat space. I pulled my mattress and pillow out of the overhead storage bin so that the fellow in the center seat and I could both stow our carry-ons. When the FA told me I couldn't put the mattress in the sizable, yawning cavity behind my seat, I told him he should try to find a space for it. So he took it away into the nether regions of the forward galley. As I sit here, my shoes are under the ottoman and there's a pillow and blanket on the floor where my feet are supposed to be. There's no armrest for my right arm. Crew is really nice in dealing with my, er, "concern" about the lack of storage space. Probably as exasperated about it as I. They are as pleasant, tactful, and as helpful as they can be. Really delightful people, dealing with what seem to be poor design features. They served champagne before departure, and that was nice. There's a little fold-out shelf behind my right arm and shoulder, but I don't know that it has any practical use. It is also lit, for some reason known only to Boeing and, presumably, ANZ. It's certainly not a place to put an empty champagne glass. The ANZ headphones are not good. I'd advise travelers to bring their own headphones. There's a jack to plug them into so that you can listen to the inflight entertainment, and both a USB charging port and a 110v outlet for your own devices. As I found on my previous long-haul ANZ flight on the same aircraft type, there appears to be a heat source under the seat. After a short time lying in the bed it becomes sweltering hot. I found the bed itself, under the mattress, to be warm. Very uncomfortable when used as a bed. The plane has large windows but they are behind you, so looking out of them requires turning your head more than 90 degrees. The view out the window would be better than the view of the feet and unclad legs of the person across the aisle, who's wearing shorts and went to bed shortly after takeoff, before dinner. Food is delicious and plentiful. Snacks are available any time. Overall, ANZ’s service is excellent, both on the ground and on the plane. The crew was marvelous. The aircraft is new and modern. But the seat layout and design, the lack of storage space both in the overhead and around the seat, and the temperature of the bed leaves much to be desired. As a result, I’m not sure the additional cost of a business-class ticket is worth the money.

### "start acting like a LCC"
Sydney to Auckland. My experience started with a relaxing time in the Lounge. Departure was well managed, prioritising Star Alliance and high tier Frequent Flyer Status. Cabin Crew were lovely and attentive, with a smile. Now onto the less positive, I believe that if an airline portray itself as a full service airlines, it needs to act accordingly. Economy fares should always include checked baggage and meals on international flights, otherwise do not mislead customers and start acting like a LCC. Lastly, IFE should always be available not based on fares purchase.

### "never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Flight was delayed due to weather. We missed our connecting international flight meaning we have to pay for another ticket home. We booked our AirNZ flight giving us 4 hours leeway in case of any problems. On board the cabin crew attendant said it was our fault for not leaving enough time! Really unhelpful and they made no attempt to offer us any assistance or guidance once we landed. Also the inflight snack was a choice of a biscuit! Yes 1 biscuit or some corn chips! Abysmal for a scheduled 2 hr flight. Will never fly with them again.

### "a terrible experience"
Auckland to Melbourne. Received a terrible experience with the Air NZ team in Melbourne!! The short version of the story is I paid for an upgrade to premium, and the Air NZ Melbourne team promised to have the upgrade applied, through a comedy of errors, there was a delay in applying the upgrade. By the time they attempted to apply the upgrade all premium and business seats were taken. When I challenged the Air NZ team on how this happened, they openly lied to me to cover themselves. To make matters worse, it has been hard work to get my money back and as compensation for my bad experience they have given me 100 points! Lift your game Air New Zealand.

### "experience was fantastic"
Brisbane to Rarotonga in business class. Check in agent at Brisbane Airport was aloof, flippant really. The check in agent communicated with short grunts essentially. However, the rest of the Air New Zealand business class experience was fantastic. The Koru Lounge at Brisbane Airport was great with a good view and was ambient. Our flights on each of the segments were in clean aircraft with beaut flight attendants. The food offerings were plentiful along with drinks. The business class seats were excellent. We had an ex Singapore Airlines 777-200 from Rarotonga to Auckland. The old Singapore Airlines business class was still comfortable for this 4 hour flight. The Air New Zealand premium business check in agents at Auckland International were just fantastic. I purchased inflight internet on the Auckland to Brisbane segment. It cost 27 Airpoints dollars (or $30 credit card). We felt that as business class passengers, surely Air New Zealand could have added this as complimentary. The internet connectivity between Auckland and Brisbane was faultless. The awarding of status credits bares inconsistencies. I do not understand how Brisbane to Auckland, then Auckland to Rarotonga are credited status credits as individual segments, but then Rarotonga to Auckland then Auckland to Brisbane is credited as one whole segment? We chose Air New Zealand to fly from Brisbane to Rarotonga return because it's the most decent business class offering of all the airlines on this route. However, in striving to achieve status, as we maintain with Qantas, the ad hoc awarding of status credits is left to be desired. However, we would recommend Air New Zealand business class flights. The flights themselves we cannot fault.

### "Terrible experience"
Perth to Dunedin via Auckland. Terrible experience. Starting from poor value for money. 3 hrs between connection and almost missed the next flight due to ultimate sluggish experience at Auckland airport. 2 hrs in one lane. Self transfer of luggage, really are you for real. Had to run (with luggage on trolley and a bub) towards domestic air from international airport for the next flight as the transfer bus was every 15 min and there was minimal time to next flight and the staff blamed me at domestic airport for coming late. The list goes on. Never again on Air NZ thats for sure.

### "their standards have plummeted"
Not Verified |  Auckland to Sydney. Terrible mix up with my wife's passport; surname changed well before flight and airpoints card updated with Air New Zealand assuring us the fare was altered. On the day still under maiden - caused huge delay and worry. Flown with these guys for years and their standards have plummeted in the last 18 months - avoid if you can.

### "crew in our cabin were second to none"
First time flying on the Dreamliner and also first time with Air New Zealand in over ten years. Boarding got under way smartly and was well organised for the 00.10 departure. Lovely welcome upon boarding and nice mood lighting in the cabin. My daughter and I were seated on the side and ended up with three seats that configure into the skycouch, was pretty good and it offered us extra room. The crew in our cabin were second to none, they treated us like we were old friends, so warm, kind and genuine. The meal was excellent and plentiful accompanied by a lovely Kiwi glass of Fizz followed by a Shiraz. Entertainment was good although I didn't watch much as I was lucky enough to get a decent sleep. Two hours out of Singapore breakfast was served and offered another glass of Fizz, great memory! We landed ahead of time and that capped off a great flight, best I'd had in ages. My sincere thanks and appreciation to the excellent crew, these guys are keepers!

### "has definitely slipped"
Not Verified |  Brisbane to Christchurch. Flight was great, great service, comfortable seat and plane was nice and clean. On the down side was the appalling meal, there were two options but by the time they got to me only one could be offered which was a bland chicken tandoori, rice and silverbeet, an appalling bland meal, I was most disappointed, Air New Zealand has definitely slipped here. There was a small fruit slice offered for a sweet.

### "crew very attentive"
My wife and I flew with Air New Zealand for the first time. What an awesome flight. We flew from Auckland to LAX. From the time we boarded the aircraft until we went through customs in LAX, they treated us very special. The food was great and the crew very attentive. They made up our lay flat bed and made sure we received anything to make our flight better. When we woke the next morning, coffee was waiting for you. They remade our bed back in to regular seats. Then a fantastic breakfast was served. We could not have ask for a better flight.

### "thank them so very much"
Auckland to Adelaide return. When we first walked into Adelaide airport the airport had 2 staff in the entrance and I went over and asked them nicely if they would be able to get me a wheelchair for my mum who was clearly having difficulty walking. They said you’ll have to go to air New Zealand part and they’ll help you. I was horrified with their service. Really very cruel if you saw how my mum struggled to walk. I saw and was told by my mum and sister how wonderful the staff were from the time I walked in with my mum at Adelaide airport to the air New Zealand booking part. till the time they arrived back in Nz where staff continued to help them all the way through. As soon as I arrived at the air Nz check point one of the staff came out from behind the counter. She got a wheelchair she helped label their bags. She arranged everything for us She was on the phone letting other staff know that you had a customer that required help. She arranged other staff to pick mum up on the other side. Anyone once we checked our bags through we waited where this lady had arranged a pick up point and 2 lovely woman arrived so calm and so patiently waited while we said our goodbyes. Don’t even know if I thanked them cause I’m not good with goodbyes but I hope I did. They even pushed my mum along side my sister. They collected them from different points and got them on and off the plane. From a distance as they wheeled mum They even cared enough to turn mum back around to wave to us as they left. I just can’t tell you how beautiful the staff were to my mum and sister. Thank you so... much for caring for them so well and with such care. I just want to thank them so very much for helping my sister and caring for my mum.

### "everything was well done"
I don't normally fly with Air New Zealand. However, today I completed two sectors on Air New Zealand (NZ102 and NZ101). The first sector I did in economy in a B787-9 and the second in Business class in a B777. I can't speak highly enough of the professionalism and service of Air New Zealand. Absolutely everything was well done. The lounge is beautiful and comfortable with plenty of well prepared high quality and tasty food (some of it prepared by chef right in front of you!). On the first sector I travelled in seat 37C on a 'works' economy ticket. The seat was comfortable, adequate leg room (I'm 178 tall and 90kg male) and the lunch served was a choice of osso bucco with mash and green beans, or cold roasted chicken breast salad (which was excellent!) followed by brownie and ice cream, yum! On the second sector, I was in seat 2A business premium. The seats are angled slightly away from the windows in such a way to give full aisle access from all seats, yet quite good privacy. They are wider than many business seats. Breakfast was amazing, a choice too wide to list but listen to this, fried eggs and bacon on an aeroplane? Really good stuff that I've not seen on any other! Coupled with the second-best inflight entertainment I've experienced (second to ICE), an excellent airline!

### "lucky to make a connecting flight"
Invercargill to Whangarei via Christchurch / Auckland. Air New Zealand was excellent, The only thing was I was lucky to make a connecting flight due to the time space between getting off one aircraft onto the other one I had to rush.

### "reputation is sliding downhill"
Not Verified |  Wellington to Hamilton. Engineering problems meant that our flight was cancelled 10 minutes before boarding. The airline had an awful lot of engineering issues and delays during the afternoon. I question this reasoning and wonder whether we were cancelled due to the plane not being full? First strike disappointment regarding the transparency of communications. Second strike was being transferred to the last trip of the day to another destination via a txt. Thanks for thinking of me but you could've transferred to a flight that actually landed in my home town. Having to collect bags again, check in again, go through security screening again and wait again for a flight that is delayed again! Anyway horrendous trip home via Auckland and bus to Hamilton. A trip where we were meant to be home by 7.45pm refreshed for work the next day turned into an 11.45pm exhausted mess. I thought this only happened with the likes of Jetstar not Air NZ. Air New Zealand reputation is sliding downhill. I will end on a positive. The counter staff in the Koru Lounge were helpful and the bus driver was amazing, smooth drive home thank you.

### "legroom was good"
London to Los Angeles return in November 2015. The staff were friendly and helpful. The legroom was good (not great, but who has great legroom economy these days?) I am 6'4" (195 cm) and felt pretty comfortable. The entertainment system was awesome with lots of movies and shows to choose from. The real kicker with Air New Zealand is that you can order drinks and snacks throughout your flight after the main meal.

### "attendants were super helpful"
Los Angeles to Raratonga return. I came to write this review because when I was looking for positive reviews on this airline I couldn't find many great ones and none from the route I was flying. We did economy regular and were comfortable on our long haul 10 hour overnight flight. The attendants were super helpful and concerned with comfort and safety. My bf had an injured foot and was wearing a boot and they even upgraded us on one of the routes. Entertainment and food were great too. Plane wasn't too big, but big enough and it was def one of the newer ones. One thing I wouldn't recommend if you're over 5' is getting the sky couch. I watched folks wish they could fully extend their legs. I wouldn't do it unless I had little kids with me or if i was by myself. I hope this helps anyone on the fence.

### "expect this flight to be cancelled"
Auckland to Whangarei. Have come to expect this flight to be cancelled, the reason I pay so much (nearly $200) for this 40 minute flight is so it takes 40 minutes. Plane was cancelled again today and had to take the bus replacement. This probably wouldn't be so bad if there was some sort of refund considering a bus doesnt cost $200 per person for a 3 hour ride. Seems like revenue gathering at the slightest hint it might rain.

### "extraordinarily bad seating"
Christchurch to Sydney. Cabin Manager had her birthday on the day we flew so champers all 'round plus it was my 60th so a lot of fun. Sadly let down by extraordinarily bad seating, the seats are a nightmare for people with lower back issues and I was almost crying from pain by the time we landed. Could never fly longer than a trans-Tasman route with them. I can only recommend the airline based on their crew, I would warn against the airline if you have any sort of issue with your back.

### "this is absolutely indecent"
Trans-Tasman flight on an A320 in economy. Rating 1 out of 10 for the nice cabin crew, the rest is worth 0/10. Seats are crammed so tightly that physically being able to sit is not obvious when you are 6ft3. Compared with Virgin Australia's 737 cabin, this is absolutely indecent. Then there's the service, if you can call it that. Don't forget that this is a full price airline, yet you don't get any food or snacks unless you pay extra. Want to check in your luggage? Pay extra. Want to use the IFE to watch a movie? Pay extra (!). For your Trans-Tasman trips, fly with VA or Qantas or even Jetstar, they're better value and infinitely more enjoyable than this parody of a bad airline.

### "Low cost services"
Auckland to Honolulu. Low cost services at full price, that's all I can say. We did buy our tickets last minute (due to a cancellation with another airline) and they were very expensive, and all they included was the seat and bags. No food service whatsoever on an 8 and a half hour flight. You could purchase snacks on board, however for the price we paid, we would not have expected this budget airline style behavior from a Star Alliance member airline. Moreover, even though we were supposed to fly on the Boeing 787, the flight was on a very old (Singapore Airlines decommissioned) Boeing 777 with an antique entertainment system (to be fair the website did warn us about this fact before ticket purchase). Other than that, legroom was fine and the seats were as you would expect from a very old 777: not that comfortable, but tolerable.

### "lacking common sense"
Christchurch to San Francisco via Auckland. I was to fly on the 14 July from Christchurch (NZ558) to Auckland at 4PM and from Auckland to San Francisco (NZ8). I arrived at the airport at 1.30PM which is early for a domestic flight only to see that my flight was cancelled. I then proceeded to the information counter and told the staff at the counter that my flight was cancelled. They then checked the computer and told me that the 3PM and 5PM flight to Auckland was full. After 10 minutes they tell me that they would put me on a 3PM flight from Christchurch to Wellington and then a 4.30 flight from Wellington to Auckland. In hindsight, I managed to get to Auckland in time to catch the flight to San Francisco but what would have happened if I did not get to the airport early? Why wasn't I informed of the cancellation? On the return flight AirNZ managed to screw up my flight once again. I was on NZ7 from SFO to Auckland (arrive at auckland at 5.45.am) and on a 8AM flight from Auckland to Christchurch. Instead AIrNZ had cancelled the 8AM flight and put me on a 7AM flight. How does one land at 5.45am clear customs and immigration and drop of luggage to make a 7AM flight? Again in this instance, I was not informed, not told of the cancellation of the 8 AM flight, and even if the flight was cancelled would it be common sense to put me on a later flight after 8AM from Auckland to Christchurch rather than an earlier flight? Lacking common sense and logical thinking here AirNZ, shame on you.

### "Top class services"
Flew Air New Zealand from Auckland to Tokyo. Top class services, tasty lunch and breakfast, high resolution screens, On demand food and drinks, comfortable seats, high quality cushion and blanket. An airline for five star upgrade.

### "toilet was dreadful"
Singapore to Auckland. First time on the Boeing 787 and the new economy seat was well designed. Everything has been throught off even down to the headphone jack and USB socket being up under the screen instead of being on the armrest so you don't get the cable caught up in your blanket when fidgeting around. There an electric socket for plug-in items down below. Entertainment system was good, crystal clear screen just like a tablet and simple to use. Just not the massive selection of movies and programs other airlines have unfortunately. Foods were good for both of supper and breakfast and you get a proper size mug when you have hot drink. Crews were helpful and nice. Only bad thing that let the experience down was the toilets, the one time I went to use towards the end of the flight was dreadful. Obviously not checked and cleaned often enough. They smelt pretty bad with dirty floor. I personally waited until we landed.

### Air New Zealand customer review
No better than the cheap budget airlines. Very average meal, the staff did smile which was good, but it took a long time to come back to remove the meal trays which meant a fair chunk of the flight was sitting bolt upright. But when we were checking in for our connecting flight the woman who was meant to assist in weighing bags was absolutely terrible. No eye contact, didn't know her job, didn't spend 1 min with us just said to go over to another staff and was clearly not interested in us at all, so she handed us onto a trainee who confidently spouted what turned out to be misinformation, and was rude and very defensive. The third Air New Zealand staff member actually knew what she was talking about but in stead of sympathising tried to defend the staff. Not what I would expect of a so called award winning airline.

### "an almost perfect flight"
Hong Kong to Auckland, this was an almost perfect flight. The crew were friendly, engaging and chatty - the purser spent time chatting to passengers and welcoming them aboard. There were top-ups of the champagne before take-off and the airline really excelled with their food and wine. They have a large list of high-end wines available, and were very proactive about getting passengers to taste them. The food was innovative and delicious - I had my first ever burger on a plane, and it was very good. IFE was well selected and varied. The amenity kit was great and high quality, and included lip balm and hand cream by a quality NZ company. Whilst the seat faced away from the window, I found the product itself very comfortable for both reclining and sleeping, and really liked the fact that they have a mattress on the bed, and large pillows - I slept really well. Loved everything about the trip!

### "Flight home was the opposite"
Auckland to Denpasar. Flight to Bali was great - two meals, two rounds of drinks for each meal and the crew couldn't be more helpful. Flight home was the opposite - one meal, on drink and crew was very unhelpful. I felt the movie selection was limited also.

### "Seat was very comfortable"
Auckland to Vancouver. Outstanding service on a busy route. Meals and beverages were top class and very reflective of Kiwi cuisine. Seat was very comfortable both for reclining and sleeping. Cabin crew went out of his way to talk to customers, even shaking  hands prior to being seated for landing.

### "advise others to avoid them"
Auckland to Denpasar. In the past, Air New Zealand was a great airline. I have flown with them domestic and they were great with good customer service. But the international flight from Auckland to Denpasar wasn't as good. There was no proper food for economy, only snacks you buy on plane. They offered only water tea or coffee. The crew were mostly very rude and were bumping into people in the isle, talking very unfriendly etc. Not a great flight for long haul by any means, grumpy unfriendly staff, not a high quality airline for long haul and would advise others to avoid them unless flying within New Zealand. I have found Jetstar long haul is by far better than air NZ long haul.

### "Would definitely recommend"
Nuku'alofa to Auckland. The flight was great and I had no problems whatsoever. My plane took off early and arrived early, the entertainment was amazing with all the latest movies and such, the food was pretty great and the service was very nice and welcoming. Would definitely recommend Air New Zealand

### "would fly with them again"
Sydney to Auckland and Queenstown to Sydney this month. SYD-AKL was on the Boeing 787-9. This plane was new and clean, however I felt the seat backs were a bit too hard for my liking, not a big deal on a 2 hour flight but probably more uncomfortable on longer haul flights. The leg room was decent and comfortable (keeping in mind I am a short person). Due to a busy day at Sydney airport the flight departed 2 hours late. Our flight from Queenstown to Sydney was on the A320. It departed 15 minutes early and arrived in Sydney 25 minutes early. The seats were more comfortable on this aircraft, in my opinion. The entertainment systems on Air NZ were great, a wide selection of tv shows and movies, plus the touch system was easy to use. Even if you haven't paid for entertainment you can simply swipe your credit card under the TV screen and for $10NZD have unlimited entertainment for the flight. Due to flying during school holidays, the price wasn't the cheapest, but competitive with other airlines. The staff were courteous and professional, I would definitely recommend Air NZ and would fly with them again.

### "I would avoid this airline"
Christchurch to Auckland. I thought they were good,but 3hrs before my domestic flight they just cancelled without any reasons. Placed me on another flight but that would mean i will miss my connecting flight. Had to reschedule all flights next day, no compensation at all. Next day, flight got delayed 1hr as well. I am trying to claim from insurance but they need to know the exact reason for flight cancellation,and Air New Zealand customer service email says they are busy at the moment and may take up to 20 days to reply. I would avoid this airline at all cost, surprised they are a member of star alliance at all to be honest.

### "my airline of last resort"
Not Verified |  Wellington to Queenstown. Over the last 35 years Air New Zealand have only really had four flights completely mucked up for me. Three of them have been in the last 6 months. They have cancelled flights due to mechanical problems with planes twice and now have lost my sons' bag. Worst of all the customer service team seems to be so used to complaints now that they no longer have the caring attitude they say recently had. Over the Lost bag we have had to contact them three times to get any sort of response and their response is a pathetic $100 offering for which we have to yet again stand in a queue at the baggage office at the airport. They have gone from being my carrier of choice to my airline of last resort. Such a shame to see a good brand being destroyed.

### "We are forever grateful"
This was our 2nd Air New Zealand Perth to Las Vegas Premium Economy flight. Wife was unfortunately hospitalised in Las Vegas after a fall and our return was delayed by a week. Insurance Company contacted Air NZ and we were rebooked for a week later than original flights. Wife and accompanying nurse travelled Business, myself in Premium Economy. Ground and Aircrew of both United and Air NZ were outstanding in the care and concern for my wife's comfort and safety. Being unable to stand & walk she had to be lifted in and out of wheelchairs and seats. I was also given unrestricted entry into Business Class to visit her and during our Auckland stopover given complimentary to the business Lounge. We are forever grateful.

### "Nothing was a problem"
Auckland to Shanghai. Effortless service, exceptional, welcome, great Business class product made better by the onboard team. Nothing was a problem for them, felt incredibly valued and looked after pre, during and on arrival into Shanghai to connect with Virgin Atlantic. Well done Air New Zealand.

### "airline doesn’t do upgrades"
Not Verified | Cairns to Auckland. The flight itself on Air New Zealand was fine with a friendly cabin crew, but the problems we had with the airline was getting the flight to operate. Our flight was continuously delayed at CNS until they finally decided to cancel our flight to AKL due to crew rest hours. The cancellation announcement came 2.5 hours after we were supposed to originally take off. The passengers were told to meet at a gate and it was a 15 minute wait to have an employee direct everyone to baggage claim to reclaim their bags and find a service desk to help all the stranded passengers. When the service desk opened another 20 minutes later there was only one employee figuring out arrangements and accommodations for a full flight. We waited in the middle of the line and after another 2.5 hours of waiting in the service line the employee told the passengers still waiting to be helped that they could find their own accommodations and transportation and be reimbursed, or they could go home and meet at the airport at 5 am for the rescheduled flight at 8 am the next morning. The airline was having trouble finding hotels for all the passengers and wasted everyone’s time by not telling everyone that they could find their own accommodations and be reimbursed hours earlier. We have a future flight with Air New Zealand from AKL to SFO and we asked if we could be upgraded on that 14 hour flight to better seats instead of the airline finding us a hotel or reimbursing us, and we were rudely told that the airline doesn’t do upgrades. The next morning we got to the airport as soon as the check in line opened and only one person was checking people in and helping people with their hotel reimbursements. We were also asked if we wanted a voucher for a complimentary breakfast instead of automatically being given the voucher. The airline didn’t prepare hotels ahead of time if they planned on canceling the flight and they continually had only one person taking care of an entire flight at the service desk and check in. Thankfully there were no problems once we boarded the plane.

### "Terrible customer service"
Auckland to Sydney. Horrible flight. Delayed for 1 hour both of my flights. Terrible customer service on board. The crew was very rude. Not recommended at all Air New Zealand.

### "Terrible flight"
Not Verified |  Auckland to Los Angeles. Terrible flight, extremely rude air hostess. Very tight on drinks, service was very average. Our family has always supported Air New Zealand flying a lot with them internationally, but  will avoid as much as possible after this experience. We were a family of 6 flying to a family event all of various ages and it was just awful - we all felt the same way.

### "missed our connection"
Not Verified |  Delayed on the trip down to Queenstown and delayed on the way back. 12 of us missed our connection from Auckland to Tauranga despite being told that the very small regional connection would wait for us (still boarding when we landed). Then, after half hearted apologies, we were put on a bus an hour later for the three hour trip to Tauranga (other aircraft full). There was a flight to a town close to Tauranga. This had seats available but they were not willing to work with us passengers. On the flight the flight attendants were excellent. The food was terrible. Choc chip cookie or chips. Both in plastic bags. No healthy alternative.

### "recommend not flying with them"
Scheduled to fly on Friday 18th May from HK to Auckland with Air New Zealand after arriving on a Lufthansa flight. Two weeks before my flight I received an email from the travel company I had booked with to say that the airline had rescheduled the flight and that I would not be able to make the connection and that I should contact the airline to rearrange. I contacted the airline who refused to deal with me directly and said they would only deal with the travel company I booked with. The travel company said they would deal with it and get back to me within 10 days. After 3 days they contacted me to say Air New Zealand would put me on the equivalent flight the next day, Saturday 19th May which I agreed to on condition that the airline would compensate me for accommodation and other extra costs due to having to spend a night in HK. After several phone calls and emails with the travel company I got nowhere and I booked accommodation myself. As a last resort I tried to find their customer service desk when i arrived in Hong Kong but the staff were gone and their Star Alliance colleagues refused to help me. Meanwhile Air New Zealand continued to ignore my attempts to contact them. The flight itself was ok. Food was decent airline food, the seat was reasonably comfortable and there was a good selection of entertainment. I was not allowed to check in online however because of the rescheduling which meant I was given a seat that didn't recline and was beside the toilets so was noisy. Still no response from Air New Zealand, with no attempt to compensate me for costs and inconvenience that was all their fault as the rescheduling was due to maintenance issues with their planes. The maintenance issues are expected to last for the rest of 2018, so I recommend not flying with them until they are sorted.

### "enclosed and claustrophobic"
Auckland to Houston. First time flying long-haul business and was really excited. Things started on a sour note when my flight was caught up in their Boeing 787 repair fiasco, resulting in a change of equipment and schedule. This resulted in me having to forfeit my connecting AA flight in IAH (to MIA) due to the much later arrival time. Air NZ stubbornly refused to compensate me for this so I had to suck it up and purchase a brand new flight. I must say that the Premium check-in area at AKL made me feel special. I have to comment though on the seating in Business Premier - who signed off on this design and lay-out (herringbone)? Unable to glance out of the window and feet facing towards the aisle. The seating pods had the dubious honour of feeling both enclosed and claustrophobic, yet without any sense of privacy. The food was also disappointing with virtually the same menu as the MEL - AKL sector, with really small portions. Lastly, making your Business customers pay for WiFi was just plain mean. Sorry Air NZ, I so wanted my trip to be awesome but it disappointed on many levels. Only saving grace were the crew.

### "No fuss at any point"
Auckland to Sydney. Great experience on Air New Zealand. No fuss at any point and a key highlight was the in-flight entertainment system. It was much more responsive than others that I had used on the trip and the introduction video on how to use your seat is well worth a watch. I never realised the sides of the headrests on the seats fold in. Apparently this is a feature on most planes with headrests. Made the 14 and 7 hour flights back from Sydney much better once I knew that bit of information.

### "surprised by the amount of leg room"
Flew Brisbane to Auckland with Air New Zealand. Boarded the aircraft on time, very clean, loading was finished for a right time departure. Didn't use the seatback entertainment system, as the couple next to me wished to chat. Very pleasantly surprised by the amount of leg room. My knees didn`t touch the seat in front and I'm over 6 foot four. Quite comfy as well. As it was only a three hour flight I didn't book a meal, but the people next to me did, looked okay and they said it was fine. The cabin crew kept me well topped up with mineral water, could have had tea or coffee. The cabin crew were very pleasant. More or less right time arrival, unfortunately there was no gate for us at Auckland airport so we stopped on a remote stand and were bussed to the terminal. Not really the airlines fault and it didn't take too long. The return flight was an Airbus A320 again clean, boarding commenced on time, again a clean well presented cabin. Not quite as much leg room. On time to push back a technical fault was found and a fitter had to be called resulting in a 30 minute late departure. These things happen with any machine. Due to high headwinds we had to aim for Melbourne before heading north for Brisbane. Again outside the airlines control. The meals looked ok, same menu, tea coffee and mineral water in good supply. Finally stopped at a very remote gate at Brisbane and a long walk to passport control, the Captain stood at the door and wished us all a good evening on disembarking. Both flights were naturally well supplied with the obligatory screaming babies.

### "My flight was diverted"
Not Verified |  My flight was diverted from landing into Palmerston North to Wellington. The Air New Zealand staff explained before landing that a bus would be waiting for us on arrival to transfer us to Palmerston North but no directions on how to find the bus were given. I asked the staff again when landing with directions but no bus was found. I approached another staff member who gave wrong directions again. No one at anytime took a record of who was requiring a transfer and went with us to the bus. Only when I approached a volunteer did I get any personal help. She went with the group to find the bus no bus, she went to find a shuttle no shuttle and finally got us a taxi. She was great in cold and wet conditions.

### "give you the round about"
Misplaced luggage, no response after sending email - dropped luggage home delivery after 24 hrs. Not bitching about it but TSA snipped my lock. Cost me $45 to repair and ANZ did not have the decency to communicate with me yes or no on refund. Just give you the round about after 3 emails. They tell you: need to contact ANZ SFO, ANZ SFO need to contact ground Staff. Ground Staff - not our job, try NZ Customer service etc. Who the hell then? To this day my email went to a black hole. No customer service gotten back to me - on any answer on the refund repair lock. Yes we will refund, No, we will not refund.

### "sincerely thank the stewardess"
We just had a family holiday to the US via Air New Zealand in economy class. On our return my youngest son didn’t feel well during the flight. As we transfer plane at Auckland airport bound to Perth, he was able to take panadol and an hour of sleep but still didn’t do any help. After a 4 hr stopover, we boarded our flight bound to Perth=. As my son seated in the economy class, he slept curling on his father’s shoulder. Looking at this, I approached one of the Stewardess and requested for vacant seats so my son can lay down and sleep. After my explanation, she led me to 3 vacant seats, and he moved and slept for the flight to Perth. While my son was asleep, I went to check him and saw the 3 seats converted into skycouch (with no extra charge to us). I am very much grateful to Air New Zealand for their sensitivity to its customer’s needs and I would like to sincerely thank the stewardess for giving my son the nice and comfortable acommodation.

### "unorganized staff"
My flight was cancelled due to operational faults or something. I paid 193$ to fly from Auckland to Rotorua. So as soon as the flight got cancelled Air New Zealand sends a text to my cellphone that my flight is cancelled and they can re issue the flight for free. So I go onto their designated link and find out there is a flight on the same day but the link is not letting me book it and I have to be in Rotorua on that day. I rushed to the AIR NZ customer support and was telling them about it and the receptionist was talking on the phone to someone for a while. I was telling her that the link is not letting me book the next flight and after that she's like sorry sir the flight is all booked and the next flight available was the next day. Then I was told that Air NZ is going to arrange a airport transfer bus to Rotorua. I told them that I had back pain and that was the reason I booked a flight. They told me that my only option was to catch the bus. So not having any more choices I boarded the bus. My question is why is an international airline like Air New Zealand have unorganized staff and is the bus fare from Auckland to Rotorua 193$.

### "This airline is hopeless"
After paying for an Air New Zealand flight we were flown by hifly Portugal. We were not told beforehand we would be flying with them, No in-flight entertainment, half a roll for the meal, plane running late, absolutely filthy seating/plane, staff unable to understand clear English and after sending a complaint to the Air New Zealand customer complaints department I received a response that made it obvious they probably had not even read the complaint. When I complained about this to the same person who had obviously not read the complaint, I was told nothing could be done. I just tried to contact Air New Zealand direct but could not get through and am sick of wasting my time. This airline is hopeless, don't waste your valuable time with them! I have flown over 150 flights and this is definitely the worst of them.

### "expecting a whole lot better"
❌ Not Verified |  San Francisco to Auckland. I was expecting a whole lot better, especially as the flight was relatively expensive. Food and beverage service was sub standard, IFE options limited, customer service abrupt and robotic. Saving grace was the seat was quite comfortable. I’ll be flying with another airline next time.

### "disgracefully patronising"
Auckland to Christchurch. Pathetic effort by this low cost carrier. I arrived an hour before departure at Auckland. Three machines would not let me check in because they could not print bag tags. The 3rd one told me to go to the checkin desk - here is one, and there was 36 people queued up. After 20 minutes, with cut off approaching, I went to the special assistance counter. Flustered, I made a mistake putting the tag on (a new style without dots to line up). Then the queue at special assistance had grown - still no staff assisting at the kiosk. Ended up at premium desk with an agent who kept screaming just come and see me I’ll make everything right - disgracefully patronising. There had been a cancellation of the flight so why didn't they deploy other staff to help, rather than taking them from the kiosks.. Finally got on board, sat and waited for over 30 minutes waiting for refuelling - issue 6 hours earlier at Auckland. Once we pulled back, the flight attendant allowed travelling sports people to keep headphones on through the briefing. And later in the flight when they had their feet everywhere on seats, arms of the seats and tray tables the staff did nothing. Dreadful.

### "suggest this is a budget airline"
Auckland to Sydney. Let me start by saying that this airline is by no means the worlds best. The airline charged me $130 for the 1 check in bag that weighed 7kg! The experience at the airport is okay but its obvious that the lounge is now getting a little old, the toilet hygiene is not great and quality and selection of food is very low Once on the plane the you cant actually enjoy a movie without paying $10 which would suggest that this is a budget airline. This was food was only offered at a price and head phones looked as thought they had been recycled since the 90s.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Sydney to Rarotonga. This was by far the worst flight experience with a Star Alliance Carrier so far, especially the cabin crew. We flew Premium Economy. Seats etc. were ok although outdated in regards to comfort which was probably because we flew with an older 777-200ER. However we never experienced such a bad crew: - Safety: they did not show much concern for safety or did everything in a rush. When they prepared the cabin for landing they were in such a rush that they did not even check if we had our seatbelts on. One of the crew members was more busy looking outside the door window to look at the islands. Service: very bad, slow and unfriendly. - Entertainment: best part of the flight, although the volume of announcements during the flight (even safety related) were so low you almost could not hear them which maybe was the reason why we missed a welcome announcement of some sort. - Crew did not care for the passengers or to keep the cabin tidy. Not once in a 5 hour flight they cleaned up the rubbish or asked if we would like to have more drinks. We had to hold on to our used coffee cups and cans even during the landing because they did not prepare the cabin for landing. Towards the end of the flight they served a small breakfast when the pilot informed them to prepare cabin for landing which put them out of concept and put everyone in a rush. This was by far the worst flight in a premium cabin we ever had. It was the first time we flew with this airline and after our return flight it will also be the last time. Compared to other Star Alliance members the difference, especially looking at the crew, is like day and night. Not recommended!

### "it's a pleasant trip"
Auckland to Sydney. The cabin staff are very welcoming and polite,  ready to help those need assistance for the entertaining system etc. Food and beverage service is good, they offer good bubble wine. We were offered priority boarding and meal service for free, and extra leg space with a discount rate, since I booked it by redeeming my Air Canada miles. Anyway, it's a pleasant trip with Air New Zealand.

### "is well worth the fare"
Perth to Buenos Aires via Auckland. Staff are amazing and attentive from booking through to travel, check in easy, premium economy is well worth the fare (if bought at a good time), food and entertainment of prem economy is business class quality. There were some minor hiccups with flight changes/delays but apologetic staff as well as some compensation offered made up for any concerns i had.

### "I won't fly with them again"
London to Auckland via Los Angeles. Uncaring customer support post booking has ensured I won't fly with them again. They take your money and then you are on your own. Such a shame as three/four of our long haul Premium Economy flights were good. Even contacting customer support is very frustrating and once you do you might as well have not bothered. I began to wonder if I were asking questions in a language foreign to them as they never addressed any of them but came back with some stock answer. In the end I gave up and decided just to give them a miss in future.

### "disappointed with this airline"
Napier to Dunedin via Wellington. I am really disappointed with this airline. The flight from wellington was delayed by several hours, we were not even kept in the clear as to why this was the case, i spent hours and hours at the airport receiving delay after delay texts. The fact that I cant even buy a ticket for a friend or partner is also very poorly thought through. I bought a ticket for my partner as a surprise and had it emailed to me but now due to Air New Zealand taking it upon themselves to monitor Facebook sites like NZ flight swap, they flag down people on flights where there has been a swap or sale monitored, and flag down people, refusing to let them on the plane. At least let people who have paid for your service and bought this seat, give the ticket to someone, if they can't themselves make it or if it was a present. Monitoring these seats and not letting people on is in my opinion ridiculous. Why wouldn't you allow a service like a name change? Allowing us to pay a fee of perhaps $20 to change the name on the ticket so that you can still use the flight? The only good this about this airline at the moment is the cookies and the coffee they offer on the flight. Flights from Dunedin to Napier are more expensive than flying to the gold coast for a week. are you serious.

### "leg room was enough"
Auckland to Christchurch. A320 economy class was almost full. Self check in and self drop off luggage were convenient and fast. The meal was very simple, just a cup of coffee and one cookie. The leg room was enough, so it made me comfortable.

### "an excellent product"
Auckland - Melbourne in Premium Economy. Air New Zealand Premium Economy is an excellent product, the seats were comfortable with generous legroom. The meal service was business class standard and the cabin crew exemplified the usual friendly Kiwi service we have come to expect with Air NZ.

### "SkyCouch useless as a bed"
My wife and I flew SkyCouch Houston to Auckland on February 2 and Auckland to Houston Feb 23. It is worth the USD 600 paid to have an empty middle seat, but the three seats are near useless as a lie-down bed for a normal size adult. For two adults side-by-side, it’s almost impossible. On two flights nobody on our plane tried to use SkyCouch as a bed. I suffer from chronic leg cramps and excruciating muscle spasms in my legs [if not stretched every hour or so]. Not to mention the possibility of pulmonary vein thrombosis in a 73-yr-old person such as myself. I did have one episode of a terrible muscle spasm, which necessitated me having to unbuckle my seat belt and stand up to put weight on my leg to relieve the spasm. Luckily, the flight was smooth at the time and no flight attendant had to order me to sit down [without regard to the severe pain that would cause me]. However, as I was stretching my leg and walking to a restroom, an attendant told me I needed to return to my seat when the captain activated the fasten seat belt sign. I’m a veteran traveler and know it is almost impossible to have a rational discussion with a flight attendant following airline rules and guidelines and will not or cannot make exceptions no matter how much pain and discomfort a passenger might endure. Nonetheless, I did take a moment to explain my difficult situation to the young stewardess, who probably could not imagine my 73-yr-old condition. Of course, she showed no sensitivity or understanding whatsoever, and told me - in a tone which indicated she thought I may have been senile - that I might bump my head in rough air if I were not seated and secured with a fastened seat belt. The fact that may have caused me excruciating pain did not register at all with her. She could have cared less. In such a situation the risk to my safety and good health was far worse if I were seated and buckled-in than if I were allowed to stand for a few minutes until the spasm passed and the pain lessened. I doubt that this review will result in a more tolerant and enlightened approach by ANZ [or any other alrilnes’ flight attendants], but I hope this description of my situation on NZ28 [departure from AKL on Feb 23] might result in attendants having a more open-minded approach to dealing with a passenger’s medical issue. But I sincerely doubt it. On a non-medical issue, how about ANZ joining the 21st century and providing satelite WiFi with Internet on the IAH-AKL route?

### "limits the length of the name"
Nelson to Auckland. Air New Zealand has a serious problem with the online booking in that it limits the number of characters of the name to 28. They say it is a legal requirement of international aviation, which I know is not the case as I book online and travel internationally with many different airlines, and no other airline limits the length of the name! This problem has caused hours of head-ache for myself and everyone in my extended family and I’m sure other people with long names. I have sent emails to the 'top’ of Air NZ and no-one is listening. They keep repeating the same old story about 'it's a legal requirement to limit the name to 28 characters’. Sadly I made the mistake of booking a flight again this May with Air New Zealand flying co-share on Singapore Airlines, but I'm told by Singapore Airlines they cannot issue a ticket and cannot guarantee that I can board the flight, because my name is not correct! I've called Air New Zealand 3 times with very long phone queues at $1 a minute from Cuba where I live and they say they can't do anything about it. The computer won't allow them to add all the letters in my passport! So now I am left with a ticket on Singapore Airlines that I don’t know I can use on the day of the flight, because Air New Zealand prejudices against people with long names under the premise that it is aviation law. And do they care about this annoying complaint from a small section of their customers, probably not. I chose AirNZ because I am a Kiwi and I wish to remain loyal to my country but I'm seriously regretting my decision.

### "Exceptional service"
Exceptional service - the business class cabin is superbly laid out matched by friendly considered service, sublime entertainment IFE and great menu and offer befitting this short hop from Auckland to Melbourne. Well done Air New Zealand on getting this just right. Thank you for the upgrade from Premium to Business.

### "I came away impressed"
First time on Premium Economy with New Zealand on a long-haul flight from Auckland to Houston, and I came away impressed. It was by far the best Premium Economy-Experience that I have had. The seat was a very comfortable recliner seat with generous legroom and recline. The legroom on NZ is noticeably greater than on most other carriers with PE. Furthermore, all seats have a leg-rest. The inflight service was comparable to Business Class service. The quality of the food was excellent, and the service very friendly and attentive.

### "used to be really good"
Flew Sydney to Auckland. Air New Zealand used to be really good. Apparently they are using Hifly now. Worst experience ever! Aircraft wasn't clean. TV control was sticky probably from previous passenger lollies. Crew were really unfriendly and strange. They spilt water on me twice and another occasion beer. No apology at all and when I asked for something to clean my shirt they said it was already dry!

### "will not fly my national carrier again"
I booked an Air New Zealand flight from Auckland to Sydney and they have code shared it with Virgin Australia, but you cannot check in with ANZ. They haven’t even got matching booking numbers, so you can’t check-in online either. But, to change flights they double charge the change fee. One for Air New Zealand and one for Virgin Australia. I haven’t flown ANZ for a while after poor service before and will not fly my national carrier again.

### "adequate seat space, good service"
Los Angeles - Auckland return in economy. Both flights on time, adequate seat space, good service. Open bar throughout the flight, you can place orders on the touch screen at your seat. Vast catalogue of movies. Some problems with collecting empty food trays/plastic cups: very long wait on the flight to AKL and no collection of cups on the return flight. Another inconvenience was on the way back: they were unable to check the luggage through to final destination with connecting flight on Air Canada. However, onward Air Canada was able to check the luggage through to Auckland with Air NZ.

### "friendly and helpful"
Auckland to Hong Kong. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. They offered drinks and snacks throughout the flight. Toilets were maintained and I was  impressed with the IFE. There was a wide selection of movies and TV shows as well as radio channels. I appreciated the seat chat function as my companion and I were seated apart during the flight. I also like generous leg space of the cabin.

### "seats are uncomfortable"
Hong Kong to Auckland. The food was ok, the entertainment was good and the service was fine. This was in a Boeing 777 aircraft with a 3x4x3 seating arrangement. In my opinion the B777 is too narrow for 10 seats abreast. The seats and isle are too narrow. The seats are uncomfortable and if you sit by the isle you will be subjected to constant banging of passengers and staff walking past. The narrow isle is a difficult working environment for staff and it must pose a hazard should the aircraft need to be evacuated.

### "The worst business class"
Auckland to Tokyo. The worst business class I have come across in the last 10 years. You sit with the back to the window (!) your legs stick out into the aisle (so that the staff run over your feet all the time), there is a separation sheet on your left and on your right and the space in between is less than in economy, so you feel like lying in a coffin. Noarmrest for your left arm (which hangs in the air the whole flight). Food mediocre, wines exclusively from NZ, no newspapers or magazines (except for one local Auckland paper). Stay away and fly other airlines!

### "no apology, not happy"
Buenos Aires to Brisbane via Auckland. Booked a skycouch, we have flown Air New Zealand before normally very reliable, on departure No skycouch, just a surly Stewardess, refund voucher slapped on seat whilst sleeping. We received refund, but no apology, not happy, would consider never flying with them again.

### "didn’t fail to deliver"
After calling the very efficient Air NZ call centre, they advised me to book on NZ2, AKL/LAX on 23 December as I would be able to get a recognition upgrade cleared and I could move from the Premium Economy cabin to Business Class. The crew in the Business Class cabin didn’t fail to deliver and it is the small details that make this airline stand out. The staff remembered customer’s names without having to refer to a passenger manifest. They also remembered drink choices and provided regular top ups. As I am a dessert freak, they offered me a second and a third dessert which I accepted without hesitation. After dinner I went to the bathroom and came back to find my bed had been made up for me. The bed is very good too and the mattress topper makes all the difference. All through the night the staff move quietly throughout the cabin and if you are awake, they are willing to bring you a hot or cold drink or some snacks. The new amenity packs are a vast improvement too. All in all, this was a very good flight and the level of service from the crew was stellar.

### "One word for it: Misery"
We were booked on the NZ 5341, Wellington to Christchurch at 09.05 in the morning on 26 November 2017. At the airport there was no check-in service, only machines. Not very passenger friendly. We are not used to that, you should have a choice, specially when you are over a certain age. After some time a New Zealand staff member came along. Tried to help us with the machine, nothing worked. We were not happy to say the least. Then the NZ staff member found out that the 09.05 flight was cancelled! Nobody had contacted us about this. NZ did not seem to care. The trouble was that we had made arrangements in Christchurch. We were booked on NZ 6151 some hours later. We had to tag our bags and bring them to the belt. One word for it: Misery. This was the first time with Air New Zealand. We heard it was a top airline. It is not. It is a Do It Yourself Airline, and not cheap. Flying was ok, plane was fine. No coffee or tea, only some water. Stingy. Please bring back live persons to check in! Be more friendly to your customers!

### "no one at the bag drop"
Auckland to Queenstown. Late flight departure at 6am but there is no one at the bag drop counter until 5.30am (where last bag drop supposed to end at 530am). Poor system customers were waiting anxiously to queue for bag drop, staff unable to response to customer's general inquiry, (no one at the counter).

### "I found them arrogant, rude"
Singapore to Auckland return. We were very excited to finally find an afforable Air New Zealand fare from London to Auckland in December for a family of four. We flew Singapore Airlines from London to Singapore and then Air New Zealand  to Auckland. I haven't flown Air New Zealand since 2001 as I found them disappointing then. But having heard that they have won awards for various categories I wanted to give them another go for our once in a few years family holiday back to NZ. I found them arrogant, rude and completely lacking in the sensational customer service I know and look forward to in and around New Zealand. On our return flight from Auckland to Singapore 80% of the flight we had the seat belt sign on for turbulence. This is a 9 plus hour flight and staff were quick and blunt to tell passengers to return to their seats when they got up to use the loo. I understand the need for measures to keep passengers safe during periods of expected turbulence but completely unrealistic to pressure people to "hold on" for extended periods of time. They even told us that we couldn't take our 6 year old to the toilet and implied if she wet herself then not to worry as the seats can be cleaned on arrival? Don't even get me started on the uniforms, utterly horrendous. Tray tables were also disgustingly dirty. The likes of Singapore and Emirates win hands down in terms of air steward/stewardess class and service. I will not be wasting my money on air New Zealand again. Far better options out there

### "experience left me disappointed"
Hong Kong to Auckland. As a proud Kiwi I was excited about flying Air NZ again returning home from London to NZ for Christmas. The call centre team  was very good. After flying the London to HK route on Cathay Pacific with exceptional service, I was expecting Air NZ to be next level - oh how wrong I was wrong! First off, the seat was horrible, almost like the padding on your back had worn down to metal, the only way to stay comfy was with a pillow behind your back. Then comes the inflight staff! Served by the worst attendant I have ever experienced. Completely rude, barking orders at anyone who didn’t comply – quite shocking. All in all the Air NZ experience left me disappointed, after having such high expectations, I certainly wont be choosing them again over the vast options when flying London to NZ again.

### "Decent domestic flight"
Christchurch to Auckland. Having my last day on the South Island, I arrived Christchurch Airport around an hour from departure. The self-check-in and baggage service was decent, at least I have not seen any from Hong Kong. Although the plane was a bit delayed a bit for boarding, it's fine for me to wait a while. They gave passengers a printed sheet as the boarding pass which I felt a bit confused because I have my iPhone stored with the boarding pass. The seat was okay, far enough legroom for me. Interestingly, they put those magazines hanger on the top of the seat which is quite good, at least passengers would less likely throw their rubbish into the hanger. Both take-off and landing were smooth, and I like those purple LED lights during those times. Everything is smooth, comfy. Decent domestic flight for me.

### "The crew was friendly"
Apia to Auckland. It is  a pleasure to fly with this airline. The aircraft made a newer, clean and modern impression. The crew was friendly, had time for small talk and was extremely helpful. The on-board catering met higher standards and drinks were served several times and in sufficient quantities. A large number of films and music rounded off this very good flight. No questions, the flight was in time.

### "seats are so tight"
Auckland to Los Angeles. I have three issues with this operation. First of all, in the departure lounge, they had two gates line up in a queue that had to be 100 meters long, and at no time was anyone in the queue fully confidant that they were in the correct one, also no one was advising us as to what was going on. Secondly, they went and changed our already selected seat assignments which were two aisle seats to an aisle and a center seat. Thirdly, these seats are by far the most uncomfortable seats on any aircraft that I've flown for more than an hour. The seats are so tight that it's a joke, also the leg room is almost non-existent. The seating on Ryanair that I flew a while back was vastly superior. In addition to the above, I was totally unable to eat the meal they provided as the seat back of the person in front of you restricts access to it, that was probably a blessing for me as the meal looked as though it would not be good for you. Would certainly not recommend sitting on this airline to anyone, unless it was an emergency.

### "notice all the places they cut costs"
Sydney to Queenstown. Air New Zealand might be a decent airline if they went full-service instead of budget. Their staff and admin are fine, check in was very fast and staff are generally nice. The seats in the plane were a striking black and they were thicker and comfier than most budget airlines, but then you notice all the places they cut costs. The rest of the fit out shook terribly and was probably very cheap. I knew my ticket didn’t include food but I didn’t know they’d want me to pay $10 to watch a movie (on a trans-Tasman flight, you’ll only be able to watch one movie). They use remote stands at Sydney airport, which also involve the most crowded and disorganised gates. A notable issue was that all of the cabin crew were overweight, with two of them so wide that they could not walk down the aisle without bumping into passengers - I was in an aisle seat and did not appreciate this. On the outbound leg, they were cheaper than Qantas, but on the return they were the same price, so I’m very happy that I booked Qantas for the return.

### "it was utterly underwhelming"
Christchurch to Sydney return in Works Deluxe. Both flights departed on time and both arrived early. Outbound flight all promised elements provided. Wine quality was pretty hideous. No second round of drinks offered. Beef casserole was tasteless and very small. Bag arrived promptly. In bound flight-no premium check-in provided, again chose the beef casserole - again, very small and tasteless; again wine selection poor. CSM sought out elite members and made nice with them, ignored other passengers (this is standard in my experience on Air New Zealand). Bag very slow in appearing. On the whole, for their premium product on A320 it was utterly underwhelming. Just as well that I was paying with APD.

### "definitely punches above its weight"
I was very eager to try Air New Zealand during my recent trip to Tahiti. It was my first time in their Premiim Economy cabin. A flight attendant introduced herself to passengers on board and explained the features on the seat. Meal service was done business class style - the entree and dessert are served on a tray and the main course followed. The seat was upholstered with leather and had a very good recline and pitch. I was very impressed by the cheerfulness and enthusiasm of the flight attendants on board. Despite the AKL-PPT-AKL turnaround route being a tiring long red-eye flight, they remained at their very best throughout the 5-hour flight attending to and anticipating passengers’ needs. At Auckland Airport, Premium Economy passengers had a dedicated check-in lounge shared with business class. Luggage was tagged as priority and priority boarding was also accorded to Premium Economy passengers. Air New Zealand’s Premium Economy product definitely punches above its weight.

### "Couldn't have been happier"
Despite reserving this flight from Melbourne to Christchurch via Virgin I got the code-share equivalent of Air NZ's "The Works". Couldn't have been happier! It placed me on seat 1D and the service was one of the most caring and generous: Flight attendant helped me to raise the IFE screen whenever they saw me trying They even reserved overhead locker space for my row's bags They even wanted to help me put my case into it. Every 20min a flight attendant would ask if anyone needs water. The only regrets were narrow the seat width and seat pocket. Also disconcerting was the frequent turbulence - descent was rough.

### "extremely friendly and accommodating"
Long-haul flight with Air New Zealand from Auckland to Singapore. The plane was new and the cabin interior appealing. The seat was comfortable, which allowed me to get some sleep. The cabin staff were – as always with Air NZ – extremely friendly and accommodating. I had ordered a Vegetarian special meal, and the food was very tasty, even though the quantity was rather limited. Furthermore, Air NZ did not offer a bar during the flight, which I found rather unusual for such a long distance. Overall, however, it was a pleasant experience.

### "Very poor experience"
Very poor experience on a flight from Sydney to Auckland. The flight was scheduled to arrive on Sunday, shortly before midnight; we actually arrived on Monday night at around 7.30pm with an almost 20-hour delay. The positive side was that the airline personnel was always friendly despite the situation. The negative side was the underwhelming information policy. We were informed about the cancellation of the flight at around 10pm after having spent almost six hours at the airport even though the reasons for the cancellation (late incoming flight because of technical difficulties, impossibility to return because of nighttime curfew at Sydney airport) should have been clear much earlier. After several instances of queuing, we were checked in at the hotel, which the airline provided to us, by 1AM. The buses picked us up the next morning at 7AM. We had been told that the flight would leave at 10.30AM. When we arrived at the airport, we were told that the flight would not leave before 11.40AM, which was gradually pushed back for incomprehensible reasons to 2.30pm. People were often waiting at the gate at the (newly) announced boarding time, without anything happening and without getting any information about the further delay. It seems that Air New Zealand really needs to work on their protocol in such situations. That you have delays because of technical difficulties happens now and then, but I never had a similarly disorganised experience in the past.

### "better than I had expected"
Wellington to Sydney. They have very good flight time at 10:15 am which arrives at noon in Sydney. The best part is what they called Work Deluxe, which is more like a premium economy on other airlines. The small single-aisled air craft has 3x3 seating and no business class. Work + Bag and Work deluxe is almost like their "Business class", with the front 3 rows of seats used for that, with a middle seat blocked (guaranteed) to create a bit more space between passengers. For work deluxe they give bottled water, noise canceling headphone, landing form with free pen, a free meal, free drinks including alcohol. Priority baggage and brooding too. I find the whole thing even better than I had expected, the service was great too! I had a problem with self check-in, the staffs at the airport were very helpful and courteous. One would have to pay premium price , easily 3 times more that what I had paid, to get that on their competitors like Qantas, which only uses a small 737, but they do have a business class installed. I really see a lot of value for money here, as confirmed by my seat mate, who is a regular on that route.

### "Last time with Air NZ"
Auckland to Christchurch. Air NZ shares code with Singapore Airlines and even for a combined itenery Air Nz is too lazy to pass the check in baggage with partner airlines. I had to manually take my check in luggage and check in again on my further way to Singapore with just layover time of 1.5 hr. On top of it, Air NZ staff at Auckland reception desk at domestic terminal is too blunt and rude that I have done a mistake by buying Air NZ ticket. She told me that if I will show attitute then she would call her boss, while I just got frustrated, attitude is a word when you raise your voice and start getting angry. she has more power like she was suffering there. Ugly and useless people are hired by Air Nz in customer service like answering prisoners committing crime buyong their ticket. Last time with Air NZ, better is even Jetstar.

### "Crew were extremely friendly"
Flew Wellington to Hong Kong via Auckland. Due to the Auckland airport fuel crisis (damaged pipes) the plane had to stopover in Australia to refuel fully (as many other airlines did). During the stopover which delayed the flight about 45 minutes on arrival the crew were very good, constantly offering water, coffee, tea and light snacks as we were not allowed to exit the aircraft. In the air the meal options were very good and were good for both majorities on board (Hong Kong Citizens and New Zealand Citizens) with Asian and European style meals available to suit everybody. The inflight entertainment was good, but it was still the same from when I flew to Sydney in April and July, making it hard to find something I would like that I hadn't already watched. Boarding was prompt and everything was done in an orderly fashion. Crew were extremely friendly and did their absolute best to make sure everybody was seen to in the entire flight. Would definitely recommend Air New Zealand for long haul travel.

### "gives the experience a low-cost feel"
Light and shadow on this Air New Zealand flight from Auckland to Melbourne. The outbound trip was on a B77W, the inbound trip on an A320. Like many airlines today, Air New Zealand offers different fare options where you either have only carry-on luggage, a checked bag or checked-bag, meals and movies. I chose the basic option without even a checked bag. You still get a decent amount of free water, tea and coffee on the flight and can make use of the non-movie part of the IFE, in particular their great music selection. One further downside of the two most basic fare options is that Air NZ requires you to pay for choosing your seat even at check-in, which gives the experience a low-cost feel. If you do not pay, the system chooses a seat for you. The seat pitch on the B777 was decent, the pitch on the A320 very tight for a 3 1/2 hours flight. At least, I was lucky that I had an aisle seat on the latter flight. One element that was consistently excellent throughout the two flights was the service of the cabin crew.

### "never fly Air New Zealand again"
Los Angeles to London return. Paid extra for the Premium Economy seats. When boarded appalled that had to turn sideways down the aisle. From a safety standpoint I don't know how this is allowed, because in an emergency there is no room for rendering medical aid or even to evacuate properly. The aisle narrowness also proved a problem later when I tried to sleep (I am a thin lady and don't spill over seat sides) and I was constantly banged into by crew and passengers going down the aisle. The seats are narrow and uncomfortable, the premium seats have a leg rest below the seat that lifts up and provides no comfort other than take away more space and leg room. These seats would only work if there are two family members of small stature seated in the three seat row by themselves otherwise they are useless. As it was my knees were up against the front seat and if the passenger in front reclines their seat you can't eat off your tray and well you feel crushed. On the flight back my seat recline button was broken and I couldn't sleep. The passenger in front of my mother reclined their seat after they had served coffee and it went all over her clothes and ruined them. I have been on budget flights such as Ryan Air and been more comfortable. This is unacceptable for a long haul flight costing as much or more than other airlines in this category. I flew Air New Zealand 7 years ago and it was the best airline I had ever flown and recommended them to everyone. It was the only reason I chose them again and I wish I read the reviews on this site before booking them over Virgin Atlantic or British Airways. I will never fly Air New Zealand again or recommend them to anyone. Look at the photos I have attached and you can see for yourself. I feel sorry for the crew having to work in such cramped quarters and especially for the passengers who were continuing on to Auckland. Oh and there is a feature on the inflight entertainment that allows you to order snacks drinks from your seat. This feature was only ever activated for a period of 30 minutes on each flight. I think this was done on purpose by the flight attendants due to having to navigate up and down those ridiculous aisles. Shame on you Air New Zealand. How far you have fallen from the top.

### "All in all a great flight"
Brisbane to Auckland. This flight was short due to the strong tail wind, 2 hours 20 minutes. The food and wine were so good you wanted the flight to be longer. We were the last to check in, the staff member at check in was Ok but basically looked like he wanted the experience to be over. Lounge in BNE was fine but morning tea type food so didn't eat anything. On board the service was great, very personal from the first moment on board. The wine selection was superb and the meal itself really enjoyable. Didn't use IFE other than to listen to music on take off and landing but looked fine. Bags were about a 3 minute wait on arrival at AKL. A long queue to depart customs but were still in a cab before the original time that the plane was due to land. All in all a great flight.

### "find the crew very engaging, hospitable and friendly"
Auckland to Sydney with Air New Zealand. The trip started off with the Premium Check In area, which did not seem premium in any way because all I saw was the Ground Crew just directing people, not actually checking passengers into their flights. After the security, I gave the Lounge a visit and enjoyed breakfast. Boarding time did not match the boarding pass, with priority boarding not enforced which meant passengers were all over the place. A very warm welcome by the Cabin Crew once onboard with a welcome drink on offer straight away. I decided to have a second breakfast once airborne and the food selection was very good. From what I observed, I find the crew very engaging, hospitable and friendly which was a big difference from my recent trips with Virgin and Qantas. The flight had slight turbulence, with a smooth landing into Sydney. Looking forward to another trip with this great airline.

### "friendly crew were great"
Great flying by fine pilots - no turbulence / bumpiness felt at all till descent. IFE amazing - great music lists and other interesting stuff. Having USB charger plus spacious seat pocket and traditional remote control is great. Old plane but interior refurbishment made it sparkle. Overall very clean - bathroom more spacious than other airlines and even had sprayed scents! Friendly crew were great.

### "how bare-bones they are now"
I first flew on Air New Zealand in 1986 when I moved to New Zealand. I do not expect the service and amenities to be the same now as then but am disappointed on how bare-bones they are now. For instance: on a 14+ hour flight from Auckland to Houston there is no snack, beverage or even water served until the meal about two hours into the flight. I know snacks are not about nourishment but to alleviate boredom and make it seem as though something is happening. I can't verify it but I'm sure the meal trays are shrinking. Dinner, while usually good, was appalling. Some sort of mystery chicken chunks with a spicy sauce and rice. Breakfast (I chose the fruit option) was only one muffin, one container of yoghurt and a measly fruit plate including—in the height of the USA's growing season—two slices of canned peaches! That was it as far as food went. I did go to the galley to get a cookie in the night. During the long night a flight attendant came by with water only once. I have restless legs and don't sleep for more than an hour or two at a time and even then very lightly so it wasn't that I missed the water coming around. That was okay with me though as I brought my own 2 liters of water as I won't drink water stored in tanks on aircraft's. I've flown round trip on a Air New Zealand long haul flights on average twice every three years for thirty years. My previous flight to the US was on American Airlines in May 2017, also in economy. I wasn't expecting much but was happily surprised. They still gave out hot towels after takeoff and one other time (I forgot when, maybe before breakfast) they also gave out snacks and a beverage after takeoff and all water was from sealed water bottles. They had lots of different snacks in the galley during the night, not just small Cookie Time cookies and some sort of chips. I still like Air New Zealand for domestic flights and will fly with them if the price is right. I tried to "one up" to premium economy but my bid wasn't high enough. I feel it is a safe airline and that's the most important thing but 14+ hours is a long time. The in seat entertainment is great, I watched four movies as well as reading an e-book. I gave a 4 rating for value for money because safety is the most important thing and crew were pleasant.

### "cancelled with no prior notice"
Christchurch to Wellington. As a New Zealand Citizen I can say I have zero bias in this topic. My last flight with Air NZ was cancelled with no prior email notice and resulted in me having to wait a number of hours for the next flight. It was a small 2:2 domestic flight (around 1 hour air time) leaving on a clear night however cancelled without notice. When I asked the ticket staff they were unable to give me a reason as to why the flight was cancelled. This is purely theory however It is likely that they cancelled the earlier flight due to the fact that the passengers of my original flight and of the one I ended up taking could have fit in one plane. Although this is a smart business decision (cutting costs for the same gain) it is a betrayal of customer trust and time. Not only was I not given a reson for the cancel but was too given no notification of it until reaching the airport. To top off the night the plane I was switched to ended up leaving atleast 20 min late. All this in comparison to the fact that it was a simple domestic flight is disappointing.

### "the staff acting blunt and rude"
Noumea to Napier via Auckland. Paid an extra $350.00 for movies on the plane and one food option - says drinks provided but only get two, probably a total value of $35.00. Landed in Auckland and Napier flight cancelled due to an engineering problem and have to wait 13 hours for another flight. 2 flights were cancelled at the same time due to weather issues, why would you not use one of these planes to fly to Napier instead? All in all a disappointing experience with the staff acting blunt and rude to the customers I saw in line and myself rather then sorry and genuine.

### "ground based care is shameful"
Auckland to Hi Chi Minh City. I fly with Air New Zealand a lot. The more I fly the less they care. I am not getting my star alliance status points. And have spent many hours on the phone. Why does this matter. I should be gold. But have been denied this. I paid for koru to get the status I should have. But am still not getting the status. Or even the perks I have paid for. 800 bucks still not getting lounge access or priority boarding or priority luggage. The call centre actually makes me suicidal. This is not a joke. The ground based care is shameful.

### "their standards have slipped"
Sydney to Los Angeles via Auckland. Having flown to the US a few times with Air New Zealand, it is unfortunate to see that their standards have slipped and service is inconsistent. Overall the experience in Business Premier was acceptable considering the special price I booked. I used to recommend the airline but I would be less enthusiastic to recommend Air NZ if paying full price for Business or if flying in economy. The check-in at Sydney Airport was absolutely appalling, the whole experience took 40 minutes and after waiting 15 minutes in the priority line I was rudely told to go back to the automatic check-in machines, despite other passengers in the business check-in being served at the counter. The check-in machines didn't work properly (which is why I went straight to the counter), so a staff member had to be located to do it for me, then I had to drag the bags back to the check-in counter to stand in line again for another 15 minutes at least. I understand this is the process when flying in economy, but this fell so short of the mark for business it wasn't funny, and the different treatment for other (older) customers was insulting. When I did eventually manage to get to the lounge in Sydney, the barista service was nice, I was able to find a seat and the choice of food was good. However I preferred the vastly superior views at the old lounge (before they renovated about 3 years ago I think). The Business Premier seats on the 777s are comfortable and I find the bed excellent. The meal service overall was fine. I prefer to dine in the lounge instead and only eat lightly on the flight. I recommend taking the Peter Gordon dining options where offered, or having the cold appetizer or soup (which they always seem to have) as those are the most reliable. The breakfast smoothies are also consistently excellent. I had waffles for breakfast and that was also good. On the return flight from San Francisco to Auckland, I found the menu options a bit unappetizing. Usually I have the fast dine option, but it was a creamy cauliflower soup which is not what I wanted, so I ended up with three courses of a cold Gazpacho soup (good), chicken main (average) and lemon shortcake dessert (average). The hot breakfast options were eggs or pancakes which I didn't bother with, I just had the continental breakfast of a smoothie then fruit and yoghurt, all of which was fine. Having taken this route with Air NZ a few times both on the old 747s and the 777s, unfortunately it is noticeable how much noisier the 777s are. Even with noise cancelling headphones, the noise was annoying on the return flight and it reduced my sleep time. The 300s are marginally quieter than the 200s but compared to being at the front of a 747 or an A380s it is loud. If you are flying to LA the 787s would be great, but the San Francisco flights are on 777s. Air NZ use the Singapore Airlines lounge at SFO. I understand it's the best of an average bunch and the only one with airside showers apart from United First. Food options in the lounge were quite good. If you want to use the showers, make sure you get in quick as they had a total of four towels and couldn't be bothered to get any in until the next Singapore flight after the Air NZ one had left, very poor service. I had to buy a towel at the airport as a result. You also have to ask them to unlock the showers, what a pain. Singapore staff asked us to leave 5 minutes after boarding was called, and they shut the lounge to clean it for their flight.

### "couldn't pay by my airpoints"
Auckland to Nadi on June 27th. The economy class was almost full. My Seat was 41D. My fare did not include the meal. The PTV system mentioned that I could use airpoints to buy any food, but when I bought a cola by the PTV system, I couldn't pay by my airpoints. Staff came to help me, but they also had no way to deal with this problem..

### "plying passengers with booze"
San Francisco to Perth via Auckland. My wife and I have traveled extensively in first and business class and decided to fly to the USA from Perth via Auckland with Air New Zealand. Normally we would travel through Singapore, but since we had not been to NZ before, we decided to route via Auckland. The herring bone seating arrangement made it very difficult to look out the window and so you spend a lot of time looking inward at fellow passengers, who are looking at you. However, once the bed was down and you were sleeping, this was no longer a problem. But, this is when another disadvantage of this close racked seating became more apparent, the unpleasant smells vented by nearby passengers had you reaching for the air ventilation nozzle, unfortunately this does not exist on the 787. The food was probably down with the worst we have experienced, but the cabin staff did their best to offset this by plying passengers with booze, it seemed their mantra was a drunk passenger was a happy passenger. In any small group, there are always a couple who lack the restraint to drink in moderation, further adding to the discomfort of fellow travelers.

### "few passengers on the plane"
Auckland to Sydney by on June 11th. It was my first time to flew with Air New Zealand. It was friendly and fast that checked in and dropped baggage by the automachine. My seat was 52A, there were very few passengers on the plane, so I could occupy three seats. My ticket fare was not include the meal, but I bought some food onboard. The crew were helpful and friendly.

### "Worst flight ever"
Singapore to Auckland. Worst flight ever - filthy toilets, terrible food. When complained to Air Stewardess about these issues was offered a gin and tonic. What sort of a response is that. I had medication that needed to be kept cold, was offered a bag of ice to wrap around it. Consequently the ice melted and I had to throw out medication as it became very wet - not impressed. Other airlines have a fridge for medication. Offered water twice only on a 10 hour flight. Will not be travelling on Aiz NZ anytime soon.

### "slick and professional operation"
I haven't flown Air New Zealand for some years and was pleasantly surprised by the premium economy product on offer flying from Singapore to Auckland. The service was excellent as was the food and ground handling. Small closed of cabin 21 PAX with own toilet. 2 dedicated flight attendants who were constantly around the cabin. Snacks can be ordered from seat screen. A totally slick and professional operation theat Air NZ should be proud of.

### "all flights were a dream"
Excellent family trip. Travelling with 2 children - aged 4 years and 7 months on a long haul flight - Melbourne - Auckland - San Francisco. Bulkhead row with baby basinet. Expecting a challenging trip with small children, all flights were a dream. Service was excellent from all on board and a great aircraft. Couldn't fault anything, staff were very helpful, food was good, entertainment options were great. Value for money was incredible - less than AU$900 each for 3 seats, and including a basinet for bubs.

### "seats were absolutely fine"
Returned to Auckland from a holiday in Honolulu with my wife after flying Air New Zealand to Honolulu 10 days before, also on Air NZ. Both flights in Economy and both travelling on a Works (full service) ticket. Flight up was an overnight flight and the flight back was a day flight. Despite other reviews seats were absolutely fine, I slept about 4 hrs on a 8.5 hr flight up and my wife got at least that. Didn't sleep on the flight back and the seats were fine on the 9 hr return flight. My wife and I are average to smaller stature so perhaps that helped. Service on both flights was very good, lots of walkthroughs with water and decent meals. Service was usual Air NZ, ie friendly with a Kiwi flavour. AV was quite good as well. We went up in June and came back in July and noticed the July movie list seemed a bit more interesting, tho that is personal taste. One thing I really liked was that I didn't need an aircraft adapter, the Air NZ 787 has a single pin headphone socket as well as the aircraft double socket. In summary, very satisfied with both lights (and I'm not an Air NZ fanboi) .

### "they have friendly service"
Vancouver to Auckland. I have had six international flights in last month with them in business class and they are working hard at improving their premium product. I still don't think there are up to the standard of Asian airlines but they have friendly service, excellent food and beverage and very comfortable beds (I think the seats work better as beds than seats). I was lucky enough to have a very attentive flight attendant on the Vancouver to Auckland leg, he offered me a New Zealand newspaper (he had kept some out of sight) which was much appreciated. He also made up the empty seat next to me as a bed. Flight  arrived on time, dinner and breakfast were excellent, bathrooms clean and no queuing. The IFE is a bit ordinary, they need to do better here, on Emirates there are hundreds more titles, if not thousands.

### "service not up to usual standards"
Flew Air New Zealand from Los Angeles to London Heathrow. Check in friendly and fast, security line for Business class not too bad. Lounge was OK, only had a glass of wine but food looked tasty. Flight was delayed 30 minutes, check in was chaotic. On board in second cabin for Business Class did not appear to be as well attended as the main cabin and had to wait until the doors had closed for a pre takeoff wine while I could see in the main cabin they were having refills. Magazines only offered in main cabin. This is due to economy and premium economy passengers boarding via the second business class cabin space. British crew were a bit perfunctory, level of attention to detail was not particularly personal. First meal of blackened chicken with kale and pumpkin mash was adequate, breakfast undercooked and not edible (e.g. raw potato). Was not asked if there was anything wrong with is despite it being barely touched. Wine excellent, seat and bed very comfortable, best thing to do on the flight was to sleep. IFE was fine and being able to watch to the gate was appreciated so that I could finish a film. Bags there before we were and surprisingly in a cab within 30 minutes of an on time arrival feeling well rested but overall service was not up to usual standards.

### "seats were comfortable"
Tokyo-Auckland return. The out-going trip was excellent - one of the best I've had in economy class. Incredibly attentive, friendly, proactive crew. If they saw our water bottles were empty, they offered to refill them, and as we were sitting near the galley where some passengers were congregating, they offered us noise-cancelling earphones from Business Class. I love that Air NZ offers five quality wines, and that with breakfast on both legs they served Sparkling Wine. Food, service and IFE was great. On the return trip, it was good but lacked any spark. Crew tended to be going through the motions, and the food was very average - which was surprising given it departed from Auckland. But the wine and IFE made up for it, and the seats were comfortable and the legroom was spacious.

### "perfect service all the way"
Air New Zealand were fabulous. From the time you get to the gate (could not rate check in as we had a connnecting flight with AC before Vancouver) to the arrival in Auckland: perfect service all the way. The ground personnel and flight attendants are polite, attentive, empathic. Air NZ even has wine expert in economy class onboard. Although the flight is very long, service was so smooth and well done that it went quickly. We were booked on a codeshare with United on the way back: absolutely terrible. Whenever possible I will travel Air New Zealand.

### "was as good as business class gets"
Check in was fine, no time for the lounge at Brisbane. The first sector was perfect, wonderful crew, great food and wine. Called by name by all crew including inflight service manager on departure. Auckland lounge was full and had plenty of food and drink variety. SFO flight left on time and arrived early. Crew not as warm as previous however food and wine was better than most restaurants. Meals were surprisingly good, especially the Michael Meredith designed menu items. Bed was extremely comfortable. IFE good. Overall was as good as business class gets, was in a cab leaving SFO airport within 30 minutes of landing and 15 minutes ahead of scheduled arrival. Other than the second crew being more jaded than the first this was as good as any business class that we have ever flown on.

### "from boarding to disembarking - exceptional"
On my flight from London to Auckland via Los Angeles from boarding to disembarking Air New Zealand are exceptional. The fantastic welcome and genuine care and attention from the team onboard really make this trip a treat. Service and onboard team are genuine, smartly dressed, cabin interior spotless and onboard service offer is what I would expect and then a little extra. Ondemand offer and inflight entertainment plus transit through LAX - a job made easy through a great supply chain with Air NZ team on board and on the ground

### "not be as loyal in future"
Dunedin to Los Angeles via Auckland. For this flight, the booking agent put me on a connecting flight with a non-star alliance carrier. And at the check-in gate, I was informed that I might have to pay an extra $800when I got to the US because it was a non star alliance flight. This was not advised when I booked the flight, otherwise I would have chose a different connecting flight! Not what I call great service for a $4000USD++ ticket. The attitude tone of the gate agents was not helpful either. Generally service on the flights is excellent, but I do notice that overall customer service is declining significantly outside of the flights. Service from agents varies significantly. Information provided on baggage policies etc is inconsistent or not disclosed by all agents so be very careful to ask and keep a record. Not all agents disclose full fee policies. For example, one time the airline tried to withhold a service fee from a refund. Fortunately, I was refunded but only because they reviewed the phone recordings which confirmed that I explicitly asked the original agent about the policies (and the agent hadn't mentioned a service fee withholding). As background, I have been flying on Air NZ for over 13 years and been an elite or gold airpoints member for over 8 years. With the non-flight service experience declining, I will definitely not be as loyal in future.

### "absolutely fabulous trip"
Perth to Auckland. Haven't flown Air New Zealand for some time but we had an absolutely fabulous trip. The staff were really great, the wine wonderful and the food tremendous. The flat bed is narrow after Singapore Airlines but it was fine and we had a good sleep. We were very impressed and are about to do the next leg to LAX. We did have an over 13 hr hold over but booked into the Novotel and after a kip went into Auckland on the sky bus. The crew on NZ 176 were maybe the best we have ever experienced and that includes SIA. This route was by far the cheapest for BC.

### "most uncomfortable journey"
My wife and me flew from Auckland to Singapore by Air New Zealand. The flight was full, it was the most uncomfortable journey my wife and me have ever undertaken. Seats were tiny. The food tray kept sliding off the tray tops. Brought it to the attention of flight attendant who replied she couldn't do anything about it. Service was atrocious. Midway toilets were filthy. Meals unappetising. Nothing cheerful but dreary looking. Never again on this airline.

### "crew were always friendly and professional"
I flew Auckland - Los Angeles return on NZ6 & NZ5 recently. The business class cabins on this route are always full these days. With that, service levels were never compromised, the crew were always friendly and professional. One of the stewards remembered me from the same flight in February and remembered that my drink of choice was Single Malt Whisky. The main course choice for me on the outward route was the most sublime Beef Rib Roast that I have ever tasted. All through the night there is a crew member available for anything you need and a good range of snacks and drinks are available. The inward flight was 30 minutes late leaving due to passengers not turning up for the flight, but we still arrived back in Auckland early. Without a doubt Air New Zealand would always be my airline of choice for this route.

### "never use this airline again"
Christchurch to Sydney via Auckland. As Air New Zealand does not have business class trans tasman from some cities I had to take my flight via Auckland. We took off on time but, unfortunately there was a medical emergency on board and the flight had to land back in Christchurch. I understand and support the fact that the aircraft turned around to ensure the health of the passenger. There were numerous passengers connecting on different flights. I asked the crew member and she told me that the airline had made arrangements on arrival in Auckland for connecting flights and that we would need to hurry to catch the connecting flight. Arrived in Auckland and were met by an Air New Zealand staff member and were put on a bus to international terminal. At no time was I told that they would not hold the connecting flight NZ105. Had to run through the terminal and immigration to try and catch the flight, there was an Air New Zealand representative outside immigration who told me the gate had closed a few minutes ago and that I needed to go to the international transfer desk. I attended the transfer desk only to be advised that I would be put on an alternative flight, I was happy with that but it was not a business class flight. I have paid for a business class flight so I expect to be put on a business class flight. Staff at the transfer counter could not give a dam about it, just rolled their eyes and said oh well. I asked for a refund and the lady handed me the telephone of which there was a long wait to talk to an Air New Zealand staff member for my refund. I hung up and then asked to speak to the manager who told me that I could get a refund at the ticketing office in the departures hall or by submitting a email. I then had to proceed back the other way though immigration and customs to the check in terminal and book a business class flight on QF so I could get back to Sydney. I managed to get a flight immediately and I paid full fare for the flight. Under advice from the manager at the transfer desk I then proceeded to the ticket office to get a refund. I was then told that this could not be done and I had to ring up. Emailed the Air New Zealand executive teams personal emails with a complaint over a week ago and still have not heard anything back. Will never use this airline again.

### "poor customer service"
After looking forward to flying with Air New Zealand from Auckland to Hong Kong we were extremely disappointed with their poor customer service. We upgraded to a Skycouch as my wife has arthritis and we paid an additional £300 for this. On boarding we discovered they had made an error and not booked us the Skycouch. We were promised a refund. Almost 2 months later they still owe us £300 and have failed to respond to any emails, or return phone calls when promised they will arrange someone to phone us back. Their lack of customer care is appalling. We were not the only ones they made a booking error with and we were told by inflight staff that the service centre are always making errors. They clearly do not take care with their service and can't be bothered dealing with their customers. Even before we flew they failed to answer emails. At the airport didn't offer any help to my disabled wife, just passing us between one person and another who couldn't just advise us where to go for the necessary wheelchair.

### "They replaced my bag"
Tokyo to Auckland. I traveled firstly from Whangarei to Auckland and the baggage handlers seriously damaged my bag. I Flow the next day and on arrival e-mailed Air NZ. The response was immediate, and was sorted out then and there. They replaced my bag so I was able to travel 3 weeks with no hastles. Narita Airport ground staff were fantastic. I am Gluten intolerant and the meals were great.

### "unimpressed with the lack of care"
Booked through Air New Zealand Star Alliance, flight got cancelled and only got notified once at the airport. Shocking service from both Air New Zealand and Virgin. Should have arrived in the Gold Coast mid afternoon, will now arrive around 2.30am. Have lost money in pre paid accomodation and childcare but got told refunding our tickets wasn't even an option. Neither airline wanted to know about it. I would not recommend using Air New Zealand's Star Alliance service, very unimpressed with the lack of care factor for the passengers time and loss of money.

### "the service was excellent"
I flew Auckland direct to Perth on 23 March 2017 in premium economy (25J) with Air New Zealand. The service was excellent and the extra leg room is very welcome. Very nice meal. Would like the seats to have a little more cushioning for long haul flights otherwise no complaints at all.

### "staff on NZ449 were outstanding"
Auckland to Wellington. The staff on the flight NZ449 were outstanding. I was travelling with my daughter back home and they topped our trip off. She had a grin on her face from the start of the flight until the end of the flight. Thank you for making her feel like she was the only one on the plane. She will definitely remember this experience!

### "not willing to give us refunds"
We were supposed to fly with Air New Zealand from Melbourne to Queenstown on Friday 31/03/2017. 9:10 am was the original departure time, however was delayed again and again without letting us know the updated estimated departure time, and without letting us know the reason for delay. This is absolutely fine, as delay happens to any flight. At about 11:30am, finally, we started boarding. At about 12:15pm, about 40min after boarding, all the passengers were pulled off from the aircraft, without letting us know the reason. Then, we were asked to wait for another hour for further instructions. At about 1pm the flight was cancelled. This is also fine, as long as they have other plans to bring us there. At about 2:30pm, after another long wait, they arranged us to fly to Sydney and then interchange to Queenstown, and the arrival time in Queenstown will be 2:30pm on the second day. This arrangement was unacceptable to us. We explained our situation again and again but they did nothing, and without a single word for apology. Immediately after that, we booked another flight that will arrive Queenstown in the early morning. After this, we did not get refunds for the tickets. The counter asked us to call the sales representative, then the representative asked us to call our booking agent, but the booking agent asked us to call airline sales representative. What's wrong with Air NewZealand? They cancelled the flight, but they were not willing to give us refunds.

### "still managed to sleep"
Must say having had a fantastic experience a few days earlier to get this flight it made this flight much easier. The plane was packed full with people however, I never felt like I didn't have enough space. On a 10.5 hour flight I still managed to sleep for more than 5 hours. Really liked the staff and the way the plane was organized.

### "very professional, experienced staff"
Flew from London to Los Angeles. Was curious to fly Air New Zealand expecting it would be good. After many hours of flights on all kind of airlines, I must say it was a fantastic (kiwi) experience. Very professional, experienced staff, I loved the space on the 777-300 and managed to have a very good sleep. The system to order a drink is fantastic. The inflight Entertainment is not as good as the Middle East competitors, but the comfort and staff made it much easier to deal with the trip.

### "plane was clean and new"
Flew from Auckland to Christchurch with Air New Zealand, plane was clean and new, seats were comfortable and the crew were very professional. Service was excellent for the short flight, complimentary tea, coffee and water were provided along with a light snack and lollies.

### "everything was very quick and easy"
I flew Air New Zealand from Queenstown to Auckland via Christchurch. Even with just a 35 min stop in CHC there was no problem with baggage checked in or the passengers. Everything was very quick and easy. Nice ground staff at the check in and gates. Nice and new planes (A320), with a narrow legroom, very nice and relaxed cabin crew. No wi-fi or power outlets.

### "a low cost experience"
Flew from Auckland to Christchurch. Flying with Air New Zealand on a domestic route is a low cost experience. You really have to add - when you buy the ticket online - any baggage to put in the hold. They will be very strict about the maximum weight (23kg wich is better then other airlines). Also be aware that carry-on lugagge really has to fit into grill at the boarding gate. Seats are not very spacious but is ok for such a flight. Just cookies and water are served. Very good creative emergency exits movie (one of the best I have seen). This cabin crew were the most clumsy I have seen, particulary the purser that never seemed to know when to show the movies, when to serve the candies, etc..

### "it was a pleasant experience"
Auckland to Wellington. This was my first time on Air New Zealand, and it was a pleasant experience. The cabin crew were very attentive, which made me comfortable. The plane was new, and the flight was pleasant. It was a short 1-hour flight, so the passengers were served with light snacks.

### "service on all these planes was outstanding"
Flew London Heathrow - Los Angeles - Auckland - Sydney and return on 5 separate planes in January and February. The service on all these planes was outstanding, food excellent and entertainment excellent. Though the 777 is not as spacious as the A380 it was still very comfortable. The only thing wrong with Air New Zealand is their lousy website which is difficult to navigate. Online check in only worked once out of 5 times necessitating expensive phone calls, otherwise the best airline I've flown.

### "be prepared for lack of comfort"
My family flew from Vancouver to Auckland and I feel it necessary to let intercontinental flyers know what they are in for with a 777-200. The staff for Air New Zealand are fantastic, but the amount of seats on the plane, uncomfortable seating, and design of the new seats is very disappointing. When boarding this long haul flight be prepared for lack of comfort compared to other airlines flying the same destinations. I will avoid Air New Zealand on this type of plane at all costs. Even in the upgraded seats, its not worth the extra cost.

### "do not honor seat selection"
London to Los Angeles. Air NZ do not honor seat selection! I chose my Air NZ business class seat online two weeks prior to departure only for my choice to be abruptly changed at the last minute without notification, let alone consent (there had been no change of aircraft type). Overheard two other business class pax complaining about the same thing. What's the point of their online seat map? The cabin crew are nice, but can't mix a proper gin and tonic if their lives depended on it. Unusually, no wine list on the business class menu. You get what they happen to have on board - although the Marlborough Pinot Noir was quite good, as was the meal. Seating is the le herring bone arrangement, with seats angled away from the windows. Elbow room between the partitions is narrow. There is insufficient space for the ritual post-takeoff / pre-meal drink and snack - just a tiny foldout shelf awkwardly located behind your right shoulder. There is a full-size pull-out table, but it is impossible to deploy the video screen while the table has anything on it. A 180-degree flat bed is available, but using it involves a disruptive maneuver requiring one to stand up and get help from the cabin crew to flip the whole seat back over. By the time that is accomplished, I'm wide awake again.

### "seats comfy, the food was good"
San Francisco to Auckland and my first time flying long haul with Air New Zealand. Comming from New Zealand I should fly them more. I have no complaints about the flight. The seats were comfy, the food was good, and the inflight entertainment was good. I was slightly disappointed by a couple of attitudes from staff, which I didn't expect. However there was a lovely attendant who we chatted too quite a bit and he looked after us. I will be flying Air New Zealand again.

### "Air New Zealand never again"
❎ Unverified |  Singapore to Auckland, a Singapore Airlines code share. This was a jam packed daytime flight, and the cabin crew were completely overwhelmed as far as service was concerned. The 9 across Boeing 787 in economy is a sardine can. The food was really bad (as it was when I later flew Christchuch to Sydney). I got one beer with food service. There was no second provision for a second drink. However my wife seized upon a passing attendant, and I did get a glass of 'award winning wine' slopped into the empty beer glass. I had reasonably high expectations of Air New Zealand, but never again! Cabin crew manning levels, and the dreadful food are an issue for management.

### "our reservation was not honoured"
We had booked our ticket 6 months prior to flying, with reservations made for Skycouch at an extra cost of $799. Upon boarding our flight from Vancouver to Auckland we were seated in economy, with no explanation as to why our reservation was not honored. We both work very physical jobs, and spent a number of months saving, this was one of the major treats we were looking forward to on our journey. It was extremely dissappointing, and frustrating having paid all that money for nothing. After numerous attempts as to find out why Air New Zealand failed to provide us with our reservation, and granting our seats someone else. I am still waiting for any clarification, and refund for extra service / product not received. The customer service is awful, they ignore any inquires and deemed the situation an "unforeseen circumstance". They are quick to take your money, and that's about it. I have had very little feedback, and would have flown with a different air carrier had I known the outcome of the scenario.

### "nuisance in my journey"
I got Air New Zealand flight for Singapore to Auckland sector second time as it's a partner of Star Alliance, as I booked my flight mainly with Singapore airlines to travel to Bangalore. Air New Zealand flight is nuisance in my journey as they mainly I can't check in online and select my seat in the flight. My rest of the journey I could select my seat in Singapore Airlines flights before 48 hours of travelling. Last time I ended up in last middle row and the middle near toilet. I could not rest at at all because of constant toilet flushes. And my seat allotted away from my family in same flight. I requested other passenger to swap my seat hence I can sit along with my family.

### "the seats left much to be desired"
First time I've flown internationally in quite a few years, self check in at Auckland was a bit confusing but there are staff members that can assist you. Boarding was delayed by about 30 minutes but the flight still left on time and arrived in Honolulu early. For an overnight flight, everyone gets a blanket and pillow which is a nice touch but simple things such as an amenities kit with a toothbrush would be nice like I always get when I fly Emirates economy. The plane was very new and cleaned well, the seats left much to be desired, I'm not a very big person (5'5) and my knees were pushing into the seat in front of me a little bit when I reclined my seat, I would hate to be any bigger. The seat itself left much to be desired, the padding on my back was non existent, the seat was extremely hard and uncomfortable to sleep in, it felt like I was sitting against wood the whole flight, the only thing that helped me to sleep was putting the pillow behind me. The cabin crew were extremely friendly throughout the whole process from check in till getting off the plane. I was on "The Works" fare so I got movies, meals and drinks included, I honestly think that for a 8hr30+ flight that should really be included in your fare without having to pay an extra $50 for it, but I did get dinner after take off (Lamb stew which was surprisingly OK) and a continental breakfast a few hours before landing. Inflight entertainment was very fluid worked well but I didn't use it much unless it was to order a drink throughout the flight since I wanted to sleep rather than watch a movie etc. All in all the flight and experience was decent, although next time I will avoid them on a night flight due to the ridged awful uncomfortable seats.

### "surly, tired and almost angry"
Auckland to Los Angeles in economy class. Flew into Auckland from Guangzhou on China Southern and had expected Air New Zealand to offer something better. Alas I was wrong! The Boeing 777 seats are cramped, and the width is awful, made worse by the cabin being full and not an empty seat in sight. The Kiwi charm I had experienced on holiday around NZ was missing - staff seemed surly, tired and almost angry. After reading some praiseworthy reviews before about Air NZ, I'm wondering if they travelled the same airline? For me, never again, and maybe it's time one realised that lesser known airlines (even in China!) seem to have overtaken more established airlines.

### "summer price for premium economy was just far too much"
Flew economy class on Air NZ from Melbourne to Auckland for the first time in probably 5 years. The summer price for premium economy was just far too much. The seat was not properly cleaned and still had some small scraps on them but was ok on comfort. The food was not good and I only ate half of it. The staff service was good and the IFE was good too.

### "fantastic helping me to change my flight"
Flew Christchurch to Melbourne. I had a hiking accident while in New Zealand resulting in surgery for a fracture. Air New Zealand were fantastic helping me to change my flight, listening to my sorry tale, ringing me while I was still in hospital to see what help they could offer and best of all organising a row to myself so I could elevate my leg. The flight attendant kept a watchful eye on me the entire flight continually checking on me. Thank you so much Air NZ.

### "this was all pretty good"
Auckland to Sydney. I purchased "The Works" package and my friend and I chose 2 seats by themselves at the rear (Row 57). She was upgraded leaving me 2 seats to myself. The configuration was a bit strange as I had 3 seats in front of me and there was a "bump" in the fuselage there, meaning my screen was not directly in front of me. But we left and arrived on time, the food was good, the movie selection was very good, and the flight was smooth and arrived on time. As with other airlines / flight crews, they don't seem to notice when people have their seat reclined and the windows shades down during take-off and landing. Not a huge fan or Air NZ internationally based on past experiences but this was all pretty good.

### "extremely enjoyable flights"
Auckland to Nadi return. Extremely enjoyable flights both ways on recently renovated aircraft. Breakfast flight over was really good and arrived early. Return flight was a full lunch flight and the crew worked hard and were accommodating. Most were personable, mature crew members but unlike some US airlines the senior crew members could still manage a genuine smile. They looked like they enjoyed flying together. Food very good apart from dessert at lunch, which was dry, but I had no room after the cheese anyway. Check in in Fiji slow and a surly airport staff member who barely looked at you. Otherwise really great. Flights on time both ways, new Nadi lounge was good, bags off quickly both times.

### "food very good and wine sublime"
Brisbane to Wellington via Auckland. The service on the trans Tasman legs was exceptional. The food was very good and wine sublime, there is a new Fine Wines of NZ program that features the best wines in the country. Crew smiling and accommodating and personal in their service. One crew member recalled us from one flight to another and asked about our holiday with sufficient detail that he had been listening to the previous conversation. Brisbane lounge although new is humble re reading material and food. Auckland is much better, Wellington domestic the best of the lot. We missed our domestic connection in AKL due to long queues in the airport, this was handled well by the airline. Departure in AKL was the only glitch, the call in the lounge that the plane is in the final stages of boarding and when at the gate waiting another 30 minutes to board Business. This was the only glitch, otherwise for international short haul this was close to perfect.

### "seats were wide and comfortable"
Wonderful flight from Singapore to Auckland return in premium economy. A small cabin that seats 21 in 2-3-2 formation. The leather seats were wide and comfortable and the mood lighting in the cabin made it seem modern. The premium economy section is behind the business class section and has its own allocated toilet. Food and drink was delicious and cabin staff were smartly dressed, attentive and friendly. Afternoon tea was offered between main meals and snacks could be ordered from your seat via the entertainment system.

### "flight was okay, nothing more"
Sydney to Christchurch. I do not understand why Air New Zealand often gets glowing reviews. It is an okay airline but nothing more. Budget airlines in Asia such as Cebu Pacific and Air Asia provide a similar service, and Air NZ is definitely not a budget airline when one has to buy a ticket at the last minute for the relatively short trip over the Tasman sea. There was very little leg room on the plane. My flight was okay, nothing more. One knows that one is heading towards New Zealand when one sees the cabin staff, compared to flying on Asian airlines.

### "Air New Zealand cost cutting"
NZ805 Christchurch to Brisbane. I consider this flight an excellent choice for having sufficient time in the morning in Christchurch to have brunch with family before flying home. Check in effortless at Christchurch Airport. Made use of Koru Lounge prior to boarding with Koru membership. Boarding quick. Aircraft perhaps 85% full. Once loaded, an unexpected 30 minute delay occurred. However, flight landed in Brisbane 15 minutes early. The only male flight attendant presented as disinterested, appearing unhappy and 'going through the motions. Female flight attendants were positively engaged in their occupation. Food offerings consisted of two hot meals for 'The Works' passengers. The beef, rice and vegetable option was tasty enough for airline food. However portion small. It has been noted on a number of Air New Zealand flights taken recently that soft drinks are not served by the can, but rather out of the can and into the plastic cup by the flight attendants. While innocent in service to passengers, this is portion control by any description and therefore Air New Zealand cost cutting. I have also noticed that when the Customer Service Manager reads the offerings out across the PA, there is no mention of soft drinks, only tea, coffee and water. Bags out on belt within 15 minutes at Brisbane Airport. While I consider Air New Zealand to be a good airline, they pale in comparison to Qantas with service delivery. Overall a good flight, but Air New Zealand let themselves down with these issues.

### "fly Premium Economy again"
Auckland to Singapore. Check-in at Auckland Airport excellent - nice welcome and straight through to Immigration Control. Premium Economy area was very relaxing and the Customer Service brilliant. When we arrived at our seats, there was a welcome with our names on the ptv screen and the menu was also great. We felt that Premium Economy was more like a mini business class. The cabin crew were helpful and friendly. We will definitely fly Premium Economy with Air New Zealand again.

### "really cramped seats"
Vancouver to Auckland with Air New Zealand. In summary, really cramped seats, movie selection was a nothing special, food was only average. The seats were so cramped that even I, an average build asian girl, felt squeezed. Which was not a great experience for a 14 hour flight. I would assume this is so because of the usual seat formation of 3-3-3 being converted into a 3-4-3 to maximize profits. Movie selection was a bit outdated, with movies from a couple of months ago. Food was almost tasteless to me, seems to be catering mostly to European tastes. Pricing was rather high for such a flight, considering that it was almost 20% more expensive to take this 14 hour flight compared to taking a flight from Vancouver to Singapore (which takes 18 hours). In conclusion, I'd believe taking this airline is not worth it.

### "very disappointing experience"
Auckland to Apia on a Boeing 787. I Flew Business Premier and was not impressed. Quantity and Quality of food (breakfast) was not good enough to meet the standards of any other airlines. A sort of Omlette was literally swimming in undefined liquid, the choices of food was very limited. But the worst experience was the seat, which was very narrow and uncomfortable. It had a small amount of different positions and there was no really "lounge" position. I am of very average size and weight and I wonder how large people  could squeeze in. I asked the staff for a different seat and was told they were all the same. In fact I was flying the newest business Class seat in the latest Boeing 787 of Air New Zealand. As it was a day fly I did not use the "bed" position, but I could only guess that this would be a claustrophobic experience. All in all a very disappointing experience.

### "ripping off their public"
Napier to Dunedin via Christchurch. Just wasted a day of my life when yet again Air New Zealand first delayed my flight then cancelled it altogether. Then placed on last flight so a 3 hour flight turns into a 10 hour flight with no reason. Great results while ripping off their public. Should have driven, would have been quicker and more reliable.

### "they really screwed us"
Stranded in Heathrow due to 2+ hour delay on our flight from Barcelona and missed our Air New Zealand flight by 30 minutes so forced to purchase another ticket to get home to LA. Air New Zealand counter person at Heathrow left for the day but an adjacent airline person used the Air New Zealand phone and called 800# for us and handed us the phone. I asked for the cheapest way home. They really screwed us. Not clear exactly what they were doing on the 45 minutes call but I learned after 2 months of asking for clarification and over a dozen emails that they used a $119 "credit" from flight we missed and then $250 dollars per tickets in fees. We were never told this detail over the phone. Had to pay $820 each ticket that would have been only $720 if bought without the "credit". When we got home I called and asked for the passenger taxes paid on the flight not taken and was refused. They have a cleaver way of "using" the taxes on the replacement ticket if you let them use the "credit". They ended up screwing us out of a total of $350 by using the 'credit'. The extra $100 per tickets x 2 - $200 and taxes of $150 for a total of $350 lost. Make sure you are aware of this sneaky deal, and avoid paying more than the replacement ticket cost!

### "beware of such tactics"
Los Angeles to Sydney thru Auckland. I had read good things about the airline, and they kept showing how they won an award for excellence. The service in coach was slow, off-hand and on a par -- at best -- with UA standards. Seats were small and very narrow, making for an uncomfortable trip. Food ok but small portions. After my trip I looked into the award they boast about and realise it's not what it seems! Its decided by a website in Australia whose biggest advertiser on their website is Air New Zealand - go figure!? Buyer beware of such tactics.

### "failed miserably for me"
The test of an airline is how they do when things don’t go to plan and while Air New Zealand does a good job when things are going well, they failed miserably for me. On a recent trip from Los Angeles to Adelaide return via Auckland, our outbound aircraft from LAX was late arriving from London. They chose to hold our plane for customers out of London to clear customs as opposed to offloading them from our aircraft and putting them on the other flight to Auckland which is scheduled after the one I was on. They boarded us and then made us wait on the aircraft for 1.5 hours waiting for passengers. We arrived in Auckland just as my connecting flight was scheduled to depart. Even though they held us for 1.5 hours in LAX, they did not hold our flight to Adelaide for 45 minutes. They rerouted us through Sydney. We boarded the flight to Sydney and then proceeded to sit on that aircraft for more than an hour waiting for the passengers from the trailing flight from LA. Also, they did not give me a boarding pass in Auckland while other passengers were given their boarding passes. Because of holding the flight to Sydney, we then missed our connecting flight in Sydney and essentially we just dumped to Virgin Australia and Air New Zealand washed their hands of us. On my original Auckland to Adelaide flight I had a Works Deluxe ticket which is similar to a business class ticket but on the Virgin Australia flight they did not acknowledge a much higher priced ticket. I wrote to Air New Zealand and it took them more than two weeks to respond and provided an unsatisfactory response. Also, because of the issues I tried to access my reservation online and could not. I called and they redid the booking. However, when I got to the airport for my return, they had removed my Works Deluxe from Adelaide to Auckland even though it was on my original ticket. Further, on the return from Auckland to LA I had bid for a one up and they gave it to me at a cost even though there were empty seats remaining and this could have been a way for them to demonstrate they had not done a job they should have done on the outbound. In total the poor judgement by Air New Zealand added seven hours to my travel to Adelaide and I was on the phone with them for over an hour working on getting me online access to my return travel and they did not provide the miles due to me from Auckland onward. In both LAX and Auckland ground staff also showed indifference to the passengers trying to find out what their status was. They demonstrated a total lack of respect for the time of the travelers.

### "everything about the flight was average"
Flying NZ792 Adelaide to Auckland (then NZ553 on to Christchurch, which is not reviewed). In a word everything about the flight was "average". The best feature was that the flight departed and arrived early. The flight crew were not unpleasant, merely disinterested. Service of meal and drinks was slow. The meal was only typically airline food, with no obvious reference to New Zealand. The seat was comfortable but knee room seemed somewhat restricted. One of the three toilets was out of action, leading to queues for the others. The entertainment system worked and had a long list of options. I noted that one ratings system shows Air New Zealand as the Airline of the Year. On the basis of this flight I cannot imagine how that could be. I have flown on several airlines that I would rate much more highly than Air New Zealand.

### "crew service was faultless"
This is an overnight flight with Air New Zealand leaving Auckland at 0050 and arriving in Singapore early morning around 0630. I was seated in 1K. Flight attendant immediately greeted me by name, took my coat, assisted me with bag stowage and offered me a pre-takeoff drink. From then till the time I left the flight in Singapore the crew service was faultless and the food and beverages excellent. Pleasing to see that the range of available wines in business premier has improved in the past few months. Seat, however, was a bit disappointing on the 787. It feels narrower than the seat on the 777; the angle to the drinks tray is particularly awkward giving it a more cramped feel and the angle of the herringbone 1-1-1 layout across the cabin provides for very little privacy (you're literally looking at your neighbour across the aisle. Sleeping comfort was up to the usual standard. However, I think this arrangement is far less than ideal making me wish NZ would opt for a forward-facing seat. Range of movies was pretty minimal. Otherwise excellent.

### "the whole flying process was delightful"
I must say I was impressed by this airline. Although I had only two short flights inside New Zealand, they were both remarkable. Starting from the Check-In process (very smooth without any complicated steps), done via the mobile site and then obtaining the boarding pass in the App, using the check-in clients at the airport to print my own label for the luggage (with friendly assistance if needed), the whole flying process was delightful. There was even a question on the client machine if I would like my boarding pass printed or not. Because I had it already on the App I said no. I find this environmentally friendly. Then it is the uniforms of the flight attendances (Maori colourful style) and their smile that make you feel welcome. It really brings out the Kiwi hospitality that everybody talks about. Both flights landed ahead of schedule and while landing in Wellington we did have a lot of turbulences (problem known for this airport) and the plane was small, the pilots made a good job keeping us informed all the time. I really enjoyed the security video demonstration they have running right now, so original. They even serve you hot and cold beverages and a little snack for flights under 1h. The seats were comfortable enough and the legroom was decent. It really brings the pleasure of flying we are missing right now in Europe.

### "I spent the flight hunched"
Just flown Auckland to Sydney return, with Air New Zealand outbound and return with their partner Virgin Australia. The difference in the level of comfort between the two airlines was remarkable. The outward journey with Air New Zealand was in a Boeing 777-200 with a 3x4x3 seat configuration. My husband and I were in the middle section of the row, he on the aisle. As we boarded, passengers with backpacks were advised to carry the packs in front of them. Once we were onboard it was evident why this advice was offered. The aisles are extremely narrow with the 3x4x3 configuration and my husband needed to make sure his elbow was always tucked in for fear of being hit by the meal/drinks carts or the crew walking up and down. The lady next to me spilled into my space, she was very plump and there was just not sufficient room to accommodate her size, so I spent the flight hunched trying to make myself as small as possible and I am petite to begin with. I cannot imagine what it would be like to be on a long haul flight on this aircraft, especially as none of the seats in our row reclined. Coming back with Virgin Australia was a completely different experience. The aircraft was a Boeing 737-800, a much smaller aircraft with just one central aisle, and 3x3 configuration. The seats were wider, there was more legroom and I did not feel jammed in at all. Virgin Australia is a no frills carrier. There are no screens for entertainment or safety videos or flight map, (although they are happy for you to download a free Virgin entertainment app for your laptop or phone) but I would gladly forgo the bells and whistles of Air New Zealand for the comfort of Virgin Air.

### "seats were comfortable and the crew fine"
My wife and I flew Air New Zealand from Christchurch to Sydney on an Airbus A320. We had a seat + bag fare and did not make any purchases on board. We left and arrived on time, the seats were comfortable and the crew fine. The flight was full. The safety videos are good fun.

### "never fly with Air New Zealand"
My parents were flying Brisbane to Norfolk Island for my mothers 80th birthday today. After driving from Bribie Island to the airport they went through customs and just before boarding they were informed they and 20 other people would be unable to fly as the plane tare weight was exceeded believed to be due to spare parts for another broken down plane on Norfolk Island. Air New Zealand customer service provided no compensation and advised them to go through their travel insurance. They had accommodation, hire car, tours etc booked plus having been looking forward to this holiday to celebrate her 80th birthday for quite some time. I for one will never fly with Air New Zealand if this is typical of how they treat their passengers.

### "will fly them again "
Los Angeles to London Heathrow. Amazing service by Air New Zealand with competitive Fares. Food very nice. Seat pitch on their Boeing 777-300ER is 32-33 inches. Window seat selection at time of booking was free of charge for most of the cabin. Cabin crew very friendly and helpful. Plane very clean and new. Will fly them again on this route, prefer them to British Airways.

### "arrived in Wellington 6 hours early"
My wife and I flew Auckland to Wellington with Air New Zealand on an Airbus A320. We arrived from Singapore on another carrier and had booked an evening flight down to Wellington leaving plenty of time to cover delays on the flight, border control etc. We arrived early and were in the domestic terminal within an hour of getting of the plane. We had a non transferable ticket but the agent put us on a flight leaving 45 minutes later at no extra cost meaning we arrived in Wellington 6 hours early. Snack and coffee served on this short leg, crew good.

### "everything proved very average"
Flew Christchurch to Brisbane. Air New Zealand have gone for fully automated check-in, which requires passengers to print out their boarding pass. Returning from holiday we had no facilities for printing, so we could not use the system. The one staff member there to assist was not busy, but it still took twice as long as normal check in. This was our first flight on ANZ, and based upon their reputation we had high expectations, but everything proved very average. Seat spacing was tight, with pretty hard seats with very little recline. The entertainment system was extensive and easy to operate, but was interrupted frequently by announcements. We had successfully, if unwittingly, navigated the catering system and did receive a meal, which was typical economy class fare, albeit with a very nice ice cream. The wine offering was the exception to the average rule, being the best wine selection I have experienced, and based upon the Sauvignon Blanc excellent quality. Overall a very average experience, but better than our flight to New Zealand on Qantas.

### "food, service and cabin comfort were excellent"
We flew business class with Air New Zealand from Auckland to London Heathrow with a transit through Los Angeles on NZ2 on 4 August 2016 returning by the same route in reverse on NZ1 on 28 September 2016. The flights were purchased well in advance, one fare at a promotional price and the other a companion fare using air points, which made the total cost quite economical for business class flights on a direct route with no hassles. We had reserved our seats in advance, 3K and 4K on the outward journey and 5K and 6K on the return. Having flown Air NZ before we knew what to expect and weren’t disappointed. The food, service and cabin comfort were excellent on all sectors. The kiwi cabin crew on the AUK-LAX legs would rate slightly above their UK counterparts but nothing was too much trouble and the level of service excellent on all legs. Air NZ does not offer WiFi yet but Bluetooth is able to be used, which I took advantage of as the headphones provided aren’t up to noise cancelling quality of Bose or Plantronics (my choice). Take an adapter if you want to use your own phones with the inflight entertainment system. There was a fair choice of films including some with subtitles but personally I preferred my own entertainment on iPad and tablet. The transit through LAX is not easy with long distances to walk and queues for immigration and security as the Air NZ lounge is landside. The transit time is supposed to be 2 hours but don’t expect much time in the lounge especially if the incoming flight is late. My wife had wheelchair assistance and so did I on the return due to a reoccurring problem. Auckland and Heathrow were very good but some of the “assistors” in LAX looked as if they needed wheelchairs themselves. The only blemish as far as Air NZ are concerned was that they “lost” my wife’s TravelScoot, which failed to appear at Auckland on the return leg. It turned up a couple of days later after being off loaded in LAX by mistake, probably due to incorrect labelling when it was checked in at Heathrow. We would certainly recommend Air NZ business class for long haul flights and would use them again in the future.

### "the bag drop was chaotic "
Auckland to Sydney. We sat in an exit row and got the benefit of extra leg room and excellent cabin crew service but we couldn't use the inflight entertainment during take off and landing. The online checkin process was smooth but we still needed to use the kiosk to print our boarding passes. I would prefer to have a seamless checkin via mobile app or smart watch. The bag drop was chaotic and an example of where technology has made things worse. Ground staff could have been more helpful.

### "sadistic 3-4-3 seating"
Sydney to Auckland, Boeing-777. Air New Zealand pinches pennies and has a 3-4-3 seating arrangement in a Boeing 777. This is unacceptable to me, (3-3-3 is what Boeing designed the B777 for) even though I am not a particularly large person. The seats and the aisles are narrow. The seats along the aisles all show marks of severe wear and tear from trolleys and passengers constantly banging into them. The seat cushions are hard as a rock, or just very thin. We were sitting in a skycouch seat which was useless since all the seats were occupied and no space to lie down. I wonder how much money this airline has flushed down the toilet on extra fuel, to haul the weight of these useless skycouches around the world. Maybe more than they gain by their sadistic 3-4-3 seating? Finally, Air New Zealand is addicted to endless annoying cabin announcements. Please cut it out, your customers are adults, not kindergarten children.

### "a really competitive price"
Los Angeles to Melbourne via Auckland. The best business class I have ever experienced. On boarding I was offered a choice of drinks and a hot towel. Post take off drink requests and meal selection soon followed. I was asked if I knew how to use the seat controls and given a demonstration - a first for me.The staff were helpful, cheerful and courteous and the meals superior. The seat was outstanding in terms of comfort and it was made into a bed using a memory foam mattress that gave me an extremely comfortable 7-8 hours sleep. The wash rooms were well equipped and the Auckland lounge was excellent. This was an outstanding product for a really competitive price.

### "has been a complete let down"
Auckland to Ho Chi Minh City. Ground service horrible. Air New Zealand has self check-in kiosk which they pride themselves of but it creates lots of issues for customers as there are not enough staff to assist customers with using the inadequately developed system that cannot accommodate the needs of all customers. The ground staff are not attentive. Let you wait without saying a word of acknowledgement. They have self service bag drop which cannot work sometimes and the assistance is also poor. There is no flexibility from the staff in regards to following baggage policy. I have experienced this problem and heard from three people with the same issues. Cleanliness - very old and dirty aircraft. Dirts and candies were on the floor under my seat, the grease stain was still on the inflight entertainment screen which I had to use my napkin to wipe off. The seat is very tight and not comfortable. Inflight entertainment compared to Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways, Cathay Pacific and Malaysia Airlines etc is much less. I guess they didn't really improve headphones quality as I had to ask to change headphones 3 times until I can find a pair that works. Food of a very low quality. I tried 'vietnamese cuisine' but it was really not vietnamese as the food was greasy and full of weird spices. This was my first time using Air New Zealand on an international flight and this has been a complete let down and my expectations of a high quality airline that they heavily invested in their PR to build the image has been destroyed. Personally speaking I think they have been trying to compete with low cost airlines too much to drive down costs and completely ignored how they get to a four-star airline in the first place. Overall, utter disappointment.

### "squeezing in as many seats as possible"
A recent flight on Air New Zealand's night time service to Singapore left me thinking this airline is more and more becoming a lost cost airline than an actual low cost airline. Arrived early at the airport to be greeted by one very helpful person who referred me onto service agents. The first lady was ignorant and could not care less about acknoeledging those waiting while helping others. Then went to somone else even more useless who informed me no I cannot check luggage through as they don't code share with the carrier I was due to travel from Singapore to Hanoi which was ridiculous considering both Air NZ and that airline share the same terminal in Singapore and also the same transer counters. Checking in these days on multiple flights on seperate tickets is possible all over the world, obviously not at Air New Zealand. Much more assistance provided by Changi airport staff than by Air New Zealand. The aircraft a fairly new 787 was tight in economy due to squeezing in as many seats as possible including its overvalued sky couch. Food and beverage way below par compared to other four star airlines. No bread roll,jam and butter for breakfast and scrambled eggs run out after 9th row of economy with the rest getting some tasteless noodles with not much though having gone into their menu where most passengers are european. Avoid this Airline if you can at all costs

### "enjoyable flight experience"
Hong Kong to Auckland overnight flight with Air New Zealand. Wide selection of entertainment options on AVOD, and it is great to be able to watch gate to gate. Dinner and breakfast served, both meals delicious. Frequent water runs during flight and washrooms kept clean. The only downside is the seat comfort and spacing-10 abreast seating makes it very tight indeed. Overall enjoyable flight experience.

### "thoroughly enjoyable flight"
Auckland to Houston. A thoroughly enjoyable flight, with a very competent crew in the business class. Food was sublime, as was the service. A good range of snacks were available during the night, plus tea or coffee. Breakfast options were comprehensive. We arrived on time in Houston.

### "staff are exceptional, caring"
Air New Zealand is one of the best in business class. The staff are exceptional, caring and have everything down to perfection. The menu is restaurant quality and flat beds allow for a decent sleep. I have just arrived in Auckland on NZ5 from Los Angeles and I wish to thank the staff for their wonderful help and care.

### "general air of disinterest"
Wellington to London via Hong Kong. I am a Kiwi expat, have lived in London for 17 years and have used Air New Zealand many times over the years when returning to NZ to see family. I have to say that gradually, over time, I believe the airline has fallen into the trap of believing its own PR. The first thing you hear when you get on a flight these days is about the latest award the airline has won. While there have been upgrades over the years to the fleet, in-flight entertainment and recently check-in procedures (more on this later), the personal touch and focus on service that made the airline stand out, are no longer as obvious and seem to be replaced with a slightly superior cockiness that is not that attractive. Over recent flights Air New Zealand have dropped a brand new solid suitcase on its corner, stoving it in. When I complained (which was extremely time consuming and difficult), I was told the suitcase still works fine so Air New Zealand were not going to offer anything by way of remediation. Lost our luggage between Auckland and Wellington (via the high tech new check-in procedure). When I registered concern on the return flight I was told by a cocky attendant that Air New Zealand doesn't lose luggage so I must have been on another airline!). Ironically when we registered our lost luggage we were in a not insignificant queue and the ground staff gave the impression that this was a very frequent event. On my last trip, 4 out of 6 flights on the return journey from London to Wellington were late, one of which arrived very late in Auckland which required a group of transferring passengers to run from domestic to international to make the next flight. This caused stress and anxiety. While I am sure Air New Zealand would say that some of the causal factors are out of its control, I think it is the general air of disinterest mixed with self congratulatory arrogance that puts me off the most. Will I continue to use Air New Zealand - well possibly because the network of flights to and from the UK is generally very convenient in terms of door to door elapsed travel time. But I certainly don't feel as patriotic and loyal towards the airline as I used to and I certainly check out other flight options a lot more than I used to.

### "never travel Air New Zealand again"
I was absolutely shocked and disgusted to discover on my 3hr 50mins flight from Queenstown to Brisbane no meal was provided. For an international flight you are offered water, tea or coffee. Not even a snack. When I queried the flight attendant she made me feel like an idiot for not knowing. Travelling with a 5 and 6 year old and not being prepared for the fact there would be no food supplies was not fun! I will never travel with Air New Zealand again.

### "the cabin was freezing"
Flew Air New Zealand from Auckland to Bali. The cabin was freezing. After 3 blankets and the pilot putting the temp up I could hear other passengers in business class complaining about cold feet etc. I was dressed for Auckland winter. My sister-in-law had the same prob from Brisbane. Staff were very nice.

### "a defacto hybrid carrier"
Efficient airline, but getting a feeling that the personal touch is sacrificed in the name of convenience. Awful (non-existent) food and drinks. You can preselect seats. Anything in front is "preferred seats" and it is very difficult for those with Seats Only or Seats + Bags option to purchase them. Preferred seats are $10 one way and standard seats $5. You have to pay a surcharge if booked via cards. Check in is always done by automated kiosks with no exceptions allowed. You will require assistance if you are non-machine literate or not conversant in using English. I noticed large tour group from China required a Chinese-speaking staff to press the kiosk screens to check in for them. Then you drop the bag onto the continuously running conveyor belt yourself, with poorly designed ergonomics. Also it doesn't matter if you are elite or Koru Club members - you still drop the bags yourself. There are still agents at the gate (for the time being). Boarding is done through rows in order. Often if you are sitting at rows 16 or over you are required to exit the airbridge halfway, climb down stairs walk over the tarmac and reboard via stairs at the rear door. The seats are standard, with pitch left to the bare minimum. They are often rather dirty as well. Safety demonstration is by videos. It is often slick marketing that does not really impart information easily enough to passengers especially non-English speaking ones. Inflight you are offered a cookie or crisp with only tea, coffee, or mineral water. No meals or hot snacks are available. If you fly during Koru Hours (before 8 am and 4:30 pm to 7 pm) you get cheese and crackers instead of cookies and crisps and beer and wine are available as additional options. Breakfast fare is muffins. Staff are friendly - which is the only redeeming feature. Almost all flights between Christchurch and Wellington use the ATR-72 these days which means you walk in the rain on the tarmac on wet days, plus greater chance of weather-related delays, and reduced comfort level due to narrower seats and much smaller overhead lockers. The rationale is to offer "hourly service given the current level of demand". This is a defacto hybrid carrier - not really a full service unlike Cathay Pacific or even Qantas. Decision-makers listen to what some business travellers (not all) want, yet they ended up making a the majority unhappy. Overall, I will pick Air New Zealand for domestic flights just because they are the only airline offering reasonable schedules. The only competitor (Jetstar) offers only a few flights per day and on main trunk routes only plus a few turboprop flights. However I will actively go out of my way to avoid Air New Zealand when flying internationally.

### "service and amenities great"
Service and amenities great. Meal service lousy. Seems the finance-wallahs run rampant at Air NZ nowadays based on the (vegetarian) meal service provided - salad, roll and shrink wrapped brownie aside, hot dinner was just sauteed peppers and eggplant on rice. Mean spirited and pretty lazy menu planning. Still at least I did not have to suffer the bog standard butter chicken that seems to appear on every flight. At breafast time my meal was inadvertently given to another passenger leaving me with no hot dish until crew were able to source something from business class - but only after service was finished in J class. Got my meal 30 minutes before landing. Crew very apologetic for the slip up and did their best to put it right. Other than that, the crew make Air NZ, else its a pretty ordinary airline and a far cry from how great it used to be. Lounge great at Auckland and staff service at premium check-in exemplary in checking bags all the way thrgh to Ottawa via Houston and Newark (what is with the self service kiosks at premium check in? Hardly premium).

### "Vietnamese food was not as authentic"
Auckland to Ho Chi Minh City. The aircraft itself was quite old (it is the oldest among Air New Zealand fleet). The Western food was excellent, but the Vietnamese food was not as authentic. The flight attendant surprised me a bit when speaking simple Vietnamese to me. Staff were friendly, yet not very attentive. Comparing with the price among all other airlines (involving transit), Air NZ is the best airline so far that fly from Auckland to Vietnam.

### "a very warm welcome"
Return day trip to Queenstown today. Nice breakfast in the Koru Lounge then straight on board with a very warm welcome. Very friendly crew and lots of information from the flight deck. Served coffee and muffin, then water before landing. Wonderful views of the Alps. Return mid afternoon flight back. Crew friendly, service not as good. Toilets not cleaned and stunk. Not a good impression.

### "service gone out the window"
Air New Zealand service has gone out the window, be careful the website obviously has bugs in it. I booked a ticket back from the Sunshine Coast to Auckland they somehow booked me from Gold Coast to Auckland and want to charge more then the ticket to change it. On top of that they put me on a Virgin plane which has cramped seats. Warning do not book Air New Zealand I got better service from other Airlines.

### "inflight safety video is fun "
Second time on Air New Zealand domestic, from Queenstown to Auckland, their aircraft are so new! I should mention their inflight safety video  "Men in black", which is fun and attention grabbing at the same time, just what safety videos should be doing. Thumbs up  for the innovation. The flight was around 1.5hrs, wine, cheese etc. Not bad for domestic. Attentive cabin crew, flight information by the captain, great legspace. Overall, awesome experience.

### "definitely fly them again"
First time on Air New Zealand domestic. Christchurch to Queenstown on A320, flight exactly on time, aircraft felt new, super clean, it was a short flight, light refreshment, cabin crews were friendly. Overall, a great first time flight with Air NZ. Will definitely fly them again.

### "service overall couldn't be better"
Highly recommend Air New Zealand. Flew with them for 4 flights recently from Sydney to Los Angeles via Auckland and couldn't be happier. The entertainment on the 787s is class leading and so is the comfort and quietness of the cabin. On the long haul flight from Auckland to Los Angeles we (family of 4) were on the 777-300ER. We got a decent sleep and the food and entertainment I rate 9/10. The service overall couldn't be better, they are very friendly and proud. I take my hat off for the service I received and I loved the 777-300 (All Black) livery.

### "friendly and helpful cabin staff"
Great all round flying experience with the All Blacks from Christchurch to Sydney. Very nicely appointed aircraft with black seats and seat backs. Wide touchscreen infotainment which is full of high-quality entertainment options. On time departure, before time arrival. Polite, friendly and helpful cabin staff. Meals provided in a 3-hour flight and that too quite good quality and of a nice portion size. Free beverages available on board. Clear announcements, a short, entertaining safety briefing video. Hassle free self check-in and bag drop at the airport. All in all, my first experience with the All Blacks has been a very pleasant one. Air New Zealand definitely packs a punch above their weight.

### "lack of information was appalling"
Sydney to San Francisco with Air New Zealand. First flew this airline for business in 2015 in Premium class and had a good experience. This year, four of us flew economy with my son and I in emergency row seats and my wife and daughter in a skycouch. Never again will we travel with Air New Zealand. The aircraft was delayed in Sydney so we missed the Auckland connection to SFO and were stuck 12 hours at Sydney which is one of the worst airports in the world. I have no argument with delaying an aircraft for safety reasons. However, as the hours ticked by and it became obvious that the reason the flight was delayed on the grounds that the aircraft was being cleaned proved false and there were technical problems, the counter staff became ruder and ruder in answering our questions. The lack of information was appalling. All we got were text messages every couple of hours. We finally arrived in Auckland the day after and got seats on the SFO bound flight for the 11th June and not the 10th as in the original flight. Neither my son or I got emergency row seats and the skycouch proved to be a joke. The seats are hard and abrasive and my wife and daughter didn't sleep a wink. A waste of an extra $700 for no discernible benefit. The airline is now quibbling about refunding the extra funds paid for the lack of an emergency row seat on the forward leg as I was given a 'preferred' seat on the flight from Auckland to SFO. This preferred seat was right up the back on the window. I am 188 cms tall and could not move without waking the persons in the middle and aisle seats and was extremely uncomfortable and did not sleep the entire flight. A bad start to a holiday not improved by the unprofessional and incompetent behaviour of the staff at Sydney Airport. We will never fly Air New Zealand again.

### "felt like second class citizens"
To sum my family's experience up with Air New Zealand on our most recent trips with them - we felt like second class citizens. In my opinion, Air New Zealand's standards have really slipped since I flew with them in 2010. We flew Apia to Auckland, then Auckland to Sydney the next day. When I made our bookings 2 months before travelling, I only had a small selection of the worst seats on the aircraft (which I had to pay $40 each leg to choose) as the better seats were reserved for Air New Zealand's richer passengers to choose from. Air New Zealand have brought in a policy of penny pinching now and trying to squeeze every last dollar out of you. You now have to pay for luggage, for a meal and even censored in flight entertainment of any quality - with the crew only offering water to us occasionally, while people around me were served meals and drinks etc that they had pre-purchased. To me, this would be fine on a short flight (1-2 hours) on a budget carrier, but not on flights exceeding 4 hours. I opted to pay $10 for all movies in the end, but was pretty disappointed to find that the film I watched had been heavily censored and there were constant interruptions every time an announcement was made (usually about food, or welcoming platinum members etc) and including annoying messages popping up on the screen during films and games. The check in at Auckland the next day was a disaster. Unless you were a business / premium passenger, you are forced to spend ages trying to use their automated check in machines that are very complicated and frustrating, then have to use another even more complicated machine to drop bags off. In both cases, we needed help from 3 members of staff. The ground staff were helpful and the cabin crews, although not particularly warm, did their job. Air New Zealand have a fleet of modern aircraft and the 2 Boeing 777 aircraft that we travelled on were clean, tidy and comfortable. At this stage, I will avoid Air New Zealand if travelling to or through New Zealand again. I'd rather go for a full service airline, not a budget airline.

### "the service was very slow"
Flew London Heathrow to Los Angeles. First time with Air New Zealand as we were recommended them but we were very disappointed with the staff on both journeys who were quite abrupt. I had a vegetarian meal, different dishes on both journeys but they looked and tasted the same. Didn't know what they were but they lacked thought and looked extremely bored and dated. You only get a blanket, pillow and head phones, with Virgin and Delta you got the full package with socks, earplugs, toothbrush and toothpaste. When you touched the screen to place an order no one came and when they did the service was very slow. Overall I will definitely go with Delta next time and give Air NZ a miss.

### "staff caring, food and drinks good"
First time with Air New Zealand to Buenos Aires as they just started flying this route in December. All staff have been great - starting from check-in and all the way through until my arrival to EZE. Lounge at Auckland airport was very crowded, not easy to find a seat but managed. Variety of food and drinks was good but because it was so crowded, some trays had no food left. Onboard the plane, staff very caring and food and drinks good. I do have some "nice" complaints. The first one is the toilet area which is was small for business class. My second complaint is the amenity kit. I love Air New Zealand but on this issue you lost my vote. Just few things inside the amenity kit, I even asked the flight attendant if something was missing, he even replied that was not the first time they asked him just that. A shaving kit would have been helpful, facial tissues, a comb-brush is also handy. But regardless of my nice complaints, I will carry on flying with you as much as I can.

### "some crew make or break it"
Melbourne - Buenos Aires via Auckland and return. MEL-AKL-MEL on B777-300ER and AKL-EZE-AKL on B777-200ER. Check in Melbourne a bit cold and unfriendly. MEL lounge being refurbished hence not best. MEL-AKL, NZ 123 left and arrived on time. Crew not bad. Excellent meals and entertainment. AKL lounge very crowded at that time of evening with many Americas Departures. AKL-EZE flight boarded on time but left a bit late, however managed to arrive on time into EZE. Delicious food and excellent crew. IFE quite good. Return from EZE. Lounge in EZE quite good. Y+ plus was empty and had around 25% load. Good Crew and Food. Last leg from AKL to MEL terrible crew. Very disappointing considering that all flights before that were good. Overall Air New Zealand is a good airline but some crew make or break it.

### "food was delicious"
I first flew with Air New Zealand about 8 years ago and back them I remembered I enjoyed them, so for my next trip I booked return flights to Buenos Aires. I cannot fault this airline. The service before getting on the flight was great and then the staff while on the plane were all so well mannered, lovely and nothing was too much to ask. The Cabin manager also had a sense of humour - which is often hard to find on a long haul flight. I was fortunate enough to be sitting on the Skycouch row so was able to use the 2 seats next to me and spread out. The seats themselves I would rate about the same as any other airline. The food was delicious. It came out hot and had lots of flavour- unlike other airlines. The inflight entertainment was also great. They had a great selection of movies and TV shows (even full TV series). Once again, I couldnt fault my experience on Air NZ and will be recommending them.

### "crews were very attentive "
Brisbane to San Francisco via Auckland with Air New Zealand. Both crews were very attentive and efficient, meals and wines excellent, planes left and arrived on time and slept well after dinner. Only issue was boarding at both BNE and AKL was a challenge, AKL is nearly always bad. New lounge in Brisbane not really any better than the old one except for the view and it is bigger, new lounge in AKL crowded but good, included a cocktail bar with decent drinks. Call from the AKL lounge was early and the gate was very crowded making priority boarding difficult. The area needs reconfiguration to be less of a battle to get on board. Other than that nothing else not to like, immigration in SFO was fast and the bags were waiting.

### "10 across makes for very narrow seats"
Flight left on time, Air New Zealand sold a seat I had booked 6 months ago, after some discussion a compromise was reached. I had a bulk head seat 48J. Food was excellent and cabin staff attentive. But 10 seats across on a 777 makes for very narrow seats, also at night walking to the toilets, you almost have to walk sideways to try and avoid bumping into people. Overall a good flight but would place Air New Zealand 3rd of the three airlines I used on my vacation, after Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines.

### "great airline to fly on"
Auckland to Wellington a short domestic with Air New Zealand. The cabin crew were friendly and the food was good. The A320 needed more inflight entertainment for children, a larger variety drink choices and more cabin crew since there were only 4. Still a great airline to fly on.

### "crew friendliness is fantastic"
Houston to Auckland with Air New Zealand - a fine airline indeed. The crew friendliness is fantastic. The food is passable in terms of both quality and size. The 777-200ER on the Pacific routes are a treat to fly. The seats are great, but not too much legroom. I got the back row so I had a great recline. I love the seat back snack and drink ordering system, it is quick, easy and efficient.

### "well worth the expense"
Paid for upgrade to premium economy which was well worth the expense for flight from Auckland to Melbourne with Air New Zealand. I'm a wide guy (140 kg, 5ft 7in tall) and really appreciated the wider seat and the extra space available to me. FAs very professional and friendly. Food was ok but not great. Thanks to the IFE system I managed to catch up on 5 episodes of a TV series that I had missed. With the IFE the was some annoying static / buzzing in the headphones. I swapped to my own and it was still there. Toilets very clean and I loved reading the book titles on the wall.

### "bit of a cheap experience "
Hong Kong to Auckland with Air New Zealand, which was the return leg of a short trip up to Asia from New Zealand. I had managed to secure an upgrade via one-up (Bidding with airpoints) to move from Premium Economy to Business. Whilst I was glad of the upgrade and the ability to lie flat on what was a comfortable bed I was very disappointed with some of the soft product on board. The catering was fairly dire with a hamburger being the best option available for the evening meal. When did Air New Zealand start outsourcing its catering function to a strip-mall burger joint. Cheeses to follow were inedible and while the wine was nice, it certainly was not free flowing. Felt a little bit of a cheap experience overall. The overall cost of the meal, including what passed as a starter, cannot have been more than $10. When the airfare is around 3-4k one way on this leg, I would expect more Crew on the flight were good (as is the norm on Air NZ) just being let down by having to serve a substandard product. I recommend Air NZ for their cheaper seats, not worth paying full business though.

### "it is profit before people"
Sydney to Auckland with Air New Zealand. Arrived Sydney early and told I couldn't change my flight to an earlier departure that was still open for check in. Tried to check in using the automated machines only to have my passport literally snatched out of my hand and taken to the manual check booth. Intervention was not required or appreciated. Seat on A320 is quite cramped and I only had a carry on baggage ticket so had to order a snack via the app. Entertainment options OK and easy to use. Really feel that it is profit before people with Air New Zealand now which is a pity. I have flown more miles with Air New Zealand than any other airline but this will be changing unless the price is significantly cheaper.

### "leg space was very good"
I found that this leg of my journey from England to New Zealand via Munich and Singapore, was easily the best leg. I had already been in transit for around 18 hours and had a 9hr 55min flight with Air New Zealand on a B787 Dreamliner. The food (3 meals) was pretty good and the IFE was of a very high standard and I felt that it was incredibly easy to use. The cabin cleanliness was also very well managed and I will say the same about the lavatories as well. Cleanliness of the entire cabin gets 5 stars. The Flight Crew were very friendly and treated everyone with the utmost respect. The flight itself was a little bumpy but that is innevitable on a long haul flight, turbulence was not a problem but did stop the Cabin Crew from serving drinks for a while, I felt that the Pilots handled it well and kept everyone properly updated. The Economy Class seats were very comfortable and were easy to fall asleep in, the cabin temperature was not too hot/not too cold and the leg space was very good. I did not use the inflight WiFi but others that did use it said it was very good.

### "attentive and friendly crews"
Tauranga - Los Angeles on NZ6 on 18 Feb with Air New Zealand. I used a recognition upgrade to go from Premium Economy to Business Class. Very nice regional lounge in Tauranga and a somewhat overcrowded new lounge in Auckland, but once you navigate around the Auckland lounge you can find a quiet spot. I was in the main Business Class cabin on the 777-300 and was attended by one of the most professional, attentive and friendly crews. Dinner and Breakfast was superb, along with an excellent selection of alcohol, which was constantly topped up. We arrived at LAX ahead of schedule.

### "friendly and helpful"
We recently went on a trip from the US to Australia and New Zealand. We were so pleased with the customer service Air New Zealand offered. A conflict arose with one portion of our trip and the customer service representatives were so great to work with to resolve this issue for us. The flight attendants on the plane were also very friendly and helpful. We also were very happy with the quality of the aircraft we flew on-convenient, comfortable, good food, and the bathrooms were nicer and cleaner than any other airline we have flown with (including on the long trans-Pacific flights).

### "a superb business class product"
San Francisco to Perth via Auckland on Air New Zealand. Boarding in SFO was orderly and quick. On board, the aircraft interior was in pristine condition. The FA's on both legs were simply outstanding in the service they provided as well as in how they engaged with the passengers. Seats were very comfortable although I prefer the ones on the B777 to those on B787 as they seem to offer more space. The seat in the flat-bed position is very comfortable thanks to the additional padding used when the seat is converted into the bed. Food and wine selection were great on both legs and the presentation was top notch. Bathrooms were kept clean throughout both flights. IFE had a wide range of movies and music to satisfy all tastes. The lounge in Auckland had great variety and the made-to-order coffee bar was a huge hit. Air New Zealand offers a superb business class product and I highly recommend them.

### "food was excellent"
We flew Air New Zealand in Business Premier from Melbourne to Auckland to Vancouver on April 8 and thought it was excellent. The lie-flat bed was very, very comfortable, allowing me to sleep for over seven hours on the AKL-YVR leg. The food was excellent, especially dinner, the lamb being of restaurant quality. Staff were very attentive and cheerful. Overall, an excellent experience, highly recommended.

### "in all a pleasant journey"
Auckland to Wellington. Checked in at the premium desk which was fast and friendly. Auckland domestic lounge pretty well stocked with food on the buffet so you could eat dinner before boarding. Lounge was very crowded and initially hard to find a seat. Flight was delayed by 40 minutes which meant we could have a whole meal and not just a snack. We were kept regularly informed re the delay and boarding was fast. Smiling and happy crew who interacted well with passengers, snacks and tea/coffee or water all that was on offer but fine for this short flight. Comfortable and clean aircraft and in all a pleasant journey. Bags took about 10 minutes and carousel was also very crowded.

### "service overall was very good"
We flew Air New Zealand outward from San Francisco to Auckland and back from Queenstown to London via Los Angeles. We chose them because of the Space Seats"in Premium Economy and were not disappointed. The seats were the extremely comfortable with plenty of leg room; meals were were tasty and offered good choice and the wine selection was good. The exceptional service offered by our cabin attendant on the outward journey to Aukland was not repeated on the return flight and I was a little taken aback when the attendant handed me my breakfast on a tray where the yoghurt had leaked with an apology but with no attempt to wipe up the spill. That said, service overall was very good and the crew were very pleasant. The in flight entertainment offered a wide choice of films, music etc. We would definitely fly with them again.

### "delightful staff, great snacks"
Singapore to Auckland with Air New Zealand. Check in good. Seat chosen not per the website plan so a middle row scenario. Not happy so complained and fortunately for all of us an aisle seat was available once I stood and waited 25 minutes until the aircraft was loaded. Delightful staff, great snacks but a long way off actual meal size. Screen snack ordering I loved and so fast! Very noisy vacuum toilets after 50 or so times it was a bit much. Two of the cabin crew were so big in the hips one hit me half a dozen times on the shoulder - I am pretty wide myself. They were lovely people ... but! Great flight, funny Pilot who had staff and passengers laughing. Next time Premium economy for me though.

### "a very pleasant flight"
Brisbane to Auckland with Air New Zealand was a very pleasant flight, cabin staff attentive and engaged. Check in reasonable with minor delay, lounge has seen better days in Brisbane but was the last week before the new lounge opened and was OK. Food good onboard, wine excellent. Left on time and arrived on time, bags off relatively fast.

### "everything is an upcharge"
Flew from Auckland to Perth. Everything is an upcharge on Air New Zealand, beginning at check in. Their peculiar system requires you to occupy only your assigned seat, which is how the cabin crew knows what you are entitled to. My codeshare (Virgin Australia) did not show up properly on the Air NZ system, so I was required to attempt to watch a movie in order to determine if I had to pay for a Coke. (I was.) Flight departed an hour late from AKL due to mechanical issues. Overall, very average for a carrier which (used to) get good reviews.

### "seats were roomy"
It was overall a good flight from Sydney to Wellington. Efficient check-in, seats were roomy with sufficient leg room and the crew are friendly and casual. A major let-down, however, is their bizarre pricing. In Economy class, you have the option of flying with carry-on only, with no meals, no movies, and no check-in luggage. For around 20% more, you get a 'package' of check-in luggage and meals. There is no option of buying the meal alone. As a frequent trans-Tasman flyer who only goes for a few days at a time, I almost always travel with carry-ons only. Clearly, it makes no sense to pay for the whole extra package for just the meals. That leaves me 3 options onboard: eat nothing, buy the unappealing pre-packaged food, or bring my own. As pleasant as the Air New Zealand flight has been, in the future I opt for the 4th option: flying Qantas, which is similarly priced but is full-service.

### "very attentive cabin staff"
Return flight to UK with Air New Zealand after 10 day visit to California. This airline was chosen on cost (very attractive seat sale) but they were certainly not budget in the service provided. The outbound flight on 18th February and this return flight were very similar in quality. Two well timed meals, a more than adequate IFE system and very attentive cabin staff (despite a somewhat unaccommodating fellow passenger next to me) made my first long haul flight in 17 years quite pleasant.

### "freezing most of flight"
Melbourne to Hawkes Bay, and Air condioning - absolutely freezing most of flight. Complained to air hostess who came back to report that the heating had been turned up. We as a party of 4 felt no difference even people in seats in front of us did not feel that the heating had been turned up. I have never felt so cold on a flight before and hope it doesnt happen again.

### "there are better options to US"
Brisbane to Los Angeles via Auckland and the flights were on time, ground staff average. The leg room is okay, but the 10 abreast seating is way too tight for such long flights. There are too many passengers crammed into the economy cabins, leaving very little space for cabin baggage in the overhead compartment. Service is nice but quite basic, no amenities offered or snacks. They need to be ordered via the app on the seat back TV. The meals were very small portions and meal trays with few options. The drinks selection was very good. PTV had many options. The flights were okay, but I couldn't recommend unless the price was substantially cheaper than other carriers. There are better options to the US.

### "IFE was excellent"
Air New Zealand, NZ 282, Auckland to Singapore on the new B787-9. Self check in counter on ground didn't work very well, a nice staff came and helped us. Boarding was smooth. Safety video was creative. The IFE was excellent, big screen, sensitive, many movies with different languages subtitles. A point to mention was you could order food in the IFE, it was convenient for passengers. Crew were nice and helpful. Dinner and breakfast were provided. Food was ok however quantity was small. Flight landed in Singapore on time.

### "booked upgraded and did not get"
Overall good between Auckland and San Fransico but Air New Zealand has a policy of making you recheck your baggage at every flight segment and charge baggage fees for every flight segment if the entire connecting set of flights don't all have the same ticket number. All travel with ANZ, all tickets issued by them, it made no difference. We had also paid for and booked upgraded seats months in advance which we simply did not get on the return flight - no explanation, just bad news for us but as I said, other that good.

### "a great experience"
Queenstown to Auckland, and first time with Air New Zealand and impressed! The aircraft was new, with a nice interior. The safety video was fun and engaging. Cabin communications frequent and detailed. Hostesses were friendly. Some cheese and drinks offered, for a not long domestic flight it's appreciated. No individual screens, but some quizzes on the shared screens. A great experience, only a shame that due to geography AKL cannot be an international hub.

### "would never recommend"
We made travel arrangements last July to travel from Sydney to Christchurch with Air New Zealand, we knew we would have bags but neglected to confirm prior to departure. Our email confirmation indicated baggage fees would apply but never in our wildest dreams did we expect to pay $160 (AUD) per bag at the airport. This was an international flight and quite often the cost of bags is no more than $50 per bag. We needed to check in online 120 minutes prior to departure but we didn't have internet access. The flight wasn't full but the agents were rude telling us that the airlines wanted to limit bags. Who goes on a 3 week adventure vacation in New Zealand without bags? Clothes and gear is paramount to this type of vacation and needless to say we spent thousands of dollars - not a great start to an amazing country by their airline. On the return flight after changing our reservation by phone and adding bags, they neglected to put our reservation change in computer and tried to charge us again. They wanted a printed confirmation, who carries a printer on vacation? Thankfully, we had an email confirmation. I would never recommend this airline.

### "entertainment system is excellent"
A real mixed bag with Air New Zealand from Auckland to Shanghai, great flight with bad ground service. The trip got off to a couple of bad starts, I couldn't check in from Queenstown to Geneva since the tickets were not connnected, so I had to drag my luggage between the terminals in Auckland. Then when I tried to check in for Geneva from Auckland they would only check me in to Shanghai since apparently Air NZ can not check people in to transit Shanghai to Air China. This needs to be fixed since I spent 2 hours in queues to get out and back into the airport in Shanghai, I would never fly this route again because of this problem. The terminal walkway in Auckland really needs to be covered since it is frequently raining, it is a bit of a national disgrace that uncovered walkway, not a good way to great arriving tourists. Flying the Dreamliner made this longhaul flight more pleasant, the higher humidity and cabin pressure left me feeling less drained than usual. The entertainment system is excellent with gate to gate service and a good selection of movies. Most importantly the system does not have boxes under the seats making a lot more legroom available. I was lucky to get a sky couch row to myself since the plane was only half full and was able to have the full sky couch to myself for sleeping. Having a full sky couch was great for sleeping, but honestly I can't see how 2 or more people could share one unless they are very short/small people or children.

### "happy with the flight"
Tokyo Narita to Auckland on NZ94. Boarding was efficient. Impressed with both the dinner and breakfast served, however only one beverage run with meals and if one wanted a second drink it had to be ordered via the AVOD app. Same with coffee and tea. Crew varied from jovial to sullen. Seat not the most comfortable but as I move around the cabin often this was not too big an issue. Excellent selecton of entertainment. Overall happy with the flight and would fly this route with Air New Zealand again.

### "definitely last time"
Singapore to Auckland, my first time taking Air New Zealand and definitely last time. The baggage policy for international flights is silly. While I respect the weight allowance of 23kg, it is ridiculous to restrict to 1 bag per pax even if total of 2 bags is still within weight allowance. Ground crew claimed to have no discretion to bend the rules though the flight was rather empty. For those who are travelling for golf or other sports, would be wise not to take this airline.

### "professional, friendly and helpful"
Los Angeles to London Heathrow on New Year's Day with Air New Zealand. Full cabin in Business Class. Love the seats and foot stool and conversion to flat bed. The seats have a good range of positions and the table is large enough. The entertainment system was fully operational. Food and beverage choices were very good. The flight attendants were professional, friendly and helpful - we can't speak highly enough of them, both outbound and inbound. The ground staff were also pleasant and helpful.

### "pretty good experience"
Flying return from Auckland to London Heathrow I had a pretty good experience. On my first flight, I didnt have a copy of the airline magazine, and asked the staff. They explained that something had happened and they hadn't been put on the flight. I wasn't originally best pleased. A week later, as I boarded my flight back to NZ, I presented my boarding pass while getting on the plane. The steward immediately said "David I've heard you missed out on the Kia Ora magazine last flight, we've got a copy here ready for you". They brought this to my seat a few minutes later, with another apology for not having it the first time.

### "staff were excellent"
I flew Air New Zealand from London to Los Angeles on Christmas Day, the staff were excellent. An empty seat opposite my seat was made up as my bed. Food very good. The use of the Singapore Airlines Lounge at Heathrow Terminal 2 is a great start to the flight.

### "food selection was ok"
Light passenger load in business class. Arrived at the gate after priority boarding had closed and queue with economy class. When staff realize they were embarrassed and work hard to ensure I was boarded first. Whilst it didn't bother me the effort was appreciated. The inflight service was impeccable. Staff turned an empty seat into bed for me rather than my assigned seat, very convenient. Food selection was ok but plenty to go around. There were only 10 pax in business class and 4 were friends or relatives of crew members. Inflight entertainment was ok. Bed was very comfortable to sleep but wish the width could be bit wider for turning. Would definitely fly Air New Zealand again.

### "comfortable flat bed"
Auckland to Los Angeles with Air New Zealand. Great service, good food, very comfortable flat bed, although somewhat finicky compared to other airlines in that it isn't simple to set up without help from service staff. Privacy is better achieved by getting a seat at rear bulkhead. Lounge at Auckland busy, but service staff walling around and offering snacks and drinks is a nice touch.

### "aisle is no longer wide enough"
I have flown between Auckland and Vancouver on Air New Zealand dozens of times. This was the first time on the new 3-4-3 seating arrangement. Total fail. I sat in an aisle seat, as always, and discovered the aisle is no longer wide enough for the average Kiwi. I am not a big person and there was no way to keep my shoulders in enough to prevent being continually bumped. Some of their stewardesses are wider than the aisles. Some men negotiated the aisles sideways. How can this be safe? I have been trying to find alternatives to this flight as the 3-4-3 seating arrangement is far too crowded for even "small" people. Can't imagine what it would be like for "large" people. Oh, and the food was not good. What a difference one year has made in my opinion of Air New Zealand. I would classify Air New Zealand as a budget airline except for the price doesn't reflect this, only the quality. I should mention however that the domestic flights are just fine.

### "787 is more of a nightmare"
The Air New Zealand Boeing 787 is more of a nightmare. Have never known such hard, uncomfortable and narrow seats in economy. I am of average build and there was hardly any room to shift one's position. I had paid extra for an emergency exit seat but this meant I was unable to lift the armrests to obtain just an inch of extra space. Also, I might have had more leg room but the noise from the galley and toilets made it impossible to sleep quite apart from being continually jostled by people using the very narrow aisle. The mostly Chinese crew appeared bored and seldom smiled - cannot really be blamed as I understand that is the only route they fly. The food was mediocre and served on the tiniest tray with plastic utensils. Coffee and tea was not offered after the dinner service and the return trip it was offered at breakfast but the coffee was of very poor quality. Air New Zealand management would do well to remember that the economy passengers are in the majority and by providing a cheese paring budget service people are going to look for other airlines that provide a more comfortable means of travel. I must also comment on the uniform. The male cabin crew have a lovely smart outfit but the female uniform is horrendous especially for those cabin crew who are on the buxom side. The uniform is ugly and badly fitting. I tried the Boeing 787 because I had heard good reports, but after two negative experiences (Auckland to Shanghai and Tokyo to Auckland) I shall return to flying with Singapore Airways, Cathay Pacific and even Qantas!

### "pleasant cabin ambiance"
From boarding to arrival an exceptional experience with Air New Zealand from YVR to AKL. Comfortable seat both in upright and fully flat configuration. Pleasant cabin ambiance with cool colours and fresh looking environment. Food choices were ample and my fish was prepared just right. Limited but good quality wines and a wide array of other beverages including champagne and several beer labels. FA's were nothing short of outstanding with smiles all around even after 14 hours in the air. IFE had a rich library of movies and music. Flight departed and landed on time.

### "most relaxing experience"
Travelled Works Deluxe and one of the most relaxing experiences in a long time. I arrived at Queenstown airport much earlier than I would normally check-in. As I entered the terminal an announcement was made to say that bags could be checked in then. I was able to use my passport to confirm checkin and drop my bag off, assisted by an Air New Zealand representative staff. I used the Koru lounge and enjoyed a very relaxing few hours. The lounge was not exceptionally busy although the number of people increased over the time I was waiting. Onboard I found the flight attendants excellent, very engaging with the announcements and safety messages, and the whole team were most professional.

### "Bumped from first flight"
Shanghai to Dunedin via Auckland. Unacceptable. Bumped from first international flight with instructions sent by email to obtain update on the phone - only a local number was given (and I was on hold forever). Last flight leg ultimately canceled. Sitting in the airport - first it was 15 minutes late, then late due to medical emergency, then late due to engineering problems, finally cancelled. Foreseeing this as the process unfolded, I asked if I could be put on another flight (there was one, it was not full). I was told that Air New Zealand had "a team" working on it, then (snottily) that "premium" customers would come first. At the end, big scramble at the gate with no apparent rhyme or reason about who was rescheduled (I was not). They cannot field a plane, but staff are able to be rude. Other flights were also cancelled while I was waiting (engineering problems). Many angry people here at the airport today. I previously travelled on Air New Zealand more often for work, and I have to say, this domestic flight scheduling/delivery problem coupled with rude ground staff seems to be more frequent than the on-line statistics that I see suggest. My overall rating is a 2 because of staff inability to deal with frustrated customers in a calm and supportive manner (rather the opposite).

### "not impressed at all"
Recently flew the last leg of Auckland / London Heathrow round trip with Air New Zealand. All the other legs with Cathy Pacific. Not impressed at all with the business class seating on the 777-200 its hopeless. No privacy whatsoever compared to Cathy Pacific. Due to the inward aisle seating arrangement had at least six people peering at me and visa versa. Not a pleasant experience at all especially at meal times. Food was fine as where the crew on Air New Zealand but thats all. Cathy Pacific 777-300 seating was excellent and the full flat bed was superior to Air New Zealand and it needs no assistance from the crew, unlike Air New Zealand's complicated issue just to break out the bed. Price wise I paid Cathy Pacific around 14,000 NZ dollars for the trip for 2 adults and if I had gone via the US with ANZ they wanted 23,000 NZ dollars. Hence the ANZ rip off. Cathy Pacific for me in the future and I am saying that as a Kiwi

### "I had great flights"
I had great flights with Air New Zealand, but didn't like was having to transit through LAX on my outward journey. In spite of some improvements LAX is still a nightmare. I returned from Auckland to Singapore on AirNZ and transferred to Singapore Airlines for the second half of the journey. The flight attendants on both airlines are great but I found the food, wine, seat and IFE are superior on Air NZ. They also provided a nice amenity bag.

### "booking system putting us off"
Melbourne to Cork via Auckland, Los Angeles and London. We use Air New Zealand on two or three round trips pa because of its excellent Premium Economy offering. Better seating than other airlines PE on this route. Staff are good and lounges and shower facilities good where operated by Air NZ. Having to transit LA is not as good as it used to be via Hong Kong due to poor airport arrangements and US lack of good transit arrangements. The online booking system really lets Air New Zealand down badly. Try booking from Cork in Ireland and it consistently says no flights are available. Talk to the call centre and their system shows passengers departing Cork having to fly to London then to Vancouver or San Francisco with a connecting flight to join NZ1 in LA. This is despite the Air New Zealand flight (NZ1) leaving from the same terminal in Heathrow as the inbound flight from Cork to Heathrow arrives at! Try booking from London on the same date and NZ1 is available. I have written three times to Air New Zealand about this systems problem, including once to their CEO, and have received absolutely no response and the system problem still remains. Very poor service from an airline that otherwise is good. The result is that for our next flight we are using Singapore Airlines Business Class which was only £200 more than Air New Zealand Premium Economy. Businesses are only as good as their weakest point. The booking system is putting us off Air New Zealand.

### "impressed by the service"
This was the first time I had flown with ANZ and impressed by the service. I was originally supposed to fly from Auckland to Paraparaumu, got to the airport and the flight was cancelled. Air New Zealand had automatically booked me on the Wellington flight and arranged a car from Wellington Airport to Paraparaumu. Flight was smooth, inflight service was great, crew friendly and professional. Highly recommended.

### "felt like a budget airline"
Singapore to Auckland on Boeing 787. Felt crammed with seats and very narrow aisles. Sitting by the aisle meant being bumped and pushed by people going past including one of the cabin crew – a big man who banged into me every time he passed and kicked my foot once with never an apology. Seat pitch was OK because the seats are very thin with little padding. Seat belts aren’t very long and if you’re a larger person the buckle is under the armrest which is uncomfortable and awkward to access. IFE was good but no inflight magazine and no entertainment listing. All you get is a food price list and a safety card which was better than the All Blacks safety video. Explored the onscreen offerings which weren’t well laid out. I stumbled on a good TV program that popped up on the screen but couldn’t find tell my partner how to access it. There’s no menu card or indication of what meals and drink service is offered. As one of the cabin crew grumpily instructed the passenger next to us, you have to use the online screen to order a drink. Having figured it out I ordered two drinks and some vege chips (the only food item besides a pre-packed cookie available without paying for it). After a while one of the drinks arrived but not the other one. We asked if it was coming and were told it should be. However it didn’t. Eventually my partner decided to order it again but they’d closed the kitchen. So I rang and asked for the drink. Steward wasn’t happy but finally came back took the order and went and fetched the drink. The food was mediocre served with plastic cutlery on tiny trays. The sparkling and the white wine was shocking quality. The cabin crew service was perfunctory and bored. We never once saw any of them smile and I barely got a muttered Sorry when a stewardess split wine on me. What a contrast to our flight on Singapore Airlines a fortnight earlier when smiling, pleasant staff welcome you on board and offer hot towels before you even take off. You get inflight magazines with a full entertainment guide, complimentary socks/toothpaste amenities in a little zip bag, pre-dinner drinks service with nuts, a printed menu listing the meals, drinks and snacks offered, and proper meal try with metal cutlery. We haven’t travelled Air New Zealand for a while and won’t be again. It felt like a budget airline cutting costs at every opportunity. We’ll go back to booking the Asian airlines with their superior and friendly service.

### "crew were very attentive"
Auckland to Singapore with Air New Zealand. The aircraft was new and comfortable. Take off and landing very smooth. Cabin crew were very attentive. Plane was about 90% full but pleasant atmosphere was maintained. Supper was okay and breakfast was good. Entertainment selection not so impressive

### "a budget airline service"
I had booked into economy for Auckland to Brisbane. Air New Zealand uses a self check in system, only problem being half of the computer had out order signs so not great start. Boarding the aircraft was fine. Air NZ then tell the everyone they have just won an award for service then followed it with poor to average service - to the extent that when order snack from their new ordering system it kept coming up kitchen closed. I the asked a steward if I am able to order a snack, his reply was we are too busy for Taking food order. I then waited 30 mins and tried again still kitchen closed, so I asked another steward and his response was it closed as their no hot food left. I told him I just wanted a snack, he agreed to letting me order a snack, I go tell him what I want unfortunately he could not take my request and said I had to order via the seat back screen once he clicked to open the kitchen again. Which I did and finally got my order. The entertainment onboard was limited unless you wished to pay 10NZDfor a movie. Air New Zealand is an overpriced for what is basically a budget airline service. If it wasn't for the timing I would have flown Emirates, Qantas or China Airlines for the same money. I would say I wouldn't fly Air NZ again but unfortunately I have Cathay Pacific flight booked and they sneaked an Air New Zealand flight in there - hopefully it will be lot better experience.

### "awful domestic flight experience"
An awful domestic flight experience, from Queenstown to Rotorua via Wellington. Small plane with cramped seating. Small overhead luggage compartments. Poor service - only one or 2 attendants on our 2 flights who gave minimal service. No lunch provided on 2.5 hr flight, half cup of water, and hard candy. Desk agent in Wellington never kept us updated about incoming delayed flight. I thought I was flying on a US carrier! Not at all like the Qantas flights we used otherwise.

### "seat is very comfortable"
Flew Los Angeles to London in the Air New Zealand Premium Economy "space seat" and was pleasantly surprised. We were treated better in Premium Economy than we have been in Business class on some airlines. Priority check-in, boarding, luggage. The seat is very comfortable even though the recline is limited. But it is wide enough and has enough room to stretch out in several different positions. They give you a brochure to show you the many different options. The IFE was excellent and cabin crew was outstanding. Food was very good and plentiful. The separate cabin with its own lavs made it feel private. (Even music in the laws!) We tried this class of service to decide whether or not to spend the money on Business for our two upcoming European trips. We decided we would rather change planes in LHR and stay in Premium Economy than to pay thousands more for Business.

### "crew were nice and kind"
Los Angeles to London on their Boeing 777. We would vote the maximum for Air New Zealand. The aircraft was new and super clean, the crew were nice and kind, and also never absent in the cabin for a long time. The meals were tasty, and the inflight entertainment was individual PTV with plenty of movies, series and games. A peaceful, nice, and entertaining flight!

### "seat was comfortable"
First time flying in new Boeing 777-200ER configuration. Flight on time and was packed in all classes. Inflight entertainment is some of the best with good responsiveness and seat was comfortable with enough legroom. Did not notice the 3x4x3 configuration, although aisles are slightly narrower. Service as expected, food average, but a big thumbs up for the new configuration.

### "overall, a great experience"
Traveled Air New Zealand premium economy Auckland to Hong Kong to Auckland recently. Flights were on the recently new refurbished Boeing 777-200. Seats on these have better width and were quite comfortable. Service on both flights was suberb, meals vey nice and good wines. Plenty of movies to choose from. Overall, a great experience.

### "was disappointing"
Brisbane to Auckland was disappointing. Air New Zealand came highly rated and despite being in Economy I was hoping for a well serviced flight in modest comfort. A full aircraft didn't help but the staff were indifferent and clearly tired, such that we barely saw them. This much hyped airline needs to ensure their economy passengers get a better standard of care than was evident on this flight.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Excellent service from Auckland to Tokyo, being greeted by name and provided with a personable and relaxed service. IFE had an excellent selection and the ability to log in with my Airpoints number to store movie selections is a wonderful feature. The mugs were a nice touch too.

### "a big thumbs up"
I traveled on the new Air New Zealand Bombardier service from Auckland to Rotorua. So much more space and comfort on this aircraft .Great cabin crew member, very interesting, professional safety demo. Flight was almost full and a quick 35 mins later we reached our destination. All in all a big thumbs up.

### "staff were very friendly"
This was my first flight on Air New Zealand's premium economy (not space seat but new for 787's and new 777-200's). I normally fly business on this route as I fly it one a week. I tried premium economy and found it very good. The staff were very friendly and the meals great. IFE pretty good but I think Air New Zealand should put cameras on their planes so that their passengers can see the view from the outside (especially if you are in the middle rows). Great flight and I would definitely day on it again. I would still go Business class though on these flights because of the lie flat bed.

### "disappointed at Premium Check in"
I was very disappointed at the Air NZ Premium Ccheck in at Auckland on 3rd October. There was some difficulty with my not having a return ticket and I found both staff quite abrupt, if not rude. Both the male staff on duty were very difficult to understand. The flight was a Boeing 767 so Business class seating is not that good, I would put the comfort on the same level as business class on Jetstar's Boeing 787to the same destination. The service however is what sets Air NZ business above others. The food on this 8.5 hour trip seemed non stop. and very good quality. It is not often however I complain about being ahead of schedule on a flight, but I arranged my driver for a pickup in Bali, and on departure (just as we were told to turn off our cellphones) they announced the flight was going to arrive an hour early. Why they could not have told us that earlier to allow arrangements at the other end?

### "seats so narrow and squashed"
San Francisco to Auckland on Air New Zealand Boeing 777-300 in economy class. Check in and boarding in SFO was okay and quite efficient, staff greeted us nicely onto the plane. But then things got bleak with the seats. They are so narrow and squashed, laid out 10-across the cabin. The aisles were real narrow and staff and other passengers kept bumping my elbow through the flight as they walked past. Onboard entertainment was good, the food was just so-so, and staff were good to start the flight. Once meal as cleared they seemed too tired to come around and offer water etc, and my call button was not answered twice and so I walked to the kitchen to ask for drink. Ticket was quite cheap for flight length, but I will try to avoid these seats in future if possible.

### "enjoyed the Spaceseat comfort"
Chose Air New Zealand based on a friend's suggestion. The crew were extremely welcoming and professional, and we were even addressed by name by our FA during flight from LAX-AKL. Mostly enjoyed the premium economy Spaceseat comfort (adding a footrest would complete the design). Food was much better than expected and plenty of it. I'm sure our experience in Premium Economy was vastly different from those in Economy, where Air New Zealand has 10 across seating on the Boeing 777.

### "flight crew were excellent, food was good"
Air New Zealand operates two versions of the 777. The older ones have 9 seats in each row (3x3x3), the newer 10 seats (3x4x3). This was my first time on the 10 seat flight and NZ's made a terrible decision. The aisles are too narrow for anyone to walk down without bopping those in aisle seats-like me. Other aspects of the seat (pitch, width, recline) were fine. Flight crew were excellent, food was good. IFE is improving, but still not as up-to-date as many other internationally focused carriers. If a competing carrier were to enter the NZ/USA market with non-stop flights and a less crowded cabin, NZ's profitability will suffer.

### "enjoyable flight on Boeing 787"
Shanghai-Auckland with Air New Zealand. Enjoyable flight on the new Boeing 787. Excellent selection of music and movies. Dinner and breakfast served, and both meals satisfactory apart from the breakfast eggs which had a slight fishy taste. Crew generally good, but felt that a few were just going through the motions. Plenty of water runs. Overall a good experience and would fly again.

### "they've burned off any loyalty I felt"
Noumea to Auckland with Air New Zealand. The Works offering : A320 fitted with PTVs and flight arrived early in to Auckland (flight only 1.55 hours, nominally 2.40h flight). However, no webcheck available for this code share. Stressed cabin crew, crumbs on seat, rushed unintelligible announcements (no bilingual crew). Had to suffer the All Blacks 'Men in Black' inspired safety video and crowing how Air Air New Zealand is a multi-award winning airline, including 2015 Airline of the Year - (not Skytrax, but some unheard of airline rating). Lunch served straight after take off. Food options were a chicken salad or a lamb casserole. The lamb casserole was an abomination. Swimming in lanolin. Accompanied by a bread roll to soak up the fat and a shrink-wrapped industrial cake slice for dessert. One glass of red wine offered (no refills offered to passengers,) and no tea/coffee service offered. Crew still found time to disappear for approx.40 minutes, reappearing for descent. And still no tea or coffee offered. Contrast this to my AirCalin operated flight which was as near perfect a shorthaul flight as one could wish for. My partner is top tier FF with Air NZ and I have a partner card entitling me to perks such as additional baggage, lounge access, priority boarding, premium check in. Still chose AirCalin over Air New Zealand for this trip as the AirCalin  full service tickets are cheaper for a far superior inflight product. Air New Zealand appear to have applied rampant cost cutting to the point where they've burned off any loyalty I felt.

### "worst experience with Air New Zealand"
We had the worst experience with Air New Zealand flying from San Francisco to Auckland on NZ7. When entering the aircraft, all overhead lockers closed and no Flight Attendant to assist. Went to the rear galley to find two staff, who advised no place to stow our cabin bags. Just ignored me then after several minutes one said I will stow it. Went to my seat. My wife had hers in her lap. 10 minutes later another attendant comes though with my bag asking who left the bag? I advised the other attendant said she would stow it. He then went off to find the original attendant and she stowed in in another locker away from mine. After dinner was served, just at our row ran out of wine and left with the cart to get some more. Then came back and went past us? Ten minutes later the attendant notices my wife and I as well as the window seat without a drink with our dinner, and asks did we forget you? Took our drink orders and then came back. By this time I was done with dinner. Cabin crew through the whole flight were just going through the motions. Not many smiles, or friendliness. When leaving the aircraft at AKL I handed my Air NZ Air Points Card to the attendant who gave us such poor service and said give this to the Flight Manager and advise that you have lost a customer as your service stinks. Upon arrival at AKL at 0555, at baggage claim they announce apologies will be a delay getting the bags off the plane. Twenty five minutes later they came. By then several other flights arrived and the Customs Hall looked like a mini version of LAX. By the time we got through and took the shuttle bus to the AIR NZ Domestic Terminal we missed our connecting slight to Dunedin that morning. The Air New Zealand counters were full of other delayed passengers. The first Air New Zealand agent tried to assist and said we have to wait until 6:05pm that night for a flight. Over ten hours wait! No compensation, hotel, etc. She then could not get us booked on the computer and ran away for assistance somewhere. 20 minutes later came back and advised another agent would come and help us and left. After waiting around thirty minutes I lined up and got to meet the Supervisor to advise her it looked like we had been abandoned? She apologised and booked us on the flight that night and gave us $18.00 of food vouchers for the two of us, for our 10.5 hour wait on the leather covered benches in the Air New Zealand  Domestic Terminal.

### Air New Zealand customer review
This is a review regarding Air NZ before we boarded: Just prior to check-in we received a message that our flight from Sydney to Rarotonga was delayed for 12 hours. We had to checkout through customs and get our suitcases back. After about 2 hours of waiting one of the staff members announced that the closest accommodation available was 1.5 drive away, this was because it was Bledisloe Cup night in Sydney. They also said another option was that they would make arrangements for us to rest/sleep at the airport. We thought that by the time we drive to the accommodation and settle the kids down to sleep then it wouldn’t be long before we had to wake up and get organized and drive back to the airport. We decided to stay at the airport as it was now midnight and our young kids (and us) just wanted to sleep. When we arrived at the ‘area’ which Air NZ said they would make available for us we just couldn’t believe it. We had be taken to one of the airports main entrances with hardfloor tiles and we were crammed in with 200 other people. It was like a bad dream. It was a very long/cold horrible night. Finally the time came to check-in again and we went through customs. We had Duty Free bottles with us from the previous days check-in. At the customs 'bag screening' we were kindly told that Air NZ should not have neglected in telling us that our Duty Free bottles should have been packed in our checked-in luggage before re-entering customs again. They confiscated our Duty Free, took a copy of one of our boarding passes and encouraged us to go and see the Duty Manager of Air NZ and they would sort it for us. We did this and the Air NZ staff were very understanding of our situation and said they would arrange to go and pick up the Duty Free from customs and get it on our flight. When we were boarding the plane to Raro the Duty Manager approached us and totally confirmed that our Duty Free was sorted and we can pick it up at the Fragile Luggage area at Raro Airport. When we arrived at Rarotonga unfortunately our Duty Free hadn’t made it on the plane at all. The lovely staff at Rarotonga made notes and said she would contact Air NZ in Sydney for us. The next day we got a phonecall and apparently our Duty Free was still sitting in Sydney airport waiting for someone from Air NZ to go and pick it up and put it on a plane to Rarotonga. After many enquiries from us it never turned up at Rarotonga which was disappointing. Air NZ staff were always very polite however it was the lack of 'follow-through' and unfullfillled expectations on Air NZ’s part which we feel extremely let down by.

### Air New Zealand customer review
The seat was comfortable because they add a foam mattress after extending the bed. The food was excellent, and the crew were lovely, cheerful and helpful. I have experienced crews on other airlines either making me feel like an idiot because I could not operate something, or acting put upon when I ask for help reaching the overhead bin (I am 5 feet tall and reaching retirement age).

### Air New Zealand customer review
I like their simple cabin design and the service. Luckily, I got a ticket at a reasonable price at that time. Cabin crews were polite and seats are quite comfy, considering it was an economy class.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Unbelievably uncomfortable seating in a 3-4-3 configuration. I can see why the nickname is "Cripple 7". Also aisles are so narrow that it would be dangerous in an emergency. Asked the airline after a previous flight if it was in fact safe and got a form reply about "meeting international standards". Won't be doing this again although I have travelled a lot on AirNZ in the past (when they were a better airline). Cabin crew seem dispirited and indifferent - don't blame them.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Stopped flying premium economy when they alternated 777-300 and 777-200 usually without warning and the premium economy on the 200 was basically the same as economy but at twice the price. So now it's economy as business is ridiculously expensive. Flew August 6. Seat was narrow and hard and pitch angle meant seat in front was 3 inches from my nose. 3-4-3 seating does not work at all plus some of the toilets seemed to have been removed to get more seats in. Also seats are arranged so that if in the aisle seat which I was you can not put your legs out straight in front of you but must sit at an angle which is bad on a 13 hour flight. Safety video was too cute and irritating for words. At least they have got over their Lord of the Rings obsession but they need to focus on having a safety video to give safety information and forget the amateurish attempts at entertainment and use the money saved to fix the product.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Travelled to San Francisco via Auckland from Melbourne with 2 adults and 2 children (8 and 2) in Premium Economy. We had been given complimentary use of lounge in Melbourne. The crew were fantastic . Transfered after a 2 hour layover in Auckland for our flight to San Francisco. The food was Ok but the childrens meals left a lot to be desired. They only had once choice option so lucky we took snacks with us for them. Again service from the crew was wonderful. The space seats were great for the kids to sleep in. Maybe they could recline a bit more but on the whole they were great. Our return flight from Los Angeles was okay, but when we arrived in Auckland they did not have out stroller waiting for us. After a lot of confusion we were told it had been put in the cargo hold and was being transferred to our flight to Australia. Having a 2.5 layover in Auckland with a tired grumpy child is not pleasant, but when we boarded the flight home we were given our seats but not the extra things you get when you travel Premium Economy. No noise cancelling headphones and the children got their meals - but we didn't, until we complained. Our experience coming home was very disappointing. On complaining to Air New Zealand all we got for compensation were some airport dollars awarded to my account.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Fantastic service as always with Air NZ. Seat quality and aeroplane upkeep was excellent. Good meals, although I slept through one. When I asked for a snack later, friendly staff took me down to the galley, and let me choose a tray of whatever I liked. I needed some assistance connecting my phone, and again, the staff handled it all for me. Didn't push the business class priority to the point that made economy 3rd class citizens, staff were friendly and welcoming throughout.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Auckland to Christchurch return on A320. Flight to Christchurch Koru Hour flight meaning alcoholic beverages and Cheese and cracker or vegetable crisps served. Bags out quickly at Christchurch. Flight to Auckland biscuits or vegetable crisps served along with tea/coffee or water. Bags out after 25 minutes. Seat room pretty good. However for the very tall, could be issue. Flight fast lasting about an hour in both directions. Seated in 23F and 23A respectively. Good value flight for the duration.

### Air New Zealand customer review
3 hour hop across Tasman left on time and arrived ahead of time. Meal served plus drinks water and coffee. Flight crew excellent always available and friendly during service. Entertainment has loads of offerings and choices.

### Air New Zealand customer review
After delayed arrival of connecting inbound flight it was always going to be a rush to catch Air NZ flight in Melbourne but Air NZ made sure all connecting passengers were on board before departure. Service was fine and a meal offered and drinks. Lots of movies and shows to watch for 3 hour hop across Tasman arriving on time back in Christchurch. It was always going to be a struggle and none of the delayed passengers luggage made the connection so remained in Melbourne. It is moments like this that AIR NZ customer service comes to the front and you can see why they look after their passengers. Details were taken and arrangements made with bags placed on the next flight arriving in late at night. Air NZ called first thing to advise bags had arrived and would be delivered that morning by van. Don't blame Air NZ for bags missing flight and the efforts to make sure the delay was kept to a minimum was good.

### Air New Zealand customer review
It had been some time since I used this airline and I did so with hesitation as I had had bad experiences in the past. I now regret giving them another chance as I had another bad experience. Check-in was fine and boarding prompt if mechanical. The seats were shockingly narrow. The catering was OK but a far cry from experiences on Asian rivals and certain European airlines for that matter. The cabin crew were efficient enough but robotic in many respects. After such a long flight I was tired and very uncomfortable. In the good old days Air New Zealand used a wonderful Boeing 747 on this route and had a generous baggage allowance. Time have changed and not for the better either. I will not use this airline again!

### Air New Zealand customer review
I do five return trips from NZ to N America and usually one to Europe. I usually seek out the older aircraft with the more comfortable 3-3-3 seating on which I usually sleep at least six hours in an aisle seat. This time however was different. On the new 10 abreast B777 with the narrow seats, armrests and aisles. My usual aisle seat was most uncomfortable. It seems that the corporate policy is to strip the dignity of the majority of the passengers in order to promote higher profits up front. I am now considering having window seats but wearing nappies which would be more dignified - I look forward to more competition on these routes.

### Air New Zealand customer review
LAX to AKL. This was a superb flight thanks to a professional crew and modern aircraft. Meal choices of a high standard. There was a choice of snacks and drinks available, and staff available throughout the flight. The mattress on the lie flat bed makes a difference.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Two wonderful flights with engaging and helpful crews. Check in agent a little off hand and only issued connecting boarding pass for one of us. LAX Star Alliance lounge run by Air NZ much more pleasant then the old T2 lounge, NZ 5 flight left on time, meals and wines excellent. Slept very well. Connected with NZ 135 also left on time and Auckland lounge was good, food better that usual for breakfast although didn't need more than a snack. Flight to Brisbane equally competent. IFE on both excellent choice although only had the new system on NZ 5 which is a vast improvement on the old one. Bags off promptly and out of the airport in 15 minutes.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Again it was a joy to use the airlines Premium Economy cabin. It's a pity that other airlines do not follow Air New Zealand's lead in this product. The crew were brilliant as was the food. Will always choose this airline against others because of this product

### Air New Zealand customer review
Our initial flight was delayed by over 3 hours with very little explanation as to why. This meant that we missed our internal US connecting flight and had to spend the first night of our honeymoon bedded down at LAX airport. Because connecting flight was not packaged with ANZ, they were not in the slightest bit interested in helping us out. Complaint email took 6 days to get a response. When it came, it basically said 'tough'. Will never fly with them again and suggest anybody booked with them beware.

### Air New Zealand customer review
On 12 May I went to board a flight to Brisbane departing at 9pm. At no time was I informed I would be travelling on a Virgin plane with no inflight entertainment and a meal and drinks service that was all delivered in the first hour of the flight. Then we were told the lights would be off so we could rest. I didn't notice any children. The seats were uncomfortable with little padding. We were I offered ipads to watch the movie. I declined as I prefer the other things usually on offer. The plane was noisy and vibrated. I paid for The Works and don't feel at all satisfied with what I received.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Los Angeles to Auckland Business class. Air NZ have a great business class product very comfortable seats and staff lay out the bed with a mattress topper. Good IFE and food pretty good. Best thing was the staff so friendly and seem to really enjoy their job compared to all the other airlines we use over the years. Nothing is too much trouble for them.

### Air New Zealand customer review
21/2/2015. ANZ 87. Auckland to Hong Kong. We boarded the 777 on time ready for take off the captain the informed us there would be a slight delay due to technical issues. 2 hrs later still sat on the plane the captain asked us to return to the terminal as the aircraft wasn't able to take off and we would have to fly later on a replacement plane. On returning to the terminal two staff were trying to deal with passengers concerns it was total chaos we were told our flight was now 7am. We were given a blanket and expected to sleep on the floor my wife and I are senior citizens. At 4 am we were given beverage vouchers Auckland Airports catering facilities are very poor from midnight to early morning. Communication was very poor and eventually after 7am told we would now be leaving at 9.30am. We eventually left at 10.30 am on 777 which was old poor seats inflight entertainment poor and food very poor. Due to the 10.5 hour delay we missed our connection to LHR. Air New Zealand is based at Auckland airport so you would expect them to be better organised there. As a long haul airline I would never use them again after this experience.

### Air New Zealand customer review
AKL-SIN in P/E. Overnight flight. Air NZ's P/E seats have varied over the past few years depending on aircraft type and routes. These former business-class-style leather seats are extremely comfortable. The only drawback is the footrest which is awkward. Main advantage in P/E is the legroom and space. Our view is that all seats should be like this. Economy cattle class now really is horrible. Air NZ's business class is superb but so much pricier. P/E is well worth the extra cost. If you are hesitating just try it. How nice to have a personal "Kia ora" message on your screen. Air NZ's safety video remains hmm quirky though some passengers now find it a little OTT and are fed up with the continued hyping of the Lord of the Rings movies. IFE was only adequate and offerings could have been more comprehensive. Food was excellent. It did seem unnecessary for the FAs to have to make two separate trips to serve up appetizers and main courses when one excursion would have sufficed. Not really a fan of overnight flights if arriving early in the morning (not the case if flying the other direction) as you have to wait hours to get into your hotel. I only doze or sleep an hour or so on flights. We had traveled to Auckland from Christchurch. A direct SQ flight in P/E when/if available (scheduled for September 2015) would be worth considering if you do not need to travel out of Auckland.

### Air New Zealand customer review
NZ104 19 April SYD-AKL on the Dreamliner. The team in the business class cabin worked non stop during this relatively short flight delivering excellent service. The plane which was apparently Air New Zealands launch 787 was still new and abounded in technology. There is now a marked difference in the video entertainment system compared to other aircraft. The video screen is now High Definition and is like using a smartphone app. One thing you do immediately notice in the cabin is the size of the windows the cabin had a nice open feeling and the dimming feature meant that you could set the lighting to almost any setting that was comfortable. The meals included some of Peter Gordons creations the poached chicken salad was huge and did me for the rest of the day.

### Air New Zealand customer review
20/4/2015 Flight SQ4282. I booked a trip AKL to London with Singapore Airlines one of the flights offered for the first leg was a codeshare with Air NZ as the operator late night departure suited best so it was booked. Arrived at the airport to find one check in desk aircrew only self check points for everyone else I queried this and the solution to check in involved 1 staff member using 4 different self check points. Seated on board I looked for a flight magazine in the seat pocket were a safety sheet a sick bag and a dog eared price list for snacks such as nuts crisps etc once airborne the drinks trolley appeared some turbulence was encountered minor in my experience and the drinks trolley quickly disappeared followed by an announcement that serving drinks was not possible sometime later a tray appeared with a choice of water or orange this was to be the only time this service was offered during the 10+ hour flight. Some time later a meal was served complete with plastic cutlery nothing wrong with the meal some even got coffee however the tray remained uncollected shortly before landing I was handed a breakfast tray which I placed on top of the debris on the previous meal tray since no offer to remove it was forthcoming and the trolley moved on. Singapore to London with Singapore Airlines was a somewhat different experience I arrived at the airport after a short stopover in Singapore to find 7 manned check in desks I walked away from the desk with a boarding card in under 15 seconds. Seated on board I find no fewer than 3 different S.A. magazines the following items were then offered seperately in this order during the flight - while still on the ground hot towels were offered - socks package for the late night flight-newly printed menu also containing a list of complimentary snacks available on request such as nuts crisps etc nuts-drinks-meal with metal cutlery coffee/tea-water-waterx2-waterx3-hot towels-collect rubbish-breakfast coffee/tea. The return trip LHR to AKL with S.A. was a similar pleasant experience. Anyone out there booked to fly Air New Zealand? Good luck with that one!

### Air New Zealand customer review
AKL to LAX on May 9. Great service. When flying economy on Air New Zealand's 777-300 I always choose one of the pairs of seats at the very back of the plane usually the second or third forward from the back. It's a bit tight in economy and the aisle is wider there. Crew were awesome. Food was fine. Price paid on one of the airlines many sales was excellent.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flew AKL-PVG on the 787-9. Seat was very comfortable for sitting: a bit more recline would've made it excellent. But for sleeping 'twas marvellous: so comfortable. Crew were attentive and dinner was good breakfast (waffle) was horrid.

NZ 87 9th April Auckland - Hong Kong. A dreadful flight poor service indifferent staff food quality below par. No flight announcements to advise of flight being really bumpy flight crew could at least have said something. Air New Zealand used to be a reasonable airline and their domestic service still is but internationally they are now very poor.

Terrible customer service at Sydney Airport from Air New Zealand after a flight from Wellington on 21/4/15. They could not open the door of the baggage hold due to bad weather that may or not have been avoidable however the Air NZ support and information about the issue to those 30 or so passengers affected was woeful. For three hours we waited and then told that the bags were on their way back to NZ no one from Air NZ arrived in the arrivals baggage area to talk to us. No information about how we would eventually receive our bags until a 3rd hand message after 3 hours that they would get them to our address. While we waited those 3 hours six flights from other airlines arrived and received their luggage with no issue. A separate issue but same flight we thought there was a real lack of advertised hot food. The only two option on the menu for purchase ran out within 5 minutes of the meal service opening.

Don't bother paying extra for the Air NZ Works Deluxe experience. We decided to splurge on our return Sydney- Auckland flight and pay the extra for a works deluxe seat. At $450 it was nearly three times the cost of our outbound no food no bags flight with Virgin. Never again! The Premium check-in queue turned out to be slower than the 'normal' queues. The Sydney lounge is utterly awful worn out furniture (holes in the arms of chair I sat in) and dreadful food. Yes the drinks are free but t's a huge price to pay for a couple of G&Ts. Yes having a guaranteed spare seat beside us was good but we had that on our cheap Virgin flight out. The food was very lack- lustre and you had to really make an effort to get a second drink. They even forgot my meal though that was quickly rectified once I was able to get hold of a staff member. My advice is to save your money and fly economy.

Flew LAX to AKL and return first leg in Business return in premium economy. The Business class is world class crews are excellent food was excellent and the seat while a unique design really gives comfort and privacy. Sleep is necessary on a 13 hr flight that leaves at 10pm and it was easy. the spaces eat on the return leg gives privacy and space but i found the lack of recline made sleep difficult. Again food and crews were excellent. The 777-300 is a great plane with a lot of space but frankly I can't imagine this trip in economy.

We travelled premium economy Melbourne to LA. It cost about double the economy return. The first leg (to Auckland) wasn't called premium economy although it was in the premium economy cabin and we paid for premium economy. It was called something like 'Works Plus' and you only got economy food. At Melbourne airport we were prevented from priority boarding because of this difference which seemed a bit pathetic. The great advantage of premium economy on Air NZ is that you get plenty of room and the seat in front can't recline into your space. The seats are not great there is no footrest and the seat doesn't flip up to support your feet. On the long flight you are given sort of foot-bean-bags which are quite handy but you aren't given those on the shorter leg. In fact on the first leg I had to be quite insistent to beg for a couple of ordinary cushions from a flight attendant who was very reluctant to hand them over! The seats are actually hard to operate which the staff are clearly aware of. A problem with the seats is that they all face slightly or considerably away from each other. Perhaps this is meant to be for privacy but personally I prefer to sit parallel to the person next to me even if I don't know him/her. It was frustrating not being able to talk properly to my husband on the flights. Another disadvantage of the configuration is that you can't comfortably lie down across both seats if the plane is empty (as it was on the way home from LA to Auckland-we would actually have been better in economy as everyone back there got a row each and could lie down properly! But of course you can't predict that). The food on the longer legs is nice but it seems very odd that they bring out the desserts with the starters and you have to sit and look and the dessert through your starter and main course. As the trays and tables are very small and a bit unstable this is actually a real pain. It is also difficult to get drinks served with your meal. They bring the drinks after the meals and personally I can't eat a meal without drinking something. In general the staff were pretty unhelpful. It was difficult to get a soft drink or orange juice at all times. I was also refused an inflight magazine when I asked. I was told they weren't produced and were 'online'. The safety video (Lord of the Rings-style) was incredibly annoying. So - lots of space but a not very good seat. Nice food but wobbly trays. Snarly staff in the main. Avoid the front row in premium economy as the configuration is even worse than the other rows.

### Air New Zealand customer review
After waking at 4am to check in at Sydney International at 5.15am for a 7.15am departure on 25 March 2015 I was given a boarding pass for flight NZ700 which said to go to Gate G53 so after completing the usual checks I set off for the long long walk to Gate 53. When almost there I glanced at a screen showing departures and saw that Gate 27 was now showing for my flight. I stopped an airport employee showed him my boarding pass and the screen and asked if he could find out where I should be. After a phone call he said I should retrace my steps and go to Gate 29 which I did. Once there an official announced that our departure time was now 9.15am instead of 7.15am and they would give us a voucher to get some refreshments. I returned to Gate 29. We boarded our flight at approximately 9.50am and departed at about 10.10am. All I was offered on that flight was tea coffee or water. The arrival time in Auckland had been 12.15pm and we arrived at about 4.00pm. The other complaint I have is that the hand control for the screen at my seat showed ERR and did not respond to any selection. I signalled to a young male steward I needed help and after showing him the problem no attempt was made to reset it and the attitude was extremely offhand. My impression of the whole affair is that Air New Zealand doesn't care about their customers. Having to pay to watch a movie really Air New Zealand when I think of what lovely service we used to get it makes me very disappointed.

Flight NZ 282 AKL-SGP. We had booked flight with Singapore Airlines but new arrangement with Air NZ caused transfer to Air NZ. Although the plane and food was good the comparison to Singapore Airlines certainly did not favour ANZ. On SGP Airlines the attendants give you warm towel before takeoff and keep circulating in the cabin with drinks and eats. On ANZ we only saw attendants when meals were served and needed to ring for them when we wanted anything else. No duty free offered on ANZ and bathrooms were devoid of any extras like mouthwash and hand moisturiser etc etc. ANZ very pleasant but cannot compare to SGP Airlines.

### Air New Zealand customer review
NZ 281 25 Mar and NZ 282 on 2 Apr. Took the Premium Economy class flight to and from Auckland and I loved it. The seats are spacious and comfortable and it definitely felt much better than a red-eye flight on Economy. The complimentary bottle of water is a great touch because you do tend to get very dehydrated on a flight and having the bottle meant you didn't have to ask for a glass of water from the attendants every 10 minutes or so. The pillow provided is big and soft and very comfortable whether to hug or to prop against your back. The USB and power outlet though not uncommon anymore are still very much appreciated. I'm not sure if this feature exists in other airlines or if it's even a plausible concept but it may be great if a passenger can play his/her own media via a USB device eg. movies on a thumb drive or the sort. On the flight to Auckland there were just a handful of people in the Premium Economy cabin so service was impeccable and thoughtful right from the start. The attendants even came around mid-flight to make sure everything was okay for me. On my return it was a fully- booked flight so the attendants really had their work cut out for them. But they were still thoughtful and reasonably efficient. I would definitely fly with Air NZ again if I get the chance. Oh and did I mention that their safety video is really "epic"? It's the only safety video which I personally have ever given 110% attention to.

NPE-AKL-CHC on ATR72 and A320. We should have travelled via Wellington to Christchurch we had checked in early having returned a rental car and were having a coffee when we were asked to go to check in desk the agent said weather was bad in Wellington and flights are being delayed did we wish to go via AKL arriving in CHC 2 hours earlier than planned we took up his offer. This was excellent unrequested customer service. Drink and snack on these short legs.

Gisborne-Christchurch NZ8652 and NZ0525. Wonderful experience travelling with two pre-school age children from Gisborne to Auckland and then on to Christchurch. The whole way was a pleasure with the pilots making our kids day by waving to them from the cockpit and the air hostess that let my daughter handout the sweets. I will point out the plane was running slightly late so it would have been understandable for them to be feeling slightly rushed and not accommodating but staff went above and beyond in all aspects.

HKG-AKL in Economy. My daughter recently took this trip as part of a school trip. The flight was very average however her comment to me made me laugh. She pressed the call button to ask for some water it was delivered but was told not to use it again but actually come and get the water herself. She asked what is the call button for then to wake to wake you up. The stewards do not see the funny side of her comment.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flew from Honolulu to Auckland. Paid a small fee for a preferred bulkhead seat. It was one of the most uncomfortable seats I have flown. No space to extend my legs (I flew bulkhead many times before but the seat has never been so close to the wall) and since they installed the control for the entertainment system inside the arm rest it was also extremely narrow. I am 6"2 and athletic. I can't imagine what this seat would be like for an overweight. When I complained to the flight attendant she said 'at least nobody is going to recline their seat'. I was aware of that and I believe that was the whole point of paying extra. Additional issues: the plane looked so old it was sad only one suitcase to check in even on an international flight food was less than mediocre. I would definitely fly Hawaiian airlines on my next trip. On top of all this I did not get any mileage credit on united on my return flight. I did get it on the way there so it was not the type of ticket.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Travelled from London to Auckland. Having lived in London for the last 11 years I was on a flight moving back to New Zealand permanently. Flew with Singapore Airlines on SQ317 from London to Singapore and had excellent service the whole way. The flight attendants were friendly food was served quickly and was delicious trays were removed quickly and we were constantly provided refreshments. At the beginning of the flight my sister was having problems with her entertainment console so the attendant offered to re-boot the system. it was done immediately and they checked after a couple of minutes that it was working. It happened a couple of times during the flights so the attendant gave her a voucher to use towards a duty free item which was a very kind gesture. However our onwards flight from Singapore to Auckland was extremely disappointing and one of the worst long haul flights I have been on. Most of the flight attendants were very friendly (I did hear one tell a traveller that they couldn't fix their console as they were about to serve food which seemed very unhelpful) however their service was extremely lacking. Shortly after taking off we discovered that our entertainment consoles were not working properly but either continually freezing or losing sound. We pressed the buzzer for a flight attendant but after waiting 10 mins and watching them walk past us a couple of times we had to ask them in person for assistance. Rather than offer to re-boot the consoles as Singapore Airlines had done we were informed that they had been aware of the problem in Singapore but were unable to fix it until they got to Auckland. For a passenger on a 9 hour flight who has already travelled on a 12 hour flight just beforehand this was very disappointing news. We were both transferred to other seats (seated separately) however the cabin was so cold further forward that I ended up returning to my original seat. The service and quality of the food was also very disappointing. The chicken dinner we were served was very salty and the breakfast omelette was rubbery. The chicken sausage accompanying it was inedible. The attendants were also extremely slow with clearing the trays in comparison to Singapore Airlines. My sister is has Gold airpoints status so we had priority labels on our luggage however we were one of the last to get our luggage upon arrival in Auckland. Overall it was an extremely disappointing and frustrating flight. Like others who have placed reviews recently I will be very hesitant to fly Air New Zealand internationally in the future.

I flew from Auckland to Brisbane and back Feb 13-18 2015. The first flight was uneventful. The 2nd flight or return was awful. I think Air NZ has gone downhill. My tray table was direct and had juice marks or sticky stuff on it. There was dirt below the armrest. The row in front of me had chewing gum on the seats. My inflight entertainment did not work at all for the entire flight despite being reset twice. There was no ice on board and ran out apparently - sometime I do not believe that. Overall a lousy airline.

### Air New Zealand customer review
AKL-LAX as part of a longer journey to Europe. First time in Economy on the 777-300. Cramming an extra seat in each row was a huge mistake: I was in the aisle seat and everyone including crew kept whomping me. If I wasn't using sleeping tablets to knock me out there is no way I could've slept in that seat. Meals were good and the crew were as well. As soon as NZ has competition on flights to the West coast they will bleed business. And I'm Airports Gold.

We arrived at Wellington airport on 1st March 2015 for our return flight at about 1pm for flight NZ849 due to depart at 3.45 pm with a check-in time of 2.15 pm. We had booked and paid for this flight on 14th August 2014. Normal check-in procedures did not work and we were advised that the flight had a weight problem and we should check back at 2.30. We advised that we would miss a medical appointment made 4 months previously if we did not catch the flight. When we checked back we were advised that we could not go as the plane had a weight issue. Our luggage was not weighed at any time prior to this and was about half of the allowed weight. If the issue really was one of weight then Air New Zealand is obviously incapable of flying with the baggage allowances that it has set and if passengers with half that allowance are denied access to a flight booked over 6 months previously then they should look at a fairer way of deciding exactly who they will allow on planes. It would seem that this was just an excuse and I strongly suspect that the real issue was that Air New Zealand had over-booked the flight and the issue was one of seating on the plane. If this is indeed the case then it would have been better to have been told this from the outset instead of being jerked around by being told to return at 2.30 pm. Air New Zealand did arrange for alternative travel the next day and they did arrange for overnight accommodation with meals (but no drinks at all including non-alcoholic drinks and the meal allowance for dinner was only sufficient for the main course without either entree or dessert). They also provided both of us with $300 travel vouchers with them but we feel that being lied to and treated in a shoddy manner once by a company is unfortunate: to give that company the opportunity of doing it again is stupidity.

Flew Auckland to Heathrow on 23/02/2015 in PE in Space Seats these are great seats you are in your own space no one can recline into your space. Entertainment very good and staff between Auckland and LA were brilliant they could not do enough for you and were always making sure you had everything you needed I wish I could say the same for those between LA and Heathrow who were absent from the cabin for a large amount of the time and did not have any real interface with the passengers. I ordered a coffee in the early hours and this was delivered promptly but I still had the cup over 2 hours later as the staff were absent from the cabin not very good service. Those staff on the Heathrow leg could learn a lot from those on the Auckland leg.

### Air New Zealand customer review
2 weeks ago my husband and I went to New Zealand. For years we travelled with Air Canada or Air New Zealand and this last time we made a big mistake and decided to fly with United. We prolonged our arrival to Auckland by a few good hours but we would co-op with these extra hours had it not be for the awful time on the flight to and from Auckland. The disrespect and disregard to it's passengers is shameful. There is no room for peoples' legs. This is a very long flight and airlines need to consider peoples' health as well. The food was awful. Cold and not edible. The flight attendants were beyond rude. I was shocked when 2 of them who could not decide if the liquid in the pots are tea or coffee simply removed the lids and put their noses in. People stared in disbelief. However when we got to Sydney Australia we embarked on an Air New Zealand flight to Auckland. What a huge difference. All of the sudden we could stretch our legs. The food was edible and the flying attendants were courteous. Going back home to Canada the experience repeated itself. We flew Air New Zealand to Sydney and everything was good and then hell repeated itself when we had to embark Untied from Sydney to Canada. My husband and I decided that never again will we fly United. Our son who was wiser flew Air New Zealand and he mocked us for choosing United. They are bad news to the rest of the carriers on star alliance. Life is a school and we learned our lesson the hard way.

### Air New Zealand customer review
I flew from Tokyo Narita to Auckland (767-300) then Wellington to Auckland (A320) and finally Auckland back to Tokyo (787-900). Both international flights were just average. Little things like lack of in-flight magazine plastic cutlery minimal updates from the flight deck and lack of menu bugged me. The service on the old and tired 767 was significantly lower than that on the 787. The touch screen on the 767 was not very responsive at all. I was very impressed with the in-seat bar service on the 787. At the touch of a button you could order a drink or snack from the comfort of your seat and it would be served to you within minutes. The international check in at Auckland Airport was a complete shambles with queues everywhere and a lack of order. I also don't understand why you can't check in online if you booked through a 3rd party travel agent. All other airlines allow this why not Air New Zealand? The domestic flight was excellent. For just a short 45 min flight we were treated very well with excellent service (cheese and biscuits wine and soft drinks). The pilots also kept us fully informed on the progress of the flight. All in all Air New Zealand is fine but the international service needs improving. I guess I was just expecting something more from the so called Kiwi hospitality.

Flew from Queenstown NZ to MEL on NZ837 in economy. Hadn't flown on Air NZ for 10 years and we were keen to see if all the hype around their new "experience" was justified so we paid extra and got "the works". We departed on time and arrived 20 minutes early. The amount of legroom in the A320 was a positive revelation as was the extent and content of offerings provided on the in-flight entertainment system. The meal was fine without being exceptional and the crew was terrific. It really was a pleasure to fly. Thumbs up to Air NZ based on this flight!

Myself and my daughter received a one up upgrade to Business from Premium Economy San Francisco to Auckland 14th February. We were delighted about this however we soon wished we had stayed in Premium Economy as the cabin crew were extremely unfriendly and gave the impression that it was beneath them to attend to us. They rushed the meal service and hardly spoke to anyone and as for a smile forget it! The only upside to the upgrade was the lie flat bed  I am pleased that we didn't pay full price for this appalling service. Next time we will be staying in Premium Economy which was excellent.

### Air New Zealand customer review
We travelled Brisbane to Auckland on 10th of February and were surprisingly upgraded to business class as the flight was overbooked. Our choice was to fly with a free bag each and we were initially given the very worst seats on the aircraft the two right at the back by the toilets. Only Air New Zealand charges $30 to choose a seat so the upgrade was appreciated. However during the meal I was told my choice was no available and that as an upgrade I did not count. I was offered the choice of two other meals but did not want either of them and settled for another starter. Flying this airline is not what it was it used to be a great experience now the on board staff don't really care what happens. This was once a pleasure to fly but now it is a relief to get off the plane and really nowadays we only fly with them for the points and they are very careful to book you on a non points earning ticket. Small wonder they are making a profit.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flying an old worn out 767 from Auckland to Honolulu and back. Yes the pilot got us where the ticket said we were going I'll them credit but felt crammed like sardines the entire time. Cant comment on the food as we had seat only plus bag though if you want to go for 8 hours without food or movies good luck getting sleep in these seats. Also should you choose no food or movies you get treated a bit like a second class citizen by some of the staff members. Ground staff lounge staff were good.

I travelled Works De-luxe Gold Coast to Auckland on 14/02/15 and returned on flight NZ937 on 21/02/15. I have done this trip on many occasions and have never been disappointed. Air New Zealand crew are so friendly and make you feel welcome. Due to ex tropical cyclone Marcia the return flight was diverted to Brisbane and we were then bussed to the Gold Coast airport. This was done efficiently and without fuss. I like the A320 for these short flights across the ditch. I only ever sit in seat 1A and have no complaints to make whatsoever.

### Air New Zealand customer review
I flew SYD to AKL on a 777-200U after flying from Saigon and it was a real pleasure to fly. The cabin was new and very comfortable. The IFE was great with a very responsive touch screen that was more like a tablet than the usual unresponsive screens. The seat was very good with plenty of space - I am a large man and usually my knees touch the back of the seat but not on this plane. I didn't try the food as I was not feeling that well but the crew have a relaxed but competent manner.

### Air New Zealand customer review
My wife and I chose to travel to Vancouver Premium Economy expecting it to be far better than regular Economy. Apart from the extra leg room we were disappointed. The seats were not very comfortable we did not have separate arm rests which was a big problem when a large person spilled over one for the entire return journey. The in- flight entertainment TV was old and malfunctioning to the extent that we gave up trying to watch certain movies. The food and service was good for us but not good for some who had no food choice when certain meals ran out. The staff were on the whole pleasant and helpful and apologetic about the seating and entertainment equipment. Overall we rated the experience a hardly worth the extra cost and would rate it as 5 out of 10. Disappointing for us as we have always previously enjoyed travelling with Air New Zealand.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Re-routed after initial flight cancelled. Alternative flight arrangements were horrendous. What should have been a 26 hour trip between UK and NZ turned into 45 hours. During that 45 hours not a single member of Air NZ staff came and explained what was going on. No gluten free meals had been arranged for my husband who has Coeliac Disease and the final straw was being routed via Brisbane and practically abandoned! No onward booking had been made for us. We have flown regularly between UK and Australia and NZ for the last 15 years and this was the worst customer service we have ever come across!

### Air New Zealand customer review
We flew Brisbane to Vancouver via Auckland (NZ 136/84 outbound) and return (NZ 83/135 inbound) We chose Air NZ based on recommendations and rating - boy were we disappointed. The aircraft (with the exception of NZ 135 seriously needs refurbishing the seats were hard and very cramped for long haul travel the IFE was terrible  the picture quality was poor to say the least and because there are no inflight magazines it took some time and patience to navigate. As experienced travellers one could only say that the food was as bad as it gets and if you want water after meal service you have to go look for someone to serve you. It would be nice if Air NZ would get into the current technology century and provide USB chargers in every seat not just in Business Class as were informed mid fight. Don't fall for the trap of paying extra for preferred seating unless you can fluke an exit row or bulkhead seat this is just a money grabber for the airline.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Have travelled many times on Air New Zealand around the world and my partner is a member of the Koru Club. On a flight NZ134 on 6th February I was made to feel very much a second class citizen because we had chosen the lesser option of no food/movies etc. A choice we made because we prefer not to eat food on flight. The attendant was coming around collecting everyone's dinner remains when 'she' reached rudely across to grab my water glass in its container. I said ' oh I would like another glass of water please'. She took the glass said there had been a medical emergency on board which I was aware of and that they were to busy. That was okay until the next lady in the row directly in front of me turned and asked for another glass of wine and was served immediately. That was just so rude of the flight attendant. I was fuming and when another attendant came by later it didn't seem to be so difficult to get it. I wanted to express my anger but did realize that the emergency did probably upset the normal routines.

### Air New Zealand customer review
I have just travelled from London to Auckland. The first leg with Singapore Airlines and the second sector with Air New Zealand. I have travelled a lot in the last 10 years and had not been on Air New Zealand for about 5 years. What has happened? After Singapore Airlines it was like travelling on a budget airline. No inflight information at all no screen as it was broken awful food. Apart from one staff member it seemed too much trouble to do anything for anyone. I had a young mother next to me travelling with 2 young children the staff did not come near and the children's meal that arrived was turned down by a hungry and disappointed 4 year old. For our meal wine food and coffee was all served together in a rush to get it over it seemed. If I can help it I will never fly with them again. There was much talk as luggage was picked up by many passengers who were shocked at the very expensive flight they had just taken and the standard of service. I felt embarrassed by our National Airline.

### Air New Zealand customer review
777-200 Auckland to Vancouver suppose the easiest thing to say I will never fly long haul with NZ Airways again. IFE that was ancient and didn't work properly. I really don't enjoy having the passengers seat so close to my face when they recline. Not an enjoyable trip. Please update your cabins. Passengers pay good money and shouldn't be treated like this especially when there are plenty of options for getting to YVR.

Guys get into the 21st century and please please upgrade your planes on the Auckland/Hawaii route. I would have been more comfortable in a tiger moth. We fly business on medium to long hauls for the comfort and additional extras which by the way we also pay for. The seats in business class remind me of a Jason recliner but less accommodating. No real issues with service but the food does leave a bit to be desired. I do a lot of flying and although I am a parochial NZer give me Emirates anytime.

### Air New Zealand customer review
I've flown long haul with Virgin and their Premium Economy product is excellent but Air New Zealand's just takes it that one notch above (although it does cost slightly more too). Firstly the seat - it's in a shell so the seat tilts and slides rather than reclines into the space behind you. You're also angled slightly and so if you're in the outer seats you're not obliged to talk to the person next to you - it's your own personal space. I paid the extra for seats at the front of the cabin and they're well worth the upgrade - so much legroom and easy to get in and out (useful if travelling solo). The centre seats are better for couples as you can share the space. Check their website for information. The food was excellent served on crockery with metal cutlery. You'll get your starter etc first and wait some time for the hot meal meanwhile your dessert is also sat in front of you being very tempting! The hot food was good although the menu options were a little unusual - both times I went for the fish as the other options (beef and chicken) contained various things I didn't care for. The service was impeccable - the staff were very friendly except one attendant who seemed a little off although still professional. Inflight entertainment is on a decent sized touch screen although there is also a remote in the side of the seat. The selection was surprising - there were a large number of retro movies rather than all the latest blockbusters (of which there were few). However this was actually quite nice as I watched a few older favourites rather than having to gamble on new choices. My favourite thing about the IFE was being able to order drinks and snacks from the screen. Just tap an option or two and it's delivered to your seat a few minutes later whilst you continue to watch your movie. All seats have USB sockets for charging and I think you can link them up to a USB drive but I didn't test this. Also charging sockets are available for your laptop. You can use a standard UK plug as well as US and some other options. The toilets! Firstly two toilets dedicated to Premium Economy - so no queuing. And they were the best - fancy wallpaper with funny fake bookshelves on it (read some of the titles) and music piped in too. Frankly I would pay the upgrade just for those! Finally when flying to the USA you are right near the front of the plane so you're off quickly and can hot foot it to immigration to hopefully beat the queues. Unless you have ridiculously high standards of what you expect from a metal tube flying through the air I don't think you'll be disappointed.

### Air New Zealand customer review
SFO-AKL 777-300 Economy. Got a decent deal on an airfare but was a bit worried about the reports of the 3-4-3 configuration in Air New Zealand economy. It is very tight and this is magnified on a long flight. For me no amount of service compensated for the feeling of being jammed in like sheep. Clearly the bottom line is the only thing that matters. What was once one of the best economy classes in the sky has literally devolved into sardine class. In the future I would take longer routing to avoid Air New Zealand.

### Air New Zealand customer review
SYD-AKL. I was booked in business class on a late afternoon flight. I was informed by the airline that there had been a change and the flight no longer offered business class. Instead I was offered something called World Deluxe Service which is ridiculous and expensive for what it is. Basically it is a fully economy A320 aircraft where the first two rows only use two of the three seats. Essentially someone sits in 1A and 1C but they don't sell 1B. You also get lounge access and the onboard economy meal. I actually had to argue with the booking agent that I was entitled to money back. I had to explain that I had purchased a business class ticket (for myself wife and son) and now that they no longer provided me with business class they actually owed me money. Eventually they relented. The aircraft was absolutely disgusting. It was ancient (or looked ancient). My family was in 1A 1C and 1D (no one was in 1F or in row two at all). There was no divider wall in front of row one so I had to privilege of basically sitting in the galley for three hours watching the flight attendants work. My son was seated in 1C but I had to move him because "he was too young for an exit row". Since when is row one an exit row? We were sitting opposite two flight attendants. Wouldn't they operate the door in an emergency? Where they expecting my 9 year old to do it? Air New Zealand's seat selection system is the worst. It is time for the IT department to let you pick specific seats for each passenger instead of picking a block of seats for you. The seats on this aircraft had perhaps a millimetre of recline. It was one of the most uncomfortable flights I have never been on. The entertainment system worked poorly and my son's did not work at all. The only positive is that the Air New Zealand staff are perhaps the nicest people anywhere. I have never had anything but truly outstanding service from the cabin crew on all of my flights with them over the years and this flight was no exception.

### Air New Zealand customer review
On a 3-hour flight with the flight tracking indicating that we were still 43 minutes out of Sydney the cabin crew issued the tray tables up and seats to upright order with the reason given that we were soon to start our descent into Sydney. This was 25 minutes before the captain issued the "Cabin Crew prepare the cabin for landing" instruction. The Air New Zealand aircraft seats are particularly uncomfortable in upright position. On later politely querying why the cabin crew had pre-empted the captain by 25 minutes I was rebuked with the retort that it was a "courtesy decision". The only people provided a courtesy by the action were the cabin attendants themselves so they could relax during the rest of the flight.

Travelled LHR/LA 25/12/14. Staff service fair food (veg option) very poor entertainment tired especially movies on offer. London catering needs attention. Big contrast with inward journey 15.1.15 where staff were very good veg option (ex LA) tasty with lots of fresh veg and fruit inflight entertainment also good.

Flight 002 LAX-LHR. Jan 4 2015. Not much of a value if you can't get customer service. A satisfactory trip is so much more than seat comfort or food quality. In-air staff is lovely. Once you get off the plane the trouble begins.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flown Air NZ on the MEL-AKL-VAN and return 3 times over the last 2 years and have enjoyed the experience very much flown on both B777-200ER and B777-300 in economy and felt comfortable despite being 6ft 2in. Meals are excellent and so is the service as well as a wide variety of drinks and snacks available throughout the whole flight. Vast entertainment selection with something for everybody. My seat on my recent flight from Auckland to Vancouver had a faulty remote for the entertainment screen and the flight attendant was very helpful in trying to fix the issue whilst we were heading to the runway but couldn't so he said wait till we take off and I could move to another seat that has a working remote and this was the only seat left in economy which had only improved my view on Air NZ.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flew Air New Zealand in economy from LHR to LAX on their 777-300. Overall it was a good flight - cabin ambience with the mood lighting and black seats was great seat comfort was also good inflight AVOD good food good and friendly flight attendants that came by every 30 minutes or so with water. I would recommend Air New Zealand. The only thing I didn't like was 10 abreast in economy which meant that it was difficult to walk down the aisles without weaving through people's elbows and legs.

### Air New Zealand customer review
AKL-CHC 19 Dec A320. Self service check in bag drop security boarding all uneventful. Seat comfortable enough and FAs smiling friendly seemingly enjoying themselves. We were offered tea coffee or water and choice of a (yes one) biscuit or a little bag of cassava chippies. I don't mind if Air NZ wants to be cheap or save money but I'd like the option to get something a bit better than that even if I have to pay. Some years ago I regularly flew with Air NZ WLG-AKL and they used to provide a full cooked breakfast and substantial snacks during the rest of the day . Disappointed with the change. Toilet was spotless but nothing else was. Bulkheads arm rest seat back seat all filthy. Noting has been dusted for an age let alone wiped down. Gross. We hit turbulence en route and gratefully the pilot managed to drop us down below it. Baggage misdirected at CHC so took almost an hour to retrieve it. Ground staff were aware of this but surprisingly didn't bother to tell anyone we had to go find them. Little competition appears to not have done anyone any favours and so will have to fly them again. Oh well. Word of caution...Always use the NZ website to book flights. When Iwent to book my multi drop NZ itinerary on their UK website only the full fat (most expensive) fare was offered. I switched to the NZ site and saved several hundred dollars.

### Air New Zealand customer review
NZ 879 CHC-OOL A320. Paid for "works". Awful (dry) food which lack any imagination water served in plastic cups no inflight magazine no sick bags no head phones so had to wait for them to arrive before I could use the entertainment system. The entertainment system had very limited selection of movies scrolling between screens was slow to navigate and the whole thing seemed counter-intuitive. When on Emirates you get an entertainment guide/magazine which allows you to view the selection of movies at a glance with Air NZ you need to slowly scroll through each page of movies. Hostesses rather than being professional were trying to be too friendly/familiar - the "kiwi" way does not automatically equate to being professional. Really poor work Air NZ regret using you.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Air New Zealand may well win awards for international services but the customer care when dealing with people when flights are cancelled on domestic routes leaves a lot to be desired. Our flight to New Plymouth was unable to land due to low cloud and we returned to Auckland we were told there would no more flights that day and we were rebooked on an early morning flight there was no offer of accommodation or alternative ground transport despite a lot requests for a coach to be laid on we were left at 7pm in Auckland airport with nowhere to stay no offer of any assistance whatsoever. This is the problem when you have a monopoly on regional air services take it or leave it.

Flew HKG-AKL-CHC then AKL-YVR with Air NZ as part of a round-the-world itinerary. Their service is second-to-none even in economy. One of the flights was on a refitted B777-200ER and although narrower the new-style seat was very comfortable and I slept well in it.

### Air New Zealand customer review
4th Nov NZ 175. We flew from Auckland to Perth in the excellent new Dreamliner - what a plane! The seats were the best business class seats we have had the pleasure of traveling in so far. The entertainment system was superb and very easy to use. The food was 5 star restaurant quality and as usual great friendly staff. We were amazed to how great we felt after a 7 hour flight and the hostess said that is because of the cabin pressure in the new Dreamliners we have had no jet lag and slipped into Perth time straight away. Can't wait for our return flight home!

### Air New Zealand customer review
NZ734 BNE-AKL 5 Nov 14. Seat only flight good on time good crew IFE fine but no laptop power and buy on board food is poor. I usually fly QF but their plane was full and this was the best bet but it wasn't cheap. While unbundling is sensible the inability to get a decent meal is not. The only way to get a meal is to buy the Works which is not economic for a hand luggage only or day trip passenger. Air NZ is not an LCC so shouldn't act like one. It can do better.

### Air New Zealand customer review
12/10 NZ135 AKL-BNE. A disappointing Business Class experience. Whilst the cabin and seats were nice the staff attitude was poor - surly and pretentious attitude that revolves around them rather than the passenger. Distasteful bragging about wining various airline awards - but with little evidence of such justification. Offered champagne at 09.30 in the morning was inappropriate followed by food that was inedible. All in all poor value for money in comparison to other airlines that offer a far superior attentive service.

### Air New Zealand customer review
I flew LHR-LAX and LAX-LHR with my daughter in rows 36H an 36J (preferred seating). I booked Air New Zealand as a result of the good price I got (£518 return) but the experience was such that I would definitely use them on this route instead of Virgin or BA. The food and wine selection was better than most airline food I have eaten except perhaps Turkish Airlines. The aircraft on the outward journey was only 2 weeks old and immaculate. The returning flight was in Lord of the Rings Livery and was also a pretty new aircraft. Upon first glance the seats seem quite narrow but sometimes looks deceive and I found the seating very comfortable. I accept that I had no seat in front of me but my daughter who had a seat in front of her was pretty comfortable despite being quite tall. The only negative with the Boeing 777-300 in this layout is the very narrow aisle but it's not a deal breaker for me. However the best thing about Air New Zealand were the staff friendly helpful and professional on both legs of the flight.

### Air New Zealand customer review
MEL-WEL-CHC-MEL. One of the best economy class trips - smooth and efficient. Arrived in Wellington early. Staff really good. Surprisingly the Airbus 320 was very comfortable. No food if you are on a budget air-ticket. Highly recommended.

### Air New Zealand customer review
We booked an infant fare with Air NZ for a flight from Auckland to London and had to pay an extra $100 each leg to access a bassinet seat. The infant fare also doesn't include checked luggage which meant we had to spend another $155 each leg for 23kgs of luggage. Compare this to Qantas where both the 'extras' of the bassinet seat and 23kgs luggage were included as part of the fare. Overall we had to spend $255 extra on each leg for an infant to travel on top of a relatively high base fare. When I discussed this with AirNZ customer service they indicated the cabin luggage limit of 7kgs should be perfectly fine for travelling long haul with an infant obviously never travelled with a child. Very disappointed with Air NZ's approach to infant travel as well as the response of the customer service representative.

### Air New Zealand customer review
We flew twice with Air NZ this month once from Vancouver to Auckland and once from Auckland to Hong Kong. On each occasion we were really impressed by the service. The food was great (more than I could eat on on occasion) the sensitivity to those wanting to sleep and those wanting to be provided food and or drink was terrific and the smiles seemed to be genuine (even at the end of a long haul flight - some achievement). We flew Economy Class Air NZ in 2008 and had the same superb service. It's not what you pay it's who you fly with and Air NZ is in the very top shelf.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Air New Zealand - NZ5 LAX to AKL. Poor customer service poor communications. Poor seating. What more can I say but poor. What is the point of preferred seating with airlines if they then change the aircraft type and do not move the allocated passenger seating around. I am well over 6 foot with a minor back injury and had booked an exit seat over 9 months in advance so that I could have a bit of comfort. It appears that the aircraft type was changed out of LAX but this was not passed on to the passengers so when we boarded I found my 'exit' seat was now stuck in the middle of the aircraft. Even with the seat in front of me fully raised I could not sit with my legs straight in front rather splayed either side. When the seat was reclined I had no space at all and the insides of my knees were constantly rubbing against the seat in front and it meant that my knees were encroaching on the passenger next to me. Also the media screen is then just inches from you and is pretty useless to view. Have never had this issue with Singapore or Emirates and as the national carrier and not a budget airline I would expect better from them.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flew from Sydney to Auckland in Economy Class which was perfectly satisfactory. We then flew on from Auckland to San Francisco using Premium Economy Class which we thought was excellent. The new style seats were very spacious and well laid out (perhaps the seat could have slid forward a bit more?). Good service; good food and a superb range of movies and TV channels etc. made for a comfortable relaxing flight and other airlines could do worse than copy this benchmark. I would recommend this service.

### Air New Zealand customer review
NZ 7 San Francisco to Auckland 30th September 2014. Traveled on a leg of a round trip holiday to US from Australia. Pre-flight announcement advised potential problems with the entertainment system on the 777-200 and not fixed by the time we took off. After a number of attempts to reset at the start of the flight the crew gave up and I endured 13+ hours with nothing to distract while jammed in one of the worst economy class seats (47F). A very unpleasant flight. Even in the 70s you got an inflight movie! Food was much worse than other Air New Zealand legs flown. Staff were good and full of apologies but this does not excuse poor maintenance.

### Air New Zealand customer review
LHR-AKL via LAX and return; premium economy. It's obvious that a lot of thought has gone into the design of the premium economy seats. There is a lot to like particularly the legroom the extra bits of storage space and general layout of the seats. Where they fail is with the reclining system. It allows you to incline your lower body but what's needed to place people for sleep is a facility to lower your head. In that respect the traditional tilt-back seats were vastly better despite the problems they can cause for other passengers who don't want to sleep. By airline standards food and drink were excellent on all four legs. Service too was great but why can't drinks as well as small pieces of food be left out for pickup between meal services? The entertainment system was OK but lacking in recent blockbuster movies. I was glad I paid the extra for premium economy but found it very hard to sleep in these upright pod seats.

### Air New Zealand customer review
LHR-LAX and return in Sept. Excellent flight on fairly new B777-300 out leg very good in Premium Economy. Cabin crew outstanding both legs food excellent. Both flights ahead of schedule. Only small negative comment would be onboard entertainment particularly the movies none of which I would describe as mainstream. Nevertheless would not hesitate to recommend ANZ. Well done to them!

We flew Business Class from Auckland to Hong Kong and was a wonderful experience. I have recently flown long-haul Business on Cathay and Emirates and the Air NZ lie-flat bed is far better then anything else I have seen. Food was great.

### Air New Zealand customer review
HK to AKL Business Class 15 Sept 2014. New updated 777-200 for one of its first flights on the route. Generally a smooth ANZ service with the staff obviously enjoying the new updated plane. The seats etc were very much like the 777-300ER with updated touch screen movies much improved than the old toggle system. Great updated menu from Peter Gordon more interesting meals. Delay due to weather that held us on the tarmac before departure but they were flexible and let people up are around to the bathrooms despite having left the gate. Hard to fault a new internal refreshed interior and great staff.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Code share Virgin Australia. Flight number VA7405. AKL airport and several Air NZ staff were unable to tell me where to check in despite it being an Air NZ flight. Screen confirmed check in at Gate A where I had been asking. Told to check in at kiosk but would only accept Air NZ flight number and my e-ticket only had VA flight number. Told by successive staff I must have been given Air NZ flight number unwilling to help. Shoved e-ticket under the nose of the staff member who insisted I should know and said showed me where it states Air NZ flight number. He said it was NZ105. He could have said that 10 mins earlier. By the time I checked in the flight was boarding and I still had to get to the departure gate through customs and to the boarding gate. Just made the plane and was told by Air NZ staff I should have checked in and moved to gate earlier. 1 hr 15 min to check in. Unacceptable. Onboard having travelled 5 hours to the airport and the check in debacle I looked forward to a meal and movie. Told no meal no movie. Uncomfortable seat that barely reclined. I fly Emirates and am used to a meal tea coffee wine and the ICE entertainment system. One FA gave me movie access out of pity and I had to pay $10 for a sandwich. Emirates please fly to Denpasar Bali so I never have to go through this again. Our national carrier is a disorganised disgrace.

Got upgraded to business class on the Auckland-Apia (Samoa) flight. Although these seats are the old style recliner type they were comfortable enough for the 4 hour flight. Cabin staff were excellent. Had the bacon roll for breakfast great taste. Flew back a week later in economy on an Airbus. As always flying Air NZ is a great experience.

AKL to SFO 777 300ER. Great flight with a very friendly and efficient cabin crew. Food was extremely good and nicely presented. Aircraft was fairly new clean with comfortable flat beds. A very enjoyable flight. This was a vastly better experience than our next leg with British Airways.

### Air New Zealand customer review
YVR to AKL 777-200ER. Another excellent flight with Air New Zealand. The cabin crew were great and made the flight very enjoyable. Food was great and nicely presented. The aircraft was fairly old but was clean and everything worked as it should. The entertainment system could do with an upgrade to content performance and display quality. The Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounge at Vancouver that Air New Zealand uses is quite poor.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Over the past few months I have done long haul return flights in Premium Economy on Qantas Cathay and British Airways and Business Class on Singapore Airlines. I was flying from Sydney to San Francisco (via Auckland and LA) and the flight segment yesterday in Air New Zealand Premium Economy (space seats) from Auckland to Los Angeles was vastly better than all the other airline's Premium Economy. The seats are wonderfully designed spacious and comfortable with ample surrounding space. I loved the large pillow and even got a second one for extra comfort. In fact (even though the seats don't lie flat) the whole premium economy cabin with mood lighting and great layout looked better than the business class cabin. The toilet area was huge always spotless and I loved the whimsical 'bookcase'! The amenity pack was welcome with Clarins creams and cute stripy socks and eye mask with funny message on it. The entertainment selection (with noise cancelling headphones) was huge - really something for everyone - and a big screen with multiple angles for comfortable viewing. The service from 2 male flight attendants was outstanding and the meals were absolutely delicious by any (not just airline) standard. I think the food is the same as in Business Class - for dinner I had figs olives and proscuiito as a starter salmon in a crust with bean puree and spinach lemon tart camomile tea and chocolates (with sparkling wine and NZ Shiraz) breakfast was muesli with yoghurt cheese and mushroom omelette with tomato concasse coffee etc. I have often flown business and first class on other airlines - I can honestly say that if I could fly to all the destination I need to go on Air NZ Premium Economy (space seats) it would always be my first choice. A superb product.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flew SYD-AKL-LAX and return in August/September 2014. SYD-AKL was on the new 787 Dreamliner. Was excellent for the short trip although had to move to Economy for take off and landing due to no seat belt extension onboard. The IFE is new and much quicker to respond than the older style. It is more an app-style interface which was easier to use and less clunky. AKL-LAX was same reliable service from Air NZ. Helpful efficient mature staff with excellent food and comfortable seat/bed. Amenity pack is cheap and nasty compared with days past and no pyjamas compared with other airlines at the same or cheaper price point. Lounge in Auckland is good but always crowded lounge in Sydney is worn and needs a furniture update but still perfectly fine to kill the hours before your flight. Lounge staff in LAX are not up to the usual Air NZ standard but the drink selection is good the air- conditioning is cold and the food selection though limited is enough to satisfy for a snack. The showers were not up to the standard of lounges such as Virgin Atlantic and even Swiss International but ok to freshen up before the flight. The 777-300 packs a lot of people into Business class and the staff do seem to take longer than previously. The 767 seats in business are absolutely abysmal and even with the best will in the world I find it impossible to say anything good about them. Overall Air NZ is a very good airline with good staff great food and innovative product. The sooner they lose their 767 business seat the better though. Also if you're planning onward travel in USA do it yourself. There are so many better options available than the alliance offered by Air NZ with United.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Beware! This airline can change seats on you suddenly and you find out at the airport. I had a confirmed seat on a long-haul flight (AKL-HKG) and the seat that was allocated to me on my booking was given to someone else. No explanation just a bunch of lies. This could be a real problem if you are travelling with your family and all of a sudden can find out that you are all over the place. Also I tried to check in online but this airline does not allow you to do so if your ticket was issued by a travel agent (which business tickets often are). Apparently you have to purchase directly through them online in order to use the online check-in service. Had a long argument with their web support guy who couldn't seem to understand why this is so rotten. He just defended what they do This is a beautiful country with great people. They need to do something about their national airline though!

30-31st August. I was meant to have flown with Air New Zealand from Los Angeles to Heathrow but they ran out of seats and over booked the flights. So I'm now leaving a day later. I was quite upset to have been told there were not enough seats for me but the compensation came as a surprise. They offered me night over in a hotel with dinner lunch and breakfast included and to top it off cash to keep me going. So I'm very thankful for that and very impressed in the way they handled the situation. I have been guaranteed a seat on the same flight but a day later.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Auckland to Vancouver. Elderly travellers in their 80's. Premium economy in aircraft that I would guess is over 20 years old. Old square style seats with hard edges and absolutely no padding. I had a seat that was either up or fully down no adjustments. TV so much static could not watch. Seat no wider than normal economy. Footrest moved only a bit. Premium economy in my opinion not worth the extra money. As of to date we still have to go home next week Dreading this painful event. Tried to request quote to upgrade to business class. Several emails sent asking for assistance and only received generic emails with no answers. Got quote by phoning NZ $1700 per person. We can't afford it. So we will remember the final international flight - but not in a good way. I will finish by saying that Sydney to Auckland sector on the new dream liner was excellent (in economy). Recommendation is "better options out there for the money".

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flew from Auckland to Vancouver. It was a tired old plane and the movie selection was pretty tired also. Food was ok but a second cup of tea was hard to obtain. The cabin was clean. The seat was adequate. Crew members were amiable. The guy in the aisle seat had no where else to put his long legs he seemed about 6 foot six inches tall except in the aisle which was not good for anybody. It was part of a round the world fare and did not seem great value to me. Next time I will check a direct flight to LHR our final destination and side trips from there.

AKL to Apia return on NZ 992/991 for a four day trip travelling only with hand luggage. Web checked the first flight and went straight to lounge prior to boarding. Lounge busy but kept clear of passengers used dishes. Good selection of food available lounge attendants efficient as was the barista in making me a great macchiato! Flights themselves were generally excellent. Crew friendly and efficient both ways. Not much to say about return flight as leaves Apia at 0150hrs arriving 0500hrs but had a whole row to stretch out in to sleep. Early arrival home and outside terminal in 10 minutes after landing. Excellent value for money. Look forward to me next trip.

### Air New Zealand customer review
I am a Qantas Platinum but decided to try something different. Flew Air New Zealand from Melbourne - Auckland and then Auckland - Los Angeles - both legs in business class. Had issue with bags as initially they refused to transfer them from one flight to another because they were separate tickets meaning I would have only 1 hour 50 minutes to go through NZ immigration/customs and then recheck for the LA flight. I was astounded and eventually they relented agreeing to do it making it clear that it was only because I was in business class. Cabin crew on both legs were great food was excellent. Disliked the herringbone window seat arrangements as made it hard to see out of the windows. My allocated seat was not available as it had malfunctioned so they had seated me in another next to the galley which I objected to. I was then moved to another seat but the gate agent did not tell me that this too was near a galley. Not impressed! The seat on the AKL-LAX leg was comfortable but just not up to scratch. If you wanted to lie flat you had get out of the seat and then it was folded down and a mattress put on top. This means you could not sit up easily during the night as to sit up the mattress had to be removed and the seat unfolded and returned to an upright or semi-reclined position. Kind of all or nothing! Lack of storage in seat area. Would I fly Air NZ again? Only if the price was right.

PPT-AKL- MEL (NZ41-overnight flight short layover at AKL followed by NZ123) July 11-12. Both flights on B777-300. PPT airport facilities and Business Class lounge basic AKL Business Class lounge fully stocked yet overcrowded. Flight PPT-MEL: aircraft in pristine condition full flat beds mattress duvet pillow amenity kit provided. Flight attendants explained in detail use of seat controls and provided a full turn-down service to each one of the passengers shortly after take-off. Humoristic and original safety instructions video. Breakfast was served some two hours before landing - adequate quantity good quality yet nothing impressive. Lavatories clean. Cabin crew very professional. Transtasman flight AKL-MEL: This service was not at the same standard as the previous. My seat - and several others - did not function at all flight attendant had to restart them. Cabin crew more distant restrained and not at the same professional level than in the previous flight. Food and beverages average. IFE system had plenty of choices. Arrived on time. One of my suitcases was partially damaged yet ANZ in MEL arranged for its free repair. In conclusion these flights were certainly not equal in quality : the PPT-AKL was a four-to-five stars service the AKL-MEL a three-to-four stars service leaving lots to be improved.

AKL to YVR (return). On both flights the food was average and only two meals not even a snack for Lunch prior to arriving in YVR. The plane was in need of a refit. The entertainment (systems) both choice and operation was rubbish system crashed jumped and skipped so I gave up. Second major item was the Gate staff at YVR. 4 of them and two only checked in the gold/priority customers leaving the other two to check in 300+ others. All in all not impressed.

I was booked to fly on NZ103 from Auckland to Sydney having not long arrived on NZ5 from LAX. We were supposed to be flying on a 777-200 but Air NZ had changed this to a brand new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. What a bonus that turned out to be the aircraft was almost empty I had a whole three seat row to myself in the rear cabin and the new aircraft was absolutely brilliant to fly on. The seats are very much the same as the ones on the 777-300 but with a newer entertainment system and with bigger windows that tint rather than have a shade to pull down. Really enjoyed this flight look forward to flying on a Dreamliner again soon.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Air NZ uses a number of code share options in order to maximise the places that you can fly with the airline. This is fantastic option to increase the number of destinations that you can fly too. However after a recent experience I was disappointed to discover that some code share options with Air NZ have concealed conditions that are not in line with what you normally expect from an Air NZ flight. From the check in to the amount of baggage to the inflight entertainment - nothing in this case. Yes this is the Virgin Australia and Air NZ code share agreement. The Works is far from 'The Works' that you would receive on an Air NZ plane. Yes good bye unlimited drinks hello one drink. Good by movies hello you can rent one if you would like. I maybe misreading what the works means but to me that generally means everything not a limited sub-par arrangement that they currently have with Virgin. Additionally not being able to fly different classes from Wellington in very frustrating and frankly a missed opportunity for Air NZ.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flew from Auckland to Nadi in late July on an A320. Flight left on time and arrived in Nadi earlier due to a tail wind. We had a works ticket which meant we got a meal which I was very impressed with. Never knew airline food could be so good. Flight attendants as always very friendly. My only complaint is the seating of this plane. It is very squashed and the seats seemed very uncomfortable. I had difficulty eating my meal as I was in the centre seat and just really had no room for my arms. The seat was so uncomfortable that I had a slight back ache in my lower back. A terrible plane really. Would avoid a A320 in the future if I could.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flying home from Nadi to Auckland with a connecting flight to Kerikeri as we live in the Far North. On arrival at Nadi Airport we were told the plane had been upgraded from a 777 to a 747 which was the first clue to a problem as that is a much larger plane. Boarding time was 1.30pm and that came with the announcement to board so we waited at the appropriate gate and then everyone disappeared and then the announcement that there was going to be a delay. An hour delay as it turned out. Not sure why we were not told earlier about this as someone would have known but we weren't. At that time we knew we would miss our connecting flight which was the last one for that day. The steward on the plane came round to people with connecting flights to try to help us and he said that we should make it no problems and if not they could put us on a flight to Whangarei not sure how as there were none to Whangarei that day and there was no way of making that last flight as by the time you have collected your baggage (we were waiting for bags at precisely the time our connecting flight took off) and got through customs there was no chance. So we were put up for the night and booked on a flight the next day to Kerikeri but when we got to the airport the next day someone had decided to take us off that flight! The flight itself was good food was good although the drinks cart was way behind the food arriving. Staff were pleasant except for the false information and this plane had plenty of room. Air New Zealand is usually good to fly with and yes things can go wrong. But lack of communication and competence of some staff really made for a terrible end to a great holiday. I would say I would never fly them again but we don't have many choices in New Zealand and they are really the lesser of the other evils!

Seats were great and I had plenty of leg room (I am 6'5") I had an exit seat thinking there would be more but they were all the same on the A320. I was disappointed that I was not given a meal after paying for a full fare ticket and therefore had to purchase snacks (most of which had sold out already which is highly frustrating). Inflight entertainment was also not included this was $10 per movie which I thought was extremely overpriced! Luckily I put some things on my phone to watch. Some staff were friendly some not so. Free water/tea/coffee - but you get that on any airline. Overall happy but there could be improvements.

Recently had to be diverted from Queenstown to Christchurch due to extremely high winds trying to land in Queenstown. Once in Christchurch Air New Zealand staff were excellent they arranged and paid for accommodation the shuttle to get to the hotel and breakfast the following morning. They then notified us at our hotels about our flight that had been arranged the following day and then collected us all by shuttle to get us back to the airport on time. We had a smooth flight into Queenstown the following day. The situation was handled extremely well.

I flew HKG to AKL with Air NZ. Having flown Cathay Pacific on three long haul sectors I was looking forward to the flight. I was so disappointed and astounded how bad their business class product has become. Both the food and wine were not up to standard. The Airshow system was not working and the entertainment choices were very poor. The seats are not lie flat until you complete something akin to a military exercise to set up a bed with a mattress. Cost cutting measures are so evident as even the bread rolls look smaller and the hot face towels given to you look like they have been cut in half. The four flight stewards did their best but who on earth decided to dress them in tight waist coats and aprons? Other airlines I have flown provide a far better level of service at a lower fare and I will not be flying Air New Zealand again on their long haul sectors as I do not think they look after their business class passengers like other airlines. Their tenure as a 4 star airline must be looking very shaky indeed.

We flew round trip AKL to PPT. Our trip started with a 2 hour delay which was poorly communicated. They claimed it was due to a "seat" which needed to be repaired. This delay caused us a lot of trouble and extra cost as we missed our connection that night as well as first nights accommodation on an island resort - not cheap. The flight was uncomfortable at 5+ hours on an old 767 which was unclean. The guide in the seat pocket was full of chewing gum. Furthermore the volume on the safety video was so loud that passengers had to cover their ears. The video in general was also excessively long overly animated and ridiculous. Our second flight with ANZ we were already completely put off by this video and found it annoying. The crew served water from an unclean looking plastic pitcher. Never seen this on an airline before not even on a low cost carrier. Furthermore the audacity that ANZ charges a hefty membership "fee" to join their frequent flyer programme - first time hearing about this.

NZ-2 LAX-LHR. Worst airline selection I have ever made. I should have gone with either Virgin Atlantic or BA. The economy section in the 777-300 is a complete joke. I know Air New Zealand is making extra money by having 10 seats across in economy but at what cost? I will never fly with them again and I am sure many other passengers who experience this economy section feel the same way. I really felt like a sardine packed in a can in that airplane. To make matters worse there was no individual airflow control. The plane was hot the whole flight to the point you were sweating in your seat. The only positive was that I had a friendly flight attendant who gave me free drinks towards the end of the flight because she felt so bad for the people on the plane.

Flew AKL-LAX-LHR and back 30th June out 14th July return. I had a seat each for me and my two kids both under 5. All of the crews were fantastic with them going out of their way to assure our comfort. The crew as we approached LHR were exceptional and took the initiative of laying on a "Meet & Assist" at LHR which was such a help and a great touch. Check in at AKL was brilliant abysmal at LHR but that was the only down point of an otherwise excellent trip. Kids loved the most of the food though spaghetti is a tough one to feed a toddler on a plane! Didn't get a chance to test the TV I grabbed sleep when the kids slept!

### Air New Zealand customer review
Heathrow to LA in Economy. This was my first and last time flying with Air NZ. Firstly the best aspect was the crew friendliness. They seem good fun and genuinely happy to help. The ones I chatted to really hate the 777-300 aircraft. One said it wasn't designed to 4 seats in middle row and she seemed genuinely sorry for the customers squashed in a middle seat. A result of having an extra seat in the middle has meant that the aisles have got narrower. I really felt sorry for the crew having to walk sideways a lot of the time. I was in an aisle seat and was constantly being bashed by the crew and passengers waking past. Clearly they are trying to squeeze out as much profit at the expense of customer comfort. I paid extra for a "preferred seat" and apparently this includes a row behind a leg room seat. Not sure why I had to pay extra for this seat that was no different to any other regular row. When the guy in front put his seat back I felt so claustrophobic and could hardly see my TV screen. The food was very average and I waited over 80 minutes to be served an alcoholic drink with my meal. Being offered a glass of tap water just after take-off is very poor and not what you'd expect from a very expensive "4 star airline. The choice of films is very limited and very few new titles. I'll most certainly be flying on BA A380 next time I go to LA.

### Air New Zealand customer review
NZ to Osaka via Narita. Multiple delays before take off resulting in missed connection and an overnight stay in Tokyo. Very poor communication from staff and despite promises made about contacting my waiting family - none made! They made no effort to get me on earliest flight possible - just you will take what you are given mentality. Due to late arrival and early departure - no evening meal or breakfast was available (despite vouchers). Then had to bus transfer across to Haneda - then discover I could have caught an earlier flight. Air New Zealand is a very poor airline trading on what used to be a good reputation.

### Air New Zealand customer review
My wife and I were scheduled to fly on Air New Zealand NZ7 (San Francisco to Auckland) on 29 March. This flight was delayed due to mechanical problems and then cancelled. We were offered hotel accommodation an hours drive from the airport but at 12.30am the bus transport to the hotel had not arrived and was in some doubt. I then checked with ground staff and was told that we could obtain compensation for an SFO airport hotel by claiming online. We then checked back into the airport Hyatt Regency where we had been staying and were in bed by 1.20am unlike those who waited for the bus They got to bed after 3.00am. (They had to be up for the 5am bus back to the airport). When we finally arrived home I contacted Air New Zealand online and was advised to contact their customer relations team. This I did my requests for information go unanswered. The aircraft for the cancelled flight was an ancient 747. The aircraft that replaced it was also an ancient 747. The replacement aircraft had cabin lights that flickered along with flickering on the video screen. We were told the first aircraft had an electrical problem that prevented it from starting.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flew an old ropey 737-300 from AKL-WLG domestic route within New Zealand. Firstly crew are unfriendly and rude. Seats lumpy and very uncomfortable. Plane was dirty - clearly had not been cleaned for weeks with finger marks smeared across the window litter from previous flight - sweet wrappers strewn across the floor fold out tray sticky with dried up coffee spilled. looking down on the floor clearly not vacuumed for weeks with gooey grime around the seat fixings. Seat covers peeling off. Was offered a thimble of water and a stale cookie as food. The overhead screens are so out of focus that you have to strain your eyes to watch it. All of this for premium prices. Basically Air New Zealand operate a low-cost budget operation at sky high prices and compared with the other options I'd say avoid Air New Zealand domestic if you can help it.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flew from Los Angeles to Auckland on the new 777-300 in the space seats. Great mood lighting in the cabin. We were in row 28JK. The seats are comfortable and stylish and face towards the windows for a great view on take off and landing. The flight crew were smiles all around offered us a drink before take off so had a glass of bubbly. Supper was served on this late flight and we both had creamy crab and smoked salmon salad braised lamb with wholegrain mustard mash and veggies delicious. Settled down to watch a movie good selection. With pillow and blanket made myself comfortable in our seats instructions for the seat are in the seat pocket. Great flight home with great service.

### Air New Zealand customer review
I fly on a fairly regular basis over the last 2 or 3 years I would fly from Auckland to Singapore every couple of months on Jetstar or Qantas and I fly economy. This last 3 months I have flown from Auckland to Los Angeles last month on Virgin this week on Air New Zealand. The problem flying Virgin is that I need a stop in Sydney having said that the fare is a good price the service between Auckland and Sydney and Sydney and Los Angeles was good - very good. On the return I had to fly Virgin to Sydney but an Air New Zealand code share between Sydney and AKL that was the down part of the journey. Narrow seats tatty aircraft pay for a meal pay for everything - the complete opposite of the similar virgin segment on the outward journey. I figured it was because it was a transtasman that Air New Zealand treat passengers like cattle and nickel and dime them but this last trip I decided to go Auckland-LAX direct. Air New Zealand charge $300 more than their rivals you get 1 bag unlike Virgin where you get 2 the plane is dirty the cabin crew are ok a couple were a little off hand to the person in the seat beside me no blanket no eye cover no little pack of toothpaste. I guess for me it was just a disappointment I thought they were better and I remember a few years ago they were now they are just a budget airline that charge a premium price based on a past reputation. I will continue to use them for speed but if I have time I would choose Virgin Australia or Qantas.

AKL to NRT B777-200 economy class. My flight was delayed 30 minutes but still arrived in Tokyo on time. The seat was quite cramped and uncomfortable even though I'm not a tall person. Meals were average and not enough for me. One plus point is that the ice cream was tasty. The entertaining programmes were very limited and picture quality of my TV screen was not good. Flight attendants were friendly enough. Honestly I expected more from a 4-star airline like Air New Zealand.

### Air New Zealand customer review
My wife and I flew to Tonga from Auckland on 5th July 2014 and returned 12th July 2014 The aircraft used on both sectors was a 19 year old 767-300. The aircraft was in pretty good order considering it's age. Departure pretty well on time. Friendly staff. Idiotic Bear Grylls safety video. Reasonable selection of audio video. Food awful vegetable frittata Air NZ has been serving for some time now. Return food much better - beef salad or butter chicken. One water round on each flight. Kia Ora" Inflight magazine no longer in every seat back. No more than twelve copies available from magazine rack at forward cabin. Toilets clean and tidy. This is the only airline surfacing Tonga from Auckland. Good flights both ways.

### Air New Zealand customer review
NZ 2 Auckland to LAX on July 13th 2014. The cabin temperature was so hot! I mentioned about the temperature several times to flight attendants. It seemed as if they agreed. I have never been on a flight where the temperature was so hot. The seats were so close together. The girl next to me was practically on my lap and she was leaning on me the whole time. For whatever reason some of the NZ planes have seats that are too high that my feet don't touch the floor. Yes I'm short! You would think that seat-proximity wouldn't matter but it still does. There's nowhere to put my feet except to have them dangle. On a 12 hour flight with my feet dangling my knees were killing me! There were no footrests or anything. I put my handbag on the floor so I could put my feet up on that but it was still uncomfortable. I didn't quite understand why the Trans-Tasman flight from Melbourne to Auckland had reclining foot rests but a 12 hour flight wouldn't? Furthermore the seats are so close that when the person in front of me is reclined if I'm not reclined I can barely move. Unless something changes drastically by the next time we go back to New Zealand/Australia I will not be taking Air New Zealand. On a side note the staff try to be friendly and helpful but that is their job. I can't really say that they are any more or less friendly/helpful that staff on other airlines. The food was decent. The wine is always nice. Entertainment needs to be updated. On a good note the flight from Melbourne to Auckland on July 11th was fantastic. But the other 3 flights I've had with Air NZ including this one were terrible.

### Air New Zealand customer review
I flew AKL-LAX on 24 June NZ2 returning LAX-AKL on 1 July on NZ5. I was in Business Class both ways. The service and attention to detail is exemplary. Even in the middle of the night pushing the call button got immediate attention. The food both ways was exceptional and it was always nice to be asked if I would like some more or is their anything else I can get you. In these days of cost cutting in service and staff on tight contracts Air NZ staff really do go that extra mile and really do look like they enjoy their jobs. The flights arrived early both ends which is always welcomed the pilots very rarely get the recognition they deserve in these surveys.

### Air New Zealand customer review
My family and I flew from Los Angeles to Rarotonga and return June 15 June 28 Business class. The plane is an older 767-300. The only two possible things I could mention are (1) the seats are not very wide although adequate. (2) the inflight entertainment is somewhat dated. Thing is entertaining us is not what a good airline is all about; getting from point "A" to point "B" in a timely safe manner is and ANZ is a good airline.

### Air New Zealand customer review
I recently took Air New Zealand to Sydney as part of a ticket with connections to a Vietnam Airlines Flight. Arrived early at Auckland Airport checked in with a customer service staff as their cost cutting exercise with no check in counters means that the check in kiosk does not work for when taking connecting flights and having to check your bags through. Arrived early at the gate ready to board at 6.15 am only to board 10 minutes prior to departure meaning we departed late as they have just one staff in charge of the boarding process. When on board felt like a sardine especially with the larger man in front of me with the seat bending back badly. Aircraft certainly ageing and seat very hard and uncomfortable. Food and drink okay but very basic. Entertainment outdated as well was watching something had already seen before. The Air New Zealand staff very casual and not really smiling at all and don't really care about the passengers as long as they are being paid. Can not recommend taking Air New Zealand again.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Horrible to say the least! My first experience was not one to remember. San Francisco to Auckland on an old plane with ripped seats flight 7 seat A40. The entertainment system was broken in my seat nice job for 12 hours watching nothing with no seats to move to. Once I arrived to Auckland found out not only was my first trip cancelled to Palmerston North but they cancelled it again for the second time each time having to retrieve my luggage and go through the process all over. Then to add insult to the situation they put me on my third flight now 6 hours after when I was supposed to fly and there was a flight which left in between this time frame and I wasn't put on that because it was "oversold". My advice don't fly them.

### Air New Zealand customer review
First experience on Air NZ. Was on the 'works" fare and it does work. Great wine and food selection. Staff were pleasant and seemed to be interact with most customers. The only disappointing part was the entertainment choice. The plane was old and had to use the remote to change channels. Overall a good flight from SYD-AKL and back.

### Air New Zealand customer review
LHR to LAX and back a week later in Premium Economy. It was really excellent on all fronts: friendly and efficient service from check-in to arrival. The food was plentiful and very nice quality: a salad starter with fresh bread and NZ olive oil a warm meal; dessert cheese and biscuits and good NZ wines. Breakfast and afternoon tea were also excellent with e.g. warm scones clotted cream and jam. The food was better than BA's Club World. The seat provides lots of space and the entertainment system is stocked with films I missed at the cinema so enjoyed catching up with on the plane. The seat doesn't recline that much but there's a bean bag a big pillow and a nice thoughtful amenity kit. There were other fun touches too like a photo of shelves of books with jokey titles on the walls in the toilet. On the way out the luggage belts at Heathrow were broken so most bags did not make it to the plane. Air NZ handled this efficiently on the plane and with minimal fuss in LA we were handed US$100 in cash. This is my first time with Air NZ it's such a shame they don't fly to more places from Britain!

Flying today with Air NZ MEL-AKL and I cant even buy food on the plane! Been told I need a credit card to buy anything and since I don't have one I guess I've got to sort my own food.

### Air New Zealand customer review
BNE-CHC-BNE. What a difference a crew makes. BNE-CHC (NZ805) flight on 16 June was very empty but crew not very interested in working. As a VA Platinum member not offered the usual services (headphones express immigration etc) that normally would be offered. Seemed a challenge to even get a glass of wine (I was on a 'works' fare). While the in-flight manager was busy spending all of his time with 2 passengers not much care shown to the rest of us on the airplane. Return CHC-BNE (NZ804) on 20 June was a different story. Fantastic crew (2 in-flight managers so perhaps a check or training flight). Service was great attentive and friendly. Food good and drinks offered plentiful. This crew made all the difference in turning a bad experience outbound into a great experience inbound.

### Air New Zealand customer review
NZ80 HKG to AKL. 22nd June 2014. Business Class. B777-200ER. The aircraft was old and shabby. The herringbone seat configuration facing away from the window is like a coffin. The seat is narrow and has limited recline when seated normally as the lay flat bed requires the seat back to be folded fully forward. The bed is reasonably comfortable with the mattress pad. The welcome aboard drink was Sparking Wine not Champagne and served by one of the 3 Grumpy Old Men who were attending the forward cabin. Food was just edible and the choices very poor. No wines listed and when asked was told Pinot Noir or Cab Sav. No hangars suitable to hang trousers for those who change into travelling clothes. The AV is something out of the ark. A screen that has a resolution such that everything looks as if the lens is smeared with Vaseline. A controller whereby when pressed takes a few seconds to respond and sound and screen hesitation on both movie and audio channels (seat 3A if anyone from AirNZ read these posts). Breakfast coffee was vile but the hot bacon roll was a pleasant change. I hope the B777-300 is a step up as I have a west coast return trip soon. If not I shall stick to SQ and EK for all my long haul trips. There are better alternatives and the penny pinching shows maybe this route doesn't justify anything better but even CX with the dated A340 aircraft on this route is a much better experience.

My husband and I recently few from Sydney to Apia via Auckland. We checked in online and printed our own boarding passes to save time and lock our seats in. When we arrived at the airport we had to go through the whole process again making our online check in pointless. The first leg of the journey was on a reasonably comfortable Boeing 777-200 but the second leg was on an Airbus A320 which was one of the most cramped airline seats I've ever sat on. Both planes felt old and tired. The meal we had was adequate but nothing more. I was quite disappointed overall but one thing I'll say is the stay were very friendly and helpful.

Flew Auckland to Narita in premium economy in a 777-200. Seat was fine helped by the fact that seat next to me was unoccupied. Service from staff was very good friendly and efficient. You don't appear to get bubbly/juice before departure anymore and the choice of wines was same as in economy. Meals were good and tasty. Massive choice of movies.

### Air New Zealand customer review
There is not often that you are sorry to get of the plane but I was after my trip with Air New Zealand. My husband and I flew Air New Zealand to the United States in May. Having flown various airlines before Air New Zealand is right up there with the best. The service given by their more mature staff was exceptional compared with other airlines who use a younger cabin crew. The only reason I rate the satisfaction of my trip 9/10 is that they code share with United who must come bottom of my list (the trip with United between New York and Los Angeles the worst I have ever had). If you fly Air New Zealand to the United States organize your onward trip yourself so that you can avoid flying United.

SYD to AKL in Business. The check in is like buying a Hamburger just unfriendly. You can see cost cutting here. The lounge in Sydney is out dated and is in need of urgent renovation. The food service is very basic. Onboard extreme cost cutting has taken effect. Considering the amount paid and the service received I would say that there a very little features and benefits. Would not travel NZ again than for the same price I will get much superior service by the opposition.

I flew from Auckland to LAX recently in business class. From the time I sat down it took 55 minutes to be served a drink while it took my wife an hour and ten minutes to receive her first beverage. The service during the flight was adequate but possible I expected more considering the price of the ticket. I would not recommend Air New Zealand but I would also not discourage one from flying this airline.

My business partner and I flew Auckland/Queenstown on 20 May returning the next day. I don't normally comment on domestic flights but these two flights need recognition for the stellar service provided by Air New Zealand. It was two newish A320's either way and manned by some of the best staff I have encountered. We were Star Alliance Gold so had the options of seats in Row 1. Water tea/coffee and snacks were provided and a second cup was available for anyone that wanted. Well done Air New Zealand!

### Air New Zealand customer review
San Francisco to Melbourne and may I say never again. I checked in at Seattle (flew with United from SEA-SFO) so my baggage was fine. Arrived at SFO to find out that my aircraft was delayed 6 hours and were never told why. Got on board to have the crew be rude. I had a small child sitting next to me constantly reaching over my tray table and stealing my food from me neither the father or cabin crew did something even when asked. Once arriving in Auckland I had a transit time of what was now reduced to 5 hours originally being 12. When returning to the airport there was a mistake in short-checking my bag as the system still showed my bag checked through to Melbourne. After having this all happen I then had my carry-on luggage weighed. I had taken items out in AKL. I was then found that my bag was 0.5kg over and that it couldn't travel with me even if it was checked. After a lot of negotiation I was finally allowed to take my bag as carry on. Onboard my trans-tasman flight it was quite pleasant however not as great as other airlines I have experienced. I don't recommend Air NZ to anybody.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flew to LAX from Auckland on May 13 2014 and from San Francisco to Auckland on May 27. The return flight had a horrible selection of movies and TV. The food on both flights was abysmal. There is nothing I can really order to eat that suits my dietary requirements so I chose vegetarian as a last resort. Horrible choice. Will have to bring my own food in future but shouldn't I get a discount for not being provided with a meal?

### Air New Zealand customer review
My first two flights on NZ Air within the last two years were lovely. The food was good the seats decent. I was surprised and impressed that we were given little packs with toothpicks toothpaste etc and there were numerous new movies to watch. This trip from New Zealand to LA was quite different. The chicken was grisly and tough actually inedible there was no little pack to charm us and the seats were tighter. I'm a slim person and felt claustrophobic. I'm looking for a different airline for my next flights from New Zealand. I'd rather pay a little more and enjoy the long flight.

Sydney to YVR via Auckland on 11th May. Airbus A320 SYD - Auckland a joke cramped and ridiculous should not be used for a 3.5 hour journey Auckland to YVR on 777-200ER different story plane showing age however was quite comfortable selected vegetarian option surprisingly good did the reverse journey leaving YVR 28th May again 777-200 ER YVR to Auckland and a much better option 767-300 Auckland to Sydney service efficient. If 777-200ER seating configuration changes to a 3-4-3 as envisaged I definitely would not travel on Air New Zealand management should be forced to endure these cramped seats for 12-14 hours and see way at it feels like.

AKL-YVR B777-200ER. Flight on time. Crew professional and friendly. Regular water runs for overnight flight. Meals were good. IFE provides a good selection but would have benefited from more new releases. Seats were comfortable and I managed to get some sleep. Aisles were somewhat narrow and I understand that the seat configuration is being changed to 3-4-3. I do wonder how uncomfortable this would make this 12 hour flight.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Napier-Auckland-Napier . Two smooth on time flights with the ATR 72 offering more comfort than many short haul jets. Service friendly and professional. Water/coffee/tea and biscuit offered as is the norm for short haul flights within NZ. Some readers bemoan this but would you get similar on a bus or train trip of one hour? Air NZ still offers boiled sweets prior to landing which is a simple but nice touch. Luggage delivered promptly at both ends and check-in efficient too whether assisted (Napier) or through automated machine (Auckland). Auckland Airport domestic terminal is a little tired and dull but it still works.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flew from BNE-AKL-LAX on the 777-300 for both legs. Paid extra for the paired seats which Air New Zealand sells as 'Preferred' seats. Sat in 35a through to Auckland which was alright. Good to be towards the front of the plane for disembarking but the seats are quite narrow and cramped. Sat in 57k onto LA which was slightly better. Missed out on preferred meal but only because I was right down the end. Food was the best I've had in a long time. Entertainment was great and the ability to order drinks from your screen is very handy. It also means no bells going off through the flight for service. Flight attendants were pretty average. Not great but not rude. I drank a lot of Sauvignon Blanc which was delicious and from New Zealand. All in all or was an average flight. Don't know how I would have felt in the middle section of 4 seats. It clearly isn't comfortable for such a long flight so I don't understand why more airlines are installing this seating pattern.

Flew B777-300 from Brisbane-AKL. Seat service food and were exemplary. Could not fault any point of the service. While I did not get to fully experience the flat-bed that Air New Zealand offers when I had the seat fully reclined I nearly fell asleep. This is a first. Did not use IFE although by the looks of things it was modern with a great selection of movies/TV shows.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flew on a B767-300 Short Haul. The food drink and service was substantially better than Economy with Air NZ which was excellent as I would rate Air NZ economy service highly. Great selection of modern movies and shows with IFE. The seat while dated was sufficiently comfortable for my 6'3 build. However people who have a slightly larger girth may struggle with the seat. Moving past another passenger from the window seat was also a tricky situation. However overall a very pleasant experience would certainly recommend.

### Air New Zealand customer review
My first trip to NZ what a disappointment. Our economy seats were cramped indeed claustrophobic as the passengers in front insisted on having their seats fully reclined for the majority of both legs of the journey to Auckland effectively preventing use of the inflight entertainment system. The cabin temperature was very cool and we were advised by staff that this was ongoing problem with this particular aircraft. The food quality was at best average comparable to budget airlines servicing Europe. That said the selection of wines offered is very good. The first leg of the return journey was made more bearable by purchasing a Skycouch option but should one have to do this on an ultra long distance flight? Reluctantly we will have to consider other carriers for our next trip.

Bought the upgrade for the Premium Economy seats on the 300 Series plane from Auckland to LAX and was ill from the heat. Flight attendants shared that these planes continually have issues with heat - and our video screen had messages from the "pilot" apologizing throughout the flight. I walked the length of the plane and found that some areas were okay but my guesstimate of 84+ degrees F in the area I was seated was not the only one getting cooked. I reached overhead for my laptop and one point and discovered that the storage area was significantly hotter than that! Miserable flight.

SYD-RAR NZ60 with a purchased one up. Being an old 767 seats were comfortable enough but nothing to write home about. Generally overall disappointing and have had better seats food and service in Y+ on 773. There was no amenity pack supplied and I had to ask for a toothbrush. That said staff themselves were friendly enough if not overtly taking the initiative with food and drinks!

### Air New Zealand customer review
NZ745 RAR-AKL then NZ709 AKL-SYD both in Y. Full-ish flights and friendly enough crews. F&B were good as far as they went but service was slow with an apparent reluctance to offer more than 1 drink with the works. Seats were bog standard Y for 320 but it does seem that seats on all airlines in Y get smaller as I get older! As a use of Airpoints this was good value for money.

### Air New Zealand customer review
MEL-CHC-WLG on A320. Booked and paid for Exit Row seats on the Works and it was fantastic. Seats were ok but extra legroom a real advantage. Water offered after take off and then given a choice of a frittata with bacon and sausages or a healthy fruit breakfast. The flight team were great and had a laugh with the passengers. Movies were also great to watch and the inflight system with movies and map a gem. Arrived in Christchurch on time and went through customs etc. Collected bag and walked to domestic terminal for flight to Wellington. Lounge in Christchurch was great. Excellent choice of food and drinks. Boarded flight to Wellington on an old 737-300 which was in pristine condition. Crew were great on what turned out to be a 25 min flight. Overall a great flight with an excellent team. Just hope they can get rid of the "self" check in arrangements at most airports. Go back to some personalised service.

NZ90 777-200 from Japan to Auckland. Business class. Plane was almost on time departing. Food was dreadful - in the last 18 months the food on AIR NZ has taken a serious nosedive - dinner so poor that I didn't bother with breakfast. Service was the usual indifference. Entertainment system is a joke and the plane is grubby. Only good thing is the lie flat bed - best approach when flying on the 777-200 is to eat at the airport then lie down and sleep the whole flight!

NZ443 Auckland to Wellington on 18 April 2014. The seating on this flight was comfortable enough but the connection from an international to a domestic flight at Auckland airport really needs to be improved (though this is obviously not the fault of Air New Zealand). The flight itself however was delayed and no calls were made about the delay until 40 minutes after the scheduled departure time. Better communication is needed.

I fly Air NZ 8-10 times a year mostly domestic / trans-tasman flights. On domestic routes it's a no brainer. Main routes are serviced by almost brand new A320s and the rest by fairly new Q300's and ATR 72's. All crew members (like all kiwis) are very polite and helpful. Only downside is very basic food/beverage service (coffee/tea + water + cookie) on domestic flights. Long haul not so flash compared to eg Singapore Airlines or Emirates but still decent standard. Heaps of discounted domestic flights if you buy in advance.

ANZ18 Rarotonga to LAX flight on 15 Feb and we spent an extra night on the island because of crew illness. How could a "leading world-class airline" have a situation where they can't have a pilot or steward on stand-by in case of illness? It was a somewhat chaotic scene at the Raro airport. Lots of passengers waiting for instructions and not one ANZ staff member for two or more hours! When they finally appeared the staff were friendly and polite alright but it took them too long to show up at the airport to help us and our hotel had already informed us hours earlier that the flight was canceled so we checked in with ANZ to get the info about what to do and then checked back in to our old room (a complete waste of an evening) Air New Zealand offered to buy our dinner at 10pm! We made it home (after missed connections) about two days late.

Business Class LAX to Auckland and return. Food is marginal at best. They served a hamburger! Awful. Staff not very helpful or friendly. Seats are not that good. Lie flat is cramped and overheated and not comfortable. Nothing good to say about this airline. I thought US airlines couldn't hack it internationally. Never again.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Just flew from LAX to AKL on ANZ in business class. It is what business class should be like. Very attentive staff although the food is getting a bit downgraded and staff at the LAX lounge are just okay I think the majority of staff are now subcontractors so do not have the Kiwi values except for long term staff. Air NZ needs to be careful not to try and squeeze out too much profit yet is still offers one of the best business classes in the field. Just fly UAL from Sydney and see how they have not really upped their game. I wish they would match AirNZ.

Bought a two week Rarotonga/Aitutaki trip first class hotels business class airfare outbound had OBE problems had to move seats food was mediocre seats old and not comfortable for J class overnight seating. Arrival arrangements went well inter-island travel was challenging because of Air New Zealand's confusing docs re luggage weight allowances. On return day AIT to RAR ANZ pilot took ill so we were forced to layover a night in Raro. After waiting over 4 hours at Raro airport for ANZ staff to appear ANZ proved totally inattentive to our needs making us wait in the dark literally and then they refused to pay for our dinner that night (we ate it too early 7pm) and staff didn't arrive at airport until 9pm) when we knew well before ANZ staff appeared at the airport that we needed to eat because there would be no "on-board" service that evening. A horrible experience no follow up save your money and book your own trip/hotels through Fiji.

My husband and I flew San Francisco to Auckland NZ 7 on 30th March. Flight delayed due to an electrical fault due to board at 7.45pm but were eventually seated at 10.15e. Then informed that the paperwork required to had not been produced and waited a further 1 hour 45 mins this at least gave the pilot time to reboot the entertainment units which weren't working. We had purchased seats with extra leg room which had the entertainment units folded into the seat frame. We were aware that the units would have to be folded away during take off and as the system required rebooting we entertained ourselves by reading. As the safety instruction began a stewardess suddenly snapped at us to "please pay attention to the safety video" which she only then seemed to realise we hadn't accessed. My husband however was quite happy to follow the video right up to the point where you're asked to check if you've turned all your electrical equipment to flight mode. It was at this point that the stewardess roundly set upon him as he as per instruction checked his iPod. It was demanded that he turn it off immediately followed by a barked demand to know if he'd done so. This set the tone for the rest of the flight. At no stage before or during our flight did we say or do anything to warrant this sort of attitude. Also my husbands entertainment systems kept cutting out during the flight. I'd like to say that the ground staff who rescheduled our connecting flight and the members of that crew were great.

AKL-PER in the 3x3x3 configuration. As regular Perth trippers (like 25 over 20 years) it was one of the most uncomfortable disappointing trips we have experienced. One needs to be almost a contortionist to extricate oneself for toilet visits due to 2 things. One is the closeness of the seat in front when it is reclined coupled with the fact that the intermediate arm rest will not lift high enough to get around comfortably but having achieved that one still has to negotiate around the aisle arm rest which would not lift at all! My wife and I are not high body-mass people! Food quality was definitely not up to previous standards. Trying to play a favourite CD became a rather user/unfriendly mission and when I did get it it was punctuated and disjointed. On disembarking we eyed the PE seats with new interest and are contemplating an upgrade on our return but it shouldn't have to be like that. We get the feeling that passenger comfort/satisfaction in the standard economy class has been compromised by the extreme pressure the airline is under to return a satisfactory performance to the shareholders. We remain loyal to our own airline but are seriously questioning the cost.

NZ288 from Shanghai to Auckland on B777-200 in Business Class seats 3A and 3B - very good comfort in sleeping in case of flat bed seating comfort good. Staff very friendly and professional. Catering - not really a positive surprise perhaps in case of the Shanghai route hard oriented to Chinese food and not New Zealand. However if you're booked on the 777 it's ok if the flight is operated on the 767-300 - forget it ! The flight back from Auckland to Shanghai (12 hours) was really poor on the very narrow recliner seats of the old 767´s.

### Air New Zealand customer review
ANZ 289 from Auckland to Shanghai - this time on Boeing 767-300 in Business Class. Seat 2A and 2B. Seat quality - poor as the seats are too narrow! The monitors are stored in the middle armrest that leads to a very small seat less felt wide as in ECO. Recliner would be ok but the width is very poor for a 12 hours flight in Business Class! Team great food - in case of the Shanghai trip very "Chinese oriented" and not typical for ANZ hopefully. So if the flight is done by a 767-300 - avoid! The 777-200 seat quality is much better.

We travelled from Auckland to San Francisco on Air New Zealand's 747. This was a non stop flight and although the food and service were ok only the entertainment system was extremely disappointing. It was antiquated - limited movies music games and news. The push button hand control needed extra pressure going over. On the return flight it was not possible to get any music at all. The system was rebooted (nothing); I was taken to two other seats (still no music). Compared to Emirates' flights this experience with Air NZ was extremely disappointing.

NZ8 AKL to SFO departure was delayed as the air conditioning wasn't working on the ground when we got on the plane was still warm. Video system was not working so attendant suggested using middle seat screen but aisle seat passenger had to use it as his audio was not working. After waiting 30 mins turns out it was working but no one bothered to advise me it had been reset. Crew couldn't turn down overhead lights after meal and surprisingly comment cards never appeared for feedback. Sent an email 5 days ago & no response. 747 looked worn out.

### Air New Zealand customer review
I have travelled on a number of occasions from Melbourne to Christchurch and have much admired the unique qualities of that experience as an introduction to NZ. On the last occasion this was on a code sharing flight with Virgin. The experience reversed my previous appreciation of the introduction to NZ. The best of NZ Airlines seems to have been undermined by the worst of Virgin. I watched an Air NZ ground staff member stand by and instruct my wife to load her weighty suitcase on to the luggage belt before I could intervene. My wife had spent the previous two days undergoing heart check ups. Furthermore I was impressed to note the speed with which the ground staff requested an extra 80 dollars for an extra bag when it was reasonably evident that the extra bag could have been packed into the non-extra one. Please note that the comment rating relates to the experience in the code sharing flight with Virgin.

Flight NZ 8046 Christchurch to Wellington 19 March 2014. Our flight yesterday went beyond just "good service" it was excellent service. This is not necessarily because anything out of the ordinary happened on our flight but rather because our Air New Zealand pilots and cabin attendant just did the ordinary things particularly well. No fuss no bother just professionalism. We felt comfortable happy and safe and when it is all said and done that's why one chooses to fly with a particular airline.

### Air New Zealand customer review
I flew from SFO to Auckland. The entertainment system is phenomenal. I did not run out of movies to choose from the whole plane ride was not enough for me to watch all the movies available unlike the other airlines with limited movies. Other airlines like United charges for entertainment access (ridiculous). The food is filling and the unlimited wine helped. The seats are very comfy with plenty of leg room the only problem is getting out when the people seating in front of you all have their seats reclined it gets pretty tricky. Nevertheless I will certainly chose Air New Zealand again if given the chance.

### Air New Zealand customer review
NZ 9 and 10 flights from Auckland to Honolulu return. This could not be considered even remotely close to what business class travel should be. Check your own bags in late departure with no reason given shoddy lounge poor food and beverage choice with disinterested slow cabin staff. The plane itself is worn out too. I would definitely not be encouraging anyone to pay to fly air NZ business class. Might be just worth the cost of an economy ticket.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Regular ANZ flyer most recently SYD-AKL 7th Feb 2014 then WEL-SYD 12th Feb. Seat+Bag ticket. SYD-AKL on larger plane (777). Boarding was an issue - boarding gate too small for size of plane/number of passengers and then many passengers started queuing up before boarding called which meant that boarding by row numbers was a bit pointless. Onboard all good as usual although was very cold and I had to get a blanket also I'm a bit sick of the Hobbit safety video. Service great - lots of staff on hand to help with self check-in and bag drop. Onboard didn't have much to do with staff but seemed fine as usual. Used ANZ smartphone app for first time - very nice app and easy to use with helpful info. WEL-SYD on A320. Online check-in easy. Much easier boarding with smaller plane. Otherwise flight similar. Overall - not used to the larger plane with longer boarding and alighting time and I don't really like it so will try to avoid in future bookings. Seats also seemed closer together? Entertainment OK but could have done with a few more TV shows to choose from. Don't really like their new system of paying extra for the preferential seats but understand that there is an opportunity for them to make a bit of extra profit there. Glad to have finally got some frequent flyer points for this trans-Tasman flight as previously they have not given this with the cheaper seats.

We flew MEL-LAX return in Business Premier on 3rd Dec returning 19th Jan. Although our 5th trip with Air NZ this was our first time travelling Business. I was impressed from the moment we were on the plane we were warmly greeted by the hostess and whilst getting settled were offered a pre-take off drink whilst the other passengers were boarding. At this time they also take an order for your pre-dinner drink to be served once cruising altitude is reached. Drinks and Food came out promptly and was of a high quality impressed that we were not presented with standard airline food. The lie flat beds were comfortable enough to get a few hours sleep on the long flight and definitely worth the extra money we spent. Entertainment system provided plenty of choice to suit a range of tastes making the trip going very fast. We had the same positive experience on our flight home and cannot praise Air NZ enough for such an enjoyable journey.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flew round trip from LAX to Rarotonga. The flight into Raro was fine except for the simply fair quality of food. The seating in economy was comfortable for a 9 hour overnight international flight. My primary complaint is about the terribly long lines for check-in at Raro for the Saturday night departure to LAX. The check-in counter is outside in a warm and humid climate and there are only 3 or 4 people working to serve scores of passengers and handle their baggage. We stood in line for over 1.5 hours even though we arrived 2 hours ahead of departure. There's obviously poor management for a process that occurs once per week and seemingly could easily be remedied by having a couple of more persons on staff for this check-in installation of some kiosks a faster computer system and some fans outside of the counter area. If you're infirm elderly or don't want your vacation capped off by a very unpleasant experience on your departure consider some other destination (or perhaps Virgin Australia).

### Air New Zealand customer review
For me the self-check-in did not work out properly. In Wellington I was kindly assisted by someone from Air NZ . Also for my return flight home the self-check-in was aborted and had to go to the kiosk in Auckland. For my last trip from Auckland (NZ) to Dusseldorf (D) there I could only get a boarding pass for just the flight from Auckland to Sydney. For the other boarding passes I had to find my way in Sydney to get the next boarding passes. Very inconvenient and stressful especially when one needs an aisle seat because of physical handicap. Finally has it been handled well by the staff of Etihad.

### Air New Zealand customer review
SFO-AKL round-trip. Seat pitch adequate for my 6'1' husband but footrest is useless does not come up high enough for anyone. Recline adequate for nap. Attentive staff. Meals well presented and fairly good. Entertainment system needs refurbishment remotes in both directions needed work and sound wasn't working properly in my seat on the return. I'm pretty sure that they used the same equipment on the outbound flight as I heard a person in my (future) seat making the same complaint about the sound on the outbound leg and wasn't surprised (but was disappointed) to discover that it had not been fixed a week later (or if fixed broke again already). Choice of entertainment good when working. Efficient ground staff. Notification of delay on the return was timely and adequate. Amenity kit and water bottle holder very useful but avoid front row of premium economy where it just becomes an annoyance because there is no storage.

### Air New Zealand customer review
SYD-AKL-LAX and LAX-AKL-SYD. Consistently warm helpful and willing staff. Excellent product on the 777 with the thicker mattress on the bed (compared with Virgin Atlantic) and restaurant quality food and wine selection. Toilets are extremely small but there is a disabled one available in premium economy. Overall excellent interaction despite missed connection due to another carrier. Overall I would always choose to fly with AirNZ if possible. Unfortunately let down by their alliance with United who are the antithesis of everything AirNZ is. Would love them to have wider seats in Business on 767 as I choose to travel in business due to size and not to disturb or impede people next to me if I flew in economy. The 767 seat is my least favourite aspect of the experience.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Auckland to Nadi Fiji on 14/02/2014 (NZ752) and back on 19/02/2014 (NZ753) and on both flights I was not given the food of my choice. On the trip to Nadi they had chicken or salmon but by the time they got to our row (which was only on row 18) they had run out of the chicken. The terrible thing about it was how the flight attendant approached the situation. She said "we've ran out of the chicken and only have salmon will you be happy with that.". No apologies or any kind word to say to a passenger who paid extra for the food! On the return trip same scenario. Except they had a choice of chicken or lamb and they ran out of chicken. Considering we were only in row 15 (and there were so many more rows behind us) to run out of the more popular choice that early on is just not right. I would've been okay with it but the flight attendant gave that same annoying line again "will you be happy with that?". The problem is I do not eat lamb. After I said to the attendant I don't eat lamb she said there was a vegetarian meal that no one has claimed will I be happy with that? again that line! I didn't think I had a choice so yes I will have it but I cannot say I am happy with it.

MEL-AKL-SFO return in J class on NZ's very old 747s. Being a TG Platinum member I don't often travel on other carriers but have no real choice when it comes to the US. Have to say that flying NZ is a predominantly pleasant experience with real food served restaurant style a fantastic lie flat bed (even in the old planes) and great service from experienced cabin crew. So in the air great but on the ground they leave a lot to be desired. The self serve check in at MEL is a joke. It is not a premium service and you need to manually check that your baggage is tagged priority. AKL boarding is a schmozzle with very small gates and loads of passengers. Forget about trying to access the premium boarding gates! So all in all great on board but lousy on ground.

Flew with my business partner AKL-LAX-AKL in Premium Economy on 777-300. Boarding was stress free both sides as we were Premium Economy plus Star Alliance Gold and Koru members so either way we were first on the plane. The flight attendants were available and were there to help right from the start with overhead locker storage etc. Main meals were delivered shortly after take off both ends and the quality of the meals were very similar if not the same to what I've had in business class with each course brought out separately. Quality of the alcohol was good plus it was nice to have a good mug of tea coffee and after dinner mints afterwards. Amenity Packs were the same as in business class. The seat is multi adjustable and obviously nowhere near lie flat but after some adjustment got a nice sleeping position. The seat and footwells accommodated my 6 foot 2 inch frame my only criticism was the footwell that narrows wouldn't accommodate my size 12’s so take your shoes off and rest your feet on the bean bag supplied. The crew both ways were excellent. The quality of service was excellent. The seats being pod design mean your personal space is not encroached on I am disappointed to hear that Premium Economy seating on their Dreamliner or the 777-200 upgrades will not be using this type of seating.

After being an Air NZ fan for 20 plus years just had the worst flight experience on a 777 from San Francisco to Auckland. The flight was overbooked the seats were horribly uncomfortable and the food was terrible. Perhaps Air NZ have fitted another row into economy it is intolerably cramped - my knees touched the seat in front of me and I couldn't comfortably put my arms by my sides for 13 hours! I'm a small woman! The seat in front of me was so close that I couldn't watch a movie! Didn't matter because after 6 hours the entertainment center failed in our row!

I travelled alone to NZ via LA on 17th December returning on 8th January both ways as economy passenger. On the outward flight I was lucky enough to be upgraded to a better seat by the LHR lady who checked me in and was happy with everything. Don't expect to be super comfy in economy but this 'preferred seat' was great. On the return flight on checking in at Christchurch for the hop to Auckland (NZ 546 7/1/14 boarding 19.15) I asked the check in attendant if there was any chance of a better seat (mine was 55F one seat in from the aisle in the central row where I had not enough room to pick up something I had dropped on the floor). I was told in no uncertain terms that "I was lucky to have a seat as this flight is overbooked"! I was pretty annoyed. As I had 24hrs flying ahead of me I decided to remain calm and not react. Fortunately at LA (what a dive that is) I asked tentatively if there was any chance of a change of seat and the attendant was able to offer me a window seat 49A which was so much more comfortable I had room to move for which I was most grateful. Apart from the lady at Christchurch I have nothing but praise for the staff both ground and air.

PER-AKL NZ 0176. Good comfortable seat. Female staff unfriendly unhelpful abrupt and unnecessarily rude to some passengers. Seemed they were plain irritated at being "at work. that day. Sat at back so had to accept what was left on the trolley. Food not very good either. Beverages were also slow in being supplied throughout the trip. Tv plus remote did not function properly so did not watch any entertainment. Co-sharing SAA did not do it for me either on the first leg of my trip from SA. Sat on tarmac for an hour before take-off due to a "technical" problem. Will definitely not fly Air NZ again.

Flew Christchurch-Auckland then Auckland-Tokyo. B767-300 ER. Cabin spotless. Staff were very friendly and talkative. Food was great although I wasn't able choose as one of the options had run out. However the lemon pepper chicken was tasty anyway. Lots of great entertainment music and movies were awesome. Didn't get bored the whole flight. Flight left Auckland 20 minutes late and arrived in Tokyo 20 minutes early! A speedy baggage pickup meant I was able to get an early bus to my home town. Saved me about an hour and a half of waiting. Overall a great experience. Highly recommend Air NZ.

### Air New Zealand customer review
SYD-AKL-NAD-AKL in Jan 2014. All flights on 777-300 with herring pattern arranged “space-seats” in business (and eco+?). All flights on time. Aircraft clean staff neat and all flights on time. Food good. Lounges very good in all three airports visited. Only the lounge staff could improve. On board the planes a similar attitude: FAs appear to be very local somehow managing to disrespect passengers by being by far too familiar and too self- confident doing too much talking for nothing and on the verge of being intrusive. All FAs (except a single one) were clearly ageing over the hill and that shows. Order details were forgotten during the lengthy chat sessions which at times were embarrassing or painful. On the outbound I had 13 hours transit in AKL and no hotel was provided as this was a regular schedule time gap! They also managed not to reload my bag to NAD and it remained in AKL. Arrived 28 hours later to Suva upon filling forms and lots of confusion and phone calls.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Traveled HK-Auckland on 10 Jan 2014. Aircraft was a B777-200. The interior was quite old. Food choices were limited in quantity and since I was sitting at second to last row (64) twice both dinner and breakfast I was left with whatever available and none of them suited me. Air NZ does not provide toothbrush and toothpaste which are available on Cathay Pacific and Singapore long haul flight. In terms of in-flight entertainment movies were out dated. My audio socket was dead on the right output. Air NZ stewards seem to be over casual. The most irritating thing was Air NZ allowed only a single piece check-in baggage where Cathay Pacific and Singapore allow two.

MAN-LHR-LAX. Flew Christmas day from Manchester to LAX via Heathrow using Virgin's 'Little Red' service to Heathrow then onto LA using ANZ's premium economy 'spaceseat' product. Check in at Manchester terminal 3 was quick and painless our bags were checked in by Virgin and went through to LAX even though our main flight was with ANZ. After arriving at Heathrow and checking our gate number it was time to board. I find that ANZ excel in this area in PE. We were boarded as priority passengers right after business class. In their PE cabin its essentially just economy with extra legroom whereas I find ANZ really do differentiate with their premium customers. Onto the plane and as always its spotless I am always impressed at the friendliness of the cabin crew and the spaceseat itself. Yes this seat does not fully recline but this is not a business class cabin and more importantly is not a business class price! After a smooth take off and tasty dinner (both my partner and I opted for the lamb and it was very tasty) it was time for a few glasses of wine before they dimmed the cabin lights. I have seen comments that say drinks can take a while using the touch screen service. I usually just go and get my own drinks in this case the flight attendants are more than happy to let you pick anything you want. So a few glasses of wine later and a decent sleep and the cabin lights are slowly brought back up to full before breakfast is served. Finally we arrive into LAX 30 mins ahead of schedule. Once through immigration our bags are already waiting for us as they are labelled 'priority' and so are one of the first off the conveyor. If you are expecting a business class seat (i.e fully flat) then ANZ's 'space seat' isn't for you however neither is the price. I paid just over $1600 for my return ticket and at that price this flight was an absolute bargain. Compared to anything else that's out there the ANZ's premium economy cabin is head and shoulders above its competition both in terms of the product itself and the quality of its staff. Its just a shame they don't fly to more destinations as I believe the only thing keeping BA in business is their routes it certainly isn't their service based upon my last trip in PE with them. If you are taking the long flight from the UK to LAX and have a few extra dollars to spare then go for this flight it makes an unbearable experience (11 hours in a metal tube) actually pretty fun!

Two trips AKL-CHC-AKL and one AKL-WLG-AKL in the last three weeks. I'm pleased that they've gone back to the Lord of the Rings safety video - grabs your attention much better than any other I've seen in recent years. Information from flight deck good apart from one sector where the First Officer seemed to be whispering. No problems with the flights themselves - my only grizzle is about the automated check-in machines. On two of my Christchurch legs the machine wouldn't print a bag tag so I had to join the long queue to get one from the manned counter. There also seemed to be some in both Auckland and Christchurch that weren't working.

LAX-AKL Premium Economy Spaceseat. Seat large and very comfortable for 6ft 100 kg male. Tilt / recline took a couple of attempts yet once learned quite simple. Loved the no recline from seat in front. Legroom was more than enough. Sat in middle seats with partner more than enough room for a couple. Enjoyed middle armrests as table. Seat most impressive for this class of travel highly recommended. Entertainment system didn't have a large selection of movies although with so many internet/ on demand systems at home these days I am finding this is the case with many airlines. Service fine although nothing special ordered drinks from entertainment screen menu always took a while to arrive. Food was fantastic although dessert is served before main. Avoid seats near toilets as a queue often forms. Overall a fantastic way to fly. Would be great if more airlines offered the spaceseat.

Sydney - Auckland - Queenstown return. Tran Tasman was okay. I know cabin crew seem to have a tough job but at the end of flight was bombarded by crew asking for performance reviews to the cabin manager. Got a tad much after a while. Food pretty poor Auckland - Queenstown return. A small cookie and a tea for a 1 hr 45 min flight. Also in close proximity to screaming toddlers - the cabin crew gave out ear plugs but hey what can you do. Return trip in Premier sort of lacked the "refinement" of say Qantas or Cathay. Sort of too relaxed and friendly. Wouldn't go Business again for that short distance again.

### Air New Zealand customer review
AKL-Nadi. Business Premier. Smart 777-300 felt roomy and the interior modern. It was a short 3 hour flight through to Nadi which I was looking forward too after 2 weeks in NZ. The Lounge was Ok and well serviced but very busy. The Qantas Lounge is a letter better and comfortable. Boarding was smooth and the crew welcomed us by name which is a great touch. Service was professional friendly and somewhat quick to the point of being a little hurried. The NZ wines and meal was excellent. The seat is great especially when I managed to get a 60 min nap in prior to landing. You can't beat the privacy but it comes at a cost of being social when traveling with a partner. I am not sure if this would be my first choice from LAX-AKL as a re-branded south pacific airline was better in the all round. Air NZ is still a great airline product though!

Premium economy LAX to Auckland. The Spaceseat looks impressive but was disappointed to find it quite grubby wet wipes to the rescue sealed travel blanket covered in food bits quickly replaced by staff. I loved the seat quite comfortable taller traveling companion found it very restrictive to finding a comfortable sleeping position. Cabin full but quiet nice staff all helpful. Food was very disappointing fish was just warm not heated properly salad had died many days ago. Dessert served before dinner economy style food with a bit of extra garnish. No tea or coffee after dinner wine service was just a drinks trolley as per economy. Aside from the food all in all more pleasant than economy but IMO lacked the finesse and polish many other premium services offer.

Trans Tasman A320. Economy class. In many ways ANZ are a great airline. But the seating on these aircraft's are the tightest I have encountered. I am an average build male and had to squeeze myself into my seat. If the passenger in front decides to recline their seat be prepared to wear your meal. I have travelled overseas on several 'budget' airlines and have had more room. This configuration is fine for a 40 minute AKL-WLG flight but not for a 4 hour flight with meals.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Travelled business premier class from AKL to Honolulu. Although in row 2 were ignored until last for our meal service. Both times missed out on our choices can easily get over that but the order in which cabin crew served people was a mess made no sense and took forever to complete. Half the time crew didn't know who had served who and on a few occasions drink orders were forgotten and on asking another crew member to follow up they continued to leave it to the original crew member who had long forgotten. The order of service was not front to back back to front or side to side it was completely random. The rest of row 2 had been served even though we frantically tried to get the crews attention. Paid full fare tickets. Felt completely left out and almost felt like the crew were prejudice against us even though they were lovely chatting to us. Very strange and wouldn't put my money back there to risk being mistreated again.

NRT-CHC on 777-200 in premium economy. I knew the product would be inferior to the 777-300 and 747 ones but still it is a relief to have much more legroom and better catering. Check in at NRT was a breeze and the ANA lounge (as I have Air NZ Elite/Star Alliance Gold status) is pleasant quiet and comfortable with an adequate range of snacks and drinks. Boarding was a bit chaotic as the gate area has people scattered standing around making it difficult to get to priority boarding easily. Once on board service was efficient and helpful my Elite status was recognised by getting first requests for all meals for myself and my partner. Dinner was a reasonable fish dish and breakfast was poached eggs which were heated sufficiently and not too much. Wine drinks services always very good. Seats are tired and need replacing. 3-3-3 configuration for premium economy isn't good value for money especially since you lose an inch of seat width as the tray tables fold into the fixed armrests. The seats are quite hard and the leg rest useless for anyone my height or above (I'm 5'10"). Inflight entertainment system had an adequate selection but mine was buggy and needed rebooting. Luggage arrived quickly at Christchurch. Overall reasonable experience as the fare premium over economy was only about 22% but it wouldn't justify full fare.

Flight was delayed due to a mechanical error - perfectly fine with me. The crew were polite and tried to keep us updated while we were in New Zealand. The next flight to Gold Coast was shortly afterwards but due to whatever reasons no one from our flight was able to board this plane even though there were ten seats left. I feel apologetic for those with little ones to look after. We ended up flying on the next flight to Brisbane and expected to be able to coach straight to Coolangatta which the crew had promised. Unfortunately we had to wait an hour for our coach to arrive and by then everyone was shattered. People from our flight had arrived as early as 5am and we were expected to arrive at 9.30am Queensland time. We arrived back around 8pm. Wouldn't fly Air New Zealand again. I wasn't impressed.

Flight Perth - Auckland on 777-200. Very friendly lady at check in asked if I would like an aisle or window. Night flight went for the aisle also put me in a row that had an empty seat next to it. Works ticket very generous food portion including a warmed roll. Very pleased with that added touch. Water runs made quite frequently by the cabin staff. Seat back screens blurry plenty of legroom arrived at Auckland ahead of time everyone was off the plane quickly.

### Air New Zealand customer review
After 17 years of not flying with Air NZ we decided to try again and flew Auckland - Shanghai NZ 289 6th December. The flight was fine. A 4 hour delay before we left Auckland I felt this could have been dealt with a lot more efficiently at Shanghai airport where I had a connecting flight that had just left. First I was told I was to go via Amsterdam to my destination in Zurich then have the flight changed back to my original connecting flight with no directions to the transit desk. Great I thought when the flight was changed back to the original however the very poor English speaker at the transit desk proceeded to give me the wrong time as a consequence I missed my connecting flight. I was finally put on a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt and arrived in Zurich 40 hours after I left home. Added to this my husband and daughter who have travelled separately have had the same delay from Auckland airport. I realize this is a Shanghai airport problem however from what I have since read from other reviewers it is not a one off occurrence. We have the prospect of this all occurring again when we fly back on 11th January 2014. We will go back to flying with either Singapore or Thai.

### Air New Zealand customer review
We were part of the 375 passengers upended by a flawed NZ7 flight from SFO to Auckland on Dec 12th. Scheduled time of departure 7.45pm PDT cancelled due to "refuelling issue" at 11.30pm. All of us were placed into surrounding hotels. Fax at front desk said to report to gate at 11.30am and we would then depart at 1pm and that our flight was now modified to go from SFO to Honolulu then to Nadi Fiji and finally Auckland. We didn't leave at 1 were delayed a few more hours due to "catering loading". Catering was messed up on the flight breakfast served at dinner timtams for breakfast and an attendant crew that was obviously on edge and running out of hours. To say the least any and all connecting flights were also impacted. My flight should have taken 12 hpurs this route took 19. I'm considering alternatives for next time.

Flew Sydney to Auckland in early December on 767. Very comfortable in the 2 seats. Didn't use their TV as had my iPad but crew were some of the best I have encountered. Very helpful friendly and seemed genuinely interested in passenger well being. On the return flight I asked about an upgrade as it was the 777-200 and was offered NZD$495 which I accepted. Lovely lounge in Auckland as you'd expect and great flight back. Very comfortable seat in business with lovely lunch service. Great value and would use again.

### Air New Zealand customer review
MEL-AKL-YVR. The new e-kiosk check in at Melbourne may be cheaper for Air NZ to operate than using human beings but it doesn't help passengers. I had only one bag (I'm allowed up to 3 in Business Class) which was 200g over the 23kg limit. Computer Says No. After moving a couple of items into my hand luggage (which isn't weighed) and some help from a harassed Air NZ human (who secretly admitted that she hates the new check-in system too) my bag was whisked away. An uneventful flight to Auckland then on to Vancouver on an elderly and rather tatty 777-200 followed. Inflight entertainment is adequate but the movie selection is poor with no major new releases available. Service was friendly and unintrusive and the food was OK. I don't expect fine dining on a plane. I have to make this trip fairly frequently and this airline/route is by far the best option but over time I have noticed that Air NZs cost cutting is becoming more obvious and the premium I pay for the Business Class "experience" isn't as worthwhile as it once was.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Appalling service at Sydney airport 12 December 2013 on NZ 104 (Sydney - Auckland). As a monopoly and price gouger Sydney Airport's reputation can't sink any lower but to put a 767 on an outside stand is just daft. Yes one of the planes at the airbridge was undergoing technical maintenance but I cannot believe in this day and age another airbridge was not available. However it was the resulting treatment of passengers that was the concern. A bus to the aircraft in over 30 degree heat - and then left locked in the bus (right alongside the aircraft)  no windows or doors open for fifteen minutes. Most passengers have no seat and the temperatures were rapidly rising. Requests to open doors and windows went unheeded. Apparently the flight attendants had not been informed passengers were on their way. A lack of communication between aircraft and airport - not a good look for an airline at all!

### Air New Zealand customer review
LAX-LHR premium economy on 777-300 with space seats. This is an amazing product. Speedy check-in at separate counters at LAX. Efficient boarding. Seat is amazing - really comfortable with loads of personal space and leg room. Separate cabin makes in feel very business class like. Toilets designed like boutique hotel with library book wall and kept clean throughout the flight. Food top notch and large glasses of wine. Great cabin service. Arrival into LHR ahead of time despite fog and fast delivery of bags. Cannot ask for more. One annoyance - flight attendant had friends in cabin and kept stopping to chat whilst in service.

### Air New Zealand customer review
I flew from Sydney to Auckland on a Boeing 777-200ER in Business Class (seat 3A) and although a quick 3.5 hour flight it was excellent. The seats are roomy (didn't utilize the bed option) for the amount of time in the air service was very personal and professional and the food was great. The Service manager visited each Business Class customer prior to landing and asked if everything was to their liking-rare these days to find that on airlines. Many options with the personal television for movies TV programs and more. First time flying Air New Zealand and I was very impressed.

### Air New Zealand customer review
My 18 year old son has just arrived in Vancouver after flying MEK-AKL-YVR. He is travelling to a skiing camp so had excess and over sized baggage which we had accounted for. Check-in at the at the airport is an e-kiosk with no option to use a counter. This is fine if flying is straight forward and you have one bag. I was most unimpressed and sought assistance from ground staff who were helpful. I noticed older passengers who were struggling and thought about families with young children bags prams and car seats and wonder how one person is to manage. The plane was old and the seat uncomfortable and he was served the identical meal on the Auckland and Vancouver legs. Luckily it was good however being hungry he asked for a second meal and was told he couldn't have one - this is company policy. So he went hungry for a 12 hr flight. This is not acceptable and we will not be flying Air NZ again.

Auckland to Hong Kong on 15 October. So good! The steward was the most helpful I've known the cabin was actually warm (I hate how cold most planes are) the food was fine the movies were a bit out of date but it seems that all the airlines are doing that now.

We flew on November 21st service from Auckland to London via Los Angeles LAX and had a great comfortable flight. They didn't have vegetarian meals on the plane and upon realizing my boyfriend's medical dietary restrictions the nice flight attendant made sure to get him anything he could eat. She was very attentive and sweet and both of us felt well cared for on that very very long flight. She invited me to try my first New Zealand red wine and it was lovely. The boarding process was simple check-in was easy and the in-flight entertainment options were incredible with lots of recent films.

Flying short haul from Christchurch to Auckland it was one of my favourite flights. Staff were friendly and nice. The safety video instruction was the best I'd seen and honestly it was the first time I saw all the passengers paying attention to it. The only thing that I did not like was the food well actually the snack Cookie Times and chips no other choice. I preferred the muffin!

SYD-AKL-YVR-AKL-SYD return agree with majority of comments re checked in baggage allowance + cabin bag allowance (7kg) as last time I flew to North America checked in baggage allowance was 2x 23kg bags. Clean Cabin friendly staff decent inflight catering + AVOD options.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flight from Auckland to Shanghai: Check In: friendly but not very helpful staff when I raised an issue the only answer was: give feedback on our website this is not what you expect as Frequent Flyer and passenger flying in Business Class. Business Class seat: worst seat ever seen on a long-haul flight. The seat is a very old recliner seat even not electronic but manual adjustment of seat position. Very uncomfortable. Food very bad (quality and taste very limited choice). Service: OK but not on Business Class level. Conclusion: NZ is completely overrated they have old aircraft's with old seats and the food and service is far below competitors!

### Air New Zealand customer review
My wife and I just finished a 2.5 week trip to New Zealand. The flight and stewards were excellent however the trouble came when checking in at Auckland airport to come back to LA. We were going through to customs and a lady called us and said we needed to weigh our two carry on bags. Apparently they have to weigh less than 7kg and one bag weighed 9kg and the other was 11kg. My carry on bag itself weighs 3.5kg empty. The lady tells us we have to turn around and go all the way back downstairs to where we checked in. We were already pressed for time and now were in danger of missing our flight. We go back downstairs and there is one lady covering all of the checked bags. We wait in line and she then commences to tell me they have to be below 7kg or it will cost me $200/bag. Also they need to be consistent in this policy. As the lady stopped us before customs to weigh our bag 10 people walked by with bigger bags than mine. I hope they review this policy as they are getting a lot of bad press and a lot of unhappy economy class patrons who last time I checked still represent the majority of seats on the planes!

### Air New Zealand customer review
The flight itself was just the same as any other airline no problem. But what really annoyed me was the treatment I received at check in. We flew from Blenheim to Auckland. A family group of 4 of us checked in. Maybe one case out of the 4 was overweight but they took into account that in total others were lighter and we did not exceed the overall allowance for 4 persons. All good so far. They insisted on weighing my hand luggage which had been stripped down to a few light items but the main content was my CPAP medical machine that deals with my sleep apnea condition a camera tablet and lap top. Overall weight was about 9kgs about 2kgs over the limit of 7kgs. The check in man told me that I was over the limit and would have to remove some items. I pointed out that I had a laptop hoping he would then just let it be. On the flight to Christchurch the Air New Zealand check in told me 9kgs including a laptop was OK and let the bag go. This time the man told me to remove the laptop so he could weigh the bag again. It is an ultra book so extremely light which still made my bag 8kgs. He still wasn't happy and insisted that I remove more items. This was extremely embarrassing for the sake of 1kg but in the end we placed some items in a plastic shopping bag which my wife was allowed to carry on because she only had a handbag. This reduced the weight down to 7kgs which made the check in man happy and I could then put my very light laptop back inside. Rules are rules fair enough but for goodness sake. My wife had next to no hand luggage why couldn't they just aggregate the weight for our group or at least for the 2 of us? In the end I put the items back in my bag anyway but the irony was that it was a small plane and the overhead lockers were too small to even take the regulation hand luggage bag I was using so it had to stay on the floor under the seat in front. So it wasn't as if the bag would have been too heavy for the overhead bin anyway. I expect this kind of treatment from a LCC but not from a full fare carrier like Air New Zealand. It was very embarrassed and it just left a bitter taste for the whole flight. I won't be rushing back to Air NZ I can assure you.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flew MEL-CHC-ZQN-AKL-MEL A320 and ATR72. Legroom on the Trans Tasman flights are a joke in fact the domestic A320 aircraft have more legroom! Movies on the Trans Tasman flights are quite dated and definitely nothing current on show. Catering for those who paid for it was just ok nothing special. Service by crew was ok I missed out on drinks (cabin crew didn't make it to my row) even though I paid for "The Works" fare. This experience certainly does not convince me to fly them long haul I would definitely recommend Qantas on the Trans Tasman flights.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Travelled PER-AKL on Air NZ aircraft was a B777-200. Must admit I was a little disappointed with the level of service which I found to be a bit inconsistent. The cabin manager and a couple of the staff in the business cabin were excellent but were let down by a couple of their colleagues who looked like they were just going through the motions. One of these was an older member of the team who just didn't seem to have the friendly disposition and level of service you would expect when travelling in a premium cabin. The positives were the food and wine which was excellent. The negatives were the bed and the IFE in my seat went unserviceable fortunately there was a vacant seat so I was able to move over to that! When it did work the bed was of a good quality and the IFE had a good screen and wide variety of choice. If they are going to do a personalised service they need to get the persons name right as after I had corrected the flight attendant with my name I was then referred to as someone else later in the flight.

### Air New Zealand customer review
We flew NZ1 LHR-LAX and NZ2 LAX-LHR 777-300. Both flights were typical of ANZ quality and what we've come to expect over the years good food IFE and cabin crew. For the return trip we upgraded to exit row seats 34J & K and found them to be a good investment in terms of the extra cost althoughas others have commented it was a little chilly so use the blankets. Chatting with a member of the crew I was disappointed to learn that the new P.E. seats as fitted in the 777-300 are not to be used in the 787 aircraft because the company that makes them have made it uneconomical for ANZ. I think this is a shame having travelled in them before we found them far better than any other P.E. offering.

### Air New Zealand customer review
777-300. AKL-LHR. The seats are ridiculously cramped they may be OK if you are waif-like but anyone else will struggle I know that airlines cram in economy passengers so they can make money on the premium seats but Air NZ has gone too far. I felt sorry for the crew negotiating the narrow aisles and having to be polite to disgruntled passengers. The in-flight entertainment and meals were of a high standard but that doesn't make up for the physical discomfort. I travel to and from Europe at least once a year and my airline of first choice has always been Air NZ but the experience has got so much worse over the past couple of years that I won't be travelling Air NZ long haul again.

### Air New Zealand customer review
LHR-LAX return. Have to say both flights were the most uncomfortable ever. Very hot on both legs and even the stewardesses were complaining about the heat. Also seating on the 777-300 is very cramped. BA or Virgin next time i think.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Having just returned to the US after visiting New Zealand. I wish to comment on the economy seating on B777-300 compared to the B777-200 AKL-LAX. The seats in the new B777-300 are ridiculously cramped both in width and pitch. I had the fortune to buy the emergency seats on both legs but would have struggled if I had been in normal economy on the B777-300. In addition the extra crammed in seat reduces the aisle width to uncomfortable levels for both sitter and walker. Perhaps you should be calling them Hobbit Seats for Hobbit sized people. Even your steward staff were complaining bitterly about the negative feedback they had received from cramped Kiwis. Did Air New Zealand get any focus groups to try these seat mockups for size or did Air New Zealand marketing people get done over by the people who sold the premium seats? Your superb airline staff cannot overcome the 12 hours of cramped misery that that I heard people complain about.

### Air New Zealand customer review
My wife and I traveled on 2 transpacific flights (ANZ 01 ANZ 06) recently and arrived at LAX 2 days before the Friday Nov 1 bombing. These flights and two others from and to Melbourne were the most comfortable international flights we've ever taken and we started flying internationally in 1968. We'd recommend Air New Zealand. Auckland International Airport was also superb though I speak less enthusiastically about Melbourne. My only negative is why does ANZ continue to use LAX? That airport was a total mess and the pits before the recent shootings. Its (among other US airports - DTW for example) a national disgrace. Can't you fly into something close in LA and skip LAX?

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flew on business class YVR-Auckland-Brisbane-Auckland-YVR on 772ER. Great business class seats. They made up our flat bed like a 5-star hotel maid service! Another plus are each seats are added with memory foam on top of the bed. Food also excellent! One little set back was few attendants were rude but the majority were friendly and courteous. Also flew on Air New Zealand Link flying between Auckland-Blenhiem aircraft's are old and cramped. Did not alter my flight experience because these such a short flights with stopover in Wellington.

Flew SFO to AKL. An absolute nightmare. The plane was full and very cramped. Service was non existent. The staff sat in the galley for nearly the entire time and when I went to get a drink I had to lean over the steward who was reading a newspaper and he sighed loudly because I had disturbed him. No offer of help at all. I ended up pouring drinks for the passengers that where queuing. Toilets were a disgrace and stunk to high heaven. After a year of saving and sacrifice to take this trip it seemed like a huge waste of money. I will never fly long haul with Air NZ again.

BNE-AKL-SFO then LAX-AKL-BNE in Business. 3 legs on 777-300ER and 1 on 747-400. Excellent service on all legs seats comfortable entertainment and food/wine generally of high standard. Lounge in LAX perhaps too small for the number of visitors. Otherwise would recommend highly.

AKL-YVR (Vancouver) - YVR-AKL. We had a good flight both ways. Our flight was on time going to Vancouver and 45 minutes earlier coming back to Auckland. Some cabin crews were friendlier than the others. (They need of a bit of re-training). The food was good as well as the inflight entertainment and seating. Overall we are always satisfied with Air New Zealand!

### Air New Zealand customer review
We travelled NZ1 LHR to AKL on 13 October and had a wonderful flight with great service from a dedicated cabin crew on both legs. Our issue is that a traveller was allowed to fly with bare feet in sandals which he took off on boarding. This is the second time we've encountered this on an Air New Zealand Business class flight I was sitting in 4A and this person was in 5B with his dirty feet on the ottoman in front of my view the whole way. Thankfully he got off in LA. As I said this is the second time this has happened to me and I think it's horrible.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Air NZ has gone downhill lately and is more like a budget airline. Couldn't use the electronic check in kiosk and there was no-one to help. When we finally found someone she was very rude about our baggage told us we couldn't take one bag then just walked off and left us even though we were within the weight limit. Very rude. We would have been allowed a stroller for our baby but not a bag. Infants are allowed a carry on bag (not checked in) but as parents travelling with young children the last thing you need is another bag you have to lug through the airport. The assistant at the bag drop wouldn't help me get our bags on the conveyor even though I was carrying a baby at the time. Another passenger kindly helped instead. There were spare seats on the plane but they don't put them next to the people with kids who could really use them. Meals were tasty but small.

### Air New Zealand customer review
I booked on a flight from Los Angeles to Auckland on a 777-300 premium economy specifically to travel in their 2-2-2 Space Seating on a colleagues recommendation. Air New Zealand changed the aircraft to a 777-200 without any recourse. This aircraft is equipped with the old 3-4-3 economy seat type configuration and just not worth the additional cost especially as I was allocated a middle seat. You may as well travel in economy. Be aware you may book on a 777-300 to secure a space seat in premium economy just to be bumped to a 700-200 economy seat. I will be staying with Emirates or Qantas.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Latest aircraft on a flight from CHCH to AKL NZ 510. Seats do not have any ability to recline backwards (even slightly) leaving tall passengers with a very uncomfortable ride on a brand new aircraft.

Flew from Rarotonga to Auckland to Blenheim pleased on the way to Rarotonga on the B777-200 but the return flight was at midnight so I had to pay another night stay then found that I was flying on an A320 for 4 hours. Auckland to Blenheim on the Q300 better than the Beach 1900D. The cost was crazy to Blenheim but Rarotonga was better. I got free drinks because I had Works Deluxe. Highly suggest the works!

Flew LHR to LAX and SFO-AKL-MEL. The staff on both the long haul legs were friendly and attentive. The PE seats on the 777-300 are far superior to those on the 777-200 but both have heaps of space. The food on all legs was really good and the NZ wines were excellent. I was offered (and accepted) single malt whisky which I thought pretty good. The overall service was far superior to both QF and CX (both of which were in Business Class) on our outward legs from MEL.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Had a great trip MEL-AKL-LAX. The food and service were first class on full planes. This is the best way to judge an airline and New Zealand kept up the service all the way. The planes were all on time and I was impressed with the economy section meals. I needed an aisle seat and the staff went out of their way to get the seat for me. The inflight entertainment was second to none and the planes modern and comfortable.

My flights were from Christchurch to Auckland return. I was reasonably happy with everything except the seating. On both flights I was allocated a middle seat with no choice of changing. The space between the seat rows has been reduced so much my knees are jammed into the seat in front and when the passenger in front also reclined their seat there is no space to move or read. The passengers on either side of my seat both claimed the arm rests and I had to continually jostle for space. On one flight the passenger in front was not asked to put their seat upright before landing. I used to enjoy flying but now dread the thought of it.

I travelled from LHR via LAX to New Zealand on 10 Sep 2013 and returned to LHR the same way on 3 Oct 2013. I cannot praise Air New Zealand's service highly enough. Everything was perfect and in my opinion could not be faulted. A wonderful airline!

### Air New Zealand customer review
AKL-LAX in Economy. Great to finally use the check-in machines at AKL for flights to N. America (now we just need online check-in). Efficient boarding and the dinner service was prompt after take-off which maximises sleep time. Dinner was a nice but salty corned beef. Seat is comfortable crew were professional but rather cold. Breakfast was fine - but I find most airlines breakfasts nasty so this is a plus. It'd be interesting to see what my opinion was if there was any competition on this route for NZ. But for a monopoly the experience was more than good enough.

### Air New Zealand customer review
MEL-AKL Sep 2013 on 777. Business class overall generally what you'd expect but more expensive and not quite the experience of other trans-Tasman options. Herringbone seating comfortable enough but I am not a fan of the angled nature of it; window seats angled into the cabin making looking out of the window difficult. In-flight entertainment food and beverages and service competent but not outstanding. Air NZ lounge in Melbourne nothing to write home about no view other than the underside of docked aircraft and minimal food and drink.

### Air New Zealand customer review
LHR-LAX-AKL-LAX-LHR. First time flying Air NZ and was very impressed with the in-flight experience. Service excellent and lie flat seats on 777 were fabulous. Inflight entertainment has full TV series (not the one-off episodes provided by many other airlines). All in all I would recommend Air NZ. One small complaint is the transit through LAX (and therefore US customs/immigration). Would be improved by transiting through Vancouver or even Mexico City.

Wonderful service accommodation and staff throughout my journey from LAX-AKL. The VIP lounges are excellent and well stocked and the Premier Business class seats are the best lay flat seats I've travelled in. Wonderful meals and wine selections too! Koru Club in AKL is huge and has plenty of room to stretch out and drink/eat.

### Air New Zealand customer review
AKL-LAX-AKL in September. Economy class outward and Business Class inward. My high rating reflects the stellar service and quality of the product in Business class its on a different planet to Economy Class. I snared an exit row seat at a $75 premium on the outward journey. There was plenty of leg room but the width of the seats seems like it is decreasing every time I'm on one of their 777-300's. Luckily I was on good terms with my neighbour. The night time trip down to the toilets is a nightmare having to manoeuvre your way through this obstacle course of legs blankets headphone cables in the aisles. I dread the day when the 747-400s are retired and the 777-300s are the only way to get to the US. Returning home in business class you were in a different world luxury space and privacy is the epitome of what this award winning airline does very well. The only thing that drops this review from a 10 to a 9 was the fiasco at LAX just before the plane departed when the ground crew decided everyone needed to have their cabin baggage weighed. It was a fiasco and yes I agree cabin baggage size and quantity needs to be monitored closely but the manner in which this exercise was performed at the departure gate in particular by one of the two ground staff it really was unprofessional.

We flew economy from Auckland to Perth. Without doubt the worst airline we have flown. Arrived at 4am for our 6am flight and were unable to check in on the self check in machines. We spoke with a member of staff and told them our problem his response was "yep that's cause your flights been cancelled. No further words no help nothing! We hadn't even been contacted. Eventually we managed to get out of him that we to go speak to someone at the customer service desk. The customer service desk then sent us to Qantas as they had booked us on another flight to Perth. Their check-in had already closed we had to head back to customer service who after 20 minutes booked us on a flight at 2pm and gave us a couple of food vouchers. We then went to check in and were told we had to pay for our baggage-the flight cost nearly $700 each so why do I have to then pay $80 for baggage! Also told that if we wanted any food we had to pay for it even though it was included on our journey from Perth. We were extremely angry about the way Air New Zealand staff had treated us and it completely ruined our trip to Perth. I will definitely not book through them again and in future will be going with a decent airline like Qantas who can't do enough for you.

HKG - AKL 17th Sep 2013 Business Class. I was very impressed with this flight. The 777 lie-flat beds are extremely good and they actually make them up like a real bed. Food was excellent and the cabin crew attention was about as good as you could get. I fly NZ - UK return relatively frequently and this is one of the best flight legs I've ever had. I would use this again no hesitation.

AKL-LAX-LHR in premium economy on Boeing 777-300 with the relatively new Spaceseats. I have flown NZ many times in long haul but this was my first trip in the new Spaceseats and I was pleasantly surprised. On the first leg I was in the front row seat 23A (window) and 30E (middle section aisle) and found the seats private comfortable and with a great deal of width that surpasses any other premium economy on the market (this is a 2-2-2 configuration where other airlines have 2-4-2 in this class). The fixed shell seats mean there is no encroachment from any seat in front and the staggered design means the person next to you is not intrusive. The recline is a bid fiddly but once you get used to it is fine with a decent sized pillow blanket and a beanbag for footrest. I found it better to get my cabin bag down after takeoff place it on the floor and put the beanbag on top for a serious leg rest but it was easy to turn to one side resting the head against the shell of the seat and get some sleep. Food and beverage service is very much Business-lite not economy plus with good quality main courses decent drinks service and all at a level that makes you feel it is much more premium than economy. The cabin itself was quiet it helps that all seats except the windows have direct aisle access. Of course it is far removed from Business in that it is not a flat bed and the food/beverage service for that has a bit more choice and other touches but it is a world away from being crammed together like cattle in economy class. All in all it made this ultra long haul route tolerable and reasonably pleasant (with a decent although not outstanding inflight entertainment system let down by fewer choices than there once were on NZ). It shows other airlines what premium economy can be like although I'll admit the fare reflected this.

Travelled AKL-PPT on B767-300 and PPT-AKL on B747-400. Awarded recognition upgrades to business class in both directions so for us it was great value. Seating on the B747 very comfortable in the herringbone configuration. Standard recliner seats with 2x2x2 layout on B767 is ok for 5 hours but seats are too narrow. Excellent cabin crew and service as always but catering appears to have dropped of recently. Always a great selection of beverages but food offerings just average lately. Entertainment options also not that great with limited new release films. Contract lounge in Papeete is pathetic and almost not worth the effort. Still our preferred airline as great crew compensate for the other shortcomings. Will be glad to see the B767 retired when the B787 comes into the fleet. Will be travelling to LAX next year on B777-300 and will be interested to see if catering is any better.

Used Air New Zealand from Honolulu to Auckland then Auckland to Cairns Aug 23 and Aug 24 and Cairns to Auckland and Auckland to Los Angeles Aug 30. Had a very good impression of the company until the last leg of the trip from Auckland to LA when we were informed that 2 of our 3 confirmed seats were given to other passengers. At first the ANZ associate didn't mind separating our family eventually accommodated us together in another row. Uuncertain if we would fly ANZ again.

### Air New Zealand customer review
MEL-AKL-NSN-AKL-MEL August 2013. Trans-Tasman seats A330 far too tightly spaced eating meal is an uncomfortable process cabin service and food offered both OK. Control over cabin baggage size and quantity on return flight was hopeless with many passengers highly irritated by inability to find space. Self check-in and baggage deposit an affront. Will I be required to clean my cabin area next? Domestic flights OK. I will be back to Emirates for Trans-Tasman.

Flew premium economy from Auckland to LAX. Premium check in nice but no lounge access of course maybe that could be an extra purchase option? Anyway the seat was roomy and way better than any economy seat I've had. They sit at a funny angle and while comfortable it seemed a bit odd. Food and drink was good cabin service very good and having flown business class few times with them its close to what the Bus class gets in that regard. Overall I think its great value for money given what you get.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Business class Auckland to LAX twice in the last 3 months also once in Premium economy. Flight time of 12-13 hours is not bad for such a long haul across the pacific. Cabin crew are generally very good have struck few that seem pre occupied but overall they are very good. The lay flat beds are great. The fare seems to jump around a fair bit and can vary by up to $1000 for each one way leg. The 777-300 is well kept and tidy. The cabin lights at night are a pain they are yellow and bit too bright. I always get the centre row as it quieter. Food fine for business class. Snack bar available during the night. The inflight entertainment can be bit limited but generally enough to fill in the flight. Having done the trip a number times with different airlines in my opinion its one of the best airlines for the trip taking into account service equipment and ticket cost. The real winner is the lay flat beds with doona and mattress. Only really negative aspect is the long connection times to Australia and the Auckland lounge is a bit tired and limited in what food they offer.

### Air New Zealand customer review
We flew business class from Perth to Auckland 18 July 2013. We were very disappointed to discover that they had changed the plane and that the promised lie-flat seats were not available on the plane. It was just the standard business class recliners. We were offered a partial refund but I just didn't think that was good enough. We specifically booked lie-flat because it was an overnight flight - if we had known that could not be delivered we would have chosen a different airline. I just don't think it's acceptable to do the bait and switch when a customer pays top dollar for a premium service.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Our plane from Sydney was diverted due to fog from landing at Christchurch to land in Auckland where we landed approx 1.30am. All good re flight but Air NZ customer service certainly slipped once they had this unexpected event on their hands. We were placed in an excellent hotel but the information we were given by staff when we landed and by staff at the airport the next day was all different and mostly incorrect. My comment to those reading this if something goes wrong with your flight with Air NZ don't ring (you wont be answered for a long time) go straight to the person in charge at the information desk as soon as possible get the information and don't listen to any other staff!

### Air New Zealand customer review
AKL-SYD-AKL twice in the same month. 3/4 flights were A320s - commuter workhorse flights that for a 3.5 hour trans-Tasman flight are fine. Seats are a bit narrow and the pitch is too. IFE continues to lag behind global standards--unresponsive/slow system. Meals were good (I was on Works which includes meal seat bag) when I went for the full meal deal. Cabin crew are a different story. These are disproportionately young (based on the equipment they're recent hires) with good intentions but not quite there. On one flight a passenger dumped his entire scotch and coke on me and the FA was too "chilled" in getting something to clean it up. Reeking of booze was not how I intended to arrive at my destination. Only an hour later I was offered a complimentary drink for my troubles. On another journey my seat light didn't work; the row in front had no IFE. We were all moved to new seats and required to move back for landing. I understand the thinking behind this protocol but really: 1 row won't make a difference for load and it wouldn't be to hard to ascertain who had moved when it's because the airline's equipment has failed.

My family and I flew Air New Zealand from Los Angeles CA to and from Rarotonga Cook Islands. The plane was a spacious B767 and the flight was overall "lovely". The 9 plus hours were made bearable by the service friendly staff and great airplane. Everything worked well (screens etc) and the attendants even came by in the middle of the night offering water to awake passengers. Definitely a "do again" airline for us!

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flew from Auckland to Shanghai (and a connection from Wellington to Auckland). I had originally booked a return flight from London Heathrow to Auckland via Hong Kong but Air NZ axed their LHR-HKG route before I returned. They were not able to book me onto a flight to Hong Kong and so booked me to Shanghai instead and then onwards from Shanghai to London with Virgin Atlantic - meaning I had to scrap my planned holiday trip to Hong Kong and fly straight home - for which I also had to pay extra for even though they caused the route change. Having found previous long haul and Trans Tasman flights with Air New Zealand to be great I was extremely disappointed by this flight. The plane itself seemed very old and was not to clean boarding was very rushed felt like cattle being herded on board (the same leaving the plane too.) The flight was delayed on the tarmac for an hour and this was poorly dealt with by staff. Seating was extremely uncomfortable and I was not able to sleep at all for the 13hr duration and in flight entertainment was mediocre. Food was quite good however there was a complete lack of customer service from the crew except 1 or 2 members. They did not seemed bothered at all with passengers and were not too friendly. Very poor service and will not be travelling with Air New Zealand again on long haul from Europe to NZ.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Los Angeles to Auckland. Our return flight was from Auckland to San Francisco. We have always liked ANZ! On our flight to Auckland we were on the 777-300ER in seats 23A/B. This was our first experience with the newer premium economy service. By all counts it was excellent and would definitely use this class of service again! The seats were comfortable the service and meals were excellent too! On our return flight we flew on the 747 in premium economy - older style - seats 22 H/K. We enjoy the fact that these seats are on the upper level of the 747. These seats are more like standard seats and not as comfortable as the 777 seats. We had room to spread out with no seats directly in front of us. Unfortunately the service was poor during this flight. The FA mentioned that they were missing a staff member for this flight. No matter we still favor ANZ and we would select and recommend the premium economy seats of 777 over the 747 if at all possible.

### Air New Zealand customer review
MEL-AKL-LAX return. Had been looking forward to trying ANZ PY and I was somewhat disappointed. The good things: Superb food better than C on QF oodles of room in the seats great cabin crew on all sectors priority boarding. However seats are uncomfortable. I appreciate the unique design but you just can't get into a good position. They are leather but in my opinion the padding is far too thin and the only way to sleep is to put the seat at full tilt pile up the bean bag with a cushion and lay out straight. Seeing the space the seats take up I'm not surprised ANZ are not going to continue them into new aircraft - they must lose money on them even at a premium fare. The design is also clunky in that nothing works smoothly - you need to force up the armrests and the seat belt is a pain. It has an airbag but it rests uncomfortably on your side. A great idea in theory - but not so good in practice.

NZ176 PER-AKL. Wasn't planning on flying into NZ with ANZ but missed connections meant we were put on this flight. Staff very friendly and helpful. Food very nice especially dessert. Didn't put seat into bed mode when offered (stewards help change it from seat to bed) but just reclined it as far as it would go. Liked how table didn't come out of seat (for a change!) and was a fairly decent size too.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flew LAX to Auckland. Koru staff in LAX were excellent during a long layover they went out of there way to make sure our family of 4 (2 adults 20 month old and 4 yr old were) were ok and when it came to board allowed us to carry sleeping children onto the plane while one of their front line staff followed with cabin luggage. Koru Club is great value for $. The flight itself was good with excellent service and meals. Only criticisms are leg room in economy gets less with every new model of plane (where will it end) and the cabin temperature (as per previous long haul flights) was freezing (lot of passengers commenting on it).

### Air New Zealand customer review
LAX to LHR on 27 July back 1 August. Would be a fine airline but with one profound exception. There is no air- flow in the cabin. Flight attendant she said they had no control over the air circulation only over the temperature. On some 777's one does have access to an air nozzle to supply flow to oneself on most however it is indeed controlled by the airline. Flat bed in business is comic but entertaining in its own way. No instruction manual comes with the seat so it is sort of 'figure it out for yourself'. To get the dining table to emerge (it is at foot level to the right) you have to reach over your left shoulder to a button which you push which then releases the table. You then have to tug at knee level the large table up and out and okay all is fine. By the way they are not seats but more like a bed that can be shot up into some sort of seating position. Not comfortable to sit in. However once you get this seat to go flat and once you have put the several inch thick mattress pads on the seat you have a fantastic bed. I am one of those 4 million mile flyers and not given to complaint. I have never flown ANZ before and will not again until they sort out the basics. That said the enthusiasm of the Kiwis on board the joy of families going for the 'long haul' and the no fuss upbeat nature of the crew is wonderful.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Auckland to Los Angeles on NZ 6 777 (300) in premium economy. Heard lots of different feedback from these new seats and I can honestly say they are heaps better than anything else out there loads of leg room (I am over 6 ft) plenty of space around you and cubby holes to put your bits and pieces away. Food is up to business class standard and staff are very attentive. Inflight snack service (via your entertainment screen) is pretty awful not much choice I think a chocolate bar packet of chips or a cookie was available. All in all a very good product.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Los Angeles to Auckland on NZ 1 in 777 (300) economy class. The only way I can describe an airline that insists on having 10 abreast seating on a 777 aircraft is pure greed honestly it just does not work you are so tightly packed and penned in it is just not funny. No matter how many pillows you tuck under and around yourself you just can't get into a comfortable position. As for trying to watch the inflight entertainment my only bit of advise is watch as much of it as you can before the meal service has ended because as soon as that seat reclines in front the screen will be a couple of inches away from your face. On a positive note no real queues for the toilet because so many people are trapped in their seat. I did find the staff excellent especially towards the kids and the food was really quite yummy and enough to keep you full for such a long flight. Do not have too many expectations on the inflight snack service all that was on offer was a packet of chips or a cookie. Next time it will be a lot longer flight and trip but I am sure it will be a much more pleasant trip on Virgin Australia.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Long haul flight from Hong Kong to New Zealand. Food was great with variety and fresh except for the continental breakfast which had awkward scrambled eggs and meat. On the return trip though I had ordered a nice and delicate cereal breakfast which was a nice start to my day served with fresh fruit milk and yoghurt. Seat was comfortable with a smart headrest. However having tried my friend's seat in the centre of the aircraft I found the leg space to be much limited if a bag was to be stowed under the seat in front. Other than that seats on the sides were more spacious. Check-in was smooth with friendly staff on both airports. And I also appreciated the snacks served on my flight from Auckland to Christchurch which was a short one.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flew from Wellington to Nadi on 13 July. Paid for 4 premium seats including "the works" meal option. We were very disappointed in the food as they offered only one choice of meal as they ran out of the chicken by the time they came to our seats (seated in rows 19). My children were looking forward to the chicken option but were offered only cooked Salmon. I question what proportion of people on a flight actually eat salmon. I think the menu designer made a big mistake. So out of 3 of us only one had a meal.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Overnight flight NZ2 from LAX to LHR on 22 July 2013. Sat in row 36. On entering the cabin the temperature was cool and soon after takeoff the temperature dropped to "icy". Other passengers were clearly noticing the same because there was a large request for blankets. I asked the service people to raise temperature they promised to do it but nothing happened except for some more blankets they gave to us. After one hour I complained again somewhat upset and everybody around could here it. The service staff did not seem to care much about it. They just promised to set the temperature higher but without any noticeable effect. When I was walking through the plane to warm up myself I felt noticeable temp differences between the front middle and rear seat rows. It seems that air conditioning on that Boeing 777 was working pretty unequally. In the end I could not sleep because of anger and dissatisfaction. Icy cold air seems to be a general problem nowadays I have similar experience with NZ night flights from Hong Kong to Auckland and from there to Tahiti. Food was ok. My personal conclusion is to avoid long distance travelling at all in the future.

### Air New Zealand customer review
I had a negative experience recently on a San Francisco to Auckland flight. Started with a rude older staff member at check in snapping that I had to pay $150 for my extra bag. I was then told to calm down after asking for some more wine (had had 4 half glasses) sitting quietly in my seat. I was being very quiet and minding my own business. The women staff were fine but the guys were like school teachers and I was made to feel like a child after this. Unfortunately my national carrier and would like to support them but I don't have any concerns with their safety however and the food was good.

Travelled from SYD to AKL and back. Outbound on a new 320 aircraft with AVOD. TV programmes free but pay for movies. To order from bar you used remote handset and swiped you card.

However very confusing on board service so know your ticket fare class as some get full meal service others only tea/coffee or water.

### Air New Zealand customer review
My family and I were a group of 6 who flew from Perth - Auckland - Honolulu return Business class. Perth - Auckland was quite good long transit in Auckland but Koru lounge very good indeed. Auckland - Honolulu appalling. Very tired worn out B767 with the worst Business Class seats we have ever experienced. Service was mediocre. Same for return Honolulu- Auckland. Lounge in Honolulu nothing short of disgraceful and check in staff rude. Very long 9 hr transit Auckland lounge very good. Auckland - Perth promised to be good until Business class was filled with staff travelling on highly discounted fares. Most of them were quite scruffy and untidy. Worst of all the cabin service started at the rear and by the time they got to us in the front and travelling staff all got fed there was not much of a choice left for us full fare Pax. in the forward rows. Cabin staff should have offered full fare Pax first choice It is totally out of the question us ever flying on their old B767 again as it was the worst ever Business class travel we have had and on the B777 cabin staff need to look after full fare Pax much better than we experienced. Overall maybe 4/10 and that's only for the B777 for the B767 flights 1/10.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Upgraded to Business due to Air NZ changing planes with no PE. Definitely better than Premium economy having flown both. On the negative side if you had booked Business Class and paid the full price you would have been disappointed with the recliner seats. As a traveller on Business Class you would probably expect the flat bed product for any flights over 5 hours especially if overnight. I would say the seats were comfortable and are fine for a 5 hour flight. Not sure why some people have said they are worse than economy. Overall a great experience . Staff were fantastic and I can't wait to use Air NZ again.

### Air New Zealand customer review
First time in Premium Economy (Hong Kong to Auckland). Great legroom and seat recline but seating configuration same as economy 3x3x3 so very cramped and narrow. Entertainment console in side of seat so every time you moved even a little bit you'd knock yourself off whatever you were watching. I was stuck in a middle seat so no room for sleeping at all you had to sit stick straight otherwise you'd touch those next to you very uncomfortable. Food was excellent best airline food I've ever had 2 course meals with nice china etc basically business class quality. Little night time pack of eye mask etc a nice bonus too.

### Air New Zealand customer review
We have flown with over 30 airlines and Air New Zealand in our opinion is the best in all classes. We travel round the world 2 or 3 times a year and closer to NZ more frequently and where possible will fly Air N Z. Ground staff occasionally let the otherwise excellent service down (mainly in NZ funnily enough)! But the planes and flight crews are above and beyond complaint. Premium economy on the 777-300 is a new experience. 2-2-2 seating and space. Plenty of room to store items good lighting thick foot cushion great AVOD choices and delicious food and beverages. Baggage delivery was very quick. Business seating is mostly on angled seating which converts to full lie flat beds.

Honolulu to Auckland - very cramped seating - we are both tall - bit annoyed that there were empty rows with one person there yet others were cramped. Felt like a wreck when we landed after a brilliant holiday. Air New Zealand used to be a really good airline now it feels cheap. Next time I will choose a different airline. Food was awful entertainment poor.

AKL-YVR 19 June. Whilst queued for check-in the computers crashed: allowing online check-in would have made everyone's lives better - but things like this happen. Was called to the gate for "immediate boarding" only to wait 20 more minutes to begin boarding. Flight left 20 minutes late but still arrived in Vancouver a few minutes early. Flight attendants usual professional polite not over-friendly NZ ones. Meal was a tasty corned beef for dinner and I had the continental breakfast shortly before arrival. Seat was fine for someone small like me (167m) but when one person reclines everyone needs to because of the pitch. Hit bad turbulence and the overhead bin above my head kept popping open. Slept well and arrived refreshed.

WLG-HLZ. Initial flight was cancelled received a phone call to advise of new flight details. Arrived at WLG to find that the new flight was delayed 20 minutes this increased to 1 hour. There is no web check in which is unbelievable for this day and age and the self-check-in at the airport simply said "we cannot check you in please see a representative". The queue for the manual check-in counter was huge at least 20 people waiting for the one single person manning the desks. In addition there were no empty seats within several minutes' walk of the departure gate and I was not given the particular seat on the plane I chose online. Awful - next time I'll drive.

Flights left on time and check in quick and with a smile. Well done Air New Zealand. Will recommend.

15th May LAX-AKL. I have been flying for many years and to this date Air New Zealand is by far the best Airline I have flown with. I have nothing to complain about. The staff were exceptional! Comfy seat with foot rest makes a lot of difference. Very generous inflight entertainment good food and very clean bathrooms. Unfortunately on my return from NZ I had to fly with United who are affiliated with Air New Zealand. Flying with United was very uncomfortable. There is no comparison at all.

MEL-WLG. A320. Very little personal space on board. You actually start to pray that the person in front of you doesn't recline their seat. You try to eat your meal and even lifting your hand to your mouth feels like a mission. Not impressed with this at all. This airline is starting to forget about what made them successful - good service good facilities and loyal customers. After 20 years of flying with them I've had enough and will now use other airlines for across the tasman.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Flew Air New Zealand from Sydney to the US (in to LAX and out from SFO). I must compliment Air NZ on very friendly staff. Ground crew are a little inefficient but cabin crew are excellent. You do need to look at your code share partners though because they are nowhere near your standards. The Air NZ premium economy seats on the LA flights are a dream. Even their normal premium economy is a definite step up from economy (and not just a cm of extra leg room). I highly recommend Air NZ for anyone who desires customer satisfaction as part of their flying experience.

### Air New Zealand customer review
I flew Auckland - LAX on 6 May and return 26 May. First flight was on 777-200 which was looking pretty tired but that's about the only criticism I have. Service food entertainment crew and seats in business premier all to a very high standard. Return leg was on a 777-300 and although similar had a much fresher cabin a bigger touch screen TV and a really good thick mattress which they put over the bed plus two decent sized pillows. As seats they are nothing special with very limited settings but as a bed they are superb - fully flat plenty long enough and much wider across the shoulder which makes a huge difference compared to say Qantas where you feel you are in a slim fit coffin with not enough room to turn over. Crew were friendly and professional on both flights very generous with beverages and food of a very good quality not a huge selection but that's a minor gripe.

Again the A320 is cramped and you hope that the person in front of you doesn't put their seat back into the little space you have. Ok for a short over the Tasman Sea.

Have flown this route numerous times this year and Air New Zealand deliver each time.

For a very comfortable flight across the pacific at a competitive price ANZ deliver.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Auckland to London via San Francisco and at the Auckland check-in they initially charged me 400$ for two extra bags definitely higher than other companies. Furthermore before going through the security they checked the carry on luggage weight so I had to go back to the check-in and pay 250$ for 7Kg excess of my trolley. In total they charged us 650$ (ridiculous). Staff at Auckland check-in were completely unqualified because they did not know how to deal with extra bags and they took the original copy of the excess baggage charges so at San Francisco airport British airways charged us other 250$.

After booking a flight from Christchurch to London via Hong Kong last year and being a long term Koru member we received what I can only describe as very 3rd class attention. Our flight from Hong Kong to London was cancelled after ANZ dropped this route as being unprofitable prior to March this year (travelled in May). We had to make other arrangements as LA was not an option for us. The alternative offered was Cathay Pacific who provided a truly super service. However one of the reasons my wife and I choose ANZ internationally was to be able to use the lounge facilities in Hong Kong going out and in London Heathrow and Hong Kong returning. It just makes the 22 hour flight more bearable. However during the dropping of the London - Hong Kong sector ANZ have made no alternative lounge facilities through any other airline and the code share at Hong Kong does not allow a guest since March this year. I understand the need to rationalise flight sectors but the poor way ANZ staff handled the change in my case is very disappointing and not worthy of a so called 4 star airline. Our Next international flights will be with another carrier some who offer complimentary lounge facilities and a genuine customer care attitude as a given.

We travelled on a 767 from Auckland to Shanghai last week business class. The seats were uncomfortable if the seats were fully reclined in front. I had to climb over the next seat to get out surely this is unsafe. This is a 12 hour flight with very poor meals certainly worse than economy in fact a fellow passenger although business class elected to travel economy because he had experience of this before and stated it was far more comfortable. The seats were very uncomfortable service poor entertainment nearly non existent. We originally booked through Virgin Atlantic and your airline was code sharing what an insult to Virgin Atlantic. Their service and comfort was far superior on the second flight. I felt paying for business class for this substandard service was a complete "rip off" I certainly will never travel with Air New Zealand again and will advise others of this. I am well travelled and this is the worst flying experience ever.

A very disappointing experience AKL-SFO. At check in they tried to seat our party of two in different rows (eventually rectified). Got onboard the ancient 747 to find that half the archaic IFE (which had very limited options as it was) wasn't working so they had to reboot system (a long drawn out procedure). Slow disorganised service from the crew - very mixed bag with some putting in the effort and others completely uninterested and even rude at times when requesting things such as tissues. Disgusting meal (first choice ran out in 7 rows) and missed for drink services twice by the Flight Services Manager! All in all big let down and would reconsider paying the premium to fly on Air New Zealand for these long flights again.

Checked in at 8am for NZ135 to Brisbane used Air NZ Premium Check-in area then self service terminal and dropped bags off all done in 5 mins used private lift to Customs and security area through very quickly! Entered a very busy Air NZ Lounge for B/fast and coffee standard cold breakfast items but disappointed in hot food items. As we entered the gate area the flight had started to board only 1 other going through priority boarding so very quick to board shown to our seat jackets taken newspapers offered also Champagne fresh orange juice and water. Departed on time. Flight supervisor introduced himself to every passenger! Menu's handed out To start Fruit Smoothie or Fresh Juice selection of cereals fresh fruit and yoghurts then offered croissants Danish selection and toast with fruit Conserve. For the hot option I had the scrambled eggs and they were excellent I especially loved the mushroom ragout! To finish Coffee/Tea selection and hot Chocolate. Leather Seat is very comfortable and although for a short 3 hr flight. 10.4" personal Screen with everything you would need! Landed on time crew were very friendly and efficient. All passengers were held back until Business class had all left Brisbane customs not busy at all and went through very quickly leaving airport all in around 25 minutes!

SYD-AKL-LAX. Smooth flight from Sydney to Auckland. The flight was a little delayed in boarding at Sydney because the plane arrived late but still managed to keep me on schedule for my flight to LAX as I had a decent layover. Lunch served from SYD-AKL was actually pretty good and quite tasty for airplane food. Dinner served from AKL-LAX was not so good and took forever because I was at the very back of the plane. The service was ok but not amazing and some of the flight attendants were a bit cold. When boarding the plane I had no one on hand to assist me in storing my bag in the overhead compartment and I could have done with the assistance as I'm only 5'2". In-flight entertainment was good and had a large selection. Seating was comfy and had ample leg room. Overall I wouldn't mind flying with them again.

AKL to HKG. 772. Midnight flight. Very strange that all cabin crews in economy class were all Asian males. Services were good nice and friendly. After the meal went straight to sleep. Have to say the seat was not bad at all. Managed to get some sleep. Landing was super.

Sydney to Auckland in Business. We had originally booked 'The Works' for the short hop over the Tasman but were offered 'One Up" to bid on an upgrade to Business Class. Our offer was accepted. This was the first time on Air New Zealand and we were suitably impressed with the service food and beverage offers. We didn't take advantage of lying on the lie flat beds as it was a day flight. The safety video was entertaining and we could see that many passengers watched it unlike on other airlines where they are ignored. The flight departed and arrived on time. The only criticism was boarding at Sydney. The departure lounge was packed and was adjacent to an A-380 flight departure. We had been in the ANZ lounge and on arrival at the gate (30 minutes before departure) the flight was already boarding and there was no visible Business Class priority lane. Boarding for all passengers appeared to be a bit of a dog's breakfast.

First time with Air New Zealand on a short hop from Wellington to Auckland. Old B733 but well maintained and with comfortable seating. Loved the safety video. Smart looking crew very efficiently managed to serve a drink (coffee tea water) and a snack during this short domestic flight. Ground staff made me check-in my carry-on as it was 1 kg over the weight limit. Wish they would enforce this with all travellers as other passengers brought large pieces of luggage on board. Flight about double the price than Jetstar on same route and as a QF Platinum will give my business to Jetstar in the future. This one time NZ booking was done due to flight times as I needed to catch an international flight from Auckland.

Flew to London from Los Angeles round-trip on Air New Zealand and it was a wonderful experience. The attendants kept us fed and hydrated there was plenty to do on the in flight entertainment console I was reasonably comfortable in coach. I'd happily fly with them again.

We travelled on flight 136 Wednesday 15 May BNE-AKL. We sat in row 55. On entering the cabin the temperature was cool and not long after takeoff the temperature dropped to 'very cold'. Other passengers were clearly noticing the same because there was a large request for blankets. On asking the flight attendant if the cabin temp could be turned up we were told "yes when we get down the back of the plane after serving the meals. We know its cold because everyone else has already told us". An hour and a half later it was still freezing. It only began to warm up half an hour out of Auckland. We have constantly supported AirNZ however this would be the worst flight we have had with the airline. One of our inflight entertainment screens wouldn't work and no headset was left at that seat. The cost of our seats covered the meal baggage and inflight entertainment.

Sydney-Auckland-Christchurch on 777-200 Business Premier and A320 on domestic leg. Lounge in Sydney very busy but as usual good selection off food and drink. Priority boarding was fast and efficient; Flight was excellent with great service from the crew. Have done Tasman sector a few times and food is the same great selection of high quality NZ wines. The 777-200 was showing signs of wear and tear. Staff service was friendly and was a great flight from Sydney. Auckland to Sydney was on a Tasman configured A320 lounge in Auckland was good with a good selection of breakfast and coffee from their Barista services. Flight was quick and was impressed that one crew member had remembered me from previous flights. Onetime and excellent service.

We booked a "flexi-plus" internal flight AKL-CHC with ANZ. Our international Emirates flight was late so we phoned from Sydney to say that we would miss it and would take a later flight. Although we had flexi-plus tickets "no service fees or fare difference will apply to flight changes made at the airport on the day of departure where changing to an earlier or later flight departing that day" they insisted we pay another £250.

I have flown with Air New Zealand for several years and have always found their service wonderful. That was not the case with my last flight to Hawaii. I felt like a number and some people received food and some did not. In my case my husband did and I didn't because of a new system of paying for food and even a drink of juice. For an international flight I think this is a terrible system which lead to a great deal of confusion and uncomfortableness for both the passengers and the flight crew. The different food services caused me to feel uncared for and undervalued as a customer.

Flew Wellington-San Francisco (via Auckland). Bought the upgrade to premium economy and it was well worth it. The personal and friendly service was the best we have experienced. Cabin was immaculate everything worked the seats were comfortable and reasonably new.

Flew from Shanghai to Auckland and then onwards to Wellington. Staff were extremely friendly and the food was lovely particularly compared with the Virgin food we had on the leg from Heathrow. All the fittings worked and were in good condition the leg room was fine (I'm 1.84m tall).

Flew Premium Economy from LAX to AKL on a 777-200. Despite not having the new seats that are on the 777-300 the leg room was amazing and the food great. Recommended for comfort without the high cost of Business class.

### Air New Zealand customer review
Leg room on Internal flights is getting smaller and smaller. Being 6ft 2 inches or 1.88 mtrs it's a real squeeze to get into the seat. I feel sorry for anyone taller than me. Stop treating passengers like sardines. The trip I did was Auckland to Dunedin return. Both on an A380 and a Boeing.

Adelaide to Auckland April 28 2013. Usual incredibly strict control of baggage weight both hold and hand. Sure there need to be some controls but the pettiness of Air NZ on even one kilo over is incredibly frustrating especially after travelling long haul with a greater allowance. Given this is a one class only route there really ought to be better facilities and service. Food on board fine; service OK and typically informal/casual kiwi style including the Purser starting her announcement with "hello lovely people". Can't quite imagine that from one of the BA matrons!

B747-400 Premium Economy SFO-AKL B767 Works AKL-SYD. Pretty disappointed with the NZ service offering. Old Premium Economy seat had lots of recline but the legrest didn't extend upwards enough so it was essentially useless. Entertainment had a decent selection but the system was slow and not very responsive. Food was fine although some passengers were served using porcelain mugs while others given paper cups for drinks service which was odd. Inflight service was very inconsistent some smiling while others looked like they wanted to be elsewhere. Definitely not worth it if you paid full fare for Premium Economy. B767 was old although updated with AVOD. Breakfast was basic either continental or hot.

### Air New Zealand customer review
I have been flying with Air New Zealand since 2007 primarily Premier Economy or Business. The tickets are corporate and were not bought by me. The routes flown have been both via Hong Kong and Los Angeles. Had I been given the choice I would not have flown with this airline. In general the cabin staff have been friendly and efficient but inconsistent in their service delivery. Some teams have decided to deliver the bistro experience; others have gone along with the norm. On one occasion I witnessed one of the flight deck crew talking to a passenger who was concerned about something on the aircraft. Instead of reassuring the passenger he began shouting and threatened to call security to lift the passenger from the flight. Instead of defusing the situation he drew attention to the situation causing the passenger and his family to be acutely embarrassed. Joining their loyalty scheme through Star Alliance is pointless as the Air NZ routes have become limited as they no longer go via Honk Kong. In addition although I qualified as a Gold Member this was not updated on their system and I couldn’t use their lounges or associated benefits. However the card had been issued and was at home waiting for me. A colleague has had similar experiences and written to Air NZ to complain. More than a month late he still has had the courtesy of a reply. You could put all this down to the Kiwi independence and a refusal to be subservient. However they are in the service industry and if they can’t handle it then they shouldn’t have joined. If you do travel with them you’re unlikely to suffer unduly and you shouldn’t let these things colour you impression of New Zealand.

We were also in the flight reviewed by D Snyder on 4 March 2013. We suffered over 12 hours of misery being confined in a cabin in suffocating heat - the cabin crew told us it was 28/29 degrees as the air conditioning was not working - a fault which was known about a long time before takeoff. Whilst our cabin staff worked hard the flight deck were indifferent with not even the courtesy of a visit to see how bad the conditions were. We understand others like us complained to Air NZ but we did not get a reply for almost 6 weeks. This reply was wrong saying that we were offered iced towels and the opportunity to move to cooler areas of the aircraft - neither of which happened.
