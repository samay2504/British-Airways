### "staff friendly and hospitable"
Nauru to Brisbane via Honiara. I have flown with Nauru Airlines numerous times. They are one of the best international airlines I have flown with Qantas, Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Malaysian etc. The cabin staff were very friendly and hospitable. Ground staff are polite and efficient. Nauru Airlines. Cabin staff kept serving drinks time to time. My special meal requests had been fulfilled and the meals were delicious. Seats had decent leg room. Toilets were clean. Had a smooth take off and landing.

### "charming cabin crew"
Nauru to Pohnpei. Small but friendly airline. The seat configuration was 3+3 and the legroom was OK for my 6ft frame. No real in-flight entertainment. On the relatively short-haul island hopping, only snacks were served but there was beer and wine. The best feature of this airline were the charming cabin crew, clad in blue and I thought of them as Angels in Blue.
