### "dragging their feet on refunding"
Not Verified |  Purchased a book of 10 flight vouchers for the Phoenix to Show Low route in December 2021. Boutique dropped this route in July 2022 and are dragging their feet on refunding my 7 unused vouchers. Have spoken with customer service twice in July and September and been told they would be refunded but as of October they have not.

### "Definitely recommend"
I was a little nervous to fly after reading some of these reviews but my ticket was already purchased so I went for it! Best flying experience I've ever experienced. Both the Pendleton airport and Portland airport were easy to find and they both weren't in the major airports so didn't have to deal with TSA or people. Check in was simple and from check in to boarding was quick. Take off and landing for both flights were great, best I've experienced and little to no turbulence! Im wondering if the negative reviews were for flights taken during the months with crazy weather which would make sense as to why it would be scary so I'll probably stick to boutique air during the months with good weather! My flight home got delayed a couple hours but it honestly wasnt a big deal and they called and texted hours prior to inform me! Overall, best experience and I'll definitely be utilizing boutique air more! Definitely recommend

### "an awful experience"
Cortez to Denver. My flight was cancelled 26 hours ago. There was no customer service available at the gate, as of 26 hours later, no one answers their phone number or my emails nor returns any of my messages. I was unable to rebook my flight, take my trip or even speak with anyone. And, they still have my money. This is an awful experience.

### "I need my luggage"
I paid for a flight from Atlanta GA to Carlsbad NM. When I arrived at Boutique Air they said they didn't have time to get my luggage from American Airlines. The man at the front desk did not offer solutions he just barked statements about how I wasn't getting my luggage because they aren't flying to NM again until Sunday and there "won't be room" for our checked luggage. When my husband called American Airlines they show that Boutique Air signed for my luggage at 2.02pm so that man at the desk lied to me, they just didn't want to wait or they didn't want the weight. No one at Boutique Air is answering the phone. I'll never fly that little rinky dink plane again. I need my luggage or I'll continue to expand on this review.

### "customer service is outstanding"
I hope Boutique Air continues this service to altoona. I have been able to get my mother who lives in Altoona back and forth to Pittsburgh for medical treatment and advanced care she needs. The drive to Pittsburgh is atrocious and I hope boutique continues this route for a very long time. A total life saver and an awesome experience. Out of about 20 flights i have taken, only 3 have been delayed and very short about 20 minutes or so. Their customer service is outstanding and always so friendly

### "nice having a reliable company"
Massena to Boston. I flew once on the charter service on Boutique Air and multiple times on the commercial side of things. I am amazed on how professional and fun everyone is. We know about Boutique Air from living in upstate NY and so me and my 6 friends of mine chartered Boutique Air to New York City for my bachelorette party and then I often take them to Boston. I am hoping for more routes out of Massena since right now they only do Baltimore and Boston. Either way, its nice having a reliable company in my area that I can count on to get me where I need to be!

### "hope to fly you again some day"
I cannot say enough how much I enjoyed this airline experience. From the check in counter to the TSA at the local tiny airport to the pilots. It is totally a different way of flying commercial and just so much more personal. I wish more routes were like this because its such a nice experience. My flight was also 10 minutes early on arrival which allowed me to get to my next gate with ease. Thank you Boutique Air and hope to fly you again some day! (Maybe there will be wifi next time!)

### "The customer service of Boutique Air is terrible"
Not Verified |  The customer service of Boutique Air is terrible. I had a flight from Pittsburgh to Baltimore at 4.20 pm. When I arrived at the ticket counter, there was a sign that said that the agent leaves the ticket counter everyday at 3.00 pm. I needed to check my bag because of valuable liquids in my bag, since the agent was not there, I had to take my bag through TSA where the liquids were confiscated and thrown away. Finally, when I reached my gate, I asked the agent why she leaves the ticket counter at 3.00 when we have a 4.20 flight, and her response was "All the airlines leave at 3.00". When I called Boutique Air customer service to complain, I immediately asked for a manager, and the representative abruptly hung up on me. I called another day and was told that a manager would return my call. Naturally, I never got a returned call. The third time I called, I wasn't able to talk with anyone. A voicemail came on requesting I leave my name and phone number and "someone will return my call". Again, no one called me back. This airline is terrible. They owe me over $100 for the liquids that were taken from my bag.

### "Boutique was a novel experience"
As someone used to flying jets and on airlines that are at the very least using the branding of a larger carrier, Boutique was a novel experience but not one I’d jump for over a legacy carrier. Then again, the business model for Boutique relies on them being the only game in town for far-flung airports. My journey home from Boston began with a call from the ticket agent as I made my way to the airport. He pulls double duty as a gate agent of sorts and wanted me to call upon arrival. He then strongly implored me to bring my bag aboard. It was a chore to lug on and off the small aircraft but I managed. The interior of the aircraft was in good condition except for the carpeting, which could have used a cleaning. There are sodas and small water bottles aboard, as well as snack size bags of pretzels and the like. One of the pilots offered us some of these before we took off on the second leg. And a lesson I learned the hard way—the cup holders are not super deep so maybe don’t buy a large coffee or any other large unsealable beverage to take aboard, lest you wear some of it during takeoff. There was significant turbulence on our approaches, especially into Baltimore. Passengers can see straight ahead and through the cockpit window as the plane shakes with the runway in sight. I don’t get air sick but people who do might want to know that. I should stress, however, that I at no point felt unsafe. Boutique offers codeshare with United, through whom I booked this trip. However, you’ll want to read the fine print, since not all Boutique fares rack up United miles.

### "Very unreliable airline"
They took by bag at Pittsburgh and then came out and told us that our flight would either be a few hours delayed or canceled. This was at the time of departure 5 PM - last flight out for the day to AOO (I later learned that the plane was still in AOO with mechanical problems.) Returned in about 10 minutes to tell us it had been canceled and then vanished. We were what do we do now - no one there, no bags. It took him at least another 15 minutes to return with our bags. He should have told us where he was going. No other options were given. No cars were available one way to AOO so I had to contact someone to drive from Everett PA to Pittsburgh airport which is around 120 miles away. While I waited, after waiting there 3 hours for this flight after my flight had arrived from DFW. They are so unreliable and I have been trying to get a refund on my flight or travel expenses which seem to be impossible. Very unreliable airline - no customer service.

### "the employees are un-accommodating and rude"
This airline should be cancelled. I’ve flown Boutique several times to get to and from school. Every single time the flight has either been cancelled or delayed and the employees are un-accommodating and rude. Never flying again.

### "definitely not fly with them again"
The flight and pilots were nice but the young woman working at the airport check-in in Burlington VT on September 14, 2021, was incredibly rude and aggressive. I can not believe the attitude she dared to have! First, she purposefully talked so quietly that it was impossible to hear her, she mumbled the entire time, grabbed my hand luggage to weight it without explaining why, which had me surprised since this was not an international flight (I realized later that it was due to the size of the plane), she asked me the most random questions without context while rolling her eyes, and when I was leaving the counter the literally hissed at me "What's with the face" while staring me in the eye - I could not believe it. I understand that everyone can have a bad day but attacking well-meaning passengers like that is unheard of! I was flying back with the same airline the next day and luckily, another woman was working that day and everything was fine. I'll definitely not fly with them again.

### "two thumbs down to Boutique Air"
Not Verified | What a terrible experience! We booked our son on a flight from Altoona, PA, to El Paso, TX. The first leg of his travel was with Boutique Airlines (BA) to Puttsburgh, PA. BA said they couldn't fit my son's guitar on the plane and told him it would be shipped on a plane the next day by United Airlines (UA), which meant we would have to drive an hour and a half back to El Paso the next day to pick it up. The customer service rep offered no alternative solution other than to contact UA the next day to see if they would ship it. Then we had a text from our son saying that he missed his connecting flight in Pittsburgh because the flight departed late from Altoona and the UA connecting flight in Pittsburg left early! The UA rep told our son they left early because BA did not enter his name into the system, so UA thought all passengers were onboard! There were no more flights to El Paso that day so UA kindly put him up in a hotel and gave him a food voucher. Since the flight to El Paso the next day would have our son arriving too late to attend a planned event, we are now driving 3 hours to pick him up in Albuquerque! UA said they will arrange to have his luggage delivered to our door from from El Paso! So kudos to UA and two thumbs down to Boutique Air!

### "This airline failed me"
I had a departing flight for on 11/23 scheduled for 6pm to see my family for Thanksgiving. Just for context, this airline has two flights departing from my local airport each day: 12pm and 6pm. On 11/23, my 6pm was cancelled. I was assured that the next-day's flight would be highly unlikely to be cancelled, so I was rescheduled for the it: 11/24's, 6pm. The next day rolls around and I get a text at noon that this flight was also to be cancelled. Great, now I can't see my family for Thanksgiving. What baffles me is that on each of these days, both 12pm flights were not cancelled. The airline definitely knew in advanced that my 6pm would fall-through. Therefore, why was I not offered a seat on a 12pm? Especially on that second day - they had a customer who obviously would have faced a second cancellation in a row, yet it didn't cross anyone's mind to offer me a seat on the same-day's 12pm that was 'On Time'. They were professional about it. But customer service is their only saving grace considering they aren't competent enough to work out the logistics of how to reliably route flights. I know this because the reason I was told both of my flights were cancelled was because "The plane got held up at another airport. Yeah, that's right....not a serious maintenance, weather, or issue with the pilot. It was because a plane got held up and the pilot didn't have time to fly (as if they had another leg after that last 6pm flight for the day). This company needs to realize that people are depending on them for their travel plans - especially near the holidays. In the real world, airlines will depart at whatever time necessary to successfully get their passengers from A to B. These guys, however, don't take their company's mission seriously enough to follow through on that task. A little hiccup here and there? Flight cancelled. A parent of mine died. It was very important that I could be home with my family to spend our first Thanksgiving together in memory of her. This airline failed me. That's no longer going to happen. But at least I got a phone call from a customer service rep apologizing and offering a refund. This company is simply going to fail, because they focus less on how to coordinate flights professionally and instead spend that effort on how to apologize to customers professionally.

### "insanely unprofessional these people are"
I cannot express how insanely unprofessional these people are. I booked my flight a month in advance and, having been stranded at O'Hare before, I made sure to get there hours early to ensure there was no possibility I'd miss this flight. I got a boarding pass, but became suspicious when everyone else on the flight (there were only 8 passengers) was called to weigh carry-on luggage and I was not. When I asked at the gate, I was informed that the flight was full and there was a problem with my ticket, that for some reason, I was showing up as flying stand-by. Nope. The person at the counter repeatedly asked if I was "with Dan" or "Dan's girlfriend. When I said no, but asked how I could have been issued a boarding pass if the plane was full, I got a shrug. Refusing to give up my seat, the flight was continually delayed until hours later, they told us there were "mechanical issues" and then "bad weather" and that we should all plan to be back at 5:30 AM the next morning to depart. Of course, some people wanted refunds and some of us were out $250 for hotel rooms (Boutique says they'll reimburse up to $100, but that remains to be seen). The next morning, those of us who still wanted to fly were there at 5:30, but again, delayed - no communication from Boutique, just no one present at the gate. Finally, a staff person showed up around 8 AM and as inconvenienced passengers complained about the delay, one woman, who had not been scheduled to fly the night before, laughed and said, "Well, it definitely won't leave without us. I have the pilot's coffee! Why is that relevant? Because a plane full of people were delayed for over 12 hours, paying for food and lodging in Chicago, because the pilot wanted his girlfriend on the flight. With a full plane, there wasn't room for her as a passenger on the manifest until the inconvenience persuaded some people to go with alternative transportation. Once we boarded the plane, she sat in the cockpit with him for the duration. Unbelievable. Never again. Which works, actually, because they no longer serve my local airport after their door opened on takeoff leaving Minneapolis earlier this year. So much for that "flawless" safety record.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
This is the worst airline I have ever flown with. The customer service lady was asleep and the baggage handler) was rude to my daughter and other customers. He even made a point to loud talk a lady in a wheelchair because she didn’t get his calls. Flight delayed for 8 hours and even the chat people are rude. Save your money and time!

### "Delayed my flight last minute"
Delayed my flight last minute from Altoona to Pittsburgh due to the weather. It was a 30-minute flight and the weather was clear and sunny in both locations. I told them this would cause me to miss my connecting flight and that I'd have to rent a car. They did not even refund my $40 (petty) I was told that there was nothing they could do.

### "Absolutely horrible in every way possible"
Not Verified |  If you enjoy getting furious and having travel plans completely screwed then book a flight with Boutique. Standing at the airport, no notice of cancellation and customer service simply says “nothing we can do”. Absolutely horrible in every way possible.

### "unreliable and unprofessional"
Not Verified |  I wish I had read these reviews before booking. The company is unreliable and unprofessional. They left me stranded in Vermont with no options. My only notification that our flight was cancelled was a text message shortly before I was due to arrive at the airport. I called customer service and they were terrible, just totally unhelpful and unconcerned. Only other option to fly on another airline was 4x price of their flight and they said they would only refund up to $150 and make no attempt to assist in rebooking. Only explanation was "flight crew unavailable". Seems like this is not an uncommon occurrence with them. Do not fly this airline.

### "company is unprofessional"
The airline was several hours late. Every 30 minutes it was pushed back further. Our airplane was in another state on the ground at our expected boarding time. I could have driven to my destination in less time then I waited for this flight. The company is unprofessional and will screw your travel plans. I will never fly boutique air again.

### "unprofessionalism is unbelievable"
I will never fly your airline again. The level of unprofessionalism is unbelievable. My family was scheduled to fly from Dallas, TX to Greenville, MS on August 8, 2021 at 6:40 p.m. We returned our rental car to the main terminal and called your airlines as instructed, for a ride to your terminal. Of course, no one answered. We called your Customer Service (CS), who transferred us to another number, where again, no one answered. We decided to take a cab to your terminal. We arrived at your terminal at 5:30 p.m. No one was there. We were still assuming our flight would be leaving on time. After waiting for 40 minutes, my daughter received a text from Boutique at 6:10 p.m., stating our flight was cancelled. She immediately calls CS and we are told, "no flights are available until Tuesday". We are educators and our first day of school was Monday. Boutique did not even have the decency to have someone at their counter. We literally had to beg a neighboring airline crew for a ride to the main terminal to try and rent a car to drive six hours home. We had to pay $500 for a rental car. Boutique says they will reimburse $150, but it will take a couple of weeks. We probably will never see that money. We did not make it home until 3:00 a.m. And yes, we went to work and did our job! !

### "left stranded in Baltimore"
Because my flight was cancelled with this airline, I was left stranded in Baltimore. The flight for the next evening was also cancelled. My whole weekend was ruined because of this. I got a hotel room for the night. The next day my husband drove three hours to pick me up, and three hours back. When I received a text that my hotel reimbursement was declined, I was not a happy camper. I will never, ever fly this airline.

### "I was stranded with no option"
I booked a flight to Nashville through a travel agency with this airline. The route showed a change of planes in Muscle Shoals, AL. After successfully checking in Pensacola, the plane arrived on time for departure and we left for Muscle Shoals. I was enjoying the flight and we landed successfully in AL for my change of planes. That is where my nightmare begin. After departing the plane, I questioned the agent on which gate I need to be at for my departure for Nashville. I was then informed that this airline no longer flew out of Muscle Shoals to Nashville, TN. I asked her why the airline ticket agent in Pensacola allowed me to check in when he clearly knew my destination. I also asked why wasn't I informed to this prior to the flight. She informed me that her boss had contacted all passengers headed to Nashville. I assured her that I had flight information that had been sent to me the same day with no changes in my flight. Of course, she blamed the travel agency. She informed me that this change had occurred over a month ago. However, my sister reviewed the site the same day and it showed the same flight information that I had. I asked about being rerouted through another airline, as I purchased the travel insurance, but was told that this airline was the only airline that flew out of this hub and the nearest airport was over an hour away. After realizing that I was stranded with no option, other than renting a car and driving myself, I contacted a friend who drove over 4 hours to get me. Of course, this problem caused me to not be able to reach the hotel that I planned to spend the night, which is another story. Because I booked it online, every number that I called to cancel, either could not find my booking or said that I had to cancel through the travel agency itself, making it impossible to cancel before the check-in. Needless to say, I had to pay for a rental car, pay for a hotel that I didn't get to use, pay for another flight home, and inconvenience a friend who ended up driving over 11 hours for an inconvenience created by this airline. What I don't understand is this: If this airline had attempted to contact me unsuccessfully, why didn't they send me an email? Although my travel agency is working with me, but the airline refused a full refund. In fact, they still want to charge me for taking to Muscle Shoals, AL, which is a location their airline routed me to that I never intended or wanted to go and had difficulty leaving and finding an alternate route to my original destination. I spent a total of 13 hours and $700 dealing with an error created by airline, not to mention the stress incurred.

### "This airline is a joke"
Not Verified |  14 july 2021, booked on flight, 5 hour delay then at end of delay flight was canceled. Had to book a flight on American Airlines. Told by Boutique Air that cost of flight would be reimbursed and submitted claim at that time. Was told that cost would be reimbursed, no capped amount discussed. I talked with two people who stated cost would be reimbursed. Total cost $229.00. On 21 July called and was told that max reimbursement was capped at $150. This airline is a joke and will never in my life give them any business ever

### "The price seemed enticing"
What a nightmare. Flight was delayed an hour before take-off. I was en route to the airport and they called me and asked me if I was there yet, when I said no, they said, “okay we’ll wait for you” even though my flight wasn’t scheduled to leave for another hour? Got a text immediately after saying it was delayed until 10.25. It is currently 10.35 with no agent in sight and I have not been boarded. The price seemed enticing - I will happily pay 4x the amount next time to find reliable service.

### "whole fiasco cost me much more"
Not Verified |  Flew from Altoona to BWI to catch a flight to LAX. Very quick and convenient. Imagine my surprise when 3 days before our return trip I was notified that our flight was moved ahead 2 hours, making it impossible to make the connecting flight back from LAX. The glib suggestion of rescheduling for the next day was impossible due to work commitments. The request that they wait 1/2 hour so that we could get on the flight was also quickly dismissed, even though on an 8 seat plane we would have been 25% of the passengers. The cost to reschedule our cross country flight would have been over 1000. Luckily we were able to get a credit from southwest and schedule a flight into state college instead. After spending about 3 hours on hold with various entities, we were told that we would be refunded what amounted to 25% of the cost of the flight (which I still haven't seen) This whole fiasco cost me much more, a whole morning of a weekend visit to my son who lives across the country to try to figure it out!

### "dishonest and unreliable airline"
Boutique Air is a dishonest and unreliable airline. Moreover, the customer service is extremely poor. Our flight from Boston to Massena was delayed two and a half hours. The airline did nothing to accommodate our concerns. We’re will never fly again! Don’t waste your money and time!

### "Boutique Air is always delayed"
This airline is a huge scam: Every single flight is delayed or cancelled. We lost 2 days of vacation to start with because after our luggage was not transferred from our AA flight to Air Boutique, they put it on the 'next' flight: the next flights kept being delayed and then finally cancelled for 24 hours! On the way back, the same! They delayed the flight first of one hour, then two hours, so we lost our following flight. Boutique Air is always delayed.

### "Two thumbs down"
I bought a package of 10 vouchers to be used over a 12 month period however after COVID hit nobody could fly. I asked them to extend my redemption period due to the pandemic and they told me to call the month they are due to expire and they would take care of it then. Now they are refusing to extend my redemption period and allow me to use the remaining unused vouchers. Most major airlines have made exceptions for using purchased tickets due to the pandemic. The front line employees that answer the phone will not assist or connect me with a supervisor. I have tried to call 20 plus times to hopefully reach an understanding person with CS skills but have not been successful. I do not recommend doing business with Boutique. They provide zero access to Supervisory personnel or opportunity for resolution of any issue. First lip service and now no service. Two thumbs down.

### "definitely fly with them again2
It was clean the staff were so nice and courteous. I am not a frequent flyer and they made it so comfortable for me and I really appreciate that. I will definitely fly with them again.

### "refuse to provide adequate help"
Not Verified |  Disgusted with this company. I flew early December and my flight was canceled. Things happen, I get it. Even though they strung us along at the airport postponing the flight for 4+ hours before finally canceling it. Per their policy, if the flight is canceled they will provide reimbursement with a variety of options (i.e. meals/rides/rental car up to a certain amount). I was to be reimbursed for about 90$ and sent in all my paperwork (receipts, etc). It took 6 weeks to get a check that was not authorized meaning I couldn't cash it. I called their customer service number which was an out of country call center and was promised a new check would be sent. It never was. I have made 4-5 calls every 4 weeks or so requesting a new check and have gotten no where on this issue. Some reps say it has not been processed through accounting, some have said it's been sent and it'll be here soon. But nothing. It's now mid-April and I think it's safe to say this company sucks and I will not see my reimbursement. Don't fly with this company. They refuse to provide adequate help to their customers. Completely pathetic.

### "never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Baltimore to Pittsburgh. Horrible airline. I checked in online and arrived to the ticket counter on time and no one was there to check my bag. After calling a representative they said to throw out my liquids over 3oz and to go through security. So I did. I get to the gate before boarding. I stand up to board and they said I can’t get on the flight because I didn’t check in at the ticket counter (which was their fault). I asked to talk to someone who could help me get on a flight. They said they can’t help and walked into an employees only room. When I called the airline, they would only offer me credit for airline, which I don’t want because I will never fly with them again.

### "they earned 10 stars"
Not Verified | Dallas to Victoria. Well, first leg of my flight was with American airlines. I paid for extra legroom and I guess I'm glad I did since it seemed a bit cramped. When I landed at DFW I Alfred one of the AA gate personnel where I needed to go according to my boarding pass. He explained precisely the gate to go to. I found the gate went outside to smoke came back in and was waiting for my flight and boarding to begin. At around 7:25 am I got a call asking if I was still intending to make my flight. I said yes, I'm at the gate. The gentleman asked me to describe where exactly I was, so I did and told him the AA gate staff sent me there. He told me they had sent me to the wrong place and to go outside and he would pick me up in 5 minutes. The driver showed up in a very nice well-equipped luxury suburban and apologized for AA giving me the wrong info and stated they know that Boutique contracts with them. I wasn't able to get to their terminal till my flight was scheduled to already leave but the driver called and said I was in-bound. I was taken through their terminal which was actually 3 miles away from the main airport so AA really screwed up in telling me where to go. I got on the plane and had a huge amount of leg room. It was the first time I've 1 flown with Boutique 2 flown on a single-engine prop plane. No, it wasn't y'all enough to stand erect in the plane but I will say this, because of the way they did me if I can fly Boutique Air on subsequent flights I will do so every single time from now on. They were far better than the normal airlines I've flown on in the past. I saw where someone complained about the departure and arrival time is late. All I can say is they might have been trying to help another customer as they did for me. I would say they earned 10 stars.

### "never on time"
Massena to Boston. This airline is never on time. I fly Boutique Air because it is the only option where I am currently working. Every flight I have been on has either been delayed or cancelled. A representative will call me hours before the flight to let me know. This airline makes it about as inconvenient as possible for getting you where you need to be. Avoid this airline if you have other options available.

### "how flying should be"
Cortez to Denver. From customer service to the pilots you always feel like first class. Great pilots, great ground crew. This company goes above and beyond to make you feel at home. Will be flying again many times. Great company that knows how to help out a customer. Go directly through Boutique Air. Cheap o air totally hosed me. Great group here. Would tell anyone to fly with these guys. Pilots were fun and very professional. This is how flying should be.

### "absolutely the worst airline"
Victoria to Houston. This is absolutely the worst airline I have ever used. They left my bag behind then refused to get it later. They have been rude to me, they have lied to me. Save yourself the trouble and make your trip cheaper by just driving to a different airport. Their aeroplane didn't even have air conditioning.

### "Boutique Air is unbelievably unreliable"
Denver to Chadron. Boutique cancelled my flight 0704 at 1:40 pm due to mechanical issues. Rebooked me on their 6:00 pm flight 0713, Cancelled that flight. Booked me on a 9:30 flight 0704 and it’s now 1:46 am not even boarding yet. Boutique Air is unbelievably unreliable. 12 hours after my original flight departure time and we are still sitting at the A66 gate of DIA with no word as to when we will fly! Make other travel plans!

### "terrible with customer service"
Alamosa to Albuquerque. Landing safely was the only positive event of our entire experience with Boutique Air. Both flights were +2hrs late, almost missed the connecting flight in ABQ. When enquiring about the flight status, their personnel claimed to be unable or unwilling to track incoming flights or estimate how long the delay would be. The airline personnel are incompetent, arrogant, uncaring and absolutely terrible with customer service. They act as if you are doing the customer a favor by providing the flight. Makes one wonder what kind of maintenance program is implemented if the public face of the company is so terrible. They have the market cornered and are the only game in town for a lot of regional airports. That is the ONLY way they can possibly stay in business. This airline is worse that Spirit. I can't see how this airline can possibly stay in business if there is even the slightest competition. Every passenger I spoke to said they would fly another airline if there was another choice.
