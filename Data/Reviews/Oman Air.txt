### "I have not received a refund"
My daughter and her injured friend were denied boarding by Oman Air in Delhi on 21st March due to the wrong address being provided by for the pre departure medical form. Despite being told at time of booking and at the airport there would be no charge levied they subsequently charged £4303.77 for two fully flexible business class tickets. Despite several email requests I have not received a refund. This is not how a decent and professional company operates. At the time of booking the flight the advisor stated several times that there would be no charge if the individuals were not able to fly. Shocking conduct and a very poor experience.

### "exceed the return ticket cost"
I bought an Oman Air 'Flex' ticket with No change fees but they wanted to charge me more than the full, return-ticket price to delay my return flights MNL-MCT-LHR date by 30 days. Oman Air applies change of date charges that can exceed the original return ticket cost. Therefore, I cancelled the return sector for a partial refund and went elsewhere to fly home. Flex' tickets only waive the fee for making a date-change; the kicker is the cost associated with the actual date selected.

### "denied a phone call, beverages and food"
The flight was delayed by more than 2 hours. My son, 16 years old and traveling alone was denied a phone call, beverages and food. They wouldn't even give the possibility to charge his phone. Since in Muscat his connecting flight in Mumbai was gone, I needed to buy him a new ticket (for which Oman Air is not compensating). I called the office in Mumbai, but they weren't even willing to forward a message to him, let alone having called me. It is only thanks to a stranger who borrowed his phone that I was able to solve the situation.

### “I was impressed”
Not Verified | I was impressed, and there is room for improvement. Both sectors departed and arrived on time. Suprisingly Calm and efficient boarding the Aircraft, which was pristine, two very hard working and happy Crew’s. With a rather Comfortable seat. On Both Sectors the Aircraft appeared full, I tried to be a smart snagging a decent seat at online check in. Many carriers allow you to select an alternate seat should you be allocated a poor one. Omar Air do not and I had 46H and 46F in the aft cabin right at the rear of the Aircraft. The Forward Cabin is far more appealing and it served me right. Seriously consider paying for a seat there. That said if wasn’t onerous. Should they address two things they are up there, even nicer than the usual “elite” Middle Eastern Carriers. A spectacular dawn arrival into Muscat was an unexpected treat, and what a delightful Airport. Please address. 1. Economy Catering. Plastic cutlery, Tray looks cheap and nasty, and it was sparse. Two choices including the apparently notorious Chicken with Rice which is exceptionally unappealing. Same meal on both sectors. 2. IFE. Such a shame, as the Screen is of exceptional quality. Content falls well short of the competition here. Despite the “Mealplan” and Tedious IFE I’d still recommend.

### “staff were attentive”
I had travelled from LHR to Muscat and had a day tour in Muscat. The lounge at Muscat was amazing and staff were attentive. Boarding to KUL there was clearly an issue as no welcome drink was served. The cabin manager checked in and apologised once we got going. Food plentiful, entertainment was fine, wifi poor. The staff were aware I had an hour before my next flight and helped me disembark first. Great airline.

### Oman Air customer review
Not Verified |  Great space. Felt secure and secluded as a solo traveller. Staff were great, in a full cabin they were onto everything. The wifi was dreadful though. Food plentiful and tasty. An hour and a half late leaving but with snow in UK that’s hardly surprising.

### “crew were polite and helpful”
Brilliant Airline! Very pleasantly surprised. I recently flew with Oman Air on two sectors. One was very short haul and one was mid range. Both flights were nice. The crew were polite and helpful, the food was very good and the IFE was quite impressive. The planes were clean and comfortable. The prices were very competitive.

### "Catering is very basic"
Checked in online using their app which has very basic functionality. No option to choose seats which is annoying. Check-in was quick and easy but they couldn’t print our connecting QF boarding pass beyond Jakarta which caused an hour of inconvenience in Jakarta. Both flights were very full. The 737 has about 2 inches less legroom than the 787 so not a pleasant experience. Catering is very basic. They have a chicken rice creation which appears on every flight. Sometimes a choice. I tried a creamy pasta which was lukewarm and bland. Almost no vegetables in any dish. Crew seemed to just go through the motions. When we landed in Jakarta and turned off the runway half the passengers got up, opened the overhead bins and started to walk to the exit. Apart from one feeble announcement in English no effort was made to control the unsafe situation. Appalling.

### "baggage allowance re sporting equipment"
The business class is of the standard now expected for full service airlines. It is not a stand out but also no clear faults. The policy for baggage allowance re sporting equipment is out of sync with major airlines however. They charge extra when an item exceeds 159cm rather than the standard 210cm. This means if you are flying with a bicycle or surfboard for example do not use Oman.

### "no one has responded"
I was traveling with a family of 6 people, including 3 children, from London to Phuket on May. I chose this airline because of the departure and arrival times at the destination, I really wanted to land there in the evening and only these airlines had such a flight on that day. I wanted us to be able to skip the jet lag. Unfortunately, for reasons unknown to us, our flight was canceled and the next one was 14 hours later. We lost our prepaid airport transfer, overnight hotel stay, and landed in Thailand at 8 am. instead of the one day before- evening. I filed a feedback on the Oman air website, but unfortunately no one has responded to it yet. I've made 5 calls to customer service this week and each time I get the answer that someone will respond to my comment tomorrow. Additionally, one of the consultants shouted at me on the phone and when I asked for his name and to talk to someone above him, he put me on hold and ended my call after 20 minutes. So far, I have used Qatar Airways for such distances and I have never encountered anything like this

### "courteous, smiling and helpful"
Not Verified |   On my flight from Muscat to London WY101. I was seated on 27J seat. The cabin crew by the name of Kim was very courteous, smiling and helpful. She was very calm and polite to passengers.

### “laziest cabin crew”
Not Verified | The rudest and laziest cabin crew, not everyone, but the females. Had to take their Flight from Muscut to Cochin on 24/4/24 taking off at 2.05am. Lame excuses given for any request made and waking up toddlers in the middle of the night and making them cry, even after requesting for a seat belt extension as the baby was comfortably sleeping on the mother’s lap. Total contrast to the softspoken and friendly staff usually met onboard.

### "found the return cancelled"
Oman Air decided in January to stop flying from Male as of April 1. We were booked on return flights on April 6, at no stage did Oman Air attempt to contact us about the cancellation of the return flight. The day before our flight was due to leave we logged in after upgrading the outbound leg and found the return cancelled. It has taken 28 hours and 6 phone calls to get any response from Oman Air, and they insist on sending us via Oman after getting us from Male to Doha, saying there are no seats from Doha to London, but on the Qatar web site I am able to book seats. The customer service staff have no ability to anything but email operations and that seems to be largely ignored. This was entirely avoidable and could have been an opportunity for Oman Air to delight us, but they chose to turn it into a crisis, causing a huge amount of stress. My advice is never use them.

### "there are no non-veg meals"
Really horrible food and cabin services. They say there are no non-veg meals while flying from Bangalore to Muscat and back from Muscat to Bangalore. In both flights the cabin crew are saying the airline hasn’t sent them enough non-veg meals. This happening once can be understood but twice is in 4 flights is bad.

### "I would fly them again"
Not Verified | An amazing experience! They were friendly, food was good, and accommodating. I would fly them again. I would recommend this company to anyone.

### "I am significantly out of pocket"
I booked a return flight with Oman Air to Sri Lanka back in November. Around a month ago I got a text message from Oman Air saying that my flights had been cancelled and that I would be contacted by the team to reschedule the flights. Having then had a google, it turned out that Oman Air had cancelled that route entirely. I was supposed to fly on 31 March, the route had been cancelled from 31 March. I rung Oman Air to book onto different flights, and the alternative flights they offered me took 24 hours on the way there, and 30 hours on the way back. The flights I had originally booked were around 13 hours long. I was appalled by this and do not think this meets the definition of 'alternative flights'. But I stayed calm and asked if I could have a refund and also some compensation to mean I am not at a loss with the new flights. Oman Air's decision to cancel the flights at the busiest period (we were flying on Easter Sunday) meant that other flights were over double what we originally paid, so I asked for Oman Air to make up the difference, a not unreasonable request I do not think. The call centre told me to email the refund team with your request, and that they didn't have a phone number, was email only. I then sent multiple emails, and tried to speak to agents via twitter, whilst also calling the help centre, who couldn't help me. My request for compensation was getting ignored. As a compromise, I then asked to move my outbound flight a day earlier, when the route was operating to Sri Lanka, and get a refund on my flight back to London instead of taking their 30 hour option and take the financial hit on the way back by booking my return. The customer service agent told me the only way I could do that is by switching both flights, getting on my outbound, landing in Colombo and once I land in Colombo then request a refund for the return. He said the refund would be 'instant'. This really upset me though as Oman air is assuming I have the financial capacity to pay for a return flight without receiving a refund for the flight already booked. At that point I had completely given up on Oman Air and asked for a full refund of both flights. Again this had to be done through the refund team who do not reply to emails. I called the help centre to ask the status of the refund, they 'couldn't tell me'. I then asked how long it takes for the refund to come in, they couldn't tell me that either. Being unbelievably unhelpful, all the while I am out of pocket. I finally got an email back saying that the refund would take 14-30 working days. That is absolute madness. And also goes against what the agent said about refund being instant. In between this, I kept trying to contact the team via twitter. Then two spam accounts posing as Oman Air CEO offered to help me, if I sent my details. This was a fake account, that other people were sending details to. I notified Oman Air about this too. They ignored that. I finally got the refund, have booked new flights with Etihad which were over double the cost. I am significantly out of pocket. I have submitted a formal complaint but no reply as of yet!

### "a very enjoyable flight"
It was a very enjoyable flight, and the 8 hours spent on board the plane went by pleasantly. The cabin crew were very professional and friendly. The food service offered a respectable selection, and the meals were very good. The business class seats were roomy and comfortable. I was not overly impressed with the in-flight entertainment, however. Limited selection and difficult to use handsets. Otherwise, everything else was top notch.

### "Very nice and helpful staff"
Everything from check in until we arrived at our final destination was incredibly smooth. Very nice and helpful staff, wonderful food and plenty of space to sit/lie down, like a small room of your own. Sometimes you wish the flight had been longer.

### "Such a great experience"
Not Verified |  When we got to check-in the staff were really nice and check-in was open early. The ground crew were really straight forward they didn't mess about. The cabin crew were really friendly. The was really comfy. I was able to get a few hours sleep. Such a great experience.

### "a mere 2 kgs of excess luggage"
My experience with Oman Air on a flight from London to Muscat to Hyderabad was nothing short of a nightmare. From the moment I boarded, it became apparent that this was the worst flight I had ever taken. The trouble began at Hyderabad airport, where they created a major issue over a mere 2 kgs of excess luggage. The flight was a complete failure; my food was subpar, and the boarding process was chaotic. Muscat Airport duty-free prices were exorbitant, making basic food and drinks ridiculously expensive. Onboard, the crew pretended to be helpful, only to later aggressively solicit surveys.

### "A pleasant surprise"
A pleasant surprise. We booked Oman Air because it seemed the best value for the times and dates we were travelling, but had no nigh expectations. Seating was comfortable for economy class and on-board staff were helpful and friendly. Meals were delicious, although more choice would have been good. Full marks to the producers of the safety video, which gave all the necessary information, while simultaneously showcasing the natural beauty of Oman, thus avoiding boredom. Entertainment offered an excellent choice of movies, including both new releases and classics, although it was short on European films not originally in English. Transit through Muscat airport was painless, with an efficient safety check. Arrival in Bangkok was timely. Our main complaint was that problems in the online check-in system did not allow us to check in early.

### "brand ambassador of hospitality"
I was given this connecting flight by Turkish Airlines. On the flight I was served by Almohtasem the most personable cabin crew I have met. He was extremely polite, did everything with a smile and kept coming around to ask if we needed anything. He is certainly the brand ambassador of hospitality and good service .

### "Good service by cabin crew"
Good service by cabin crew. A gentle smile face with warm welcome by crew. Clean washroom and good food. Thanks of my safe journey.

### "the whole flight it was really hot"
Not Verified |  We travelled to Muscat from Manila, Philippines last July 21, 2023 via WY 844. Me and my husband have an infant and a 2-year old kid travelling with us. We checked in with a long line but fortunately, have checked with the ground crew that I can fall in line in Business Class lane since I am a Sindbad Silver holder. Everything was smooth until the boarding. They prioritized us boarding the plane because I am a Sindbad Silver member and I have an infant and kid travelling with me. Unfortunately, an hour after the plane take off, we complained already with the flight attendant to adjust the air conditioners temperature since it is hot. They said they will not knowing that there was indeed a problem with the air-conditioning. For the whole flight it was really hot. No one from the crew apologized on the condition and for the passengers, we just have no other choice but to pacify ourselves.

### "no priority services for the infant"
Not Verified |  The first leg of our journey was good. The second leg was tough! Not infant friendly, the host forgot to provide the infant seatbelt for take off. With an infant a 7 hour flight in a mid row seat is not easy, at check in they left an adjacent free for some reason but someone sat there. There was no priority services for the infant.

### "no proper communication"
Two delays for 1 flight, failed take off, canceled flight and reschedule for 24 hours later and arriving with a broken suitcase at the end! The worst of all - no proper communication from anyone - starting from the pilot, cabin crew on board to the baggage claim and ground airlines crew.

### "the experience was excellent"
Our overall experience was excellent. Our Apex Suites extremely comfortable and spacious. The food and service outstanfing, especially on the sector delhi to Muscat on our return. However, we sat in seats 15A and B which is the small cabin with only 6 seats. On the outward these seats were fine except by the time they got to us they had no sleep suits available in my size. Sadly the same cannot be said for the return. Although the standard of food and service (once they remembered we were there as we were the only passengers in the cabin) was excellent, because they take food orders from the front cabin first, by the time they got to us there was no amuse buche left, and neither my appetizer or dessert choice which was extremely disappointing. Also no amenity kits were brought round (we may have been forgotten yet again?) We would definitely fly Oman Air again as the experience was excellent but would I choose seats 15A and 15B again - I'm not sure. Also I am very disappointed with the " after service " as I wrote to Oman Air in Muscat to point out the problems experienced in these seats at least 3 weeks ago and they haven't responded. I did expect better from such a good airline.

### "polite, helpful and efficient"
The gentleman named Raghed at the check-in desk at London Heathrow is a legend. He is polite, helpful and efficient. Moved the seats on request and even blocked the seats next to us to ensure I can lay down on the over night flight.

### "very polite and humble"
I found the crew staff of Economy class are very polite and humble and cooperative. As a whole I am satisfied from the services of Oman Air. On time flight on time arrival.

### "ignored my complaint"
Good business class seat for solo traveller and mostly friendly and productive crew on the way. On both legs of my flight, Oman Air forgot my vegetarian meal. While this can happen, the crew blamed me for this. And they did not do the least to provide me some alternative meals on this flight. Also customer service only blamed me and ignored my complaint after that.

### "comfy with lots of leg room"
I was very disappointed. Good things to comment, they were on time, the plane was comfy with lots of leg room and very clean. Bad things, food was awful, only offered a small fish curry or veggie noodles. The dessert and side dish were definitely not something I’d serve to anyone. Salad was apple with carrot. The snack later was=bread with lettuce and chicken. They ran out of apple juice when they were giving out drinks. There was no headphones to watch movies on a 6.25h journey.

### "Worst experience"
Worst experience with an airline. On the departure in Zurich already 90 minutes delay because of deicing. We had a connecting flight from Muscat and were worried to miss this. This was smiled at by the staff. On site then we only managed to catch our flight by running. When checking in online for the return flights, we were offered "premium seats" for the two flights: we spent 100€ because extra leg room and space was suggested. We did this because the outbound flight was quite modest in terms of comfort. Big surprise when boarding: the premium seats are normal economy seats and there were no benefits for the money paid. I have demanded my money back. After 2 weeks l received an email but they hid behind the policies that these tickets were not refundable. Once and never again Oman Air.

### "The flight was very comfortable"
The flight was very comfortable and we had no issues during check-in from Dammam. The flight was full and the service on board the aircraft was very good and the staff was very friendly. I was surprised at how good the food was on the second leg of the journey from Muscat to Kozhikode. The flight was comfortable but I would recommend they add more leg space. It can get a tad bit uncomfortable.

### "meant to have extra legroom"
I had the worst experience on the flight from LHR to GOI, I purchased a premium seat which was meant to have extra legroom which was 30A on the 787 seat map it showed that there was plenty of space. But to my surprise this seat did not have a window and it was before the partition which did not leave much space.

### "such a great experience"
Not Verified | I travelled through Oman Air for the first time. I was not expecting it to be such a great experience. Totally value for money. Feels like they will beat Emirates soon.

### "Crew attentive and service oriented"
Traveled MCT-COK-MCT (outbound Economy and inbound Business). Had a good flight both ways. Food was okay for this short flight. Crew attentive and service oriented. On time performance. Had a good experience with Oman Air. Clean aircraft and timely performance.

### "no one in the customer service office"
Slow response of the staff, and no one at Frankfurt airport in the customer service office. I have a connecting flight from AMS, and it was very tight in time. In the end, I missed my flight and luggage. Don’t really recommend it

### "very underrated airline in my opinion"
A very underrated airline in my opinion, it boasts a very new and updated fleet of Boeing 787s and 737s with well-trained and competent crew put in charge of the flights. 4 flights in total and none of them were late, as others have pointed out they are surprisingly very good with being on-time. They also provided additional snacks and drinks on top of the regular meal service. Decent legroom in line with international-standard full-service carriers. The only two minor gripes I may have is that the selection of movies and IFE is somewhat limited, and connecting flights as Muscat Airport involve a lengthy wait to get through security.

### "Service was rushed"
Service was rushed especially the Muscat to Manila flight. Also no alcohol was served which was a let down. Being first timer on Omar Air I was excited but I was wrong.

### "I enjoyed flying with Oman Air"
Not Verified |  I enjoyed flying with Oman Air. The service, food, airplane, customer care, all that was very good. I can't complain and I don't understand why people are complaining,. This Airline is very good and I will fly with them again.

### "Highly recommend it"
Not Verified |  The service and comfort was fairly decent for the price paid. Good IFE with a responsive screen and a recent selection of movies. An aperitif was served, main dish was good. The crew is friendly and passed several times to bring water. Alcohol was served. The only letdown was the breakfast which was only a pie. But this is a short flight only 7h. Overall on par with emirates at a third of the price. Highly recommend it.

### "such a friendly professional staff"
Amazing ground work staff at the airport in London as well as in Colombo. Never experienced such a friendly professional staff with any other airline. Also they check luggage tickets at the belt to make sure the luggage goes to the person it owns.

### "They offer excellent value for money"
Another excellent flight with Oman Air. This was part of my return trip having vacationed in the Philippines for 3 weeks. Oman Air is new to me still, and I really like their long haul product. They offer excellent value for money, their aircraft's are young compared to many airlines, and the cabin interior is lovely. The food on-board was fine for Economy Class, the seats comfortable and the staff friendly and helpful. I've also noticed that Oman Air is very punctual, which is a massive plus these days! Overall, very happy, and already looking at booking another trip with Oman Air next year.

### "I was very happy with everything about this flight"
Final leg of my trip home to London. I was very happy with everything about this flight - the food, cabin crew, seat comfort and punctuality. I've had a really great experience with Oman Air over the last month, and really rate them highly. My only criticism of Oman Air is that on this flight, I bought one of their (overpriced) WiFi packages as I needed to do some work emails, and the WiFi is painfully slow. Whilst I realise at 40,000ft I can't expect lightning fast, at almost $40, it should be better.

### "I cannot fault Oman Air"
An excellent flight. Arrived early in Manila, and the service onboard was great. My partner and I had been allocated three seats due to problems checking in online (22A, 22B, 22C) and it was great to be at the front and have a spare seat. The meal service was excellent, and we were regularly offered drinks and water. It was a morning flight (breakfast was sausage and eggs) and before we landed we were offered a snack box with a pastry and a cake - we were never hungry or thirsty, IFE offered plenty of choice. Seats were comfortable and cabin crew service excellent. A very new aircraft and I cannot fault Oman Air.

### "an excellent flight"
Overall, an excellent flight. I had had some difficulties checking in online, whereby I had checked in, had boarding passes emailed, and then the check in disappeared from my account on the app and website! When I contacted the call centre, they couldn't help me. However, when I arrived at Heathrow, and when I explained, the Supervisor was VERY apologetic, and as I was traveling with my partner, she booked us on the front row of Economy, and gave the two of us THREE seats (20A, 20B, 20C) - extra legroom, as well as 22A, 22B, and 22C on our next flight. Great customer service. The experience at Heathrow was great - very efficient and fast boarding for all passengers. The service onboard was superb. We had a chicken curry meal for dinner, and regular drinks (including alcohol, tea and coffee, juices, and plentiful water were offered). Breakfast was a small snack box with a hot pastry and small cake. The seat was comfortable and the legroom was excellent. The IFE was sufficient with plenty of choice. I'm struggling to fault Oman Air here - they're great value for money and offer great service.

### "left us in the airport in the middle of the night"
Airline moved the flight schedule and then promised overnight hotel due to the 1 day layover. Then they lied about providing accommodation and left us in the airport in the middle of the night. The airline website does not allow you to get any refunds as it goes in a loop. This is an airline with no customer service and has staff that do not care. Never going to fly them again.

### "I would highly recommend"
I would highly recommend and fly with Oman Air again without hesitation. Every flight departed on time and arrived either on Time or early. All staff interactions were Excellent. Professional and eager to meet every request. Food was bountiful and high class. Plane seats were well laid out and clean. Oman Air lounge in Bangkok was small an a little cramped however in Muscat the lounge was splendid. If the right pricing was again available for the route I would book without hesitation.

### "sitting apart from their parents"
We had  paid extra to be able to select our seats in advance as we want to make sure that we are sitting next to our two young children. For the second leg we had selected seats 33F, 33K, 33J and 33H. I was astonished to discover at boarding in Muscat that my seats had not only been changed post on-line check-in at Bangkok airport, but also at the point of boarding Oman Air were once again changing our seats. Twice after our online check-in and advanced seat selection without being informed. Neither of these seat changes were acceptable given that we had deliberately paid for "Economy Smart" class to allow us to select our seats at a cost significantly higher than the standard rate. The new seating had both our children sitting next to a stranger and my wife and I behind them. This is never a seating arrangement that we would choose as we always select three by a window and one across the aisle. It raises safeguarding issues with our young children as we do not know the nature of the people they are sitting with. I complained at the boarding desk who informed me that the flight was full but she would get customer services. Twenty minutes later the customer service representative turned up and informed me there was nothing she could do. I received no apology and had to board the plane with our 7 and 10 year olds sitting apart from their parents. They were distressed as were we. On our return I made a complaint through the online form only to receive a standard canned response. When I queried the response, as I hadn't received the service that I paid for, I received a one sentence follow up which does not make sense "With regards to the seats please be advised that the selected seats were payable seats which required to be paid. I have since sought clarification on the response but have been ignored. I cannot fathom why Oman Air would separate children from their parents and not inform them until the gate, particularly when we purchased advanced seat selection through our choice of fare. Looking at who was sitting in the seats we originally selected it did not appear that they required special assistance and the aircraft was the same as advertised. Finally the response from the customer service assistant is lacking in compassion and understanding. His response to this issue, along with the service we received when attempting to board the plane is some of the worst customer experience I have received in nearly four decades of flying. I emailed senior executives about this issue, the emails have not bounced but been ignored. Do yourselves a favour, don't fly Oman air.

### "they cancelled the flight"
My ticket was confirmed to fly on Sun 7th Aug 2022. I was supposed to fly from London Heathrow to Karachi Pakistan via Muscat. I reconfirmed my ticket on the morning of Sat 7th Aug and they confirmed everything is according to schedule. I booked the cab which costed £66 and reached Heathrow. Waited in long queue of check-in and at my turn I was give the luggage tag only for Muscat. I queried this error and it came to my attention that they cancelled the flight and blamed it on Pakistan government declaring the public holiday at last minute. Regardless of this change I was dealt with it and fully cooperated with them, since having an empathy that these things can happen but requested them to store the luggage so I don't have to order a cab on my way back home and on Tue 9th when they rebooked the ticket, but honestly the way their ticket office attendant dealt with me was completely shocking and appalling.

### "absolute wonderful experience"
Not Verified |  Its an absolute wonderful experience with Oman Air for both my out and inbound from LHR to MAA and MAA to LHR via Muscat. All the cabin crew were friendly and very supportive, I'm impressed with a service of crew. Would love to fly Oman Air again and again happily with family.

### "Customer service is appealing bad"
Not Verified | London to Zanzibar via Muscat. They changed my flight and lied about giving me a hotel in a 20 hour layover. Customer service is appealing bad and has been equipped to disappoint you. They have a poor Web form to send feedback that don't work.

### "well maintained, comfortable and clean"
Boeing 737-800 2x2 configuration. Retro style seating was well maintained, comfortable and clean. In-flight entertainment  was comprehensive. In-flight food was delicious. Preflight drink was fresh orange juice, cloudy apple juice or lemon lime mint. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Totally full flight.

### "crew were hospitable and professional"
Boeing 737 Max8 aircraft was in brand new condition. The cabin interior was immaculate. In-flight entertainment 'ARIA' was great. Cabin crew were hospitable and professional. In-flight dining was scrumptious and fresh. Seat was well designed and made good use of space. Highly recommended. I regularly fly Oman Air as I find their business class far superior to other airlines.

### "Oman Air is truly a pleasure to fly"
Boeing 787 aircraft was immaculate. Cabin interior was clean, well maintained and serviced. Cabin crew were polite, professional and friendly. In-flight dining was delicious and well presented. My family and I had a wonderful flight. Oman Air is truly a pleasure to fly. Highly recommend this business class product.

### "cabin crew were friendly and professional"
Not Verified |  The in flight services I experienced on this flight was excellent. The cabin crew were friendly and professional. I was connecting after a long and a tiring journey flying in from Canada with two prior long lay overs. The friendly manner of the cabin crew made me forget my fatigue. The airline did not serve my choice of food and drink. But the crew members were extremely diplomatic in negotiating the substitutes they offered. Please keep up your good work.

### "never met with such bad customer service"
My family was supposed to fly in April 2020 to Muscat from Amman, Jordan on a short holiday trip. Covid struck, airports closed and I spend emailing back and forth with Oman Air for a good year requesting a refund. Their replies would come sometimes a month after I would write them and when it seemed I might just get refunded, I had ridiculous requests like submitting a photo of my expired bank card that I used to purchase the tickets and the like. Needless to say, I was never refunded, silence from Oman Air side for more than 4-5 months. I've never met with such bad customer service as Oman Air. I might still travel to Oman, but for sure I will never book Oman Air again.

### "wait for a year to get my money back"
I have made a business class booking last July 1, 2020 as they were still selling tickets via their website despite their borders being closed. After several cancelations, I have made a refund request and with no options on the table, I have agreed to wait for a year to get my money back. It's been more than 12 months now and I have emailed them last June and still waiting for their reply

### "can get a refund after a year"
In June 2020, we booked a flight to BKK through Oman Air as we were relocating to Thailand. As many others, our flights were cancelled by the airlines due to Covid 19. When we requested a refund, we were told by Oman air that we can get a refund after a year. Now it has been a year since we booked and we are getting absolutely no responses to emails from Oman Air. We do not live in Oman anymore and we can't get hold of anyone in the company to get our money back. What can we do?

### "wait 1 year for the refund"
Booked a flight from Bangkok to Dubai during covid19, June 2020 and the flight got cancelled! I requested a refund! The airline said will contact me back and i have to wait 1 year for the refund. After one year i tried to contact them again and got the email saying that they will get back at me in 15 working days but haven’t heard back. I tried to contact their call center, they said will pass the request for the refund team. It is very frustrating that you can’t talk to anyone and they just let you wait. I hope i get my money back. And will never ever fly with Oman Air again.

### "My first and last experience with Oman Air"
Not Verified |  Booked flights for March 2020. Unable to fly due to covid. Airline offered to extend tickets for max 1 year or a refund. I accepted the offer of flights at the time but covid meant that all flights were grounded until well after the flight date had expired. I contacted Oman Air for a refund and since have had zero response. I have emailed numerous times and made many calls but to no avail. The phone agents keep telling me they are backlogged (understandable) but also tell me that my refund will be processed within 15 days (refund has been verbally agreed). Many 15 days have passed but still no refund. My first and last experience with Oman Air. Would not recommend for the above reasons. As an airline I do not know how good they are as we never got the chance to fly with them.

### "refunded the money for my ticket"
Not Verified |  Oman Air are true to their word they have refunded the money for my ticket in full accordance with their regulations as promised. They are a very trustworthy company. Thank you Oman Air.

### "no refund after one year"
Flight was cancelled due to covid. Still no refund after one year and lots of mails asking a refund. I wont ever book Oman Air again.

### "Oman Air said they would pay it back"
After posting my last message on this site. Oman Air have communicated with me again to ask me for the same information I have sent before. They tell me once again they will answer within 15 days its just playing for time, this is six times now. We had to cancel the flight due to COVID restrictions, we waited the year in accordance with the airlines regulations. Oman Air said they would pay it back in line with their regulations.

### " not responding to my emails"
We book 4 tickets to India on Jan 2020. Unfortunately this coincided with the covid pandemic, and both flights to india and UAE was cancelled. we request for refund but was only offered a rebooking for 2 year/ refund after 1 year of purchase date. Obviously did not expect the pandemic to last this long. The same pandemic situation we book other airline tickets, all airline give back my Money. We agree the airline policy and wait for 1 Year, on Jan 2021, 1 Year was completed, after the one completion on one year i am eligible for the refund, now they are not responding to my emails from last 4 Months. Customer care are saying that contact only e-mail. Visited their Dubai office but no use, no one dont know about their refund, all are saying that contact through e-mail, they are avoiding the e-mails for refund customers. Many times we traveled in Oman Air, now we was facing poor customer service and irresponsibility attitude towards the customer complaint.

### "only offered a rebooking for 1 year"
We flew with Oman Air before the pandemic and the trip was satisfactory. So I had no qualms about booking with them again for my trip to Europe in 2020. Unfortunately this coincided with the covid pandemic, and both flights to and from Europe were cancelled. I was hoping for a refund but was only offered a rebooking for 1 year. Obviously did not expect the pandemic to last this long. At the end of 2020 I felt that this had gone on long enough, and even though they extended the rebooking for 2 years, it was just too hard to make any kind of travel plans. I requested a refund via their website and was met with an email offering rebooking or a travel voucher that could be turned into a refund after 1 year. This is unacceptable to me given the current circumstances, and obviously Oman Air is just trying to buy itself time and hoping customers will give up trying to get a refund. For my Europe trip I had two other flights, one with Air France (refunded immediately) and one with Easyjet (offered a voucher). The fact that A flag carrier like Oman Air is acting more like a budget airline surely affects its prestige. When the world goes back to normal I suspect I will think twice before taking Oman Air ever again.

### "at least 10% of the passengers did not wear any face masks"
Domestic Muscat to Salalah and return on Oman Air in early April. It is not easy to give a star rating for this trip. On the one hand, the two 1h-flights left and arrived on time. Ground handling was swift and friendly throughout, as were the flight attendants. Seats on the 737-800 were reasonably comfortable, and there was a modern touch screen (which I used only for the very good map and flight info functions). On the other hand and unfortunately as usual with Oman Air, cabin announcements were utterly unintelligible. Maybe connected to this, now to the worst: at least 10% of the passengers did not wear any face masks and another quarter or so had them hanging somewhere under the chin. While boarding was still rather civilized, deboarding on both legs was the classical cattle herd movement with pushing and shoving, and certainly as far away as one can imagine from socially distanced row-by-row deboarding. The cabin crews had either given up or did not care. On the day of the return flight, Oman reported new record Covid incidents and ICU occupancy numbers!

### "I finally got full refund"
On February 2020 I booked 4 tickets at omanair.com for the flight to Jakarta on July 2020. Due to corona pandemic they cancelled the flight. Round 2 weeks before the flight date we filled in the refund form and they requested me to wait for 12 months (starting from the purchasing date). After several email exchanged I finally got full refund from Oman Air today (24 march 2021).

### "have refused a refund"
Oman Air cancelled our flights for April last year due to Covid and have refused a refund ever since despite being in breach of EU261. They disputed charge back with Amex and so now got a S75 with them who have been equally bad to deal with. By contrast I have received refunds in full from Finnair, Qatar & Jet2 for cancelled flights.

### "Not sure whether they will refund or drag on"
Not Verified |  I have booked my tickets in Feb-2020 to fly out in July and due to covid the flight got cancelled. When asked for a refund, the Airline assured refund - but only after one year of booking. Now a year has passed and they only keep issuing request number on mails without any official communication. Not sure whether they will refund or drag on.

### "They postponed the refund process"
In January 2020, I bought two round trip tickets from Istanbul to Manila for December 2020. They cancelled the flights and promised me a full refund. They postponed the refund process, wasted my time and energy by employing different time-consuming tactics. Finally, they promised me a refund exactly one year after the issue of the ticket, which was due last January the 21st. It did not happen. What they did was to ask for additional documents. I am disappointed by the way they treated me during this process.

### "Online option for refund does not work"
If you require to make any amendments ie. cancel ticket, change the dates - customer service will not pick up your phone call. After paying extra for a flexible ticket, I've emailed and called about ticket refund for a month now, and no response. Online option for refund does not work.

### "It’s really appalling!"
I called the contact number on their website. The lady that answered seemed very angry. I asked about a refund I have been waiting for for ages. She went like just wait why are you in hurry? I asked if I could speak to someone else who could help, she said no. No one can help you. I called multiple times and every is worse than the other. The last person connected me to a said supervisor. The supervisor hang up to my face. It is both funny and frustrating how they treat their customers. What kind of management do they have? It’s really appalling! At the airport they are just as rude.

### "pathetic and poor service"
Delhi to Muscat flight on December 19th 2020. This time they disappointed me with their service. During the flight I asked many times for water but the crew member didn’t not provide. My flight departure time was 2130hrs and this time they didn’t have dinner. They served only snacks boxes even I am pure vegetarian they didn’t have veg snacks box. I asked from crew member for veg box they said you can have chips and you can drink juice. How can you eat a small packet chips at the time of dinner. I asked for tea/coffee they said only beer we have. I am non alcoholic now tell me how can I drink. Very poor service at this time. You don’t have veg dinner meal, you don’t have water In flight and you are getting water after asking 25 times. Really a pathetic and poor service.

### "ignored any requests for information"
Oman air cancelled my flight due to covid restrictions which is understandable. But they did not inform me it was cancelled luckily I had checked the airport site to see it was cancelled, Oman Air  sent me a email one month later to inform my flight was cancelled. Oman air has mostly ignored any requests for information and refund and if I do receive a reply to emails it takes around a month for a reply and offers no answers to refund requests.

### "Never, ever, travel with them"
Zero stars like many here. Promised refund after 12 months of booking after cancelling a flight due to Covid, but then went into hiding. No reply to e-mails, 12 months have come and gone. But they were able to challenge the charge back that VISA originally authorized, but then had to withdraw again because Oman Air objected. Never, ever, travel with them!

### "don't recommend anyone to fly with Oman Air"
I have booked the tickets in July 2020 then suddenly without any notification, Oman Air has cancelled the flight and refuse to refund us till date. The customer care is dealing with us badly, ignoring our calls and talking with us in rude language. I don't recommend anyone to fly with Oman Air.

### "refusing to refund flights"
Outbound flight was really average. Food is not good, the flight attendants are sluggish and quite rude with customers if you dare asking too many questions, cabin and toilets cleanliness was also quite low. Inbound flight never happened. They have never reimbursed my cancelled return flights since last March. Customer service is non existent and they are refusing to refund flights which were cancelled by them for operational reasons, while in reality it was just a lack of passengers for this flight.

### "up to one year they refund us"
We never flew with this airline as they canceled our tickets due to COVID-19 outbreak. We requested full refund as the flight was cancelled by the airline but they never processed our request and they suggested it would take up to one year they refund us. Based on their policy at the time of booking our tickets, they supposed to refund us within 15 days and when I called their helpless callcenter they confirmed it would take 20 days at most to have our money back. It's already three month passed since we requested for refund and yet we haven't heard back from them.

### "refund my money after 1 year"
Our Flight got canceled due to the COVID 19. Initially they promised to refund our money immediately refund form submit through travel agency. After 90 days of refund request, Oman Airlines advised that they have changed the policy and will refund my money after 1 year of the purchase date of my ticket. We have spent $11000 a year go and still waiting for Oman Air to answer my phone calls. Air Asia refunded our money after 3 months of refund request.

### "refunding tickets will be processed only after 1 year"
Since the beginning of this pandemic they stopped answering their phone calls, only automated replies via emails. Is there any one knows any other airline told their customers that refunding their tickets will be processed only after 1 year of the issuing date. Is this even legal ?

### "didn’t refund my return my half ticket"
I went to Pakistan and there were lockdown and I spent £2300 to come back on different air line. Oman air didn’t refund my return my half ticket, no one reply on any platform or phone call. They don’t know what to do very disoriented with Oman air. Our agent said Oman air not replying his email, I rang and email them with my ticket as well - never get any answer from Oman air. I will never use Oman air again until they resolve my half ticket issue and I paid £2300 on top to get back home in uk

### "3 months later still no refund"
Disgraceful company. Booked flights for April which were cancelled by the airline. Refund applied for in May and 3 months later still no refund. Their approach to the pandemic appears to be sticking their head in the sand and pretending it's not happening. I've flown them before and they certainly weren't bad but not in the same league as other middle Eastern carriers. I would never recommend them to anyone after this though, no matter how cheap the flights. Terrible, terrible airline.

### "I cannot recommend them"
Due to the Covid-19 crisis they cancelled the flights we had booked. However despite months and months of contacting them they have refused to issue any refunds. After struggling with them they finally agreed to allow us to re-book our flights for the same time the following year explaining that we would simply need to pay any additional cost of seats available. As the flights for the same time next year had been made available online through travel agents and direct on Omanair.com I explained I would like to undertake the rescheduling now so that I could secure my reschedule and avoid paying a higher cost when there was less availability. The airline explained that they would not allow me to reschedule my flights until Muscat Airport was fully reopened. Yet they would allow new passengers to book flights via travel agents and direct on their website. I explained to customer services that this was unfair and meant that I may not be able to take them up on the reschedule they have offered me and would have to pay an inflated price if availability was later limited. They advised that it was their rule. They have continued to offer ever more frequent “special flights” but without committing to allowing people to reschedule their previously cancelled flights. Having been a frequent user of Emirates, Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways, and with this being my first experience of Oman Air I cannot recommend them in anyway. Stop playing games and making false promises. Please give me my money back or let me reschedule my flights.

### "only will refund in 12 months"
Oman Air only will refund in 12 months after the ticket was issued even if the flight is cancelled by the airline!! I have booked for a flight Doha-KL via Muscat on 10 June 2020 and OA has cancelled the flight due to Covid-19. First they says as a goodwill, they are offering a rebooking at no extra charges but only fare difference will be applicable (if any) and for the cash refund they can do it but only after 12 months as per the company policy! The goodwill they are offering is not a goodwill as the ticket category I book allow rebooking at any time so it is not a “goodwill”. What happen if my new ticket is of a lower value? Will they refund it? No It is not stated in their website or in the ticket term and condition that state the 12 months refund. I will be surprised if what they are doing is considered lawful or approve by any aviation authority. Many airlines are going through trouble time but to do this will only affect their future business more than now. When everything is back to normal no one will ever trust or want to use their service again. I am for sure one of them.

### "tactics to confuse us and ignore us"
Not Verified | Our flight was cancelled due to COVID-19 but we were never notified by the airline- I only found out because I called before the flight to check on my flight status. They told us to contact the 'Websalesrefund' email address requesting a refund but we have only received automated responses that are ambiguous, such as 'We offer to keep your flight open'. We believe that we are eligible for a refund however we have not received any clear guidance on if we can get a refund or how we can access credit. The call centre tells us to email, and the email responses tell us to call. It has been almost two months and I don't know if we will ever get our money back. All the other airlines that we had bookings with in May and June (such as Vueling, Scoot and Easyjet) have given us refunds. Oman is the only airline that has used tactics to confuse us and ignore us. Unless we are given assurance that we will receive our refund or credit, I will never fly Oman Air and will not recommend it.

### "complete and utter disgrace"
Oman Air is, quite simply, a complete and utter disgrace. The airline treats its guests with complete contempt. Flights from Amman to Muscat and back were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and they are refusing to refund, instead keeping my money (and that of countless other customers) when planes did not even take off. The airline has adopted a policy of hoping customers will stop pestering them so they can keep their money without providing a service. They refuse to help on the phone (or hang up on you) and direct you to an e-mail address. An automatic reply to all e-mails says you may have to wait 15 days for a reply. If you get a reply, they do not help or address any questions you have asked. It is just a copy and paste response. When you reply again, you get the same automatic message saying to wait 15 days. It is a system which seems like it has been purposely designed to annoy and frustrate. I specifically put several times I did not want a voucher or to keep the ticket open, and requested a full refund as is my legal right. This was repeatedly ignored as they kept offering to keep the ticket open. On one occasion I was told to fill out an online form to process my refund. I did this, and eventually got a reply again offering me to keep the ticket open. They eventually said that as per their terms and conditions, I would be paid 12 months after the tickets were booked. So they want to use people's money as an interest free loan. I asked several times where in the terms and conditions it says this and was repeatedly ignored. The reason for this is it is not in the terms and conditions. I also have no faith they will repay the money after this time. I was really looking forward to visiting Oman but my impression of the country is now permanently damaged because of the airline which represents them.

### "Absolutely horrendous"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrendous. Canceled our return flight. Didn't tell us. Waited at airport until 5am dealing with staff. They ordered us a taxi home, which never came. Returned to desk to find they had closed. Finally offered compensation in February, to which I agreed, and no correspondence since. Do not fly with this airline. They caused huge distress, showed no customer care whatsoever, and essentially lied about compensation. Never ever again.

### "appalling company policy for refunds"
Most appalling company policy for refunds especially covid-19 related ones. You can not talk to an actual human being it is all done by email or online submission where you just get a stock response of a future travel voucher. I had 9 separate requests over 3 months go back & forth where I refused the voucher. They then said I could do a full cash refund but will only refund it after 12 months of the booking date. What type of awful company does that? In the end I got my credit card company to issue a chargeback against them which took 2 weeks. Luckily I’ll never have to deal with Oman Air again

### "no satisfying customer service"
Jakarta to Frankfurt via Muscat. Most ridiculous airline in the crisis, no satisfying customer service or refund / rebooking policies in place. Avoid this airline.

### "no response about my ticket refund"
London to Hyderabad via Muscat. My Flight was cancelled and its been more than a month now, that I have received no response from Oman air about my ticket refund. Wrote 15 emails, called customer care 20 times, No response. When you speak with Customer care, they refuse to listen to the customer and hang up. I have not received any proper response from any one in Oman air. On the Website and on the Internet, they publish stories, saying that they will refund the amount but they won't reply you even on Social Media.

### "Comfortable seats, very clean cabin"
Zurich to Bangkok via Muscat. Good handling at online booking with seat selection. For online check-in the seats were not available any more, so we selected other seats. Good service on bagage drop/check-in. Good flight service on the route ZRH to MCT. Rich choice of amenities (amenity bag and pijama), blankets for the flat bed seat. Good choice of food, very good selection of drinks. Very good service on the flight MCT to BKK. Good choice of food and very good selection of drinks. Comfortable seats, very clean cabin.

### "a $175 cancellation fee"
I have been trying to get hold of this organisation to get a refund for a cancelled flight. They advised that there would be a $175 cancellation fee which I accepted. They have now retracted and not responding to any of my emails or phone calls. I have completed an online complaint twice and emailed 16 different offices around the world to get a response. If you want to get a feel for this airline go to their facebook page and see some of the comments. What they are doing contravenes their fare rules and T&C's.

### "Appalling customer service"
Not Verified |  Dubai to Nairobi via Muscat. Appalling customer service. When other airlines are trying to help customers, Oman Air are not interested. Rude staff on telephone, charging for rebooking after saying they won't, refusing to refund. They are so busy on Facebook telling everyone how great they are but when it comes to after they have taken your money they are not interested. I will never use them again.

### "I would never use them again"
Dubai to Bangkok via Muscat. We was due to fly to Thailand for my 60th Birthday, but due to the Corvid 19 situation the flights got cancelled. I have been dealing with Oman Air Sales refund team since 18 March 2020, despite the tickets being Business class ticket, I have not been offered a refund only that we can re-book the tickets within 18 Months. I have refused this offer due to that it was for a special occasion, but dealing with there customer care and being told to make a complaint through their on-line service (3 Times) numerous phone call etc. I am still offered the same ( No Refund). The worst Airline I have ever dealt with! I would never use them again.

### "I asked for refund"
Not Verified |  The flight got cancelled and the online checkin was still working and no one informed me so I had to drive 2 hrs to airport and back from airport after knowing it has been cancelled. I asked for refund since its mentioned in their website but they kept offering me reschedule flight within 18 months. I explained to them it is irrelevant for me anymore but I keep getting the same message as it’s an auto reply. I called and everyone say it not our responsibility submit online complaint.

### "refused to refund me"
Nairobi to Islamabad via Muscat. I booked a flight with refundable option with Oman air before the COVID-19 started. Due to a family emergency, I had to cancel this flight. Oman air has refused to refund me the funds (minus the penalty). They keep insisting that they can extend my ticket deadline without penalty for 18 months, which does not work for me as I won't be flying this route anymore, but they have refused. Any suggestions on how to get my money back from Oman air?

### "no response for my Refund"
Not Verified |  Dubai to Manila via Muscat. Poor customer service. They focus only on profit not passenger. They cancel my flight without notice or inform me. So I send email requesting refund but until now no refund happen. Its has been a month but still no response for my Refund. I will not recommend this airline anymore.

### "Terrible service"
Not Verified |  Dubai to Bangkok. Oman Air has canceled the flight and still has not refunded the ticket amount. They arranged a call once and then nothing after that. No reply to emails or to the feedback on their website as the person in the call has suggested. Terrible service and never want to use this airline again.

### "I expected I would be refunded"
Dubai to Bangkok via Muscat. They cancelled my flight a week or so before I was due to fly due to the virus outbreak. I expected I would be refunded, but instead I received a barrage of confusing emails and text messages. I tried calling but the customer service agent was rude and refused to help me, instead directing me to a specific email address. I emailed as instructed, and they finally replied around 2 weeks later saying they will rebook my flights at a later date. This does not help me as the wedding I was travelling to attend has been permanently cancelled. I have no need for the flights anymore so simply want a refund. Upon requesting this they have now advised me to 'leave feedback on the website'! Seriously!? How is that meant to get me my money back? I will never book with Oman Air again. I have visited the beautiful country more than a dozen times but this experience has permanently damaged my view of what is otherwise a lovely culture. What a disgrace.

### "not fair in such a crisis"
Not Verified |  I want to thank Oman air for charging extra ‘as per the ticket policy’ in such a situation. All UAE borders are closed my flight supposed to be on Sunday 22nd  March, I called to extend my stay the contact center agent said I have to pay the change fees 13 Omani rial. This is totally ridiculous and not fair in such a crisis.

### "lost a regular life long user"
London to Muscat via Bangkok. Always used to use this company to fly. I won't again. The airline cancels 1 flight 3 days before departure then book me on another without my consent 17-hour stopover in Oman, which currently has a travel ban in the UK. Then the airline cancels another of my flights 2 days before departure and again rebook me on another without my consent The cancellation and rebooking without my consent also caused my travel insurance to become void so can no longer travel regardless. No refund or compensation offered and fobbed off. This virus will pass. People's memories won't. You've lost a regular life long user of your airline. Such a shame.

### "Hopeless online check-in"
Delhi to Manchester via Muscat. Hopeless online check-in procedure. On checking in for our flight (less than 48 hours from departure) we could not check in without paying extra for the privilege of seat selection. No one at the airports could explain why this was the case and advised I contacted customer services. I've done this via email and directly on the web site, but 3 weeks later have still not got any response from the airline.

### "I don’t recommend"
Terrible experience, I don’t recommend. I lost my bag on flight no 406 from Cairo to Muscat, I spent 4 days there with no clothes or any of my stuff, the bag is still missing. Every employee I talk to try to prove that it’s not his fault instead of acting like one team representing a big brand.

### "Very good service"
Bangkok to Cairo via Muscat with Oman Air. Very good service and departed on time every time. Very good food. Staff were good. On the other hand, it was hard to find the check-in kiosk at Bangkok Airport. Price was a bit high.

### "I was very impressed"
Just flew Oman Air Business class from Casablanca to Kuala Lumpur via Muscat and I was very impressed. Everything went absolutely smoothly, no delay, nothing ! Had a 13 hours transit lay-over in MCT and was offered a hotel room but prefered to stay in the wonderful lounge; the attendants mostly Filipinos were extremely courteous and service friendly and even recognized me on my return flight and the place is so clean ! Great flights with very comfortable and private seating; appreciated the old style Biz class on their A330 on the MCT-KUL route, not so private as on the 787 but very confy. Great choice and variety of food and drinks, the best soups I had ever had on a plane. Very friendly attendants. It was definitely a bargain and will try to repeat the experience in the very near future! Thank you Oman Air.

### "experience is very basic!"
Casablanca to Kuala Lumpur via Muscat. One of the worst airlines on the planet! Unreliable! They cancelled our flight and delayed it 2 days, no apology no nothing, they didn't even inform us, we had to check to see the change! Very bad service, it's nearly impossible to contact them, and when you do, they are extremely unprofessional, they can't help with anything but waste your time on the phone. The flight experience is very basic! All on all I don't recommend! Their prices are not that different from similar airlines like Qatar or Etihad so it's better to fly with them! You have to pay for WiFi! Even some budget airlines have free WiFi!

### "Very good food"
Bangkok to Cairo via Muscat with Oman Air. Very good service and departed on time every time. Very good food. Staffs were good. On the other hand, it was hard to find out check-in kiosk at Bangkok airport. Price was a bit high.

### "Appalling treatment"
Appalling treatment following cancelled flights and no customer service response. We travelled from London to Colombo over the Christmas period. We booked our tickets earlier in the year and paid a premium to fly back on Saturday 4 January and ensured the flights had one short stopover as we were travelling with 2 small children and 2 elderly grandparents. Oman cancelled part of our flight on the way over and put us on a 2 stopover flight which added an extra 6 hour delay to arrival time and inconvenience at the additional stopover in the Maldives. Oman cancelled the entire return journey on 4 January and the next available flight provided was on 7 January but did not inform us that was a 2 stopover flight! Despite paying a premium for a Saturday one stop flight and getting transferred onto a Tuesday 2 stop flight, no compensation has been accepted. The complaints service are non responsive and simply do no respond to a complaint. We will never be flying with Oman again!

### "bags a week after my arrival"
Melbourne to Tehran via Muscat/Abu Dhabi. I received my bags a week after my arrival in Tehran because they engaged another airline (Etihad) to do the first part of the journey, my bags were held in Abu Dhabi the staff in Tehran were rude and unhelpful trying to avoid accepting the responsibility. I think this company is far from being an international professional airline, they are known for missing bags. The second issue was the extremely expensive cost of rebooking a flight once you miss one flight it cost me $1300 Australian dollars to rebook my flight from Abu Dhabi to Melbourne

### "Service was pleasant throughout"
Hyderabad to Muscat. Check in was simple, lounge pass was pre-prepared and staff was assigned to escort me through security. She told me she would return later to collect me at the lounge. Lounge at Hyderabad is common to all airlines and a pretty uninspiring place but on this occasion a young man was extremely attentive, serving me all I could ask for at my seat. I was among the last to board and was pleased that despite the full economy cabin the business class storage had not been encroached. On the 737-900 seating was 2+2 in a 12 seater cabin that was half full. We pushed back 3 minutes early and between then and the point of take off I was offered a hot or cold towel, a choice of lemon or melon juice (alcohol is not served on the ground in India), an Arabic coffee and fresh dates. Once in the air a menu was quickly presented. Slightly disappointing unless you happen to be a passionate fan of Hyderabadi food which the majority of passengers were and only one starter and dessert (see menu card). From the three mains I opted for the fish but requested it after one hour of the three hour journey. The menu listed only soft drinks but after I clarified a bar was available, I requested a gin (brand not evident) and tonic (served with no lemon or lime and little ice). This came with a small half full bowl of nuts that seemed flavoured with salt and vinegar. Before dinner I enquired about the wine selection. Two uninspiring mini bottles of red and white that I have had on economy in the past in other routes were offered, so I asked about Champaign and took this option. When it was poured out of my sight a stewardess came to apologise it was not chilled and offered ice - an unlikely combination. I was assured a second bottle was being chilled and this later transpired to be so. Dinner comprised a simple salad without dressing and fish which was cooked perfectly but came with accompaniments that were not hugely to my taste, and an Indian desert which, as is usually so, too sweet for my liking. Service was pleasant throughout and the IFE, criticised in some reviews as lacking choice, more than met my expectation.

### "2nd time my luggage is delayd"
Bahrain to Kuala Lumpur via Muscat, this is the 2nd time my luggage is delayed, really causing a lot of lost time. Overall the flight is good, but the connection is very tight, no much for passenger to choose.

### "impressed with everything"
Casablanca to Muscat. I was impressed with everything about Oman Air. This was our third flight after our two legs going to Europe and this the first returning home to Australia. The service was excellent on all legs and the food was some of the best airline food I have had. The business class seat is all you could want and I managed 5 hours sleep. There was a great selection of wine and other beverages.

### "Boeing 787 was comfortable"
Manchester to Colombo via Muscat. I was not impressed with the on-line checkin experience. I was given error messages suggesting I try later, and this was the only advice given when I telephoned them. Eventually I tried with Chrome instead of Firefox and everything worked: however, you cannot check in online unless you choose and pay for a seat (and if you are willing to pay to reserve a seat you can do that as soon as you have bought your ticket). So I checked in at a desk at the airport: I was not asked to pay anything but was not given a choice of seat. (I was given a window seat for the first sector; an aisle seat for the second leg, but both of these were towards the rear of the aircraft.) The lounge provided for premium class passengers at Manchester is only the Aspire lounge, which is OK but pretty basic. Food for the Manchester to Muscat sector was generous and acceptable (apart from a horrible sausage roll for breakfast! ), but somewhat lacking in flavour. Service was incredibly slow: I think I began eating my supper at around 11 at night (departure time scheduled for 20.05). One poor woman was desperate for the toilet but the food trolley would not let her get past for a prolonged period. On the Muscat to Colombo sector we were served a spicy and delicious fish curry, but the woman next to me could not tolerate the spices and there was no alternative (we were near the rear and all the vegetarian lunches had been given out already). The real star was the infight entertainment: a broad selection of intelligent films from Europe; Iran and other cultures, many of which were recent releases. There were also TV series and Hollywood or Bollywood rubbish for those so inclined, as well as a wide range of interesting music. (Unfortunately the listening conditions with the roar of the engines made musical appreciation impossible, even using my own noise-cancelling headphones. The earphones provided in economy were of good quality but obviously not noise-cancelling.) Oh: the coffee was very sad. Maybe it is time that some Middle Eastern airlines shared this aspect of their culture with all their passengers. My seat on the Boeing 787 was comfortable, with just enough space. On the 737 I was rather cramped, even in an aisle seat (and I am not particularly large).

### " Excellent service throughout"
My first experience of Oman Air. Having secured the flight and upgrade for a fraction of the price charged by UAE-based carriers, albeit not the quickest with an overnight at Kuala Lumpur, I was wary given some of the reviews. No issues! The first surprise: an upgrade for the short hop to Muscat. Nice touch. The A330 for the KUL leg was a little long in the tooth, as was the business class cabin; bland and tatty in places. However the 1-2-1 configuration ensured space aplenty, and the seats were comfortable enough if lacking privacy. Excellent service throughout, the pre-ordered vegetarian particularly good. The IFE and drinks selection somewhat limited compared to others but that's a minor gripe. Other than an hour's delay the onward connection with Malindo Air from KUL in economy was uneventful, my Oman Air ticket including a meal.

### "big mistake choosing Oman Air"
Manchester to Bangalore via Muscat. I made a big mistake of choosing Oman Air. I booked a flight on 24th June 2019 to fly from Manchester to Bangalore on 4th December 2019 paying full price. When I tried to check in online I had to pay £12 for the seat. There were no free seats offered and without choosing the seat and paying for it I couldn't check in online. I chose Asian veg meal which was hopeless. My connecting flight had no individual tv that you normally have with most Middle East and Asian Airlines. When I was returning from India I had to pay 1484 Indian rupees for the seat to check in online. 5Asian veg meal had a kind of parata that was so dry without anything to go with it. On second flight meal, I had a cheap butter without any bread, dessert whilst others had lurpak, bread role and nice dessert. So when you compare the price online keep in mind all these extra charges and never chose Asian veg meal. I would never book with this airline in the future.

### "the most shambolic airline"
London to Karachi via Muscat. Oman Air are the most shambolic airline I have ever flown with. I booked flights a little over a month prior to travel. Less than three weeks later I was sent a text informing me that my connecting flight had been cancelled. The text contained no additional information about whether my flight would be rescheduled or if I would have to rebook onto another flight, causing me great stress. I was required to call the airline to discover this and received no apology whatsoever. I was eventually booked onto another flight, leaving me with a 12-hour layover in Muscat as a lone female traveller. I contested this and received no direct response, but was sent through a further flight confirmation transferring me to a flight a day later. Not having been consulted, this conflicted with my travel plans and so I was forced to call again, eventually securing a hotel for the lengthy layover. They sent no email confirmation of this provision other than a single line on my flight details, which offered little comfort given their performance thus far. A day prior to my flight I attempted to check in online. Although I had paid a substantial fee for seat allocation on all flights when I initially booked, this was not reflected in the most recent flight confirmation. The airline attempted to charge me an additional fee to check in on the outgoing journey. I reluctantly chose to pay this and seek refund at the airport given the poor customer service I had received through their phone line. However, I was told by a rather surly woman at the customer service desk that I would need to call to resolve the issue, which was less than ideal given I was about to board an international flight. Upon arrival in Muscat I was initially denied the hotel I had been promised. I was required to speak to a number of people and only secured the room with the support of another customer who had also been booked on the cancelled flight from London. I have never received such abysmal service from any airline. I have encountered not one but three issues which have caused me great stress, been arduous to resolve and for which I have received no apology or compensation. I would emphatically urge all against booking with Oman Air.

### "After 4 days, no response"
Tehran to Kuala Lumpur via Muscat, onward to Singapore by Malaysia Airlines booked for the end of December. As a new student in Singapore with an approved IPA letter (which is the common long-term student VISA in Singapore and permission entry), I was eligible to buy one-way ticket. I sent my IPA letter to the OmanAir agent in Tehran IKA two weeks prior to my flight in order to have hassle-free connections. This type of visa was new for staff, hence they investigated from Malaysia office and surprisingly he responded they do not let you get on the plane, consequently we cannot let you boarding from Tehran unless you buy a return ticket as well. Many students have flown one-way to Singapore without any problems using their IPA letters with various airlines such as Emirates, Qatar Airways directly and even Oman Air. t I was totally stressed and I am now as the case is still under investigation. After 4 days, no response. I asked their chat system to remind them about my urgent case, but they only answered with formality pre-written answers each time that they will contact you as soon as possible. After about 6 days, I called their call centre and they said the customer support department does not have telephones and you should wait for email. Day 6 finished and I decided to post my review here and let people like me to make a wiser decision for their flights. They advertise a lot but they are not at all cooperative. My issue could be resolved with a correct correspondence between two airlines, but they are too slow or not willing to do so as even my agency agreed that I can travel one-way and even Malaysia Airlines knew IPA letter on the phone.

### "actually very pleased"
Full Christmas flight in economy Frankfurt to Muscat. I couldn’t fault them, actually very pleased. Friendly & attentive crew, regular drinks rounds (alcohol included), main meal plus snack, plus extra drinks if wanted. Media selection fine, sound quality with headphones provided not that great - but that’s the only criticism other than one toilet (I’ll spare the details).

### "I miss my original flight"
Doha to Manchester via Muscat. My flight from Manchester was delayed, upon asking Oman Air about my connection flight to Doha from Muscat. They told me it would not be delayed because captain would make up the time, during flight no confirmation or no announcement that people would miss connecting flight. Upon arrival at Muscat, it was very difficult to find out my next flight. We were give a breakfast voucher which only worth it for cup of coffee or cheap burger. I miss my original flight and because of that I arrived very late in Doha and as a consequence missed very important meeting in Doha.

### "not even received a response"
Jaipur to Bahrain via Muscat. My original flight was cancelled and I was put onto a flight the next day - since this did not work for me, the least I expected was some assistance - but not a single customer service representative could help and I am still going back and forth with them as I type this review (2 weeks after my flight!). The last 4 communications have not even received a response and when I try to call, they say you can only email us for this issue. Never going to deal with them again.

### "a cut back in service"
Manchester to Muscat. This was my 5th flight this year with Oman Air in Business. As usual friendly and professional staff. Amenity kit and pyjamas provided. What I did notice was what appeared to be a cut back in service. Pre take off not offered champagne - just water or juice. In terms of drinks service it was very slow and had 1 glass of wine for flight. Food was OK. This was an overnight flight so not really bothered about much alcohol but with most overnight flights you do get some breakfast, however light. None on this flight though. I got a great sleep - seat made all the more comfortable with great mattress topper. For that there is still high marks but I am starting to wonder if costs now being cut. I do hope this small friendly airline with great service does not go the way of Etihad - an airline we always used but now avoid.

### "service on flight not so good"
Dubai to Salalah. The service on the flight was not so good. Crew did not seem at all interested in serving passengers. They need to be more professional in their behaviour.

### "flight was a pleasant one"
Chennai to Doha via Muscat. My journey started off with a hassle where i had to explain the check in agent that Indians are allowed to fly to Qatar on Visa on Arrival and that Debit Cards also stand valid for acceptance by the Qatari Authorities. The Chennai check in agent was not at all helpful and held me up till the last and didn't give me my boarding pass as he wasn't sure sure about it even though i was literally the first person in the queue to check in. Other than that my flight was a pleasant one, with good service by the cabin crew and delicious inflight meals. The IFE was also good with good variety of options to choose from. Will definitely recommend this airline to flyers and hope that you get reasonable check in agents.

### "Service was very attentive"
Muscat to Paris. Passengers started boarding while aircraft was still refuelling and therefore could not use any mobile device on board. Cabin had not been precooled and was hot and stale, it took about 30 minutes to cool down to a comfortable temperature. Cabin crew offered drinks and coffee as soon as I settled down to my seat. Service was very attentive and efficient during the flight and food was very good. Wine list is short but carefully selected (Sancerre deserves a special mention and should hopefully remain a long time on the list.) IFE worked without any problems but I found my remote control less reactive than usual. A smooth landing at CDG, on time, concluded a near perfect flight.

### "Service was attentive throughout"
Bangkok to Bangkok via Muscat. A pleasant afternoon flight leaving and arriving on time. Choice of 3 main courses (but no fish). My choice of beef was tasty. Service was attentive throughout the flight. A lot of new movies in comparison to my last flight on this route 3 weeks ago. As a frequent flyer with Oman Air, I will rate this particular trip as above average.

### "They increased the transit time "
Not Verified |  Frankfurt to Colombo via Muscat. Oman air rescheduled both ongoing and return flight. No reason was given. They increased the transit time in Muscat to 8 hours from 4 hours initially. They did not offer accomodation but offered a meal voucher. For people traveling from Asia to north america with an 18-20 hour flight time, the added transit time of 8 hours or more is very tiring. Meal vouchers are not needed then, passengers prefer to rest instead of loitering the airport. I doubt anyone in Oman Air cares as customer service to passengers is not their priority unfortunately.

### "cabin staff were very good"
Bangkok to London via Muscat. A very good flight. Check in was fast and efficient. The flights took off and landed on time with a brief was a brief stop in Muscat to change planes for the leg to London. There were the customary hot towels and drinks on boarding on both flights. The cabin staff were very good. The seat easily changed to a comfortable but relatively narrow flat bed and I was able to have good sleeps on both sectors. The choice of food was good and the portion size was more than adequate. When I arrived in London my luggage was waiting for me (I had got through Immigration very quickly and was surprised to find that my luggage was already there.

### "we were denied boarding"
Delhi to Dubai via Muscat. Some passengers were not allowed to board and they mentioned that apparently the UAE government had issued a new rule saying that a minor difference in the place of birth between the visa and the passport. And even though the passport number matched with the visa we were denied boarding. We were able to fly with the same visa on he next day via flyDubai  without any issue.

### "limited leg room but I liked the PTV"
Flew Muscat-Salalah return and there are only two options of which Oman Air turned out to be a good one. Our flight to Salalah was very punctual. Boeing 737 had limited leg room but I liked the PTV, which Oman even has on shorthaul flights. Attentive crew, nice snack and an early landing on both in and outbound flight. Leg room in Embraer 175 much better. Ground staff rather grumpy. Some of them must hate their jobs.

### "refused to offer compensation"
Muscat to Manila. A 12-hour delay with no explanation. Informed of rescheduling just 4 hours before the flight. Rescheduled and cancelled again. Despite missing connecting flights they refused to offer compensation. The support desk staff at Muscat Airport couldn't care less.

### "experience  was superb"
Manchester to Dubai return via Muscat. From checking in at Manchester to disembarking again at Manchester, our experience with Oman Air was superb. The staff were outstanding in their service. The planes were comfortable, though on the outward journey one toilet was a bit unclean. Muscat airport was great - new and clean. The only issue we had were the security staff on our return leg. My husband had knee replacement so has metal pins. He explained this to security guard who was rude and unprofessional and kept demanding paperwork for surgery. At the boarding gate all passengers were subjected once more to full check, at which point a group of these guards were deliberately embarrassing a young European lad travelling.

### "seat belt signs were not switched on"
The seat belt signs were not switched on during the approach to Kuala Lumpur. I reported this to the captain who verified that the cabin indicators were working. I did not see cabin crew check for loose objects in the cabin before landing. Good service, good food, but safety should be the number 1 priority. This is a rapidly expanding airline with first class planes and service with competitive fares. Their ground service is struggling to keep up.

### "the service was excellent"
London Heathrow to Kathmandu via Muscat. Genuinely surprised at how good Oman Air were. The flights were at least £150 (each) cheaper than other airlines so we expected the worst, but the service was excellent, the plane was modern and clean and the crew were largely attentive, although the meal service was fairly slow. The inflight entertainment system was good with a decent range of films, music and TV including Western, Bollywood and Arabic. The food was tasty, hot and appropriate for a flight to Oman (ie Middle Eastern influences.) Even if we hadn't paid a bargain basement fare I would have been happy with the flight(s), Oman are easily comparable with their middle eastern rivals and we will use them again next year. As an aside, Seeb airport is about as good as airports get for a transfer flight - it is spotlessly clean and modern, security was seamless, there are lots of comfortable, huge sofas to lounge around on whilst waiting for your flight and you can use the wifi and charging points for free.

### "I was not happy at all"
Kozhikode to Madina via Muscat. I had the Sindbad membership as well from the last 5 trips. Unfortunately I was not happy at all some of the crew members attitude. I had two way tickets from Madina/CCJ and it mentioned two pcs baggage are allowed. So i thought at least 40kg entitled under my tickets. once i kept my baggage in the waiting scale the staff told me you are entitled to carry only 30kg and for the deferment 10kg I might pay additional INR/7,000, I have no way except throw those extra items. Second thing i am a newly join Oman Air Sindbad membership but i don't feel any consideration or upgrades for the members while there was many empty seats was free near to exit door and business class. I missed my apple air pod near to seat number F23 between the trip Muscat To Madina and requested to the crew to allow me just two minutes to search on it before leaving the aircraft. Unfortunately they said it is not allowed and we don't find anything from your seats. Once i went to claim my case to lost and found center in Madina they said go to information counter. From information counter they said go to lost and found counter. Finally i thought no one have supporting mind and i will not get it back again from this kind of people .

### "unaware of Oman Air policy"
Oman Air customer service is non-existent. In June I flew to Muscat with Oman Air business class. I traveled with my Bicycle in a purpose made case. However when I checked in for my return flight at Zurich Airport I was told that despite having a baggage allowance of 100 kg and despite my bike bag weighing less than 30 kg I would not be permitted to check in my bike unless I paid 348 Swiss Francs. At the time of booking my flight I was unaware of Oman Air policy of charging extra for “sports equipment” excluding golf clubs. I was told “If you do not pay your bike will stay in Zurich and you will bear any costs”. Rather than have my bike confiscated I paid the 348CHF. In the lounge I checked Oman Air’s web site and although it was not immediately apparent it did say that other than the golf club exclusion I could be charged $US120 to take my bike with me. This is approximately three times what I was charged. I made a complaint and filled out the form on the website on my return to Australia. I heard nothing for two days so I contacted Oman Air and was told the matter was being investigated. After a week of no contact I made contact again and was asked for the number of my claim. I take this to mean that there had been no follow up at all. Despite numerous attempts I am yet to hear anything.

### "got a flight on Singapore Airlines"
Riyadh to Singapore: Flight WY 682 RUH-MCT (Delay) Flight WY 849 MCT-CGK (Delay) Flight WY 5836 CGK-SIN (Not Boarding) Change to Singapore Airlines Flight SQ967 The Flight from Muscat to Jakarta arrived at 14:05 (local time)-The transfer assistance inform us that flight to Singapore was no longer boarding. Problem Airport Transfer information: 1st- Promise us put on the next flight at 18:15 (not happen), 2nd- Promise next flight at 18:50 (also did not happen), 3rd- After some pressure from the 23 passengers, who did not board, the airport agents (transition zone) there got a flight on Singapore Airlines at 20:20 4rd-Finally we arrived at destination (Singapore) at 11:00 local time. To be noted: Oman Air agent not appeared or assisted the 23 passenger including several children and woman: 6 hours waiting at the airport, No water and food and Sited on the floor.

### "I would hesitate to recommend"
Not Verified |  In February, I had booked seats for the three sectors of my business class return from UK to Australia: London to Muscat, Muscat to Kuala Lumpur and Kuala Lumpur to Adelaide. The final sector was ticketed by Oman Air but the provider was Malaysia Airlines. On arrival at Kuala Lumpur Airport after a two night stop-over, I was informed that my seat on the flight of 27th July was no longer available even though my travel agent had confirmed it on 25th July. I was given the option of waiting for a business class seat on the flight on 31st July or downgrade to economy on the 27th; as I needed to be back in Adelaide by 28th, I was forced to accept the economy option. No apologies have been offered by Oman Air and I have been informed that it could be more than 12 weeks before my claim for compensation is dealt with. I am appalled that such a situation could arise without any consultation from Oman Air. The sectors on which I flew with Oman Air were very good, but the experience of the downgrade means that I would hesitate to recommend this outfit to anybody else.

### "Worst customer experience"
Kuala Lumpur to Paris CDG via Muscat. After losing my luggage for 5 days plus 2 days due to 6 hour delay in KL which led to overnight delay in Muscat, customer service wrote to me, falsely claiming that I agreed to compensation for 3 days of €120 when nothing was said before! There was no info, no transparency when I rang baggage claim and customer service multiple times a day. They claimed they found my bag in Muscat when I landed in Paris CDG, and they were just waiting for the next flight to Paris, there is one flight per day to Paris. I could not understand why it took them 5 days! Worst customer experience in my life!

### "Friendly crew"
7h night flight from Muscat to Frankfurt on Oman Air. Internet check-in flawless, baggage drop off in MCT rather slow. Passport and security check busy but reasonably swift. Flight left and arrived on time. Seats were very decent for eco. My screen was frozen and could not be restarted despite of several attempts by the crew. Although the flight was almost full the purser managed to find me an alternative seat with functional IFE. Friendly crew. The snack after midnight as well as the breakfast were below previous Oman Air standards.

### "Great flight"
Manila to Amman via Muscat with Oman Air. Great flight! Seats were comfortable and the food delicious. Service was friendly, professional and personal but could have some more improvements. Beyond that, a great flight.

### "should have used another air service"
Bangalore to Moscow via Muscat. I have a flight booked from Bangalore to Muscat which leaves at 10:10 AM and reaches Muscat at 12:10 PM. After a 2 hour layover I have a connecting flight. This was the original plan, when Oman air decided to cancel my first flight and reschedule me for another later flight, which makes me miss my connecting flight. Upon asking, the customer service told me to just wait in the airport for 18 hours on the flight date and they will arrange the next day's connecting flight. No accommodation nothing, just sit and wait at the airport is what I got as response. Upon asking if I could get a full refund since its their problem, they have 0% refund policy even if they make the mistake. And I got an option to select the next day's flights instead of the delayed day. And they are not sure if this will be disrupted as well. I have a feeling this is going to be one bad financially loss experience. Too bad I should have used another air service.

### "pleasant staff"
Not Verified |  Travelled Manchester to Bangkok return via Muscat with Oman Air. All 4 flights on time. Great food, pleasant staff, and great inflight entertainment. Would certainly use them again.

### "Seats were comfortable"
Bangkok to Muscat. Generally, in business classes with a 2-2-2 configuration, the passengers seating on a window seat have to pass over their neighbors when going to the toilet or else, but on Oman Air, all passengers, despite that 2-2-2 configuration, have a direct access to the corridors. Seats were comfortable, amenities very good, food average, wine excellent, though very small selection, and crew extremely friendly. Flight was on time, boarding was done in an orderly way. Only problem was that the entertainment system was not working properly on my seat (but was perfectly ok on the return).

### "extremely bad experience"
Not Verified |  I had an extremely bad experience with Oman air. I had booked a ticket from Mumbai to Kuwait via Muscat. For some reason I checked the Manage booking option around a month and a half before the travel and found the flight schedule has changed. There was a 20 Hour stop over at Muscat (Instead of 1h 20m as per the earlier plan). The flight schedule was changed by around 5 hours. Firstly it was wrong on the part of Airline not to even inform that the schedule has changed. On approaching the customer care the options were not suitable as the change itself was of around 5 hours and would not let me reach my destination on time. On further requesting they told me to cancel the ticket and pay all the penalty. I really do not understand that for the fault of the airline why the customer should pay the penalty. Any changes suggested by them would make me lose a day at source of the destination. I think this is totally unacceptable.

### "the worst customer service"
Jakarta to Munich via Muscat . They have the worst customer service and I would never book a ticket again. We had to change a flight and then the problems started. They told us how much it would cost, but we couldn't pay online. They gave us their bank account number and we had to go to the bank to pay for it. After three days that we paid for the change we got an email that the price for the ticket change and that we have to pay double. We called to local customer services that we dont want to pay that anount and that we dont understand how can that happen. They said that they can refund the additional money that we paid. But then got complicated because they had to do international transfer and they had to charge US a tranfer fee. In addition them we wanted to cancel first flight and when we called local and then Oman customer services noone knew how much money we get back if we even get any. We wrote them an email and got no answer. We talked with them on FB and Whatsup and noone had any answers. Their customer support is just there that you can call them but they do not know anything. They can check your flight and that is it. I think they know the same as you when you enter your booking number on the internet. So think twice before you book a flight with them.

### "should undergo training"
Manila to London via Muscat. This is in reference to my recent trip via Oman Air WY0101 from Muscat to Heathrow. The flight attendants, not all of them but most I should say, should undergo training in customer service / handling! I noticed that they are short fused with the passengers’ requests, questions etc. I went to the toilet and an Indian lady before me had difficulty closing the door so I helped her. Quite an effort to close the toilet door as apparently for whatever reason it was stuck. When it was my turn, I decided not to close the door anymore as I was just going to brush my teeth and I just hate the toilets of airplanes! So as I was brushing my teeth this male attendant yells at me to close my door. Since I was finishing off already, I just signaled my left hand to him and I just kept my door open since I was almost done. Next thing he kicks my door to close it. Told him he is so rude and why did he have to kick the toilet door. He reasons  that he didn’t kick my door and he just pushed it! I don’t know if this was brought to the attention of any of the superiors around. I’ve been traveling with different airlines and this is the very first time I have encountered such an unfathomable incident.

### "sparkling service on board"
Not Verified |  London to Muscat. Everything about this flight experience was just so right. A very pleasant business class lounge at Heathrow to delicious food and sparkling service on board the plane. Oman are really up there with the best.

### "I believe I was deceived"
Doha to Kuala Lumpur via Muscat. I have wanted to try Oman Air and wanted to experience the new business class suites. But was very disappointed with my recent travel in Business Class. Old A330 Business class seats, I said ok its only 1hr flight lets deal with this and Im sure the next leg is the new suites like I expected with Oman Air. Staff were rude on board, no pre boarding drinks offered. I was quite hungry I though you will serve a Hot snack, but nothing 40mins into flight the Air hostess brang me a bag of dates and yogurt. Arrived to Muscat and Lounge was excellent, food options were outstanding and very clean and luxury feeling. I again asked regarding if the next plane will have the new seating and was confirmed twice once in lounge and second at gate. Got on board and old lay out. This time cabin crew were outstanding and food was great, but there was one drunk passenger in economy who was swearing and shouting and was restrained by cabin crew. The thing that I was shocked was no one from the flight deck assisted or made an announcement as a courtesy to make everyone feel safe. Took Flight WY822 on 23rd, Old seating again,  I believe I was deceived by Oman Air to purchase these tickets with all advertisements regarding the new business class seats.

### "Worst ever experience"
Worst ever experience with Oman airlines. I travelled with Infant from Muscat to Munich, flight was delayed by 6 hrs to Munich. Because of this connection is flight is missed. When we asked about this with Oman duty manager at Munich, she was so arrogant and didn't rebook the ticket for connection flight. I have spent so much amount of money and booked a ticket on myself. Worst Experience.

### Oman Air customer review
Tehran to Frankfurt via  Muscat. They are super slow, worst service, disgusting food. My TV wouldnt come up from the side of my seat because I was in front and it was the baby bassinet seats so the tv has to get pulled from under my seat. I asked for an extra pillow and they didn't give me one. We missed our next flight to Toronto and they couldn't care less. It took 3 hours for an Oman air rep to come and talk to us and another few hours for them to give us new flights. They take blankets 1 hour before flight arrival not caring that people are cold. Cherry on top: they lost my luggage.

### "window blinds were closed"
Muscat to Dubai on a B787-8. This short hop is now served with big planes and a reduced frequency since the grounding of the 737-Max. Flight on time, check-in fast, immigration reasonably quick on both sides. I don’t think it would need a rubber sandwich served in a hectic rush on this short flight. What really disturbed me was that the window blinds (which are automatic on the 787) were closed and could not be opened manually all the time. There was no need for this at 9 in the morning. I selected a window seat (and paid for it) on purpose.

### "toilets were dirty"
Muscat to Frankfurt. Worst airline I have ever travelled with. Flight was delayed, staff is incapable and unfriendly, airplane was old and dirty, toilets were dirty, bad and greasy food, seat was broken.

### "customer support is poor"
Riyadh to Bombay via Muscat. Flight delay and customer support is poor, not getting solutions and next flight more than 6 hrs waiting. Offered only food which I denied.

### "delayed by more than six hours"
Manchester to Manila via Muscat. The flight from Manchester was delayed by one hour, when we reach Muscat airport we've seen in the gate that our connecting flights from to Manila supposed to be 8.45am was change to 2.45pm which is  delayed by more than six hours. No explanation has been given. Breakfast and lunch are free on KFC which is the cheapest food order and you cannot choose your meal.

### "They are a really good airline"
Not Verified |  Manchester to Muscat. I enjoyed my flight with Oman Air. They are a really good airline. The movie choice is excellent and so is the food. I had a lamb kofta. I found that the landing was hard but nobody is to put to blame seen as the day I landed it was very windy. Oman Air’s safety video is unique because it shows you places around Oman.

### "lack of communication"
Bangkok to London via Muscat. First leg of flight delayed for 4 hours, with no explanation. Missed our connecting flight to London. The lack of communication from Oman air staff is a absolute joke. Made a complaint over a month ago, and have now spoken to around 40 call centre staff, who keep telling me they can’t transfer calls, and it’s not their department. Which it is. Rude and very unhelpful. Will never use them again. Absolutely no manners or feedback whatsoever. They must have bought that award.

### "an awful experience"
Kuala Lumpur to Abu Dhabi via Muscat. I had an emergency and needed to fly from Malaysia to UAE. I booked my tickets through a third party company last minute and they were not confirmed on time which is not Oman Air's fault. The check in counter staff was really helpful and tried their best to help me. When I was taken to the service counter, the person working was incredibly unhelpful. I wanted to purchase tickets and he could have done so many things to help, like help me book them online or call the company for me. Instead, I stood at the counter and he refused to do anything about it. I will not fly with Oman air because I had such an awful experience.

### "Excellent Business class product"
Milan to Colombo via Muscat. Excellent Business class product. Great Service, food and seats like a small suite. I use to fly on Business class in many other airlines and I would say that Oman Air Business Class is in my top 5 Airlines.

### "worst experience ever"
Islamabad to London via Muscat. It was worst experience ever with this airline. At first, the staff kept us seated for almost 3 hours in a plane which had defective air-conditioning. My two year kid, who has no history of claustrophobia, started panicking to the extreme and the staff still kept telling us to keep him belted to the seat. After that, told us to disembark, made us wait in the waiting lounge for next 3 hours again and then finally informed us on the cancellation of the flight. The staff recollected all boarding passes, essentially leaving us without any proof that we were ever here for the flight. They slowly pulled out their name from all this and cleverly, I must add and left us at the mercy of Pakistan's civil aviation authority. This all happened while we were being told that it is part of hotel reservation. Until, there was no hotel reservation, we were taken out of the airport into the arrival section. While we were asking for help from aviation authority, the staff of airline left on hotel fleets right before our eyes. At the moment, I am here waiting for next flight, which I hope they fulfill, in a cheap hotel. There is no confirmation on our new connecting flights. Hoping for the best here and preparing for the worst as well.

### "lack of communication"
Dubai to Bangkok via Muscat. I experienced such a terrible trip with Oman Air. My flight from Muscat to Bangkok was supposed to take off at 10:00 pm to reach Bangkok at 7:00 just the right time to catch my connected flight from Bangkok to Phuket that was supposed to leave at 10;30 to reach Phuket at 12:30, but due to technical problem in Omar Air we had to stay until 2 am and when telling that we have a connected they told us don’t worry pay for it and call our customer care explain to them what happened and they will reimburse the full amount when contacting customer care and emailing them. They responded we had to talk to the customer relation in the airport , while customer relation were the people advising us to contact customer care and to visit our website. That shows the lack of communication the airline has.

### "WiFi is overpriced"
Manila to Munich via Muscat. I was very surprised, that staff give food only twice during a 9 hour flight. They serve us breakfast after take off and than before landing was lunch. After dinner everybody get water and that was all. When I go to staff and ask something to drink they offer me water and sparkling water. Nothing more. Between food was 6 hours and if I didn’t go for water, I was been without drink also 6 hours. Never more! WiFi is overpriced.

### "toilets are disgusting"
Heathrow to Bangkok via Muscat. Been flying with Oman Air since 2010. I must say each time it has got worse. Service is pretty good. However the toilets are disgusting and have wet floors with soaked tissues. 8 hours from Heathrow to Muscat and no one cleaned up the mess. I have experienced this on many occasions. This used to be my favourite airline.

### "provided courteous service"
Kathmandu to Male via Muscat. It’s my third time traveling with Oman Air and it is one of the best airlines I have travelled. I appreciate all the cabin attendants who have provided us with courteous service today. They were calm and attended every passengers request with smile.

### "connection to Dubai already left"
Jakarta to Dubai via Muscat. The plane was delayed approx. 1h from Jakarta to Oman. When we arrived in Muscat, still 1h hour before the next leg, we have been told by the ground staff that our connection to Dubai already left. Beside the fact that the boarding was still ongoing, they told us that they put us on the next flight which was approx. 6h later. Things got sour when I had the insolence to ask for a lounge access in order to make my wait more comfortable. I have been told my a rude ground staff, barely looking at my ticket, that I should be happy they put me on the next flight because I already paid for the cheapest ticket. Unbelievable! I missed my connection because of them, I paid for a regular economy ticket. I don't consider too much to ask to have (at least) simple polite refusal. No need to make your customers feel like thief and paid for your poor management. This staff and this airlines is a disgrace of all Middle Eastern airlines I flew with.

### "the service was excellent"
Paris to Bangkok via Muscat. My wife and I were traveling to Thailand on holiday. We like having a stop on the way as find long flights tiring and boring. Check in at Paris was speedy and directed to the Cathay lounge which was perfectly acceptable. I find it very surprising that when an airline has 2 air bridges available to them they only use one. Add to this that they do not manage Business Boarding very well I find incredible! This was one area, the only area really that Oman Air let them selves down! All our flights were on time and the service was excellent and food was varied and tasty served with some very nice wines. The aircraft were nearly new and everything worked. What more can I say, would we fly with them again, yes, without doubt!

### "experience has been average"
Jakarta to Cairo via Muscat. Oman air operates from terminal 3 in Jakarta which is the new and better terminal in Jakarta, check-in was fast and efficient, departure gate was lovely. We boarded on time by friendly staff, the flight took off 2 hours late due to heavy congestion in Jakarta, soon after take-off food menus were distributed which is a lovely touch, three main meal choices. I chose the Vegetarian Biryani, which was pretty good, IFE system on this flight was good, new and had plenty of options, there was another meal service before landing in Muscat, and the food was tasty. The crew on this flight was friendly. We landed at Muscat airport a little late. The transit was pretty smooth and the terminal was new - however, if you do not check the notice board, you would miss your flight, because there isn't any boarding call. We boarded our 737 with no smiles but frowns, got to my seat which had new IFE. No menus and super slow staff, there was only one option which was beef and veggies, almost inedible, the IFE system was poor, when you plug the earpiece in it would sound glitchy because the cord was being pushed on. Landed in Cairo on time. The experience has been average.

### "like flying on Ryanair"
Colombo to Paris via Muscat. A nightmare. Announcements, commercials, screen ads, every 15 minutes, impossible to watch a movie without being disturbed. The food is really bad compared to other mid-east airlines, it felt like flying on Ryanair.

### "I found it very average"
Bangkok to Muscat and I found it very average. With the exception of a very friendly and professional Filipina flight attendant, the crew looked as if they did not want to be there. Food presentation was poor, in cheap looking flimsy containers and taste was just ok. The entertainment not bad , but fairly poor in the music selection.

### "Return was not as good"
A tale of 2 halves. LHR to Muscat 4 days ago was amazing. Return was not as good. Lounge is really nice. Good selection of food. Nespresso machine was a life saver. Good selection of drinks - lounge ran out of champagne - that’s a first. Boarding was fine. Hard product is fine. At this level it is all down to the crew. Just felt this flight had the B team. No greeting from cabin director or introduction or check during flight. I still remember the names of the crew from previous flight. Dirty wine glasses - rather than swapping some silly excuse about water stains. Drinks not brought out with meals. Call button not responded for 15 mins. Need to be consistent if going to compete again the other Middle East airlines.

### "seats are fantastic"
London to Muscat. Checkin was quick. Oman Air uses Gulf Air lounge - nice spacious lounge. Good selection of food and drinks. Nice view of the apron from the lounge. It was 35 mins before departure and was told to grab another drink as boarding had not commenced. Announcement made in the lounge to go to gate. Business class boarding was quick. First time in Oman Air - Apex seats are fantastic. Had a window seat - staggered formation allows for easy aisle access and very private. Offered a glass of champagne with nuts before take off. Cabin director introduced herself and suggested a medium size pyjamas - I was flattered but went for a large size. Staff did a fantastic job looking after us. Very attentive and friendly. The dinner menu was extensive and delicious. Great drinks selection. Had an espresso before landing - cabin staff brought some pastries but was still full from dinner.

### "check in take too long"
Kuala Lumpur to Muscat. Business Class check in counter take too long to issue tickets. No appropriate counter for business class client. Announcement on boarding was not clear. Cabin Staff in flight was not friendly. My business class seat also not tidy and food average. In flight entertainment average.

### "What a disgrace"
London to Cochin via Muscat. Muscat to London. Seems to be a problem in Muscat with baggage. 3 days now, going home. Never again. Rotten to the core. Here in India not worth trying. What a disgrace.

### "worst customer service"
London to Mashad via Muscat. The worst customer service experience ever. My luggage arrived 3 days after my arrival at the distension airport. I had to pay for the cab as a tourist to go back to the airport where I found my suitcases badly damaged. None of the Oman air staff in Mashhad airport attended to my complaint or inquires. I called many times to Oman air customer service but could not get any help. Then I submitted my delayed and damaged luggage online form with all the documents attached but have not received even 1 single response till now that I am back in Canada. No email reply, no follow up, no compensation for damaged or delayed luggages whatsoever. I will not fly again with Oman air and do not recommend it.

### "inflight meal could be improved"
Kuala Lumpur to Muscat via Bahrain. Business class is comfortable, Service is good. I was taking Malaysia Airline followed by Oman air, called their call centre, assisted me to check the baggage allowance and took the initiative to call back to confirm. The inflight meal could be improved, somewhat doesn't impressed me. this is the only point to improve. i know this is an middle east airline, but since you are flying from Asia country, probably could include some Asia cuisine.

### "Horrible service experience"
Muscat to Dubai. Horrible service experience, I booked my exit seat prior to the flight, while boarding, I was surprised that they changed my seat, cause someone paid for it! And the manager said “sorry he paid more” I was astonished! Don’t recommend this flight.

### "showed seat unassigned"
Kuala Lumpur to Amman via Muscat. We purchased our tickets on 31Aug2018 and prepaid seats selection to travel on 22Dec2018. Our e-ticket showed confirmed seat numbers so imagine our shock when we checked-in online and the screen showed seat unassigned! I called the call centre in Kuala Lumpur and the guy told us to just check in and the seat will be assign then. We were assigned different seats! Called the call centre again and was told to check at airport check in, which we did and was told there was nothing they can do since we have checked in. On our return leg, again, when we tried to online check in, seats came out unassigned even though tickets showed confirmed seats. This time we checked in at the airport and guess what? Our "confirmed seats" have been booked by someone else! We made a ruckus at the airport and the supervisor then told us that he would give us emergency exit seats. I specifically asked for window and aisle. He said however boarding pass can only be issued at Muscat for these tickets. So when we arrived Muscat, again there was no such instruction and they can offer 2 middle seats at emergency exit seats which we declined. We ended up with 2 aisle seats at row 49. Our prepaid seats were window/ aisle row 26. I have since lodged a complaint and asked for refund but no reply yet. The flight experience itself was fairly unpleasant. The boarding was chaotic as they do not board by rows rather just allow everyone to board all at once. Food was pretty bad. The flight attendants were fairly surly and toilets were not cleaned regularly. The only positive experience was the in flight entertainment. Layover at Muscat is pretty expensive but thank goodness we had complimentary lounge passes from our credit card. Honestly, it was cheaper than the other flights by about USD200 but it's a very unpleasant experience.

### "thoroughly enjoyed my journey"
I had a fantastic experience with Oman Air flying from Manchester to Islamabad return in Business class. I used the Oman Air Upgrade (Option Town) which is fantastic value for money. The staff in business class were really attentive, friendly and professional. I especially enjoyed the Omani coffee and dates they serve when you board the flight (Manchester-Muscat route). The beds were extremely comfortable and they provided a lovely wash-bag as well as useful storage compartments next to your bed to store your phone and other small items you are carrying. The food was outstanding; I especially enjoyed the Arabic Mezze platter they served and the attention to detail they made with the meal. Their Karak Chai (which I had after my meal) was superb. The inflight entertainment was really good, I especially appreciated how even on a short 2/3 hour flight from Muscat to Islamabad you can still access all of the entertainment they provide (they also give you a main meal which is really generous). I would definitely recommend family and friends to fly with Oman Air business class. I thoroughly enjoyed my journey and would happily fly with them again.

### "are not eligible for a room"
Colombo to London via Muscat. Muscat layover was 2.5 hours as per the ticket confirmation. 2 days later Oman Air changed the schedule and emailed us a new itinerary which made the layover in Muscat 7.55 hours. When we arrived at Muscat we spoke with Oman Air customer service to see if they can give us a comfortable place to stay or any other compensation for the change they made to our schedule. We explained we have 2 kids and it’s not comfortable to stay at the airport for 8 hours. The person who was at the counter was rude and not even considering to look for an option to make us comfortable. He said if the layover was 8 hours he can give us a room. But since it is 7.55 hours we are not eligible for a room. Oman air must make passenger’s comfort the first priority.

### "the service was excellent"
Jakarta to Muscat. First time I have flown with Oman air, the service was excellent, the food fabulous, the comfort of the cabin amazing. The bed has a comforter and a nice blanket. The entertainment program has amazing latest Hollywood movies. The cabin crew with the cabin director by the name Ismail was super friendly and super helpful. They make us feel at home . The aircraft is brand new and clean. Thank you Oman Air, we will fly again soon.

### "Fantastic flight"
Manila to London via  Muscat. Fantastic flight, the flight attendants were very helpful, and friendly. Definitely I will fly Oman Air again.

### "supported by the ground staff"
Riyadh to Bengaluru return via Muscat. I traveled from Riyadh to Bengaluru in economy class and I am a vegetarian. I was told that the vegetarian food is exhausted in economy class, I just asked for some water. But the gentleman on board went to Business class section and brought me vegetarian food. It is a very simple gesture which was done by the crew but it went a long way for me since I have seen other airlines which just does not offer services like this. When I was travelling back to Riyadh, I had booked extra baggage, and unfortunately I had made a mistake in packing my bags (obviously I did not read the packing instructions). I was very well supported by the ground staff in Bengaluru who helped me in checking in my bags on time and they did their job so well, it reflected that the customer is very important to them. The only drawback which I see in Oman Air is the cramp for leg room and when informed the same to the staff and requested for the seats near fire escape, they obliged. Hopefully I will fly Oman Air without the cramping leg space.

### "staff have no manners"
London to Najaf via Muscat. On board flight staff and services were awesome but Oman Air staff at Oman Airport was pain. They even have no manners and don't know how to talk with passengers. They should realized that they are getting paid because of our business.

### "Seats very cramped"
London to Kochi via Muscat. Largely agree with some of the recent comments about Oman Air. Though it's about a year since I last travelled with Qatar or Emirates, Oman is a fair way behind them in terms of passenger comfort or service. Seats very cramped, but I'll come to that later. Food OK, but very stingy with the drinks (only one round on a 7hr flight), and it took virtually an hour for the grumpy crew to clear up the empties for the meal service. Not acceptable. Flight out was delayed, and even though there was an hour to spare at Muscat, bizarrely, they denied us boarding on the connecting flight to India, preferring to bump us onto the presumably less popular flight at 2 am the following day. OK, they put us up in a hotel for a few hours, but we missed the first day of our India tour as a result, with all the phone calls that required. Finally, when I booked this flight it was due to be operated by an A330 with 34" legroom, but then Oman Air changed it to a Boeing 787 with 31". Also one more seat squeezed in per row. Result was very cramped conditions and narrow uncomfortable seat. Not why I booked the flight with them. A definite downgrade. I know the Boeing 787 divides opinion . But I'm sure it's a lot more economical for the airlines to run, but I've yet to have a pleasant flight in one. Streets behind the A330/340 or 777, and a very poky little aeroplane compared to the A380 or 747. First and last outing with them, I'm afraid.

### "found it to be average"
Zurich to Bangkok via Muscat. First time flying Oman Air, found it to be average. Food was very average, the crew is very slow with service and waits way too long to clean up. Therefore on a 6h-ish flight, you have almost no chance to relax or sleep. Inflight entertainment is not very good.

### "Unbeatable value for money"
Not Verified |  Nairobi to Manila via Muscat. Night flight Nairobi to Muscat average, but flight from Muscat to Manila excellent. The new airport and lounge in Muscat are great. Security check in the transfer zone was arrogant. The flight from Muscat to Manila was one of my best flight experience. Excellent and friendly staff. They showed great customer service. Dinner was the best I ever had on any flights. Unbeatable value for money.

### "lost my luggage"
London to Kochi via Muscat. The experience inside the flight was average but I have to say that there customer service is the worst. Because of their carelessness I lost my luggage. When I claimed for it they didn’t pay that much interest in it and also didn’t pay me back enough. I never experienced such a bad service from anywhere.

### "not a cool experience"
Delhi to Cairo via Muscat. Firstly the touch screen for in-flight entertainment did not work in two sectors. For one sector - Cairo to Muscat, they didn't even have a in-flight entertainment. The cabin temperature from Muscat to Delhi was uncomfortable. Only one good experience was Muscat Airport. Throughout the journey, there was nothing I could recommend. From Muscat to Delhi - the crew did not have headphones as well. So all in all, not a cool experience.

### "the seats are quite narrow"
Travelled from Heathrow to Bangkok via Muscat, return. All flights were on Boeing 787-9. Cabins are spacious and clean, and the seating in economy is ok, but the seats are quite narrow, especially if you are sat next to a larger person. Whilst the food was quite good, and the choice of beverages ok, the cabin staff were on the whole were not of a good standard. We had one particular cabin crew member that was extremely rude, and unfortunately was on our return leg also. Overall we found the entire crew to be quite unfriendly and abrupt, although there were exceptions. In-flight entertainment was good - big screen, good quality video and audio. Film selection is slightly limited, but only really an issue if you have 4 flights in a row! No issues with ground staff - everything ran smoothly and on time.

### "a very positive experience"
Milan to Manila via Muscat. It was a very positive experience. Short layovers and the flight themselves passed quickly, also thanks to the entertainment offered on board. Cabin staff really kind and also keen to exchanging a couple of words. Only negative part was maybe the distance between a row and the other - not necessarily the comfort of chairs, as I guess and seat would become not too comfortable after 4+ hr flights! Would definitely fly again and recommend!

### "no complaints about inflight services"
Kuwait to Mumbai via Muscat. Traveling with family for 3 days only. Flight from Kuwait delayed by 2 hours but was not informed by staff at check-in. They informed us only at the lounge 1 hour prior to flight to be at the Gate 30 minutes past the scheduled departure time. Missed my connecting flight to Mumbai which had 1:20 minutes transit & was booked on the next flight after 8 hrs. One Airport official guiding passengers after Security check was very arrogant & did not know how to handle customers; leave basic service skills aside and most importantly not in authority. I really dont know how the Airport hired him and also complained to Airport officials. Inflight services were great with decent IFE (Boeing 737-900). Food was the best I had on any flights (5 Star); delicious & sumptuous. I was to be put up at the First/Business Class lounge until my connection but on request the Airport staff were kind enough to arrange our visas & hotel with to & fro Airport transfers. Connecting flight was an old & tired Boeing 737-800 which was again delayed by 40 mins. Extremely frustrating trip that costed us missing our Doctor's appointment whose availability is only once per week. Return flights on Economy were on time but one of our bag was damaged. Overall, no complaints whatsoever about the inflight services but everything else is a mediocre & that lousy Airport official who taints the Airport & Airlines reputation. With so much of experiences endured, I don’t think I will fly with them again.

### "best flight experiences"
Munich to Manila via Muscat. Staff were excellent, friendly, fast. Flexible food service. Attentive to needs of customer. Flight left on time and arrived in Manila Early. Luggage was delivered early. One of the best flight experiences I ever had after flying worldwide millions of miles.

### "very modern and comfortable"
Dammam to Frankfurt via Muscat. The flights were all on time. The seats had great interactive entertainment systems. Muscat airport is a huge plus for the airline as well as transit customers. The meals were sufficient and tasty. The complementary amenity kit was an excellent addition to their service, and a valued souvenir. The only major downside is that the seat on the A330 felt small, and there were no air vents making the cabin very hot. However, the seats and cabin onboard the B737 were very modern and comfortable. The cabin crew did a great job; however, it would be nice if they didn't look sad/angry to do their job.

### "cabin crew rather uninterested"
Manchester to Muscat. First time flying with Oman Air, given it was the cheapest of all airlines and I only had less than two weeks notice of travelling. Would recommend if you are travelling last minute and need an affordable flight, and do not care about the sub-par service they provide. First impression with the airline was presented at the check-in counter at Manchester Airport. The person behind the counter was cold, dismissive and clearly thought that talking and laughing around with her colleague was more important than the customers directly on the other side of the counter. Minimal eye contact towards us were made but maximally with her colleagues. Boarding and take-off on the Boeing 787-9 was smooth. I have to agree with others on the cabin crew - many of them were rather uninterested in their passengers (at least in economy). The cabin crew in this Oman Air flight reminded me of the cabin crew in some budget airlines so do not expect much. Food was surprisingly tasty and inflight entertainment was ample for a decent long haul flight. An amenities kit which consisted of a sleeping mask, a pair of socks, toothbrush and toothpaste were provided which I think was a nice touch.

### "a solid airline"
Zürich to Kuala Lumpur via Muscat. Solid airline. We chose to fly with this airline for a second time, because we had a good experience two years. This time, the cabin crew seemed a little distant to the customers. Not as friendly as we remembered. The food was so-so (we had special meals (no lactose and vegetarian)). There was no problem with our special wishes, which is good. On-Board entertainment was very good, with a good collection of different movies to watch. Our emails to the customer services were not answered. This could or needs to be improved. All in all a solid airline with room for improvement.

### "Lahore check-in was so slow
Lahore to London via Muscat. At Lahore Airport the check-in was so slow that it took 1.25 hours to check-in 7 people in front of me. Apparently, the system was down and the contractor company was so rubbish that they were not even bothered to get a hard copy of the flight manifest. They tried to charge money for something which I was not able to understand and when I refused to pay without getting a receipt, said that I have to get my boarding passes for the next flight in Muscat. I asked to explain the reason why I have to do that, No reason was given. When asked for the manager boarding passes appeared in no time. The first leg of the flight was ok. The crew was efficient but it was limited to the standards airline was trying to attain. Stopover at Muscat Airport was a nightmare. It has a new terminal which is good to be a bus terminal. They have a lot of staff to direct but there is not enough food options or duty-free shops. You have to go through the security check once you come out of aircraft and again to next aircraft. We have to discard the water bottles which we bought from the duty-free. All the toilets are before the security check on the boarding gates. The second leg of travel was on Boeing 787 which was a good experience - new aircraft. Again the food was just ok. not enough entertainment options. Headsets were absolutely rubbish, we have to use our phone hand frees.

### "avoided eye contact"
Not Verified | London to Kuala Lumpur via Muscat. Both flights delayed as we had to wait 45 mins for connecting passengers each time. Cabin Crew looked busy and did not greet passengers and avoided eye contact. Food very small and average. Films were old.

### "did not bother to check"
No vegetarian meal served as I requested when booking. Stated that my name was not on the list (wrong information because other connecting flights had my name on the list). Flight attendants did not bother to check and were rude. Cold dinner was served on 12/06/18 from Oman to London. Not satisfied with the experience. Very disappointed.

### "a very good experience"
Kuala Lumpur to London via Muscat. This was a very good experience. We were able to use the excellent Malaysia Airlines lounge at KL. Boarding was efficient and the welcome on board was warm. Our window seats were very comfortable, fully lie-flat but perhaps a little narrow. The meal choices were extensive and the quality was good. Muscat airport was uncrowded and easy to move through, and the lounge was spacious and pleasant. While the first flight operated on time, the second flight had a 90-minute delay, for reasons explained by the captain once we boarded. The aircraft had what looked like an older cabin -- more roomy and with much more storage, but with a more dated feel. The service was a little more hit and miss. Overall the flights were extremely good value for the fare paid.

### "improve the ground staff service"
London to Lahore via Muscat. From London the flight was comfortable. We were served good quality food. Entertainment system was average, there were not many options for movies etc but they had some new choices. Flight crew on both legs of the journey were very helpful and caring as I was travelling with my 3-year-old son. Both aircraft were pretty new and maintained well but there is need to improve the quality of food to 4 or 5 star standards. I will travel on Oman Air again, but only if they improve the ground staff service quality and airport security, otherwise you may travel with any other airline from Middle East then Oman Air.

### "food was copious and excellent"
Milan Malpensa to Nairobi via Muscat. The online check in and bag drop were smooth. Both flights operated on time. The private lounge at Malpensa was very comfortable and not crowded, but with limited food and drink options. On both flights the service was friendly and efficient. Aboard the A330 the food was copious and excellent, and the seats were comfortable and gave a good night's rest. At Muscat the new lounge was extremely comfortable, not at all crowded and with a variety of very tasty food - the best Business Class lounge I have experienced (alcoholic drinks were not available as it was Ramadan). Our onward B737 flight to Nairobi was more basic - old-style Business Class seats with IFE screens stowed in the armrest. The food was fine - no alcohol was offered on this flight (perhaps because of Ramadan), but some passengers apparently knew it could be obtained by asking. Business passengers were bussed to the terminal first, and their luggage came out first - very impressive.

### "service was excellent"
Chennai to Muscat. I travelled Oman Air after a gap of a few years. I chose Oman Air as I had to make an onward connection to Doha. I was amazed by my experience. Ground handling was super smooth. Aircraft was supremely neat and clean. Crew were hospitable and very helpful. In flight service was excellent. Transit was well managed though the lounge was a bit crowded. Onward flight to Doha was good as well.

### "One of the best"
Dubai to Bangkok via Muscat. One of the best in class service. Flight was operated by Boeing 787 business class. Its the best business class cabin compared to A330-300 which I flew before. Meals and IFE was awesome and they have wide choice of regional language entertainment. They had a wide choice of decent menu and cabin crew were extra polite and excellent service. The ground staff also were very helpful. 100% recommended airline with no delay in both onward and return journey. The return flight from MCT to DXB was operated in Boeing 737 Max which is a super silent aircraft. Many thanks for the excellent service by Oman air and will see you in future travel.

### "Staff very friendly"
Muscat to Munich return in business in April. Out on an old A330, return on a new B787. I prefer the old Oman Air business class seats and cabin configuration, which is much more spacious than the new - somewhat crammed - 2-2-2. Seats comfortable on both planes. If stretched out into the bed position even the 2-2-2 of the 787 gives enough privacy. IFE of excellent technical quality with a somewhat dated movie selection. Impressive printed menu, and food and drinks were excellent. But on both flights I did not get my choice from the menu. On the way out they had even run out of all but one option of starters and main when it was my turn to order. I was not sitting in the last business cabin row. Staff very friendly, very helpful but - again as usual at Oman Air - sometimes disturbingly loud in the galley during their off times.

### "never fly with this airline again"
Salalah to London  via Muscat. I was very disappointed by the lack of customer service, on the ground by check in staff as well as the cabin crew. Unfortunately we experienced a 12 hour delay due to a late arriving flight causing us to miss our connection. These things do happen - but this was not the worst of the problem. We received no apology from the airline and after wandering around trying to find someone to help us, we were treated as though this was our problem. After speaking to the customer service desk in Muscat and waiting a further 15 minutes for an Oman Air service supervisor she explained that we would go to a hotel and wait until the next flight. This supervisor was extremely rude. We were not allowed to take our luggage to the hotel - so there really wasn't much point in a hotel as we couldn't freshen up or use the facilities. The hotel was disgusting anyway so wouldn't have used it regardless. With myself and my partner paying £800 between us, I am shocked this is the best they can offer. We were not allowed any drinks other than juice, unless you wanted to pay extra as the airline would not cover this. The best thing about the airline was the in flight entertainment - but don't expect to be able to watch it as there are constant  announcements,  in three different languages. We flew overnight and hoped we would be able to sleep throughout. This was not possible with the constant announcements and being woken up for breakfast at 1am when the flight did not arrive until 4.30. I  would never fly with this airline again.

### "the crew being the carriers weak link"
Flights mainly on time and the Y class section on the A330 aircraft is above average in quality with a 34 inch seat pitch. 737 Y class poor with very firm seat. The airline is mainly let down by a large number of the crew being disinterested e.g. on the outbound 7 hour leg only doing the rounds for beverages on two occasions this is not normal for a flight of this length. Some crew do go above and beyond but the airline clearly has issues overall with the crew performance that needs to be addressed. Overall though due to the above average seating on the A330 I would say the experience was quite positive despite the crew being the carriers weak link.

### "plus is the great legroom"
Muscat to London. The main plus is the great legroom - they are like premium economy seats, with corresponding extra recline. Highly recommended. Aircrew are very nice and efficient and the meals were unremarkable.

### "the crew were great"
Flew Oman Air from Dubai to Muscat. Lovely airline, lovely crew. Despite a near 2 hour delay on departure from DXB, due to a sandstorm, the crew were great, water and snacks delivered throughout the delay and the Flight Deck gave us up-to-date information as and when they received it. Only downside? Bring back the snack-box with the mini pretzels, dip, mini cheese snack and date bar with water all in one box. The new sandwich and water is awful; the sandwich is just a blob of dough with which can only be described as some sort of reformed chicken type paste. Awful! Even the crew miss the snack-box. But overall, good airline and good crew.

### "wait 8 hours at the airport"
Muscat to Karachi. Oman Air overbooked, had to wait 8 hours at the airport. My mother had wheelChair support but no one try helping us out. They didn't even load my suitcases. No dinner, No place to stay. During flight No head phones was given for flight. Asked for water they took 35min to bring it.

### "consistently better pricing"
Muscat to Doha. I like them a lot. Cabin crew are less plastic and more human than some in the area. The planes are hit and miss - some great ones (beds etc) and some old ones that have seen better days. My bags and I have departed ways more than once in muscat - but within 24 hours we are reunited. The shared lounge in London bucharest and vienna are all ok too. Oman air is an honest, down to earth option and the new airport beautiful (even if transit security is a mess, wifi needs an sms and the staff seem lost inside the new space) I'm giving them a try - as my prefered carrier in this region. A genuinely friendly option with consistently better pricing than many.

### "it was a pleasant journey"
Kuala Lumpur to Dubai via Muscat. First time to fly with Oman Air. Did online check in and chose a seat. However, upon boarding, the seat that i selected was blocked. I was asked to wait for almost everyone to have their seat to check on a vacant seat. Cabin crew, although nice and pleasant, were not smiling for when I interacted with them. Surprisingly, Arabic food served was tasty. InFlight entertainment was good. Seat was comfortable. Overall, it was a pleasant journey.

### Oman Air customer review
London to Abu Dhabi via Muscat. Check in felt chaotic and disorganised. Boarding was late. Onboard a small snack was served after 45 minutes. Dinner was served 2 hours in to the flight which was past midnight UK time. I was asleep head down on the tray table, the cabin crew made several attempts to wake me for my meal which I did not appreciate. In Economy 5 toilets exist, only 2 were operational. Breakfast roll on landing was substandard. Generally cabin crew are pleasant, leg room was ample, in flight entertainment seemed okay but I did not use it. In summary Oman Air are the cheapest on some routes, I probably would fly with them again if they offered a considerable saving. However you won't get the bells and whistles. If you are looking for a cheap flight and don't care much for the food or service, this airline works just fine.

### "No menu was given to us"
Dubai to Manchester via Muscat. The staff were not welcoming. No menu was given to us on our outbound flight and the option we chose had run out on our outbound flight. The toilet was horrendous in economy, and one of the toilet on our inbound flight had no water. Ground crew in Manchester and Dubai the greatest asset.

### "not so good food"
Muscat to Milan. This was my fourth time flying Omanair. After that I can say I have found a big difference from the first time flow. Really surprised how changed in less service, space seat and service. From Muscat to Milan the hostess unkind and nervous, poor service and not so good food.

### "a battle to get any type of service"
Oman Air’s website boldly states that “Flying Oman Air is only the beginning of a beautiful relationship with us. We believe customer satisfaction is of paramount importance”. A more accurate statement would be “Flying Oman Air is the beginning and the end of the shortest relationship you will ever have since customer satisfaction is not of any importance to us”. During a return journey from London to Bangalore via Muscat, four flights my wife, 1-year old son and I, encountered the following: 1) London Heathrow to Muscat: We were allocated a bassinet seat. The stewardess informed us that she would bring a bassinet for our baby shortly. She subsequently provided one to the couple beside us (who were also allocated a bassinet seat) and then informed us that they had run out of bassinets for the long-haul flight despite us sitting in a bassinet seat! 2) LHR to MCT: I was told at check-in that I would get our pushchair at the door when I get off the plane in BLR. We did not and had to carry our son until we received our luggage on the belt. This happened again on the return flight. 3) Muscat to Bangalore: Oman Air have a policy that one parent gets a free bassinet seat but the other parent has to pay a premium to sit together with the family! Outrageous! They prefer to sell the other seat as a premium seat to unsuspecting customers looking for additional leg room and comfort and are oblivious to the likelihood that they will be stuck next to a crying baby and a bassinet which hampers their legroom! 4) BLR to MCT: The check in staff (two different members of staff!) tried to sell both bassinet seats to me as premium seats before I had to explain to them their own policy! 5) BLR to MCT: Oman Air operate this ridiculous luggage policy where you can carry up to 60kg of luggage between two adults but no 2 pieces of luggage can exceed 30kg in total. This leads to unnecessary hassle and delays for both passengers and Oman Air staff. 6) MCT to LHR: Upon take-off and after the seat belt sign was turned off, we requested a bassinet for our son who had fallen asleep in the mother’s arms. The stewardess returned with a drinks tray and said: ‘just a moment’! She obviously then only returned to fix the bassinet 30 mins later once drinks had been served for the entire flight! In general, it was a battle to get any type of service from the majority of Oman Air staff. I have to say that there were a few exceptions, whose service was very much appreciated e.g. the senior steward on the LHR-MCT flight who tried to appease us despite the shoddy cards he’d been dealt with by Oman Air and one of the check in staff at BLR who helped us reshuffle our luggage. However, this was not sufficient to want us to fly Oman Air again! The only reason to fly Oman Air is if it is the cheapest option and you’re not in need of any service i.e. single traveller just looking to get from A to B!

### "Wonderful experience"
Bangkok to Paris via Muscat. Wonderful experience, very friendly staff, good meals, impeccable service, comfortable seats. On some planes all seats have direct aisle access , so window seated passengers do not need jump over their neighbor.All this at an unbelievable price. Definitely recommended.

### "Narrow seats, little leg room"
Flew Oman Air from Muscat to Colombo. Internet check in swift, baggage drop-off swift. Emigration at Muscat airport is just dreadful, e-gates slow or defective, endless and chaotic lines at passport and security check. Took more than one hour to get the passport stamped – on the way out! It really is time for the new airport to open. Flight departed and arrived on time. Very old plane, no screens, no IFE, but clean and in good state of repair. Narrow seats, little leg room. 4-hour night flight departing at 2 am: lights stayed on, crew were busy almost all the time serving drinks and even a (admittedly very decent) hot meal, followed by a round of tea/coffee. I would have strongly preferred lights-out and some silence at this time of the night.

### "was pleased with service"
I traveled Oman Air on Jaipur to Dubai via Muscat  and was pleased with service and product quality. The planes were new and nicely serviced. Flights left on time and transfers were smooth. Crew did their best to make flying time comfortable.

### Oman Air customer review
I flew Bahrain to Delhi on the 7th February 2018. I really appreciate Oman Air management for upgrading my seat from economy class to business class. It was a really good experience flying business class with nice service and a delicious meal served.

### "the crew was friendly"
Paris to Karachi via Muscat in Oman Air business class. Had a lounge access at Paris to the Cathy Pacific lounge. Everything was ok but unfortunately the food served was not halal. When Oman air) gives access to a lounge belonging to another carrier they should make sure the meal provided at the lounge should be Halal. Onboard the aircraft meal was great but the breakfast was not as shown on the menu. The crew was friendly and loved the pajamas we got - really comfy. Amenity kit was not very impressive. Choice of movie was ok. Juices were fresh. would rate 8 out of 10.

### "was delayed by 4 hours"
Dubai to Muscat. Flight was delayed by 4 hours. The staff did not meet us at the gate which was announced. No explanation were given. No food or beverage were provided. Very bad experience I had today with Oman Air

### "service was very good"
London to Bangkok via Muscat. The first flight was in older plane A330-300, we got boarded along with economy passengers, one of the points paying for business is to be boarded without joining the queue, but this didn't happen. The seats were very good, full flat bed, food and service great, then we changed at Muscat where the terminal is old and dated, new one expected to be completed soon, they need it badly, used lounge which was decent. But had to go through security again twice! However we did get loaded as very last passengers on a separate bus, the plane was new Boeing 787, seats are 2x2x2 so I was surprised why they didn't design it as separate seating, bit awkward getting up for toilet etc when passenger next to you is asleep. Return journey time was put back by 6hrs we did get months notice, again no separate boarding, food onboard good but Muscat are a mess, security have no idea, had to queue with economy passengers and loaded on same bus, these are the things we pay not to do. For the price it was ok, not sure if I would use again unless they sort out the difference between boarding business and economy.The onboard crew did an excellent job, food was great and service was very good. I would score them 6/10 for business class.

### "They only served 2 meals"
Paris CDG to Manila via Muscat. They only served 2 meals (one at the start of the flight and one near the end of the flight). They never asked the standard, coffee, tea or juice. The meal was served without without smiling and quite in a hurry.

### "what was a terrible product"
Bangkok to Manchester via Muscat. Bangkok - Muscat Boeing 787 beautiful business class cabin with a nice 2-2-2 configuration all aisle access, lovely full flat bed seats and very comfortable. Entertainment: the screen is large however the choice is not as good as Emirates or Qatar but decent enough for the journey. Overall worked well Food & Beverage: Menus were handed over to all business class guests and the choice was varied and plentiful. The food on this leg was very good and all choices were available. Champagne was served chilled. Crew: Very attentive and courteous, could not fault. Job well done Overall: a very nice business class product and experience as one would expect. Short layover in Muscat, around 1hr 40mins or so. The airport is in desperate need of a facelift and looks and feels dirty, was glad to board the next flight. Muscat to Manchester an A330 Same 2-2-2 configuration all aisle access as the Boeing 787. Entertainment: less choice than on the Boeing 787 so it's below average and was not as responsive Food & Beverage: Well, where should I start. Warm champagne was served before taking off and again after even after addressing this. No food menus were handed out (big red flag! ), why? this all came clear when at both meals there were no choices. We were told what we could eat, totally unacceptable for any business class product. The food was basically awful. On this flight they did not even have ice available!! Something obviously went wrong in the preparation prior. Crew: Tried their best with what was a terrible product offered on this leg from the outset which I felt they knew. Overall: based on this flight (alone) we would never fly with Oman again, it really was a terrible business class experience and the 8 hours seemed to take forever even in those nice seats.

### "offer a good Business Class product"
Manchester to Bangkok via Muscat. Manchester – Muscat on time,  A330 Same 2-2-2 configuration all aisle access as the Boeing. Entertainment: For some reason the choice was better than what was on the Muscat to Manchester leg on the same aircraft type. Food & Beverage: Menus were given to all this time! All food choices were available and were tasty, we were praying we would not get the same service as Muscat – Manchester and we thankfully did not. Was thoroughly satisfied. Crew: All were friendly and polite and gave a great service Overall: a very nice business class product and experience as one would expect. Slept well as it was a night flight so the flight felt very short Muscat - Bangkok Date: 07/11/17 Flight: WY815 ( 09.00 ) Departure: On time Aircraft: Boeing 787 Beautiful business class cabin with a nice 2-2-2 configuration all aisle access, lovely full flatbed seats and very comfortable. Entertainment: the screen is large however the choice is not as good as Emirates or Qatar but decent enough for the journey. Overall worked well Food & Beverage: Menus were handed over to all business class guests and the choice was varied and plentiful. The food on this leg was very good and all choices were available. Champagne was served chilled. Crew: Very attentive and courteous, could not fault. Job well done Overall: a very nice business class product and experience as one would expect. Again slept well. Apart from the Muscat – Manchester leg of the journey which was terrible the rest of the 3 legs were of a high standard and all left on time and offered a great business class product. Would we fly with Oman again? Yes we would as they really do offer a good Business Class product at a fair price.

### "Usual excellent service"
London to Bangkok via Muscat. Usual excellent service. Clean plane, polite staff, decent leg-room and decent in-flight food. And at a good price of just £400. Good stuff! I really like this airline. There was a slight issue with the Movie choice on the Muscat to London leg but it was just a computer glitch. Normally there is plenty of choice. Book with confidence, Oman Air is a pleasant experience.

### "never fly again with Oman Air"
Koln to Muscat via Munich. Our connecting flight with Air Berlin (booked with Oman Air) was cancelled. No help from Oman air received. 25 Hours delayed for our flight and no compensation received. Our return flight with Oman Air was cancelled as Air Berlin rebooked with Etihad. Spent Hours with Oman Air on the phone and at the airport office to explain the issue. Air Berlin went bankrupt and Oman Air refuse to refund our expenses even if the entire flight was booked with them. Return flight with Oman Air was not good. No space for the legs and very bad food. Bad service on the ground. We will never fly again with Oman Air, far from other middle East airlines. However, Oman was a beautiful country!

### "Seats seemed very small"
London to Bangkok via Muscat. First time and the last time with Oman Air. Food was cheap, cabin crew with bad attitude and a low profile. Seats seemed very small and not comfortable, the connecting flight in Oman is not good

### "Miserable service and experience"
Dubai to Delhi via Muscat. Miserable service and experience. In Dubai, we kept in an non-airconditioned airplane prior to take off. The total wait, about an hour due to delays, was among the more miserable experiences. The temperature in the cabin was above 40 deg C. All the complaints fell on deaf ears. Muscat airport was a miserable experience, mayhem everywhere, with no coordination or control at the Oman Air checkin counters. I could go on about what a horrid experience this was. Bottom line — avoid Oman Air!

### "customer service poor"
The worst airline experience. From Muscat to Bangkok delayed around 6 hours and they do not update the time on the screen. The return flight from Muscat to Riyadh was also delayed 1 hour. When we called customer service they don't offer a true answer and just keep saying the flight is on schedule. First and last time to fly with Oman Air. Airport poor. Customer service poor also. Aircraft and staff not bad.

### "not flying Oman Air again"
Kuala Lumpur to London via Muscat. The flight from Kuala Lumpur was delayed by an hour. We were assured that the connecting flight to London in Muscat would wait for us. When we arrived in Muscat we were told the flight to London had left without us, and that we would be diverted to London via Doha, 6 hours later. We had to take a connecting flight to Doha with Qatar Airways and then another flight to London from there. The ground staff were awful and the Muscat airport dismal. We felt completely at a loss. A 12 hour flight to London ended up being close to 22 hours. Definitely not flying Oman Air again.

### "poor to mediocre facilities"
Flew Bengaluru to Manchester via Muscat. The whole process from check in to travel was average at the best. The check in facilities were so limited combined with poor bandwidth of the website, options including choosing child meals or wheelchair assistance etc were not available especially if you have bought the tickets via an agent. Again, after spending a substantial amount of time waiting for the seating options to show up on the website, most were already booked even after logging in immediately after opening of the 24hr window for check in before flying, so we ended up selecting seats in different parts of the flight which is far from ideal when travelling as a family with two young children. Neither the check in desk at departure or the transit were able to help, more disappointed and annoyed at the false information and blame game being played by the staff who were more interested in seeing us through rather than sorting out our problem. The inflight facilities were mediocre indeed with dated looking upholstery, no welcome for the kids or entertainment options for them, flights did not have TVs, when they did have televisions, most of the time touch screens do not work, headphones were as poor as one can get, did not transmit even 50% of the volume. Waited for at least 75 minutes for even water to be served in spite of asking for juice/water for the kids, meals arrived 150 minutes after boarding, again hungry irritable kids had to be managed, standard response from the staff that meals was not booked in advance, trying to explain this to the staff about the website issue was a waste of time. Again trying to explain to hungry kids needing to wait another 45 minutes after the neighbouring kids had their meals served was a challenging task. Add to this, they even missed serving us inflight snacks and drinks for the kids, I had walk to the pantry to remind them that we have not been served, no apologies, just a smile. All in all, a low cost airline which is unsuitable for longer journeys and for young families.

### "What disappointed me was the service"
Flying Oman Air used to be exceptionally pleasant. This has changed somewhat, as – quite obviously – cost-cutting measures were implemented. Check-in at MCT and DEL reasonably fast. No delays on any of the two legs. Seat comfort and leg room ok although not really good. What disappointed me was the service on both flights. The flight attendants were clearly not able to cope with full planes. Some spoke hardly any English, some were just very slow. Food on the way out was simply insulting. When it was my turn only the “vegetarian” option was left, which consisted of lukewarm soggy potatoes and rice! The non-veg on return was a tasteless Wiener-type sausage with rubbery mashed potatoes.

### "very limited leg space"
Flew Oman Air from Paris to New Delhi via Muscat. New plane but very limited leg space - quite horrendous actually. IFE was not switched on 45 minutes into the flight and had to remind the air hostess a couple of times. Good selection of movies, air hostess service and behaviour hands-off but efficient and food was quite decent. Otherwise a decent enough flight with ground service quite good and check-in was smooth.

### "On board service was good"
Flew from New Delhi to Paris via Muscat on economy. Flight from New Delhi to Muscat was nice and hassle-free. Check in was smooth, plane was new with a really cool IFE system. On board service was good and good selection of movies. Muscat to Paris flight was a little disappointing though. Not much legroom and IFE system a bit jaded but inflight service was pretty good and plane was pretty new. Overall okay experience and landed on time.

### "Online check in wasn't possible"
Frankfurt to Muscat. Web bookings seem to be a radical concept for Oman air. After booking was repeatedly contacted by the revenue protection team and needed to send a scanned copy of the credit card. The scanned copy was then lost and my ticket was blocked leading to a long time on the phone with the call center. Online check in wasn't possible unless you are a member of the frequent flyer program which wastes more time at the airport.

### "half the price of market average"
Paris to Kuala Lumpur via Muscat. Top notch airline, round trip flights in the three different cabins available for long haul, old business class, new suite business class and business class seats in leased planes from Kenyan Airways. Oman Air product ranks higher in terms of comfort and privacy than the Kenyan leased one. Avoid if possible leased planes are seat confort and privacy are a downgrade on Oman Air product. Service was outstanding, particular food, cabin staff usually from Asia and Oman for steward and on par with other carriers in the region and Asia. Connecting flights in muscat are hassle free as airport is small (new terminal by end year) and allow for little connecting time. Lounge in muscat is ok but no real shower facilities, shower spot in the toilets only. Overall, one of the best experience in terms of cabin confort and appearance and value for money, and service. Oman Air is a medium size carrier, and while that does bring some benefits in terms of customer service and experience, the network is limited but expanding. if booked in advance their business saver fare are half the price of market average which makes it the best value rate for business from europe to asia. few negatives, perhaps the lack of consistency in service and frequent flyer scheme not integrated in the main global schemes. Strongly recommend it.

### "it was a good experience"
I've been collecting miles and points from BA for decades and this is the first flight where I have switched to another airline because of the cuts. Oman Air compared favourably. The limo service at both ends helped, of course. The staff on board were excellent and friendly. The Champagne is Cristal and there are only six seats in first. The food was disappointing, in line with BA. The only negative was a rude staffer in the Oman Air office before departures in Muscat. She barely raised her eyes from checking her mobile phone to tell me she couldn't help me, almost sneering. But her two colleagues over-compensated and were very helpful. I've marked down the ground service because of her, but overall, it was a good experience.

### "standards were inconsistent"
London to Kuala Lumpur via Muscat. Check-in at LHR was ok, check-in was slow as only one counter open for web check-in. Boarding fine. Flight was OK, but cabin crew lacked personality or care for passenger. My wife spilled her wine and ended have to clean the aisle herself using a blanket as cabin crew serving took no interest in helping - very poor. Muscat connection was fine if a little rushed due to having to use bus to get from plane to terminal. Second flight was slightly better but again crew were like robots and unable to deal with anything outside the normal. Food on both flights was bland and tasteless like most airlines. At least all our luggage arrived! Return flight - horrendous experience at check in at KL. Waited 45 minutes in the web check-in line before being served - again only one counter for web in was open. The normal check-in line was moving faster, but we were told to wait in web check-in line. We had earlier in the day used AirAsia and managed to check in the same luggage in 5 minutes using bag drop facility. What is the point of web check-in Oman Air? When we complained to the Oman Air staff they just looked at us with a blank expression and had no idea how to deal with the situation. Their excuse was a silver card member was checking in for their family of over 7 members (who were not present at check-in) with over 10 suitcases. If they were silver card member shouldn't they have used Business Class check-in counter? It was a terrible start to the return journey and the airline representative was completely useless and tried deflect blame - very unprofessional. Return flights were ok, but boarding was a mess as the aircraft hadn't even arrived and passengers were told to get to gate - so all passengers queued and waiting to get into gate. Flight was ok - crew a bit more personable and caring although even they were getting frustrated with some of the passengers (not used to flying). Connection in Muscat was again rushed and hectic. Last flight was fine and felt more civilised after the previous flight. Food was edible. IFE was ok, but lacked variety found on other airlines. The customer service standards were inconsistent both on the ground and in the air. Aircraft were clean and spacious and the airline is value for money - the main reason for choosing the airline. Oman Air still needs to work hard to get to the standards of Emirates and Far Eastern airlines - particularly customer services.

### "had left one bag in Muscat"
London to Kuala Lumpur return via Muscat. Return tickets bought via DialAFlight. DialAFlight had split me and my parents by gender, so I had to check-in four times. However, this was only made more difficult by Oman Air's confusing website. Our first flight from London is the one of four that I recall going nicely. In transit at Muscat we had to go through security, and take ride buses to board the plane. Upon arrival in Kuala Lumpur, we discovered they had left one bag in Muscat, and spent an hour and a half enquiring when it would be returned. For our return, I had checked-in online to assign seats for KUL-MCT at around 1220 which would later prove to be futile. Getting our boarding passes was even more stressful. We arrived at the airport around 1930, and after speaking to the check-in staff, we were informed that all three of our names were not on register for the flight. It was only after we found this out that other passengers had the same issue. The staff checking us in tried to fix the issue which took one and a half hours, delaying the flight to 2220. We were assigned new seats that I deliberately avoided in the first place. Check-in aside, the flight was pleasant. By the time we landed in Muscat, our connecting flight to London already taken off. We were put on the next flight which was just under 12 hours later. The airport then arranged for a night's stay at the Golden Tulip Seeb Hotel. Our seats on this flight were less than pleasant. At the very back, overhead storage space was occupied by flight supplies so our bags had to go under the seats in front of us.

### "not travel this airline again"
Paris to Kuala Lumpur via Muscat. The checkin at Paris was good, Oman uses Cathay's lounge which is a decent lounge. The flight got delayed by 4.5 hours with little information from ground crew. Once we landed in Muscat having missed our connections, none of the staff knew how to deal with passengers with missed connections. People were told to go and queue at one counter only to be told to go to another counter and queue up again. It took nearly three hours to arrange a hotel and an alternative flight for me. I was very disappointed with the lack of coordination of the ground staff. I would not travel with this airline again.

### "service and food quality is just average"
Flew Business Class recently with Oman Air from Jakarta to Frankfurt via Muscat. Seats are ok, but service and food quality is just average. Etihad has better food offering and much better service. Business Class Lounge in Muscat is also disappointing. There are only seats that are not very comfortable when you have 2 or more hours of layover. Food is also very limited. Turkish Airlines Lounge in Istanbul is much better. Etihad lounge in Abu Dhabi also has better food. Muscat airport is also very small, nothing much to do, you have to get off the plane on staircase and take a shuttle bus to the airport. No cell phone coverage here in Muscat if you have Google Fiber. Overall I would not recommend flying Oman Air unless you get a much lower price than Etihad, Emirates or Turkish.

### "complaints ignored every time"
We have recently made 1 trip with Oman Air from Abu Dhabi via Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne and 3 trips with Oman Air from Abu Dhabi to Manchester via Muscat. Every time there has been an issue. We have contacted Oman Air and followed their complaints procedure and have been ignored every time. We are very disappointed with the poor customer service and incompetence shown by Oman Air. Their staff are rude and unhelpful. Abu Dhabi to Melbourne via Muscat and Kuala Lumpur. Flight WY632 between Muscat and Kuala Lumpur. Our bags went missing. We filed a report at Kuala Lumpur and were assured that Oman Air would contact us within 24 hours. That never happened. We spent 5 days of a 9 day holiday without our clothes. The bags eventually turned up on the 5th day which involved a 4hr round trip to collect them. We made numerous phone calls to Oman Air during this time and staff were very unhelpful. We raised a complaint with Oman Air and received a very unhelpful reply from Customer Relations. They ignored all of our replies to this email. We raised another complaint for which they acknowledged receipt - and then ignored. Abu Dhabi to Manchester via Muscat on 13th May 2017. Inbound flight WY634 and WY105 from Muscat to Abu Dhabi was delayed so the connecting flight from Muscat to Manchester was missed. No representatives present at the airport to help us apart from on female member of staff in a distant office dealing with all irate customers and missed connections. It took so long for her to organise that the first Etihad direct flight to Manchester was missed and the next flight was several hours later. This flight was going to London. There was a shuttle provided by BA to Manchester. When we arrived in Manchester, our bags were not there. We arrived in Manchester at 1am, Oman Air promised our bag would be delivered the following morning; they arrived at 8pm – nearly 24hr late. I also had my 7yr old son with me. Manchester to Abu Dhabi via Muscat - Flight WY633 on 18th May 2017. The flight was delayed so the connecting flight was missed. The aircraft did not make up the time during the journey and this was despite promises from Oman Air staff that the connecting flight to Abu Dhabi would wait. This incurred a 5hr wait in Muscat Airport for me and my 7yr old son. We were put on an Etihad flight. Manchester to Abu Dhabi via Muscat. Flight WY0106 on 4th June 2017. The flight was delayed so the connecting flight was missed. The aircraft did not make up the time during the journey and this was despite promises from Oman Air staff that the connecting flight to Abu Dhabi would wait. This incurred a 5hr wait in Muscat Airport. No food or water was offered to me or my 7yr old son. We were put on an Etihad flight.

### "worst I've experienced for long haul"
London Heathrow to Goa via Muscat. I've flown with many many different airlines and Oman Air are the worst I've experienced for long haul. On my flight out from Heathrow, my seat sliding mechanism was broken which meant that when I stretched out the seat would slide out and backrest would fall back. I complained and nothing was done about it on the flight. On return flight, my entertainment unit didn't work. I complained, and again they didn't do anything or pretend to care. So an 8 hour flight without any form of entertainment was hell. I was suffering from a stomach bug on my way back to London and needed water because I was getting dehydrated. I got up and walk to the galley and asked nicely if I could have some water because I'm not well. I got a rude response of "Yeah I will bring it to you", what she really wanted to say is "go away". I just stood there looking at the staff until she gave me water. I've never experienced such rude service in my life on an airplane. My experience of the connecting Oman Air flights between Muscat and Goa was a complete different story. They were great, exactly what I expect from an airline. The short flights would get 5*s.

### "quite pleasant and on time"
Muscat to Salalah return on Oman Air. Both 80 min flights full, still quite pleasant and spot on time. Check-in in Muscat ok, in Salalah (new airport) excellent. Food on Oman Air short distance flights is inedible. I would much prefer just water and a (good) coffee or tea. New Oman Air lounge in Salalah is quiet, very good.

### "very positive experience"
Flew London Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur via Muscat return with Oman Air. Fantastic experience, now I want to only travel with them. Seats in economy cabin are comfortable 2x4x2, attention of the crew was good all time . We were very lucky and got upgraded to premium seats on our way back so was even more comfortable. Generally very positive experience and I would highly recommend the airline.

### "showing our train ticket to Singapore"
On checkin they said we couldn't board unless we showed proof of an exit flight from Malaysia. Despite showing our train ticket to Singapore, they insisted that this is not proof. We were forced to buy a ticket at the airport at somewhat inflated prices. I wasn't aware the front seats in each section were premium, only discovering this when reaching the cabin. Even though they were empty and I offered onboard the aircraft to pay the difference, we were denied this seating by staff. Therefore my 9 month old baby had no cot for the journey. The front seats were empty. Finally they lost one of my bags, just to stick the knife in I suppose.

### "really good service"
London Heathrow to Delhi return via Muscat. Surprisingly excellent, and consistently so across four flights. Plenty of leg room, good food, really good service, flights were on time and the price was the lowest available. We're actually considering visiting Oman as a result - not a country we'd ever considered visiting before, but I suppose part of the objective of becoming a 'hub' is to attract more tourism. I'd also highlight the Francophone hostess on the flight from Muscat to Delhi who went out of her way to be welcoming on what was a busy flight.

### "an excellent all round experience"
Manila to London Heathrow via Muscat. I was slightly apprehensive about my return trip, due to how impressed I was with the outward bound flights. To my delight, the same high standards were met - professional staff from start to finish, clean and very comfortable aircraft and excellent food served with a smile. At 6ft tall it was a joy to get adequate leg room, sadly not available on other airlines. The short stopover went without any problems at all with only a very short delay. The only small complaint was the cleanliness of the toilets onboard, but this was just just poor passenger hygiene. For the price, this was an excellent all round experience.

### "crew was brilliant"
Oman Air from Frankfurt to Colombo via Muscat. Aircraft from Frankfurt to Muscat (A330-200) 7 years old, Muscat to Colombo (A330-200) 2 years old. On the way back A330-300 registration number A40-BY (2 years old) and B737-900 1 year old. In all A330 in economy class a lot of space between the rows. We were positively surprised. I have never flew in an aircraft with this amount of space. In my opinion, the Oman Air A330 with the configuration 2-4-2 is one of the top economy class - I would risk to say that it was better than Emirates A380 economy class. The crew was brilliant we can't complain. The food very good. The only thing that I would improve it is the inflight entertainment system - always some kind of problem even in 2 years old planes. Despite great choice of films and games for kids always touch screen problems, we had to change headphones 2 times, the connectors between headphones and the system. The crew was trying to help but the screens were simply broken. Good thing the flights were not full so we could change the seats. Muscat Airport is a very small and basic (new one has been built and it is a matter of months when they move in to the new premises - it looks very impressive from outside). What we did not like is the very long annoying music during take off and landing in all planes and the ground Oman Air crew at the Muscat airport. There is no priority for passengers with kids to board the plane (Emirates are better in that matter).

### "no kind of assistance offered"
Milan to Kuala Lumpur via Muscat. Oman Air was voted Best Airline Economy three years in a row, so I assumed they would be a safe option. In Muscat, we were boarded, and then needed to sit for more than two hours on a very hot plane, with no water or snacks offered, only to be disembarked back into the airport. I informed the ground staff that the majority of the customers had no idea which gate we should go to. After another two hours of confusion, we were re-loaded into another plane. Arriving more than four hours late to Kuala Lumpur, I had missed my connecting flight, I asked for some assistance but I was simply told to rebook and it wasn't their problem. I needed to spend 8 hours in KLIA, my bags were lost, there was no Oman Air staff to be contacted, no meal vouchers or any kind of assistance offered. I missed an important business event the following day and had massive out of pocket expenses to rebook a last minute flight to Australia. Delays happen, I understand. But the attitude of both the ground staff in Oman and Kuala Lumpur was deplorable. Despite repeated efforts to contact the airline, no response from the 5 emails and forms has been responded to. On a side note, it was the worst airplane food I have ever experienced. It was in inedible. The entertainment system was extremely limited compared to the other international airlines I've flown.

### "Overall quality very good"
Flew Oman Air to from Milan to Bangkok via Muscat by A330 and Boeing 787. Overall quality very good, both in booking (seat selection available for free), check in, service, food and IFE (large number of movies in itlaian on board). Muscat airport is a bit old, but transfer has been quick and smooth. One of the 787 had a high density configuration with little legroom, while the other and the A330 had normal legroom for a long range flight.

### "needs to improve vastly"
We booked a round trip from Bangalore to Dubai via Muscat. Both times, our flights were delayed by close to 2 hrs, due to which we missed (or they made us miss) our connection flights to Dubai. The ground staff were very unhelpful and we had to literally run around to gt the next flight. The first time, we had to wait about 4-5 hrs to take the next flight and the second time, we were provided Etihad Airways to Abu Dhabi (from Muscat) and from Abu Dhabi to Bangalore. The 3.5 hr flight from Bengaluru to Dubai took us close to 12 hrs to reach (including the time we checked in). With a 2 year kid, it was a nightmare. In short, take this flight if you really want to go through this pain. Oman Air, being a national carrier for Oman, needs to improve vastly.

### "cabin crew were very good"
I was very pleased to see the way that the seat on WY102, LHR to Muscat were laid out in business class, 1-2-1, but unfortunately my seat 10A controls did not work properly so I could only recline partly which mean that I could not sleep. Muscat airport still does not have air bridges even though their airport is now over 2 years behind the official opening date, which means that you have to walk up and down stairs and be transported by bus to and from the plane. The cabin crew were very good, the food and drinks only so-so. Muscat to MNL was also on an A330 but with new seating layout, 2-2-2, which I think is a backwards step, but then they can get more bodies on board by using this layout and one has to remember that airlines are not being run for the benefit of passengers but as a business enterprise to make a profit. Food and drinks were also average on this flight, CC were all good, I didn't need to ring the bell as they seemed to anticipate all of my needs, the only 2 criticisms that I have to make is that you have to eat when they want to feed you and not on demand like some other middle eastern airlines offer, also that they only serve you neat drinks, no cocktails etc available. Did not have time to try their lounge in Muscat due to very short 1hour 40 minutes layover time which was shortened by having to use buses to and from the planes, otherwise if they have air bridges I would recommend them especially for their low prices. Maybe their new airport will be open by the time I return in April 2017 and hopefully they will have rectified the fault with the seat, because I am also booked on seat 10A for both flights on my return journey.

### "disappearing in the galleys"
Most of my comments on my last review from CDG to MCT apply to the flight from Bangkok to Muscat. Both night flights on same aircraft type. However this particular flight was delayed for over 40 minutes at the gate by airport traffic control. During this time, I would have expected the cabin crew to offer business class passengers another round of drinks instead of disappearing in the galleys. In-flight catering was excellent. I tried unsuccessfully to buy duty free items on board.Flight attendants mixed up my order and then told me that the selected items were not available.

### "Good food and drinks"
Paris to Muscat. First flight in Boeing 787 business class. Seat configuration 2x2x2 same as in renovated A330 business class and same seat with easy to adjust positions and easy access to the aisle even when you have a window seat. My negative points are the same as in economy cabin: electronic window shades are slow to adjust and cabin temperature is too high. In-flight service on this particular flight was discreet and efficient. Good food and drinks.

### "inflight service all the way was good"
My wife and I flew Oman Air from Kuala Lumpur to Heathrow with a change of plane in Muscat, both legs on Airbus A330s. On the first stage the aircraft was full with seats in the 32in pitch. The second leg had the better 34in pitch. This flight was less than half full meaning every passenger had at least 2 seats to themselves. The inflight service all the way was good, hot meals, snacks, alcohol and plenty of cold drinks. Crews very good.

### "flight experience was good"
London to Bangkok via Muscat with Oman Air. Surprisingly one of the best economy trips I have done. Very smooth check in, flight experience was good, nice aircraft. The leg room is 10/10, best economy leg room I have experienced compared to other major airlines. I was able to stretch and fully extend my feet at 6ft tall. Plane food could be better however entertainment system was full of movies and very good. I would recommend Oman Air and likely to fly with them again to Asia given how cheap it is and the high quality provided.

### "both short flights were pleasantly uneventful"
Muscat to Abu Dhabi return with Oman Air. Both short flights were pleasantly uneventful. Check-in smooth at both ends, departures sharp on time with early arrivals on both legs. The seats are tight but sufficient for such short flights. (The 787 is normally used for longer legs where the legroom might become an issue). My only criticism is the food offering, which consisted of small prepacked snack boxes with bone dry inedible somethings, all individually plastic wrapped. Better just serve a water and some nuts or a small sandwich.

### "avoid Boeing 787 aircraft"
Bangkok to Muscat was a great experience with decent legroom on an A330-200. The return flight was a very different story. The seating on their new fleet of Boeing 787 aircraft is tighter than any Asian budget carrier. I have done hundreds of night flights, but this was among the worst flight ever. I could not sleep a single minute. I like Oman Air, but I will try avoid Boeing 787 aircraft in the future.

### "cabin crew are cheerful"
This is my second time flying with Oman Air on the same flight WY824 from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Similar to the previous time, the boarding process was smooth, flight was on time. Both the ground staff and cabin crew are cheerful. However, unlike my previous experience, there was no refreshments onboard this 40 minutes flight. The seatbelt sign was on the whole flight and no one was allowed to use the toilet. Well it is understandable because I think this is because this fifth freedom route is stopping by the end of this month. Overall I still recommend this airline for its comfort and price tag for this short haul flight.

### "would definitely recommend"
London to Bangkok via Muscat. Very happy with all aspects of the flight, clean aircraft , good service and food was satisfactory for airline food. Rather slow at check in at Heathrow terminal 4, but at 5am everything seemed slow at this terminal. Staff on both flights were helpful and friendly, would definitely recommend and use again.

### "ground staff was unfriendly "
London to Hyderabad via Muscat. Flight departed with an hour delay at Heathrow, for which no reason or information was provided. Flight landed with an hour delay. There was no announcement or fast track service available for travellers with less connection time. It took 20 min to open the doors. The ground staff attitude was unfriendly to say the least, it was rude and careless. There was no urgency to serve customers with missed connections. Food and cabin service was average at best. Avoid this airline unless you want to be spend a day at Muscat airport.

### "best airline I flew with"
London to Goa return via Muscat with Oman Air. Best airline I flew with, friendly staff and excellent food, good aircraft. Crew was helpful throughout the journey, really pleased. I will definitely fly with Oman Air again, and would recommend.

### "Cabin Crew was very professional and friendly"
We flew from Munich to Bangkok via Muscat. Ground Staff at Munich were friendly and helpful. Dinner was served relatively quickly after take-off, the quality was average. The Cabin Crew was very professional and friendly. IFE on the A332 is ok, but there could a wider selection regarding movies. The airport in Muscat is decent, however, the announcements were extremly loud and were repeated every 45 seconds, which was annoying after a while. Cabin Crew on the MCT-BKK-Leg were again very professional and friendly. Overall, we enjoyed our flights with Oman Air and would fly with again with them.

### "best flight I have ever flown"
Flew on Oman Air flight WY824 from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Flight was delayed for 24 minutes due to traffic congestion in Changi Airport. But we arrived 4 minutes ahead of schedule. The legroom of this A330 aircraft is amazingly big, especially for the 40 minutes flight to KL. The touchscreen IFE was very responsive, just that headsets were not provided for this short flight. The cabin crews are very helpful and friendly. The refreshments include a cookie with water and apple juice, you may also pre order your own meal online at no extra charge. I am a frequent flyer on Singapore to KL route and I can say that this is the best flight I have ever flown on this route.

### "a very comfortable flight"
Dubai to Mumbai via Muscat. My 3rd time taking Oman Air on this route. This time had taken this airline just to try the Boeing 787 on DXB-MCT. I must say it turned out to be a very comfortable flight. The only issue was that the IFE did not work as system was down. On the 737 for BOM-MCT: very comfortable seats, good legroom, great IFE and relaxing on-board ambiance. For the crew, they are polite and good. However, very reserved. Food onboard was reasonable, but disappointed with the fruit platter I ordered. Let down as opposed to what competition offers, Transit was alright, As I had lounge access. Otherwise MCT airport is not a very pleasant airport to transit at, This has been the airline of my choice as it has great connections to the Indian subcontinent and I enjoy my experience each time I fly.

### "service onboard flights really good"
This is our first time flying Oman Air. For last minute booking from Frankfurt to Kuala Lumpur via Muscat, Oman Air offered the lowest price compared to other airlines. The price was really unbeatable. Overall the service on board for all our flight sectors was really good. Flight attendants were friendly, warm and helpful. Food and entertainment were OK, nothing to complain about. Seats in our flight from FRA to Muscat and Muscat to Kuala Lumpur had a spacious legroom, even with my husband's long legs he had no problem stretching them. As for our return flights Kuala Lumpur to Muscat and Muscat to FRA, legrooms are tight and those with long legs had to suffer the whole journey. Besides tight legrooms, the entertainment system were all fully touch screen control and every time the passenger behind me touching his screen, my seat being pushed forward, which disturbed me big time especially when I was trying to sleep. It would be better if a hand held controller is being used. One small glitch happened during our flight from Muscat to FRA. We were being transported from boarding lounge to the plane by a bus after a long wait at the lounge. When the bus reached the plane, the cleaning works were not done and all of us were being locked inside the bus for like 40 mins and the air-conditioning were not functioning well. I guess there was a lack of communication. With the unbeatable price offered, Oman Air is another contender in the Gulf region.

### "cabin crew were extremely rude"
Flew Oman Air from Muscat to Salalah. Nice Aircraft and comfortable seats. However there were no air vents to cool passengers. The plane was hot. The cabin crew were extremely rude. Just one muffin served for 1hr 45 minutes. No coffee or tea on the meal service despite being in the morning flight. The crew never smiled or made passengers feel welcome - poor service.

### "staff very friendly2
Muscat to Chennai with Oman Air. Nice journey. Food was good and as usual all staff were very friendly. Toilets were clean and good inflight entertainment. Very comfy seats for this 3 hour journey. The lounge was also very good and flights on time. Would recommend.

### "there was no entertainment"
The flight was delayed a bit in Dammam and also in Muscat which was fortunate because I had a very short connecting time. The aircraft used on the Dammam to Muscat sector vas very old and there was no entertainment at all. A small sandwich was served which was enough for an hour and half flight. The aircraft used on the Muscat to Bangalore sector seemed to be a bit newer and the seats were comfortable but there was no entertainment as it did not have IFE. The cabin crew were really very friendly. I felt restless and felt bored because some entertainment is needed for a 4 hr flight

### "food was pretty grim and sporadic"
This was the return flight. Flying Oman Air saved us money, but I'd also read very decent reviews and the timings weren't too bad so it was an obvious choice. Overall, from a cost perspective, it was worth it. Oman Air is perfectly decent, although there were some IFE and food issues. On the way out from Singapore to London Heathrow we chose the 13 hour stop in Muscat so we could get a rest in a hotel (we were traveling with a three year old). This was easy enough, but as our son didn't cooperate it just added more time onto an exhausting journey. On the way back we had the simple one-hour change in Muscat, which was simple and quick enough. On both flights the Kuala Lumpur stop of around an hour was simple enough, and on the way back the flight crew let my son see the cockpit - something I've not experienced since (I think) 1980. There were IFE problems on both legs - usually frozen touch screens, or language options that resisted being set to anything but German. This was a major problem, although the ability to use the IFE even when on the ground was useful. The other big issue was the food on the flight back, in the middle of Ramadan. There wasn't much of a service from LHR (I'd have expected a meal on take off at 2050), but the real problem was Muscat - KL/SG. I can only imagine that Ramadan meant that the kitchens in Muscat were barely working, as the food was pretty grim and sporadic (most passengers were Muslim and busy fasting until the end of the flight). The cabin crew were good. Two stand out. One helped me secure a spare couple of seats at the very back, giving my wife and son a bit more space in the centre seats. When I asked for a wine she answered with, "One? Two? Three? Just two? Then just ask if you want more. That is excellent and grown up. The other was very friendly and helped out a lot, especially when my son vomited during the extremely bumpy 6 or so hours almost from take off in Muscat to the coast of Malaysia (monsoon season in the Indian Ocean), and got my son onto the flight deck. As an airline, then, it's not a top offering, but with plenty to recommend it if you want to save cash. I also hear that Oman is excellent for exploring if you have time.

### "cabin crews were polite and efficient"
Flight WY132, 23/05/2016 from Paris CDG to Muscat and WY817, 24/05/2016 from Muscat to Bangkok were operated by the same aircraft, A40SA. Both flights left on time and arrived at destination ahead of schedule. Meal service was a bit rushed as is often the case on night flights but food was decent and cabin crews were polite and efficient. Only criticism was the cabin temperature, too hot for my personal taste. I also regret the seat width and pitch of the A330 previously used on these sectors.

### "pleasant flights on both sectors"
Pleasant flights on both sectors with Oman Air. WY818, Bangkok to Muscat on 21/06/2016 was nearly full but boarding was reasonably smooth considering that several passengers needed wheelchair assistance and many others were not frequent travellers. WY818 landed almost one hour ahead of schedule due to strong rear winds thus giving me time to use the lounge before continuing to CDG on WY 131. On both flights food was good. It seems to me that Oman Air is back to the quality of meals they offered in 2013/2014. Cabin crew was above average, beeing pleasant, efficient and attentive. Cabin temperature was again too high. Is it a general problem with this type of aircraft? Improved selection of audio entertainment.

### "food acceptable but not fantastic"
Flew from Dubai to Bangkok via Muscat for a long weekend. All flights out and back very punctual, with return leg from BKK to MCT arriving well before schedule. Pleasant cabin crew but food acceptable but not fantastic. IFE choices not so great and not a patch on the variety that you get on Emirates for example but the screens on the 787 are perfectly fine. Older 737 used on DXB to MCT leg which is fine for a short hop. 787 used on the MCT to BKK leg was very pleasant and not too busy with no one sat next to me in both directions. Used Airmiles for this particular trip but checked pricing on the Oman air website and was pleasantly surprised to see that the flight I booked would have cost 895 AED inclusive of taxes. Despite the shortcomings with the food and IFE choice, would use again.

### "staff disengaged from customers"
Salalah to Muscat for a relatively short Oman Air domestic flight. Seating comfortable with good leg room and entertainment not available. Staff went through the motions with service offering a snack and drink. No interaction from staff otherwise and they seemed quite disengaged from customers. All other aspects acceptable for a 90 minute flight.

### "boutique airline has great potential"
Business Class seat very comfortable. Cabin and toilets kept spotlessly clean. Limited choice of entertainment programmes. Crew were well presented. The flight was empty in both Business and Economy class on both outward and return sectors. London Heathrow - Muscat and return with Oman Air. On LHR-MCT sector, the crew were pleasant and helpful. Problem on arrival at MCT - booked chauffeur service did not show. Ground staff at Sales desk were not very helpful. Had to book a rental car to get to hotel. When I phoned customer services to point this out, the response was not sympathetic and appeared to distance airline from ground services offering. Seems that staff are not empowered to resolve complaints. This was verified at check in for the return sector, when I was asked to email Customer Services. That is never the answer. Anyway, I did email them, and am still awaiting an acknowledgement. On MCT - LHR sector the loads were again light. Crew did not engage with passengers much, despite the opportunity to do so given the small number of passengers. Crew seemed inexperienced and immature. Such a shame - because the "hard" product is quite good. Food is well presented in Business Class, but wine choice is limited and food portion size is small. This boutique airline has great potential, but currently is not up there with the best in terms of interest in passengers.

### "cabin crew good, airport staff not so "
Heathrow to Bangkok via Muscat with Oman Air. 1 hour late leaving London and meant to leave Muscat 8.45pm but flight delayed. Very little information and people getting very angry. We finally left around 1.30am and got into Bangkok 11am local time. Missed connection and had to buy another ticket. Flight and cabin crew good, airport staff not so good. Didn't seem to know what to do - very cheap flight but will not fly with them again.

### "crew behaved commendably"
Muscat to Dubai and return in the evening in economy. Check in was friendly and efficient and both flights were punctual. It would have been two uneventful short hops if it hadn't been for the weather. On the return flight Muscat was covered with a thick layer of thunder clouds, and the flight went through quite severe turbulences on descend. The landing had to be aborted only some 25 m above the runway, and the pilots re-approached from the other direction. The crew behaved commendably. Cabin staff stayed calm and friendly, and the pilots kept the passengers informed throughout the challenging phase in a reassuring manner.

### "legroom good on the A330"
Dubai to Mumbai via Muscat. My 2nd time with Oman Air and first time on their A330. The legroom was good on the A330. On MCT-BOM, it was the Boeing 737-900ER. Seat pitch was tight in comparison to the smaller Boeing 737-800. Plane very modern and best configured in my opinion. Food was good. Cabin crew looked the part and were very pleasant in approach, however, they need abit of refinement when it comes to customer service. It's the little things that count. IFE was excellent and very quick in response. It's a bit hit and miss with this airline.

### "an excellent service"
Muscat to London with Oman Air, and an excellent service in business class. They arranged pick up from home and a car to hotel in London. Lounge in Muscat is quite small but has just about everything you would need. While I do not like the style of the Business Class seats, they are very comfortable. Food and drinks service was good and served by cabin crew who were helpful and friendly.

### "it was total chaos"
Our Oman Air flight to Milan was cancelled and it was total chaos. First we were told we had to go to a hotel (we were in transit from Bangkok), we could not stay in transit. After filling papers to leave the airport, we were told that we could stay in transit and that a plane was getting ready for us - in 4 hours! Again, chaos. They told us that we could have some food, but did not say where. 1 hour later we finally had something to eat after loads of people started complaining about the lack of communication. Otherwise, out of the 4 flights we did: good inflight entertainment but the screens don't seem to be always working, once my seat was stuck on seating position, the food was ok, flight attendants were nice.

### "inconsistent level of service"
Two flights on 5th April with Oman Air and they couldn't have been more contrasting. The check-in staff at Kuala Lumpur were ridiculously slow and said nothing to us when we finally reached the counter. I have never experienced a 'silent check-in' before. As she handed us our boarding passes, she said: 'Gate C4. 9 o'clock'. That was the entire extent of her vocabulary. No smile, no 'have a nice flight', nothing. The cabin crew on the Kuala Lumpur-Muscat sector were the surliest I have ever encountered. Even the basics were carried out without cheer and with looks of utter disinterest and irritation. The child's meal we requested for our daughter did not materialise, and the flight attendant immediately assured us that this was because we hadn't actually booked one. On showing her the booking, she instantly blamed the caterers, saying they 'didn't deliver the correct number of meals'. No hint of an apology at any stage. The in-flight meals were surprisingly average and these were delivered hurriedly and without a smile .The seats were excellent though. The 34 inch seat pitch is one of the best and the width and recline were both very good. IFE easy to use and had a good selection for all ages. The crew on the Muscat-Milan Malpensa were absolutely brilliant. I mentioned the child meal issue after boarding and the flight attendant immediately sorted it out. Friendly, helpful and welcoming. This crew could not have been more different from the unpleasant team on the first sector. Oman Air has serious issues with their Malpensa flights however. Every single day for the last 2 weeks, WY 143 has departed Muscat in excess of an hour late (and often much later than that). We felt lucky to arrive in Milan at 20 25, just 60 minutes behind schedule! I would recommend Oman Air for the excellent legroom and wide seats, but their inconsistent level of service needs to be remedied.

### "pleasant and uneventful journey"
Agent booked us on Oman Air from Bahrain to Munich via Muscat and we returned back through Milan. Price was economical for two adults and two young children, and happy to report a pleasant and uneventful journey. Flights were on time, staff was friendly, food was good and baggage all arrived complete and on time. Leg room was very generous. Aircraft were slightly dated but inflight entertainment was good. Transfer at Muscat was quick and the transit times were between an hour or two both ways. Would recommend the airline to others and would not hesitate to fly them again. The Muscat airport is a bit old but the new one is under construction.

### "would not recommend Oman Air"
London to Delhi via Muscat return with Oman Air. Our flight was two hours late, most of which time we spent sitting on the plane with no refreshments offered. The delay was due to the flight paperwork not being in order, so Muscat had to be contacted to arrange this - surprising such a fundamental item wasn't organised correctly. Because of the delay, we only just made our onward flight, which was overbooked so we were upgraded, but anyone arriving after us didn't get on the flight. We turned out to be not so lucky when our luggage did not follow us to Delhi until the following day. No one at the airport seemed that interested and said our cases would be on the next day's flight. When they arrived at our hotel at 7pm, one case was ripped badly and the other had been broken into, the lock disappeared and the contents rifled through. The service company replaced the damaged case at Heathrow. Really would not recommend Oman Air, as know of someone else whose case was delayed on return from Delhi However, good seat pitch and recline, and cabin crew helpful

### "would definitely use again"
As a budget conscious traveller, I search/travel on the cheapest flights I can find (I exclude certain airlines for safety), and I found return flight to GOA for less than £400 with Oman Air. I was not expecting much from my flight experience but the planes I flew on were the modern versions, good seat pitch, excellent IFE. The cabin crew were very efficient in what they did - as said by many, you don't see them that much during the flight. But as with any long journey on a plane it is good to stretch your legs, so you walk down to the galley for any extra drinks you want. The food was not to my taste but it was perfectly edible - they do offer alcoholic drinks before your meal and with your meal - if you want more after that you have to use your call button or walk to the galley. Transit was very straightforward, no walkways direct off the plane, you are coached to/from the plane. A new airport is being constructed which will have these amenities. Terminal itself is ok for passengers, 2hrs free WiFi, selection of overpriced shops/eateries. All of my flights arrived early. All in all an excellent journey, I would definitely use again if the price is right.

### "service was inefficient"
Goa to Zurich via Muscat with Oman Air. The inflight Entertainment system did not start for a minimum of 30 minutes. Service was inefficient and the food one of the worst we ever had, compared to other airlines. Plastic cutlery, everything looks cheap and tastes cheap. In other airlines, the flight attendants walk around regularly to provide tea/coffee or water, but in Oman Air you do not see them at all. A short time before landing they rushed with providing sandwiches but already after some rows got them, the cheese sandwiches were out of stock and only beef available.

### "pleasant and efficient cabin crew"
Although I fly regularly on Oman Air long haul flights, this was my first experience with a regional "ethnic" service and was surprised to be the only European passenger on both sectors. Check-in in Muscat was fast as usual. Check-in at Chittagong was equally efficient. On the return flight Chittagong to Muscat, as the business class cabin was empty and the economy class apparently overbooked, I was one of seven passengers to be reassigned a seat in the business cabin shortly before boarding, I am very satisfied with the 32" pitch of economy class but the comfort of the business class seat, with 40" pitch is extremely good. Pleasant and efficient cabin crew outbound, unsmiling but equally efficient cabin crew on the return flight. Food satisfactory. On both sectors, drinks were served after the meal and limited to water and softdrinks on the return flight, while a choice of beverages (incl. alcohol and coffee) were offered out of MCT. Inflight entertainment from small dropdown screens, bad audio quality.

### "was a pleasant experience"
Dubai to Mumbai via Muscat with Oman Air. Flew one of the older 737s on DXB-MCT, crew were warm and friendly. Snack provided was fine for the 40min flight. Reached 30mins before my next departure which left not only me, but many passengers tense. The ground staff were helpful. MCT-BOM flight was a pleasant experience, crew were professional. A new Boeing 737 with Sky interior mood lighting and latest IFE. Food was really good, however the quantity could have been abit better. IFE, very easy to use but would appreciate more variety. Have 1 more trip with the airline and looking forward to it.

### "customer service is a mess"
In July 2015, Oman Air had a delay of 4,5 hours so we arrived too late in Muscat to get the flight to frankfurt. I had to wait for 10 hours at the airport, and Oman Air gave me a flight to Munich instead of Frankfurt at 2.00 am on the next day. Oman Air is not willing to pay compensation for the loss suffered. The customer service is a mess - they don't want to help.

### "seat pitch comfortable"
Oman Air from Jakarta to Madinah via Muscat. Flight price was competitive and cheaper than other airlines. The service was good but older aircraft from Jakarta to Muscat. Cabin crew nice and meals good. The aircraft needs improvement for inflight entertainment but I really surprised with the seat pitch which is large and comfortable.

### "crew did nothing about this"
Trip was okay with Oman Air - flight from Heathrow to Muscat and back on time, baggage allowance good, food was ok although on the way back my sandwich was filled with lettuce that had gone off and crew swopped it for a new one. Cabin looks a bit tired. However on the return flight a passenger ahead of us constantly abused other passengers sitting in front of and behind him, shouting, swearing, threatening etc. The cabin crew did nothing about this and pretended it wasn't happening. They also continued to serve him alcohol. 20 minutes out of Heathrow (after an almost 8 hour flight) one man finally made a formal complaint to the crew - who then suddenly took an interest. They called security and had him escorted off the plane. However, I cannot believe they let this go on for the entire flight.

### "ground services are appalling"
Muscat to Kuala Lumpur. Oman Air ground services are appalling. Asked to line up for check-in to KL and then when got to counter was told flight was delayed indefinitely. We go to the information counter and it was mayhem. None of the ground staff knew what to do. Waited for 3 hours before being told that pax will be put up at a hotel. We had enough and decided to forgo the hotel. We were told that they would call us to inform us of our flight but never heard from them. Had to call myself when I heard nothing for 8 hours. In the end, flight was delayed for 12 hours and we missed our code share connecting flight. When we got to KL, it took another 4 hours to organise connecting flight and transit hotel. At least the staff at KLIA was trying hard to be helpful. The flight itself was ok. The main meal was served first this time. Cabin crew was better on this return trip. Per my previous review, legroom was good and IFE had sufficient choices. If Oman Air wants to be world class, its ground staff must be properly trained to manage and deal with unexpected events. There needs to be some established contingency plans/procedures for delayed flights, which inevitably happens.

### "check-in fast and efficient "
Flew in Business on Oman Air from Muscat to Munich, returning from Paris CDG in late December. Both legs were pleasantly uneventful. I always sleep well on the Oman Air business class seats and I did so again on the two night flights. Check-in was fast and efficient in Muscat (separate Business Terminal) and Paris, and the lounges were nice. Food and drink offerings in Paris were clearly better and much more diverse than in Muscat. Oman Air lounge in Muscat is a bit too strongly biased on sandwiches and heavy gravy dishes for my taste. Food on board was good, and the service was friendly. Both flights started and landed on time. Only deduction from my side is for the IFE: although there is a huge list of films available, most are old and – well – not of international quality.

### "good service onboard"
Milano to Bangkok via Muscat with Oman Air, due to the very low price. A very good service onboard with a lot of good meals and snacks. Everyone from the staff was very kind. The flight was on time and the transfer perfect. A lot of inflight entertainments.

### "probably last flight"
My first and probably last flight experience with Oman Air was our holiday flight to Sri Lanka from Frankfurt to Colombo return via Muscat. We booked Oman Air, because of the low price and in comparison to Doha and Abu Dhabi smaller airport, expecting transfer clearance going quicker. The airplane impression was so far ok, entertainment was very poor, the choice of available movies was more a collection of older movies than recent ones. The service quality of staff was poor onboard the flight. After serving the meals the trash was left for another hour and a half in front of the passengers. On the return flight I forgot my Kindle in the seat pocket and informed the cabin staff on our connection flight directly during boarding about it. They told me to get in touch with ground staff and either deliver before departure or get in touch with me after returning. Now, being back since 3 weeks no-one contacted me. Obviously it was my mistake but just as a matter of caring about the customer needs I would have appreciated a formal message, at least that the device was not found. The way of treatment was coherent with the treatment of the staff onboard. Oman Air missed the chance to get me as a new loyal customer.

### "surpassed our expectations"
Travelled to Muscat from Heathrow business class, and the Oman Air experience far surpassed our expectations. The car transfer, airport concierge service at Heathrow and cabin experience were all excellent. My husband felt unwell on the outward flight and the cabin staff could not have been more helpful. They were very gracious and attended to our every need on the outward and return flights. The return trip through Oman airport could have been better in terms of fast tracking business customers once we left the lounge; although this may not have been Oman Airs fault it does need to be improved, and it was not as good as the LHR experience which was seamless. Some of the IFE choices were a little "quaint" but generally fine. We would definitely travel with Oman Air again when we visit our regular hotel in Oman.

### "need to brush up service"
Kuala Lumpur to Muscat, and the flight was on time but Oman Air needs to beef up its service to match the other gulf airlines. Good legroom, the IFE is fine with sufficient choices, the food quality is good and the cabin was clean. The main meal was only served 5 hours into a 7 hour flight. Some passengers were hungry and had to ask for some food. Cabin crew disappeared after serving a muffin and bottle of water at the start of the flight and had to call twice before being able to get a bottle of water. I flew Malaysia Airlines on a connecting flight from Australia and their service was much better. Oman Air's hardware is fine but they really need to brush up on service. Will be interesting to see if my return flight is better.

### "would not readily recommend"
London to Colombo via Muscat, and I though I would give Oman Air a go. It was a big mistake. The London to Muscat flight was 30 mins delayed, and then the Muscat to Colombo flight was delayed by 5 hours - which ruined a wonderful birthday gathering I should have attended. I was issued a voucher to get breakfast at Muscat, there was no apology. The attidude lacked any any care, saying this happens all the time and you just have to wait till the flight departs. I would not readily recommend this airline.

### "cabin does not feel overcrowded"
Flying Kuala Lumpur - Frankfurt via Muscat with Oman Air. Entertainment system did not work on several seats and several re-start attempts did not help. Seats are flat and width of seats is good, but I find them a bit uncomfortable to sleep in. Due to the arrangements of 1-2-1 the cabin does not feel overcrowded. Cabin in general shows already signs of wear. Selection of movies could be better. Food is ok. Ground handling in Muscat is not very well organized - only one queue for economy and business for boarding. Announcement regarding flight status were non-existent. Lounge in Muscat is nice and not too many people there on a Saturday morning. Food selection good. Liked the seats in the 787. Managed even to sleep a little bit in them. However, the entertainment system failed a few times when we experienced slight turbulences - according to the cabin crew - teething problems. Had to rebook my return flight. Called the Muscat Call Center and the women handling my rebooking was not up to her task. She wanted to charge me the rebooking fee for bookings originating in Europe instead of the rebooking fees stated in my flight condition for Malaysia. Calling the Kuala Lumpur office solved the issue. Overall the flight was pleasant and I would fly them again, especially in the 787.

### "never again with Oman Air"
Colombo to Munich via Muscat with Oman Air. Colombo to Muscat on an old plane with tired staff, we landed at Muscat Airport for the first connection flight of two. Now all the passengers are stuck in the transfer hall because Oman Air has overbooked (heavily) - most of the passengers booked their tickets more than 6 months ago! Really bad handling by this unprofessional company. Everybody misses their other connection flight, lots of us will be missing first day of work, never again will we be flying with Oman Air.

### "a poor flight"
Muscat to London Heathrow on Oman Air. Over an hour delay leaving from Muscat. The food was poor, seated in row 25 and only fish or vegetarian left. Few drinks were offered - half a small cup of tea and no refill. The headsets were collected 40 minutes before landing. There was little engagement with the cabin crew. Toilets not too good. The seat was clearly old and uncomfortable. Luggage slow coming out at Heathrow. All in all, a poor flight.

### "cabin crew charmless"
This was my 3rd time flying with Oman Air on the London to Muscat route. The return flight over the Christmas period was very expensive so I was even more irritated by the poor service by that I experienced on previous flights. The cabin crew were charmless and absent for most of the flight. No drinks offered before dinner served. No alcoholic drinks were offered with dinner but I was given one when I asked for it. Breakfast was an awful muffin in a cardboard box and no offer of a hot drink. The passenger next to me asked for a coffee. The stewardess said she would come back to him but did not. Earphones were collected 30 minutes before landing, clearly for the convenience of the staff but not for the passengers. I reported a toilet in a disgusting state but nothing was done about it.

### "could do much better"
Oman Air Business Class from Muscat is a very pleasant experience. The separate check-in area and lounge are excellent, although customer service in the lounge was nowhere near as good as the last time I flew. The seats are still outstanding in business class, but they are starting to look a little tired. The food was not as good as expected (I recently flew Business with Malaysia Airlines and they were considerably better in this department), but staff onboard were excellent and attentive. I had yet another plesant flight with Oman Air. They could do much better in a number of areas, but the last time I suggested this their customer service department were unconcerned about the thoughts I had to offer. The attention to detail for Business Class customers is definitely lacking. I'm still a supporter of Oman Air and hope they can prove my doubts wrong on my next flight. WiFi / internet is a paid service and I think this is unacceptable for business class customers.

### "very disappointed"
This is by far the worst experience for cuatomer support we experienced. Oman Air changed our flight which we bought as a direct flight to a flight with a stopover so the trip ended up taking 3 times the time planned. We did only got to know about it by getting new e tickets send and no exclusion or anything. We of course tried to complain and cancelled the tickets as we could get tickets with other airlines much cheaper if we was willing to do a stopover. We had planned the trip to arrive at dinner time as that is perfect for the kids now we ended up arriving in the middle of the night without dinner for the kids. Every time we tried to talk to them they just send us on to another person and no one was willing to help. We will never recommend this airline to anyone. We are very disappointed.

### "business class magnificent"
Singapore to Muscat via Kuala Lumpur. Oman Air business class seats are magnificent and if you are on the window you have 2 huge storage spaces (like the top deck of 747's, but bigger) to leave your possessions. The food is great, wines as you would expect and the service was genteel. There is a friendliness here (just like in Oman in general) but it is understated and a little shy, which reflects the way Omani's seem to like to do things. Understated but top quality. I have read some negative reports about cabin crew previously not being around, but I think that is this understated way of doing things being misinterpreted as lack of interest. The TV screen was great. The only slight weakness was the amount of choice of Movies. A few more would be nice. But for me the comfort of the seats, quality of food and drink and the helpfulness of staff outweigh the smaller issue of the movie choices. They also have some amazing deals if you watch their website closely.

### "would like to congratulate ground staff"
Oman Air, FRA-MCT on WY114, November 4th. Check-in at FRA Terminal 2 was delayed for more than one hour due to break-down of the computer system. Flight should have been operated by 787-8 aircraft but was actually on A330 with an unscheduled stopover in Milan for "operational reasons". Arrival in MCT with only minutes to spare to board onward flight WY815 to BKK which was kept on hold for connecting passengers and their luggage. Arrival at final destination with only 25 mins delay. I would like to congratulate ground staff at MCT airport for their efficiency and their ability to cope with stressed and often rude passengers.

### "crew reasonably efficient and courteous"
BKK to MCT morning departure with Oman Air. Aircraft not quite full. Multinational crew reasonably efficient and courteous. MCT to FRA on new 787-8: very disappointing experience altogether. Seats narrower than on the A-330 and seat-pitch reduced by 2". Very spacious cabin interior but I didnt' feel any improvement concerning cabin pressure and humidity compared to the "older" airbus. Mood lighting and electronic window shades are only gadgets of no real significance. Cabin crew unpleasant, service rushed with no drink offering with the main meal. Oman Air should pay more attention to cabin crew training as it has always been its weak point.

### "never use them again"
The worst costumer service we have experienced. We booked Oman Air tickets for the entire family direct from Doha to Muscat in August 2015 for trip in Dec 2015. 2 weeks before we are going we receive new etickets without any single comment about any changes. Lucky we checked them, it now turned out that we have stopover in Bahrain on both ways. We paid extra to go with Oman Air to get a direct trip compared to others as we did not want a stop over with two small kids for a short trip like this. We have since tried to contract all Oman Air callcenters and not a single one care or want to try to help. We cannot get our money back, we cannot get a discount for the worse flight and we do not even get a sorry for the inconvenience. We will never use them again or recommend them to anyone else.

### "has more leg room"
I flew Oman Air last January from Kuwait to Muscat and found the aircraft old with no entertainment inside. The aircraft is now new and equipped with inflight entertainment. Seating has more leg room and the food got better. For short flights, they now offer sandwiches which I prefer compared to the mutton and rice or other Indian foods out there. I wish that most of their aircraft has wifi connectivity though I read in the leaflet that they have aircrafts now equipped with wifi. The crew are very friendly and accommodating. If you are flying from Muscat to any part of GCC, watch out for their promotion as it comes very cheap. Instead of flying budget airlines, Oman Air can be much better.

### "bit like a budget carrier"
I flew Oman Air from Doha to Hyderabad via Muscat, returning from Delhi to Doha via Muscat. Ground service in Doha there was chaos at check-in, staff seemed disinterested and standing around without offering any help (advise web check-in). In Muscat crowded boarding gates, staff unable to manage the queues and at times downright rude, Delhi ground service was good. Aircraft were old, reduced leg space especially in Muscat to Doha sector (I'm only 5/8). Any flight beyond an hour can become very uncomfortable. Cabin attendants were not interested in assisting passengers. Basic inflight entertainment system (only audio) or share a screen amongst 3-4 rows. Muscat to Doha sector there was proper Inflight Entertainment system, but they did not provide the headsets. Inflight meal was good but quantity was small (I had pre-ordered seafood meals). Water was provided in small sealed cups, which provided only enough for a few sips and as the plastic cup was too thin, it kept spilling over my clothes. So I had to keep calling the cabin crew for water and finally gave up. Expect only one non-alcoholic/ alcoholic drink. Schedule was good time in all sectors. Experience is a bit like flying a budget carrier with inflight meal options.

### "A330 with lie-flat seats"
Kuala Lumpur-Singapore (a 60 min flight) on A330 with lie-flat seats, configured 1-2-1. Window seats have a lot of storage space. At Kuala Lumpur you get access to Malaysia Airlines lounge. Upon boarding, cabin was very hot, cooled down only a bit during flight, but not much. Seating seems to be free-for-all within same cabin class. My wife's allocated seat was taken by someone else who already settled in. This resulted in her having to wander about the cabin till she on herself picked another random seat. Welcome drink was water. Snacks (some dry mini cakes) provided but no choice of drinks. Orange juice was offered. Male steward was unfriendly. Other cabin crew did not interact with me or my family. Seat showing signs of age, even though this was supposed to be a new plane. Overhead storage limited as there’s none above middle row seats. When leaving the airplane, there was no “thank you for flying with us” or a smile. On arrival to Singapore the plane was parked off-ramp and passengers bussed to terminal. Business class and economy take same bus.

### "a very pleasant surprise"
First time on Oman Air and a very pleasant surprise. Both check-in staff and cabin crew were really friendly and eager to help (although the Muscat airport check-in process is a little chaotic due to the ageing airport). Seat was very comfortable - seemed to have bigger pitch and greater leg room than most carriers. Flights left on time and were very smooth. Catering was nothing special, but drinks were regularly supplied. In-flight entertainment selection good. Extremely good value for money overall, and I would definitely fly with them again.

### "polite and attentive service"
Impressed with Oman Air in all respects. Punctual, fairly new well maintained aircraft with excellent entertainment options, polite and attentive service (although the service from LHR to MCT was admittedly slightly superior but that is more than likely just pot luck) and more edible than usual economy food. The check in process was quick with no queues, although we did arrive to check in around 2 and a half hours before take off. Best of all: the price was substantially less than the bigger carriers and as previously mentioned, connection time at Muscat was perfect at just over an hour. All in all a very good first impression of this airline.

### "seat is comfortable"
Paris to Muscat return with Oman Air, and it is a very good airline. The seat is comfortable, the cabin was beautiful, and the cabin crew are lovely. However the food was bad on the flight out from Paris to Muscat.

### "service by crew was excellent"
London to Manila via Muscat with Oman Air. The flight London to Muscat was good, good leg room, good selection on the in flight entertainment, and service by crew was excellent. Flight was punctual and a connection time of less than 2 hours was great. The second leg from Muscat to Manila was okay, the aircraft appeared older and much less leg room, so felt cramped. Entertainment system again excellent, and service great. I have noticed that many airlines seem to use the older aircraft on the Philippines routes, but was bearable even on a 9hour flight.

### Oman Air customer review
Excellent airline. Very efficient check-in - couldn't have been nicer. Swift boarding. Plenty of leg room and inflight entertainment. Refreshments were plentiful and food was yummy. Cabin staff and pilots were brilliant. Will fly with them again.

### Oman Air customer review
Traveled DXB-MCT-LHR-MCT. I missed the first flight from DXB to MCT and was told that no seats were available on the next flight and therefore would not be able to fly MCT-LHR. The ground staff were extremely helpful and managed to get me on the next flight. MCT-LHR: The IFE was rich in content and the food delicious. The flight attendants were helpful. The aircraft and seats were comfortable. LHR-MCT was even better. Impressed with the ground crew at the check-in. My child was not feeling well and was crying very loudly, the 2 ladies did everything they could to help.

### Oman Air customer review
Frankfurt to Bangkok via Muscat and vice versa. Travelling as a family: 2 adults and 2 children. Excellent service on all legs of both trips. From check in to baggage claim I could not say one negative thing about this airline. They simply deliver: bring you to from A to B at a reasonable price, offering more legspace in economy than their competitors. Service level nothing to be ashamed of, flight attendants cater to all your needs and the food was good. In my opinion one of the most underrated airlines.

### Oman Air customer review
This was the first time since 2013 I'd used Oman Air and I would echo what some other reviews have said in that their onboard quality has begun to deteriorate and is showing signs of budget cuts. As always though the ground staff are excellent in London and Bangkok, check in staff are always friendly, welcoming and good to have a small conversation with. I used their online check in which is vastly improved since 2013 but at check in whilst chatting to staff I was moved to exit row seats due to my height which was very nice of them. On board the seat layout is still welcome as the extra space compared to competitors is felt after a few hours in the air. Even the exit row seats feel spacious in width with the wider fixed armrests. The little extras like menus, hot towels, and amenity kits no longer exist. Not major losses but noticeable. Meal portion sizes seem reduced too but the food quality and taste still seems better than competitors. On board staff are polite and professional, not quite as cheery or conversational as some other airlines but certainly everything you need on board. Muscat airport is starting to feel the weight of increased passenger numbers, I still like this old quiet airport but it felt very full this time and the transfer via bus to and from the terminal building is tiresome. There were problems with processing all the boarding passes for my flight and everyone was issued a new one with a new seat which made for an hour long queue to enter the boarding gate and a bit of a hectic mess on board with people wanting to move. For the price during summer and winter I think Oman Air is very hard to beat on this route. I look forward to using them again next year once the new muscat airport opens.

### Oman Air customer review
I had a mixed opinion of Oman Air. On the first flight to Muscat from London, staff were quite miserable and didn't seem happy to help (unlike budget airlines I've used in Europe, anyway). Dinner was great, but breakfast wasn't great. The layout of the plane was quite good, and entertainment was good. On the returning flight home, staff were friendlier. I don't know if this is a cultural thing, but I just didn't find the staff very helpful or smiley, which is odd, as there is such a huge emphasis on friendliness for airline staff. Perhaps they were just having a bad day, which I understand. For the price of a return flight to Zanzibar from London flying directly to Zanzibar after a quick transfer in Oman, I would travel with Oman Air again. On a superficial note I thought the airline outfit for the staff was beautiful, very smart and the staff looked amazing!

### Oman Air customer review
Extremely pleased with the service, flexible food. I guess because it is not a preferred flight in comparison with Emirates, I got the whole row by the window all by myself. And I like the sitting arrangement of 2-4-2. Nice for couple, wide enough for family. Announcement of breaking fast, hijab cartoon for safety video, all halal food perfect for muslim and flexible for others. And since I am Malaysian, quite happy that they have a "malay" movie section on board.

### Oman Air customer review
Traveled from Paris CDG to New Delhi and New Delhi to Paris CDG via Muscat. Airline is good in terms of seat comfort, cabin staff service, food, inflight entertainment but Oman Air is not reliable in terms of timing. Flight from Muscat to New Delhi was delayed by 6 hours, even when I kept a margin of 4 hours I missed my connecting flight from New Delhi and again flight from New Delhi to Muscat was delayed by 3 hours on top of its flight from Muscat to Paris CDG was delayed by 1 hour and again I missed my train from Paris. It was my first and last trip with Oman Air

### Oman Air customer review
I was very pleased with the service provided. We paid £420 return which was a bargain. Nice new planes, big individual TV's, good food, plenty of drinks and good seat pitch. The layout of 2x4x2 is good if you are a couple and can get the window seats. Oman airport is not the best but it was a short stop so didn't really matter to us. My only gripes are the toilets were not the cleanest and one or two of flight attendants let the service down, but overall I thought it was great value for money and would definitely fly with them again.

### Oman Air customer review
4-5 May 2015. WY0815. ZRH-MCT. Old business class in 1-2-1 layout great seat as always. MCT-BKK - new business class in 2-2-2 layout which is claustrophobic. Been a gold member on sinbad for many years but with this Air Berlin-style business class I'd rather fly economy for a fraction of the price or change to other carriers.

### Oman Air customer review
We travelled from LHR to Kathmandu on April 23rd 2015 having chosen Oman Air because of the price and seat pitch. We were very happy with the planes the food and the cabin crew. The only small complaint was that there was insufficient liquids offered on the flight between Muscat and Kathmandu. Following the earthquake in Nepal on 25th April we felt it best to return early. Oman changed our flight without a fuss. I was not expecting a full meal on the flight out of Kathmandu because of the situation there and so was surprised to find an excellent meal supplied drinks freely available and exceptional service from the crew. The second leg of the flight was also good and again the cabin crew were friendly and helpful. I will certainly consider using Oman Air in the future.

### Oman Air customer review
MCT-DOH return in economy late April 2015. Both flights uneventful short 1hr Gulf hops. Still pleasant. Seats reasonably pitched staff friendly. All on time all comfortable. Except for the food which consisted of inedible sandwiches. Eat before you board.

### Oman Air customer review
Have flown Oman Air in Business class twice in the past month to London MCT-LHR-MCT. Flew on 19th March and again on 9th April. The overall comfort of the cabin is great with a very comfortable seat and amenities. The greatest disappointment is the lavatories. For some reason they are filthy and lack proper cleaning. For instance the soap dispenser since my first trip was so dirty that soap has oozed out around the nozzle and remained the same when I flew the same flight two weeks later. The food quality has dropped and is not how it was the year before. The entertainment package onboard needs to be improved and additional options such as movies to be added. No change with inflight entertainment between March and April. Only reason why I pick Oman Air to fly to London is because it is the only direct non-stop flight to London.

### Oman Air customer review
LHR-MCT-LHR 14 & 22 March in Economy. Normally fly PE or WT Plus but no direct flights with PE / WT Plus except BA which stopped at Abu Dhabi en route. Did not want the extra travelling time so picked Oman Air for the 34 inch seat pitch in Economy. Was apprehensive when we saw how many kids there were and also the scrum that developed when boarding started (why does everyone have to get up and crowd the entrance when their seat numbers haven't been called?). But actually a very pleasant experience on board: as 2-4-2 format had pre-booked window and aisle seats - plenty of legroom and very comfortable with pillows and blankets in each seat. Excellent IFE - modern THALES system - but perhaps a better choice of films could be provided. Take your own headphones - mine worked fine once I figured out how to position the jack in the rather odd socket. Decent service with pre meal beer and individual bottle of wine with the absolutely outstanding meal (especially for economy) on outbound flight - not quite so good on return. Would use again without hesitation (but I'd like to try the sumptuous looking Business Class).

### Oman Air customer review
Flew MUC-MCT-COK and back. Like the little boy with the curl when they're good they're very good but when things go wrong. On this trip we had a 9-hour delay in Muscat provoked by computer failure in the terminal but exacerbated by incompetent and lazy staff. In total we had three sets of crew the first two wanting only to complete their shift and get away. No food. No drink. Very angry passengers and the police involved. We sat on the plane from 12.30 at night until 5am without anything happening. Then a trip to the terminal (again no food no drink) then back on the plane then off again. By then it was 9am and somebody senior had taken matters in hand. All hold luggage removed passengers asked to claim their luggage then back on the plane again. The final crew were excellent but it only showed up how poor the previous lot were.

### Oman Air customer review
MCT-CDG one way. First time I fly WY in Y class. Good experience. The seat was truly excellent with comfortable cushion and very clever recline system. Pitch seemed good – I had exit seat. IFE was very impressive: the biggest screen I have seen in Y and fantastic interface even better than QR IFE. However the choice of films was very limited. Food was average but we had enough. FAs were cold and not smiley but my neighbours and I got quickly everything extra we had asked. I would fly WY again.

### Oman Air customer review
LHR-MCT-TRV and return. The flight down was impressive. Plenty of legroom and friendly staff. In fact the staff were full of smiles and very efficient. The food was good and the Inflight Entertainment very good. I felt the Airbus was a bit old and clunky with a roaring take off so the airline will need to invest in more modern aircraft. Muscat Airport is somewhat basic in areas but there is brand new spanking Terminal which will open soon. The second flight to Trivandrum was also good and we were served a delicious Indian fish curry. The return flight from Muscat to London was a different story. The food was atrocious. Tough Beef and the other choice was pasta and only pasta in a tomato sauce. That said the breakfast warm egg wrap was better. On all flights the toilets were very clean and smelt of detergent. The economy seats are comfortable and much more so that those on Air India's Dreamliner. All in all a good airline. But they need to consider the catering at Muscat for onward journeys.

### Oman Air customer review
LHR to BKK via Muscat return. Chose this airline because of the legroom in economy. The airlines makes a lot of their reputation for service but in reality the staff are the worst element of all four trips. None of the flight attendants smiled or were in any way proficient with the extra service required to deserve the accolades the airline talks about. Our flight attendant got "stroppy" when I asked if I could have a glass of wine with my meal. The toilets on the flight were also quite dirty throughout all four trips.

### Oman Air customer review
ZRH-MCT-BLR and back. Long haul (ZRH-MCT-ZRH) is very good. Excellent 1-2-1 Layout with very comfortable flat bed. Catering and service very good. Short haul (MCT-BLR-MCT) is patchy. Attendants not focussed. Hub airport MCT very compact (which is good!) but no aerobridge (bus/stairs inconvenient for aged and less agile. Biz lounge somewhat limited: very slow WiFi almost no biz mags/ newspapers. New airport delayed. Optimistic for Oman and very likely to fly with them again.

### Oman Air customer review
LON-CMB-LON trip. First time flyer on Oman air. Primary selection of the airline was time convenience due to work and was competitively priced. LON-Muscat both legs was an ageing A330 which badly needs cosmetic improvement for the interior. Staff needs to be re-trained to improve courtesy and attitude and to exercise their facial muscles to improve their non existent smile. The on-board meal was surely from "weight watchers" programme as I had lost some weight due to unpalatable and non-appetising food. Muscat-CMB sector was on Boeing 737 with the only difference being a new and bright interior. Good comfortable seat and leg room did improve body comfort which was hindered by gastric dumping of the food. There was not much difference in the price in relation to two other reputed Middle Eastern carriers which I have flown before (always had very good experience with). Overall Oman Air will be worthy competitor with other low budget airlines but needs resuscitation of imagination courtesy and culinary skills to compete with other established and emerging airlines. I would avoid this airline in future unless there is significant improvement.

### Oman Air customer review
Fifth trip with Oman this year. As I noted previously there has been a decline in service but not so bad as we wouldn't fly with them again. Airline food is never great and these flights were no different. The Muscat to Heathrow leg was almost 9 hours thanks to a head wind...it felt like forever. Attendants good and proactive with the cleaning of toilets. Will still fly Oman while they are much cheaper than competitors.

### Oman Air customer review
I used to be an Oman Air fan. New planes great business class seats in long haul and an excellent service but have now recently flown with them and had very disappointing service and flight experience. Flying to and from Muscat to Salalah they keep changing the departure times 3 times and although they sort of inform you it is almost impossible to understand whether it has really changed or not. This of course means ones onward flights are compromised. Even our friends in Muscat say now they will only fly Oman Air as a last resort. What a pity many of the ingredients are there to make it an excellent airline but it just seems to be going downhill. I also hear they are reconfiguring the business class seat layout to 2x2x2 its now 1x2x1. Prices are also high compared to other middle east airlines. Please Oman Air go back to what you were.

### Oman Air customer review
Flew recently from Munich to Muscat and back. In-flight entertainment system faulty on both flights but worse from Muscat/Munich flight. No sound on one seat no flight map or news programme available on both seats. On-board service staff were not interested in passengers. Food was terrible especially on the Muscat/Munich flight. No coffee offered on Muscat/Munich flight and when I asked for it I received instant coffee with milk powder. Oman Air website did not work on the day of Muscat/Munich flight so no online check-in was possible. When we called the airline's office in Muscat a very unhelpful man told us that he couldn't tell us which seats were reserved for us and that he couldn't help us. Considering what we paid for our seats airline offers poor value for money.

### Oman Air customer review
Start with the good points - good price good leg room and good inflight entertainment - but very average food and cabin staff. However take note: toilets were dreadful on all 4 airplanes we flew on. The staff just stood around didn't bother to check on them at all. I did ask a hostess to clean them on the first flight but then decided not to risk a visit because of what I had seen. It was not just a one off as conditions were the same on the 2 flights out and the 2 flights back 2 weeks later. I think it is just poor staff training.

### Oman Air customer review
CDG-MCT-BKK and return several times per year on Oman Air. Flight experience varies from fair to very good depending on the attitude of the flight attendants. Quality of food has gone down slightly in the last few months (no more menu cards and crew does not know precisely what they serve ). Transit in MCT smooth and efficient in spite of the bus transfer. Will continue to fly Oman Air because of the generous seat pitch and the benefits of their Sindbad frequent flyers programme.

### Oman Air customer review
Travelled 1st April to LHR to BKK via Muscat. Flown with this airline 4 different times and my experience has been great on each trip. Inflight entertainment is adequate but could be better. Can charge phones on board as I found a plug socket between the seats. Food was good and kept you going. Stop over was short. Yes I know sometimes it can be a long stop over depending what days you want to fly out and experienced the first time spending 12 hours at Seeb was dragging and not a lot to do but I have booked flights with minimum of 2 hours stop over on each flight which makes it bearable. Easy to get to flight connections when transferring from flights to departure lounge. Yes Seeb is an old airport and new one is due to open sometime soon - hopefully. Had a great price ticket too under £435.

### Oman Air customer review
LHR to BKK. This was our third trip on Oman Air this year. There has been a decline in service of late in this airline. The food choices ran out before 1/4 of the plane had been served. The plane was old and not the cleanest around. Having said that the flight was almost half the price of the next cheapest flight so what we saved was our spending money. We have booked again hopefully the service will be back to what we expect.

### Oman Air customer review
Me and my family flew from London to Colombo. On 31st August we came back to London on flight WY 372 WY 101. Colombo to Oman flight - we requested a blanket they told us that they could not provide blankets for economy class. After a long conversation with the stewardess we managed to get blankets. From Oman to London (WY 101) the flight was delayed 45 minutes before takeoff we were onboard the flight for one hour without air-conditioning. When they started serving drinks I asked for a drink which should have been served with a slice of lemon it wasn't and I was told they had none. Then they gave us a menu card there were 3 choices (chicken beef or vegetarian) but when they started serving there was only one option which was the vegetarian menu. These kind of things never happened to me with other airlines I think I made a mistake choosing this airline.

London Heathrow to Muscat to Bangkok return. Chose the airline because competitively priced (cheap). Left on time and seats had plenty of leg room. Arrival in Muscat and quick transfer through to connecting flight. Flight arrived at Bangkok but due to bad weather diverted to Don Muang for refuelling and the 10 min flight back to original airport. Plane was full of fairly unruly passengers connecting to the sub-continent with plenty of ill disciplined children. Each leg of the flight had run out of our choice and we were left with only the veggie option. Mostly cabin crew uninterested apart from the Thai ones who were courteous attentive. On the return journey flight was 45 minutes late into LHR because one of the mewling brats was taken ill and bags needed to be unloaded. The cooling system in the cabin had malfunctioned on the return and we had 7 sweltering hours flying back. We also had a 13 hour transfer in Muscat. Good inflight entertainment system with latest release.

DXB-BKK return J class outbound to BKK via MCT early departure flight on time shared lounge with Gulf air - great lounge food and staff. Flight short with a OJ or water hardly Biz class. Lounge in MCT good as usual. MCT- BKK. As usual great seats though showing their age food good wines ok cheap champagne Entertainment just ok. Arrival easy with fast track immigration. Return flight delayed 2 hours lounge ok nothing to eat as such staff very polite food ok on return same menu and wines etc same. Staff looked bored especially the male staff who went through the motions got orders wrong. Made up time on return to meet connecting flight and ran to gate to be shouted at by staff not our fault your flights are delayed so don't shout at us for being late. Flight on time to Dubai food and one drink. Staff again looked bored. Bags made it even though only 20 minutes between flights impressive. Overall good hardwear and extras but Cabin staff need to actually look like they like their jobs. No smiles and bored rigid but polite.

LHR to BKK via Muscat - All flights on time and a short layover in Muscat food wasn't that great on the way out but return leg was nice. This is the first time I have used Oman I usually use Etihad or Emirates but I probably wont chose Oman again until they open the new airport in Muscat. The reason been there are no airbridges to get on and off the plane they use busses. This makes boarding a lot longer sat in a waiting area with no toilets or any facilities Also as the plane is at a remote stand there is no air conditioning until take off and with 300 passengers sat waiting at 45C it is unbearable making it very uncomfortable. 3 times I had to ask for a coffee the service was a hit and miss too. I expected more from Oman and they need to do a little work to compete with other middle east airlines.

I recently flew on frequent flyer points from Bangkok - Muscat. Oman Air is sadly loosing its boutique style. Upon check-in at the business class counter I waited for over 30 minutes while the check-in staff checked economy class passengers in and had them dispute all their luggage. A complete joke and not a single apology by the staff as I stood waiting. The Oman Air lounge is nice but sadly people laying everywhere on the floor and dirty plates. It seemed the staff were intimidated by the passengers. Onboard I felt I was not a guest or passenger but a nuisance. Oman Air use to be amazing. The food service but now the complete opposite. The toilets seemed to not be cleaned once during the flight and then Muscat Airport. They are building a new airport but this would have to be one of the worst in the Gulf. Sadly Oman Air has gone from been my choice of airline to no more.

Milan Malpensa (MXP) to Bangkok (BKK). At check in we received invitation cards for business class lounge in Milan and Muscat. When the formalities were done staff accompanied us to the business class lounge guiding us through speedlanes for passport control and safety check. A330 business class layout is 1-2-1 so every seat has direct access to the aisles. All seats can be adjusted to a flat bed with seat pitch of 82 inch. Very comfortable. The staff welcomed us in a very friendly way and service during the flight was amazing. Perfect food and very good service. We had to transfer in Muscat and had a pleasant time for 2 hours in the business class lounge in Muscat. Muscat to Bangkok was just as good as the first flight- excellent food and staff. Before landing we received a card for the speedlane which helped us through passport control in no time. We flew back from Bangkok - Mucat - Milan on 21th april and we enjoyed the flight just as much as the previous flights.

10 May MCT-DXB. 11 May DXB-MCT. Both flights full awful experience. Old planes but crew were helpful. MCT-DXB: Checking agent changed my seat without asking me from a pre-booked rear window seat to a middle seat on the wing. Flight delayed 30 minutes on a 40 minute flight! Very disappointing. DXB-MCT: Same as above with extra 20 minutes to offload the passengers as they provided one stairs to over 250 passengers as we flew back on A330-200.

I travel a lot and I cannot praise Oman Air enough. Staff will do anything to serve your requests such as extra pillows extra amenity kits etc. Meals are excellent and staff are so happy even when you ask them for your 5th drink. On our flight any extra meals were given to the passengers which was very nice. TV's are very large and offer all the latest films. Seat pitch is very large and seats are comfy. Even on our connecting flight from Muscat to DXB we were given a meal and drinks on the short 1 and a bit hour flight.

Muscat to Amman Jordan on WY 413 on 14 April 2014. The flight was full and the seats were cramped and uncomfortable. The service on-board was acceptable. Used the toilets a few times and they were unclean and smelt like a toilet with unknown liquid on the floor. Will avoid flying Oman Air unless there are no other options.

### Oman Air customer review
London to Muscat on flight WY 102 on 17th April and Muscat to Hyderabad on flight WY 231 on 18th April 2014. Onboard the Muscat to Hyderabad flight the crew were indifferent to passengers. Being in a service industry the basic minimum is a smile on their face which was missing. They were looking at all passengers as if they were not welcome. During the serving of lunch the tone was terse and not at all friendly. For almost an hour there were long queues outside the so called "economy" toilet and staff did not allow passengers to use "business class" toilet. Food was pretty ordinary. I do not think I will travel Oman Air again.

Our third trip with Oman Air and would not hesitate to use them again. We flew London-Muscat-Bangkok in economy and being Silver Sindbad members enjoyed a very swift check in and complimentary access to lounges in all airports. All flights left on time and had courteous staff. The food was good for airline food and drinks were available on demand. The legroom was good and seats comfortable. The toilets on all four sectors were regularly cleaned and were tidy whenever used. A value for money service giving other airlines a run for their money.

### Oman Air customer review
This is my fourth time flying Paris CDG-Kuala Lumpur return in business class. Service and comfort excellent as good as many airlines' first class. The seat turns into a flat bed and wide enough for a comfortable sleep. Good food very well presented by their very friendly and competent cabin crew. I just have a few points to make that could improve their service. Limousine service should be part of the deal when flying business class dining should be on demand and flights to Kuala Lumpur should give a choice of Malay cuisine. The short connection time in Muscat can be a source of anxiety as passengers need to go through security again and there is no priority lane for business class passengers. The last few times there was hardly any wait at security so that was fine but should there be a delay I hope Oman Air can guarantee that passengers will not miss their connection flight. If you get time to visit their lounge it is usually quiet and comfortable but they need to provide more shower facilities. I've used this facility and has been lucky I did not have to wait but I noticed that there is only one shower room.

### Oman Air customer review
LHR-BKK out 28th Jan return 13th Feb. Second time with Oman Air. First flew with them when the A330 fleet was almost new. Tried them again as the fares were very attractive. Unfortunately some of the wow factor has gone from this service. On the earlier occasion I could not fault the service and comfort with full service and convenience packs. Now the planes are older and have not been touched since new with the cabin fabrics showing signs of hard wear over the last 5-6 years threadbare and stained in places. The footrest (unnecessary) kept flopping down restricting leg space. When you do use it it puts your legs in an unnatural position. Just take them out! The toilets were also shabby. There were so many in flight announcements that watching a film was like commercial TV with adverts. Those were the bad bits. Overall the service is still worth taking as it represents excellent value on this route compared with other Middle East airlines. The leg room is an unrivalled 34" connection times minimal and a 30kg baggage allowance means I can take all my sports equipment with me. The bonus is if you are travelling as a couple or father/son as I did the two seats close to the window really provide a comfort zone in the A330 (2-4-2 as opposed to the 3-4-3 configuration on 777's flown by the other Middle Eastern operators and EVA). All airlines are making cuts but the little extras Oman Air used to have are now gone shame.

I flew for the first time with Oman Air from Heathrow to Bangkok via Muscat and returned 4 weeks later. I was impressed with the efficiency of check in with the punctuality of take off times. The cabin staff were polite the food was adequate and the in-flight entertainment excellent. Toilets were kept clean at all times. I flew economy and I would use again.

We flew from Milan via Muscat to Bangkok and back and were happy. Lounges are all great. Very comfortable business seats much better than Thai. Food interesting with Arab specialities. Nice change. Only negative thing: Service is somehow chaotic. No service in-between meals nobody would take away empty glasses or cups or ask you if you wanted something to drink. Staff should be better trained. Would we fly with them again - yes.

Bangkok to Muscat with final destination Zurich. WY 0818 and 0153. Normally I fly with Swiss Lufthansa or Emirates. I tried this time Oman Air but was really disappointed. The inflight-experience itself in the Business Class was good but all the rest not at all: Chauffeur Service: Apparently this is not included (other carriers include it always). Website: Very slow and not the standard I'm used to with other companies. This is really not what I expect from a Business Class Provider!

### Oman Air customer review
LHR to Colombo via Muscat. Outward flight was very unsatisfactory. Cabin crew were indifferent and at times positively rude. They appeared not to want to do the job at all customers being a annoyance to be tolerated at best. Aircraft was looking "tired" and in need of refurbishment. Carpets worn seat foam lacking support and uncomfortable etc. IFE worked but again looks dated to alternative airlines. Return flight was better with happier crew and better service but not enough to erase my negative memories of the outward flight! I have flown with Oman over several years and feel the service offered is slowly deteriorating to the point where I will not be booking with them again if there is a viable alternative. This is a shame as I like their flight times and Muscat is a far more attractive transit option than the other gulf airports.

Flew economy from Muscat to Heathrow on 20 January. Cabin service was unacceptable. The crew did not service the toilets during the flight. I pointed out to a cabin attendant that the lavatories were in an awful state and why was he not servicing them there were no tissues paper towels and the lavatory paper had nearly run out. Also the floors and seats were in an unacceptable condition. He said that as they were in use all the time so he could not get into them. On our outbound flight LHR to Muscat 10 days earlier the lavatories were not serviced for the second half of the journey.

I flew Oman Air WY 826 in business class from KL to Muscat having come from Australia on Malaysian. They did not have the systems to issue my second boarding pass in Sydney so I had to queue at the transfer desk in KL. This experience was just shocking. A sign says Malaysian are handling agents for Oman Air and others so I joined the queue. Half an hour later I was told no Malaysian does not handle Oman Air and their people would be coming in to work soon. So I joined another queue. About 100 people were making the transfer. I queued for an hour. This was in the middle of a busy area with people cutting through the queue all the time with their luggage. Many Oman Air passengers were not too good about waiting their turn. There is no separate queue for business class. On board the flight was exceptionally comfortable. However it was a day flight and given 90 minutes a queuing after a long flight to KL and hours in the airport it was not worth paying the business class fare. Oman is a nice place to visit and they run a large tourist promotion effort in Australia but they really must fix the transit at KL. It would be best to provide boarding passes at the original point of check-in. With that I could have had 90 minutes more sleep at the KL airside hotel.

Kuwait - Kuala Lumpur (transit in Muscat). Regular business class check-in (at least I didn't have to stand in line to get my boarding pass.) Lounge in Kuwait and Muscat were fine but lounge in KLIA was superb (I was granted the MAS golden lounge which was superior compared to top international lounges such as Bahrain and Dubai lounges.) Flight to/from Kuwait - Muscat was fine onboard their B737 fleet but to/from Muscat - Kuala Lumpur is where the fun begins in their business class cabin. Really superior business class cabin with a decent entertainment system fine food quality good amenity kit and friendly crew. For the price I paid I would say value exceeded cost. Would consider flying again.

Six of us flew from London to Bangkok via Muscat. The cost of the tickets were a couple of hundred pounds cheaper than other airlines. This was our second trip.

We are already looking forward to our next trip in April.

LHR-MCT-MLE - return 2 Nov 13 - Economy. My experiences don't correspond with some on here. LHR check in was fast and efficient. A330 to MCT overnight was more than tolerable. Great seat pitch. A huge selection of films and TV programmes on the IFE and the FAs were efficient and friendly. Food choice was limited and in fact we only had a choice of one. Onward flight to MLE A330 was busy but to same high standard. I found the transfer in MCT fast and efficient. They are obviously building a new airport as you can see it across the apron. Return leg was brilliant - the A330 from MLE to MCT literally had 15-20 passengers! It was effectively empty! Obviously this meant great service and choices. MCT to LHR was very busy but no complaints. My partner and I are both big lads (over 6') and the biggest plus for us was the twin window seats on a A330 and the pitch! I will definitely use again.

We just went to the Maldives with Oman Airways from Frankfurt. Although the first two flights were not even half booked out we could not choose seats on the way to the Maldives. On the way back we explicitly asked to sit in a front row or near an emergency exit and although we were supposed to get them we did not have a seat there on both flights! Some planes are new others already pretty old. All of them are dirty and not well maintained. The lavatories are in a bad shape. The food was poor in taste and on several flights we didn't even have a choice since there was only one meal left. Bad if you were a vegetarian. No alcohol served on the 7 hour flight back to Germany. Entertainment system is actually good however on all flights either the remote the touchscreen or the headset (plug) were broken. Service was not good either. Also the Airport in Muscat is loud and dirty. So unfortunately I cannot recommend Oman Airways.

LHR-BKK via Muscat 15th/16th Dec BKK-LHR via Muscat 27th Dec. Outbound flight was tolerable although service has declined to perfunctory. What happened to the meals? Suvarnabhumi deplaning delayed first by 30 mins as pilot appeared to take wrong exit from main runway. Chaotic scenes as people started unloading luggage lockers while still on apron. No control from crew. 27th flights back were appalling. Muscat transfer was 1hr. Qatar can manage at 45mins. Not Oman. Deplaning delayed for 25 minutes as coaches were found. Chaos ensued with huge tail back at security. Being shouted at for being late by airport staff for Oman's inefficiency is not on. Plane for Muscat Heathrow leg was both shockingly filthy and decrepit. Toilets were disgusting tray tables stained and smothered in food debris. Whole plane smelt. This was a real shock to us we've used Oman regularly for over 5 yrs but these flights mean we're looking elsewhere. With the awful food offering dirty planes and being treated like cattle Oman seems to pitching to be the Gulf version of Ryannair.

LHR-MCT-BKK-MCT-LHR. Have travelled with Oman Air before and yet again it was all first class. The check in very quick and easy and once on board was very well looked after by friendly and competent crew. Plenty of drinks and water given out before lights out. The entertainment system is ok but not up to Emirates standard but all in all a very good economy product.

Flew KL to Muscat on 15th November and loved every minute of it. Their A320 Business Class is better than most other airlines First Class. Crew food and wine and seat without comparison in a total of 12 flights we undertook. We then flew Muscat to Milan and flight equally fabulous. Muscat Lounge perfect with plenty of food and wine offerings and friendliness of staff. Love their business class seating and we were lucky enough to get the single window seating (10A11A & 12A). Absolutely no complaints at all and would recommend Oman Air as an ideal airline for Australia to Europe. Ex Melbourne via Malaysia Airlines which once again could find no fault with. Addressed by name and although only a snack served for an early morning departure was enough for that time and offered numerous other options during flight. A great combination for us.

MUC-MCT-CMB in Economy. Booked ahead and they were not the cheapest so I was expecting an overall pleasant experience based on most reviews here. What we got were new comfortable aircraft with a great pitch but that was about it. Connecting in Muscat is in hordes at a way outdated airport. Service on both flights was ok to downright rude crews who did the minimum only. MUC to MCT disorganised and it took them 2.5 hours for the meal service on a not even 6 hour flight. On to CMB just given a meal with no drink choice at all for the whole cabin except water within 45 minutes and with quite some attitude. I will not use this airline again!

Riyadh to Muscat return. Service to Muscat ok. FA's ok meal acceptable IFE ok just listened to music as the only TV program was showing a Muslim program. I could accept that if I was using Saudi Airlines but not Oman air. Return from Muscat horrendous. FA's ok again IFE was another Muslim show there wasn't any music as an alternative. The main meal was ok but the salad wasn't cold and tasted odd. I had one mouthful and no more. I won't be using Oman Air again.

Zurich - Muscat - Zurich: A330. Superb Oman Air staff on ground. Fast and friendly check-in. Best business class cabin ever experienced. Long flat and broad flat beds. Excellent food with a big range of choice. Lovely wines. Crew ok on both flights. Not quite up to the rest of the product. A pity really. Airport Muscat: Priority bus transfer to terminal. Very friendly security staff. Lounge Oman Air Muscat: Fantastic. Cosy. Great range of food always topped up. Friendly staff. Muscat - Mumbai - Muscat: 737-800 Broad seats not like on European short haul. Good recline. Top notch cabin crew on both flights! Tasty food. Arrival in Mumbai a catastrophe. Business class immigration lane as chaotic as rest. Unfortunately no Oman Air staff to assist. On departure different story: accompanied by Oman Air staff from check-in to lounge and then to plane. That is impressive!

CAI-MCT-DXB. First sector on a 737-800 leased from a Czech company. Seats were fine for the 3.5 hr flight. Crew did their job nothing more. Catering very average but not a major concern. Transit security in MCT took maybe 15 minutes-so tight connections are doable even during peak times. Not much to see at MCT although one of the pluses of MCT (and BAH DOH) is that they're relatively small and you don't have to walk much unlike DXB. MCT-DXB sector was on an E-70 with PTVS. Nice interior and comfortable seats. Both flights were very punctual in fact my flight arrived into DXB twenty minutes ahead of schedule. For a very competitive price I would not mind booking WY again even if it involves backtracking (overall adds just an hour over flying QR or GF). I do feel however that the airline focuses more on the flagship routes to Heathrow KL Indian Ocean etc. when it comes to delivering a 'premium' experience. This is where the airline fails in comparison to all the other competitors. I do like however the fact that I got a very cheap ticket that got me from A to B.

WY 203 - Muscat to Mumbai on 6 October. 737-800 plane - must be one of the older in the fleet. Boarding by bus as standard at MCT until the new airport opens. Flight 50% full so easy to get situated. Plenty of legroom - took off 15 min late and lunch served quickly. Had chicken curry and was delicious and substantial. Watched shared overhead screens with a mix of Bollywood and US shows. Flight attendants friendly. Landed on time and bags out when arrived at the carousel - long walk though as we parked as far from immigration as possible - not Oman Air's fault. Joined their Sindbad FF program also and was easy.

Oman Air WY638 from Abu Dhabi to Muscat - October 4. Flight departs at 4.30am so really early but connects with their huge bank of flights to India. Embraer E175 - about 70% full. 45 minute flight - service was a water and muffin. Inflight entertainment turned on after 15 minutes but as the flight is so short you can't finish a sit- com. Easy landing and bags off quickly. Flight attendants in coach were Russian - one friendly and one so-so. Was satisfied with Oman Air.

CAI-MCT-DXB return in business class. Because I had read such good reviews of Oman Air's business class we decided to do a dog's leg to Dubai instead of taking a direct flight with Egyptair or Emirates. This turned out to be a mistake. On the positive side the Czech cabin crew (this was on a 737-800 wet leased from a Czech company) was cheerful and efficient and the business class lounge in Muscat was as excellent as we had been led to expect. However the flight experience was basically awful. Old armchair seats that had ZERO recline and no footrest; faulty headphones that had to be changed on two occasions an IFE system that consisted of fold-down screens with a choice of an arabic movie with illegible subtitles and the moving map catering that ranged from the adequate - to a "special gluten-free" meal that had enough gluten in it to send me straight to hospital had I chosen to believe an untrained cabin attendant who assured me that the pitta bread buns and cheese sambousek on my tray were indeed gluten-free.

LON-MCT-BKK. By booking early we were able to afford a one way upgrade to business for the same price as premium economy with any other airline. As has been widely stated the business class experience is superb: excellent seat and service.

BKK-MCT-MUC return. Flight to Muscat was about half full so plenty of room to stretch out. Entertainment was fine and watched a new movie and several TV shows. Economy class seating was spacious in a 2x4x2 configuration. Food was average and not much of it but wine was plentiful. Hot wrap snack before arrival into Muscat was just ok. Muscat airport has no jetways so buses are involved. Both sectors took no more than 10 minutes total and was well organized. The airport was fine though the Duty Free seemed overly expensive but there are several decent food outlets including Costa Coffee. Flight to Munich again was half empty so we could stretch out but once again the food was just average though they gave us several bottles of wine and water. Return flight from Munich to Muscat had 42 passengers total on the flight. We were the only ones in the front economy class cabin and were served within 10 minutes after take off and lights out 30 minutes later which was great as the flight leaves at 10pm. Slept 5 hours straight as we made beds from the middle section with many blankets and pillows. Better than first class! Flight from Muscat to Bangkok was 100pct full so I was now wondering what the service would be like. We had 2 seats together at the window in 2nd cabin with no room to stretch out but again the seating is great and the best economy class at 34 inches I've been in. Service was efficient and quick even with a full flight. All sectors the cabin crew were friendly and welcoming. Nice towel service all flights and good amenities kits handed out on each sector. Entertainment is fine and no issues and could recharge my phone and laptop as well from any seat. My only issue was the food. Little of it and not very appetizing though on one sector the vegetarian lasagne was good. Water bottles were also handed out immediately after service on all sectors which is a great idea. If I was not Gold with Etihad I would fly them again though you do get Etihad mileage by flying Oman but just not the bonus miles for Gold or Silver level. Good experience overall!

Sometimes we ended up with no choice with meals had to eat what they offered. No refreshments before the main meal. I requested ear plugs twice but cabin crew did not bother to supply. This was not my first travel with Oman Air. Ground staff in both Oman and Sri Lanka are excellent very helpful and switched on.

Milan to Kuala Lumpur and return via Muscat. Outbound was fine very impressed by the value for money. Entertainment was good but all of us had headset which either didn't work or only worked from one ear. Had to change seats. Main meals were fine snacks pretty poor. Return flight a nightmare. First leg ok. Flight from Muscat delayed 13 hours. I understand it can happen my complaint is about the way ground staff treated us. No explanations lots of excuses. After 6 hours they drove us by bus to a desk (still inside the airport) where we were supposed to receive a temporary visa. We had to deal ourselves with the staff who didn't believe that we were told to leave the airport. Finally after one hour fighting with other passengers who also wanted a hotel room we managed to have that piece of paper and went to the bus to the hotel. The aircraft is nice but I don't recommend this company because if anything goes wrong they can't deal with it.

In June I travelled from Frankfurt via Muscat to Bangkok. The check-in counter closed unusually early so I had more than 1.5 hours free time. The seat load factor was very low so I had enough space. Usually there would have been a 3 meal choice there was only one left for me. A hot snack was served as well being something unidentifiable in a roll with chicken. The IFE had a huge variety to offer but only one side of the headphones worked properly.

Third time flying Paris-Kuala Lumpur via Muscat in business class. Service was excellent and the seats comfortable with a lot of space and privacy. Oman Air's business class cabin offers comfort and space which could rival many airlines' first class cabin. Fare for this trip very competitive. Happy with the service. However all business class passengers should be offered the limousine service as advertised on their website. Secondly while in transit in Muscat passengers should not have to go through another security check and if so there should be a priority lane for premium passengers. The last few trips the security checks were fairly quick as there weren't many passengers but when you have a rather short transit time this can be a source of anxiety. On my return trip via Muscat the plane landed 25-30 minutes late and I was anxious in case I had to go through a long queue in security. However the crew reassured me and as it happens there was no queue. Thirdly for trips to and from Malaysia it would be a good idea to add some Malay cuisine to the menu. Finally dining should be on demand in business class and there should be an option to order from a menu online prior to departure this will avoid disappointment of the crew running out of your choice on the menu. For example on the first leg from Paris they ran out of sea bass on the business class menu.

LHR-MCT-BKK and back. Great service in the Heathrow lounge (even though it's a pay-for-access lounge to the general public as guests of Oman Air we had reserved seating and table service). All flights were on schedule. The cabin of the A330 is superb as many others have said their business class is a product that most other airlines would like to have as their first class offering. Business lounge is Muscat is huge. Great selection of complimentary food and drinks as well as complimentary treatments in the spa. The Oman Air lounge in BKK is small but perfectly formed. Staff Service was generally really good but some crew struggled to understand us - I think it could be improved upon if there were more crew with better English language skills. Will definitely use again.

CDG-MCT-KUL. Price are reasonable. Service excellent. Food is amazing comfort much higher than other airline's business class cabin. Cabin staff not too much presence very discrete with a smile.

### Oman Air customer review
CDG-BKK both legs in business. An excellent product definitely lot of space and a seat very close to first class standards. Excellent flat bed seat. But a very poor service food is ok very nice presentation but definitely on all the legs (4) the crew was under expectation. Very poor English so communication is difficult they just do the job with no real care of the customers.

AMM-MCT-KUL in business class. 1st leg (AMM-MCT) on their E170 fleet. Seat configuration in business is 1-2 and I took seat 2A (single seat). Nice seat for 3 hours flight with pre-departure hot towel and welcome drink. Cabin crew for this AMM-MCT flight weren't up to my expectations however the food was superb. Oman Air lounge in Muscat also good and cosy good selection of food and very ample. 2nd flight (MCT-KUL) was on their A330 aircraft. Superb seat amenities bag and cabin crew (they address me by name). Excellent inflight food. Inflight meal service is something you can't get on any ordinary business class meal service.

### Oman Air customer review
Check-in in BKK was disorganised. Lounge was a pleasant surprise quiet nice food. Flight was BKK-MCT-MUC. For my needs the seat was spacious but uncomfortable hard supports in the wrong places. Cabin staff tried very hard but service was patchy with too many misunderstandings none was a native English speaker. Food was of good quality but just nothing on the menu I liked mainly seafood and poultry no beef. White wine was not chilled at all. Over all they are trying but WY still has to smooth a few rough edges. It was my first trip with them. My next trip wont be.

LHR via MCT to Mumbai return. Good: leg room entertainment some in-flight staff. Poor: airline staff at Muscat were disorganised and unfriendly. Ground staff member at Heathrow was friendly but told us he'd given us emergency exit seats for the flight (my co-passenger is 6ft 4) and this turned out to be completely untrue. Had the feeling that if anything went wrong e.g. in-flight entertainment stopped working you'd be on your own. Food was poor. Delayed twice by one hour each time. No explanation for one delay the other was because the plane was 'waiting for important papers' for an hour once we had boarded. Muscat airport is small for a stopover but new airport is under construction.

### Oman Air customer review
Travelled from Munich to Abu Dhabi via Muscat return. I didn't expect such excellent levels of service especially on the main leg MUC-MCT-MUC. On boarding immediately offered drinks and followed up with introduction menus and quality meal selection with great service. The seats are very specious and comfortable. The transfer in Muscat was not that great as the airport there is very old and overcrowded. However the Business class lounge offers very good service. The return flight from MCT to MUC was delayed due to late arrival of a plane with transfer passengers to MUC. On that flight I received pyjamas - something I would expect only in first class.

### Oman Air customer review
Dar es Salaam to Muscat Muscat to Bangkok. Check in at Dar es Salaam was very poor - the economy class line was moving more quickly! No priority system for clearances or entry to Muscat. Service onboard was excellent but the plane was relatively old and had no personal IFE. Flight took off nearly 30 minutes early. This flight was 3 star and not as good as a comparable flight from Turkish Airlines to Kilimanjaro. There was a special bus in Muscat and my bag received special treatment off the plane. From Muscat to Bangkok it was a very good experience. A special and fast check in a comfortable flat bed good service and IFE until the plane had landed. Plane was an hour late but delay caused by European weather. Bag first off the plane. Definitely worth their 4 star rating.

### Oman Air customer review
Flew LHR via MCT to Colombo 25th Jan - 17th Feb 2013. Main leg from LHR to MCT and back on new Airbus A330 was super with no problems. The beds were brilliant as was the food and service etc. The problems began when we changed planes at Muscat onto ancient Boeing 737-700 for the 4hrs flight to Colombo. The seats did not recline - or do anything none of the controls worked. The staff were not interested - all they wanted to do was to talk amongst themselves. In fact the Business class steward and stewardess on the flight from Colombo to Muscat  talked so loudly that we in the first seats could not sleep or even relax. The service was appalling.

### Oman Air customer review
Flew to Bangkok via Muscat on their new A330s. Excellent cabin space and service can't fault either leg. We normally fly Qatar and Oman just about matched them except for the hub. Muscat is not a patch on Doha with it's dedicated business terminal.

### Oman Air customer review
Dubai - Muscat flight delayed 4 hours with no explanation. The crew on board seem they want to complete a task given to them so they are not ready to answer your request. I asked for a glass of water they asked me to wait as they will pass with water later on. The food includes the same apple pie as 3 years ago - no changes whatsoever. I called the cabin crew many times as I wanted to purchase something from duty free no one to respond to my call. They were busy wrapping up the flight before landing even 30 minutes prior to arrival. Simply bad experience with a high cost for the ticket.

### Oman Air customer review
CDG-MCT-KUL on 14 Jan. Overall experience was great. First leg delayed due to snow in Paris however they managed to arrive on time for my connecting flight to KUL. The seat was comfortable and the food great. I would like the flight attendants come around more often to provide more drinks.

### Oman Air customer review
Just a short hop from MCT to DXB. The staff were friendly the seats were wide and comfortable and the snack was nice. There was no IFE but it was only such a short flight that I didn't really mind. The lounge in MCT was really nice though very modern with a small area in the corner with comfortable seats and large ottomans for having a sleep or a nap before the flight.

### Oman Air customer review
CDG-MCT return. Cabin configuration: 1-2-1. Welcome drink with a bad Champagne. The crew never smiled. The main course was cold. Poor IFE. The Internet didn't work on both legs. No French announcement. Very disappointed.

### Oman Air customer review
LHR to BKK via Muscat. Fantastic experience using Oman Business Class and will certainly use again. Price was excellent for this route we did book 7 months in advance. the service was great staff very friendly. Great food. Seat comfort and extras great. Wi-fi and mobile use available inflight.

### Oman Air customer review
This was a six hour flight from Bangkok to Muscat. After the first hour the entertainment system packed up at my seat. I asked the flight attendant 4 times to do something about it. On each occasion he must have just pressed some sort of reset button but he never came back to check to see if it was working. On the fourth occasion of me asking he got quite irritated. I gave up in the end and spent a very boring flight without any entertainment. The flight attendant's attitude was one of he couldn't care less.

### Oman Air customer review
Flight KUL-MCT-ZRH economy class. Internal outfit is new probably the plane is new too. One thing that made a huge difference was that the leg space between the seats felt larger than other airlines. This made the journey comfortable. In-flight entertainment was great food was good too. But Oman Air is tied to MCT as its transit point MCT needs to upgrade itself to complement the great service of Oman Air.

### Oman Air customer review
Flying FRA-MCT-CMB in Business. Business Seats in A330 excellent lot of space fully flat. But the service was a nightmare extremely slow ineffective and not professional. Take-off at 9.45pm serving dinner at midnight. Appetizer and dessert good main course nothing special. The MCT-CMB sector with 3 hours delay no information no excuse. An old 737 Business seats not comparable with the A330 service not exist. Lounge in Frankfurt crowed with JAL Passengers Lounge in Muscat excellent. Overall not a pleasant journey.

### Oman Air customer review
London - Muscat - Bangkok return. All four sectors on time with good food and attentive service. The seats were comfortable and we were able to sleep for some of each flight. We would have only one complaint - not the fault of the airline - screaming children. On all four sectors the flight was marred by screaming infants. On our last sector one infant screamed for much of the journey and on the third section dad ignored screaming child and read his book oblivious to the discomfort of both the child and other passengers! Would we travel with them again? Most definitely! In terms of service comfort and value for money you cannot beat this airline - they give other Middle East airlines a 'run for their money'.

### Oman Air customer review
Paris-Muscat-Bangkok return in Business Class (December 21st 2012 and January 1st 2013). Wonderful experience. The seat is more comfortable than all the other business class seats I know and even some first class seats (only negative point: a lack of storage room in the middle seats). Very good food with a Top Chef cuisine and a very good service. Nice lounges in BKK and MCT with very good food. Definitely my favourite airline.

### Oman Air customer review
Bangkok-Muscat-London return journey on 28th December was better than the outbound journey to Bangkok but overall I felt the service cleanliness and food was good. The quality of service and food was better on the last leg to London. The plane was slightly more comfortable as it was a new aircraft but the aircon was too cold though. The flight was delayed by over an hour with no prior warning from the airline at Muscat which I though was poor.

### Oman Air customer review
AUH-MSC-BKK return in Y class. Finally an airline which offers a decent Y class product. Comfortable seats with a decent 34' pitch good food great IFE and competitive airfares. All flights arrived ahead of schedule. For me its the best ME airlines at the moment.

### Oman Air customer review
I was flying to Bangkok via Muscat and found the flight to be really good. Was also able to charge my gadgets via the USB ports next to the in flight screen while I watched some films which was very handy. The seats were comfortable on both legs and you had adequate room to stretch your legs but on the first leg I did have the unfortunate pleasure to have one annoying child who was too animated each time he watched a film and kept on fidgeting for 6 hours. The food was good and kept you going. Only downside on this trip was the stopover in Muscat which was 12 hours but I will not hold that against Oman air as the flight was cheap so cannot complain. In fact my next trip to Bangkok is with Oman air again and this time the stopover is very minimal.

### Oman Air customer review
FRA-MCT-BKK and return. Very nice experience. Good seat comfort and amenities. Quite good catering and choice of three meals wine was only okay though. Wide choice of inflight-entertainment.

### Oman Air customer review
London to Bangkok via Muscat and return. Great flight with no delays. Attentive crew on the whole save an odd crew member and relatively comfortable seats. In flight entertainment was good and amenity packs were provided. Faultless landing on all four flights and an all round positive experience. I will fly with Oman again having paid more for flights with other airlines with a less pleasurable outcome.

### Oman Air customer review
A very good airline. I flew Kuala Lumpur to Tehran and return via Muscat. The main serving of food is of a high standard and well-portioned they even provide dinner on the 2am 2-hour flight to Tehran. Crew are mostly helpful and professional bar a couple of sour exceptions. The inflight entertainment seems to change depending on the aircraft but my Muscat-KL flight had a huge range of music and movies. They also provide toothbrush socks eye mask etc to economy passengers which is nice. Let down was a two-hour delay leaving Tehran for which absolutely no apology or acknowledgement was received at any time.

### Oman Air customer review
LHR-MCT-BKK in business class - it is more of a first class service compared with other airlines cabins. The food was excellent on all legs the seat is huge in a 1x2x1 configuration great lounge in LHR MCT and BKK where Oman have their own lounge also. Crew were super on all legs only thing that lets it down is the IFE which is not as good as some other carriers but not a huge concern when your seat is so amazing. Have booked again and Oman Air is definitely my new favourite airline.

### Oman Air customer review
MXP-MCT-BKK and back. Great food (spicy chicken and other specialities) desserts and breakfast. Snack was not so great quite low standard for this airline. Highest pitch among the other airlines great comfort but unfortunately I was unable to sleep properly because of noisy passengers. The computer in the front seat provides movies music flight infos and so on. Cabin crew was super professional very friendly and always smiling.

### Oman Air customer review
DXB-MCT frequent flyer. Quite good service for such a short flight but nothing exceptional. Warm sandwiches are systematically served (a choice between sweet and savoury is sometimes available) however there is no beverage choice. Water and orange juice are complimentarily available within all the flight. Operated by Embraer 124 or Boeing 737-800 young and clean aircraft's. Muscat Airport and DXB Terminal 1 are both a pain but flights use to take off and arrive on time.

### Oman Air customer review
Second time flying Paris CDG - KUL return via Muscat. Very happy with the onboard service. Cabin crew attentive and professional. The seats were comfortable and the lounge facilities in Paris Muscat and Kuala Lumpur excellent. Just some minor comments regarding the limousine service Oman Air's website should not advertise this if it is not available for all business class passengers especially when booking online where only one business care fare appears to be available therefore limousine service should be made available. Oman Air may also want to include more Malay cuisine on their a la carte menu for destinations to and from Malaysia.

### Oman Air customer review
Muscat to Zanzibar. Outbound flight was ok food nothing special and entertainment poor but the crew were great. On the return leg (which was 7 hours long to accommodate a stop in Dar Es Salam) we had no drinks service virtually no entertainment poor food and only 2 crew members to serve 140 economy passengers Oman Air has got its premium routes but falls short of international standards on other routes.

### Oman Air customer review
Heathrow-Muscat-Mumbai return journey. Both flights friendly staff plenty of leg room and good quality food. Muscat Airport is good but with only 5.5 hrs stop a coffee and book filled the gap adequately. Seating was 2-4-2 so had no issues with a squashed middle person. My finding: a lot better than other airlines I have flown in the past.

### Oman Air customer review
I flew LHR-MCT (layover 24 hours) MCT-BKK and then BKK to LHR via MCT. Outbound flights the service was very good. Crew attentive and leg room comfortable for economy. Amenity packs given on each leg. Main meals were good but the snack pre-landing was bland. Return there was an older cabin crew member who seemed to take a back seat and allow the female crew to do most of the work. The MCT-LHR sector all staff ship shape and on target. Great airline and great prices. Only let down was the IFE a little dated.

### Oman Air customer review
My husband and I did an Oman Air Eid Package Tour to Sri Lanka in August. It was excellent value for money. The flights were on time and very pleasant. The vegetable curry that I had for dinner on our return trip was one of the best I have eaten. A range of alcohol was available for the passengers who fancied a drink with their meal.

### Oman Air customer review
Flew from Cairo to Muscat on 14th Sep 2012. Although I was first in line at the check in counter at Cairo I was given seat No. 20 C which is an emergency exit seat with minimum leg room and no reclining feature. As the flight was full I had to endure this for 4 hours. Although the crew were apologetic they could not help in any way and their apologies did not help in relieving my discomfort. Also no AC when the plane was on the tarmac in Cairo. All passengers should be asked before being allocated an emergency exit seat. The entertainment was almost non existent. I am not quite sure why they bother to distribute head sets. The food was also just average. All in all a rather nasty experience. I will say however that the onward flight from Muscat to Bombay was a bit better as there were some spare seats. Need to note here that my seat was broken and was fixed in the recline position. The food was also better on this flight but the entertainment was still pathetic.

### Oman Air customer review
Travelled from London Heathrow to Bangkok (Business Class). From arriving at check in to leaving at Bangkok I must say this is the best airline I have travelled with. The staff were excellent the menu was brilliant and the IFE was good. The lounge facilities at Heathrow Muscat and Bangkok all were excellent with free massages.

### Oman Air customer review
Business Class Kuala Lumpur to London. Excellent all the way. From the booking of the ticket in KL to the smooth check in and the wonderful service I couldn't have asked for any better. All sectors on time and the lounge in Muscat a delight.

JED-MCT-LHR. Friendly and fast check-in at both Jeddah and Muscat (we had a three day holiday stopover in Oman) great leg room and comfort entertainment on demand delicious food and wines punctual service and lovely crew. We were impressed by Oman Air and are tempted to use them regularly from Saudi Arabia to the UK despite three hours in the wrong direction on the first hop!

### Oman Air customer review
I got an exceptionally good business class deal with Oman Air when shopping around for fares from London to Bangkok. I am well-travelled and have used many airlines over the years in economy economy plus and business and have no hesitation in saying that this is quite simply the best carrier I have ever used. Oman Air's business class product is exceptional with an especially spacious cabin in a 1-2-1 configuration (the window seat giving you excellent storage space) a truly wonderful flat bed experience fantastic food brilliant service and absolutely fantastic crews on all four sectors of my journeys. The airline has great connection times in Muscat and a terrific lounge and also has its own lounge at Bangkok (small but really comfortable and with great service).

### Oman Air customer review
Use Oman Air as fly ZRH-MCT-DEL often due to business now that there is a direct ZRH connection. Find aircraft entertainment and catering great but the last touch on service i.e. staff service is still modest. Need more attention to detail like checking on drinks and not completely disappearing.

### Oman Air customer review
Colombo-Muscat-Paris in Business. First leg on a narrow body Boeing 737. Fine service with comfortable seats. Does however not match the Business Class on their long haul A 330 fleet which is really another story with great seats and exquisite first class like service. Lounge in Muscat outstanding. However as a couple occupying the two middle seats one is served by two different cabin crew which are not always well synchronized so while one has already the table set up with a complete meal it can happen that your travel companion is watching you without being served anything. Also the priority tagging of the baggage did not work at all in Paris and while we were the first off the plane many Economy passengers left the terminal before us. Still wonderful service at a good price.

### Oman Air customer review
Bangkok-Muscat-Bangkok. Oman Air's lounge in Bangkok is excellent along with their flagship in Muscat. Service superb though some flight attendant's seem to disappear after the meal service which is the only slight downside. This airline seems to get better and better every flight.

MUC-MCT-MUC: Second time flying with them in a year. Same good experience. Very good seat and food selection. Towel and amenity kit provided. Staff friendly. Outbound flight was delayed but inbound flight was on time. Entertainment is plentiful and worked fine. 10MB Wireless for 15 USD is a nice add-on to keep in touch with the outside world during the flight. Overall very good experience and recommended.

### Oman Air customer review
FRA–MCT-BKK-MCT-LHR seat pitch good on all flights but food  AVOD service average and patchy. MCT–BKK They rush you to your connecting flight to leave you sat on runway in the heat without aircon or the offer of water on one flight a large family /group of about 20 passengers bullied other passengers into moving seats so they could sit together. The flight crew lost control and there was an intimidating atmosphere. I saw one poor woman in tears the crew had moved her out of her seat to accommodate the bullies and then could not find a seat for her. They asked her to stand at the back near the toilet and wait until they found her a seat. One of the crew tried to get her into business class but that started an argument with 3 other crew. All this was going on in the heat on a cramped delayed aircraft. No announcement about the delay or why the aircon was not on.

### Oman Air customer review
Economy very good. Seats are comfortable and similar space to BA's premium economy. Lunch/dinner very good. Snack not so good. All travel was on time.

### Oman Air customer review
Return flight MPX-MCT-KUL. A330 aircraft's on all 4 legs in good condition reasonable leg room tasteful food in adequate quantities nice set of amenities big personal screens. However cabin crew completely disinterested and disorganized on all 4 legs. No greetings when boarding or leaving the plane no smiles. Tried to serve the food as quick as possible and then disappeared for hours. The lavatories weren't checked/cleaned during the flights.

### Oman Air customer review
LHR-MCT return. Check-in at LHR very quick and very helpful we were moved to better seats than those available on online check-in. Service was excellent and food better than average. On return flight again service very good. Would definitely use again and highly recommend. However return flight slightly marred by screaming children a difficult issue for airlines to resolve in economy. I would happily pay a premium for a flight restricted to children 10 years and over.

### Oman Air customer review
Business class from Jeddah to BKK via Muscat. It is surprisingly a fine experience. Onboard the welcome and service are superb. Seats are very good and the food selection is excellent although there is a tendency to spice all dishes. Lounges in Bangkok and Muscat are most relaxing and comfortable. The ground staff at the BKK lounge is an experience by itself: warm-welcoming helpful always smiling and superbly attending to passengers.

### Oman Air customer review
ZRH-MCT-KUL return in Business Class. Could find a good last minute deal with them and wanted to try out their great business class seat. Check-in was quick but lounge in Zurich is a bit minimalistic. Onboard was served champagne and received a hot towel amenity kit and menu. Seat is really great and like first class on European airlines. Food served is delicious and presented like first class where each course is served as in a restaurant and nothing is pre-plated on a tray. Service is the only thing that needs improvement as some crew members lack the warmth and professionalism of other world class carriers. Muscat airport is small and convenient and the lounge has a great food spread and a complimentary spa with free massages. I felt these were brilliant. All flights on time and I think Oman Air delivers a great business class hard product but needs to work on their staff training to become world class.

### Oman Air customer review

CDG-MCT-BKK-MCT-CDG business class. Check-in was fast and ground staff prepared in advance all boarding pass lounge invite and fast track passes. Paris lounge is AA and not so good but in MCT and BKK WY lounge are lovely with lots of food and drinks. Onboard seats are very generous 180 degree flat bed with 17" monitor but a bit hard and OVOD new film choice is limited. Food served restaurant style on elegant crockery cutlery and glassware. Crew are of mixed nationality and depending on the segment ranged from efficient to bad - mostly disappearing after meal service. However always very polite. All in all a good value for money but can do with some basic improvements.

### Oman Air customer review
CDG-MCT return in Business class. Fantastic service. A330-200 brand new on outbound flight and almost new on return. Ground staff very nice in CDG (less in MCT) but cheap AA lounge in CDG. Excellent seat onboard: wide and comfortable. Food was very tasty excellent products. Good champagne and great wines. IFE was excellent with plenty of good films in many languages great audio headset. Lounge in Muscat was very cosy great choice of dishes champagne and smiling staff. Onboard FAs were always smiling. On return one FA had trouble serving champagne and latter dropped a glass. Yet other FAs were extremely professional and attentive. Addressed by my name onboard on return flight. Food very nice but less tasty from MCT. WY's business class is a fantastic product only lacking a little more training for some FAs and a better lounge in CDG.

DOH-MCT-BKK outbound and return. DOH-MCT on E175 superb seating friendly and professional crew. MCT- BKK there was a change of aircraft (plane was a Gulf Air wetlease - does not compare to WY cabin though service was friendly). Business Class Lounge in MCT is outstanding with friendly staff and excellent selection. On return BKK WY lounge was excellent staff did check-in for me to save the hassle of the transfer desk lounge was busy but enough comfortable seating. Staff were responsive to requests and provided a great service. Transfer in MCT again easy. Was only J passenger on MCT-DOH cabin and impressed that WY organised a special J bus to collect me and to take me to the terminal. Was in the office less than 40 mins after landing.

LHR-MCT in business. Transferred in to LHR from KLM and went to the airside transfer desk to find it closed. Had to wait for gate staff to arrive to obtain a boarding pass however they didn't know how to get my baggage onto the flight (which had been checked through). Managed to get a drink and something to eat in the No.1 lounge which was very good. Business class product onboard is the best in the world. Excellent flight excellent crew. Baggage arrived a few days later and got 10 rials compensation.

Business class from Paris CDG-Kuala Lumpur return via Muscat. Excellent cabin very comfortable seats with a lot of privacy. Cabin crew very attentive and showed great customer service. Entertainment onboard had a great variety of choices. Lounge in Paris CDG Muscat and golden lounge in Kuala Lumpur all had a great selection of food and drinks. The only gripe is that despite having booked business class I was told I was not eligible for the limousine service. I was also disappointed that dining onboard was not "on demand". Overall it was great value for business class.

### Oman Air customer review
LHR-MCT-BKK return. Outbound ok. Decent seat pitch in economy and meals plentiful. Muscat has no airbridges so it's all bus transfers. MCT is a small airport with limited food and beverage facilities. Return leg delayed on departure from BKK meaning there was only 15 mins in MCT to get my connecting flight to LHR. Upon clearing Customs I was ushered to the gate for connecting flight. Reaching the aircraft we were told there would be a further delay as connecting flight from Katmandu was late. In the end we were 1.5 hrs late. Arrived in London 1.5 hrs late. All in all I cannot complain. AVOD is ok but not the latest releases. For the price vs service pretty good all round.

### Oman Air customer review
In theory fantastic product but in reality they did not deliver for us at all. LHR-MCT-BKK KUL-MCT-LHR. Managed to get emergency exit seats which was the only bonus. Cabin crew service very inconsistent. Very good on LHR-MCT very poor on the rest of the flights. KUL-MCT hot towel thrown at me. Food acceptable but had better with Qatar and Emirates. IFE good but sometimes difficult to navigate. Ground staff in MCT awful. Asked to upgrade to C (and pay the full price) and left waiting for the price for over 45 minutes after which we just left their "counter".

### Oman Air customer review
ZRH-MCT-ZRH (first leg with a stop in MXP). Nice flight both ways. Good inflight entertainment (big screen large variety of recent films). Ground staff in MCT very kind helping us to properly pack a painting we bought in Oman and was too big to take into the cabin. The painting survived without a scratch. Baggage allowance is 30kg in economy class rather than the usual 20kg.

London Heathrow to Bangkok via Muscat return. Use of NO 1 lounge at Heathrow was very good indeed although quite busy. Food and drink were plentiful. Onboard A330-300 1-2-1 configuration so everyone has aisle access. Seat is extremely comfortable and a full 180 degree flat bed with 17" monitor. Crew service and attentiveness excellent. Food was good quality and quantity spot on. Muscat and Bangkok lounges were excellent. Entertainment not very extensive with no new real releases of movies. One crew member remembered me by name on my return journey after 2 weeks and I found that impressive. Fast track immigration at BKK and LHR a huge bonus.

### Oman Air customer review
Dubai-Muscat-Bangkok. Apart from the 0600 departure from Dubai and a 3 hour wait in Muscat everything else was splendid. My business class fare was cheaper than certain airline's economy class. B737-800 from Dubai to Muscat and A330-200 Muscat to Bangkok. Business Class on A330 is configured with 1-2-1 seating layout. Nice cabin colours nice lighting and authentic Omani decorations throughout the cabin. The seats convert into full-flat beds and segregated into individual pods. Privacy is optimum. Exceptional food and presentation good quality and quantity. Cabin crew very responsive. Perhaps just some slightly wider choice in the AVOD would make it perfect.

London - Muscat - Salalah. Good flights oOnly problem was they had closed the check in desk at Muscat for the flight to Salalah an hour before take off.

Bangkok-Paris Frankfurt-Bangkok. From check-in was escorted through customs to the lounge. Service I've experienced in First Class with other airlines but this was Business Class. Food is restaurant style. Excellent wines and nice amenity kit. Seat fully flat and the cabin attendants make your bed linen sheet and duvet including large pillows. Friendly attendants. Lounge in Muscat is very good including their new part of the airport which is getting built around the current.

CMB-Muscat-BAH in Business class. All flights on time the seat is fantastic lie flat and as good as many First Class's in many airlines. Food was served silver service and was of very good quality good wines and all aperitifs available. Entertainment was good but not as good as other carriers. Staff were all pleasant and attentive when required. Some polish could be advised as most are quite young. Lounge at Muscat is top marks with vast array of foods and drinks. To be recommended and will definitely use again.

LHR to Muscat and Muscat to BKK return in Business Class. Excellent new airline with a fantastic Business Class offering great Business Class seat price as well. Easy check-in good lounges amazing seat/flat bed staff onboard friendly and great service. Flat bed was great and got a good sleep in pyjamas provided on the way to Muscat. Seat comfortable and goes fully flat. Food/Beverages offered. New Business Class lounge in Muscat is excellent. I would highly recommend Oman Air due to their great Business Class seat at a reasonable price.

The seats are very comfortable and was able to get a good nights rest. The only negative was the ground handling staff in Muscat they where rude and not interested in J class passengers.

MCT-KUL. The initial experiences were positive. Business lounge in Muscat was comfortable and staff attentive. Onboard the seat lived up to its reputation. There was a lot of wasted storage space in my opinion which was too small to be useful for cabin baggage but yet too big to look anything short of clumsy and a cheap gap- filler. Inflight service food IFE and crew all positive. On arrival into KUL my bag had been lost and this is where the airline and my entire experience fell down. The local staff were not readily on hand and certainly made very little effort once tracked down. It took about 36 hours to receive my bag and the promised delivery times were seemingly mere fabrications since they came and went on two occasions without any sign of my bags so all this did was to further build upon my frustrations. As a full fare paying premium passenger I expect an airline to jump into action when things go wrong and there was absolutely none of that. All contact was initiated by me at great expense and the airline failed to take a single pro-active step to manage the situation or reputation. Eventually I realized that they knew my bag was delayed by 24hrs even before I arrived into KUL but simply failed to take any action on the information. So a pleasurable experience turned very sour because the airline did not appear to have control interest or regret when something went wrong. The entire approach including the subsequent lack of interest from the head office leads me to question how serious this airline really is about competing within the region.

LHR-MCT-SLL-MCT-LHR. A330-300 sectors in comfortable new aircraft with great leg space. Satisfactory food and drinks with bottled water available thoughout flight. Biscuits and ice cream on return flight. GF main course served to my wife was bland on both sectors but happily exchanged by crew for biryani on return sector. B737-800 sectors both satisfactory with GF meals served on these 1hr flights. Oman Air offer good value Economy flights and I look forward to my next flights with them to KTM in Nov.

LHR-MCT-SLL-MCT-LHR. London to Muscat sectors were in a fairly new A330-300ER with good IFE. The service and meals were adequate and complimentary alcohol was available on request. My wife's GF main courses were bland and boring and on the homeward sector exchanged on request for the tasty biriani. Crew members mostly friendly and obliging. Leg room great for tall travellers and seemed more generous than the stated 34". Mobile phones can be used inflight and WiFi is available both at additional cost. Main criticism of these flights is that the crew make no effort to keep the toilets clean on these 7-8hr flights. Muscat to Salalah sectors in B737-800 with a meal served on the 1 hr flight. On the basis of these experiences I'm travelling LHR-MCT-KTM in November this year.

Just flown with Oman Air yesterday. Entertainment great. Food was poor. Flown with Oman Air 4 times and all 4 times the chicken option wasn't available due to shortage. Yet the passengers sitting on the other aisle across still had the choice after to which I was very disappointed as due to my seat location I wasn't able to select the chicken meal. To happen every time I fly with Oman Air I now do not look forward to meals with this airline. Also was given a snack consisting of fruit and a bread roll filled with veg. Again annoyed but this time at the hostess as she gave me this snack only for myself and to realise after that there was a meat alternative to which she didn't inform us yet she informed the row of passengers in front. I complained to another hostess only for nothing to be done. Would strongly recommend selecting food before flying.

Business class to Bangkok via Muscat. Newish airline trying hard to compete with the big names and doing very well indeed. Standard of business class seats on Oman are superior to Etihad - newer more comfortable seats more space and excellent in flight entertainment with Bose headphones. Staff very courteous check in fast and efficient food superior & drinks were flowing. The only thing that was really average was the lounge at Terminal 3 - looked old and dated. In contrast the new lounge at Muscat is great with a very attractive layout of various food. Shame the lounge was invaded by loud mobile phone speakers and other inconsiderate people.

### Oman Air customer review
MCT-DXB in Business Class. Easy check-in at MCT and Business Class lounge is great with a wide selection of food and drink. A separate bus to the aircraft for Business Class and the welcome was warm on almost new B737-800. A snack of sandwiches and cake served together with drinks - even managed a second round on this 45min sector. Arrival on time and cleared of the airport in 15 minutes.

LHR-BKK via MCT. SAS lounge at LHR spacious and comfortable. Onboard food wine entertainment lie-flat seat and service from cabin crew all excellent. Cabin crew quietly conspicuous throughout the flight and anticipated top-ups. Lounge at MCT excellent. Streets ahead of Emirates and Etihad.

### Oman Air customer review
LHR-MCT-CMB return A330-300 on all sectors. Economy full on all sectors but experience seemed calm and efficient. Food was standard economy fare and drinks service offered (it is not a dry airline). Inflight entertainment very good with seat-back screens. Oman Air offer in- flight wifi and you can use your mobile phone via Inmarsat connection. I was impressed with Oman Air's service at a competitive price.

LHR-MCT-BKK return. Having booked well in advance was annoyed to receive email informing us of schedule change (don't Oman know their schedules for the year?) with two options : cut short trip by three days or extend by one. No offer to compensate for either loss of holiday or extension expense. Online check in is a farce only one sector can be checked in and a seat selected. Ended up row 23 LHR-MCT but row 44 MCT-BKK. Same on the reverse journey row 23 BKK- MCT row 44 MCT-LHR. Of the 8 flights with Oman on this route in the past six months IFE has worked only once. Crew range from attentive to disinterested. Food has taken a nose dive in the last six months. MCT-LHR flight at least 7 rows were denied a drinks service as a 'senior' staff member resented being told she had forgotten to do it and sulked. For the first time ever had to use the call button to ask for a drink with meal and get IFE reset after a promise to rectify went undone. Have used Oman Air's OnAir product successfully once. Good wifi speed but at $29.95 its very expensive. Decided to treat ourselves to OnAir on the MCT-LHR (longest leg). Worked fine for 20 minutes then crashed and crew couldn't have cared less. Oman is great when its good and absolutely appalling when its bad. The planes are new so they say. Am going to give Oman one last try in October.

LHR-MCT-BKK-MCT-BKK. Full flat seat and overall cabin space extremely comfortable food and drinks excellent as are the cabin staff. Muscat business lounge very good.

### Oman Air customer review
FRA-MCT-CMB return. The seat pitch is generous inflight entrainment great food was good flight attendants friendly service good. Great value for money economy class product. The only negative complaining points were some delays on the FRA-MCT flights (due to weather and on the MCT-CMB flight (due to technical reasons) and the stop in Male on the MCT-CMB flight.

### Oman Air customer review
LHR-Muscat-Trivandrum return. Staff were surly and arrogant service almost non existent (we had to ask many times for our meal then provided something completely different) our one drink of wine did not materialise. Then we were told the company policy was not to serve "drunken passengers"! When I complained the chief steward showered my wife and I with gifts and an apology but the damage had been done. Add to this the pools of water in both toilets. Incidentally we are not drinkers and had not had any alcoholic drinks prior to our flight. We merely wanted some refreshment with our food.

### Oman Air customer review
BKK to LHR via MCT. A tale of two halves. BKK to MCT flight was excellent staff very attentive and interacted with passengers. The cabin is excellent as are seats. Lounge at Muscat is small but quiet and relaxing. Food options well presented. The 2nd flight was disappointing. Having made the mistake of ordering vegetarian food the crew were oblivious to the fact that the meal presented was third rate. No alternatives offered and we went the whole flight without any food. The cabin crew seemed to spend most of their time talking among themselves. Four staff for 16 passengers but little interaction and no customer service. This illustrates the inconsistencies in standards at Oman. At their best they are as good an any airline but at their worst they are poor. There is an urgent need to achieve greater consistency.

### Oman Air customer review
Me and my partner got our flight to Bangkok scheduled for April/May. They tried to reschedule our flight in February for later dates we had made arrangements for hotels/flights after few days they went back to original timetable. Of course they did not even consider taking any costs of our arrangements! Appalling customer service. And today the same story - again they want to reschedule a flight and the reason is "something to do with switching from their Winter Schedule to their Summer schedule and being a young airline they are quite inexperienced at this". They have already ruined our vacations with such irresponsible behaviour. They are not worth all the hassle even though they've got competitive price.

### Oman Air customer review
LHR-MCT-BKK return great value for money paid €540 pp return. Flights on time  good flight entertainment. Crew efficient and friendly adequate amount of drink and food services. Would fly with Oman Air again.

### Oman Air customer review
Economy class conditions seemed to be more cramped than on other airlines and crew surly. Their complaints handling is a disgrace. We had a brand new suitcase destroyed on the return leg. We reported the damage immediately at Heathrow and got a customer reference number. Since then I e-mailed the customer service address with copies of a whole load of documents (mostly irrelevant to my claim but I supplied them anyway). The first response was a blanket "sorry to her your problem but we are not liable". When I pressed it further I was told "We are not liable because the damage is fair wear and tear". When I pointed out why this was utter rubbish and gave chapter and verse from their terms and conditions I have just been ignored. Seems like their idea of customer service just means "deny everything but do it politely".

### Oman Air customer review
LHR-MCT-BKK. Good IFE and very empty flight. Crew were fine food was edible not as good as some airlines but I've hadworse. MCT-BKK flight was completely full and cabin crew obviously couldn't cope and had no hesitation in showing so. Food seemed better on this leg. BKK-MCT cabin crew very attentive - I was unwell on the way back and I was upgraded during the flight. I was fortunate to have a faulty seat belt MCT-LHR and was upgraded again.

### Oman Air customer review
LHR-MCT-BKK. Good selection of food well presented. Cabin crew attentive but not overbearing. Lounge in Muscat comfortable with good selection of food and facilities. Shared Emirates lounge in Bangkok.

### Oman Air customer review
Heathrow-Muscat-Bangkok return journey. Both flights friendly staff plenty of leg room and good quality food. Muscat Airport has little to do needs an internet cafe but with only 3 hours stop a coffee and book filled the gap adequately. Seating was 2-4-2 so had no issues with a squashed middle person.

### Oman Air customer review
To and from Bangkok via Muscat and very impressed. Seating comfortable with good legroom food also high quality. No issues when ordering drinks. On the way to Bangkok the two or so hours wait wasn't too bad although over £6 a beer was excessive. On the way back I paid to use the lounge as it was 3 hours stopover very good value. Lounge nice and quiet with food and drinks available also cubicles to catch up on sleep if needed.

### Oman Air customer review
LHR-COK via MCT . They seem to have got the economy seat configuration about right. I'm 6'4" and although not exactly comfortable did not suffer the discomfort I have endured on other airlines. Food okay and IFE comprehensive - although the free headphones are about as cheap as you can get. Punctuality was good on all sectors and Muscat is a pleasant environment to wait for a connection. I do have one issue though. I appreciate Oman is an Islamic state and some of the cabin crew probably do not approve of alcohol. But on the first leg LHR-MCT when my partner developed a headache and asked for a paracetamol she was told that she couldn't have one as she had been drinking alcohol! Yes she had had a 330ml of Fosters and one 18.5ml bottle of red wine in the previous 6 hours but to deny a customer a painkiller on these grounds is ridiculous and poor customer care. Then on the return flight from Muscat I requested a Gin and Tonic and was told there was no Gin on board - this was about 30mins after leaving Muscat. I think Oman air need to decide whether they are going to be a dry Islamic airline a point of view I would respect or have a liberal Western attitude to reasonable alcohol consumption.

### Oman Air customer review
LHR-MCT-LHR. Oman Air have one of the better Economy products. New A330-300 with 34" seat pitch good food and IFE attentive service and convenient flight times. Booking online was followed by a lengthy pantomime email correspondence having to send them scanned pictures of your passport and credit card to avoid fraud. Apart from that a good journey.

### Oman Air customer review
Delighted with recent flight London Heathrow to Mumbai via Muscat. The entertainment and food were excellent as was service. We were given a huge bag of nuts and some ice cream in addition to two meals on the 7 hour flights to and from Muscat. There wasn't much to do at Muscat airport for our 5 hour stop so take a good book if you have a long stop there!

### Oman Air customer review
Paris to Malé through Muscat. Business class of very high standard. Very friendly professional staff take care of you till the end of the flight (not disappearing as Air France staff do). Seats huge full lie-flat so it's possible to find comfortable position and sleep. Seats by windows have lots of storage  however seats in the middle have limited storage. Excellent food classy presentation. Lounge in Muscat very comfortable with plenty of drinks and food. All in all excellent product.

### Oman Air customer review
FRA to MLE via MCT Business class. Lounge in FRA is the lounge of Cathay Pacific not so much to eat. Seats 1-2-1 configuration wonderful flat bed. enough storage space. large screen. huge choice of movies TV Music. Good food but less choice than Etihad. FRA to MCT was a night flight and we received pyjamas crew even offer to prepare bed for you. Lounge in Oman is new and comfortable with lot of choice of food.

### Oman Air customer review
LHR to BKK via MCT. Full flat seats excellent as is the cabin ambience. Cabin crew friendly but language skills not as good as Qatar. Food good but food on demand not so good. The lounge at Muscat quiet and relaxed but not such a good selection of food nor such good shower facilities as I had become used to in Doha.

### Oman Air customer review
A flight by my partially sighted and physically disabled brother from LHR to Bangkok via Muscat. Caught in the snow at Heathrow eventually he was put on a flight on 22nd December to Muscat in Business class. The ground support and handling throughout the journey was good allowing full access to ground facilities. Business class passengers helped with food toilet and access in the cabin. However due to the design of the A330 multimedia and visual signalling within the cabin was not available. The second leg of this flight was economy class. Again the ground handling seemed very good. However the staff seemed very inexperienced in seat selection and he was placed somewhere in the middle of the cabin. This meant that he could not access the toilet on board without the group effort of some 20 passengers to navigate the cabin. He was trapped in the toilet once there as it was not apparent how to unlock the door. The food was wrapped in dark plastic sealed containers which could not be accessed by a partially sighted person resulting some 5 hours plus with no water food disorientated unable to call for help and restricted access for disabled aids despite requests for a suitable seat location 1 week earlier.

### Oman Air customer review
BKK-MUS-LHR. Excellent on time new A330. Plane half empty had an entire row of 4 seats to myself on 1st leg and 3 seats empty on the 2nd leg. Excellent seat pitch and great IFE. Good menu choices.

### Oman Air customer review
BKK-MCT-FRA. Plane had a broken engine twice. No help from Oman Air staff at all. It was shambolic. The only comment was" we are waiting for our engineer". Arrived in FRA 38 hours late with different airline. If I can help it I will never fly Oman Air again.

### Oman Air customer review
Ruined my holidays the only one of the year. Because of the bad weather and subsequent cancellations instead of putting me on the second available flight (the first would have been for people who had booking prior to mine) they tried to push me on Christmas day flight and give priority to people whose booking was on a date later than mine. As half of my holiday had gone I saw no point and cancelled.

### Oman Air customer review
Bangkok to Paris had technical problem in Bangkok and maintenance could not fix it and we had to spend a night at Bangkok. From the moment we left the plane to the following morning at the airport Oman Air staff was invisible and we only had information from the Bangkok airport crisis number (witch is very efficient). The following morning Oman Air told us we would take off at 1130am and spend a 23hr transit at Muscat before taking our second plane to France. The technical problem had not been fixed and we had to change for another plane. We arrived Muscat at 630pm instead of 230pm. Baggage didn't follow. As in Bangkok we didn't meet any Oman Air staff in the hotel and had great difficulty to collect information. Our plane to Paris took of on time but we arrived at destination with a 36 hours delay. Due to those awful conditions I think Oman Air's staff was not very helpful. A french speaking mediator in Muscat and a better coordination between the company and hotels where we spent the 2 nights would have been helpful (60 people were concerned).

### Oman Air customer review
FRA-MCT-CMB return in Business class. MCT-CMB with B737-800 as departure on a Monday. A330 is used on all other days. Due to this aircraft no sleeper seats - only usual short haul equipment. Apart from this excellent cabin on other flights with A330-300/200. Seat configuration in J class is 1x2x1. Very good service good entertainment available. Problems with food - not enough vegetarian pasta available on CMB-MCT. Cabin crew on leg MCT-FRA was too noisy talking whole night too loud.
