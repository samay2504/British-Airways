### "think twice before booking Belavia"
Мою супругу летящую сегодня транзитом через Минск не выпустили из аэропорта даже со справкой отрицательного результата Covid, так что ей придется ночевать в аэропорту. Несмотря что это разрешается постановлением совмина РБ N 624. Так что хорошо подумайте перед покупкой авиабилетов Belavia через Минск. My wife travelling on transit Belavia flights via Minsk was just not allowed to exit the airport, even with negative Covid test, so has to sleep in the airport tonight. This is in a contraction with the resolution N 624, regulating border control during pandemic period. So think twice before booking Belavia tickets via Minsk.

### "taken my money and ignored me"
Flew with this airline a few times and each time was OK. Then in May 2020 i booked a ticket from Kazakhstan back to the UK via Minsk. They then cancelled the flight a couple of days before due to COVID. I followed instructions and applied for a refund/credit for the price I paid which was just less than 300 Dollars. I filled in the appropriate document and sent it along with the eticket, a copy of my passport etc. I have since emailed them multiple times. It is now September and I have not heard a single thing from them they have just taken my money and ignored me. Disgraceful.

### "asking for money rebooking flights"
Not Verified |  Poor customer service. Covid has made life miserable for all of us. Belavia does not care about government restrictions and recommendations. Only company asking for money rebooking flights because of Covid and not caring about any government restrictions and recommendations. Extra fees are sent to be paid by email link and needs to be paid in 5 hours.

### "overall it's a decent product"
Minsk to Gatwick. The airport in Minsk looks like it has been renovated recently and it was modern and efficient. Boarding was slightly delayed but we got to Gatwick on time. The aeroplane was fairly comfortable and you get a bit more room in an Embraer which has a 2x2 seating configuration. The food and beverages were quite good and the aeroplane had some cool branding featuring a tank-based computer game that was developed in Belarus. Cabin crew were a little gruff and could have been warmer and more welcoming, but overall it's a decent product and good value for money.

### "good value for money"
I was travelling from London to Minsk via Amsterdam for a holiday in Belarus. I just about made my connection and the boarding process was efficient and ground crew friendly. The Embraer was quite roomy inside because there are only two seats to a row. The staff spoke English but not well and the level of friendliness and customer service was adequate but lower than you would find in a western airline. We arrived in Minsk a little bit ahead of schedule and I thought the airport there seemed modern and efficient. The food and drink on board were quite good. The airline is good value for money and their online booking process was very clear and easy to use.

### "Staff was really nice"
Tel Aviv to Minsk. Amazing flight, no delays, we boarded quickly, clean aircraft, really comfy seats and the food was great - choice between sausages and beef and we got a waffle, cherries, bread with the the meal. Staff was really nice, no complaints.

### "this flight was rather nice"
Moscow Domodedovo to Minsk. My previous experience with this airline was quite negative, but this time, there were almost nothing critical to complain on. The procedure of online booking and check in was smooth and quick, recently Belavia introduced low-cost tariffs (without checked baggage, etc) which allowed to make prices more reasonable. Ground procedures in Domodedovo were rather slow but this is not an airline's fail. On-board experience was great - I was lucky to get modern aircraft because Belavia still operates some ancient Boeing 737 Classic but this time it was a new B738 instead. Cabin crew were awesome. There was even a meal service (ham/cheese sandwiches) despite the flight is just 1h long. What was rather disappointing - bussing to terminal instead of jet bridge both in DME and MSQ. Maybe they have a reason for this, but in both airports I saw a lot of vacant jet bridges. Also - cabin was very cramped like in low-cost carriers. Possibly they are managing to cut costs in such a way. I criticize Belavia often for 'cosmic' prices on European destinations, for old aircraft, for monopoly on flying to MSQ from several destinations (especially European), for 'Soviet-style' of management that one can face sometimes - but this particular flight was rather nice.

### "Very bad reputation"
Gatwick to Minsk. I had to change ticket and they charged €50 euro for per ticket but never gave me back the price difference. It’s not only that I had sent them 4 emails but no reply from customer service. Very bad reputation. Avoid this airline by any cost.

### "airport Belavia employees really rude"
Saint Petersburg to Minsk. So first hosts was good, no problem about them. But in airport Belavia employees was really rude. Same week I had 2 more flights with Delta and Air France and did not have any problem like this. I will never flight with Belavia anymore.

### "A very pleasant flight"
Minsk to Gatwick. A very pleasant flight. Boarding was quick, the aircraft was clean and the seating was 3+3. Leg room was adequate. The flight took off on time and landed on time. Meal service consisted of a standard hot meal with soft drinks and tea or coffee. No alcohol was offered. This was a short 2 1/2 hrs flight and so the meal was very good. There was no in-flight entertainment.

### "company is always on time"
This is the only option to fly from Rome to Minsk as direct flight. The good thing is that you don't need to worry about any extra cost: the economy fare has everything you need, from free seat allocation to checked-in luggage plus hand luggage. Meal is also free of charge even if it can be improved or having some more variety. Staff is professional and kind and the planes are clean. One good benefit is that the company is always on time. Overall it is a very good company, they must just improve the food quality and variety. The website must be improved, specifically the possibility to make change of your reservation. The magazine on board must be in English as well.

### "does its job pretty well"
Moscow to Saint Petersburg via Minsk. Belavia is not a particularly fancy airline in terms of additional services or features, but it does its job pretty well. All flights were on time, crew very polite, online check-in worked as expected. The planes were not particularly new, but well maintained. The seat comfort could be better, but for short flights it is sufficient.

### "didn't expect such nice service"
Tel Aviv to Minsk. Aircraft refurbished inside with light blue seats, quite comfortable. Full service airline with low cost rates. A hot meal is served with a variety of beverages and smiles. I didn't expect such nice service. Crew was visible and happy to assist.

### "airline is simple, but it works"
Flew Belavia from Kiev to Moscow via Minsk. I read a review saying that they wanted to charge 200 dollars if you dont have the boarding pass, and made sure I had mine, but then at the airport they even printed a new one and said the boarding pass was free. I can´t be sure its always like that, but that is what they told me. Ryanair would not print you a new boarding pass, so I guess boarding pass is free. The airline is simple, but it works. Its better than extreme low cost like Ryanair in my opinion, luggage is included, etc. 2 flights for 93 euros and this service seems good to me.

### "the worst airline"
Paris to Minsk. This is probably the worst airline I've ever used. The seats are ok, but other than that everything is an absolute nonsense. I've never seen this rude staff ever in my life! Worst nightmare it could be. Customer service is real awful, can't even describe it with words, the flight can make you feel like crying.

### "horrible customer service"
A flight attendant needed to check my carry on bag because the plane ran out of overhead space. He then assured me that my bag would either be at the gate or at baggage claim. It was at neither so I filed a lost bag claim with Warsaw's airport. The airline did absolutely nothing to keep me updated on the status of my bag. I have to call and email them every day just to ask if they are looking for it and it seems they are not. They continue to say "there is no update on your bag. It has now been five days and I do not know if my bag is in Minsk or in Warsaw and when I will get it back. That is horrible customer service plain and simple. I have had my luggage lost before and it was found and delivered to me within 48 hours. The fact that it has been nearly a week and my bag has not even been located is absolutely ridiculous. I do not recommend Belavia. Customers should spend their money with a more respectable company with better customer service.

### "Awful experience"
Minsk to Astana. Awful experience. Flight attendants gave me the impression I was being discriminated for not speaking Russian. The other passengers were allowed to move freely while they kept telling me to go to my seat because of "turbulence". When I confronted them eventually they stopped it. Poor food and beverage quality. Old airplane. But the worst thing was the service. They didn't even give me an immigration card.

### "clean with adequate leg room"
After having visited Minsk for three days I choosed to book Belavia back to Prague. Check in procedure was smooth, waiting area at the gate quite small but with a nice adjacent cafe. Bus transfer to the aircraft. It was not the most modern B737 but perfectly clean with adequate leg room. The crew distributed sweets before take off, then to my great surprice a nice snack comprising a sandwich with sausages and cheese was served. Tea directly from the can or coffee was served. Quite a surprise nowadays, when nothing is offered free of charge on major European carriers for such a short trip 1hr 20 min. The captain gave inflight info over the loudspeaker system. We landed on time in Prague and I will not hesitate to book Belavia again.

### "better airlines than this one"
Minsk to Kaliningrad. Our flight was delayed for a few hours because of "weather conditions at the destination airport". I checked the arrivals in our destination airport and figured that there were other airlines landing at the same time with no issues. Only our flight was delayed, because (as I guess) they put a small plane that cannot tolerate any deviations in weather. The Belavia manager at the airport was absolutely unhelpful and even didn't try to solve this situation. In conclusion I really advise to never fly with Belavia. There are way better airlines than this one.

### "I will choose Belavia again"
Brussels Charleroi to Minsk. It was my first time to fly Belavia. The flight was OK, the crew was very friendly and helpful (although English is still a problem), I had more than enough space on my seat (I am 1.95M) and my knees did not even touch the back of the seat in front of me. Return flight, same story. Nice and friendly crew. We got some sweets, something to drink (water or juice) and a small lunch (chicken or pork), coffee, tea or water as you wish. There was no in-flight entertainment, but I did not miss it. In short, very neat and complete care. I will choose Belavia again, for my next flight to Minsk.

### "working to improve its position"
Amsterdam to Minsk return with Belavia. A renewed fleet and improved service seems to be the goal, but for now, beware of the inconsistencies. As of 2017, Belavia serves hot meals on all flights more than 1.5 hours. On flight to Minsk, meal of chicken, veggies and bulgur was healthy and good; on return flight, not the case at all - 95% potatoes with congealed cheese and bacon (?) with a dry muffin. So: cross fingers and hope for the best. Aircraft are very old or very new; seat comfort varies quite a bit. However, both flights were on time and staff efficient if a bit duteous, though as another reviewer has stated, the standard working presumption seems to be that everyone speaks Russian. Online check-in didn't work for unknown reason, but kiosk check-in at Amsterdam and Minsk was easy and allowed plenty of seat options. Bus-boarding in Minsk is annoying given what appear to be empty air-bridges, but it is what it is. In short, Belavia is working to improve its position and image, but inconsistency in execution remains. However, they seem to be on the right track, which is more than can be said for some of the other flagship carriers in Europe. Interesting to see where Belavia goes with the new 5-day visa-free entry in Belarus (which is hassle-less).

### "great flying experience"
Great flying experience from Tel Aviv to Minsk with Belavia. The plane looked new and clean. The food was tasty. The staff inviting. The flights took off on time. I enjoy the flight a lot and would recommend it without hesitation. I suggest you take the negative reviews with a grain of salt.

### "worst flying experiences ever"
Astana to Amsterdam via Minsk. Flying Belavia was probably one of my worst flying experiences ever. Unfortunately I had no other choice as all flights out of Astana to Europe where fully booked. The two aircraft I travelled with were very old B737-500s. Especially the first one was outdated and probably over 30 years old and retrofitted somewhere in the 90s or so by adding an entertainment system for music only, which was broken. But nobody uses this type of IFE any more as everyone has either a phone of MP3 for personal entertainment and music. The aircraft still had ash-trays installed in the arm rests. Seats on my first flight from Astana to Minsk where terrible resulting in neck pain. Seats on the flight from Minsk to Amsterdam where soft and had good head rests, but the seat back was so thick and pitch so small that knee and leg space was very limited. Check-in staff was friendly and boarding was quick. Some of the crew members were very friendly, others were grumpy old Belarussian men. Crew assumes everyone is Belarussian, which is not very thoughtful. Drinks are fine, but the food was absolute horror. They said it was beef but I was unable to identify what kind of stuff I got. In general I would say to avoid this airline, unless Minsk is your final destination as I don't think that there are many alternatives from Western Europe except for (as far as I know) Lufthansa via Frankfurt and Austrian via Vienna.

### "very tight seat layout"
Minsk to Moscow Domodedovo. I'm a frequent traveller from Kiev to Moscow via Minsk - 4 times a month. Belavia was quite agile to adjust its schedule and offer more or less comfortable connection flights for business travellers. The fleet they operate is mostly B737 classic (+Tu-154 for those who miss Soviet times) - old and non-comfortable. Almost no difference between business and economy. Very tight seat layout (also in business). Airport service in Minsk is on average, lounge offers some local food. Cabin crew is usually polite and attentive. What really works is punctuality - most of the flights were on time, disregarding summer or winter time.

### "service onboard was awful"
Moscow to Minsk with Belavia was awful! The flight was delayed for unknown reasons almost 3 hours. The type of aircraft was changed. The plane was supposed to be a Boeing but it was a terrible and extremely old Tupolev. Service onboard the aircraft was awful. Flight attendants make a bad impression.

### "onboard service is non-existent"
Flew from Minsk to Kiev Borispol. As a frequent traveler on Belavia, I do around 5-10 flights monthly with them. My overall opinion is that they are the most primitive legacy airline I've ever used. Even downhill from low cost. All the aircraft's are ancient and have no standard seat layout. Legroom is tight. Another negative point: the onboard service is non-existent and is limited to 1 glass of water (still or carbonated - that's the choice). If you opt to buy food or drink, don't bother: they do not exist on sale. It is also a bad idea to buy so-called business class ticket. You will be seated into economy and given same glass of water. The only reasons I use them are that the schedule exactly fits my needs, there is almost no choice on routes I fly, all my flights are up to 75 minutes, and they are always on time.

### "food good and service too"
Great flight from Minsk to Tel Aviv with Belavia. The food onboard was good and service too. The plane was very clean. Only complaint is the age of the plane but this is not a big problem. I flew back from Tel Aviv to Minsk too and all aspects of the flight were very good - would recommend.

### "very nice flight"
Milan to Minsk on Belavia, and very nice flight indeed. Check in was quick. Our flight was on time both departure and arrival. The plane was new and seats very comfortable. We were offered complimentary tea and pain-au-chocolat. Cabin crew was very helpful and attentive. A huge improvement with respect to the old Belavia service.

### Belavia customer review
Belavia is one of the carrier 2 operators on this route. For 5kg of excess baggage I was not charged. Was a very old 737-500 with the smell of fuel and unwashed socks in the cabin. No leg room and uncomfortable seats. Crew talking and seemed very strict with no smiles.

### Belavia customer review
Flight from Warsaw to Minsk was on time and uneventful. Transit at Minsk was impossible because the airport has no facilities to process transit passengers. All passengers with connecting flights were herded into a hot, stuffy room for an hour, until the man in a green uniform who had the key to the door to the main Minsk terminal decided to appear. By that time, most connecting flights had departed, including my flight to Kiev. Belavia staff tried hard, spoke little English, said I would have to sleep in the airport as my passport was ineligible for a transit visa on arrival, and travel on the morning flight to Kyiv 14 hours later. Nothing offered, not even a bottle of water for the inconvenience. To be fair it was the fact that Minsk airport does not work for transit passengers that was the issue, but Belavia must be aware of this and should not sell connecting flights. I am sure Belavia is fine for point to point travel, but it (and Minsk airport) is unable to cope with connecting flights.

### Belavia customer review
Amsterdam - Minsk 23/07/2014 Minsk - Amsterdam 30/07/2014. Brand new Embraer 195 that was delivered in May 2014. Good seat pitch config 2-2. Flight packed but air hostess made everyone feel comfortable. Given a sandwich and a selection of soft drinks. Good value for money comfortable and enjoyable experience overall. Would even suggest it rivals Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines that fly to Minsk in terms of overall experience.

### Belavia customer review
I have been using Belavia airlines for almost nine years and I have never had any problems. Good service good flights always on time and most importantly staff were very kind and helpful. Representative at the airport always helping with a smile! I am recommending them for a safe and pleasant trip.

### Belavia customer review
I have flown several times with Belavia from Moscow and London to Minsk and have been impressed on every occasion. They might not be cheap from London to Minsk but they are very competitive from Moscow to Minsk. Even better if you fly on their brand new Embraer aircraft which are going to replace the aged Boeing 737s. The staff are very courteous and efficient on every flight sweets are given before take-off and usually before landing food isn't fantastic but neither is easyJet's or BA's. I have flown with Western European airlines into Minsk and the prices are sometimes cheaper if there is a sale on otherwise Belavia offers good value for money Vs. time and hassle avoided from London Gatwick. From Moscow (DME) Belavia code-share with S7 so you will always fly Belavia from DME to MSQ.

### Belavia customer review
I have flown Belavia to Prague several times. I'm pretty much satisfied. Organized check-in nice service onboard food is normal (not very tasty though). Newer airplanes are better (like smaller CRJ) some Boeings do look old and they are. Seats are comfortable enough. Captain updates you on fight conditions and timings several times during the flight and it's nice. Landings were pretty smooth.

### Belavia customer review
MSQ-KGD-MSQ economy. Flights were around the New Year and usual for this route CRJ 100/200 were replaced with larger aircraft. Minsk-Kaliningrad with Tu154m. Cabin looked newer than expected and more comfortable although the cabin design was the lowest priority apparently. The crew were polite and very helpful the inflight service decent for the 50 min flight including cold drinks coffee tea and a small chocolate. Return flight was a packed and extremely shabby B737-300 with no leg room the crew very much inferior to the previous one - rude and inattentive. The web-site and on-line check in are functional the international airport Minsk 2 is horrible with no attempts from the staff to make things easier but this is not a major problem because it is empty.

### Belavia customer review
From Amsterdam to Minsk and back. Fly this flight every second week now for a year experienced only once a small delay of half an hour. The planes are good in wintertime they use a smaller new plane. Staff are friendly and helpful. Food is not too good. They fly only 5 times per week and in the middle of the day.

### Belavia customer review
24-08-2012 Tel Aviv to Minsk on Boeing 737-300. Aircraft is very old and passenger cabin was in awful condition. One toilet was closed with 3 red tapes and a second was dirty. Meals was good for this type of airline. 2-09-2012 Minsk to Tel Aviv on another Boeing 737-300. Aircraft was old but a passenger cabin in much better condition. Toilets clean. Service more quick and efficient.

### Belavia customer review
Everyone given boiled sweets as they boarded. Business class (from London Gatwick to Tel Aviv via Minsk - same price as British Airways or El Al economy). I was also offered a fruit juice or tea/coffee and given a thick blanket and decent-sized pillow. Every business class passenger had 3 seats to themselves and was allowed to lie across all 3. Dinner served on both flights with great portions! Meals served on white fabric tablecloth with fabric napkin and stainless steel cutlery and porcelain dishes. Both flight meals delicious. Service great. Staff spoke poor English on second flight but good detailed announcements and safety demonstrations in English on both flights. On second flight captain gave detailed info on flight route and stats as the flight progressed. First plane an ex-Xiamen Boeing 737-500 in excellent condition with radios at each seat where the ash-trays used to be. Second plane a 737-300. Transfer at Minsk fine as weather delayed the first flight a bus was chartered just for me (the only LGW-TLV passenger) to take me from the transfer desk to the next flight where I was allowed to the front of the queue as a business class passenger.

### Belavia customer review
Terrible would never recommend this flight to anyone - it is not worth the low price. Stockholm to Tehran (return). Awful food no online check in there was no passport control in Minsk - a lady came and took everyone's passports! The worst thing was the return flight - some people had 30kg luggage allowance on their ticket some had 20kg. We checked in Iran and in Minsk they told us that the rule has changed and now there is no more 30kg allowance and every one must pay or else not allowed to fly! They treated us very rudely.

### Belavia customer review
AMS - MSQ return. Most flights with small 50 seat Bombardier plane. When the demand is higher you can except a slightly run down Boeing. Flight is on time airplanes clean most of the time staff mostly friendly problems I encountered were easily solved.

### Belavia customer review
WAW to MSQ. I was surprised to find my Belavia flight more comfortable than my LOT and United flights. My flight was delayed an hour but this was fine by me. The staff were nice and the food was OK.

### Belavia customer review
Warsaw - Minsk in Business. Good if slightly old-fashioned russian-style meal served on this 50 minute flight. Only alcohol availiable was congac a nice variety from Georgia. Friendly crew who seemed genuinely happy to serve. A nice experience.

### Belavia customer review
FRA-MSQ-LGW. Outbound from FRA a Tupolev 154 in quite good condition compared to Iranian 154s but still a very old type. Food service OK hot meal but nothing remarkable. Return to UK by ex-Continental 737-500 very nice flight in an empty row good meal and multiple drinks services.

### Belavia customer review
PRG-MSQ-PRG. The service was good and crew friendly. The food average but tasty aircraft B737-500 but a little tired. Both flights on time. Nothing special but no complains. Codeshared flight with Czech Airlines.

### Belavia customer review
London to Minsk to London. Service ok but nothing special. Food not very good. However if you want to go direct to Minsk from the UK this is your only choice. Not bad but could do with some competition. Expensive for the distance.
