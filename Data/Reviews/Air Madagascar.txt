### "a zero rating if we could"
My wife and I booked round trip flights to Majahanga from Tana with Air Madagascar on January 21st. Last Saturday due to the continued stringent travel restrictions in place in South Africa and Madagascar and the uncertainty the idea of well any kind of travel really during a global pandemic we sadly were forced to cancel our honeymoon. We informed the airline of our decision in writing and four days later (i.e. yesterday) we received an email (from a Gmail account no less) offering a single penalty-free flight change valid 'til January 2021 despite our expressly requesting for a refund. Which airline in this day and age doesn't have their own email domain? Real professional outfit. We let it be known immediately in a subsequent email that we didn't appreciate not-so-subtly being coerced to accept a "solution" to a problem not of our making that benefits them at our expense. We are still awaiting a response. As others have pointed out flights with this airline are a lottery. I wish we'd known this beforehand so we could've saved ourselves the headache. We'd give them a zero rating if we could. They really are that bad.

### "worst airline I have used"
Not Verified |  Antananarivo to Johannesburg. This is the worst airline I have used. The two flights I booked with them were both canceled on the day of the flight. One was canceled due to mechanical problems on the plane, only after everyone had boarded, and was replaced by another flight 12 hours later. The other an international flight to Johannesburg was canceled with no explanation. We were told that the next flight wasn’t for a full week thereafter, which would have caused us to miss our international flight back to the US. The customer service agent could only offer me a call center email address for requesting a refund. When I did so, they told me they could only process the refund through “my travel agent” — but I had booked the tickets myself, on the Internet! Canceling a flight and not refunding it is called stealing.

### "doesn't have online check in"
Booked an Air Madagascar return ticket from Nairobi to Antananarivo, operated by Kenya Airways both ways (cheaper than booking directly via Kenya Airways). Onward flight date comes and there's no check in counter for Air Madagascar at Nairobi Airport so I go to the Kenya Airways counter and attempt to check in. They have a hard time locating my name in the system but I assume they override it manually and check me in regardless since my ticket clearly indicates that I should be on the flight. Fast forward 2 days and I'm at the airport in Antananarivo for my flight back to Nairobi. Same story, no check in counter for Air Madagascar (in Madagascar!) and I go over to the Kenya Airways counter again and they can't locate my name in the system again. I go to the Air Madagascar ticketing office and they confirm that I'm on the flight. I go back to the check in counter and this back and forth happens 2 more times (going through security over and over again, everyone looking at me crazier each time) and each time, the people at the check in counter can't locate my name. Finally, the fella at the Air Madagascar ticketing office issues me a new ticket for later in the day free of charge. Nice gesture and in order for this not to happen again, I try to check in myself online.. guess what? Air Madagascar doesn't have an online check in feature on their website! I'm writing this as I wait for my second flight, wondering whether I'll have to go through this ordeal again later. I recommend just booking with Kenya Airways directly.

### "information about delay was bad"
Not Verified |  Antananarivo to Majunga. Flight was operated by EWA; two hours late and information about the delay was bad; aircraft was a little bit old; friendly FA; some refreshments served. Fare a little bit high.

### "friendly flight attendants"
Not Verified |  Tuléar to Antananarivo. Quick Check-in; on time; plane a bit old; refreshments and a snack served; friendly flight attendants. The fare was somehow high, but this is Madagascar. You shouldn't come here if you are pampered by low-cost carriers;

### "operated by Air Tsaradia"
Antsiranana to Sambava. Flight was booked in Air Madagascar website; flight was operated by Air Tsaradia, the new domestic carrier. Check-in quite fast; not too serious about little overweight luggage and cabin luggage; due to the short flight-time, no refreshments, fare a little bit expensive compared to flight-time; alternative would have been to travel 12h on very bad road.

### "forthcoming with meals and accommodation"
Flew Sainte Marie to Antananarivo with Air Madagascar. Online, this looks to be an airline of last resort, but I found myself requiring their services at the end of a holiday in Madagascar. I wasn't totally surprised when my flight was cancelled, and the replacement flight the next day ran 2 hours late. To their credit, they were very forthcoming with meals and accommodation while we were stranded.

### "truly the worst airline"
Antananarivo to Fort Dauphin. I have flown multiple times on domestic flights with Air Madagascar over the past few years. They are truly the worst airline I have ever had the misfortune of flying with. Delays, cancellations, bad customer service, dirty planes, no in-flight refreshments, hugely over-priced. In one instance I chose to travel for over 50 hours on a public bus to reach my destination, rather than give any more money to them and I would probably do that again after yet another delay on my most recent flight.

### "cancelled without notice"
Paris to Antananarivo return. Never use this airline if you plan on getting home on time. Our homeflight was cancelled without notice. It took a full extra day to get home - we have filed a complaint and sought compensation, and after 7 consecutive emails, we recieved only one short response from air Madagascar we got no compensation at all.

### "flights were on time"
Antananarivo to Fort Dauphin via Morondava and no notable issues with Air Madagascar service. Easy website to navigate and book. All flights were on time with pleasant crew and ground service as well. Snacks on outward flights only, and return flight had a fruit danish and coffee only (100 minute flight). Nice, very nice and bright interior on the ATR 72 (first time I'd flown this aircraft). But - and this is a well known issue for Air Madagascar - they did move the departure time up for my return flight to Tana, From 940 am to 640am. Grrr. At least they emailed me and informed my hotel the afternoon before. Note though: domestic flying is cheaper if you fly into Madagascar with them. I didn't, given their spotty record and flying from Canada to Madagascar on a tight time line.

### "warned about Air Madagascar"
Antananarivo to Paris. It was my mistake, I had been warned about Air Madagascar. But my lovely agency in London felt that it would be fine. The flight out had no inflight entertainment (they never bothered with the headsets), the flight back was actually 3 cancelled flights -I had only been delayed 14 hours some had been waiting for 2 days. So nearly 12 hours, no inflight entertainment, no hot water, so no tea or coffee. We didn't see a soul for 8 hours. I have been working in Madagascar so have had a few flights. On this trip one flight was brought forward 5 hours and then took off 30 mins early. I feel sorry for the staff, they do their best, but the management of this airline reflects the government they just don't care about the people / customers.

### "airline is a disaster"
Mauritius to Antananarivo. We have booked five flights with Air Madagsacar. None of them took place or was in time. Flights have either been cancelled within 12 hrs of departure or after waiting at the airport for hours. Staff at the airport is either unwilling or stupid - or both. This airline is a disaster!

### "the most useless airline"
If you have the time and funds not to travel Air Madagascar then this will always be your best option. It is without doubt the most useless airline. Having lived in Madagascar for two years I would always take the option of hiring a car and going over land if financially feasible/the time is available. The few flights I have taken with the airline have always been delayed, even once as we were on the plane we then had to disembark and were told that the flight would go sometime the next day. It is very common for flights to be cancelled, I've even had friends whose flights have been turned out mid-flight and returned to their original destination. Also expect your bags to be lost as well. Make sure that you check on your flight frequently days before your flight because it is no new phenomena for them to pull your flight forward and not notify you. This has happened to several friends. Cabin staff have typically always been very nice though. Ground staff are slow and vacant. Don't expect anything to be done on time or if it is expect to be treated as though you are seriously putting someone out.

### "wouldn't recommend to fly them"
We flew Air Madagascar from Paris to Antananarivo return in economy class in November 2015. Our initial flight from Paris was cancelled without any notification. After checking my booking online (it always worth checking if you fly with Air Madagascar) we realised that we were supposed to fly 3 days later, although Air Madagascar didn't ask if this would be suitable for us. We tried to contact them by email, phone and we even went to the customer service desk in Charles de Gaulle Airport - no one was there to help us. Their customer service doesn't exist. After few days of attempts our tour operator in Madagascar was lucky to get in touch with them locally. We asked at least to move our return flight so we can stay in Madagascar as many days as planned. We were not surprised when our return flight to Paris was moved to the following day. We contacted the airline on the day of the flight to check and they couldn't confirm the exact date and time of the departure. They didn't offer accommodation. So as a result, we had to completely reschedule our tour including all hotels etc. ; we missed 2 connection flights from London to Paris return (we live in London). We also had one domestic flight with this airline to Morondava. This flight was also cancelled and then rescheduled the night before the flight. Local people in Madagascar called this airline Air Maybe. I wouldn't recommend anyone to fly with Air Madagascar. The tickets are cheaper than other with airlines, but as a result it will cost you much more than were planning to spend.

### Air Madagascar customer review
Air Madagascar cancelled the initial flight from Bangkok and moved it to the following day without warning or explanation. They did provide accommodation and the flight was ok. Our next flight with Air Madagascar was then a domestic one, a week later, Antananarivo to Sante Marie. This was overpriced at 500 euro pp for a one hour flight. Without any warning the flight was moved to 4 hours earlier. Air Madagascar acknowledged that we confirmed our flight 24 hours prior and that they provided no warning of the change and no replacement flight. Due to the cancellation of this flight our return flight booking to Bangkok was wiped from their system without warning. We had to frantically arrange a ticket with minutes to spare. 3 flights with Air Madagascar  and 3 stressful and very poor experiences

I flew BKK-TNR-BKK in business class in May 2015. Overall the 8 hr flight is good and on-time (a bit earlier than scheduled). On TNR-BKK the flight stopped in Bangkok before going to Guangzhou. A340 was used on this route. Staff are very nice the facilities on board like toilet entertainment and food and beverages could be compared to business class on other airlines. Inflight entertainment - no flying map no music no movie.

I flew Economy Paris-Tana Tana-Antsiranana Antsiranana-Tana Tana-Paris in Sept and Oct 2014. Local flights were on 737 nothing special (neither bad nor good) the intercontinental flight was on an old 340. The fittings were old but ok seating and food ok as well in-flight entertainment a little inferior to Air France (smaller screen not as many choices) but then again AF also does not use their newest equipment on this route so that the difference is not this big. Two of the four flights were delayed by several hours one of which was my return flight on Oct 6 to Paris which was delayed by 3.5 hours. This may become a real problem for anybody requiring a connecting flight as AirMad has no code-share partners in Europe with whom one could book a combined ticket. Hence it cost me about 350 Euro to change the reservation for my AF connecting flight (fortunately it could be changed) and Air Madagascar is not willing to reimburse me referring to the conditions of sale (even though AirMad told me differently in Tana when it became clear that the delay would cause me to miss my connecting flight in Paris). Hence people not living near Paris or Marseille should take this risk into account (after all my so far longest delay on an AirMad flight was 13 hours in 2010 hence one should plan on long transfer times to be on the sure side). I would not recommend it.

### Air Madagascar customer review
Flew from Toliara to Tana. What to say about Air Madagascar - the airline usually runs on Malagasy time and this was no exception. Flight was due to leave at 18.25. By 19.00 no plane had turned up and there was absolutely nobody in the terminal with any kind of information. There are screens in the terminal but as there is only 1 flight per day they are of little use. Fortunately TLE has a fairly modern terminal (for Madagascar) and a number of places to buy drinks. 8pm came and went then 9pm still no plane and it's getting dark. Eventually at about half past 9 three guys arrived in a jeep proceeded to drive down the runway setting up a series of cones with lights on top. The first we knew anything was happening was when a plane appeared on the runway taxied up to the terminal and unloaded some passengers. We were then allowed out onto the tarmac and up the steps to the plane. Plane was a fairly modern 737 seats were reasonably comfortable staff were very friendly and as the plane was only half full the flight was one of the most pleasant I have had on AirMad. Flying with AirMad is always an experience.

We have just returned from Johannesburg via Antananarivo to Nosy Be on air Madagascar. All of our flights were on time. We found the airline to be extremely reliable the planes in good condition the staff extremely efficient and friendly. We shall certainly recommend Air Madagascar to all of our friends travelling to Madagascar.

### Air Madagascar customer review
CDG-TNR-CDG B767 TNR-NOS B737 NOS-TNR-TMM ATR 72 TMM-TNR Twin Otter. The seating on the B767 is uncomfortable. Entertainment poor and toilets not very clean. Positive points the FAs and food. A big positive point to the schedule - by leaving CDG at the end of the day you don't waste the next one not withstanding the 10hours flight. Domestic flights were nice and acceptable. However on the leg NOS-TNR I experienced a 5 hours delay (quite usual).

### Air Madagascar customer review
We used Air Madagascar for four internal flights. All four were reasonably on time (max delay about 45 mins). Cabin staff friendly and good complimentary snack and newspaper on each flight. Be prepared for very rapid braking at fort Dauphin (short runway)

Flew Air Madagascar frequently on a month-long trip from Canada over Christmas. International routing CDG-TNR-CDG. Also flew TNR-Morondava and back TNR-Diego Diego-NosyBe NosyBe-TNR TNR-SainteMarie and back. Across these flights I experienced their B767 on the international route the B737 on the flight to Diego and ATR72s on the other domestic routes. Overall I enjoyed the airline. The 767 does have a tired interior and I would certainly prefer to have preassigned seating. Flight attendants were friendly on all flights but English was not good so I'm not sure how I would have managed if my wife wasn't with me to translate from French and Malagasy into English. All of our flights left on time but I couldn't understand why we were asked to arrive so early for these small flights. My biggest complaint is with the airports in Madagascar not the airline. Seating is very limited and if you can find it it is most uncomfortable. Found the airport in Morondava to be surprisingly the best of the above locations and the airport in Diego is just plain awful. I did find it difficult to deal with Air Madagascar when booking my tickets from Canada. You can't deal directly with the airline but rather their North American agent Sita World Travel and I found they're agents friendly but not all that smart and very slow to answer e-mails. Simple questions like finding out flight availability and pricing seemed to be a big task. I would prefer an online reservation similar to that offered by other major airlines.

### Air Madagascar customer review
CDG-TNR-FDP-TNR-CDG The outbound flight was fine but CDG was awful. The queues at check in were a bit long but after an hour we were checked in. The food was nice tea and coffee were served often along with a choice of soft drinks. The seats were quite cramped but there was just enough legroom. The choice of films were not up to much but the music channels were fine with some good Malagasy music in there as well. The aircraft was a 767-300. Flying from Tana (Antananarivo) to Fort Dauphin was an experience. We had to wait for 3 hours at the airport being served coffee with horrible sweetened condensed milk and being handed week old newspapers with payment demanded. We checked in all right though. The plane was an old second generation 737 with no allocated seating. The announcements were in Malagasy and French and some sort of inconprehensible English which just sounded like the air hostess reading some English off a card. Almost no inflight service just a drink of orange juice. Fort Dauphin Airport is interesting no luggage belts so your bag number is shouted out and you have to hand them your ticket to reclaim. The return trip was much the same as the first. At TNR we were delayed for 2 hours for some technical fault which seemed to make no sense whatsoever. It was claimed that Engine number 3 had some sort of problem but there are 2 engines on a 767. As neither of the engines were started when we got on the plane the airconditioners weren't working. There are no vents above your head on this 767 either. Some people fainted as we waited for 2 hours on this sweltering plane before we departed. We missed our connection at CDG too. In the end the flight was ok good for third world but bad for everything else.

### Air Madagascar customer review
MXP-NOS (Malpensa-Nosi Be) return in Economy. The Y fare is good Business is expensive with no airmiles in any alliance so opted for Y class. Outbound leg on time (767) flight completely full seat backs a little thin but reasonably comfortable (exit or bulkhead rows 11 18 19 and 20 are best for legroom). FA's smiling speak good French. Food and wine OK soft drink selection limited and they ran out of beer quickly. Movies surprisingly up to date (In Her Shoes etc) but dubbed in French or Italian both of which I speak but would have still preferred the original version. No PTV but ceiling screens every 8-10 rows. Landed in NOS on time huge queues for visa-on-arrival in a tiny stifling airport. Take my advice and obtain a visa beforehand you will breeze through immigration. Return leg delayed by 5 hours although I had confirmed the day before and had supplied a contact phone No I arrived at an empty NOS airport at 7am for a 9am flight to be greeted by a cleaning lady and told that the flight would leave after 12 noon. My friend and I spent 3 hours in a small quaint cafe across the street from the terminal eating spaghetti and drinking Malagasy beer overall an interesting way to spend time! At 10am some airport personnel started to arrive apparently the plane had had engine trouble in Antananarivo hence the delay. Check-in began at 11.00 we managed to check-in among the first but long Italian queue in a tiny airport which cannot really handle such passenger numbers. The 767 left at 2pm many empty seats on this leg so we could spread out a bit OK inflight catering 2 full meals better drinks selection. Memorable daytime flight over Africa with fantastic views of Kilimanjaro and the Rift Valley.

### Air Madagascar customer review
BKK-TNR. This relatively new service is performed by leased B767. The layout is overwhelmingly economy (in a 2-3-2 configuration) with very modest seat pitch but the flight we got was only about 60% full. Exit row seats 18ABFG and 19 ABFG give a good deal of extra legroom with row 18 preferred due to row 19’s proximity to the lavatories (which seemed to get a lot of use in our flight!). However none of these exit row seats recline. 20 C and E may have a bit more stretch room also. Service is good but meals and entertainment are somewhat from a previous era with one meal of a sandwich and some strange tasting orange juice and with one screen for every 8 rows or so. On approach to landing an interesting looking video of Madagascar was shown but unfortunately only with a French soundtrack and quite poor audio at that.

### Air Madagascar customer review
MXP-NOS-MXP Y-Class. Air Madagascar features quite old aircraft (B767) but clean. FA's attentive to passengers' needs polite and ready to offer you a smile. Tasty food but poor entertainment program (no PTVs). Very punctual flights on both legs. Nice amenities were given on board.

### Air Madagascar customer review
My recent experience shows Air Madagascar to have very poor customer service. I was downgraded from business to economy 2 minutes before boarding they said because business was full. However when we boarded business was less than half full. I asked to be moved to business since I had already paid for it. However they told me it was to late and against the procedures. Why have stewards on the flight if they can't make simple decisions especially if the airline has clearly made a mistake. I feel cheated by the airline.

### Air Madagascar customer review
Air Madagascar which has a dense domestic network and reasonable regional links has at this time only one intercontinental route Paris - Antananarivo and one aircraft to fly the route a Boeing 767-300 Extended Range which comes from Air Canada and is fitted with the current AC Business Class long range seat a six abreast 66 inch pitch recliner with extendable foot rest. Not quite a bed but an extremely comfortable arrangement with at least 160 degrees recline and almost horizontal leg support. This is superior to any competing business class seat in the region. The lumbar support is deactivated and mostly stuck in the "hard" position a minor inconvenience as is the availability of only 1 toilet in business class sometimes insufficient for a 24 seat cabin plus use by the crew. On the other hand when was the last time you found real cloth lemon grass scented napkins in the lavatory reminiscent of another age? Food and beverage service are of a high standard not quite the F/C service of top long range airlines but well above normal intercontinental business class. DVDs are provided with a limited choice of films. Service by the crew was always attentive polite and going the extra mile. Punctuality was perfect to the minute on both legs of the round trip. Although there is only one aircraft serving the route scheduling provides for extended periods to catch up with delays before the next flight. Altogether a very enjoyable experience definitely superior to the competition's product.
