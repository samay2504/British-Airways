### "the worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Icelandair has got to be the worst airline ever! First their kiosks weren’t working and I took for ever to check our bags because they wouldn’t print our boarding passes. Then on plane there was a may functioning light and we had to deboard, waited for over an hour for them to tell us the flight is canceled. They neglected to tell us where to get our bags and their customer Services were totally useless. They gave us a 200 dollar voucher they didn’t cover our families room making us waste money. We just came back to fly another flight and they just pushed it back another hour. There is no one manning Icelandair in the airport and is a disgrace of an airline.

### "Absolutely wonderful flight"
Not Verified |  Reykjavik to Akureyri. I have never been on a friendlier serviced aircraft than this! Absolutely wonderful flight, only 35 minutes, and quite a unique experience on a propeller plane. Absolutely love the onboard "travel journal" where you can read other passengers adventures and write your own in, very sweet! Would love to fly with them again next time I'm in Iceland!

### "really enjoyed the flight"
Egilsstadir to Reykjavík. Check in was a breeze. Waiting area very clean. Boarding was very easy just showing ticket and photo ID. It was a 45 minute flight. They served tea or coffee with a chocolate. I really enjoyed the flight as I did not want to travel by road again. I will fly them again.
