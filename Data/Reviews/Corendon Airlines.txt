### “no customer service at all”
Not Verified | This airline gives a new meaning to 'cheap' in cheap airlines. If you are lucky and you are processed without anything out of ordinary you may be lucky but the minute something goes wrong there is no willingness or effort to assist you. My cabin luggage was taken out of the plane by another passenger by mistake. They realized it before leaving the airport (Gatwick) and left my bag somewhere at lost luggage. All advice I can get from Corendon now is to go to the airport and find it. Anyone who knows how big Gatwick is would understand how useless and patronising this sounds. So no customer service at all. Would never use this airline again.

### "do not recommend"
Terrible airline, do not recommend. They are running this scam when you try to check in online and got some random error and message like (Do not worry, we can't check-in online - just go to the counter and check-in there for free). And when you go to the counter bef0re your flight you are forced to pay 10EUR per person if you don't want to miss your flight and showing photos of this error on site. After the flight we filed an official complaint on their site providing receipt with additional charges and this was just closed without any explanation month later. So if you don't want to be charged for their faults, don't fly with this company.

### "Simply the worst company"
Not Verified |   On the website during check-in, an inscription appeared that online check-in was not available for this flight, however, they forced me to go through it at the airport for a fee, and customer service, even with providing a screenshot of the error on the website, said that it was my fault that I didn’t think to sort it out through their support team! In addition, after the operation with 2 children, I was deprived of the assistance that the airline was obliged to provide, although I provided all the documents, they did not even help me lift the stroller onto the bus. And then they changed the plane for us because this one was faulty and we waited an hour and a half for a transfer. Simply the worst company!

### "Such a terrible airline"
Such a terrible airline. First of all, staff on the plane were rude. My husband bought coffee. Staff lady gave him coffee with a lid not being closed properly so my husband spilled hot coffee on himslef! And then she dares to tell him to be careful! Secondly, they damaged our suitcase. Scratches all-over and a missing wheel. Thirdly, customer service is just beyond. For our damaged suitcase (which is extra large, sturdy, hard plastic, 4 wheels) they offered only £25! I provided them my bank statement with the proof of price paid but they do not accept such proof! They keep ignoring my questions. And it is so difficult to chat with them as their level of English is so poor. I keep emailing them since May 2023 but they only say the same thing and keep ignoring my questions.

### "No service at all"
Not Verified |  When we bought the ticket, we had a good flight time home and that was one of the reasons why we decided on that flight. Even before the day of departure Corendon Dutch Airlines changed the flight time two times till the worst (arriving in CPH in the middle of the night, which was extremely hard for my 83 years old dad and which forced the rest of us to take another day off and forced us to change the parking reservation). On the day of the departure we arrived at the airport (Gazipaza) and when we were in the check in queue Corendon Dutch Airlines cancelled the flight. It was nearly midnight. No one knew when we could go home and the level of information was very inadequate. We went into buses. The bus driver didn’t know where to take us and drove us around the area for an hour before he found the right hotel (it was only a 20 minutes drive). It was the most lousy hotel ever! So dirty. No light in the corridor. My sister and her husbands room had wet towels and make up on the pillow. And the door was smashed by a closed fist. My niece got harassed in the elevator by the baggage boy. It was a nightmare! The delay ended up to be over 12 hours. And Corendon makes it so difficult to claim a compensation! So unethical! No service at all.

### "I found them to be very good"
Not Verified |  Second time flown with Corendon Airlines this summer. I found them to be very good. Call center couldn't have been anymore helpful even calling back. Check at online was to be fair not plain sailing but got there eventually. The agent at AYT was very pleasant. The majority of the operating crew were fantastic being very friendly and professional. They were very well presented obviously complying with high uniform standards as they should. Unfortunately they were let down by a miserable "cabin chief". His attitude made it clear he'd rather be somewhere anywhere else other than on that aircraft. Had the front galley curtain stretched as tight as possible over the whole galley area denying access to the front toilet from the cabin. Not professional.

### "forced to pay 10 Euros each"
Not Verified |  We chose the airline because of the price. At the counter for check-in we were forced to pay 10 Euros each. For 4 hours no drink and food. The cabin was so small flight attendants wanted us to sit with our luggage. We refused we had to beg them to create space coz other people choose to pack their luggage in our compartment, it was annoying. I guess that's what we get 4 using a cheaper airline.

### "didn't care to solve the problem"
Terrible attitude from the flight attendant. They were so reckless and didn't care to solve the problem that occurred during the boarding. They didn't help the passengers and they didn't organize the passengers when they were trying to find their seats. A man was yelling at everyone although he was not following the rules and the crew didn't do anything about it.

### "wouldn't travel with this company again"
I wouldn't travel with this company again, nothing positive from check in to getting on the plane everything sucks. When it came time to pick up my luggage it came broken and without the lock so I'm still struggling more until I reach my destination. Δεν θα ταξίδευα ξανά με αυτήν την εταιρεία τίποτα θετικό. από το check in μέχρι μέσα στο αεροπλάνο όλα χάλια. και όταν ήρθε η ώρα να παραλάβω την αποσκευη μου ήρθε σπασμένη και χωρίς το ροδακι με αποτέλεσμα να ταλαιπωρηθω ακόμα περισσότερο μέχρι να φτάσω στον προορισμό μου.

### "Recommend to anyone!"
There are a lot of negative reviews for this airlines but for a budget airline what do these reviewers expect? Premium airline service? They have obviously never flown on EasyJet or Ryanair to make a comparison! Flew to Turkey from Manchester and was quite impressed by their check-in, service and legroom on the 737 plane. Recommend to anyone!

### "never been on such an awful flight"
My husband and I have just had the misfortune to fly with this airline. We booked with Thomas Cook and this was the airline they choose to use and we had already paid our deposit before we realised. I have never been on such an awful flight ever! We were rammed in like sardines, my husband who is average height just about had his knees under his chin. The seats were narrow too so you became well acquainted with your neighbour. The aircraft was far too hot and the air conditioning was totally inadequate. There was no in-flight entertainment, not even the usual booklet in the seat pockets. Menus of the food they were selling were not available so the in-flight service took forever which inconvenienced anyone wanting to use one of the two toilets aboard. It was packed with children, I have never known so many children on a flight given it was not school holidays, most of who screamed and cried for all four and half hours. The adults weren’t much better as they too seemed to have no volume control either. The staff made no effort to ask parents to control their children or to assist with suggestions of how distract them or ease their distress. I have flown with football fans after a long delay at Heathrow and that was far less noisy. We thought the flight out was maybe just bad luck, however the return flight was just as awful. One minor plus, we had none of the much mentioned problems with the online check-in.

### "What a terrible airline"
What a terrible airline. Never again. 10 times worse than Ryanair. We had booked a direct flight from Hannover to Fuerteventura. A week before the flight was moved forward by two hours because the plane flew to Gran Canaria before to drop people off there and for the return flight to Hanover to pick up people again. A four and a half hour flight became a seven hour flight. Unbelievably badly organized. The staff was very unfriendly and did not speak English very well. On the return flight then the same. Only that we had no stopover but as the last then in Fuerteventura have boarded. Our reserved seats were occupied and we could not sit together as a family and sat completely on different seats. My father had specially booked an aisle seat so he could stretch his operated leg. But he had to sit in the middle. A total chaos because no one sat on his booked seats. Also here the crew spoke even worse English than on the outbound flight. German spoke no one from the crew, which was a real problem for the 90% over 60 year old people. This airline, never again. They should be revoked the license.

### "cancellations not being refunded"
Not Verified | Flight on 26.06.2022 Manchester to Dalaman delayed by 3.5 hours. Claimed for compensation on the 5.07.2022. 8 weeks later I get a message back saying they have agreed to pay compensation. It will arrive in 6-8 weeks, quite why it takes this long when the likes of EasyJet/Ryanair do it in 14 days is beyond me. Anyway. It is now the first week of February, a full 7 months since my holiday, and the money has still not been paid. There are countless reviews of this company stating the same thing, cancellations not being refunded after over 6 months etc. There is no recourse to do anything over the phone they just fob you off, and they completely ignore online messaging even though you can see they have read them. I have been to CAA who are now awaiting a response, do not use this airline if you can't afford to lose this money as they WILL NOT compensate you to allow you to get the money back to book elsewhere. Absolute joke of a company. I get a company can be busy and things can take longer than normal, but 7 months for an 800 euro payment? Come on.

### "still waiting for a resolution"
Over 8 months since Corendon lost my suitcase and I'm still waiting for a resolution. I accepted their offer of payment 12 weeks ago and they stated it would be received in 8-10 weeks. Still no sign of payment and their customer services are not interested in helping. A quick search on Twitter shows I'm not the only one currently in this position with numerous people complaining of similar issues in receiving the compensation they are entitled to. They seem to be trying to increase their offering from UK airports this year but can't even resolve their issues from last year. Regardless of how they cheap they may be it's not worth risking flying with them. If you do encounter problems and need to contact them (which it seems many have) you will be left frustrated and most likely out of pocket

### "cancelled two days before departure"
Our flight was cancelled two days before departure. They claimed this was due to the airport. In fact, the flight was operated, just we were not allowed on board. They said they would offer compensation but have not paid in months!

### "about 7 hours on the plane instead of 4"
My wife and I had booked a direct flight from Cologne to Tenerife on Corendon Airlines. A few weeks before the flight, we were informed that the departure time was moved forward from 10:00h to 07:20h, because the flight had been merged with the one to Gran Canaria and therefore now had a stopover there, with a similar arrival time. So we had to book a hotel near the airport at our own expense to be able to be there at the earlier time. Corendon refused compensation for this upon request. On the day of departure, it then became clear that due to the merging of the two flights without adjusting the pre-reserved seats, some seats were now double-booked when boarding at the gate - the clarification of this error, for which Corendon is responsible, caused about 90 minutes of delay. Thus, we had a total of about 7 hours on the plane instead of 4, without the airline offering passengers at least one free drink. We had booked the premium fare for a significant extra charge, which according to the website includes a meal - one would assume it would be something to eat and a drink. But in fact you only get one of each and have to pay for the other! Then on the return trip, there was no Priority or Bag Drop desk available, even though we booked and paid for it. Our online check in done the day before was deleted and we got different seats at the counter than reserved, apparently still due to double assigned seats due to the merging of flights. Conclusion: Corendon offers a direct flight with a pleasant departure time as a loss leader, but then, when the load factor is too low, combines two flights, which results in both a significantly longer travel time and an unfavorable departure time. Paid and booked additional services are not provided. We are happy to forgo another flight with this airline.

### "Non-existent customer service"
Flight cancelled 2 hours after planned take off. No replacement flight, no hotel provided, no vouchers. No compensation or refund after 4 months of complaints. Non-existent customer service. Do not fly with this airline under any circumstances, you will be left in debt.

### "no information regarding the delay"
Flight was late for over three hours, no information regarding the delay until I arrived at the gate. Missed my second flight due to the delay. They even rejected the compensation claim, disgrace, never again.

### "promised a refund within 14 days"
Not Verified |  I booked our family holiday return flight for 9 passengers with Corendon Airlines in May for £3024. We were due to fly on 30th October. They cancelled the flight 30th August and promised a refund within 14 days. Despite several phone calls the refund has not arrived. At short notice it was very difficult to find an alternative flight. The only flight available is more than twice the price because it is so close to departure and also it isn't a direct flight. I can't afford to book this until I get the refund. So our whole holiday is now at risk and our insurance will not cover our losses.

### "Totally unreliable company"
Avoid at all costs. This company takes your money then cancels your flights one leg at a time. Do not book with Corendon Airlines. Our flight in November has just been cancelled after cancellations of our flights in May. Totally unreliable company

### "urge everyone to avoid Corendon"
Terrible airline for blanket cancellations across all UK airports for months of Sept and Oct. No apology and no offer of automatic and speedy refund. An open ticket is offered to be used within 7 days of original flight - which is impossible when all flights have been cancelled by this airline. I urge everyone to avoid Corendon and book with a better airline who have an app that works, respond to messages and actually answer their phones.

### "Do not, you've been warned"
Bad service and rip-off. First please note, that when flying Corendon everything thinkable will be charged surplus. Not doing online self check-in will cost an extra 10EUR p.p. Any additional luggage, other than Cabin-luggage, is charged surplus (1X20kg = 60EUR). A coffee, inflight, would have cost me 3 EUR surplus. Further, the "flight-information" was not understandable - but at least deafening. Conclusion: Do not, you've been warned.

### "crew more interested in standing around chatting"
Old, cramped and dirty aircraft (OM-FEX), parts of the inner cablin lining detached. Lack of on-line check in meant we had to suffer the painfully slow check in at the airport The chaotic boarding delayed our departure, crew more interested in standing around chatting than getting passengers to their seats. In-flight service continued the slow theme, didn't get to us in row 18 until 2 and a half hours into a 4 hour flight. No card machines which meant the crew having to do manual currency conversions, it does without saying they lacked change too. Crew didn't seem to know what they had to sell of where it was in the trolley, every request seemed to require searching every drawer or having a conference with colleagues. Clearly drunk passengers allowed to board and then fall asleep across 3 seats with their feet in the aisle, kids fighting and climbing over the back of seats, throwing water at each other, banging the windows - not a word from the crew. Not a flight I would like to experience again.

### "Never again!"
Never again! We had a vacation in Kemer and booked the back-flight from Corendon Airlines based on a very comfortable departure time of 2:50 p.m. On the 1st day of our vacation we were informed that departure time has been changed to 9:30 a.m. Meaning we are to lose half a day at the sea and must leave the hotel at ca. 5:00 a.m. instead of a much more comfortable 10:00 a.m. Departure day - we arrived at Antalya airport at 6:30 a.m. and were informed at the check-in desk that flight is delayed to 1:00 p.m. Could not they inform us a bit earlier? We had to wait at the airport for 5 hours and no compensation - no lounge, nothing... Our 6yo daughter was exhausted from waiting so long. The airplane was very old and dirty, the food and drinks are only paid for, even no free water. The seat of my wife was with a broken armrest. The entertainment media system was deactivated.

### "highly recommended not to use"
Never use this airline. The flight programmed at 3 pm was postponed twice without information to finally be canceled. They send you to a hotel with, no rooms available, without any information when a flight would be available. I had to work and travel the day after. I lost everything This airline is the highly recommended not to use, never, even if price is very low.

### "ticket includes pet in the cabin"
The worst airline that I ever met. They sold me ticket includes pet in the cabin. Although I checked several times before flight, the airport didn't accept us. They didn't solve our problem. Even if they didn't refund my money back. They are far away from professionality I cancelled my whole program. I have waited more than 5 hours at airport without flying.

### "Zero communication from Corendon"
I booked my holiday through Travel Republic to travel on 21st July at 19.40 with Corendon Airlines. The flight was cancelled. Zero communication from Corendon or Travel Republic. Check in desk were clueless and fobbed us off to Jet2. No notifications on airport screens, as if the flight 'didn't exist'. Only after phoning Corendon was I informed the flight was cancelled. Hotel stay in Manchester airport and 2 x Jet2 flights for 22/7 at 16.30, all out of my pocket. First and last time booking with Travel Republic and apparently never flying with Corendon Airlines. Furious. Wanted to give a zero review but not allowed. My holiday ruined? Deserves a zero.

### "level of service is very good"
I flew the route Antalya to Frankfurt and was surprised by the good service by the Cabin crew and attention to details. Their level of service is very good but I hope they improve on their inflight meals and presentation. Other than that competent pilots and clean planes.

### "would use this airline in the future again"
Very nice guys. Much better than my other flights. Staff in the plane were friendly and helpful. Price is reasonable. I would use this airline in the future again.

### "I think it's a good airline"
I flew with Corendon Airlines on February 2022 from Nuremberg to Fuerteventura. I think it's a good airline without major disadvantages. The staff was friendly, I was able to buy good food on the board and everything was more or less good. The flight was on time. The plane is not new, but good. I would only recommend to fix all the fans above the passenger, on the way back it was not possible to close it. But all the rest is good.

### "it is just better to avoid"
Corendon Airlines should be avoided. Its services are poor even in the low-cost segment. I got nice deals, so I flew 4 times with them recently. One flight was delayed by 2.5 hrs due to technical failures, the other one was delayed by an hour due to late boarding start. The other two were delayed by 30 mins, which seems to be a standard for Corendon. Nobody really cares about that. They have online check-in for only a handful of airports and you need to be early to check-in personally with all the others. Their website is old, unintuitive and you cannot even access your generated boarding pass after online check-in closes. Onboard you are not allowed to use headphones or mobile phone for takeoff/landing, which is a bit inconvenient. If you get a really good deal, it is manageable to fly with them, in all the other cases, it is just better to avoid.

### "crew was very nice"
Not Verified |  Got a bargain flight. Paid for all the extras I required. Was told that next time I would not need to pay for an add-on as it was included already in the other one bought. BSL based crew was very nice and found meal choice on first flight of day very good. No sandwich but many warm and snack options. Only drawback-no online check-in Resulting in having to be at the airport very early.

### "Not recommended"
Not recommended. Online Check in is mandatory, but did not work on the German website. Only the UK Website worked. Bad service, stressed crew, we felt unsafe.

### "flight would have been exactly the same without any stewardesses on board"
This was the worst service I’ve ever experienced on any flight in my whole life. 4.5 hours over dinner time and there's not even a small beverage included. Not to mention food. We received a menu card at the beginning of the flight with horrendous prices. When I asked to pay by card, there was no opportunity given - cash only, which wasn’t mentioned before and we had no more cash with us. So we arrived starving and dying of thirst. The only positive thing to mention is the safe take-off and landing - thanks to the pilot. But the flight would have been exactly the same without any stewardesses on board, because throughout the flight they were barely visible and not very friendly with questions and problems. I would not recommend this airline to anyone.

### " first and last flights with this company"
I have been flown Corendon Airlines twice, Germany/Turkey rt. This trip to Germany was not very different from the trip to Turkey. When arriving at the airport, they had delayed the plane one hour. Of course the delayed doubled before we took off. My opinion is that this company use twice the time on every task, compared to other airlines. When they started boarding, there was a lot of supervisors with their walkie talkies on max volume, trying to divide the passengers into two lines, but no system about their work, like letting the passenger sitting in the back of the plane enter first. The boarding was very slow, never seen such long lines, to get into the plane. The flight itself was like any other flight. After arriving in Dusseldorf, through imigration went very fast, then it was the luggage, so slow delivery. I lost my onward connection. It seems like they are happy with their performance, and that delays are something the passengers must calculate with, when travelling with Corendon air. This was my two first and last flights with this company.

### "not use this airline again"
Not Verified |  Hamburg to Antalya. A few days before departure, a mail come with a new schedule, 1.h35 min later. That resulted in a longer wait in Hamburg Airport, since i flew into Hamburg earlier that day. Time for the new departure time, and no plane at the gate. Further delay, after 3 hours delay totally, we were on our way. Instead of arriving in Antalya, midnight we landed almost 3 am. The service trolley came , but i think people had bought much on their way to Hamburg, we could choose between noodles and noodles. The plane looked not that old, and it have those new very thin seats. The pitch was ok, the knees were not pressed into the seat in the row in front. But it seems like they are not able to, or the task of getting the planes on time, its not their priority. I will not use this airline again.

### "cheap, but that's it"
Not Verified |  Las Palmas to Nurnberg. We flew Corendon for the first time and never again! The flight took 4.5 hours and you get nothing at all, so take everything from home or buy at the airport. We changed our departure time during the holiday so we had to pay extra money to park our car. Communication with Corendon, horror and horror! They are cheap, but that's it.

### "I had a bad experience"
Hurghada to Hamburg. I had a bad experience with Corendon Airlines. They changed the time of the return flight 2 hours earlier, and they actually sent an email, but it went to the spam inbox! so I missed the flight and I booked with them aslo the other day.. The problem is that the flight cordinator in the airport wasn't helpful and simply said it's my fault and left. The flight itself was ok in comparison with the price.

### "have absolutely no complaints"
Izmir to Munich. I flew 9th November 2019 first time with this airline. I have absolutely no complaints to make. It's a bargain airline and it was 100% worth the cost. Seat was comfortable and plane was clean. Everything was as good as I could have wanted. I will use again.

### "never recommend this airline"
Frankfurt to Banjul, Our flight got cancelled and the airline didn't provide any help and it took two days till we were back home. The airline should seriously think about their service level and how they treat their customers. It was awful. I would never recommend this airline!

### "luggage costs me 140 Euro"
Antalya to Nürnberg. Pure Rip-off. I booked my Ticket on 19.04.19 online, flight on the same day in the evening, wanted to book luggage but did not go online. I called the customer service on the phone I was told it often happens that it does not work with the luggage and he looks. Then I am told that it is not because i fly the same day as I have booked. But it would be no problem I can pay at the Airport my luggage it costs 20kg for 25Euro. I never asked if it would really cost so much. He repeated it again yes is it. So now the surprise. I stand at the switch in Antalya and I am told I should pay per kg 7Euros. Clouds that are eating me up. The luggage costs me 140 Euro. And you can do nothing. A fly it cost 30 Euro per Person and luggage 140Euro?

### "awful company"
Crete to Stuttgart. Awful company. It was my first and last time! Arrogant and not polite staff, old and dirty airplane. I booked our holiday from TUI, and I didn’t expect that another company will be used for the return flight. We flight from Crete to Stuttgart, 10 min after the flight departed we were informed that there is problem with the airplane and we must land in Athens. It was 30 min on the plane with closed doors and without air conditioning. It was 32’ outside without water, babies and kids were crying. They inform us that an engineer must come the check the problem, so we stayed almost 3 hours in Athens airport. Terrible experience - never again with Corendon Airlines.

### "noisy and old B737-400"
Alghero to Amsterdam. Flight departed 1.5 hours late. Safety procedures were rushed. Check in had been a chaos because the seatplan of the plane didn't match with the online seat reservation system (for a different type of aircraft). During check in Corendon personel said a different type of aircraft that was going to be used, not telling (when asked by me) that this was going to be a noisy and nearly 30 years old B737-400 (without sufficient leg space). The outward flight was relatively (apart from the toilet where people over 1.60 couldn't stand up straight and a lack of leg space) and that's why i rate 3/10.

### "help you avoid this airline"
Amsterdam to Ohrid. This company was a joke before I even got off the ground. I booked a flight/hotel deal from Amsterdam to Lake Ohrid, Macedonia. I have been there several times before and wanted to go to Albania. I booked a more expensive day (Friday versus a Saturday, and paid single supplement) because frankly there was no possible way to get back to my home from Schiphol at 4 AM. I realize it's a charter and know the game but they kept changing the return departure time, with no notice (I only accidentally noticed when I was booking a seat) and they eventually settled on the same time/date as it would have been if I had booked the Saturday flight. No notice, no refund and really no class. I called them and they said they were really unsure when the return flight would be. I decided to cut my losses at this totally defunct way of doing business and fear of what would happen to me if I actually went to Macedonia with them. Lesson learned at 40% penalty and hope I can help you avoid this airline as well.

### "budget tourist carrier"
Amsterdam to Heraklion. Corendon is the typical, small budget tourist carrier that you fly because of lack of alternatives. From the moment you board, a friendly but small staff tries to shove everything through your throat for money. From a glass of water to a bargain offer of an unknown jewellery brand. If you feel the urge to buy something from the inflight magazine make sure you have checked Aliexpress or Wish first (unless you are hungry or thirsty). Also, if you are a believer of info that comes from the flightdeck, make sure you doublecheck. And chances are you will be delayed. Up to about 2 hours and 55 minutes because after 3 hours they have to pay you on certain routes. If you depart on time, congrats -and chances are you will arrive way earlier than scheduled, it's like they have managed to squeeze more minutes into an hour.

### "first time and last time"
No complaints about the seats. Row 1 with lots of space for a fair price. Inbound flight had a delay of 4 hours. No compensation of any kind because the European compensation rules do not apply to Corendon Airlines Turkey. Comfort and staff are fine. Nevertheless first time and last time, unless I am 100% sure the flight will be operated by Corendon Dutch Airlines.

### "a good charter airline"
We flew from Amsterdam-Antalya return with Corendon Airlines, the flight was on time and the service was good.The seats were okay and the leg space could be better but we were sitting on row 32. The crew was very nice. The return was also a pleasant flight, we were sitting on row 15 where the leg space was better there. On this flight the crew spoke Dutch as well. Corendon is a good charter airline.

### Corendon Airlines customer review
Amsterdam to Faro return with Corendon Airlines. Both flights were on time and with all the comfort and service paid for. Ample room on my XL seats. Staff friendly and competent.

### "cabin staff really polite and friendly"
Was flying yesterday from Amsterdam to Athens with Transavia but the flight was operated by Corendon Airlines. I was not happy at all with this because I was not informed for this and also I had never heard of Corendon before - this was not Corendon's fault of course. I have to admit that the flight was very good, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the pilot was a woman (first time to fly with a woman pilot). The best impression was made by the the cabin staff who were really polite and friendly, maybe the best I've ever met. Also the plane was very clean and the seats comfortable with sufficient leg space. Well done Corendon.

### "I would fly them again"
Corendon Airlines flight from Münster to Antalya. Clean aircraft, nice staff, punctual. The food was good, seat is okay for the fare paid. I would fly them again.

### Corendon Airlines customer review
Flight was good, but cabin crew were impolite to passengers. My mother asked several times for a pillow but they did not consider and replied my mom very impolitely in a bad tone. one of the crew pour a glass of orange juice on my clothing while serving the dinner and just gave me some napkins.

### Corendon Airlines customer review
NUE-AYT charter in November'14  Very nice flight altogether. Charter flight but the last one of the season so plane almost empty. Cabin crew fairly relaxed and joking around a bit. Plane seemed in good condition and clean. Overhead LCD displays every few rows with basic entertainment- enough for the 3 hr flight. The cheese - roll snack was absolutely inedible but I did not mind. Plenty of free drinks which were served multiple times by the crew.

### Corendon Airlines customer review
AMS-ERCAN-AMS. Flights to ECN do not fly direct but via Antalya (ATY) due to international flying regulations to N. Cyprus. Old B738. Cabin full of young holiday makers chaotic boarding and dismemberment. No clear instructions to passengers on landing at ATY. Half-hour after landing crew announces passengers to disembark and change to a sister plane. On return at around 1am captain announces problems with wheel during landing at ATY. Passengers ferried to transit lounge waiting for plane to be repaired. Resume journey 90 min later. No announcements made in English except some Dutch and local language not even at ATY airport. FA totally unprofessional and rude especially on the return flight. Aircraft's old cramped soiled seating cabin lights blinking badly maintained aircraft's. No IFE. Food expensive and of low quality. Not recommended will never fly Corendon.

### Corendon Airlines customer review
Being disabled check-in was quick and easy with help from staff. I got a whole row A-C for myself. I was allowed to keep my walker to the aircraft entrance. In earlier reviews there were complaints about the cleanliness of toilets. On this flight a stewardess went in to clean after each use of passengers. Good 737-800 and on time both ways Stockholm-Antalaya.

### Corendon Airlines customer review
Amsterdam-Antalya-Amsterdam. Reasonable flight capable and pleasant FA's. Legroom sufficient for me. Refreshments pricey and low quality. Passengers should be aware that this is a non-EU company and that as such the protection of rights in the event of delay cancellations and such is not applicable.

### Corendon Airlines customer review
A'dam-Antalya and return. One negative comment; the very narrow seats specially with a 15 year old child on your lap no knee space at all and I'm just 180 cm. My husband had to put his legs behind his neck in order to sit. We fly regularly but never in such narrow seats. The 4 hour flight time becomes very long because of this. Extra leg space at the emergency exits costs € 15- p.p. extra but not available when you travel with children. Check-in was quick both times. Service is excellent very friendly staff. No snacks/drinks included. The plane wasn't the youngest but except the dirty toilets it was acceptable. If you're not that tall and don't intent to use the toilets or on board services I can recommend this airline.

Cluj to Antalya return and service was excellent. We were offered free meals drinks crew was very nice. Even though it's a low-cost airline I would recommend them to anyone who would like to go to Turkey.
