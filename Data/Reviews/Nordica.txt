### "worst airline I’ve ever used"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline I’ve ever used. They cancelled our morning flight at 9.15 am, 8 pm the night before only by email with no compensation and barely an apology. Instead we were rebooked to a flight departing at 8pm in the night! Since we were only spending one night at the location we didn’t have any time to do what we planned. The day after we were supposed to take a flight home departing at 4.55 pm, but got a call 3.45, barely an hour before informing us that the flight was cancelled and that we were rebooked for a flight leaving 5 hours later from a different airport. This was clearly not new information for the company, had they been able to inform us about this earlier we would have been able to take an earlier flight. This has led us to get nothing out of the trip as well as missing the plans we had when we got home. This is absolutely atrocious and I will never use this company again.

### "the flight itself was unbearable"
Not Verified |  I had a business trip from Hamburg to Stockholm, I hated this flight. The cabin crew were quite nice but the flight itself was unbearable! The seats were very dirty and the floor was very sticky like someone had spilt a soda! I do not like this airline and I'm not going to fly it again! My meal was very dry, I had to drink so much with the meal to make it somewhat bearable.

### "legroom is more than okay"
Warsaw to Tallinn. Our flight was in code-share with LOT Polish Airlines. Between our arrival and departure there were 55 minutes (gate opens 30 mins before departure), the ground crew worked very well so we could catch our Nordica flight to Tallinn with ease. The seats are comfortable, the legroom is more than okay. Bigger meals and drinks are available on purchase but they serve complementary drinks (coffee, tea, water) and snacks (chocolate bar). The cabin crew was kind and the cabin was clean.

### "sign of high professionalism"
Stockholm to Tallinn with Nordica (a LOT flight). Upon boarding flight LO8122 on Feb 14 there were three drunk youngsters who had been quite loud in the terminal building and this went on in the plane. The flight attendants noted the guys, made quick analyses of their behaviour and personalities and approached them in a strict, polite but decisive way. Their approach was perfect given the situation. The guys got the message and behaved. This was a sign of high professionalism from the FAs. In addition to that the CRJ 900 was fresh and clean - Announcements were perfect.
