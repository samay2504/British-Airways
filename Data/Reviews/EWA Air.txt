### "they grudgingly checked me in"
It was a Bad Day at Dzaoudzi (DZA) in Mayotte. On a European passport, I was to fly from Mayotte to Moroni, Comoros. The surly check-in girl asked for my return ticket. I said I didn't have one with me but I had a return ticket to Paris CDG and onwards to LHR. No, that was not OK, said her supervisor. I live in Britain and I have no intention of staying too long in the Comoros, I said. No! It was not going to work. Frantic calls to my travel agent etc revealed that I did have a return ticket with another airline. So I got to their desk, paid Euro 5 for a copy and returned to the EWA air check-in. After serious scrutiny they grudgingly checked me in. Sad airline! The flight was uneventful and on an ATR 72.600The flight was only 55 mins. The legroom was good.
