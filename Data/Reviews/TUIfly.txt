### "144 usd extra because of backpack overweight"
Not Verified |  They almost made me to miss my flights. They made me to pay 144 usd extra because of backpack overweight which could only be 3kg which was not stated anywhere and also a joke as it is always 10kg at least normally. After paying they still made me to unpack my backpacks and pack the overweight separately as I can not bring it on board it has to go below. The most uncomfortable experience, also after 25 years of flying the first time someone measured my backpack and also be that picky. Never again.

### "rarely encountered such rip-off"
Not Verified | Accidentally filled in the wrong last name (not the maiden name) when requesting the ticket. You just get to hear that buying a new ticket without a refund of the old ticket is the only option (It simply cannot be changed anymore!) If only I had checked the premium box (for 60 euros per person) then it would not have been a problem to change it! I have rarely encountered such rip-offs. I understand that I should pay for a change, but just saying that I should just buy a completely new ticket really goes way too far. And then I will have to resell that seat that has already been paid for. Per ongeluk de verkeerde achternaam (niet de meisjesnaam) ingevuld bij de aanvraag van het ticket. Krijg je gewoon te horen dat een nieuw ticket kopen zonder restitutie van oude ticket de enige optie is (Het kan gewoon niet meer aangepast worden!) Had ik het premiuim vinkje (voor 60,= euro p.p.) maar aan moeten vinken dan was het geen probleem geweest om het aan te passen! Zelden zulke afzetters mee gemaakt. Ik snap dat ik zou moeten betalen voor een wijziging maar gewoon doodleuk zeggen dat ik maar een compleet nieuw ticket moet kopen gaat echt veel en veel te ver. En straks wel die stoel die al betaald is nog een keer doorverkopen...

### “Worst experience ever”
Worst experience ever. I missed my flight as my first flight was delayed because of the weather. When I contacted Tui they couldn’t offer any help, they didn’t have a different flight to offer me, and they didn’t want to refund anything for the flight I never took.

### “service was great”
Neos (airline) division of TUI Germany. You can web check-in and you can change seat allocation without pay. Plane arrived on time, boarding and welcome was professional and crew was helping passengers with their carry-ons to be placed on bins. New and clean aircraft, service was great with two servings with tasty food and good variety of juices (do not offer beverages) but have wine, coffee, tea. IFE is only drop screens to see the flight path and you can hear music from channels with earphones (buy or your own).

### "what you expect from a budget carrier"
This is a budget airline. Had it not been for the fact that this flight was heavily undercooked, and we didn't have a row to ourselves, I believe this 10hour+ flight would have been extremely uncomfortable. As it turns out we were able to stretch out and relax. The service and meals are what you would expect from a budget carrier. I would not book this flight if I knew it would be full.

### "efficient on-board service"
Not Verified | Pleasant company with competent and attentive staff. Respected schedule and efficient on-board service. It was unfortunately the last flight on this route between Toulon and Charleroi

### "Pleasant on-board service"
Not Verified | No problem with this airline. Pleasant on-board service. Schedule respected. Aircraft (ES-SAA) leased from an Estonian company. Very good experience.

### "how inattentive the flight staff is"
When I think about what tuifly at prices to get there and back to Crete and when I then see on the flight from Crete (X3 4107 on 26.8) how inattentive the flight staff is. Children at the age of 2 do not even get a small attention let alone even a smile of the seller or flight attendants and a simple coffee 3-4 euros should cost then I am more than served. It is a tragedy with how little or no service money is earned.

### "one of the worst services"
Not Verified |  Staff attentive but not overly friendly; given that the crew already had a 16hrs working day (as told by one of the cabin crew) still OK. What wasn't OK at all: being ordered to the airport and being told just after checking in and passing the security line that the flight is delayed for 7 hrs. Thank you for having me, my wife and two toddlers waiting in a wee airport at 38 degrees outside while wasting a whole day which we could have spent at the hotel pool instead. Nobody was present by Tuifly at the airport, the hotline was constantly unavailable, and all we got was a voucher by E-mail of 15 EUR. To be spent at mediocre facilities on location. No word of sorry, no one to talk to - we all have been left to our own, basically. Best even: they served food and drinks on the plane and wanted to charge money after this disaster. Not to mention that we received our luggage in FRA in a very bad condition. This is one of the worst services I have ever encountered and will not fly with this airline ever again.

### "clean planes and pleasant (young) cabin crew"
Brussels Zaventem - Fuerteventura Return. Slight delay on the outbound flight due to late arrival of the plane at Brussels Airport but final arrival in Fuerteventura was on time. Return flight had a delay of a bit less then 2hrs due to technical problems with the first foreseen plane. We had the nice Boeing Sky Interior on the return plane so that was a plus! In general clean planes and pleasant (young) cabin crew on both flights. Meals and drinks for purchase but nice selections though. We booked and paid for emergency exit seats so that we would have extra legroom, highly recommendable on such longer flights imho! I understood that one young lady on the outbound flight did not speak Dutch...for a Belgian airline this is not acceptable though!

### "Really bad services"
Really bad services and no information for our 4h30mn delay. We had a flight from Bruxelles to Heraklion. Our flight was supposed to be at 6.30, we arrive at the airport without seeing the flight on the board. We had no email, no information until we saw the number of our flight at 10am on the board. We waited 3h30 then had the number of the gate 20mns before the “supposed” 10am departure. No information from the crew until we seated in the aircraft and 40 more minutes of delay once on the plane. For sure we will not take this company again. We flight quite often and it’s the worst company we experimented.

### "We have your money, and what can you do?"
I have purchased tickets to fly from Amsterdam to Ibiza. TUI officially announced in media that no flights will be cancelled, everything looked good until the last moment, when I suddenly got an email that my flight got moved to Liege, different country, 270km away. The flight was schedule on 6.20 morning Saturday so because I worked on Friday evening and there is totally no night transportation between Amsterdam and Liege, there was no way for me to get to Liege. I have called TUI and a very polite lady told me, that indeed there is no other way but to cancel the tickets and she can do it for me. I asked her, to be sure if the funds will be transferred back to my account, she confirmed (I got credit note and cancellation bill) and that’s the moment when the show begins. The email on their website doesn’t work, when after an hour waiting you finally get someone on the phone, they send you to chat, after days of waiting for answer on messenger the tell you to call (with a smiley), on twitter they say that: “it is busy and I probably received the money because system says: 0€” so basically their approach is: "We have your money, and what can you do?

### "It is a scam please avoid this airline"
I have never wrote a review before and I travel really often. This was by far the worst airline ever! I’ve traveled with a lot of airline companies that have an excellent customer service and the TUI fly service was the worst. My flight got delayed without telling us a reason and I lost my two connection flights to the other destinations. I went to their customer service department in Brussels and the ladies didn’t help me at all, didn’t advise me what should I do and they were laughing at me. Their customer service in Miami told me that for sure my lost flight will be rescheduled in Belgium and nothing happened. They don’t know their own policy at all. I was so frustrated that I bought extra ticket for my connection flights and I had zero help from their department. They told me to go to an agency near them to book a new ticket which was 500€. That’s what they do delay/cancel flights in order to go to an agency near them to book a new flight. It is a scam please avoid this airline.

### "the seats were quite comfortable"
Flight departed on time. This was the first time I flew the 737-800 MAX with TUI. The interior was really modern and the seats were quite comfortable for a 4.5 hour flight. There were USB outlets on every chair, and the catering was okay. Overall great flight!

### "want to change their seat configuration"
First time on TUI flight. Booked Deluxe Class (Premium Economy) to Curacao. Boarding was good as well as the onboard experience. Two major air carrier from AMS-CUR are KLM and TUI. Despite TUI fly their B787, however Deluxe class non-flatbed seats are unbeatable against KLM flatbed. Wonder if TUI ever want to change their seat configuration to compete their competitor at least on their long-haul flight. Delayed for almost 1 hour and it seemed they were expecting for their stand-by cabin crews to arrived. Catering onboard was great however. Wine and champagne are still available.

### "Customer service is for customer service"
I have now asked for a refund 3 times, but no response. If this is the customer service offered, I am surprised that any of the aircraft leave the ground. Customer service is for customer service. If no response is offered I will be posting on all my social media accounts the non return of requests or the non answering of enquiries.

### "not answering me anymore"
Marrakech to Paris. My flight was canceled, which I can perfectly understand. Once back, because of the law I am supposed to receive 400€. I have get in touch with them via email, they were answering me. After two months without receiving my money, I have got in touch with them several times in the email and on Facebook, and they are not answering me anymore. I can understand everything, but not answering when they are reading my emails and messages om Facebook is disrespectful.

### "the flight was enjoyable"
Düsseldorf to Hurghada. The service on board was friendly but keep in mind that drinks and food is not included in the ticket price. The drink and food menu offers a wide range of drinks and snacks. The legroom was decent, however the seats had limited storage space. Tuifly is a typical holiday carrier, expect children and a lot of noise. Overall the flight was enjoyable. The flight departed in time, after arrival in Eqypt we were committed to scan our body temperature and fill out a health card, due to the Coronavirus.

### "seats were so horrendous"
On December 15th me and my partner flew from Curacao to Amsterdam, with a stop at Aruba, on a Boeing 767-300ER of TUIfly Netherlands. Check-in was quick, but due to a late arrival of the aircraft boarding started late. Passengers to Amsterdam had to board first, while the passengers from Amsterdam to Aruba were asked to board second and fill up the remaining unassigned seats. The flight to Aruba was very quick (only 20 minutes) and no serviced was provided due to the short flight time. At Aruba the passengers to Amsterdam were asked to remain seated while the aircraft was prepared for its last leg to Amsterdam. After 90 minutes on the ground we departed slightly later then planned to Amsterdam. The seats were extremely narrow (this 767 was equipped with a 2-4-2 configuration, instead of the designed 2-3-2 configuration). Legroom was good, because we booked comfort class (a pitch of 33 inch), but the seats weren’t equipped with head rests. The interior looked also very dated due to the old overhead bins. The entertainment system was fine with a limited but good selection of movies and television series. After take-off dinner was served (chicken with onion sauce, which was not very good) with a non-alcoholic drink service, after which coffee or tea were served. The lights were dimmed (it was a night flight) and two hours before arrival breakfast was served (a croissant with a yoghurt and a drink). To conclude, the cabin crew was great, polite and very professional. But to be honest, the seats were so horrendous that I would not fly TUI again on this aging 767.

### "it was a good experience"
Amsterdam to Curacao on December 7th with TUI fly Netherlands, operated by a Boeing 787-8. Check-in was quite chaotic at Amsterdam, with multiple TUI departures at the same time and only one staff member trying to sent passengers to the right check-in row (check-in or bag drop-off). Boarding on the other hand was very smooth and efficient. I prebooked Economy comfort (34 inch leg space), seat 12A, which was quite comfortable. The seat was quite narrow though. The seat was equipped with an PTV with a pretty small selection of movies. A free headset and pillow were distributed. After take off the crew came around with a drink service (alcohol was charged), follow by a hot (small) meal with a drink and coffee or tea. During the flight it was possible to order paid snacks or drinks, but there were also two complementary drink rounds. Two hours before landing a sandwich with a slice of cake were handed out, which was really tasteful. The flight itself was uneventful, and the crew was really friendly and professional. Overall, it was a good experience for a typical holiday airline.

### "Just bad practices"
Heraklion to Brussels. How to make extra money on clients? I booked my ticket late in the evening, close to midnight. I received 10 minutes later a “cancellation of reservation due to late payment arrival”. Then it was after midnight and I processed again my request. No email to acknowledge receipt whatsoever. In the morning, convinced the payment did not go through I rebooked my ticket. Then I received the two confirmations in one go. I called them, they accepted to reimburse me the ticket but minus 12 euros of double reservation. No chance to explain this was their IT system not working, just a wall of denial. For information the ticket was 200 euros and thus this was not a low price ticket. I am very annoyed they never admitted their website is dysfunctional and make clients pay for it on top of course of the very expensive call you have to pay when complaining. Just bad practices and it is sad this is permitted.

### "happy to fly with them again"
Brussels Charleroi to Tenerife South return. Both aircraft leased from SmartLynx but despite their age of +\- 20 years, they were well maintained. Both flights left with a delay of 40-50 minutes on departure but arrived more or less on time (thanks to the 30 mins extra flight time most airlines add). Friendly crew. Acceptable choice of food and drinks to buy on board. Will be happy to fly with them again!

### "have to pay for check-in"
Punta Cana to Brussels on hand luggage only ticket. I'm not satisfied with their luggage policy and customer service on check-in counter. They charged me 30$ for small cabin luggage which I wanted to check-in. The size and weight of luggage were correct (55x40x20cm/10kg) but they said that I have to pay for check-in. On my departure flight from Brussels to Punta Cana I checked-in my luggage without any problem, no charge, but on my way back staff at Punta Cana Airport took 30$ and treated me with disrespect. I will never travel again with TUI!

### "staff were really rude"
Not Verified |  Paris to Rabat. First thing, there is no online check-in! When you do the online check-in they only send you a confirmation of the reservation even though you choose your seat! Please be careful. I was victim of that. I arrived 5 minutes after they finished the check-in, they didn’t even give me much attention. The staff were really rude and not professional. I do not recommend this company at all and for sure it will be the last time ever with them.

### "uncomfortable for a 4 hour flight"
Berlin to Fuerteventura. Bad experience, narrow seats, almost no legroom, uncomfortable for a 4 hour flight; for the better seats you have to pay 30 or 35 euros, although the tickets are not cheap. catering is expensive and not good. rude passengers pushing their sears back without asking and even reacting aggressively when you ask them to push the seat back in upright position; Long check in lines, no inflight entertainment, seats in left 11 row have no window.

### "managed situation very well"
Brussels to Montego Bay via Santo Domingo. Although we had a lot of problems with our flight, TUIFly managed the situation very well. On the day of departure, our flight from Brussels to Montego Bay got canceled because of some technical issues with the airplane. We were really upset because we were supposed to leave for our honeymoon, so all our anger was directed towards TUI. They explained to us what has happened and that we shall leave the next day, so they provided accommodation, meals and transfers. Everything was very well organized and the staff was very helpful. After coming back from our honeymoon, we also filed a complaint for the delay resulting in us missing one night in Jamaica, and the airline compensated us, no questions asked, according to the EU regulations. Now you may say that TUIFly caused us a lot of inconveniences and that may be true. But technical problems with an airplane can happen now and then. It is the way the airline handled the situation after that: great accommodation (Crowne Plaza Brussels), buffet dinner (very good quality), prompt transfers back to the airport, and proper compensation according to EU regulations for delayed/canceled flights. I think that every time we fly there is a chance of unforeseeable delay / cancellation, and it is the way customers are treated that makes the difference. And from this standpoint, TUIFly is definitely 10/10.

### "A very poor experience"
Heraklion to Bristol. A very poor experience both in terms of customer service and travel. We had difficulty with checking in to begin with, to which we were met with unhelpful and impolite customer service. Furhermore, the flight itself (which was already a late one - scheduled to take off at 11.15pm) was delayed by almost an hour with little explanation as to why. Once on the flight, the lights were kept on for an unnecessary amount of time, meaning sleep was impossible. The air-con was on to the max, turning the plane into a fridge, and when we asked for a blanket we were charged £6 which is extortionate for a product that should be provided for free - and is by many competitor airlines, namely BA. We will not be flying with TUI again, and expected more despite the budget prices.

### "delayed again and again"
Cancun to Amsterdam. I was scheduled to fly on 17th December, arrived to the airport and went through the check-in and all the security checks. After that, we (as for all the passengers) were waiting to board, which had seemed to start any minute. But it was being delayed every ten minutes for another ten minutes until there was a 4 hour delay at which point the pilots came to inform us there were some issues with the airplane's computer, which they were trying to fix, but they would reboot the computer's system and we'd be boarding in an hour. Another hour passed and the pilots came, saying at 2 A.M. (5 hours after the scheduled time of takeoff) that they weren't able to fix the problem and that all the passengers are gonna be accommodated in a five-star hotel for the night (after we get our visas back and go again through immigration) and that we would be informed what the next step is in the morning. I asked if I wasnt going to go to the hotel, if I could get the money instead, so I can buy food and water in the airport, they said no. Next morning I was waiting for any kind of information about the new flight. There was none in the airport and none on my email or my cellphone. Meanwhile my girlfriend arrived, we said our goodbyes and she left before I had at least some minor information about my flight, although the international departure board was all the time showing that the check-in for my flight was about to begin in 40 minutes. But 40 minutes turned out to be the whole day and at about 5 P.M. the check-in opened for my flight. I was lucky they hadn't changed the terminal because I wouldn't have found out. OK, I went through the check-in again, through security checks again and the flight was delayed again and again and again, unsure to even take-off that night. In the end we departed from a different gate and 25 hours later but we departed. I am trying to make a complaint to get compensation for the delayed flight. There is an official complaint app at the airline's website. It doesn't work. So I wrote an email. They answered that I have to complain at the website's official complain program. I sent another email, saying that for whatever reason I cannot get inside that program. I sent them the official  complaint form and all the information they needed to know. Their answer after that was that my email was empty and I have to write a new one. It takes 2 days for them to answer every time. So I wrote a new one.

### "It was a good flight"
Kos to Ostend. It was a good flight and that cabin crew was friendly and can speak at least 3 languages (French, Dutch and English). When you have a question, they will try to help you with a smile. It was a Boeing 737 without entertainment on the flight. It was an older aircraft, but there weren't any problems with the hygiene.

### "service on the plane was good"
Ostend to Kos. It was a good flight from a secondary airport in Belgium (Ostend, the primary airport is Brussels). There wasn’t a delay and the service on the plane was good (really friendly). It was an older aircraft, but the hygiene was good. It was a Boeing 737 without entertainment on the flight.

### "would personally use again"
Birmingham to Dubrovnik. We boarded on time we were surprised as we paid for extra leg room and they were all gone apart from two seats but meant we couldn't sit together. On the way back we managed to book them. On the way good flight but I noticed about 6 seats extra leg room were empty. After a quick word with the stewardess we were able to move and sit together. Comfy seats we didn't pay for anything on refreshments or food as well its a rip off. Flight home on time but Dubrovnik was very windy as not the most confident passenger the captain did say it was going to be a rough take off. Yes it was not a good experience but something that was out of their control. Apart from that a good flight home. Air stewards ok a bit snooty which I find most of the time. I would personally use again.

### "never take this airline again"
Chania to Brussels via Kos. I was supposed to fly with my infant daughter and my mother a 3 hour direct trip from Chania to Brussels on 30 June. Two weeks before the flight we received a message that our flight would take 6 hours due to a stopover in Kos Island. I called the airline and asked what it was about - they said no worries, a small stopover, you will not need to disembark. Ok, suboptimal but acceptable til now. On the day of the flight, we check in normally, and when we look to take our seats, they were occupied. I tell the attendants that I must sit with my infant daughter and mother, and they just say to randomly take seats because the plane is totally unoccupied. Ok. We sit. I then ask if we have to switch to our assigned seats on the Kos stopover, because it will be extremely difficult for me to carry the baby, all the baby bags, and my own stuff, wake the baby up (she sleeps at takeoff), and move. They say we'll do our best for you to keep your seats. At Kos we are suddenly announced to disembark because they have to fuel up and the policy is no passengers during fueling (although all the crew remained on board). What a mess. Talked to other discontent passengers, many had huge delays when flying into Chania in the first place (ex. flight scheduled for 6 am finally takes off at 8 am). Then get back on the plane to the assigned seats, try to calm the baby down, etc. Of couse needless to say nobody helped with the baby. I'm glad we arrived safe and that our luggage was not lost. But I would never take this airline again. It's cheap, but Ryanair is luxury compared to TuiFly.

### "Awful experience"
Paris to Marrakech. The plane arrived 4 hours late and we had no communication at all. Then we finally boarded but we waited a lot and could not take off because a passenger fell while onboarding. He got injured but the crew let us in. Doctors came and asked him to leave the plane but the passenger refused to leave. We eventually took off. The crew during the flight was the most impolite I have seen. I did not feel good and asked for water. The woman said she would bring some but never came back. We arrived 5 hours late. Awful experience. Won't recommend this airline to anyone

### "service level is very low"
Amsterdam to Aruba. The service level of this company is very low. You have to pay for everything on board. During my 9hr flight we have to pay for media entertainment 10euro, Coffee: 2,5euro, Coke, etc. We recieved one meal during 9hrs. You better take another company if they cost 100-200 euro more because it is more than worth it.

### "this very bad airline"
Amsterdam to Fuerteventura. Bad flight : Delayed - more than 2.4 hrs. Tuifly Netherlands once again put us in another plane. According to the schedule was would the Boeing 787 flown. Two days before that failed to technical problems. Now our airplane was an A340 HiFly nearly 22 years old. We pay for more expensive seats - comfort class, but had to take a seat in economy, Zero leg space, my seat could not lean backwards. Very poor onboard entertainment and food. So we never fly with this very bad airline.

### "seats cramped and hard"
Miami to Brussels. I think that TUIfly tries really hard to offer comfort for their guests, but really does not hit the mark. The seats are very narrow, which makes sitting quite uncomfortable, especially for larger people. We were lucky that after takeoff we were able to change seats. Unfortunately there seems to be little padding in the seat cushion.. The food was pretty gross looking, but was edible. The staff offered lots of water to passengers, which was great, but only came around twice with other beverages. I was not expecting there to be any entertainment onboard, thus I was very happy to find that there were a few movies and TV shows available. My personal TV was actually broken, but since the seat next to me was empty, I was able to use that one instead. Overall, the staff were nice, and the plane seemed relatively clean. However, the seats were just too cramped and the seats too hard to be comfortable on such a long flight.

### "Never again with Tuifly"
Dubai to Amsterdam via Bucharest with TUIfly. Poor seats, and lots of delays. At departure (beging the first flight of the day) as well as during refuelling in Romania. What was announced as a 30 minute stop resulted in 2 hours. Disgrace, they should get it together! Never again with Tuifly for me.

### "cabin crew always very friendly"
Sal, Cape Verde to Amsterdam. I have flown a few times with TUIfly on flights from 3 to 10 hours and I've never had a lot of complaints. Everything costs extra, except for 1 meal and drink on long-haul flights, but I didn't expect anything else for their fares. The ground and cabin crew are always very friendly and helpful. On most flights I 
booked economy comfort class, because the leg room in economy just isn't a lot, but comfort class is rather comfortable.

### "by far my worst experience"
Varadero to Amsterdam via Cancun with TUIfly. I've done a lot of long distance flights but this was by far my worst experience. You have to pay 15 euros for inflight entertainment (which was not working during the flight back), you get only one meal during a trip of 14 hours, you get a few glasses of water for free and 1 coffee or tea. After a whole night of flying in the morning, we didn't get breakfast and I had to pay 2,5 euros for a coffee! Finally, during the flight from Varadero to Cancun, I couldn't sit at my own seat so I was separated from the rest of the people I was traveling with. It was on a first come, first serve basis. Made me think about Ryanair 5 years ago. During the long flight from Cancun to Amsterdam, there were a lot of couples also not sitting next to each other but with the aisle in between or sitting the seat before or after each other. Unbelievable for a flight of more than 8 hours. The price difference with another airline will have to be really big before I will fly with TUI again.

### "never fly TUIfly again"
From Fuerteventura to Dusseldorf on TUIfly, I was returning home after a short holiday in January with my wife and children. Check in was messed up and the staff at the airport don't understand German or English. Boarding the plane was chaos as the crew did not greet people as normal. The plane was new and the seats was not comfortable. The crew was not helpful. There is no food and beverages as well as entertainment onboard even. I will never fly with TUIfly again.

### "seats uncomfortable"
Old aircraft, seats very narrow and uncomfortable, however so called Premium Class did not look much different. The food was average, strange tasting, served in unsuitable packaging. However the cabin staff was extremely positive, friendly and helpful.

### "No complaints at all"
Amsterdam to Antalya with TUIfly. Kind and polite staff. Clean plane with a strange economy and comfort concept. Comfort first rows quite expensive, but emergency exit rows with double the space for a fair €12 extra. Food and drinks for sale. Not cheap but good quality. Both flights on time. No complaints at all.

### "almost everything is paid-service"
This intercontinental TUIfly flight from Amsterdam to Curaçao of 10hrs is low-cost, so almost everything is paid-service: drinks (except water and 1 coffee or tea), food (except 1 meal), checked-in luggage (starting at €8 x 2) and entertainment (starting at €7.50 x 2). The entertainment you pay for also has little choice and will probably be the same on you return flight. Also compare leg space - I was suprised by this, and next time I would choose a slightly more expensive airline (to me €80 extra would definitely be worth it). Besides this, the service is good and the airplane is comfortable and clean. Just make a fair comparison in price between airline options, with TUIfly you will have at least €40 extra costs!

### "if price is good I would fly them again"
Our return flight from Herkaklion on Crete to Frankfurt on September 25th started with a long queue outside the airport. TUIfly had so many passengers on that day that there wasn't enough space for all people inside the terminal. We had to wait 1 hour for the baggage drop off. Half of the time staying in the sun. Everything seemed to be very disorganized. The aircraft arrived early on Crete which ment also an early departure and arrival for us. The plane was around 9 years old and owned by TUIfly. A totally different experience than on the way to Crete with a leased airplane. The seat offered a very comfortable seat pitch with plenty of space to move around. The cabin and washrooms looked clean. On cabin screens the safety video, an airshow and advertisement were shown. Also on some tables stickers with advertisement were installed. While boarding the flight attendants distributed wine gums to everybody. During the flight we had the same choice between a sandwich with cheese or ham. It seemed the flight Crew was quiet desinterested in their job. No smile at all, noisy deposit of service equipment and slang-announcements by the purser. But the flight crew gave us often information concerning the flight. Don't expect much, but if the price is good I would fly them again.

### "seats felt quite cramped"
We flew from Frankfurt to Crete (Heraklion) on September 18th with TUIfly. The flight was booked via a travel agency with a baggage allowance of 20kg and onboard service included. When booking TUIfly it is very important to see whats included in your flight as many differences excist (from 15kg to 20kg for checked bags, free snack and drink on board or for extra charges). Online check-in was already possible 30 days in advance and easy. The computer is deciding about your seats, filling the plane from the back to the front. So if you don't like your assigned seats just wait a while and try to check-in again, because a seatchange will cost you EUR13 per person and segment. For dropping of bags in the morning two counters were open and a long queue in front of them. It took around 40 mins to line up. Aircraft was parked on a remote stand. Departure was delayed by 15-20 mins without any Information given on board (2 passengers came late). Later on routing and current landing time were given frequently. During the service, flight attendants ask you if you have snack and drink included (printed on a separate boarding card) or you like to purchase anything from the café menu in your seatpocket (if there). We had a choice between a bun with cheese or ham which was ok but nothing special and could choose between coffee, tea or a softdrink. Good thing: softdrinks are handed over in a 0,5 liter bottle with a cup. Duty free shopping followed. Crew average, neither friendly or unfriendly. Nothing special to remember. As the plane was ex Sunexpress the seats looked different and after nearly 3 hours of flight I felt quite cramped and it was hard to move. No entertainment or airshow was shown, only the safety video on cabin screens. Aircraft looked quiet old and even if the plane was parked over night in Frankfurt the seatpockets (magazine, sickbag, menu card, etc.) were not filled up. Return flight on a TUIfly aircraft was much better even if the crew was worse.

### TUIfly customer review
TUIFly has been converted into a Low-Cost-Airline by May 2014! Only 15kg of baggage are allowed and no inflight- service is provided. The flight from Crete to Germany was on-time but it seemed the aircraft cleaners did a very poor job. Booked with a package-tour this product is unacceptable! Unfortunately the rating system requires at least one star even for not provided services (Food/Beverages and Inflight Entertainment).

Flew Hamburg to Fuerteventura. Service was ok. But seat comfort was the worst we've ever had! Absolutely no leg space. You couldn't even read the airline magazine! No one was able to put the seat in a sleeping position because you didn't know what to do with your legs! Maybe ok for a short flight but absolutely not for a 4.5 hours trip. Will never choose them again!

Flew Kos a Greek Island to Dusseldorf. Flight was on a Boeing 737-800. Check in was done in the hotel so we did not do it at the airport. When we arrived there we only needed to go to security. Flight left early since boarding was fast so we arrived 45 minutes before planned arrival. Food service was a hot meal noodles chicken chunks and tomato sauce as well as 2 drinks. Crew was very nice and always smiling. Inflight entertainment was free and on overhead screens.

Flew from Jerez to Dusseldorf trying to get home as cheaply as possible. Flight was €70 one way with baggage included. Crew very pleasant. I do not speak German but this was not a problem for any of the crew. Hot towels on departure hot pancakes for breakfast drinks service little pack of Haribo for descent basket of sweets whilst disembarking all included in the price. This is how flying should be and this supposed "holiday airline" put the "full service" airlines to shame. I will definitely use them again.

CGN-PMI. Flight on a Sunday before vacation time. Check-in was easy and seat request was honored. While boarding newspapers were available. Flight left on time on a Boeing 737. Coffee and Soft drinks as well as a sandwich was provided free. Last year they served a hot meal. After 1 hour and 55 minutes we reached PMI and bags came after a 25-30 minutes waiting time. Seat are kind of hard to sit it but for a short flight still ok. Screens showed comic films for free headset were charged with 5 euros.

CPH-KBV/HKT-CPH on TUIflynordic in Premium class B767. Access to Novia lounge before boarding. Newspaper and water on seat when boarding - after all pax were seated we were offered sparkling wine OJ or water accompanied by a large selection of delicious luxury chocolates. Service onboardcommenced with a drink service and a snack followed by a delicious 3 course meal. All drinks are complimentary. Staff was great. Width of seat could be better but legroom of 94 cm was sufficient. My impression was somewhere between a premium economy and business class experience. Definitely worth the extra money!

Salzburg - Köln Economy class a couple of weeks ago. Had booked this ticket about a month ago for 60 Euros. Check-in was easy friendly and efficient. The one-hour flight was uneventful. Snacks and drinks sold on board at a fair price. The aircraft was clean and the flight attendants cordial though disengaged with passengers. On time departure and arrival. Baggage collection at Köln was fairly quick. Great value for money. Would fly them again.

Cologne-Funchal return economy Class. Holiday flight with hot breakfast (2 choices) and one extra drink round. Flight was on time and baggage was in at right time. Seats are narrow for a 4hr trip but ok. No AVOD but film was shown on overhead screens they charge for earphones. Plane a B737-800 in old colour. Return flight full and we had seats 2C/D. Also 2 hot meal choices and one extra drink turn. Baggage took ages in CGN but since flight was ahead of time no problem. Seats again narrow and do not recline much. Plane had new colour 737-800 again. On both flights crew were nice and did their best.

CGN-FMM (Memmingen/Allgaeu). Very quick and uneventful German domestic flight. Check-in in Cologne was quick and efficient crew friendly. Food/drinks only for purchase. Aircraft was rather old seats and interior tired-looking. Upon arrival nice view over the Alps baggage claim 5 min. after arrival. Memmingen is a very small provincial airport in Bavaria approx. 100 km from Munich.

### TUIfly customer review
Paid EUR 320 for a oneway CGN-CTA. Uncomfortable seating not even providing a flexible pocket in the back of the seat in front of you. If you can avoid to travel on TUIFly I strongly recommend to do so. Especially their flights to the Canarias Egypt or Israel- worst seating I ever experienced. At least we got a meal on board (a bagel) with one free non-alcoholic beverage. If your flight time is less than two hours you have to pay for any food or drink. TUI profiles itself a high standard high quality travel agency - it's aircraft can't fulfil this demand in any possible way.

### TUIfly customer review
Salzburg to Berlin Tegel return. Both Flights left and arrived on time or ahead schedule. Well maintained aircraft (B737-700 and B737-800). Prices for food are ok and acceptable. Pilots kept us well informed but the IFE with the flight-track was shut down during the flight without any reason. All in all a very pleasant experience and TUIfly is worth the money.

### TUIfly customer review
BSL-LPA and return as part of a vacation package. Check-in in Basle easy and smooth although counters open only 2 hours prior to departure instead of 3 hours as issued in their brochures. Flight on time service ok meals mediocre two rounds of drinks. Plane 20 min early on arrival. Return check-in a little chaotic as many planes left the same time. Flight again on time breakfast not to mention two rounds of drinks and a 20 min early arrival into BSL. All in all a fair but uneventful package.

CGN-HAM-CGN B737 all Y-Class normal flight. CGN airbridge to plane and in HAM as well. Since this is a LCC it was ok of course no food and drinks unless you want to pay (coffee 250 EUR or 550 EUR for Coffee and Roll/Cake). Free newspaper/magazin in gally while boarding took place. Tkt was 14000 EUR so it was a good deal. Legroom ok since I had seat 2c/return 1d (Charge for seat 900EUR if booked by internet). Duration only 40 mins so this was just ok would not try to fly long haul with this.

### TUIfly customer review
MAN-STR-MAN. Another more or less perfect set of flights from one of the best low cost carriers around. Able to do online check in and get seats at the front for the outward journey. Middle seat was empty. Flight left early and landed 10 mins early at Stuttgart. On the way back flight landed 30 mins early. Tuifly also offer the option to pre-book a snack which I did (includes soft drink/hot drink) and this is something other LCC's should offer. In fact for a LCC Tuifly offers a great level of service no charge for checking in luggage allocated seating newspapers and low fares plus friendly attentive Flight attendants. £30 was all I paid for this weekend trip so compared to Ryanair/Easyjet etc Tuifly wins hands down!

### TUIfly customer review
Berlin TXL to Cairo and back. For the low price service was good seat pitch acceptable. The meals came in a cheap paper box but were quite tasty plenty of rounds with free non alcoholic drinks newspapers pillows and blankets and comfy leather seats. Toilets were a little bit old and smelly but not dirty. The flight attendants were efficient but not so very patient with some of the non German passengers. I had the impression that they were not used to communicate with a multi national mix of passengers and got easily annoyed to explain things twice. However these were excellent flights at a very reasonable price.

### TUIfly customer review
Berlin Tegel - Las Palmas return. Horrid airline both compared with other typical tourist "charter" airlines and other budget airlines like Easyjet or Germanwings. Tuifly is stuck somewhere in the middle just worse. Checked in online and printed our boarding passes at home only to find out that the "Fast bag drop" line at TXL was full of people who obviously hadn't done the online checkin. Upon asking one of the unfriendly staff members I was told that the bag drop counter "does not work as everything is drowning here in Tegel". How about sending passengers without a printed boarding pass to one of the other counters to make it work? Many others complained about that and started fights with the extremely unable staff members strangely the bag drop worked perfectly fine on the way back in Las Palmas. Had two hour delay on the outbound flight everybody was just waiting around in the terminal and no information was given as to the reasons for the delay no staff visible at the gates. Flight itself was uneventful plane ten years old but maintained poorly. Staff onboard arrogant and alcohol had to be paid. Arrived late in Las Palmas and had to wait for a further hour at the luggage belt for no reason again no staff around. Our transfer driver told us later that TUIfly is known for paying the least of all airlines hence their luggage will be offloaded last. He told us that he had left an hour late as he already knew we would be late. Same thing on the return more than an hour delay. Return aircraft was really dodgy an old 737-300 which looked as if it was about to fall apart any time. Interior worn toilets and seats not cleaned between flights. Also obviously no re-stocking since leaving Germany on the outbound to the Canaries almost all beverages were sold out. It's anyone's guess how maintenance procedures might look like at an airline that otherwise does everything it can so save a buck. Never again!

### TUIfly customer review
MAN-CGN-MAN with TuiFly this past week - could teach EasyJet and Ryanair a thing or two. Good value (130 Euros return) speedy friendly check-in seat pre-selection at no additional cost 20kg of checked bags at no additional cost. Spotless 737 with reasonably priced on-board catering. Decent seats with fair leg-room. Flight crew efficient and smiling. A breath of fresh-air after some of the snarling horrors I have encountered on other LCCs. At the moment they only serve MAN and NCL in the UK from a handful of German airports (Cologne-Bonn Stuttgart and Hannover) but there are some really interesting onward destinations (such as Tenerife for which I just forked out £400 for an EasyJet flight-from-hell).

SKG-MUC-SKG done this trip several times. Amenities not expected on LCC. All baggage was free. Sandwiches refreshment coffee chocolate newspaper magazines pillow blanket etc all free. Staff friendly. Punctual departures. Free seat-allocation on web check-in (1st row). Plane clean seat space adequate.

### TUIfly customer review
Booked TUIfly from Stuttgart to Berlin. At the gate I had to find out that my flight will be with a 25 year old 737-300 from Hola Airlines. Dirty and really poor interior which was as old as the plane itself. As far as I got to know TUIfly will be using two planes from Hola Airlines until November. I would not recommend flying with them.

Tel Aviv to Berlin Tegel airport. Easy check-in friendly staff loads of leg room (we had normal seats not exit seats). Food was nothing to write home about but it was a night flight so didnt really care. Plane was clean. Would recommend and will be flying with them again. Great prices available.

Tel-Aviv-Cologne. Service on this flight was good. Although the airline is a LCC we were served a free meal. The cabin was spacious and ample leg-room. Shame you have to pay extra for an emergency exit seat.

### TUIfly customer review
Cologne-Hamburg return Boeing 737-800 and 737-700. This airline is a LCC so no free drinks or food. For 45 minute leg this is fine. Both flights late by around 15 minutes. Seat reservation via online booking cost 9 Euro per leg. Booked seat 1C on both legs an no problem with check in. Crew friendly offered free newspaper and some magazines. The seats are narrow and legroom is limited. Ticket cost EURO 145 so not that bad.

### TUIfly customer review
Recently travelled to LPA - booked and paid 46Euro for emergency exit seats for the leg room got the seats ok but they have no extra leg room - standard seats. On the way back they decided to land in Tenerife and pick up more passengers so 4 hours became 6! Watch out when booking - you pay for anything and everything - so much so that the only people who get coffee are those that have paid for breakfast. When I asked if I could buy a coffee was told No!

### TUIfly customer review
I booked two Tuifly flights in late August for November: DUS-KLU and CGN-INN. The departure times were changed for both flights in advance (3 hours earlier/ 6 hours later). Web check-in didn't work properly for one of the flights so that had to contact the desk at the airport. The staff was very unfriendly and not willed to print a real boarding pass. When I entered the security area a delay for an unknown reason was announced. In the end we were allowed to board the plane 3 hours later (no vouchers or anything else were handed out to the passengers). The seat pitch was miserable and the cabin was dirty - crew was unfriendly. All in all I can only say that I had a horrible feeling when I was on board a Tuifly plane.
