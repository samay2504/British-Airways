### "this was the worst experience"
If possible, avoid this airline at all costs. They are cheap but you truly get what you pay for, and then some with hidden costs. Not only do they try and upsell you 3x per each action you take making the purchasing process the worst ever, they also charge you to check in to your flight. They will automatically add on upsell options even when you don’t select them and need to go back several steps. If you can avoid doing it on mobile as it makes it even harder to avoid pop up upsells and eliminate them from your checkout. Avoid at all costs. It may be the cheapest option but after their hidden fees you may end up paying what you would for another flight. I rarely ever write reviews but this was the worst experience I’ve ever had flying on an airline and felt that I needed to warn others so they don’t go through the same as we had to.

### "check in process is geared to rip you off"
Not Verified |  Regrettably I should have read the reviews before making the booking. Whereas the aircraft and the crew is fine, the ground staff and check in process is geared to rip you off. If you want to e-check in do so at least a few hours before the flight else the portal will not let you do so. Three hours prior to the flight tried to do so but unable to. Got to the check in counter 1.50 minutes prior to the flight and informed a $50 equivalent charge to check in 4 of us as it was less than two hours to flight time. Of note there was no check in line. On our prior flight one of the ground stall tried to scare us in to take the express check in lest we miss flight. Thankfully we did not fall into that trap and the extra cost. They were unapologetic about the fact that as a low cost carrier they would try to extort you at every occasion.

### "$170 CAD for carry-on luggage"
Not Verified |  Worst Airline Ever! I will never fly with this airline again. I checked in online where it said I was allowed a carry-on and personal item. When I get to the gate they charged us $170 CAD per person for carry-on luggage! I was told if I did not pay I would not get on the flight. Didn't want to get stuck in Medellin! Paid almost as much for carry-ons as I did for the flight.

### "common sense and sensitivity really says a lot about a company"
Horrible experience, they gave my husband, my 13 yr old daughter and I separate seats, they had no option to confirm or buy seats online, only at the airport and after we checked bags and enter checkpoint noticed they had given us separate seats. I spoke to a flight attendant and they insisted we had to pay extra for seats like if that option was even available to start with, I asked to be seated just with my daughter and they say no, after we landed I saw the plane had 12 consecutive seats empty all the flight and they were not even courteous enough to offer from the beginning before even taking off from the airport. On my connecting flight I notice almost the entire plane was on the same situation, you guys don’t realize that you would have gotten more money even on the catering service and people would buy food and drinks if you were to seat them together, I did not have a very pleasant experience in the country and this was just like the cherry on the ice cream. Customer service is important and common sense and sensitivity really says a lot about a company.

### "Worst company"
Worst company. Never gonna take this company again, I should have look at the reviews before booking. Hate their service! The price can be good, but you’ll prefer any other companies, it’s a promise.

### "nickeled and dimed in every possible way"
Not Verified |  I can share a few cautionary anecdotes with you regarding Viva Air. It’s hard to understate the kindness, courtesy and helpfulness of every Colombian I’ve met in Medellin, Guatape and Santa Marta. That impression was tarnished when my husband and I presented our passports to the woman at the baggage drop desk. She told us that, contrary to the information I’d received from the platform on which I’d purchased our tickets, we were not checked in for our flight. However, the real problem was not that we’d arrived too late for our flight. The Viva representative informed us that she would not be able to allow us on the flight because we had arrived 13 minutes after the cut off time for check in. For check in?! Please note that this is a small airport where ordinarily, only 10 minutes are necessary to get from the entrance through security to the gate. But no matter how we pleaded our case, neither the woman behind the counter nor her bureaucratic martinet of a supervisor would budge. It was not merely that we were prevented from boarding our flight that we found upsetting; it was the way Viva’s staff treated us. At no moment did we receive a sympathetic word from anyone. When we tried to reschedule our flight, the supervisor coldly informed us that we’d have to fly out the following morning, then amended her statement a minute later. That flight was actually booked; maybe the next day. She was clearly anxious to dismiss us, impatient with our lack of fluency in Spanish. In addition to the chilly manners of its staff and its insistence on punctilious enforcement of its rules, Viva also qualifies as Colombia’s answer to the US’ Spirit Airlines. Prepare to be nickeled and dimed in every possible way. My husband has never had to pay extra for his very compact travel guitar on any of the many carriers he’s flown. Guess what. There’s a first time for everything. They were about to charge me for my yoga mat bag as well when out of shock, I dropped my water bottle and it broke spilling all over the floor. I didn’t plan it as a distraction— I really liked that water bottle, but it did save us another ridiculous fee.

### "they made me pay 120$ for one cart"
I bought ticket through Orbits. Chose one that said carry on free and first checked bag free! At the airport they made me pay 120$ for one cart on and one checked in bag. Total lie!

### "This airline is worse than Spirit"
This airline is worse than Spirit. When arrived to airport at Medellin to go to San Andres I am told my ticket was cancelled back in April but didn’t give me any reason. They said an email was sent to me but there was no refund on my account I didn’t get a call to make other arrangements. I got so upset because they are blaming me for this. I always purchase my tickets thru cheaptickets and never had a problem. The ticket still shows active at the cheaptickets website I can’t understand what happened. My flight was leaving at 11:13pm and instead they put me on another flight leaving at 1am in the morning. So I am waiting 6hrs to travel with a 5 year old and my husband. My two check in luggage were over the weight limit 8 pounds each and they still charged me $498 for the overages. They don’t deserve to be in business taking money from people.

### "customer service was terrible"
The worst of services. Let's start by saying that the airline does not send email to check in. By not doing it before, at the airport they charge you extra for doing it. As a consequence, they do not assign you seats and make you wait for the whole plane to board to see if there are any available, and if there is not, they send you on another flight. The customer service was terrible, of all the employees who have only one of them gave us a good service. They do not know how to explain how their policy works and/or express themselves correctly. First and last time flying with this airline  El peor de los servicios. Empecemos por decir que la aerolínea no envía email para hacer check in. Al no hacerse antes, en el aeropuerto te cobran adicional por hacerlo. Como consecuencia, no te asignan asientos y te hacen esperar que todo el avión aborde para ver si hay disponibles, y si no lo hay te mandan en otro vuelo. El servicio al cliente fue pésimo, de todos los empleados que tienen solo una de ellas nos prestó un buen servicio. No saben explicar cómo funciona su política y/o expresarse de forma correcta. Primera y última vez volando por esta aerolínea.

### "the last time I fly VivaAir"
VIP Boarding is a scam, VIP Seats are a scam. Too many flight cancellations without warning. Every question I ask, the response is “I don’t know”. Uncomfortable seats. Always super late, and they lie about being on time. I will stick to US-based airlines from now on. This is the last time I fly VivaAir.

### "never had to pay to check in"
Not Verified |  You have to pay for all in this company! First of all, you can't take cabin bags with unless you pay (but that I already knew before I bought it). Second, I tried to do the online check in the day before but the site wasn't working well (I had to change my birthday date because it was wrong and the button to change wasn't working), so I give up and decided to do the check in the airport. When I got there, they told me I had to pay 58,5 nuevo soles (more or less 15 euros or dollars) because I didn't do the online check in. Well, I've been traveling a lot in the last couple of years and I've known several airline companies, and I never had to pay to check in! Even more, I tried to explain the situation but it didn't help. I ask for the complaint book, which, once again, was not working well on the website, so they gave me a physical one. After I gave them the book, they answered right in the moment and said that they didn't seen in the system that I tried to do the check in (which I did!) and they even add that I bought the ticket through a travel agency (like if it was a problem). I'm very upset with this company and I don't advise anyone to fly with them!

### "don't choose Viva to fly"
Worst company ever, we booked a flight where the online check-in didn't worked. Charged us 15$ for every boarding pass when it was not our fault. Also, in the airport of Cusco they checked all the luggage which made all the persons to spent much more time than was expected on the check-in. Some of this persons needed to pay the express check-in line to avoid the cue and miss their flights. If possible don't choose Viva to fly.

### "have the worst customer service"
Viva Air is a low cost airline but be careful! They have the worst customer service. Cheap airlines have always the worst policies. I was charged $60.000 Colombian pesos, just to get a boarding pass printed, because it wasn’t sent in advance before the flight. What a rip off! I guess you get what you pay for

### "Don't travel with them!"
Not Verified |  A terrible company. They made a surbooking for a Flight that was supposed to leave at 6:30, but this one was 2 hours delayed and we were around 12 Persons not able to fly. No information given, nothing. Nobody knew how to help us. We were supposed to jump on a next flight 7:30pm or 8:30pm but they told us that we will not fly on that day but the next one. So you I was stuck in Mexico City, tired after all this thing, and no refund has been done. Don't travel with them!

### "many hidden prices"
Not Verified | Medellin to Miami. This airline is the worst airline I have ever flown. They have many hidden prices, the seats are very uncomfortable (worse than Spirit) their customer service is terrible and very careless. With everything you pay for this airline in extras, you pay for a much better one and even in first class. What a way to steal from people.

### "you still have to go to a counter"
Paid for all the extras, including the “we will do the check in for you” bs which is just a scam, for the tickets not to be delivered to your phone, and you still have to go to a counter. The fact that there wasn’t a single people in line when everyone else was busy, should have been telling, please stay away from this airline.

### "first and last time with Viva Air"
Not Verified |  This was my first and last time with Viva Air. There is something really wrong with how this low budget airline thinks when it comes to UX design and their Ethics on how they make money. It is incredible that I had booked a ticket for a short trip - 3 days for $270,000 Colombian pesos and ended up paying $600,000 in extras I "somehow agreed". Instead of me activating all the additional expenses as a personal choice (Extra bag, Printing tickets, Express line, Insurance, etc) all those were by default activated for me. It was "my responsibility" to check in detail page after page and make sure all of those were unticked. So after going through a process of reading carefully each page making sure you did not add by accident any additional unwanted and unnecessary additions, oh! surprised you ended up with a bill that is double the original ticket price. I understand you need to be careful when booking a low budget Ticket, but this is another level. This website was designed for people to make mistakes and then hide behind the Terms and Conditions policy making sure you pay for every single mistake made. After my mistake I immediately called the call centre to try to rectify it ... to my surprise I was received by a call centre agent prepared to shoot me with all their policies, procedures, terms and conditions as a learned script. Turns out they do not offer any customer refunds. This airline receives hundreds of complaints of people experiencing similar issues on a daily basis. Calls like mine are their constant, as their tricks work and people end up confused and do not untick one, two, or all 6 extra unnecessary features. It is not ok to know you have a system that is designed this way and still have the guts to pick up the phone and blame it on the user. This makes me sad, angry and frustrated. If this review prevents you from making the same mistake of doing business with this sort of unethical business at least this frustration will have a purpose. Extras should be unticked and people should decide what to add. I don't go to the supermarket with a cart full of stuff and on the counter start selecting what I don't want to take with me. That is not how business should work. Shame on you Viva Air.

### "told me that the flight was closed"
I was traveling from Cartagena Medellin, Medellin Miami and I got confused and arrived 10 minutes late to the desk and they told me that the flight was closed. They realized at that time that someone with my name was inside the plane, so they never page me. They have to hold the plane for more than half an hour to clarify that the person inside the plane have another name and no mine, and still they denied us. For that reason, we have to flight back to Miami with Spirit Airlines and paid more than $400 each for our tickets. Terrible airline, was my first and my last trip with them.

### "customer service was horrible"
Overcharged 2 Times The Cost of Fare. Our family of 4, used Viva Air for 2-way travel to and from Lima and Cusco. We were forced to pay, in an unfair and unjust manner. In addition the customer service was horrible and so was the airport and in-flight experience. Baggage check unfairly charged, from Lima to Cusco USD $160. Baggage check in unfairly charged, from Cusco to Lima USD $94. Flight change fare unfairly charged, from Cusco to Lima USD $60. Flight change negative balance not refunded - from Lima to Cusco USD 25 as well as from Cusco to Lima, that we should have been refunded To be clear, I am pursuing this matter with Viva for a refund. In addition, the flight experience was pathetic. No Customer Service – Both sides (Lima to Cusco) we were assigned random seats. We requested to be given at least 2 seats together so that one parent could sit with one child at least. However, your staff was insensitive and rude. They were forcing us to pay more money and ultimately refused to give us seats together. On the return journey, my daughter was sick and was throwing up – I tried to request the agent on the gate but she refused to support (even though the flight was about 50% occupied!). Bad comfort on flight - No water, no table space to keep even one book. No flight attendants checking on my daughter who was sick. No help during check-in (in fact trying to force us to buy faster check in access or else wait in line for 45 minutes! ).

### "my luggage never arrived"
After paying $70 to check my luggage, it never arrived at my destination. I filled out the paperwork with the attendant and tried to follow up with two emails that never received replies. I call them and the representative told me they’d contact me in five to seven days. It’s now been nine days and not a peep. They’ve basically stolen my luggage.

### "cannot re-iterate how awful they were"
Make sure you check in online before arriving at the airport or they will charge you $16 to check in. Do not be tempted to buy your ticket with an agency or third party when traveling with them as they will claim you have 'outstanding balance' and make you pay for it. I paid $99 for a checked bag, they claimed they didn't receive the payment, charged me a fine $65 at the airport in Bogota. On my return journey to they claimed my bag was included only for the outward journey, so now on return I have to pay another $65 fine to check my bag in. Overall I payed over $400 for a journey that wasn't worth it. The stress they caused is completely unacceptable. Again, cannot re-iterate how awful they were.

### "the worst airline ever"
This is the worst airline ever. They showed a price on the screen of about 300 Euros for a return flight between Cal and Santa Martha for two people. I specifically took care in not accepting any of the extra services they offered. My surprise comes when we received the email with the confirmation of the payment. It appears as if we have clicked yes to every extra additional service they offered and, we have requested it twice for every passenger. Now the price is 2 times higher. We contacted them immediately and at least five times later. The answer is always the same. Nothing can be done, if you cancel we give you a voucher minus taxes and administrative costs. Of note, the first employee who answered the call told us that their system was experiencing some problems. I read the reviews after, should have done before. Please avoid them.

### "A complete ripoff especially if you are a tourist"
I hope this helps anyone buying a ticket from this airline. Don't, they will rip you off. They charge a hidden fee at check-in. I got charged $240 for four tickets, because I missed the web check-in time. I told them I never received a email notification. They said it was in the fine print. Horrible service, they sat us all separate even though the flight wasn't packed. They charged for my carry-on although people had bigger ones. A complete ripoff especially if you are a tourist.

### "give us half the money"
What a sad day! We have tried so many attempts to resolve our situation. My mother died from COVID-19 and we had to cancel the trip, but they decided after two months to give us half the money and a voucher for the amount. This voucher is to be used within 12 months. It sickens me to know how evil these people are after knowing that no one has control of this virus, and it affected my family without warning.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
This is the worst airline I have ever flown. From the booking thru landing. There is little to no technology to expedite processes. I tried the online check-in process and it continuously failed. So I got charged a check in fee. The documentation required is not explained prior to boarding, so you spend a good half hour filling documents. The COVID verification process is duplicated time and time again. Why because it's written down, not entered into a system. To top it all off, I asked a question about the verification process and the clerk gave me the third degree. Complained to the supervisor who went on to give me a lecture. To top it all off I was hand selected for a special security process.

### "Ground service was terrible"
It was not my first trip with Viva nor my only ticket bought. I have made biz with then multiple times. But for my return fly Medellin to Miami for return on 07/05/21 @ 9:02 the staff was a pain and she wasn’t friendly. She decided to close the fly super early even as some of us vague for her help while waiting for the covid test results. Technically she closed the flight in my nose while I was holding the test in my phone and kept repeating flight is closed like 45 minutes before departure time. Ground service was terrible.

### "$30 dollars for my tiny carry on bag"
Not Verified |  I decided to give Viva air a second chance but it has been one of the biggest mistakes I’ve ever made. My last experience was horrible and after complaining I received vouchers for the tickets that I had purchased. It turns out that when paying taxes for those tickets it was pretty much like buying a new ticket. The customer service is horrible! When I got to the airport this time I expressed my concern about not being able to check in online and the answer that I got is that I made a mistake and I would have to pay $25 dollars for them to check us in. Then, I said that I had a small carry on suitcase to bring with me and their trick is that if your “personal item” doesn’t fit in the box that they have designed to measure your luggage you have to pay extra. Well, my bag was too big (for the box) and I ended up paying $30 dollars for my tiny carry on bag to be checked. Am I using this airline again? No way! T

### "This was a terrible experience"
This was a terrible experience. We had to return to our hotel because of some items left behind and tried to send our adult kids ahead of us knowing that we were going to miss our flight and the airline did everything they could to make this experience impossible. The lady helping them couldn’t have be any worse. We then bought tickets on Avianca and it was a very pleasant end to a bad day.

### "They issue only vouchers"
Not Verified |  Please do yourself a favor and save yourself a headache and losing money. Do not book on this airline! They are booking customers on flights, taking payment and days or a week later cancelling flights & rebooking passengers on flights on different days without consent. I confirmed with 3 Viva Air agents by telephone prior to booking these tickets that their flights were running on time and not being canceled. Each assured me the bookings on their online website were legitimate and safe to book. Then they cancel your flight and hopefully, you are fortunate to even find out that they have done so. Now they have your money and will not issue a refund. This is Viva Air problem, their mistake, which should be taken care of by Viva Air not put the burden on their customers. They issue only vouchers. What good is a voucher that we will never be able to use? What a rip off! Don't be the next victim.

### "cheap flights turn out to be expensive"
I searched on their website for two tickets one-way. The price for two was $40 more than buy them individually. I figure because we were going to sit next to each other. Well then I was charged extra for seat selection. When we arrived we were charge again 140000 COP to check in! Also, we were not give the seats next to each other and I was charge extra for this. Viva Air is simply a horrible company. They will not refund any of my money. They said it was my fault because I should have said something. Well being blind-sighted by additional fees, yes I did not noticed the seats were not next to each other. Over $150 additional fees. Their cheap flights turn out to be expensive.

### "intransigent and unethical"
Do not fly with Viva Air. I have traveled with quite a few agencies, but this is the most intransigent and unethical I know of on the market. Their economic cost does not compensate for the terrible service they offer. On the Lima to Cuzco route, my carry-on bag was measured and I was allowed to travel because the excess of 2 cm (seriously 2 cm) was from the suitcase design. Upon return, they made me remove the straps from the backpack because the manager happened to measure the excess with a ruler, leaving my backpack damaged. Wait a bit or pay a few more estimated dollars. No vuelen con Viva Air!! He viajado con bastantes agencias, pero esta es la más intransigente y poco ética que conozco del mercado. Su costo económico no compensa el pésimo servicio que ofrecen. En la ruta Lima a Cuzco se me midió la maleta de mano y se me permitió viajar porque el excedente de 2 cm (en serio 2 cm) era del diseño de la maleta. Al retorno, me hicieron desmontar los fierros de la mochila porque al encargado se le ocurrió medir con una regla ese excedente, quedando estropeada mi mochila. Esperen un poco o pague unos dólares más estimados

### "excuse to keep their customers’ money."
Viva Ar has recently cancelled my Lima-Cusco-Lima flights and issued me a voucher minus an administrative fee for the cancellation that they initiated! The voucher has a 180 day validity. They blame the Peruvian government's attempts to control the Covid-19 pandemic and completely ignored the following arguments: First, for Viva Air to charge an administrative fee for a cancellation that they have initiated is simply outrageous and in violation of standard airline practices. In fact, if an airline cancels flight because of bad weather or a disaster due to a tornado, for example, the standard and decent practice is to give customers a full refund for the moneys paid. The Covid-19 pandemic is actually worse than any weather disaster and a full refund is legitimately due. Second, for Viva Air to arbitrarily impose a 180 day limit on the use of the voucher under the uncertainties of the current pandemic conditions is not acceptable either. As the Peruvian experience of the last 5-6 months indicates, it s completely unpredictable when it would be possible for tourists to safely travel without risking their lives or well being. Specifically, there is no certainty about any of the following: (1) Whether some airports will be open or closed and when, and what other means of transportation will be available to tourists. In fact, air, train, and bus transportation has been prohibited for weeks, on and off, in most regions, provinces, and cities in Peru. (2) What travel restrictions will be imposed and what points of interests and attractions will be open or closed to the tourists. (3) What regions, provinces, or cities will be quarantined, when, and for how long. Not knowing this, tourists may be trapped in a quarantined place for weeks. (4) Peru is actually one of the countries with more severe problems due to the Covid-19 pandemic in South America. Thus, weekly repatriation flights for U.S. citizens and legal residents have been implemented since the pandemic started according to the U.S. Embassy in Lima and the State Department STEP (Smart Traveler Enrollment Program). This alone indicates that everything related to the Covid-19 pandemic is very unstable in Peru and it is impossible to plan any travel for an undetermined period of time. (5) How long the mandatory stay-at-home order for people 65 years old or older will last, or when it will be reinstated if lifted. This is something that may affect different regions, provinces, or cities at different times, imposing a severe displacement or travel restriction on any senior traveller or tourist. In fact, I am currently a 77 years old U.S. citizen and simply cannot travel under these circumstances. In brief, Viva Air owners and administrators are using the Peruvian government attempts to control the Covid-19 pandemic as an excuse to keep their customers’ money. This is one of the most disgusting, unfair, and unethical airline practices that could ever be implemented.

### "they refuse to refund us"
We were supposed to fly with VivaAir in May, but our flights were cancelled due to COVID-19. Even though under US International law they are obligated to give us a cash refund for flights they canceled, they refuse to refund us. They will only give us a voucher that has to be used in 6 months. Unacceptable. They are operating illegally, taking advantage of ignorant people, and a sham of a company. Do not let anyone you know fly with them.

### "They refused refunds"
I had 2 different tickets via Viva Air but all the flights were suspended by the government and I wasn’t able to take the flight. They refused refunds. They told me That they were going to give me a voucher and I have to use it until November. But also they gave me deadline to reschedule my flights. It is so funny that I have to rebook again until 30th May. I told them so many times that I’m not going to be in the area to use it again. And we don’t know how virus will be spread! I will never use this airlines. Be careful before you book your flight. The customer service is terrible.

### "they still refuse to refund"
Think twice before you book a ticket with Viva Air. I booked 3 tickets from Cusco to Lime for our tour in Peru. Viva Air first changes our flight times - but we could manage these times so we accept them. However, a few weeks later, Viva Air cancels our flight that day. We had to fly that day though, because our return flight to Europe was the following day. Although I requested refund from Viva Air via e-mail (it was not possible through their website), it took 3 weeks before they replied, and they constantly told me that they will give me a voucher, valid until November 2020. I told them on every occasion that I am not in Peru and cannot do anything with the voucher, they insisted that they will send me a voucher; they even stated that I requested a voucher via their website - which I definitely did not - and they did send me a voucher. I have now roughly sent 75 e-mails to Viva Air, but they still refuse to refund the money. I was in contact with the local authorities, but in order to start a case against Viva Air, I have to present myself in person with all documents ... Peruvian bureaucratie ... I still did not get any indication that Viva Air will refund my 200 US Dollar, so I would recommend passengers to book tickets at LATAM instead of Viva Air.

### "it's just really dishonest"
In terms of the actual flying experience, the planes themselves are relatively new (at least the ones I flew in), I found there to be sufficient legroom, they were very clean and even comfortable. They tended to arrive and depart on time and there were minimal disruptions here. The problem lies within: 1) Booking anything on the website and; 2) Making any small misstep along your journey. I work in digital design and UX and like to think of myself as quite adept when it comes to booking flights online, either on my laptop or mobile. Until I needed to book flights with Vivaair. It works by automatically sticking on all these little extras through their "Combo++" packages, confuses you to the point where you don't know what you have paid for (they have these three packages which come pre-selected, or you can handpick your extras, and oftentimes "inadvertently" making you double up). I had to start again many times over, as it just became so convoluted - obviously intentionally designed to confuse you. Vivaiar's booking system is at best misleading (not to mention unethical) and makes Ryanair's website seem like a walk in the park. I just hate to think of the number of people it has conned out of their money this way which I'm sure is part of their business model. 2. So maybe this was partially my fault, I'm not sure. On one occasion I had to pay a proportionately hefty penalty for not having checked-in online and doing this at the airport instead. Fair enough. The second, was when at the time of my booking, I selected check-in luggage instead of extra carry-on luggage and paid a premium for this (my luggage was actually just a standard carry-on sized suitcase, I just had a backpack on me as well). On the day I arrived quite early to the gate. The staff at the desk here (who I struggled to communicate with in Spanish or English) made me aware that there was an issue, as I had not checked-in my bag. He said he would come back and rectify this for me (to which I was oblivious at the time), as he gestured for me to sit down. He, of course, never returned, and I was forced to pay £60 for this misdemeanour (this is in Colombia, mind you.). I would have been ok to pay a small fee as it was a misunderstanding on my part .. but £60 is enough to pay for one night at a very good hotel in the capital. Finally, one of my flights was cancelled from Lima to Bogota due to the COVID-19 crisis and government borders closing down. Vivaair sent me an email to say that this flight was cancelled (as expected), as Peru had already shut down all air traffic. Once I was back in London, I spoke to one of the customer service agents via their chat service about requesting a refund for this cancelled flight. The response I received was from their agent was "Sorry refunds aren't allowed. Any flights can('t) be refunded, besides the flight was not cancel(ed) by the airline, it was cancelled by the airport". Not to mention that I had to reconnect to the chat so many times, as the moment it takes you to the front of the queue, it gives you a mere few seconds until you are automatically disconnected sent to the back of the line. All in all, I now know why I was warned against this airline - it's just really dishonest and should really be called up on it.

### "$50 for each carry on bag"
Cusco to Lima. Worst airline ever. They charged us $50 for each carry on bag on the way there and on the way back. That’s including  our personal items. Charged $50 for carrying a fanny pack! Ridiculous!

### "cI would not recommend it"
Cusco to Lima. Viva Air are supposed to be the most affordable airline but charge you for absolutely everything. We didn’t check in online 24hrs before (we don’t have data and we’re on an overnight bus) so had to pay 177 Soles ($80AUD) just to check in... I have never heard of this before. They purposely don’t seat you with your companions and then say if you’d like to change seat to be with your loved ones you can do so for an extra cost. I had a spare seat next to me and asked if my boyfriend could sit with me and he said only for extra cost... again I have never ever been on an airline that does such a thing. We weren’t given a complimentary beverage, we needed to pay for any refreshment. The ground staff were also very rude and unhelpful. This airline sucks and I would not recommend it.

### "it wasn't worth it"
Not Verified |  Got the cheapest tickets with Viva Air. I knew I chose Economy but for all the hassle it wasn't worth it. Very Long Queues, very unhelpful staff on the check in area. Had to pay loads of money just to seat near the 3 children travelling with me, then an even bigger amount to have the boarding pass re-printed (as my copy wasn't from a laser printer!!). Even though I had downloaded the tickets to my phone (as per their web-site), apparently they don't run that service!! All and all was just as expensive or more than any other bigger airline company.

### "only 20kg checked luggage"
Lima to Bogotá. The worst airline and entirely rip off. They allow only 20kg checked luggage. This is the most stressful and inconvenient airline we have discovered. It’s all about money grabbing airline. They do not think about travellers but just charging money for every single opportunity.

### "worst airline I’ve ever flown"
Lima to Cuzco. This is the worst airline I’ve ever flown. It’s almost like they try to be the worst. They charged us 130 Soles just to check infor the flight, which was the cost of the flight itself. The customer service is abysmal, the guy at the counter walked away with our change, another clerk had to call him to get him to come back. I’m pretty sure he was just hoping we’d leave and he’d keep the change. Their business model is offer cheap flights then scam you for all you’re worth.

### "families are not sat together"
Not Verified |  Santa Marta to Medellin. How is it possible that families are not sat together. Empty airplane and they only have emergency seats to sit us together for an extra charge. So rude and want to charge for everything.

### "This is the worst airline"
Bogotá to Santa Marta. This is the worst airline I have ever flown, their customer service is so poor and bad I have not words. They will charge even for a check in, their web site is trash, couldn’t use the check in and they blame me for it. They  broke one of my suitcases and they said they are not responsible for any damage. I am so upset.

### "never book with them again"
Not Verified |  Lima to Talara. Easy to book the ticket online and cheap but you get what you paid for. They charge a lot for checked baggage which made the final cost of the flight close to it's competition. Customer service is clueless and needs to maybe smile more. Flight ended up being cancelled. Peruvians sprinted to the check in line and basically had a riot. Staff couldn't communicate a thing which definitely would help. I kept getting bump back in line even though I went to the counter shortly after the cancellation. People were insane. No control from ur staff just useless people. There was no direction .. no signs defining lines. People catching different flights would come to the line up and stand their thinking it was their flight .. we were the ones telling them what line up/counter they should go to. Why isn't Viva Air staff explaining anything to anyone. After a 5 hour wait in a line of crazy people our flight was rescheduled to the following day. The new flight was terrible, people threw up including myself and I fly often with no issues. We've booked 3 more flights while in Peru.. Not one is with Viva Air. We will never book with them again.

### "read their website"
Not Verified |  Miami to Medellin. Viva air is a low cost airline. You have to read their website. Their website states very clearly the additional fees you can encounter. You can only take 1 free bag with specific measurements and weight 10kg. If you go over in measurement or weight, they charge a fee. Their carry on is not free and the checked is not free either. They let you change seats free, if there is empty seats. My total flight including 1 checked bag for each flight was 413$ for two people. My husband and I shared a 20kg checked bag. We took our backpacks for dirty clothes and for additional last minute travel purchases. I had compared my airline prices AA = 373$ per person Avianca =414$ per person However, I am leaving a 3 star because our flight back to Miami from Medellin was a bit stressful the check in process was very disorganized and the lady gave us separate seats. But I was able to switch seats when we boarded the flight.

### "not sent  a reminder email"
Santa Marta to Medellin. At the bottom of several pages of small print on e-ticket, Viva Air states ‘not submitting a printed boarding pass at the airport for domestic flights will incur a charge of $33.000.‘ Viva Air does not sent out a reminder email before travel. I assumed I could check in at the airport and was charged $65.000 (rather than $65). This strikes me as a cowboy practice.

### " worst airline I have ever flown"
Juliaca to Lima. The worst airline I have ever flown with! Terrible service, they try to charge every possible penny out of their clients. I have travelled with my backpack all over the world and never had any problems, not even with low cost such as RyanAir. I had to pay US$36 to travel using the same backpack I have been using for years, and that was not even for shipping but for carrying it the overhead compartment. Such a rip off! The flight was late, the plane was dirty, I don't recommend them for anybody and I for sure will never give them another penny!

### Viva Air customer review
Santa Marta to Bogota. Had the misfortune of booking flights with Viva Air. Their business model is clearly designed to catch out people and sting them with extra-large unreasonable fees. I bought tickets, and couldn't web check-in in advance and so got stung by fees over half the cost of the ticket just to get access to my tickets. How the hell they can sell tickets but then charge extra to access them is pathetic!. It cost me 715000 cop or approx 350 au for them to issue me tickets! Also, the people in front had one carry on bag that was literally 1 cm protruding out of the bag size and they had to pay for checked luggage - 1cm! Furthermore, at the airport, the supervisor started raising their voice at us, especial to a 70-year-old in our group and then they simply walked off leaving us at an unattended service counter. You could not find an airline with worse customer service and ethics!. I hope their reputation and service (lack of) is their downfall, they don't deserve to be in business!

### "service is poor to miserable"
Flight Bogotá Lima. Reclining chairs, but barely room for my legs in the chair (I measure 1.75). I had to pay extra to sit next to my wife. All the time in fear that the bags we carry would be extra charged. Cuzco Lima Not even a USB port to charge cell phone or tablet. Everything, including water is charged. Plastic chairs that do not recline, just better than those on an urban bus. My wife changed position with a woman since she had been separated from her 5 year old son. Lima Bogotá We had to pay 40 us for printing 2 passports. The same fear that the suitcase will be charged extra for passing us a couple of centimeters. Plastic chairs do not recline, for a 3-hour flight. I did not sit next to my wife, for not paying extra. If they could, they would charge the toilet paper per square. Really awkward. I understand that it is low cost, but the service is poor to miserable. No screen, no usb port, no water, no space, no comfort. Everything has to pay extra. In the end, it ends up leaving at the same price or even more expensive than better airlines like Lan or Avianca. Vuelo Bogotá Lima. Sillas que reclinan, pero apenas espacio para mis piernas en la silla (mido 1.75). Tuve que pagar extra para sentarme al lado de mi esposa. Todo el tiempo con miedo de que las maletas que llevavamos fueran a ser cobradas extra. Cuzco Lima. Ni siquiera un puerto usb para cargar celular o tableta. Todo, incluyendo agua es cobrado. Sillas plásticas que no reclinan, apenas mejores que las que hay en un bus urbano. Mi esposa cambio puesto con una mujer ya que habia quedado separada de su hijo de 5 años. Lima Bogotá. Tuvimos que pagar 40 us por imprimir 2 pasabordos. El mismo miedo de que la maleta la cobraran extra por pasarnos un par de centímetros. Sillas plásticas.no reclinan, para un vuelo de 3 h. No me senté al lado de mi esposa, por no pagar extra. Si pudieran, cobrarían el papel higieníco por cuadrado. Realmente incómodo. Entiendo que es bajo costo, pero el servicio se pasa a miserable. No pantalla, no puerto usb, no agua, no espacio, no comodidad. Todo toca pagar extra. Al final, termina saliendo al mismo precio o incluso más caro que aerolíneas mejores como lan o Avianca.

### "didn’t let me board"
Lima to San Andres via Bogota. We arrived on time to the flight. Right before boarding they told me I had to validate my boarding pass. I waited where she told me. There was a group in front of me paying their instruments. I was never attended. Then they closed the door and didn’t let me board. The worst thing is that the lady wrote in her computer that we refused to pay for our luggage and that’s why we didn’t board, which was false.

### "Terrible service"
Not Verified |  We flew with the same airline from Bogotá to Santa Marta and received all our bags without problem, since they complied with the established measures, and today when we show up to fly from Santa Marta to Bogotá they tell us that the same suitcase does not comply with the measures established by the airline and we must pay $ 80,000COP to return the suitcase to Bogotá. They also told us that they were not responsible for the "negligence", which they say the workers in Bogotá had when they received the suitcase, and finally they did not fix us and we had to pay. Terrible service of the airline Viva Air Colombia. Volamos con la misma aerolínea de Bogotá a Santa Marta y nos recibieron todas las maletas sin problema, ya que cumplían con las medidas establecidas, y hoy cuando nos presentamos para volar de Santa Marta a Bogotá nos dicen que la misma maleta (la cual es de pasta y no se puede modificar su tamaño) no cumple con las medidas establecidas por la aerolínea y que debemos pagar $80.000COP para poder devolver la maleta a Bogotá. También nos dijeron que ellos no se hacían responsable de la "negligencia", que según ellos, tuvieron los trabajadores en Bogotá al recibir la maleta, y finalmente no nos solucionaron y nos tocó pagar. Pésimo servicio de la aerolínea Viva Air Colombia

### "never got the promised refund"
I was forced to cancel my trip to Peru and claim on my insurance. Viva Air offered me a full refund, so this flight was not claimed on my insurance. I never got the promised refund, only excuses. 7 months on and I have still have not had the money returned to me.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Not Verified |  Lima to Bogota. I had to buy a brand new ticket at the airport because they messed up my booking. Not only did they refuse to refund me for that flight but also when I tried to have my tax refunded for the flight I didn't take (which you can do by law) they said I took the flight and the new ticket I bought had been changed to the flight I took (even though I paid the exact same price again at the airport). Worst customer service I've ever experienced. Avoid at all costs and spend more money on a better company if you can.

### "What a rollercoaster"
Medellin to Bogotá. 1. Can’t believe in 2019 an Airline charges people $11usd for a boarding pass print-out! When they can scan through my phone or even create an app! Scam scam scam! 2. Had to rearrange my baggage because I was over my 1KG! 3. I had booked through a third party and paid for checked in baggage. However, was told my ticket didn’t include baggage and had to pay. I was rushing for my flight and left with no choice, even though I showed them proof of my booking. 4. The flight was a constant prayer until I arrived. What a rollercoaster!

### "barred from boarding"
Lima to Arequipa. Most expensive budget flight I've ever seen. Hidden fees, denied entry to flight, left luggage. To make a long story short, there is a required fee of 45 PEN per person, just to print the boarding pass at the airport. For our party, it meant an additional $150 (USD). We paid it anyway, desperate to get to our destination. At boarding, one woman began to complain loudly about the bad treatment from the staff, and others joined in. My husband and a few others were barred from boarding for being too loud. Our only suitcase was paid for by my father, and should have been in his name, but they removed it from the flight because my husband wasn't boarding, without informing anyone. So we got to the destination, but the suitcase was left at the first airport. We were informed that the only way to recover it was to fly back and get it ourselves.

### "rude employees and managers"
I bought a ticket to Cusco from Lima using Kwiki. The night before my flight, Kwiki emailed me my e-ticket. I had no access to a printer. I went up to the customer service counter for Viva Air and asked the rep if I could use my Mobile e-ticket and she informed me it had to be printed and they could print it for 86 soles. I showed her my Kwiki confirmation email from the night before and informed her that it wasn't written on it and she said there was nothing she could do about it. I asked to speak to the manager. I spoke to the manager and showed her the confirmation and the e-ticket and she stated that it's not on the confirmation, it's on the e-ticket. She then said if I didn't want to pay 50 soles per person for them to print it, I would need to leave the airport and go look for a printer and come back before my flight left! How rude!! What kind of manager says something like that to a customer? There was clearly a discrepancy between what was on the e-ticket and the confirmation. I informed her that I only got the e-ticket the night before and showed her the date on the email and didn't have access to a printer in Lima. Her answer was " Well that means you've had at least 24 hrs to figure out how to print it. I don't know who taught this manager customer service skills, but if you want to be treated poorly by an airline, then fly viva air. I can more than afford the cost to print the ticket, but the way she handled the situation was absolutely horrible and ridiculous. Not only was she rude, but the employees who were near her were rude as well and started talking badly about my companion and I. They didn't realize that I understand enough Spanish to make out what some of the things they were saying. To make matters worse, when I asked the manager for the contact information for corporate, she told me she didn't know and couldn't give it to me. Stay far away from this airline and their rude employees and managers!

### "Terrible experience"
Not Verified |  Cusco to Lima. Terrible experience. I bought a ticket for $53, and paid extra fees for $75. The first few was a checking fee, due to not printing my own. The second fee was for an extra carry on. The “additional carry on” was a 12 inch tube used to carry paintings. It was the only item in the over head, since my purse was in my lap. My husband flew with Latam and later Avianca, his overall expenses were mush less. Do not fly with this airline, the cheaper costs are not real.

### "nickel and dime at every single point"
Miami to Medellin. They advertise "additional services" prices on their website, such as adding carry on baggage to a flight (included with most other airlines), that are cheaper when booked online versus at the airport but their website will not process these purchases so you end up forced to pay exorbitant fees at the airport and they do not honor any of their advertised prices even if the systems show that you tried to process the request online and over the phone in the time frame allowed by their policies. It's downright unethical to advertise a price and not honor it. They refuse to help over the phone, by chat, by email, or in person, and there is conveniently never a supervisor available to escalate any concerns. You will end up frustrated and paying more money than other airlines once they add all the fees. Even beverages on board international flights are at a fee. They nickel and dime at every single point.

### "baggage cost was excessive"
Juliaca to Lima. Worst airline ever. Charged me £20 to print my boarding pass. Also the cabin baggage cost was too excessive. I am used to travelling in no frills airlines in Europe, but this was the most excessive and purely intentional fleecing.

### "refuses to refund luggage fees"
Cartagena to Medellin. I can understand airlines and non-refundable ticket, but not refunding the extra charges such as luggage when you cancel a flight is ridiculous. I had to cancel the flight with Viva Air because the schedule did not work out. I had prepaid the luggage fees, but this cheap airline refuses to refund luggage fees if you cancel or do not use the ticket. I understand a non-refundable airline ticket, but not giving back the extra charges is damn stingy.

### "worst company I’ve ever dealt with"
Hands down the worst company I’ve ever dealt with in my life. I booked a ticket from Lima to Barenquilla with a connection in Bogota. Paid extra for hold luggage / fast lane boarding on both. Got to Bogota only to find our luggage on the caracel. It shouldn’t have been there. We were told at check in it would be transferred automatically to our second flight (in line with what we paid for). Ran to check in and were told check in was closed so we could not get on the flight. This is despite explaining that it’s clearly their fault. We wouldn’t have even gone to check in if our bags had been transferred correctly. They said “no you’re late” then said we’d have to buy another flight ourselves tomorrow. No discounts, no refunds, no hotel accommodation for tonight. Not even an apology. After complaining for 20 mins we were told we could take the bags through as hand luggage but would have to pay £104. We did, had no choice, would have cost more for a new flight + hotel. We’ve asked for our money back but they won’t respond to my emails. Unbelievably bad service from this awful company. - They sell you connecting flights but mistakenly put your bag on the carousel at the wrong airport - They don’t admit their mistakes and will charge you for every error they make - Plus they’ll happily make you pay £104 (more than the flight) or you’ll have to buy a whole new flight plus accommodation. Also they: - Purposefully sit people apart to force you to pay for seats (don’t fly if you’re a family) - Charge you £50 to get your boarding pass printed at check in. - Won’t transfer you onto a new flight if your connection is delayed. Do not fly with them if you have to take a connection. At best you’ll have to pay £104 and sprint with 15kg bags across the airport. At worst you’ll have to buy an entire new flight + hotel + pay for luggage again.

### "Worst experience ever"
Tarapoto to Lima. Worst experience ever! Do not fly Viva Air. To begin, we had to fly standby on the way out because they overbooked the flight and then they blamed us. On the way back, after paying extra for selected seats, extra for baggage, we were required to pay extra for a printed ticket even though my reservation said completed. Corruption at its worst. Do not support Viva Air!

### "rip you off at checkin"
Not Verified |  I have taken over 30 flights in the last 18 months and this one has created the strangest policies designed to rip you off at checkin. I had downloaded my ticket to my phone as I don’t always have a printer handy. Therefore I was charged 12 USD for a printed ticket that I never saw but I was handed a boarding pass. Next was the most interesting. I always travel with cabin baggage only that weighed 8:2kg. Checkin stipulated 10kg maximum. I thought great, I’m under. As I reach checkin the VivaAir employee grabs my bag and goes to the size stand and tries to shove my Universal cabin sized bag that has never been a problem to fit in the overhead cabins on any airline and says no it won’t fit. I thought no it’s not going to fit in that. So I was charged 69 USD to take my bag as cabin luggage and it would have been a few more dollars if I opted to check it in. This flight cost me in Australian dollars an extra $100 at check in. Be warned.

### "rescheduled without notification"
Not Verified |  Worst company ever! Flight was rescheduled for 10 hours earlier without notification and we missed it! The other flight from Medellin to Cusco got also rescheduled 3 times without notification. First promise to refund then deny it always in a written format. Will never fly with this company! Avoid it!

### "Worst airline ever"
Cartagena to Bogota. Worst airline ever, very bad customer service and they will charge extra money for absolutely everything. Printing the boarding pass (they do not provide copies on pdf or email), seats (there were no free seats anywhere in the cabin whole plane and all of them are cheap seats) even small luggage that fits on the overhead compartment and that is accepted on all airlines, they have smaller measures and will end up charging extra for luggage. This is not a cheap airline, they just deceive customers to rip them off at the airport.

### "Worst airline ever"
Cusco to Lima. Worst airline ever. Before we even arrived in Peru they changed our flights twice, as much as a day so our whole tour was effected. Today our flight was cancelled and only option given was later tonight so we missed our connection to Iquitos which affects our Iquitos hotel Booking and Amazon tour. They offered free lunch and hotel. The hotel we couldnt arrange until lining up in Lima airport al over again. Zero information. We have had to book another airline for 6 people so we can make our Amazon tour. Absolutely furious!

### "flight got rescheduled"
We booked a flight from Cusco to Medellín which took us 3 times longer than it should have. Our flight got rescheduled two days before from Cusco - Lima - Medellín to cCusco - Lima - Bogota - Medellín, which prolonged our traveling time from 6 hours to 15 hours. Delayed twice, which almost made us miss one of the connection flights. They also charge you 50 sol if you don't print your boarding pass. Even if they change your flight last minute. Don't hope for support or retribution because you will get none.

### "never fly this airline again"
Took 2 flights which have left me in no doubt that I will never fly this airline again. Our first was Pereira to Santa Marta. At check-in my wife's regulation cabin bag was deemed too large (by 5 cms) & would cost in excess of £20 to place in the hold. This bag has met the requirements of every other airline we have flown with (and that is many). The assistant was at least ready to offer an option - transfer all the contents & the bag into our hold baggage as they were under-weight. This we did, not without some inconvenience & embarrassment as our belongings spread across a very crowded & restricted check-in floor. The second flight was from Cartagena to Bogota. This time pre-warned about baggage we fell foul of another Viva rule. Travelling around Colombia it had not been possible to print our boarding passes, the penalty - £18 to have the check-in desk print them for us, totally unsympathetic to our situation. So be warned if flying with Viva Air, which we will certainly not be doing again.

### "this feels like a scam"
Bogota to Pereira. I was charged as much as the ticket cost because my 5kg backpack was 5cm too tall. It ended up fitting perfectly fine in length in the baggage bins, I have travelled all over the world with this same backpack on many different low cost airlines. For me this feels like a scam.

### travel with another airline"
Cartagena to San Andres. They never sent us mail or warned that we had to print the tickets in advance, or they would charge us 34,000 cops (12usd) to print the tickets. It had never happened to me to be charged for printing tickets at the AIRPORT. In addition to that we were charged the tax to enter the island, which was a mistake for not having set us in a blog, although I maintain that they must also warn the amount when making the purchase of the ticket. The worst part is that they do not accept a credit card to pay a tax. Where that money goes, I do not know. Yes or yes cash 112,000cop (40usd) Bad attention. For the money they charge you, it's better to travel with another airline. ES:  Nunca nos mandaron mail ni avisaron que debíamos imprimir los pasajes con antelación, o nos cobrarían 34.000 cops (12usd) por imprimir los boletos!!! Nunca me había pasado que me cobren por imprimir unos boletos en el AEROPUERTO. Ademas de eso nos cobraron el impuesto para entrar a la isla, que eso fue un error nuestro por no habernos fijado en algún blog, aunque sostengo que también deben avisar el importe al realizar la compra del pasaje. Lo peor de todo es que no aceptan tarjeta de crédito para pagar un IMPUESTO. A donde va ese dinero, no lo se. Si o si efectivo 112.000cop (40usd) Pésima atención. Por la plata que te cobran me conviene viajar con otra aerolínea mejor.
