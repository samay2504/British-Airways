### “incredible service”
REX have always been professional, I never took much notice of airlines, I just know who I will no longer fly with. In my recent trip with REX the light bulb went on. I understood the Guest ethos that had been taught to me through employment as a driver for luxury travel. With REX I finally "got it", the Guest Experience. No other airline has made me feel this elusive 'Guest' experience. I've had some absolute shockers, I am now a nervous flyer. Not a heart string pull - try flying home with your step sons ashes and being treated poorly in the USA, which you are transiting through. Suffice to say, I hate flying. This recent trip, I engaged brain, I saw it and was the recipient of their incredible service. The thing that makes airline travel easy, seamless, safe - treat people with respect. Don't immediately treat then with disrespect because of a judgement. And this is REX.

### "he went over and beyond"
Our flight from Auckland was late leaving due to bad weather. We arrived at the REX counter in Melbourne flustered and tired. The check in for baggage had just closed but Thomas came to our rescue. He checked if our baggage could still be checked in, escorted us through security down to the REX gate arriving with minutes to spare before the flight was called. With out Thomas we would never have made it, he went over and beyond to ensure we were able to make the flight. Thomas is a credit to himself and REX. The cabin crew had no idea we were weary travellers. We were greeted warmly and genuinely, thankful to have made the flight for home. To the REX staff, thank you. This is why we always fly REX.

### "enough leg room"
Being first time flyers with Rex, we were delighted with the personal service at airports and in the air. Assisted with booking in, luggage and seating details. Being tall, enough leg room to be comfortable. We would choose to fly rex whenever possible.

### "most reliable airline"
Our team fly weekly and we reckon Rex are the most reliable airline in Aus. Boarding is easy, flights are on time, crew are great. WiFi on all flights would seal the deal. Yet to be disappointed,

### "excellent customer service"
Not Verified |   Fantastic service, from bag drop to landing and getting my baggage on the other end. All staff played their role in providing the excellent customer service. It was an early morning flight and it was really nice to start the day on the right track!

### "very pleasantly surprised"
We are long-time members of another airline's frequent flyer program and lounge, but ion this occasion chose Rex at the 11th hour as it was the only airline that hadn't hiked its fares dramatically for the last couple of days before departure. We were very pleasantly surprised (for want of a better term). Despite costing us less than half what the competitors were offering, the service was exemplary. On needing a booking matter checked and dealt with by customer service I was very happy to find myself speaking to someone local who understood the exact situation and fixed it quickly and easily. The airliner itself was modern, clean and well presented, staff were friendly and relaxed. We also won a bid to get bumped up to business class, which was a first! Can't fault Rex - we will fly them again in the near future.

### "a truly great experience"
Second time we have flown Rex and it is now our go to airline. Staff, service and on time performance were exemplary. It is in everyone’s interest to support Rex in the interests of competition. But the efforts of their staff make for a truly great experience, miles ahead of any other airline in the country!

### "personal and professional service"
Not Verified |   Rex Airlines is a standout in terms of professionalism and helpfulness. Their call centres are here in Australia, staffed by knowledgeable and problem solving women (sorry men, I have just dealt with amazing women). Rex is our airline of choice when it flies where we need to go. It is hands down better than the other airlines based in Australia and is a reminder that an airline can work well and treat customers with personal and professional service.

### "extremely kind gesture"
A very big shout out to Jude and Liz at the check-in service desk, as well as Tup the client manager on the flight. I happened to leave a bag containing a priceless religious item at the check-in desk as we were running late for the flight. And in my haste I left the bag at the desk. I totally forgot about it and would have been extremely devastated and upset if I realised I left it behind. Once we boarded the plane and settled in, a very kind Tup and other staff member came up to us and returned the bag to us!! I can only guess that Liz and Jude realised I was a religious Jew and made the effort to return the bag to us on the plane before it took off! My wife and I were so touched by this extremely kind gesture. We spoke to Tup during the flight and expressed our gratitude but I wanted to leave this note of thanks to Jude and Liz too. We always try and fly Rex, your staff are friendly and happy, so different to the other airlines we have flown on domestically. And this incident just reinforces the good vibes we get when flying Rex.

### "experience really was good"
Took a trip recently travelling from Sydney to Melbourne on Rex Airlines new intercity jet service. It was a chance to test out their new service having many years ago flown on a regional flight to a country NSW town. A couple of standouts were immediately obvious starting with the check in staff and process at Terminal 2 in Sydney. Not only were the kiosks easy to use for check in but on proceeding to the desk for bag drop the staff were very friendly and helpful. On board the planes have good legroom and it was nice, although a short flight to at least get a snack and cup of coffee. Then on the return leg had to change my flight to an earlier time and again the service stood out. The call centre reservations staff member was delightful. There was no robot at the end of the phone and they cared about helping make changes. Everything about the experience really was good old fashioned country service with a smile. It really sets them apart from their competitors.

### "kindness and exceptional service"
Not Verified |   I inadvertently booked a flight for tomorrow when I was actually running late for my flight today. This situation could have been a travel nightmare, but the amazing girls at Rex Airlines turned it into a heartwarming story of kindness and exceptional service. Upon realizing my mistake and lateness, the girls from Rex Airlines went above and beyond to assist me. Without any hesitations or fees, they changed my flight to the same day, ensuring I could make it to my destination without any additional hassle. This act of flexibility and understanding was a first in my 53 years of flying experience, and it left a lasting impression on me. What truly stood out was not just their efficiency but also their warmth and sense of humor. Despite the late hour, the girls maintained a cheerful demeanor, even sharing a few light-hearted jokes to ease the situation. Their genuine care and friendliness made the entire experience delightful and heartwarming. Moreover, the comfort of the planes and the exceptional service from the entire staff further elevated my journey with Rex Airlines. The level of care and attention to detail demonstrated by the staff was truly commendable and made me feel valued as a passenger. Rex Airlines will be my preferred choice for all my future travels. The exceptional service, comfortable planes, and amazing staff have won me over completely. Thank you, Rex Airlines, for turning what could have been a stressful situation into a memorable and delightful experience. In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Rex Airlines to anyone seeking a top-notch travel experience.

### "Boarding not regulated"
Boarding not regulated, people boarding from the front having to cross those boarding from the back. It would be simple I believe to set up a process by seat numbers to avoid this type of shamble.

### “staff just can’t do enough”
Not Verified | Recently we flew to Sydney from Brisbane and back to Brisbane after going on a cruise. The travel agent booked us on Rex, we were a bit unsure about it knowing that Rex was predominantly a regional airline. But we have now found our new 1st choice airline, everything about the airline is top notch from the early notifications to pleasant and helpful staff at the luggage check in. The staff just can’t do enough to ensure your trip is smooth and enjoyable their new 737-800 jets are spacious and comfortable, you don’t feel like you’re being herded onto a cattle truck. The departure time was on time and arrived on time at the other end. Their slogan is our heart is in the country and it just feels like good old country hospitality. Keep up the good work guys, you give the other big airlines a run for their money.

### “amazing customer service”
Not Verified | Have to praise Regional Express (Rex) on their amazing customer service with both their ground and flight staff! It was so nice to be met by smiling faces, polite (even with a sense of humour!). I was also lucky enough to get an upgrade to a seat with extra legroom. After having absolutely dismal service recently from Jetstar and Qantas, it was nice to know that Customer Service from an airline still exists. Thanks Rex!

### “customer service is exceptional”
Absolutely love this airline! The best airline in Australia, I dare say. Ground staff are extremely helpful and nice, and flight attendants are just lovely: they will do anything to make sure you feel appreciated and welcomed onboard. Their customer service is also exceptional.

### "Reliable, on time, comfortable"
Not Verified |  First time flying Rex and won't be the last. Reliable, on time, comfortable, great price that includes baggage and an in-flight snack but most of all exceptional service. Sean in Adelaide went above and beyond to welcome everyone and help wherever possible. All staff were friendly and helpful. Best experience flying out of Adelaide in a while and will definitely fly with them whenever I travel interstate. Highly recommend.

### “Clean aircraft and efficient service”
Not Verified | Both flights on time. Easy online checkin and friendly customer services. We bid to upgrade on both flights and received our upgrades. Disappointing that we could not enter the lounge for a coffee but it is in the T&C so what do you do! Clean aircraft and efficient service. We would definitely consider Rex again.

### "how poor the support was"
I have been flying rex for a while. They offer an option to bid for upgrade to business which up until recently included access to the lounge at Sydney. But apparently it no longer includes that, but they fail to mention this in the advertisements they email you. When I found out I asked to cancel my upgrade bid and was refused saying I should have read small print Terms and Conditions. Changing the product, not telling people about it, and refusing to do anything about it is really disappointing. The airline itself is normally fine, but how poor the support was in this experience worries me alot.

### “Cabin Crew were first class”
First time my wife and I have flown with Rex Airlines. The Rex Airlines lounge in Sydney is very pleasant. The flight was on time and the Cabin Crew were first class and service was excellent. We will definitely fly with Rex Airlines again. Highly recommended. Hopefully, they will open a lounge in Brisbane soon.

### "won't fly any other carrier"
I fly between Melbourne and Sydney for work every week. I've flown Qantas, Virgin, Jetstar and Rex in the two years or so I've been with my current workplace. Rex offers Qantas levels of service at Jetstar prices. The flights include a small snack and free tea/coffee/water which is only matched by Qantas (if memory serves) despite often being the lowest or very near lowest priced carrier at the particular times I prefer to fly. In the last year I recall only one incidence of the flight being delayed for reasons that were unexplained (a thunderstorm in Sydney grounding all flights not included). I've experienced one cancelled flight but had more than a day's notice. I've completely given up on Jetstar due to their being more often 30mins delayed than actually on time and two cancellations in a three month window. I now simply won't fly any other carrier if Rex also offers a direct route at a time approximating when I want to fly.

### "Highly recommend Rex"
Highly recommend Rex. You no longer treated like “cattle class”. All round service, efficiency and food was great. Biggest plus was the amount of leg room. If Rex maintain this standard they will shake up our domestic flight industry where the current 3 major players have let their standards fall to below an acceptable level. I’m actually looking forward to my return flight.

### "What a sensational service"
Not Verified |  What a sensational service which allowed my daughter / niece to board the plane with me to ensure I was settled and knew where I was going. I am 90, a little frail and forgetful. Its a service that isn't well known, even the ground crew where not aware initially. A few calls to customer service had that fixed and we were good to go. My daughter came with me in Melbourne, we were taken out to the plane in a car, up in the hydraulic lift and she came on board. Got me settled and left. Same at the other end when flying back. Upon landing I waited patiently and my daughter was there to fetch me. Outstanding service, which I would use again providing my health holds up. If not they have a carers facility which would allow my daughter to fly with me at little or no cost. Rex allowed me to spend 2 weeks with my family in the city I was born, whilst my loving daughter went on an over due holiday to QLD with her hubby.

### “Joke of an airline”
Flight to Sydney from Melbourne cancelled after multiple delays. They don't even provide accomodation for cancelling a flight overnight, the next they arranged is 7:30am. I have to wait for my checked bag to come out for few more hours yet. Joke of an airline, avoid if flying late. At least Jetstar provides accomodation

### "staff extremely helpful and friendly"
Not Verified |  First time on Rex and definitely not the last. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly throughout the trip and even the baggage handling team where very careful when loading the plane. I have no doubts that we will be using Rex again as our domestic carrier from now on. Great job.

### "Nice crew, comfortable seats"
First time flying with Rex and wouldn’t hesitate to fly again with them. Nice crew, comfortable seats and on time. I’ve flown with Jetstar many times but so over their flight delays.

### "4 times rescheduled on the day"
Worst customer service. Cancelled flight, after 4 times rescheduled on the day, merging 3 separate flights together, still on ground 5 hours after. Offered a full refund. Accepted. 35 days, airline now claims only 2 staff process refunds, and haven’t been able to process mine for 35 days. We spent $1824 extra on this trip to make alternative, on the day arrangements, plus cancellation fees , etc etc, as it was a business trip. We have contacted them 25 times. No complaints department communication with 2 active complaints, no contact and no contact number. Hire a donkey and ride anywhere but don’t book with this airline. As bad as the big red kangaroo.

### "experience was far from satisfactory"
I recently had the opportunity to travel with Rex Airlines on a trip from Wagga Wagga to Adelaide. Unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. Upon checking in at Wagga Wagga Airport, I encountered an unexpected hurdle when I was informed that my fragile item could not be carried on board as I had hoped. Despite the item being meticulously packed with layers of bubble wrap and cardboard corners, I had to check it in as luggage. The journey began with a delay of 1 ½ hours before our flight to Sydney finally took off. After a layover in Sydney, we faced another hour-long delay before continuing to our final destination, Adelaide. Upon arrival in Adelaide, the challenges persisted. No baggage claim carousels were labelled with flight information, leaving passengers, including myself, unsure of where to collect our belongings. Other passengers generously helped each other navigate the situation. Upon retrieving my other bags, I discovered that my fragile item was missing. This led to a frantic search and conversations with representatives from three other airlines present at the airport. Although these staff members tried to assist us, we still hadn't received any customer service from Rex at this point. Eventually, after considerable effort, we located our fragile item  only to find that the glass had been shattered and the item damaged. Seeking assistance, we were directed upstairs since there were no Rex staff in the baggage service area. However, the process of finding customer service became a bit confusing and disorganized, resulting in us being redirected back downstairs to wait for a staff member. Feeling frustrated, we decided to call for assistance using a courtesy phone. A Jetstar representative promptly arrived and collected a form to begin proceedings for the damaged item, however it was not their responsibility. Nevertheless, they contacted Rex staff on our behalf. Despite these efforts, the waiting continued, and we again attempted to seek help from check-in customer service, only to be directed back downstairs to the baggage claim area. Finally, after waiting for what felt like an eternity during our ten-hour transit, a Rex representative appeared and performed a cursory examination of the damaged item. We were informed that the item's fragility meant they held no liability for the damage. During this encounter, the Rex customer service officer made a passing remark about checking or inquiring about the incident before speaking to us, which led us to believe crucial information may have been withheld to avoid liability. In conclusion, the customer service provided by Rex Airlines during this journey was deplorable. The lack of clear communication, consistent redirection, and apparent indifference to our concerns left a lasting negative impression. Due to this unfortunate experience, I will not be traveling with Rex Airlines again. If Rex Airlines aims to retain loyal customers and improve their reputation, I strongly advise reevaluating their customer service model. Redirecting customers without providing adequate assistance will undoubtedly lead to more dissatisfied passengers and tarnish the airline's image.

### "a very enjoyable flight"
Better than Qantas, Virgin or Jetstar For the first time, I booked Rex to fly from Canberra to Melbourne. It was a good deal with luggage and I took it. When checking in, it was lovely Mandy, who greeted me with a big smile. She checked me in and I was on my way to go to my gate. Later, while I was waiting for the call, Mandy came and gave me an upgrade to their business class. She knew that I was going to Pilgrimage to Mecca and she wanted me to have a good trip! I was very grateful. Upon boarding, I was presented with this clean aircraft with friendly crew. I was surprised to see how professional and courteous they were. Overall, that was a very enjoyable flight. All flights should be like this. I will definitely fly again with Rex.

### "badly mismanage flights"
Seat size ok. Service abominable. 1hr delay and lost connection fare Plus additional bus and train fees. Subsequent 2hr delay meant missing last train out of Melbourne as well, getting stuck on a 3hr coach run to arrive at 4.15am (I was due in 10.30pm). How can they so badly mismanage flights? And so late for updates? They must have known earlier than notification that they'd not make it, they should have been offering refunds early to allow passengers to try their luck with the other, earlier, on time departing airlines. I'll never fly again, and most certainly not with Rex.

### "definitely fly with them again"
On time flight with good style of seat and positive vibe on the ground and in the air. Cabin crew showed a real down to earth care for 'their' airline, reflecting the refreshing realism of Rex's rustic character. Paid a few extra dollars for some leg room which, when taken in context of an already affordable price point, presented great value for money. Flown Rex regionally before but this was my first time on a domestic route and will definitely fly with them again.

### "outstanding service"
Absolutely outstanding service from flight crew and cabin crew Laura and team. Laura is an amazing positive, caring, knowledgeable team member. Well done Rex on training, support. Great airline and will travel again.

### "old fashioned customer service"
Upon checking in at the Rex Airlines counter at Sydney airport I received exceptional and thoughtful service from Jorja. I have a pacemaker and Jorja took the time to assist me by walking me to the appropriate security section and making sure I was taken care of by security staff. I found Jorja’s assistance invaluable and nothing was a problem for her. Jorja showed not only professionalism but also a kind caring approach to my needs. I will not forget her kindness. What a wonderful approach to old fashioned customer service.

### "all very happy and helpful"
I wish to thank all the staff they were all very happy and helpful, I have flown with all of the Aussie airlines and Rex you top the cake for me.

### "good old fashioned service"
This is the best regional airline I have flown. Pricing and sector times are almost identical to the big Q, but the staff are so friendly, providing superbly efficient service. Not only that, the seats were really comfortable. For good old fashioned service, fly REX, you wont be sorry.

### "Horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Horrible experience with REX Airlines. Tried them for the first time to fly to Brisbane return from Sydney. The experience has been extremely frustrating leading us to never wanting to try REX again. We booked our flights, someone then couldn't make it so we replaced them. They refused to do a name change, not even if we tried to pay for it which is bizarre and frustrating. When booking our seats, it caused another fee. They made bold statements saying they want to be competitive to major airlines but they simply are not competitive at all. Their service sucks, their brand sucks. Do yourself a favour and spend just a little bit more to fly with QANTAS or Virgin. They were dreadful.

### "very pleasant and friendly"
Not Verified |  We flew Rex from Sydney to Melbourne. The check in staff were very pleasant and friendly. My wife has mobility problems and the check in staff gave my wife a wheel chair. The customer service staff member, moved our booked seat to one nearer the front of the aircraft. Boarded as priority, and received a warm welcome from cabin crew. The interaction by the cabin crew was absolutely fabulous. For a budget airline REX could teach a thing or two too other airlines especially customer service.

### "in Melbourne was utterly unhelpful"
Rex staff at Melbourne Airport were appalling when i visited them to check in the day before my flight. The lady who attended to me first in Melbourne was utterly unhelpful. Her colleague seemed to realise that I was being mis-advised and so the other Rex person stepped in and completed what was required to be done. On the day of my flight I needed help re carrying my bigger bag - next time I will make sure I have a bag with wheels. But the Rex personnel said that they could not help me with that until I had been through the check in area (yet Adelaide staff in Rex did help when I was in Adelaide earlier) I use an aid to walk and I am elderly and I was flying solo. Rex staff at airport were negative when I asked if a trolley or something after I had gone through checkin to help me to carry the bag. I asked if that was possible and I got no where. I did not know where to go to wait for the plane and was told I should go back where i came from to the Rex staff. So different to the Rex staff in Adelaide. After letting a man in the area where one goes through the xray that I did not know how far the walk was nor where to go he was completely disinterested. If I started walking and chose the wrong way I was worried I might miss the plane. He, utterly disinterested, told me "if you miss your plane you can try to get a refund" i felt worried and distressed, Eventually another person did help me and it was a long walk - much longer than I anticipated , to the correct area. I thanked that person who was not a Rex employee. I had told the Rex staff the day before that I thought I would need some assistance re getting to the plane. Yet was that request not documented? Because on the flight day they blamed me for not having asked earlier for assistance. I clearly did say the day before that I would require assistance. The Rex staff at Melbourne were not kind, not interested, not understanding and not reassuring. Only at the final moment just before boarding and just before she finished her shift for the day did a very nice Rex lady come over to me and she advised that she had arranged some help for me. that was good. BUut when I arrived in Adelaide no one on the plane had arranged for me to get help with getting my heavier bag out to the taxi as no one had been asked to arrange that. Fortunately another person - one of the air hostesses on the plane stepped in and suggested I wait until the other passengers had left the plane and then she would get me a person to help. I appreciated her understanding. I cannot understand why, for the same airline, that staff in one city can be pleasant and helpful while their colleagues in another city could not care less

### "The meal was wonderful"
Not Verified |  The best Australian business class flight I have taken. A friendly welcome by Liam and superb service from Lucinda in business class. The welcome to business class when asking what pre-flight drink we wanted to the lunch service - all done on one tray delivered to your seat and the service of the wine or soft drinks to each passenger was amazing. The meal was wonderful and high quality - even a warm bread roll, cake & chocolate as well as a bottle of water.

### "Awful experience"
Awful experience. Outbound flight was cancelled 10 hours before departure, had to call (40 mins) to reschedule and told no flights until following day despite still selling seats online. Departed 22 hours later than planned. Arrived in Sydney and shortly after received another text to say my return flight was cancelled, and again after a 70 min call, could only put me on a flight the following day despite seats being available, but not allowed to put me in business class seat. Had to cancel flight and pay $500 for a last min seat with Virgin so could get home. Abysmal service. Would not use (or try to use) again.

### "Sky rocketing fares"
Not Verified | Very unreliable aircraft. Sky rocketing fares expect to pay $500-600 for one way fare. No consideration for the people in small communities

### "I will book with another airline"
Poor booking conditions and customer service. I purchased a flexible ticket (so I thought) that allowed flight changes (for a small additional fee). However, despite the fare rules clearly permitting flight changes (and not stipulating that additional T&Cs apply), there is a separate table of additional fare rules with additional rules. These include more rules, such as that fares flight changes do not include a change of origin/destination. After spending >45 minutes on hold to speak to a CSR, Rex's website crashed in the middle of the call. Sorry, Rex. If you're going to offer flexible fares, make them flexible. Next time I will book with another airline that's clear about its T&Cs.

### "service was excellent"
Not Verified | The flight was amazing. It was on time and we arrived home 10 minutes earlier. The service was excellent. Will definitely fly Rex again!

### "had the most amazing flight"
My partner and I flew with Rex on the 29th of December on flight ZL 665 GC - Melbourne. We had the most amazing flight. The staff were so incredibly nice, The flight was on time, The flight was comfortable and everything about our journey was great. I usually fly with other airlines but since this great experience I will always try to fly Rex instead. Thank you for such an enjoyable trip.

### "meal was fine for a short flight"
I enjoyed the flight. Check in was very easy. The service on the plane was very friendly and helpful. The meal was fine for a short flight. The wine served was excellent. I hope REX is here to stay !

### "staff are helpful and courteous"
Not Verified |  I was supposed to be on a flight at 8.30am on 6th December but my daughter mixed up the times and I arrived too late. Joe at the check-in was so helpful and made a phone call and was able to get me on the next flight at no expense. I travel frequently between Coffs and Sydney and the staff are helpful and courteous.

### "told that it cannot be refunded"
I called Rex Airlines to get a refund for a booking that was made within 10 minutes and was told that it cannot be refunded and they can only offer in credit. Was unable to speak to any higher ups on the phone and as a someone who don't fly domestic flights often, I feel I got 130 dollars scammed and I will never use Rex in future. Even Jetstar is much better than this and I cannot believe that this does not breach the Australian consumer laws. Just pay a little bit more and go with a proper airlines and don't end up losing 130 dollars like me.

### "First time flight with Rex and it won’t be the last"
Not Verified |  First time flight with Rex and it won’t be the last. The flight was on time, no extra charge for luggage, free refreshments and much cheaper than the opposition. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and the airplane was clean so I can’t see any reason not to return.

### "compliment the cabin crew"
I would like to compliment the cabin crew on this flight. Their attitude and attention to detail reminded me of the good old Ansett Airline days where the staff took great pride in looking after their passengers. You could see that they just enjoyed what they we doing, especially Sergio's contagious smile beaming the full length of the aircraft that topped off an overall excellent experience. I was fortunate to get the same on my return flight ZL152 on 14 Dec 2022. Please thank this team for a job well done. Rex Airlines has definitely become my number one choice when flying domestically.

### "Why would anyone not fly Rex"
Recommended by friends who are frequent flyers of Rex, we most recently booked seats to attend a family weekend with your airline, as we took their tips to 'only fly with Rex Airlines - the best!'. Immediately approached as we entered the T2 Terminal, a young lady offered her services should we require assistance, and she hit the mark, as I do have compromised legs which quite often require attention. A wheel-chair was immediately set aside for my husband or an employer to wheel me through to the check-in point and, with very little fuss. The friendly staff took me to my seat early and ensured I was comfortably placed, allowing a spare seat between my husband and myself to enable easy on/off departures. Equally, there was a wheel-chair waiting at the Melbourne terminal for our transition to the lighter flight to Burnie, Tasmania., and also at the Burnie landing. 10 out of 10! Our return flights home were similarly smooth-sailing, with the unexpected sets of two steep flights of stairs facing us as the plane landed in Sydney. Never mind - this was not a problem for the airline who Immediately called on the services of a Rex gentleman/employer who arrived with a sedan-chair which delivered my husband and I, into his car, and right into the baggage collection centre. Service with a smile! Why would anyone not fly Rex, if service on the spot appears to be their 'modus operandi'.

### "flight attendants were so professional and friendly"
Flew with Rex 3 times so far and will definitely use this airline again. On all previous occasions, all flight attendants were so professional and friendly. They really treat you with a lot of respect even with how demanding the airline industry has become. On the last occasion, I misplaced my boarding pass and the last thing I wanted to do was to go back to the kiosk only to wait another 30 minutes at the security clearance. Luckily enough, a lively, older lady was happy to reprint me another pass and throughout, she was maintaining a lovely conversation while other flight attendants, from other airlines, were sitting on their phones barely showing any interest to their own passengers. Upon entering the plane, I was met was with a flight attendant who was by far, the best flight attendant I have ever come across. He made the little extra effort of greeting you onto the plane using your title and last names. This really made the flight experience a little more personal. Having to sit at the front row, I was truly entertained by his service to passengers especially the elderly and children, he greeted the nervous children who approached the plane nervously and went to their seating giggling, laughing and excited for the flight. Offered the parents for the children to meet the pilots once all passengers have taken their seats. If you are an elderly or a parent with children, I highly recommend REX. Throughout the journey, I was addressed by name as offered refreshments and snacks. I was made to feel like a person and not a customer or passenger. Even though I was not hungry, the FA suggested some snacks that were so delicious. I truly can't see myself flying with any Airline and I wouldn't recommend any other airline but Rex. 10/10 service!

### "Before I even got on the plane its a disaster"
Before I even got on the plane its a disaster. Original flight cancelled and moved to a flight two hours later. This was not suitable so had to call to get an earlier flight. Managed to get one an hour earlier. They didn't transfer my seats across so now I'm going to have to separate my two small children so good luck other passengers. Waited on hold for 25 mins to speak to someone because couldn't check in online. I started speaking and they put me on hold then came back pretending they couldn't hear my and just cut me off. Told me to wait 15 mins and the online check in would work. it didn't. I don't mind waiting because of lack of staff but to be ignored and cut off is something else entirely.

### "What a dream experience"
Not Verified |  I am a regular flying customer and have been disappointed with this post Covid craziness and cancellations of Jetstar and Virgin. Airport long lines and waiting waiting. None of that with Rex. What a dream experience. Can't say enough of great service and organised on time flights. Will definitely be flying Rex again.

### "Nice and friendly welcome from crew"
Plane B737-800 in a very good condition and clean. Nice and friendly welcome from crew. Flight was on time and safety procedures were done physically. After take-off, inflight service started after 45 minutes. Crew was offering coffee with pretzel or juice with cookies. There was no IFE but who need it on a such a short flight.

### "The worst experience ever"
The worst experience ever. My carry-on bag was a fraction of an inch too big so it was confiscated and placed in checked in baggage. This caused me great inconvenience, as I was held to ransom to pay $55 extra for the bag to go in the luggage area. After 55 years of flying the worst experience with the worst airline. Never again. Their 737 has the smallest legroom ever.

### "By and large a good flight"
I had to purchase this flight at the very last minute when Jetstar cancelled my flight. I enjoyed the flight. Service was friendly and efficient and the flight left on time. The meal was ok, although the taste was a bit dry. The wine served was both delicious. and generous. By and large a good flight.

### "Cabin crew were sub-standard"
Sydney to Gold Coast. Cabin crew were sub-standard and barely coping. The loads were full but sitting in a window seat I was ignored and disregarded for service and had to try and get the attention of the attendant for water because she was so pre occupied with the couple beside me. When she reached me she hurriedly threw a glass of water at me without an apology. Also over a lunch break surely we could have a savoury refreshment instead of a chocolate brownie thrown at you. I will probably avoid Rex to travel on again

### "couldn't have been more helpful"
I'd never flown Rex before, however, I'd heard good things. From booking to disembarking the whole process was easy. The reminder emails and texts were easy to understand and follow, the check-in process was easy. I am a single dad and was travelling with my three daughters eldest being 10 and Rex allowed me to board first with them to get them settled which removed some of the stress from me. The staff onboard couldn't have been more helpful ensuring I knew that if there was anything I needed they'd assist. They provided my girls with some snacks & water before the rest of the flight as we were seated at the back. They assisted in watching the girls as I used the facilities. They even gave them a few extra snacks on the way down.

### "a wonderful flight experience"
I didn't know of Rex Airlines before I booked. I needed to visit family & Jetstar & Virgin prices were over my budget, especially for such a short trip. My sister suggested I check out REX prices. They were half the cost of the 2 major airlines and with no added cost surprises like luggage & seating. My expectations weren't high, but I was pleasantly surprised. The on board staff were exceptionally pleasant, helpful and obliging. The space when seated was larger than Jetstar offers, and the leg room accordingly. And what a surprise to be offered a snack with Tea or Coffee, AND at no extra cost. My only disappointment is, that they don't fly to Darwin. I hope that happens in the near future because if they do, they will have a new permanently loyal customer. Thankyou REX for a wonderful flight experience.

### "impressed with the service"
First time flying with Rex and I was impressed with the service. The planes are former Virgin aircraft and comfortable. The food was very good and couldn’t fault the service. Much better than the other business offerings I’ve had recently.

### "definitely fly with Rex again"
Aircraft pretty old but its well maintained and the service is really good. First time flying with rex and got wonderful crew that took care of me and my buddy on business class. Alex the crew manager was very attentive, friendly and ensure we have the wonderful experience on Rex. What i like about rex is they are unique and the beef pie was really good. Highly recommend for flyers to have an option to fly domestically. Price is a reasonable one as well. Will definitely fly with Rex again in the future.

### Rex Airlines customer review
Not Verified |  My flight was cancelled on jetstar and they couldn't get me home for 4 days. Rex got me on a flight the next day for 1/3 price of jetstar. I am forever grateful. Free drink and snack and less hassle / more friendly than other companies. The staff are friendly and the service is excellent. I have not had any issues with this airline.

### "true blue hospitality on board"
REX does bring its heart back into the country. I have completed 7 flights with REX all on board the 737, and I their level of service leaves the other two major airlines for dead. The staff are genuine, engaging, and take the time to talk to you, regardless of class. I have flown majority in Economy. The great true blue hospitality on board, great fares, included bags is why I keep going back. I have only flown them between Melbourne to Sydney or Sydney to Brisbane (or reverse). I just wish they connected Sydney to Adelaide.

### "Best ground and cabin service"
Best ground and cabin service I have experienced in many years of flying. Staff are friendly and great communicators. I flew in difficult conditions from Sydney to Brisbane - pouring rain and Sydney flooding and returned in high winds and the closure of all but one runway. The staff can’t control the weather but they are efficient and effective. They are very well trained and behaved like real people and not automatons! I will choose REX over the others now. I wonder if the others are just too big to be good at what they do? Well done to all REX staff

### "extremely impressed"
Sydney to Melbourne. This was the first time my family have flown Rex and we are extremely impressed. Booking online was easy and bag check in was a breeze so quick and easy. The flight on time and smooth flight, the plane was clean and comfortable but the stand out was the team obviously Rex has a great culture of customer service “Good old customer service” so refreshing, they really care. We will definitely be flying Rex in the future. Some price as the discount airlines but real customer service

### "Great service all round"
My return trip to Melbourne was excellent, both ways. The staff are genuinely friendly and helpful. No delays on the trip to Melbourne but there was on the trip to Brisbane. There was a technical malfunction with getting food onto the plane. Passengers were kept informed. It was great to see all staff hands on deck doing their best to get the trolleys loaded. One woman had three kids who were clearly becoming rowdy and impatient. Staff got her to the front of the queue and boarded after those needing assistance. Great service all round.

### "staff were happy, obliging and friendly"
Rex Airlines were excellent to deal with the whole way through. From the first booking, cancelled due to covid, then using the credit to rebook this time. There were no flight time changes or flight cancellations from them. The staff at the counter showed us how to process the check in- our first time with Rex. All the staff were happy, obliging and friendly from check in, to in flight. We will definitely use them again tripping between Melbourne and the GC. It was a pleasant surprise. Thanks Rex.

### "it just keeps getting better and better"
Not Verified |  Just want to congratulate all of the staff from the gate to the crew on ZL309, Brisbane-Sydney, 9th June. You made a very stressful morning at Brisbane Domestic so much better. Each time I fly with you it just keeps getting better and better! You are showing the others how flying should be done.

### "I’ll never fly with them again"
I boarded my flight in the morning 9.30 am for Regional Express heading to Melbourne. Plane was full we were on the runaway and the Pilot announced an issue with the engine. We had to wait on board for half n hour and then they announced we all had to get off the aircraft. We were waiting 2hrs and then told we have to keep waiting and then we had to get another flight with another airline (at our own cost) or wait till 8.30 at night for the next flight. Im still waiting for my refund 7 weeks later. They were rude and unhelpful and I’ll never fly with them again!

### "an amazing first experience"
Not Verified |  I just wanted to give REX the biggest of compliments. Not only was it easy to book a last minute flight (no fault to my own. Virgin cancelled my flight and would only put me on a flight tomorrow morning) but your customer service and being upgraded because of my terrible experience with flying recently was greatly and amazingly appreciated! Your check in staff started this with moving my seat to front on economy while your staff at the gate upgraded to me to business class. I can only say thank you from the bottom of my heart for an amazing first experience with Rex. You will now always be a choice in my flights moving forward! Thank you to Justin (I believe was the cabin staff lead) not only did he provide an amazing experience but all your cabin staff were friendly and amazing!

### "friendly service of staff"
We have recently started flying with Rex Airlines. We have been pleasantly surprised by the friendly service of staff, on time departures and our luggage was waiting on the carousel when we arrived to collect it.

### "Would not recommend!"
Sydney to Melbourne. 5 hour delays for flight. Missed out on a lot activities planned for my birthday trip. Was offered vouchers for refreshments that were worthless. Would not recommend!

### "the best customer service"
Rex Airlines is super warm and friendly. Felt treated like a VIP, staff helping you when you arrive at the airport, you will be approached by a real human rather than a cold machine. In Melbourne on the 29 March, the staff member was ready to help - the best customer service, checked my suitcase in for me and told me where to go every step of the way, great for a first time traveller with Rex. Very impressed, cabin clean, tidy and covid safe, Great experience with Rex. Will travel with them again.

### "recommend to fly with this airline"
Not Verified |  I had such a great service that I had to write a few words. What a pleasure to fly with REX, the service was great. The service I received on this flight and the care from the crew was more than special, not had such fantastic service like REX provided on this flight. I recommend to fly with this airline, you will not be disappointed.

### "made the entire process so much simpler"
I found them to be extremely helpful and professional. When I first arrived at Melbourne airport to check-in I was looking for my booking reference to find my flight and check in and a lovely staff member helped me check-in via my name instead. She made the entire process so much simpler. All the staff have been so helpful and helped make my trip a much easier, less-stressful experience. The flight attendants and pilots on both flights were also great.

### "recommend using this airline"
We were upgraded to Business Class which was a lovely surprise. The staff were exceptional, food and drinks were top class and served with smiles and lots of laughter. As my sister and I needed wheelchairs the staff made sure we were treated like royalty. We will never forget the kindness that was shown to us. I highly recommend using this airline for your next flight and discover service beyond anything you have experienced before.

### "delighted with my first flight"
My first time flying with Rex I was absolutely delighted with my first flight on Rex Airlines! It sure won’t be the last. The efficient and courteous customer service was greatly appreciated. Also being given a complimentary upgrade to business class on the Melbourne to Sydney leg was a treat.

### "genuine interest in their passengers"
As we fly interstate on a regular basis and have only recently encountered Rex Airlines, this service has taken a means of getting from one destination to another level. We have had the pleasure of flying both Business and Economy so can give feed back on the fabulous and unique service across the aircraft. The Cabin Crew are attentive, enthusiastic, warm and friendly and display a genuine interest in their passengers. Business Class was above and beyond. The service was exceptional, all beverages were generously replenished. The food was delicious and might I say the best we have consumed on any airline. . Economy Class we felt very welcomed. The complimentary drinks and snacks consisted of quality produce. We are extremely pleased that Rex has extended their routes allowing us the pleasure of supporting them. Rex has definitely set the bar high here in Australia and we look forward to seeing the smiling friendly faces of crew and ground staff on our frequent trips. Offering a fare price point for domestic travel may enable us to enjoy a luxury upgrade on a more regular basis.

### "Fantastic experience - very refreshing and smooth"
Fantastic experience - very refreshing and smooth, website was easy to use, check-in at Sydney was a delight (kiosk worked perfectly) ground staff were relaxed and friendly. Business class seats were comfy with nice Meze plate for a snack - and delicious caramel for desert. Boutique style, crew were again relaxed and having fun with passengers, inexperience but soo friendly - lots of offers for wine refill had to decline in the end! Very well meaning. Free wifi and streaming. Only critique was Meal was presented okay, but would fly Rex over Qantas or Virgin any day simply due to friendly and relaxed atmosphere and staff. Great value for money and a joy to fly!

### "What a fabulous airline"
What a fabulous airline, the plane was spotless and fresh and the crew were amazing! The service was second to none. Will definitely make them my first choice next time we fly.

### "a nice touch to be upgraded"
I recently flew from Melbourne to Sydney and was impressed by the overall quality of Rex airlines. In particular, the cabin staff were extremely solicitous of our comfort and the food was delicious. I value good old-fashioned traditional service and Rex airlines appear to do so as well! It was also a nice touch to be upgraded to business class. Keep up the good work.

### "how impressed I was with Rex"
Just a quick message to say how impressed I was with Rex for my return flight from Brisbane to Melbourne recently. The staff were extremely professional and courteous. Bag drop off was seamless, flights on time and generous leg room. On my return flight I was upgraded which only added to the good experience had. Phillomena and her staff were welcoming and attentive, we couldn’t have asked for more. We have definitely recommended Rex to friends and family and will be using again next time we fly. Thank your staff for making what could be a stressful situation to a pleasure!

### "thought they were fantastic"
I flew with them in April 2021 and thought they were fantastic. They were very helpful when checking in, on the plane they were extremely kind. The plane was clean and the service was incredibly generous. We were given a cup of water and what they called a “sweet snack” which my girlfriend and I just thought was so adorable. We flew back on Jetstar, and were disgusted by the service.

### "The staff are exceptional"
have used Regional Express since the borders opened for domestic travel and I have to say the best domestic airline in Australia. The staff are exceptional from the moment you start the check in process and the flight crew go above and beyond to help out. Being a 6 foot person I have long legs but on the Rex flights I am not in a cramped position. Great leg room and in flight food/drinks is exceptional. The crew are very customer obsessed in a good way and always making sure you are comfortable.

### "provided me with every assistance"
My Wife and I accompanied by members of our family travelled to Merimbula on Friday morning the 3rd of December 2021 and returned to Sydney on Monday the 6th of December 2021. Every one of the employees with whom I came in contact provided me with every assistance which I needed, I can't thank your employees enough for what they did for me to make my Flights so enjoyable. My return flight was ZL6134, unfortunately I cannot find my forward boarding pass. I am forever grateful to the members of your staff!

### "a great overall experience"
Melbourne to Mildura return was my first experience flying Rex, and it was a great overall experience. Check-in at Melbourne was quick and easy (had already checked in online, but wanted to check a bag in as not sure how much storage there was on the Saab). The flight was quick and easy and the cabin crew member each way were friendly and professional. Snack and beverage served each way (coffee, tea, water, Byron Bay Cookie). Looking forward to flying on their 737 service later this month.

### "Value for money this airline is terrific"
My return trip from Melbourne to Sydney was outstanding. Rex ground and flight crew were efficient, helpful and friendly. Value for money this airline is terrific. There are no hidden extras when you book and you actually pay the price that was advertised. Rex have a full COVID 19 Refund Policy which is easy to access. Within days of requesting a refund after Melbourne's last lockdown the money was back in my account. I can't rate Rex highly enough, this airline is the real deal.

### "refund was processed immediately"
We had booked a REX flight from Sydney to Melbourne and return for a business trip in July/August 2021. We had to cancel the flights due to a Covid-19 outbreak and travel restrictions. The process of cancelling your flight with REX is so easy, simple and quick. The cancellation and refund was processed immediately with no questions asked.

### "excellent customer service"
I am flying to Adelaide today for my dads 91st birthday. Last week I tripped over and broke my left wrist in 2 places. So it was with some trepidation that i took this flight…but it has been the most fantastic experience. Darren assisted me right away to book in, helped me with my case and upgraded me to business class due to my injuries. Darren was so kind and caring! Amazing value and excellent customer service.

### "very family friendly"
Excellent airline to fly, very family friendly, great in-flight complimentary service and staff are very friendly and willing to help. On par with Qantas and very well priced. Will always fly Rex.

### "Fabulous service"
Julie from the customer service team was excellent in assisting us to change a flight at pretty short notice. I can't imagine how hammered airlines must be at the moment, and she was calm, helpful, and even called back when the call dropped out! Fabulous service.

### "never recommend this mob to anyone"
I booked a flight online through an agency for a return flight to Adelaide from Melbourne. The conference I was in ran late and I missed my return flight. I rang the support help line and the rude supervisor informed me the ticket had been cancelled with no chance of getting me on another flight, or a refund. She was totally rude and unwilling to help me. I had to book on another airline at my expense to get home. Will never recommend this mob to anyone, they should stick to regional flights and not try to mix it with the professional carriers in domestic flights. They should also try employing polite reasonable supervisors with customer service in mind. I rang them and spoke to a service person, who went and asked her supervisor who refused to transfer me onto another flight, but just cancelled my ticket with no refund. Disgraceful

### "very pleasant and enjoyable flight"
Overall very pleasant and enjoyable flight, especially for the price point. (That basically places it directly against budget carriers like Jetstar and they are just in completely different leagues). The Rex domestic 737 fleets, as you may know already uses previous Virgin Australia planes, and the interior is essentially Virgin themed (Virgin colored head rests, bulkhead covers). Which don't get me wrong, it isn't a bag thing at all. This means at a budget rex price you get to enjoy full service carrier class legroom (same legroom ad Virgin Australia) and everything. There are also snacks provided during the flight (again, something you don't see often at this price point) along with a complimentary drink. Boarding is done via jetbridges for the front section of the airplane and stairs for the back section, to speed up turnover times. Overall, an excellent option that definitely introduces fresh competition to the other carriers serving this short Melbourne-Sydney route!

### "will not travel again with Rex"
I booked the wrong way instead of MEL-SYD-MEL booked SYD-MEL-SYD same dates. Once I found the error, called 131713 and informed the same within 48 hours of purchasing the 6 tickets under single booking. This is 3 weeks before the flight. This girl charged $66 for each passenger although all six under single booking. Return flight cost $77 but 2 minutes route change cost additional $66 per passenger. Very unhappy and will not travel again with Rex.

### "Friendly customer service"
Friendly customer service. Complementary snack and hot drinks were offered on board. Very reasonably priced - my fare included checked in luggage up to 23kg. Plane was on time Highly recommend this company.

### "friendly and service oriented airline"
I took advantage of incredible airfares for a short trip to Sydney and can't fault my flights. From check-in to the Cabin crew especially Andy and all ground crew I interacted with everything was spot on. For a short flight they certainly delivered and I experienced the same on my return flight to Melbourne. It's about time Australia had such a friendly and service oriented airline.
