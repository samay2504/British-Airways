### "Avoid this airline at all costs"
Not Verified |  Avoid, even when they switch to charters. They cancelled the flight without notifying their customers. We showed up to the flight about two hours before flight time, and noticed the electronic kiosk showed our flight had been cancelled. We had not been notified in any way. Speaking with the customer service vice agent at the airport, they told us to call a number and they couldn't help is bring that. When I asked about how to get a refund, they just laughed at me. Avoid this airline at all costs.
