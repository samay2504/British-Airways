### “price was pretty outrageous”
It has been a while since I had flown this company but unfortunately their offering is poor and service appears to have deteriorated, in spite of them being considered the more 'reputable' airlines in Nepal, with a general lack of professionalism in all areas. I was at the airport 1.5 hours ahead of departure, as instructed on the ticket - but it was total chaos. Everyone was standing around with no place to sit and I was told the desk (just a kiosk in a large crowded hall) wasn't open yet. I had to stand amongst the crowd for almost 40 mins before it finally opened - why couldn't they have just checked us in and let us rest in the waiting lounge? The flight was about an hour late, which is actually not bad considering the frequent disruption in Nepal's airspace. On board, the plane interiors looked tired and rundown and clearly were in need of refurbishment. The cabin crew were polite, but there was absolutely no in flight service, not even a glass of water - a few years ago I remember being offered a snack and drink. The return was a drama. My flight was cancelled the day before, and the new flight was delayed by 2 hours, but when I arrived at the airport, I was on put on a different earlier flight which was also delayed - very confusing. Fortunately there is a proper luggage reclaim system in operation now, unlike in the past when it was all manual. For this generally poor service, the price was pretty outrageous - $204 return for a half an hour flight and this was apparently the lowest fare available, when you can get tickets on a similar flight in India or Europe for $70-80. Note that this is a monopoly fare just for 'foreigners' - prices for Nepali and Indian citizens are less than half. It is actually very sad, as these companies should be trying to support tourism and contributing to national development - yet instead they see guests to Nepal as an opportunity to make a quick buck, and think that foreigners will put up with this sub-standard service and will be happy to pay a premium for it. Very bad for Nepal's international reputation and serious government regulation needed to reign these companies in.

### “arrogant behaviour”
We had a flight from Pokhara to Kathmandu as per the image attached, it got delayed by 2 hours, we missed our international flight from Kathmandu and lost 50000INR. It's not unforgivable as weather conditions are out of anybody's control. But what made us feel bad was the arrogant behaviour from the man in charge of the boarding gate. He was so rude on my enquiry about the delay that we felt as if we were beggars travelling free of cost in your flight. So, I would like to remind you people that you should refrain from appointing such merciless ones on your counters. Afterall, we spent our hard earned money for your flight! So at least ask them to be sympathetic on the flight delays that are going to happen in the future.

### "The worse experience"
Not Verified |  Counter attendant in Kathmandu have no manners while dealing with passenger. The worse experience while traveling with Budhha Air.

### "Worst service and worst passenger handling"
Such a shameless worst service I have ever taken. I have chosen Buddha Air 3 times up to now and Buddha Air is always delayed. 1.5 hrs delayed and they kept us inside the bus for the whole 1.5 hrs in this heat. They said they were maintaining the tire first and they said their airplane’s door needed maintenance again. February 2, 2023 is going to be my last flight with Buddha Air. Worst service and worst passenger handling. The crew members don’t even know how to handle the crowd. Buddha Air - never again.

### "flights has been delayed"
Each and every time this airlines flights has been delayed by minimum of 30 minutes. If thats the case then they must early inform all the passenger either by email or by a text to their respective mobile so that we dont have to wait inside an airport for over more than 2 hours. I had a flight in 01 feb 2023 at 1045 and now the flight has been merged with 1145. At least they could early inform. What a shame to Buddha Air. Customer satisfaction is in negative level.

### "Unprofessional customer service"
Worst airline. I will not fly any more with this airline. Unprofessional customer service. Feel ashamed to say it’s my country airlines

### "lack of efficient communication"
Very inconvenient, lack of efficient communication. Buddha air should value their customers and theirs time. I had multiple travels last month all of those flights were 1-2 hours late. It would be helpful if they can announce incase of those scenarios for elderly customers.

### "unprofessional and unorganised"
Not Verified |  Bad experience: we had other flights too and were always late: unprofessional and unorganised at the airport counter: will never fly again with this airline.

### "Disgusting and unprofessional"
Not Verified |  Biratnagar to Kathmandu. I waited for 5 hours just to be notified that my flight was cancelled. I arrived airport at 1600 to catch my 17:25 hrs flight, we kept on asking if our flight was ready they told us our flight was being held but surely we would fly at 1800 hrs. But it was around 2100 hrs after boarding they told us our flight was cancelled as the pilot told his time was up! Disgusting and unprofessional.

### "Flights are always delayed"
Bharatpur to Kathmandu. Flights are always delayed and you often can't even find online updates. Basically, you arrive to the airport in the morning and the delay can be anything from 2 hours to 5.

### "No updates on board"
Pokhara to Kathmandu. 12h35 pm take off time. Now nearly 4 pm. No updates on board. Simply states delayed. Total BS. Nobody can provide us info. Meanwhile Yeti airlines has been flying to KTM since we have SAT here.

### "Buddha Air did a good job"
The airport in Kathmandu is chaotic but Buddha Air did a good job. If you don’t want to do hiking in the Himalayas you should definitely take the flight. Our flight was delayed due to weather reasons but once we took off the flight crew did an amazing job! The only two concerns with the airline I have are the safety and the reliability as I am not certain if the international standards apply here.

### "best value for money"
Flew Pokhara to Kathmandu. Buddha Air service in Nepal is excellent. Good customer care, baggage handling is good. All seats are economy class, best value for money. No entertainment system because of very short flight time i.e. 20 minute. Seat is comfortable, but windows of aircraft were not very clean. This is the best airlines on the domestic sector of Nepal.

### "outrageous foreigner fares"
Kathmandu to Biratnagar. I have travelled regularly with this company, particularly too and from Biratnagar and Nepalganj. Onboard and ground service is fine. Delays are frequent in Nepal, and this is not always the fault of the airline. Buddha uses relatively new planes, which are comfortable inside, although given the short length of most routes, this is not really an issue. Checking in and baggage collection can be chaotic sometimes, primarily due to the poor infrastructure at domestic airports. The ATR flights usually have allocated seats, so when heading west ask for a right side window for mountain views, or left side if heading east. The smaller beachcraft used to fly to some smaller towns usually have no allocated seating. If you want to be first on the plane, make sure you are last on the transfer bus. The primary problem is the outrageous fixed 'foreigner fares', which can be up to 4 times more than for local people. There are no discounts or promotional fares available, even if you book months in advance. As a result, few foreign passengers travel by air in Nepal unless they are on work related travel, although some high end tourists, usually on packages, use the route to Pokhara. You can travel to Malaysia or Dubai in economy for the same price as a return ticket to Nepalganj (35 min flight), or fly business class to India. . Sadly, all the airlines in Nepal fix these high fares, operating as a cartel - and I cant begin to imagine the damage this causes to the tourism sector, particularly in getting people to visit new parts of Nepal. This appears unlikely to change in the near future, so passengers be aware before planning your travels.

### "flight was smooth"
The Buddha Air flight I took the last was the shortest route in Nepal, an 18 minute fly from the capital Kathmandu to Simara in mid and southern Nepal. The airline check in was smooth. The staff were cooperative. They operate a frequent flyer program in the name Royal Club. As for the mileage for the Royal club, their frequent flyer program, it is offered full I'm Y, half in A, and a quarter in B. All other classes C, D and E do not add or accrue miles. The flight was on time. They used a bus to take the passenger to the boarding point. Chocolate was given on board. Seats were in 1x1 configuration. 18 people can sit on a 1900D. Flight was smooth and turbulence free. Landing and take off was good. Baggage handling at the destination the small airport of Simara is manual. The staff take the baggage out on a trolley for the passengers to claim showing there tags. Overall Buddha Air is a trusted brand in Nepal domestic sector .

### Buddha Air customer review
I have flown with them three times now and they are always late sometimes due to weather and are small planes so I understand. Meant to fly from Pokhara to Kathmandu on 18th but cancelled due to storm the staff are so disorganised you have to fight through the Nepalese to get to the desk. Chaos but flew out the next morning which was late of course. Staff are always lovely.

### Buddha Air customer review
Pokhara to Kathmandu ATR 42 aircraft. Arrived at the airport to find out my flight was over an hour late but as I was early I asked if I could be put onto the earlier flight which ended up taking off 15 minutes after the flight I had booked. The previous day I had tried to change to an earlier flight and was told that they were all full (festival time). Strangely there were at least six free seats on the plane so I don't know why they didn't rebook other passengers - clearly you have to ask. It's the same plane going back and forth so more susceptible to delays than others like Simrik that were using two Beechcraft planes that were half the size of Buddha Air's. (This also means that you can arrive at the airport see your plane but if it's an hour later you have to wait for it to go to Kathmandu and back before it's your turn.) Sweets for takeoff water in-flight which was nice - served in a 20 minute window. Most importantly it felt safe - the cabin attendants were attentive to this. It's expensive as the price is fixed for all airlines on the route but rescheduling is free of charge depending on availability (even multiple times). The Himalayas are the in-flight entertainment. Stunning.
