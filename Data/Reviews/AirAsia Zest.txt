### "happy with the service"
Manila to Kalibo. I am a frequent flier of AirAsia. I am always happy with the service that I am getting. Staff are really friendly. This is a short trip to fulfil a holiday and fantastic service. The best part is being able to sit within the exit row without paying for this.

### "passenger comfort was basic"
Now everyone can fly because of cheap fares. In a way this is a good thing. However, I don't think it brings about all good things. Low cost, on the other hand, can also mean low quality. You basically get what you pay for. My flight with Air Asia Zest to Hong Kong from Manila had more of the negatives than the positives. To begin with, our flight was delayed for over three hours at Manila Airport. The aircraft was delayed in an airport somewhere. We were asked to move gates three times that just made everyone confused. None of their ground crew came to inform and reassure passengers at least. When the aircraft finally arrived, another complication happened. The air bridge was not working, so, we had to go down the stairs to the tarmac then stairs (again) to the aircraft. Perhaps we burned some calories but all of us got wet - it was raining heavily then. Passenger comfort was basic and the food I pre-ordered was not to my liking. We arrived four hours late in Hong Kong. AirAsia will get you to destination, that's it. Customer service and passenger comfort is not a priority for this airline.

### "can have very cheap flights"
AirAsia Zest is a low-cost airline with weak ground service and delayed on my flight, with misleading information on when the flight will depart. Aircraft look nice, but there is no entertainment system. They can have very cheap flights, but costs are sometimes hidden and if the flight is canceled or seriously delayed, a cheap ticket was of no help.

### "a short but good AirAsia Zest trip"
My AirAsia Zest flight was a short flight from Manila to Cebu, but a good trip. I arrived 20 minutes earlier than scheduled, my seats were upgraded for free and my check in luggage arrived on time in the baggage claim. Everything was good but unfortunately during my flight they took off the headrest covers on the seats, and the head rest looks unclean. For money I paid for and the service I got I was satisfied.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
The ground staff in Puerto Princesa Airport and air crew of flight Z2 427 were so kind and understanding. I have traveled via AirAsia (Philippines) 4 times and I haven't encountered any problems with them. I always find their crew friendly. The online booking is easier to navigate and payment process is smooth compared to the trouble I experienced with the other local airline.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
Airline ground counter staff very unfriendly and unprofessional, unable to make any decision in favor to the customer. Though I checked in very early as sequence no. 3 the system assigned me the very uncomfortable middle seat B. The ground staff at KLIA2 fortunately helped me to find another seat since the flight was not fully booked. Cabin staff most of the time busy with themselves, took them 2 hours after departure to serve the first meals and drinks. The passengers who pre-ordered meals got served first, the rest had to wait more. Scheduling and cancellation policy worst ever. Flight scheduled for 23rd of August was confirmed by mail on 19th of July but suddenly cancelled on 29th of July. At a very short notice I had to book another flight which was of course more expensive.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
Airport used was the old Manila Domestic Airport dubbed the Terminal 4 and confuses you of a newer terminal but in fact it's an old terminal with no jetbridges and there is very poor ventilation. Zest Air is a disaster for Air Asia because it cannot be a part of the best budget airline in the world. Their airport staff in Manila are not friendly. Seat of your choice cost PhP100 even on check-in which is free-of-charge on other airlines. Their aircraft's are old and the painting is filthy (dirty) and the seat covers are torn and dirty. The cabin smells and the air conditioning is very poor. The plane I was on had several defective lights throughout the cabin making it darker. The flight attendants were friendly though but still the whole experience was a nightmare. I will never fly this airline again.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
Airport staff this time were as efficient as you can get. Check in was kind of a slow process and they do need to learn how to prioritize their lines. Not once did we get a final check in or express check in at the check in counters. By the time I got to immigration we had 20 minutes until our flight left luckily enough the immigration let us cut the line. It didn't really matter because we arrived at the gate to basically stand there for 15 mins. Our departure was at 10.50am we are boarding at 10.50am. Onboard the aircraft my seat was cracked. Staff were quite rude constantly asking us to sit down while they played who to blame for the delay. Captain didn't say anything which I found rude. It was only after 30 minutes that he informed us we missed our time slot. Cabin was quite hot. I never seen such picky flight staff in my life asking anyone who moved seats why they were moving and to proceed back to their seat. For dinner there was no stock left no meal no sandwich no coke. We finally arrived in Cebu only an hour late. You get what you paid for and I paid only $120.00 for two tickets.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
Flew TAG-MNL or at least attempted too on a low fare. After waiting 4 hours at the airport flight was canceled. Next flight with space for 8 people (my extended family) was in 3 days. We ended up taking a ferry to another city and taking another Zest flight which was itself late. No vouchers for hotel or food. Pure mayhem. Don't be fooled by the fact that Zest has a new airplanes (they do) as this missing part is how to operate them with efficiency.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
Afraid I have to join the majority here. I had booked the 21.30 flight from Kalibo to Manila on 6 July 2013 with Zest. A day in advance I got an SMS and email that this flight was cancelled and we were moved to their 23.50 flight. It is almost that time now and we were informed the flight will come in around 2 am arriving in Manila at 4am. Instead of an easy night in Manila with planned arrival 11.30 pm I now foresee a night deprived of sleep. With hindsight I should have paid 8 Euros more for Air Philippines that departed nicely on time.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
I flew several Times with Zest MNL either to TAG an CEB. My flights were never on time and very poor customer service at all stations. Comparing it to the same price level airlines which are offered with in the Philippines I would recommend not to fly with Zest Air.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
Kalibo-Manila. Flight was 2 hrs delayed on June 20 2013. Flying back to Manila-Kloilo flight Z2 330 was 2 hrs delayed. Horrible airline and poor customer service. Not recommended.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
My trip from Manila to Tagbilaran was moved by 2 hours and 50 minutes got a 3 day notice from Zest Air 3 hours of wasted time and they refused to rebook me for free. Same thing happened to my return flight Tagbilaran to Manila. This time there was no notice that the flight was delayed by 2.5 hrs.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
Had a flight December 2012 from Manila to Shanghai. Flight delayed for more than an hour. Other than that I had no complaints on that flight. Seats are spacious and comfy enough. I also booked a returned flight from Shanghai and had to cancel it due to personal matters. Calling customer service via long distance call is quite a hassle but anyway my cancellation was confirmed and they told me it'll be refunded. Well now (5 months and counting) I still do not get my refund. Can't reach customer services. Very disappointing.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
Manila-Cebu return. They changed the flight time for both my flights (1hour and 2.5hrs) but failed to inform me properly so I was first rushing to the airport because I thought I was going to miss the flight. Then had to wait in the airport for 3 and 6 hours respectively because of their wrong texts! Both flights were delayed by 1 hour. Their online booking system works only occasionally. I'm never flying with them again.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
Had a great time flying Zest Air. The staff were courteous and very accommodating! Had a 10 min delay on my outbound flight from CEB-MNL I guess that was because of the heavy rain but it didn't really matter that much. Another 30 min delay for the return flight from MNL-CEB but it was ok since I had enough time to rest at the airport terminal.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
Have flown other local carriers within the Philippines and think Zest is a step above after my recent flight from Manila to Cebu. Fares were cheap staff friendly at check-in and onboard. Domestic Terminal in Manila is basic but not the worst in the country. Plane was new and flights on time but a limited inflight food and beverage offering. Would fly again.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
MNL-BCD return. You get what you pay for. We got the early morning flight to Bacolod only to find out the flight was cancelled. Had to go back home for the afternoon flight. Same thing with our return flight to Manila - morning flight out of Bacolod cancelled. Hotel staff at Bacolod informed us it is a usual occurrence. Such a big inconvenience if your vacation time is limited or you have to catch a connecting flight. Would rather fly with Cebu Pacific or Air Philippines.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
Bacolod-Manila return. Flight times changed on both flights from early morning to late afternoon with only a few hours notice. This caused many problems. Plane from Manila delayed again. Plane itself was ok but given the delays we do not have confidence in this outfit. With three other airlines serving this route we won't be flying with Zest again.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
MNL-CEB-MNL . Excellent airline good value and on time. Friendly and helpful cabin crew. Domestic terminal is small but quick and easy to negotiate.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
Legaspi to Manila. What a refreshing airline the aircraft we used was modern and on time pleasant staff.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
Flying to Manila from Bacolod using a brand new A319. A bit of a Delay but not a problem as the staff and crew were being very professional and handled it very well. Zest air recently renewed the cabin interior of their aircraft and they truly did a good job. The crew were very friendly and very helpful the entire time so it made my day! The landing was very soft and the entire flight was very calm. Not mentioning the spacious leg room and clean cabin environment!

### AirAsia Zest customer review
As experienced by most of the travellers using Zest Airways I got my taste of it too last weekend. My flights from Manila and Busuanga were all delayed by a minimum of 2.5 hours. The lesson of flying with this airline is seared into my brain that I won't forget it. So long Zest Airways.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
MNL-PPS return in aging A319 out of old Domestic Terminal. When Cebu Pacific transferred to T3 the experience at the old domestic became a lot more pleasant. Had a slight hiccup with my youngest since she was booked as infant fare when it should have been child. Ground staff sorted it out within the hour after a few well placed phone calls. Snacks and drinks for purchase but not necessary due to the short flight. Departure and arrival both legs were on time and crew was pleasant for the short 1 hour hop.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
Manila to Legaspi. Ticket bought 1 month in advance via Internet for about 15EUR no problems paying by card. Unfortunately had the same experience as Mark - the flight was cancelled. The official reason was bad weather in the target destination but later on met people having travelled to the same destination the same day but with Airphil. A majority of passengers were rebooked for the next day (they basically merged the 2 flights – was the low number of passengers the reason for the cancellation?). The next day everything OK the flight without problems. If you don’t care about time fly with Zest – it is cheap.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
Kalibo (Boracay) to Manila flight was full. Booked 2 months in advance for roughly 1100 PHP taxes inclusive about 20 Euro. Could not complain more legroom than on Air Berlin. Flight on time and crew efficient.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
Flown Zest Air 9 times and on 8 occasions the flights have either been delayed or cancelled. The customer service staff on the ground are generally incompetent and unprofessional - listening to their ipods and eating instead of serving customers. They frequently provide inaccurate information about flight delays and the customer complaint procedure will leave you pulling your hair out. So why do I fly with them - because they are cheap and thats the only reason! Would I recommend them - No! Unless you don't mind frequent delays and a cheap price.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
MNL-CRM-MNL. Aircraft outdated but not really an issue. Flight delayed but treated well by the ground staff. Gave us lunch and refreshments which was unexpected. On way back couldn't utilize the tickets but was refunded really easily. Call center very prompt in taking calls and staff very efficient. Good value for money!

### AirAsia Zest customer review
Caticlan-Manila. Crew and ground staff very friendly. The MA-60 is far more comfortable than the De-havilland Dash8 operated by other airlines on this routes when the weather is quite rough.

### AirAsia Zest customer review
Flew with Zest air on recently launched Manila - Marinduque service got through the airport and desks with great ease. The aircraft was a new Xian MA-60 very clean. No service onboard as it was a very short flight. Reading materials great. The flight was comfortable and smooth. The crew was nice and helpful.
