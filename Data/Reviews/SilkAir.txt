### "Concerned about the COVID safety of this flight"
Concerned about the COVID safety of this flight. Passengers were requested in English, to board by seat row numbers e.g 1-4, 1-8, 1-12 etc, which is sensible. Unfortunately the majority of the passengers were young Khmer men who do not understand English. The consequence was serious overcrowding in the tunnel. I was trapped there shoulder to shoulder with other passengers for at least 10 minutes. To compound my concerns, I understand that Khmer people returning to Cambodia are not required to obtain a COVID negative test prior to flying, unlike foreigners such as myself. In addition to the poor boarding process, the plane was almost full and being a short haul flight the seats were small and close together. Despite SilkAir being owned by Singapore airlines, they gave not adopted the high standards operated by Singapore Airlines. One must also question the wisdom of serving a meal where masks are of course removed, on a flight with only a 100 minute duration.

### "it turned out okay"
I came from Japan and had a transit connection in Singapore, this was my first flight with Silk Air. As much as I looking forward to it, I have a less expectation on it, and it turned out okay. If I could choose my connecting flight, I would rather stay with SQ to Bali. The plane was rather old and dull, and the seat wasn't look inviting. There was no inflight entertainment and luckily just around 3 hours flight, they provided the newspaper and wifi connection just doesn't work. The breakfast was a delight and I wouldn't speak higher for the experience.

### "responded promptly and courteously"
Hiroshima to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. This is a review of a flight that was cancelled due to COVID-19. At first they changed the departure airport to FUK. This was unacceptable since it is a long was from HIJ. So I asked them for a full refund for all flights. Despite what must have been an incredibly busy and stressful time for them and their staff, they responded promptly and courteously to all communications, including calling me in Japan from Singapore. The refunds were duly processed with no debate as to whether the change from HIJ to FUK was reasonable or not. Well done to them for their excellent service under trying circumstances for everyone. Put the service of some other airlines to shame. And, guess what, when this is all over and we can start flying again, this is an airline I will definitely think highly of - even though I never got on their plane.

### "Comfortable, good service"
Singapore to Yangon. On-time departure from Changi terminal 2. The economy cabin felt clean and the crew were friendly. My expectation was for a basic and efficient service which was we got. This was an evening flight so we had a basic dinner which was okay, as good if not better than the Premium Economy meal from Melbourne to Singapore. Same wine Sauvignon Blanc. This time no other option so I opted for the red. Comfortable, good service, no complaints.

### "Long check-in queue"
Makassar to Singapore. Crowded flight, Long check-in queue and time. The take-off is smooth Great service, a good meal. The flight attendant is great.

### "not recommend using Silkair"
Am supposed to be on a flight on MI346 from Singapore to Penang on 28 Feb 20, 7.55am. After waiting for 30 minutes, was updated that plane is waiting for the engineering crew to check on some system fault, though it is not a risk for flight. The crew then served us some snacks to appease some of the angry customers and as I bite into the Old Chang Kee curry puff, the cover was already soggy and very nasty for consumption! At about 9.50am they told us that the system cannot be rectified and got us to another plane at gate E6 which is all the way to the other side of the airport. The flight is now delayed to depart at 10.45am. A good 3 hours has been wasted and thus affected my medical appointment. I do not recommend using Silkair, just go for other budget airlines, it just doe not worth the money paying premium and yet getting such lousy service!

### "Pretty decent flight"
Singapore to Davao. Pretty decent flight with a very well organized crew! Happy to serve and with a smile from crew members. The style of the seats is a bit old fashioned (color of the seats). There is no entertainment on the plane but you can connect to the WiFi and get the movies on your device, but only if you have the SilkAir app! Silk air should let us know in advance before you get a 5:30h flight.

### "Worst experience in my life"
Singapore to Kathmandu. The seat was so dirty and cover was stained. The food I was given was Rice and potato. No veggies no meat no fruits. Is it because Nepal is poor country? Also, no internet and no video surfing in the flight. Worst experience in my life.

### "not recommend this airline"
Singapore to Cairns. I would not recommend this airline. What a disappointment considering they are affiliated to Singapore Airlines which are great. Firstly the seating feels the way it looks. Must be the worst looking interior, old badly maintained (seat pockets were broken on both flights), the seats were super uncomfortable, the food was terrible and the flights were late on both occasions. Silk Air will not see me again.

### "SilkAir is shockingly bad"
Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. SilkAir flight departed late due to late arrival of incoming flight. When it was time to board, a hoard of people rushed to the gate. The announcement said business class and gold members first but the hoard was clearly neither. Staff did not bother to enforce the boarding process and didn’t even check the boarding passes of most passengers. Boarding of SilkAir is like a bogan fest of people without manners. On board, the seats are old. My seat has basically outworn it’s upholstery. The toilet is tiny and disgusting. Even upon boarding, the toilet smelled like it was full of stale pee. In flight, the plane was blowing hot air until the plane had enough altitude. One drink service of coffee, tea or juice. Overall, SilkAir is shockingly bad. I am glad to hear Singapore Airlines replacing SilkAir.

### "It's not worth it"
Not Verified |  Brisbane to Singapore via Cairns. Short staffed, so poor food service, seats and plane was worn-out with major wear and tear. Small plane need to use own phone for in flight entertainment for 6.5 hour flight with nowhere to charge your phone. I wouldn't even give 1* for this flight. It's better to book flight with no stopover in regional areas even if I have to pay $300 extra. It's not worth it.

### "Do not expect too much"
Singapore to Penang. For this short one hour flight to Penang, Silkair uses the A320 in a 3x3 configuration in economy, SilkAir is the regional branch of Singapore Airlines. A snack of curry puff and a drink was served on this flight. I had the exit row so the leg room was generous. There is no inflight entertainment. You have to download the Silkair Studio app and stream videos and music on your mobile device. So remember to bring along your earphones if you want to use the IFE. Do not expect too much on short regional flights on SilkAir and you will not be disappointed.

### "the worst business class seat"
Chengdu to Singapore. Absolutely the worst business class seat I have  experienced. The width of the 2x2 first 3 rows is acceptable, but the legroom is absolutely appalling - less even than I would expect in a normal premium economy seat. Plus limited recline, circa 30 degrees from vertical, upon which when the person in the seat in front of you is reclined you have even less space to maneuver in and out and are pretty much forced to recline yourself to retain a semblance of spacing. Added to which the seat controls for recline, footrest, lumber massage are really stiff mechanical levers. For a brand new plane absolutely abysmal! There is  no in flight entertainment in the seat backs. In business one is issued with an iPad which can stream movies etc. through the Silk Air WiFi. This does not support Internet connectivity, only the IFE. If you want to use your own device you need to have previously installed the Silk Air app from the app store - something nobody tells you before you board. In the cramped seat space there is very little place to put the iPad, even on the little plastic prop available on request, so one ends up holding it whilst also trying to juggle a meal or whatever. No noise cancelling headphones, just cheap in-ear buds, so I plugged my own noise cancellers in to the iPad. No capability to connect via Bluetooth of course. I found it impossible to doze on the 4.5 hours midnight flight so tried to pass the time with the limited selection of English language films on the iPad. Literally the only redeeming feature of the whole miserable experience was the cabin crew who try their best to give high quality and attentive service. I feel sorry for them having to pretend that they represent a proper business class operation, which this manifestly is not.

### "an incredible disappointment"
Singapore to Cairns. Best descent and landing, however this does not detract from awful experience. 6 hours with no inflight entertainment, cramped seating, appalling food and limited access to facilities which when needed where very unhygienic and unpleasant to use. It was an incredible disappointment having booked with Singapore Airlines to ensure a quality flight from the UK - this truly spoilt it. I would advise folks to avoid this route

### "ride was uncomfortable"
Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. The boarding time stated was 1.30pm but after accumulating nearly a full plane load of passengers in the queue, a change of gate was announced at 1.50pm. We boarded late, which ended up in a late departure. On board, the seats were acceptable with good recline. However, we were on board with a huge group of Chinese tourists, they reclined seats before take off, get up to go to the toilets whilst the plane is taking off, stood up and got their bags before the plane stopped. Cabin crew tried their best to control the mayhem but simply gave up towards the end of the ride. The ride was uncomfortable and felt dangerous due to safety violations of passengers. Although many things are out of SilkAir’s control, I think it would be good if SilkAir gives proper training to the air stewardesses who make announcements. We can never really understand what they are saying because they either fake an American accent but do it so badly that their words are all jumbled up and unclear.

### "was not really comfortable"
Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Boeing 737s are always a bad plane to board, so this wasn’t comfortable but this is the same for every 737 flight. Boarding was very strange. We were asked taken to board via bus - but oh my, how we were packed in. Flight was not really comfortable as the plane did not cool down enough. Drink service only - coffee, tea, juice or water. Good that it is such a short flight though.

### "SilkAir is really very ordinary"
Cochin to Singapore. The positive is that we left and arrived in good time. However the price does not justify what you actually get. Premium price, very old plane with no personal screens. Note you can download their app to watch a variety. The food was dreadful. Served at something like midnight, I opened the foil and recoiled. It was that bad. Fortunately I kept dropping off to sleep which helped the flight pass faster. Overall if I was choosing this route in future I would just go with the cheapest option as SilkAir is really very ordinary.

### "It delays all the time"
Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. Terrible. It delays all the time as normal LCCs do. They tend to being a little better than the other LCC but it has nothing different. No one apologize for the inconvenience caused by the flight. I don't know why I should take this LCC though I purchase ticket from Singapore Airline all the time. There is significant difference between the two brand and it causes obvious minus for the customers paid premium. Please don't use the poor option because of cheap cost.

### "customer service is the worst"
Manado to Singapore with SilkAir in October 2018. Singapore Airlines may be the best airline in the world but its customer service is surely the worst! I called the customer service on 2 different occasions. In both occasions, it was not long until a representative picked up the call, but soon after I shared my enquiries, I was asked to wait for unreasonably long. And while waiting, I was put on hold. In the first occasion, I was put on hold for 46 minutes. Today, I was put on hold for 22 minutes when the whole call was 27 minutes! I wonder what took them so long to find my reservation. Lesson: Never ever call the SIA Customer Service. You may have saved some time by going to their office instead. I have done it a few times. The SIA office is far more efficient than the customer service line.

### "in need of a re-branding"
SilkAir is a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines. It recently started a 4-weekly service to Busan, South Korea. The outbound flight is a red eye flight which arrived early the next morning. As it was a late night flight, only drinks and snacks were served after take off. A simple breakfast was served before arriving into Busan. There is no personal inflight entertainment system on the B737-800. Instead, passengers have to stream movies and music over their personal devices via the SilkAir Studio app. The problem is that if you do not have earphones, you won’t be able to listen to the soundtrack. There is an overhead TV screen showing Korean comedy series. Nobody was paying attention to the TV as most passengers were asleep. I was seated in the exit row so the leg space was generous. However, the same cannot be said of the other rows. Being a service to Korea, there was a Korean flight attendant among the 4 serving the economy cabin. They were pleasant and efficient but somehow lacked the finesse of their counterparts in Singapore Airlines. SilkAir will be absorbed into its parent company Singapore Airlines in due course. It is in need of a re-branding and overhaul to its cabin product.

### "suitcase delayed for one week"
I had the worst experience with SilkAir flying from Singapore to Dili-Timor. Not only my suitcase was delayed for one week, as they initially refused to take responsibility and pay any kind of expense. Silkair's representation in Dili did not contact me once with information on the location of the baggage. After more than one month of discussing this issue with costumer service, I was offered the compensation of 75 dollars as a token of apology for spending a week in Dili without suitcase on a business trip.

### "bad punctuality"
Surabaya to Singapore. Bad airline, bad punctuality, not worth the price. Silkair has always prided themselves to be able to get the passengers to the destination on time. However after multiple times of boarding their flights, paying top dollars compared to other airlines,  this airline is not worth the money. Cabin is at most average. It is clean, but it is not exquisite. Service is standard. But the biggest disappointment has always that they are late.

### "A very good airline"
Flew SilkAir from Penang to Singapore. A very good airline with friendly cabin crew members. Foods and drinks provided on this flight are basic but it's still quite delicious and enjoyable to eat.

### "Such a disappointment"
Flight was delayed initially from 9.15pm to 9.45pm, then became 10.15pm. No water or snacks given for the delay, only apologies. I chose Silk Air expecting to be punctual whilst other budget airlines serving Singapore to Penang route all boarded on time. Such a disappointment. Seat was ok and good enough for a  short flight. SilkAir has no personal IFE. Cabin crews were not bad. Food is terrible, only a wrap with fruits (the real fruits are only 3 slices of watermelon while oranges are sweetened can ones). It is ok to buy this flight if there is a promotion, if not better buy budget airlines.

### "the service is satisfied"
Singapore to Wuhan. In general the service is satisfied. However, I can't agree that it's value of money. The price level of SilkAir is almost as its parent company Singapore Airline, but the cabin service is too far away from what its price suggests. I ordered noodle in this flight and the taste was plain. The only memorable thing was they do serve ice-cream. And the seat space was as narrow as budget airline. I couldn't believe that's what a Singapore Airline full service subsidiary looks like.

### "fine for a short flight"
Singapore to Luang Prabang. Knowing ahead we had downloaded the SilkAir entertainment on our iPads as it would have been a boring 3 hr flight. We boarded efficiently and the aircraft left on time. Not so slick as their parent company Singapore Air, and the cabin felt old and basic however it was fine for a short flight. The refresher towels were cold and in a pack. We were given a meal, it was not very nice but that wasn’t important. We returned from Vientiane and again it was okay, Not special but we got there and returned with no stress.

### " very slow but friendly"
Singapore to Male. Lounge in Singapore was very crowded, food choice was ok but quality not great. Very weak internet connection. Boarding was efficient. Very old and dated aircraft with old recliner seats, for almost 5 hours flight not great. Service was not convincing, very slow but friendly. Food ok but not really good, more like Economy Class food. I would choose them only if no better option available, hopefully they will invest when they integrate into SQ.

### "the flight was half empty"
Singapore to Kota Kinabalu. Early morning departure flight from Singapore, flight crew were on their first leg and looked fresh and cheerful. Going out on the Boeing 737-800 and the flight was half empty, hence was lucky enough to have the side seats free which no doubt contributed to the overall sense of luxury. SilkAir B737's are decked out in an airy, light decor but the seats are a little bit spartan, with only the drop-down table and a large expanse of plastic moulding, which allows you to store any loose items you wish (and no doubt, forget about them when you depart). Legroom is adequate, if nothing to write home about, but certainly bit better than budget airlines, while the B737 is always a more width constrained than the A320. Pre flight service included face towels (disposable packets) and offers of newspapers. Despite a half full flight, they had run out of meal choices by the time they reached me, but small matter, the food was never going to be the reason to fly, anyway. Entertainment was via SilkAir Studio - bring your own electronic device, and stream via wifi. I was slightly amused to see that the music choices hadn't changed at all in the last 6 months, though I would guess that the movie options must have changed. The biggest downside is the limited toilet capacity at the rear - small, cramped, and if you are on a full flight, there will be endless queues. Not so on this flight, though, and we landed on time, uneventfully.

### "A nice regional airline"
Penang to Singapore. A nice regional airline that shares the relative same standards or at least approach as its big sister, Singapore airlines. Cabin staff speedy and attentive. A small breakfast pastry and fruit with coffee served on a short hope one hour flight. Captain kept us updated particularly for those with short connecting windows. Planes a bit old and shabby but apparently large investment coming soon to this small airline.

### "non arrival of my bag"
Davao to Singapore. I have had no problem with Silk Air until 6 October when I was returning from Davao. The trip was fine as normal, however somehow my luggage, one bag, did not leave Davao airport in spite of checking in almost 32 hours before take off and seeing my bag complete with baggage stickers having been applied by check in staff and seeing the bag depart on the carousel. The non arrival of my bag at Auckland Airport caused me no end of distress as aside from clothing it contained my toiletries and important medication.

### "was really impressed"
Based in Germany. I flew with Silkair in economy from Phuket to Singapore on September 22th, 2018. For only one hour and a half flight (short haul flight), I must admit that I was really impressed about the very good service on board. We had two complete menus to choose and many kind of drinks for free. Enough space between the seats and the stewardesses was really friendly. Unlike for flights within Europe, I am no more used to that. We usually get at least a small sandwich or snack. By low cost airline, we need to pay extra if we want to get something to drink or eat. It was great pleasure for me to take this airline.

### "need to step up their game"
Colombo to Singapore. The check in at Colombo was extremely pleasant and the agent went above and beyond to ensure I had the seats I wanted, however this was the end of anything good about Silk Air. I found the crew to be robotic, unfriendly and rude. Meal service is mediocre. The worst part about Silk Air is that there is no entertainment, besides the app. Silk Air has disappointed me in the past but this trip with them is my final one. The cabin ambiance is depressing and they need to step up their game.

### "friendly and efficient"
Singapore to Kota Kinabalu, my first experience of the SilkAir B737-800 product. Boarding was by zone number, and uncomplicated. I had the luxury of an empty seat next to me, so that made a difference when I took my seat. First impression was of fairly simple but clean-looking cabin environment. Seat backs were sculpted plastic and very basic, with only the tray table and a deep plastic pocket to lose your belongings in. The B737 always strikes me as a rather more cramped cabin than the A320; and so it turned out when checking Seatguru, with 1 inch less pitch and seat width than the A320. We were given cool towelettes and offered newspapers before takeoff, and a hot meal appeared (chicken spaghetti, which proved a bit difficult to eat for obvious reasons). Entertainment is available by the SilkAir Studio, and the choice of music proved disappointingly poor, although more movies appeared available. Service was generally friendly and efficient, and we landed feeling at least half human.

### "would not recommend this airline"
Myself and my husband booked a flight from Singapore to Cairns. We believed that we were flying with Singapore Airlines (the price reflected this). Then we got on the plane and there was no onboard entertainment. Let me clarify. There were a couple of screens throughout the plane with Asian entertainment. No headsets were offered. The cabin crew were not accommodating and when asked for a drink (Diet Coke) I was made to feel like this was an imposition. Further to this they returned with a cup. Not even a can. The first offer of a drink other than an orange juice or water was at least 4 hours into the flight. I would not recommend this airline. I am disappointed as I have travelled with this airline multiple times and always had a great experience.

### "nothing has changed in 5 months"
Flew with Silk Air to Colombo from Singapore for the second time this year and nothing has changed in 5 months. The food is palatable but insufficient and nothing exceptional. Aircraft mainainance is practically non existent. There is no inflight entertainment except that you can purchase the Silk Air studio app and watch a limited range of a fairly pathetic selection of movies. The flight crew however are very friendly and can be chatted with easily. In short, Silk Air should not charge its premium fare because it is practically a budget airline with free meals and marginally better legroom. In conclusion a dissapointing experience and forgettable to say the least.

### "we would fly with them again"
Not Verified |  We flew SilkAir from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur on May 7th. Newspaper given on aircraft, comfortable seats for my wife and I near wing. Attentive crew, refreshing towels handed out. A short flight, nearing Kuala Lumpur we struck turbulance causing the plane to drop slightly. The flight attendants immediately sat in seats in front of us, staying there until we landed No announcement from flight deck. Overall a great flight, clean plane, good service, Our return flight to Singapore was on May 16th. Once again a good flight, short, no complaints We enjoyed this airline, and we would fly with them again.

### "it was a pleasant flight"
Not Verified |  Singapore to Luang Prabang. Legroom is ok for this aircraft, however taller people will have slight difficulty. But is was understandable for A320 economy seats. Crew were attentive. Meal serving was sufficient for this route. A hot meal, followed by ice cream as dessert. Pea snacks before landing. There’s no personal screen, and you have to use your own tablets or phone. Entertainment selection on SilkAir studio was limited and not latest, however good enough to keep you occupied throughout the flight. For Apple user, remember to download their app first before boarding to enjoy the entertainment. Overall, it was a pleasant flight, given the amount you paid for.

### "my luggage was broken"
Penang to Singapore. I was arriving to Singapore on the delayed MI349 on last Saturday (12-May-2018). I always trust SIA would handle my baggage properly as compared to other airlines. While getting my luggage covered with luggage cover, and with my trust with SIA companies, I did not check my baggage when I was still inside the airport. I took a Grab home, took my dinner before I was to unpack my stuffs. I got terribly shocked to look at how my luggage was broken. When I opened the cover, it is all cracked inside from the adjustable handler until down 30% of my luggage. I did not place much stuffs inside my luggage, but spare luggage and clothes. I contacted the customer service through the online form provided on the same night, and followed up again on 16-May-2018 (Wednesday), no news from SilkAir at all! I have tried to call SilkAir, but keep getting the wrong information online. It is one week since I last arrived and complained now. Still no sign of following up. The fare is not justifying on what we can get.

### "the staff work slowly"
Penang to Singapore. So disappointed for Silkair, as it's slogan "Joy to fly", but I do not agree to that. This is mainly because the cabin crew are not nice, it doesn't deserve as a best regional airline. Penang is one of the most important route for Silkair, however, the ground service only open 2 hours before the fight, the staff open the counter 10mins later and the staff work slowly, I am Silver elite for Singapore Airline and already web check in, but the staff use more than 10 mins to handle my luggage and give me the passport. For the food, only provide a sandwich. I take AirAsia from SIN to Penang, the experience is much better even it's low cost airline.

### "Crews are great"
Singapore to Manado. Both flights are on reasonably new Boeing 737-800. Crews are great and nothing is too troublesome for them. I ordered the meals from “All-time favorite” menu in advance and are very satisfied with quality and quantity on both flight. Toilet are kept clean and dry at all time and I believe that it was clean after every usage. Lounge in Manado has changed to Concordia lounge which is fantastic comparing to Bunaken lounge in my previous journey. Outgoing flight show quiet comedy on the screen, while the returning flight provide iPad to everyone as they want to keep cabin dark for passengers who choose to sleep. Some negative point is that seat in the 737 seemed to have less seat pitch, less recline and less comfortable than their A320 fleet, and the aircraft of my returning flight is not properly cleaned. There are a lot of black dust on air condition vent, crevices and even on overhead monitor.

### "Budget airline service for premium airline price"
Flew Kathmandu to Singapore. Budget airline service for premium airline price. As part of Singapore Airlines you pay full SQ price but get nothing like the service. No PEV - download and use their garbage application which simply didn’t work. To be honest I would fly Thai Airlways via BKK. It might be longer in terms of time, however it’s far more comfortable than being crammed into Silk Air. 5 hours on Silk Air passes very slowly indeed. As Krisflyer Gold I would chose Thai Air and Malaysia Airlines over this lot.

### "service on board are good"
Yogyakarta to Singapore. Flight was on schedule. Most of service on board are good, with enough food and beverages. In flight entertainment has to use own mobile phone, but we have to download the application before on board, because no internet connection on board to download the application by apple store or google play. Airlines need to give more advance information about it before boarding. WiFi on board is only for the in flight entertainment but no internet connection.

### "A few fails on this flight"
Siem Reap to Singapore. Single aisle aircraft, cvery cramped economy seats. Flight departed and arrived on time. Crew member instructions to 3 of us sitting in an exit row were unintelligible. They then dropped the overhead screens and tried to show something that nobody could discern what it was, primarily because they hadn't issued any headsets. Also two separate and polite requests tor arrival cards were ignored as none were handed out. A few fails on this flight.

### "they will change a plane"
Took the 7.55pm flight Singapore to Kuala Lumpur on 7 March. The gate was changed less than an hour from the departure time. There was no one at the initial gate to re-direct the passengers. Only an announcement over the PA system which could have easily been missed. Later, we were informed that there had been a change in plane, therefore change in gate. At the new gate, a plane awaits us. We boarded the plane at the original boarding time. Upon boarding, it was instantaneous that one could feel the air con in the aircraft wasn't working. The entire plane was stuffy. With that poor ventilation and stuffiness, the airline should not have allowed passengers to board. The ordeal begins thereafter, and an entire plane of passengers were left in the stuffy aircraft for the next 3+ hours. In between, a passenger who wasn't feeling well was escorted out. Remaining passengers were left fanning themselves furiously. Though the pilot had the aircon restarted twice, it was obvious that was not in a state good enough to keep the aircraft less stuffy. Air stewardess and stewards could only keep serving iced water and refreshing towels. It was a pathetic state. When asked, the air stewards and stewardess looked clueless on what's going on. After a couple of tries and taxi-ing off from the gate, the pilot and engineers realised that it is not going to work. We were told that they will change a plane at close to 11pm. The next plane was scheduled to depart at 11.30pm. There were further delays to the 11.30pm. First they told us it's 5 minutes delay and we will be allowed to board at 11.35pm. But that was not the end of it. We finally begin boarding only at close to 12am. After we got off the aircraft with the faulty aircon, we were given a pack with pathetic food. Just before we board the replacement flight, we were given a slip of paper telling us that there is free wifi at the airport and we can notify our friends and family of the delay if they are waiting for us at KLIA. Thanks but no thanks. Already too late. Just when we are boarding and we are required to switch of our phones? Brainless move. Good job SilkAir, and good luck.

### "choose this airline again"
Siem Reap to Singapore. SilkAir + free access to Plaza Premium Lounge was good while waiting on REP airport which so crowded and stressful. Everything smooth during the flight and nothing to complain for this regional airline from SQ. Definitely choose this airline again for routes that’s only provided by them (not SQ)

### "Ground staff were very helpful"
Colombo to Singapore on the 737 was acceptable given the duration of the flight. As a regional carrier however, SilkAir fails to meet the mark. Aircraft had dirt on the seat. Catering was barely palatable but acceptable given the regional status. Service nothing special with some staff being nicer than the others. Ground staff at both ends were very helpful.

### "limitations of the aircraft"
Cairns to Singapore. This was a long and tiring flight on a Boeing 737. SilkAir tries to make the best of a bad situation but the sad truth is that a 7 hour flight requires flat bed seats in Business class and that can be accomplished only in a bigger aircraft like a 777. The seats do not recline enough to withstand a 7 hour flight. The lounge at Cairns is compact but sufficient. The in flight attendants were good but were again stymied by the limitations of the aircraft. There is very limited in flight entertainment. SilkAir must either operate the 777 on this segment or simply hand over this route to Singapore Airlines.

### "Excellent flights on time"
We flew with SilkAir from Singapore to Koh Samui return as the last part of our trip from Greece to Thailand. Excellent flights on time, friendly FA and two choices of meal offered on this 1.5 hours of flight. Inflight entertainment just adequate

### "in-flight entertainment is available"
Singapore to Siem Reap. Flight was about half full, with most passengers seated at the front of the aircraft. Short videos are played from the overhead screens. The crew also announced that SilkAir Studio, the airline's wireless in-flight entertainment is available for this flight. Movies, short films and music options are ample for this short flight time of approximately two hours. Charging ports are available between seats. Only one breakfast option was available with a choice of drink. Meal trays were cleared soon after prior to arrival into Siem Reap.

### "crew were not friendly"
Took SilkAik flight on 21 Augustfrom Siem Reap back to Singapore. The crew were not friendly and not attentive to passenger. Their attitude was rude especially when clearing the trays from us, without even asking. No smiling faces at all.

### "Seats were comfortable"
Half full daytime flight from SIN-CTU with SilkAir. Seats were comfortable with typical economy spacing. No seatback IFE, instead you logged into the aircraft WiFi (no internet) to download an Android APK for their Studio app. Not exactly the most efficient means for anyone not technically minded. The Apple version is available in the app store. Even so, once logged on there was a limited choice of movies, about 8 per genre, and music. Very paired down compared to the Singapore Airline parent IFE. Meal was also a simplified choice of either of two dishes. However drinks were plentiful and free flowing through the whole flight. The quality of the staff was the equivalent of SQ, so no complaints there. My return flight was a full overnight flight, slept most of the way, so was uneventful.

### "friendly and efficient"
I was impressed by my SilkAir flight from Singapore to Koh Samui. Check in was easy. The plane left on time and the service was both friendly and efficient. For a short flight there was a very tasty meal as well. The wine served was very good as well. I was impressed that they offered me another glass of wine! Very little IFE, but it was no big deal on such a short flight.

### "quality of service is missing"
SilkAir is a sister airline of Singapore Airlines but the similar quality of service is missing. The flight from Singapore to Kolkata was delayed and so was arrival at the destination though the weather was good so some makeup was possible. Very smooth flight but seats are a bit cramped. Food served (dinner) was good though a limited choice. The crew were very friendly and kept attending to every passenger. Toilets were clean and had the basic amenities. However I would prefer the actual SQ airline service over the Silk Air, makes one feel a bit cheated if you have booked the entire flight on SQ.

### "seats were very worn"
Chiang Mai to Singapore. Departure and arrival was on-time with no incidents to report. Staff was friendly and attentive. The cabin interior, however, had seen better days, and the seats were very worn. Also, leg space was on the tight side with seating size and comfort similar to a budget airline.

### "Lots of corporate double talk"
Recently I flew Silkair Cairns to Surabaya return via Singapore. On the Cairns to Singapore leg I was seated next to an obese person who intruded as much as 15cm into my seat. I had booked and paid for an exit row because of my height. I am 192cm, 90kg fit and healthy 71yo. I continually asked him to keep to his own seat but it was impossible for him. If he leaned forward his stomach forced his legs into my seat squab. He threatened to punch me. I reported the threat to the attendants and they spoke to him. I was offered a middle standard seat which I had to refuse because of my height. He could have easily been moved to the business section which was occupied by only one staff member passenger. I wrote to them asking for a FOC on only the CNS-SIN sector next time I fly to Eastern Indonesia but they offered a free exit seat CNS-SIN-CNS. Lots of corporate double talk and insincere apologies. If you buy a car and it has no motor you can ask for and get a replacement. I purchased a seat and only got 66% of it and I want a replacement.

### "a worthy and solid performer"
Singapore to Luang Prabang return in April, with a stopover in Vientiane on the outgoing leg to Laos. Second time on SilkAir this year and I was very pleased with the service to Luang Prabang. Check-in went without a hitch and boarding for the flight was quick as it was a low load on the Singapore to Vientiene sector. I was served a total of six times on my flight to Luang Prabang by a very cheerful bunch of cabin attendants - snacks, drinks, wine, meals desserts etc! The main meal of chicken pasta was alright but I wish they didn't skimp on the salad. Flight wasn't full so I had lots of room to stretch. Arrival in Luang Prabang was on time even with the slight delay in Vientiane. On the return flight it was a direct trip to Singapore without a stopover - this time round I think they were running short of wine as they only served this in a cup and didn't give out bottles. The main meal was seafood pasta, which was way better than the lunch I got. Once again, they skimped on the salad. Inflight entertainment was quirky and the app crashed a lot. Good thing that I got newspapers on both legs of the journey. All in all the cabin crew service was top notch and I really felt that they provided a great service. This airline does have room for improvement, but I can say that SilkAir is still quite a worthy and solid performer.

### "a positive experience"
Kuala Lumpur to Singapore on SilkAir. Departure on time. Plane was new a Boeing 737-800. Usb ports were available under the seat. Crew was polite. No snack was served during the 45 min. flight, only drinks. Onverall a positive experience both way in and out. Would fly again.

### "cabin service exceeded my expectations"
Singapore - Penang - Singapore in late March and early April. SilkAir's cabin service exceeded my expectations. Boarding on both legs were orderly and efficient. On both the outbound and inbound flight we had some really friendly and cheerful cabin crew who'd go out of the way to help their passengers. Refreshments on the two flights were served as soon as the flights were airborne, and the sandwiches served were tasty. Seats on both flights were comfortable enough for the short one hour journey each way with sufficient pitch and width. Outgoing flight to Penang had a late departure but on time arrival, but the return flight left the gate ten minutes early and arrived in Singapore well ahead of schedule. If there's one area where I was dissatisfied it would be the inflight entertainment system which involves streaming content to mobile devices or computers. Android users (like myself) have to download the SilkAir IFE app in order to log on to the entertainment system, and by the time I got it running properly on the outbound flight the aircraft was ready to land. On the return flight the inflight entertainment app worked well for a while, until it started to crash while playing certain songs. All in all, I'm happy with the SilkAir experience, but I can't give them full marks for the IFE - I really hope they are able to make their inflight entertainment system more user-friendly in future.

### "all around great"
❎ Unverified |  I flew from Phnom Penh to Singapore on SilkAir and it was all around great. The staff were friendly. One positive thing about is its seats, they feel soft and amazing legroom, and the food was very tasty. I had a tomato pasta with fish and it tasted very decent. Also the flight entertainment was enjoyable. The flight was very smooth and relaxing. I would recommend it.

### "good in flight service"
Singapore to Yogyakarta. Very comfortable seats, only 31 inch pitch but seats are not thick so space between seats seems more than normal. Good in flight service, meal and drinks (beer and soft drinks etc. but no wine). Staff are professional and readily assist when needed. Overall good value and efficient airline.

### "in-flight services were very good"
Surabaya to Singapore return. It was our first time flying SilkAir's newest Boeing 737-800. This new aircraft has Sky Interior design which is very beautiful and relaxing. Our flight to Surabaya took-off on time and landed ahead of schedule by 10 minutes. The ground staff at Changi International Airport was very helpful when she gave us assistance to use the Self Check-in kiosk for the first time. It was quite simple to use. After a few clicks you can print out your boarding pass as well as your luggage tag then you can proceed to the check-in counter to drop your luggage. However, we had a minor problem when we dropped our bags at the check-in counter, an agent told us only two out of three bags were registered. Then that agent helped us to recheck-in our three bags altogether. The in-flight services were very good and the meals had nice taste. Once we landed at Juanda International Airport, there was another minor problem with the baggage delivery. We were told our baggage would be delivered from carousel number 4 and waited for about 10 minutes before it then moved to carousel number 3 . Again, it took ages to get our bags delivered; there were approximately 10-15 minutes intervals to collect all the three luggage. It was not Silk Air's fault but the delivery system at Juanda which needs to be sorted out.

### "SilkAir comes up short"
Singapore to Coimbatore return. Check-in was efficient but the staff member was rather haughty in her dealings with us until she discovered our class of travel. A family travelling in Economy Class was rudely turned away from the Business Class line, leaving a bad impression. The SilverKris lounge in Terminal 3 was comfortable but unimpressive, though the staff were excellent. SIN-CJB flight was in SilkAir's newest Boeing 737-800 (9V-MGQ) and the flight back was in their oldest one (9V-MGA). The former was in a very good condition but the latter, despite being less than three years old, had many scuffs throughout the cabin. The service was not quite as polished as on Singapore Airlines, though this was because of the constraints of the hard product. The cabin crew were friendly and attentive, always ready to attend to the passengers while remaining unobtrusive. Meal service with a welcome drink and light snack before a three-course meal later in the flight. The meals were not as extravagant as those served by other airlines in Business Class, but were sufficient. I appreciated the small touches such as the festive cookies served with the snack and chocolates served after the main meal. The superb cabin crew were let down by the poor product. The seat, though spacious, had manual controls which seized up frequently. My seat (2A) did not recline at all. A tablet (an iPad on the outbound flight to CJB and a Lenovo on the return leg) was provided together with a pair of disposable earphones to access SilkAir's wireless IFE but the selection was paltry and the audio was drowned out by the ambient noise. Furthermore, the lack of a tablet holder made using the IFE system for prolonged periods difficult. With a price of almost SGD 2500 return per traveller, and given that several other airlines in the region (such as Dragonair, Qatar Airways and Malindo Air) have superior product and service onboard similar aircraft, SilkAir comes up short.

### "Very disappointing"
Singapore to Kunming. Very disappointing for a full service airline and not worth being called the regional wing of Singapore Airlines. Seats were very similar in space and comfort to budget carriers such as Jetstar. I am 190cm tall and my knees were really digging into the seat in front of me. Not what you would expect of a full service airline. Although the Boeing 737-800 was less than a year old, the seats were already showing signs of wear - greying and tattered. For a 4hr flight to Kunming this was almost unbearable. Food was also not up to standard. I would expect a full meal service from SilkAir on such a long flight. However the meal was very small and barely enough for this sector. There are only 2 toilets available for the 150-odd passengers in economy. Together with the slow meal service, this caused the rear of the aircraft to be constantly congested. I feel sorry for those seated in the vicinity of the toilet as they had to deal with people squeezing in the narrow aisle and eating into their already limited personal space. Inflight entertainment is also poor. Not only is there no in seat IFE, the wifi IFE system is also very limited in content. The content that it did have was not recent nor popular. Worst of all, the prices paid for the flight are full Singapore Airlines fares and that sours the whole experience. SilkAir is far from the standard of Singapore Airlines and that should not be the case.

### "substandard service from SilkAir"
Took Silkair from Okinawa to Singapore. Cabin crew was impatient, refused to pick up empty cups and food trays without wearing gloves and having trash bags with them. The 5 hour flight is on a small aircraft with only 2 washrooms. There is always a long queue. Cabin crew is very impatient with passengers who are in the queue. Food was insufficent and poor. Depart and return trip was almost identical. Chicken with rice, fish with potatoes. Very small quantities. Watermelon and pineapple was warm instead of cold. A budget airline or a full service airline with transit is better than getting substandard service from SilkAir.

### "never use SilkAir"
Chiang Mai to Singapore with SilkAir. We've been traveling in SE Asia for 2 months and are heading back to the US today. On a separate ticket, we're flying to Singapore this morning on tickets purchased through Singapore Airlines online. As a Platinum Premier member on Star Alliance, my family and I are allowed 50kg each. Singapore Airlines confirmed this was accurate in an email. So, we packed accordingly. However, as the flight was operated by SilkAir and they allow only 30kg each. The ticketing agents at Chiang Mai airport are only contractors and are completely unempowered to make any decisions. The Silk Air supervisor, made a ridiculous attempt to call someone to get permission and could only tell me no and that he was sorry, which I appreciated only slightly, but sorry didn't solve our problem. We had 10kg too much and he was not budging. Finally, we unloaded as much as we could into carry-on bags and we we're still 4kg over. He would not budge. Any amount of reasoning would not work. Finally, he whimpered off and hid from me. The contract agent, who was embarrassed, finally just told him it was at weight and put our bags through. Icing on the cake: the agent told us to always choose Thai Airways and never use SilkAir, which is exactly what we'll do.

### "demonstrating good service "
My husband and I were onboard flight MI124 25 Nov 2016, from Singapore to Lombok when we were served by a flight steward who displayed exemplary service - outstandingly attentive and a positive sense of humour. He paid meticulous attention to our meal requests, and saw that we were adequately hydrated. He made our flight a very memorable and enjoyable one, epecially for my husband, who has a low tolerance to flight travels. Thank you for demonstrating what good service and attitude is.

### "service is quite good"
Singapore to Bandung. I call SlikAir "premium-lowfare" because my base is in South East Asia, so my choice is SilkAir rather than AirAsia for low cost. The service is quite good, seat comfort is standard, the entertaiment is accesible on your own device, and they served food too. The cabin crew also nice.

### "movie and entertainment choices limited"
Bandung to Singapore with SilkAir. The food was good, we had fresh salmon for our lunch. You need to use your personal devices in order to connect to the onboard entertainment system. Movie and entertainment choices limited. The aircraft looked old and interior not so great compare with the newer cabins.

### "satisfied with the experience"
Surabaya to Singapore. We flew SilkAir business class for the first time and really enjoyed it. Business class is a small cabin with 12 seats in total. The seats are quite large with generous recline. We were greeted by friendly check in agents at both airports in Sub and Sin. We were among the first passengers to board. The flight attendants were polite and helpful. They took order of our meals preference before take off. The meals itself were tasty. Upon arrival, we were among the first passengers to disembark from the aircraft. Very satisfied with the experience.

### "poor crisis management"
Flight was supposed to depart at 7.25pm on Sunday from Lombok to Singapore. We were told that there was a slight delay on the flight as the crew were checking the plane. The plane was delayed until 7.55 where there was supposed to be an update. 8.10 pm, no updates given. It wasn't until 8.30 pm that we were told there could be a technical fault on the plane and the pilot and ground crew would make a decision in 5 mins. At 8.50 pm we were told that the plane was not safe to take off. Without consulting Singapore HQ the ground crew have decided to put us up in a hotel. For the 200 plus people that were stranded, there wasn't clear communication. Convenient option was to send everyone to the hotel, even when everyone have Monday commitments. Terrible experience for the 200 people on board and poor crisis management by SilkAir.

### "no service quality at all"
Booked through SIA website and it turned out to be SilkAir flight to Xiamen. Regretted travelling with them as it turned out to be budget airline standard although you paid full fare. The cabin crew were stony-faced with no service quality at all. No head phones provided and no individual screen at all. Worse still, flight was late on arrival. Wish me luck with my return flight. Should have travelled with Xiamen Airlines which was cheaper.

### "seat pitch was very disappointing"
Flew Coimbatore to Singapore with SilkAir. Check-in was smooth, cabin was bright and refreshing. Crew were friendly. Seat pitch was very disappointing. It was as bad as any other budget airline. I had flown them a couple of times over the years, but always on their A320 or A319 - this was the first time on their new B737s. Will avoid them in future, for sure, just for this reason. Meal service could be quicker.

### "used to be a great little airline"
Davao to Singapore. SilkAir used to be a great little airline with good seat pitch, quality service and food/beverage options. Now I struggle to differentiate it from the low cost carriers. The only value proposition I see now for Silk air is connectivity to Singapore Airlines. Seat pitch seems little different to Cebu Pacific, request a beer and you get it poured half full into a small plastic cup with no refill offer. Food is bland and quantities reduced. I have flown this route periodically for 20 years and have gone from being a devotee of Silk Air to wondering why bother for the dollars paid.

### "nothing special but did the job"
Singapore to Penang. First time on SilkAir so did not know what to expect given the limited reviews. Check in was T2 and used the KrisFlyer lounge in T2 which is nowhere near as good as the lounge in T3. Flight was only about 55 minutes. Cabin crew do not have the same skills or level of service as that of Singapore Airlines. After the crew serve the meal they are more interested in talking to each other than attending to the passengers. Seats comfortable. Nothing special but did the job.

### "served refreshments very late"
Chennai to Singapore with SilkAir (MI435). Flight attendants served the refreshments and meal very late as there appeared to be many trainees. I had to wait for almost 3 hours to be asked by one of the flight attendant if I had been served. When I asked for vegetarian food, they said that all the vegetarian meals are over and only non-vegetarian is available. I asked if there was an alternative and they provided me with a cup noodles. They had totally missed out serving some seats - it was poor service.

### "disappointed with the service"
Chiang Mai to Singapore (MI705) and was so disappointed with the service. Was traveling back with a group of friends and we were sitting in the last fews rows. We could not get any rest on the way back because the staff were talking, joking and laughing so loudly. I understand at work the need to joke / socialise to pass time but I think this was way too much.

### "seat was comfortable"
Flew Singapore to Hanoi with SilkAir. Transited through Singapore, so no check in. Boarding was efficient. Cabin staff were very helpful in stowing hand luggage in overheads. Flight left on time. Seat was comfortable for a short flight. Meal served was good. Cabin staff had limited English, but did their best to be helpful.

### "pricey for a short haul flight"
Singapore - Medan, MI234, 16 April 2016, 6C. Transit in Singapore. Checked-in from the previous destination. Ground service was a little bit disappointing, they had changed my seats without notifying me by email or phone and because I already had my boarding pass from the previous destination I did not go to the transfer counter. However, I did not have any passengers in the middle and window seat so I could see the view and easily get out for toilet without disturbing other passengers. The seat was good and new. The cabin crews were okay. I tried the IFE by WiFi as this is one of their facilities onboard, it was great but had less choice. Food was decent for a short haul flight. Overall, it was great but pricey for a short haul flight.

### "budget airline quality"
Singapore to Kunming with SilkAir. Singapore Airlines price but budget airline quality - very disappointing. The seats are not comfortable as they are very small (like budget airline), food was not good  and there is hardly any inflight entertainment. Silkair should either reduce its price substantially or improve its quality to be comparable with Singapore Airlines. Unfortunately, a lot of the routes are only offered by Silkair so passengers like me have no choice. Otherwise, I would not travel by Silkair.

### "functional but lacked much polish"
SilkAir from Singapore to Yangon was noticeably inferior to my outbound Singapore Airlines flight. The seats are tightly packed, resulting in minimal legroom, and were not particularly comfortable. No AVOD, but entertainment screened on the communal video screens. Food was okay, and a choice of wine or beer was served. Cabin crew were professional and polite, but lacked enthusiasm. Overall, everything was functional but lacked much polish.

### "good service and adequate food"
Yangon to Singapore with SilkAir, and good service and adequate food. Crew was helpful and flight was on time. Seat pitch was a major problem, could not sit without touching back of front seat. Luckily crew assisted me and I could move to an emergency exit seat. I flew a few days before from Singapore to Mandalay in A320-200 and seat pitch was fine.

### "I'd happily use them again"
SilkAir from Singapore to Siem Reap and Phnom Penh to Singapore, connecting with Singapore Airlines flights to/from London. SilkAir is a decent regional carrier but doesn't quite match the standards of its parent company, Singapore Airlines. Both flights were on time, the outbound leg couldn't have been more than 30-40% full giving lots of room. The planes were clean and comfortable, service was provided with a smile. A meal on a short flight (2 hours) is a step up from regional European airlines. Landings were not the smoothest, but overall the flights were perfectly pleasant. There's nothing about SilkAir that totally wows me, but I'd happily use them again.

### "I will avoid flying SilkAir"
From Singapore to Okinawa onboard the charter flight and SilkAir has far service from SQ and some budget airlines. The plane was new and the seats was comfortable, but food was awful. The overhead entertainment screen was noise and won't allow me to sleep. Before landing, drinks and breakfast was served and the salmon was good. Arriving at the airport was waiting on the plane for 20 minutes. How can SQ offer better service and SilkAir is like a budget airline. ANA might be better than both. I will avoid flying SilkAir in the future.

### "enjoyable experience"
Short trip from Kuching to Singapore but enjoyable experience with SilkAir. Check in via the Singapore Air app on my iPhone the day before I fly. When I arrived at Kuching Airport, my check-in process was easy. The cabin crew friendly and warm. Egg sandwich served. The A319 is quite old and it would be great to see SilkAir with more new Boeing 737 aircraft that come with a USB port. SilkAir Studio worked on my iOS devices and watched some short TV shows. Overall it was a joy to fly with SilkAir.

### "like a budget carrier"
Singapore to Manado with SilkAir, and for an airline that operates short to medium haul services I was disappointed by the lack of entertainment available. Bring your own ipad and you get to watch maybe 6 ancient movies. As a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines I would expect more. Food was chicken spaghetti which was tough spaghetti and 2 chicken nuggets. I don't understand why SQ have such a great product and SilkAir is like a budget carrier.

### "food and beverage service was excellent"
The actual flight with Silkair from Danang to Singapore was fine but the business lounge in Danang was unpleasant. The was little choice of beverages or food. The main choices were quick noodles and dried biscuits - a very poor experience. In addition, we arrived 3 hours prior to our flight, as instructed, only to be told to wait 30 minutes for check in to open. Once inflight, the staff were great and the food and beverage service was excellent. Silkair at Danang needs to lift its game in its lounges, the service inflight was really good.

### "crew were good and professional"
Singapore to Lombok with SilkAir and problems with booking - slow response. Two to go promotion but at the last minute the second passenger became ill and unfit to fly with doctors letter, and after much deliberation and arguments I was allowed to fly without having to pay the extra amount they wanted me to in the first place. I was sent a late email to check in for flight, without the office calling to inform as promised. Ground staff at check in made me wait for a wheelchair assistant till last minute even though this was booked way in advance. Food served onboard was okay and the cabin crew were good and professional.

### "I still recommend SilkAir"
Singapore to Kuching, and I love the new uniform the SilkAir crew is wearing. I requested to change my seat and the ground staff at Changi Airport T2 helped me without much fuss. 4-star service from cabin crew, the inflight entertainment is pretty good. Works well on my iPhone 5c. Fair amount of entertainment considering SilkAir only operate short haul flights. Food was fine. Overall I still recommend SilkAir to others.

### "pleasant short flight"
SilkAir from Bandung to Singapore Changi SIN. Flight got overbooked. Got an upgrade to business class. Cabin crew polite just a bit rushed in the galley during meal service. All in all pleasant short flight, with great food and good choice of tea.

### "get what you paid for"
Short SilkAir flight from Singapore to Medan one way. The ground service at Changi airport were very professional and boarding was smooth. The seat was standard for short haul flight and the plane seems very well maintained. The meal was average but I didn't make a big deal out of it since it was a short flight. Even though it was short flight, they still provided entertainment service via wireless connection. This is my first time flying with Silk Air and I will fly with them in the future. The price is premium though but you will get what you paid for.

### "legroom was uncomfortable"
I recently flew from Cairns to Bangalore via Singapore with SilkAir return. The aircraft was new and had a modern interior. The legroom though for a 6hr flight from Cairns to Singapore was inadequate and uncomfortable. Also, I found that when asking for minor things like some water, the staff seemed uninterested and like I was putting them out. Also, poor selection of choice from the SilkAir Studio to watch a movie through the inflight wifi on your device. Food was ok and adequate, but took a very long time to be served, much longer than most Airlines I have flown. Some positives though is the convenience to get to India, especially from a regional city like Cairns, with only one stop instead of two, unlike before. Also the price of the ticket was very reasonable considering it was peak season for travel to India. Overall, though I may look to fly another carrier in the future as my overall experience with SilkAir was not that great. Would much prefer to stick to Singapore Airlines.

### "seats give adequate legroom"
The SilkAir flight from Singapore to Hanoi was enjoyable, however the distribution of meals was rather slow and unprofessional of the cabin crew. The seats give adequate legroom but lack PTVs and there were only small dropdown screens from above. The landing was really smooth though.

### "very uncomfortable flight"
Singapore to Darwin with SilkAir was a very uncomfortable flight I am a short person but the legroom was very tight. A German guy sitting across from me was 6ft tall and permanently had his knees buried in the seat in front. Leg room not designed for taller westerners even though we were travelling to a western country.

### "there was no entertainment"
Cairns to Singapore via Darwin, using SilkAir. I arrived at 09.30 for 11.15 flight, but they couldn't for some obscure reason, find my booking. I could see my name on list, but couldn't get a boarding pass. As I was leaving Australia permanently, I had one extra suitcase, until they informed me it would cost $940 US - my whole ticket only cost $640 AUD. Got boarding pass 3 minutes before takeoff. I booked online, and in seat selection, the only seat that showed as available was an exit row, so I had paid $52AUD extra for seat. I was told at airport that I couldn't have the seat as I use a walking cane, and no refund was available. Onboard there was no entertainment -  6 hours to Singapore, no music or tv. One hour from Darwin, I asked FA for a can of beer and she advised, sorry no beer. All I can say is that the cabin staff are friendly.

### "all in all a great experience"
I booked SilkAir as a business class deal from Hong Kong via Singapore. The aircraft is a small type, understandable for a short regional flight. It has 8 business class seats, interesting thing was, I happened to be be only one on board that day! Service was very attentive, choice of 2 hot breakfast, I chose the Malay option an was delicious. The seat is reclining type but is spacious and made of leather. A lenovo pad was provided to me for entertainment, plus the overhead TV. A very pleasant 2:30 hours went past before landing safeky at Yogyakarta airport. All in all a great experience.

### SilkAir customer review
The outbound flight from COK was on time and the crew were tolerant to us even though we were a bit late to get to the gate. The crew were friendly and the food was okay (had ordered an avml meal). The boeing sky interior was fantastic. The leg space was a bit small. Im around 6 foot and I was cramped. The crew were friendly and pleasant. The toilet was clean too. However I can't believe that they have no personal IFE screens and no headphones were provided either. I spent the 4 hour journey reading and sleeping. The inbound flight was pretty much the same as the the outbound but the seats were quite worn out. The worst thing was the food.

### SilkAir customer review
SilkAir isn't the best airline I've travelled with. COK-SIN was on time and the crew was tolerant even though we were a bit late getting to the gate. The crew were friendly and the food was okay (ordered an avml meal). The Boeing Sky Interior was fantastic. The leg space was small. I'm around 6ft and I was cramped up a bit. The crew were friendly and pleasant. The toilet was clean too. SilkAir had no personal IFE screens. They don't provide headphones either. I spent the 4 hour journey reading and sleeping. The inbound flight was pretty much the same as the the outbound. The worst thing was the food. It was horrible. It is an okay airline to travel with provided that it is the cheapest you get.

### SilkAir customer review
Our flight from Singapore to Kuala Lumpar was great. The flight is only 45mins but had a drink service, and WiFi - I didn't expect them to have this option. You can also listen to music, read about the airline and watch a small variety of movies. This seats were comfortable. The only disappointment was there was no snack with the drinks.

### SilkAir customer review
Check-in counters opened 2 hours before the flight and a queue formed as early as an hour before the counters opened. Being a PPS club member, was able to queue at business class queue even though I flew economy. The ground crew had a list of the names allowed to queue in the business class check in queue and those who were not flying business class or PPS club members were asked to queue in the economy class queue which made the line short. Ground crew and flight crew very friendly. Route was via Cebu and was invited to use the lounge in both Davao and Cebu which had decent food options. Flight crew very professional and friendly even though it was an almost full load in economy. One complaint is that they run out of food options early and those at the rear only had one choice of food left. Crew very apologetic but this is not the first time this happened on SilkAir (happened in my inbound leg to Davao too). Both food options were good though. Didn't try the entertainment system and most passengers chose to sleep through the flight. It was an enjoyable flight and am so glad that they have this very convenient connection between Singapore and Davao.

### SilkAir customer review
I went on MI599 bound for Kalibo. The service was excellent food and beverages were fairly good the seat pitch was excellent. The cabin crew service was excellent. I would suggest to add LED or AVOD personal TV screens as it was a 3.5 hour flight with not a lot of entertainment. Other than that I rate my experience 100%!

### SilkAir customer review
SIN-KUL economy (MI342) 13 May 2015. I took this flight as my previous flight into Singapore was delayed meaning that I missed my connection. The service is generally inferior to Singapore Airlines. The airplane is neat and tidy with reasonable comfortable seats (it was ok for a 45 minute flight). Food consisted in a small drink (orange juice) without even a glass; poorer than usual 3-4 stars European airlines. the flight was on time and cabin crew was generally pleasant. not particularly attentive though. A service comparable to a 3 star European carrier.

### SilkAir customer review
Singapore to Siem Reap in Economy. Decent A320 which was clean and comfortable. We did not eat the food as we ate at the airport before the flight but for a relatively short flight the food looked substantial-comings from Europe a shorthaul flight with 'proper' food is a rarity these days! Got to chose our seats beforehand online when booking so that was good-no extra charge for that or baggage. Recommend for a short haul trip-but in reality they are not that cheap-we could have gone Business Class on Vietnam Airlines for the same price but that would have meant a connection in Saigon which would be a pain - Silkair are I think the only direct service between Singapore and Siem Reap so I guess they price accordingly (don't blame them for that).

### SilkAir customer review
Makassar (UPG) to Singapore on 16 March 2015 flight MI-141 and return on 23 March 2015 MI-142. Good service departure on time 30 kg baggage allowance these I like. The only thing I don't like is the meal. If you don't like chicken expect to starve during the flight. The choices were Rice with Chicken or Pasta with Chicken. On the return flight the choices were Rice with Chicken or Egg with Chicken Sausage. Why not choice of Chicken or Beef/Fish?

### SilkAir customer review
This was my first experience flying Silk Air. I took two flights in March from Chiang Mai to Singapore and Singapore to Bali. Both flights on time and the crew where friendly and professional. No seat back ICE but you can log on to there system via a laptop smartphone for some entertainment. Appreciated the 30 kgs luggage allowance in economy and I was able to check in the day before at Changi airport which made luggage storage much easier. The only negative was the food which let down the rest of the flight. I would fly with them again.

### SilkAir customer review
Phuket - Singapore 7 February. A very comfortable flight. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The food was also very generous for such a short flight. The IFE was very limited but that didn't matter given how short the flight was.

Caught the 18.25 Siem Reap to Singapore (Flight 5023) on Tuesday 17 Feb 2015. We hoped to have a meal as expected on an evening flight but were very disappointed. We were about the last to be served and there was only a "very" spicy seafood dish left. (Not a very wise menu choice by the airline in the first place). We don't eat seafood let alone very spicy food anyway. The chicken dish had all gone and that was that. So we asked if there was any vegetarian left and although we had not pre-ordered this there was a chance we thought. But no nothing left! So we looked at the hostess and said anything else around? Only pot noodles. So she brought seaweed flavour pot noodles for our meal. Not very nice really! Then the dessert was poor also - 2 pieces of water melon and also 2 chunks of tinned pineapple. Very poor food indeed! Thank goodness our connecting flight back to the UK had good refreshments!

Coimbatore to Singapore trip. While waiting to board the flight which was supposed to depart at 23.25 hours Silkair announced that the departure was delayed. An hour later they said the flight was delayed by 14+ hours and would take of next day at 14.00. Then came so much of confusion. We had already completed immigration and now Silkair had to work with Indian Immigration Customs and Airport Security to clear us to leave the airport. Silkair asked us to go to International Arrivals and on the way we were stopped by Security who refused to allow this. For the next hour there were arguments between Silkair Security and Immigration. We were stuck in no-man's land inside the airport and there was no air-conditioning in that area. Nobody had any idea on how to handle the situation. An Immigration officer told me that local representatives of Silkair in Coimbatore do not have cordial working relationship with the authorities like Immigration and Airport Security and so no one wants to co-operate with Silkair. After nearly an hour we were allowed to leave the airport. The flight left next day at 15.00 hours a delay of 15.5 hours. Silkair could not arrange for meals and so gave only biscuits during the 4 hour flight. Upon landing at Changi Airport baggage belt was changed 4 times leading to passenger running from one belt to another causing more frustration. I regret travelling by Silkair.

PEN-SIN SIN-PEN. Flights departed on time. First leg plane appeared new and we were served a hot snack. Return flight not quite as good. Left on time but seats were dirty and stained. Cabin crew excellent and friendly. The plane appeared to be new but the seat covers were stained and looked filthy dirty. I mentioned to the purser as we left the plane she said she would put it on the flight report. Apart from this an enjoyable flight yet again with Silk Air.

Bangalore to Singapore and back. The plane was old and the seats were dirty. The tray tables were filthy. On the way from Bangalore to Singapore the toilets were disgusting. The food was bad pretty much the worst I have experienced on an airline. There was no proper inflight entertainment worth speaking of (silent movies shouldn't really count) they showed the same three (silent no headphones) short movies/game shows on the flight to and from Singapore. The staff did the bare minimum but the landing cards were given at the very last minute (when flying to Singapore) and not at all on the return journey (they claimed the forms had changed but that is not true at all). The bassinet seat could not be mounted (out of order) on the way back. It was just one of the worst experiences I have had traveling economy and one I did not expect from an airline associated with Singapore airlines.

### SilkAir customer review
PEN from SIN as a codeshare with Singapore Airlines using an A320-200. I haven't much to say for the first leg as I slept throughout the whole flight but the boarding process was nice with welcoming flight attendants. They did offer me lunch but I refused because I opted to sleep some more. What disappoints me is that I thought I booked for a window seat but when I came onboard there was no window at all (probably to reduce the engine noise that enters the cabin). On my trip back from PEN to SIN (which will then proceed to CGK with Singapore Airlines) I had to put my sporting equipment on the oversize baggage section which wasn't really a bother for me. Decent food for a short haul trip on the way back. Not bad for a regional airline all in all.

SIN-CEB 18/06/14 CEB-SIN 10/07/2014 both flights new Boeing 737-800s. These were my fourth flights on SilkAir in the past 12 months and as usual there was little to complain about. The cabin crew were friendly responsive to needs and requests. Food and drinks service was efficient the food very good. I find the legroom and seats on the 737s to be a little poorer than on the slightly bigger A320s that little extra space on the A320 makes a difference to the larger traveller like me. There is no seat back IFE although this is improved if you use your own device to access the inflight wi-fi service. There is some IFE on the drop down monitors mostly silent films which I enjoy but most would not no headsets are provided.

### SilkAir customer review
SIN-SUB and SUB-SIn on A319-100 and A320-200. Old aircraft but good service. Seat comfortable with more legroom than budget airline. Cabin service was smiley and efficient. The meal was nice. IFE was very limited just a rather farcical comedy show but we can still use the newly SilkAir Studio. Overall this is a pleasant flight with courteous service.

### SilkAir customer review
Simply atrocious lack of service and responsiveness. On Friday 5th Sep I was in Hangzhou expecting to catch the 16.20 flight to Singapore allowing a 25 hour connection window to an SQ flight. At 10.30 am got an SMS advising a 2.10 delay so I'll miss the connection. I called my travel agent in Australia and asked him to find an alternative. I was quite willing to drive to Shanghai and change onto SQ 17.00 flight - it had seats. I was given the complete run around by Silk Air directed to three different phone numbers with no one willing to act. Next I got my secretary in Hangzhou to try she got the exact same outcome. After about 6 calls over 3 hours time had run out. I took the original flight and missed the connection. At Singapore at midnight SQ gave me a hotel voucher for the Conrad and told me to take a taxi. The taxi queue was at least an hour long. I would have had a couple of hours sleep before needing to get up and return. At the SQ desk I swapped this for a much more logical bed in the "pay by the hour" mini hotel in T3. Why wasn't this offered in the first place? Why do I have to ask? Silk Air A320? I had a seat in 2nd row avoiding the 1st row - that has too little leg room. There is in no power point despite being a 5 hour flight so my PC battery ran out. No in-seat video so no alternative entertainment.

### SilkAir customer review
Silk Air MI 411 KTM to SIN Aug 27th - Business Class. Flight departed about 45 min late due to late arrival of the aircraft and air traffic control delays. Business class seats are quite spacious and comfortable for a single aisle aircraft. The service was impeccable and the food delicious. I really like the WiFi video streaming service so you can watch movies on your laptop or tablet. The movies could be more current but that's a small matter. My only disappointment is that there are no power outlets in business class. Otherwise I give Silk Air a big thumbs up.

### SilkAir customer review
Terrible experience with Silk air from Singapore to Wuhan return. First of all I had pre-booked my Vegetarian meal but I was served non-vegetarian. It is not worth the money they charge. They don't give headphones no TV. The air hostess didn't serve me drinks Would never take Silkair again on any route.

### SilkAir customer review
Singapore - Manado return. Very nice C class product for a 3.5h flight. Flight on time decent seat pitch good food and efficient and friendly cabin staff. The only negative aspect of the journey was the terrible business class lounge in Manado.

### SilkAir customer review
I travelled from Brunei to Hyderabad via Singapore using Airlines website. Brunei to Singapore was by Singapore airlines where it was a bigger aircraft with good leg room. Singapore to Hyderabad was by Silkair smaller aircraft little leg space bottom line it's Cattle Class. The fare paid is Singapore Airlines service is budget. For certain cities SQ uses Silkair but the fare is SQ. If this continues SQ will see customers choosing budget airlines.

### SilkAir customer review
Took MI for my flight from SIN to Phuket and I must say service standards were far better as compared to Singapore Airlines (the latter service standard dropped drastically over the years). It was a short flight and I wasn't expecting to be full service which includes meal and refreshments. Inflight entertainment is lacking but I am not concerned about it since the flight was short. The airline could do better by providing ear phones for those who didn't want to watch silent movies on board.

### SilkAir customer review
Danang - Singapore business class. A bit late but nothing too serious. Ipad equivalent handed out but no headphones. On enquiry told "out of stock" just this flight I enquire no all flights no headphones. So what is the point of a movie let alone music without headphones? You can get them on cheap airlines for $2 or any cheap store so why? Is the Singapore airline group taking their reputation and customer loyalty for granted? The meal I had was ok but my wife had a chicken dish that was terrible and I notice other passengers with the same dish largely left it. On arrival in Singapore no one to drive the air-bridge. At the price these guys charge compared to say Vietnam Air on the same route with similar equipment meals and service oh and headphones I know which one I will be on next trip.

### SilkAir customer review
That's how to do it. I just flew two short sectors SIN-PEN and PEN-SIN. I had something to eat and drink in 20 minutes. I flew on the same trip on EK and the same took 3 hours.

### SilkAir customer review
SIN-BDO on A319-100. Old aircraft but superb service. Identifiable that SilkAir is a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines. Although a bit overpriced SilkAir offers good connection at Changi decent meal options and IFE through overhead screen installed on the aircraft.

### SilkAir customer review
Singapore to Yogyakarta via Silkair return 20-24 Jun 14. Both flights quite full seat comfortable with more legroom than budget airline. Long queue at Yogyakarta airport Check-in. We received complimentary bottle of mineral water from the Silkair ground service manager. Cabin service was smiley and efficient. Meals edible but very small portions compared to SIA portion.

### SilkAir customer review
Singapore to Yogyakarta and Singapore to Kalibo return. Both flights on A320. Flight Yogyakarta was delayed on landing due to congestion in the airport-not really the airline's fault. Served hotcakes for breakfast which was nice. Flight back to Singapore was delayed because of the late arrival in Yogyakarta (again airport congestion) but cabin crew were very nice and professional with a semi-full load. Business class line in Yogyakarta was also used for economy which meant long wait for all passengers. Flight to Kalibo took off on time. Full load but cabin crew were warm and friendly. Flight back to Singapore was delayed because of delayed arrival of aircraft from Cebu. Meal was delicious and again friendly cabin crew. Check in was chaotic because of the small airport size with 4 international flights checking in at the same time and the different queues intersecting each other. However Silkair was the only one with clear and audible announcements in the airport and the staff tried their best in the chaotic check-in even though the space constraints limited what they could do.

### SilkAir customer review
Flew with SilkAir recently from SG to Penang on 7 June and back on 9 June. It was my first time flying with them and I was very disappointed. Really bad experience. Firstly the flight on the 7th was delayed for an hour and no announcements were being made leaving me and my family very puzzled. Next there was a lack in variety for the in-flight meals. The chicken pie served on the return flight was terrible as there was a burnt taste. Drinks wise they only serve water orange juice and tea. The last point was on the flight attendants. As the regional wing of Singapore Airlines I was utterly surprised at their dressing. They looked so sloppy in their uniforms with unkempt hair. However they still portrayed excellent service qualities such as being polite and attentive to address customers' needs.

### SilkAir customer review
SIN-REP return. Enjoyed my flight with Silkair to Siem Reap a couple of weeks ago. Cabin Crew were very friendly and cheerful. On both legs they seemed a lot more engaging than your usual cabin crew on other airlines. Breakfast onboard was pretty good with rounds of coffee and water following. Shame that the wireless streaming IFE had not already been implemented. Departure and arrival were both a little late but not a big deal. Disembarkation at Siem Reap via stairs which for some strange reason I really like. Bags were out fast.

### SilkAir customer review
Travelled SIN-HKT-SIN on 28/31 March. Both flights boarded quickly and departed/arrived on time. Service is good with fair enough seat pitch for a regional airlines. Food was the usual airlines fare with a main fruits and drinks. For the price though there is nothing to complain about. Plane was clean and I got to try their new 737 SIN-HKT.

### SilkAir customer review
MI 654 on SIN to HAN on March 11th. Pros: flight was on time food was okay. Service was good. Some choice of magazines. Cons: no personal in-flight entertainment only on overhead monitor w/o tune. I use my own airline headphones but tune was off so we could not hear anything. SilkAir as daughter company to Singapore Airlines but cant earn mileage for Star Alliance.

### SilkAir customer review
Economy class from Singapore to Surabaya on Feb 28. Silk Air operates A319 on this sector. We got a front row seats as we traveled with one child and one infant. The flight attendants were very helpful and friendly. One of them even helped us by carrying our two hand luggage and stored them in the overhead compartment. During the meal time my wife decided to skip the meal service but a purser approached her and offered some bread - she had our daughter on her lap. I would say Silk Air in-flight services were better than SQ.

SIN - Koh Samui - SIN. The crew on the flight to KS were very slow and we still didn't have our food by the time the captain said that we were starting our descent. Flight back the crew were very efficient and food was tasty.

### SilkAir customer review
Flights from Singapore to Penang on 16th February return sector to Changhi on 26th February. Smooth flights both ways with attentive cabin crew and informative flight crew. For such a short flight approximately an hour each way drink and sandwich served. Only criticism was the lack of sandwich choice tuna on first leg sardines on the return. An alternative would have scored maximum choice. Flights all on time.

### SilkAir customer review
SIN-SBY-SIN on 30 January and 1 February. The SIN-SBY leg was okay - cabin crew forgot about my son when distributing children meals and only remembered when they saw him at the general meal service. One stewardess blurted out that they missed out a child another hushed her though I had already heard it. The service on the return leg was much better. Food was good though the portion size was rather small even for my 8-year-old. Seat pitch is comfortable with reasonable leg space. Would have rated them better if not for the lapse in service on the outbound flight.

### SilkAir customer review
SIN-DVO-SIN. This is a gem of an airline I have used this service to Davao on many occasions and always been extremely impressed with the staff food and aircraft comfort. When you consider that this is the only direct service into Davao from outside the Philippines it represents great value for money when compared to having to transit either Manila or Cebu.

### SilkAir customer review
SIN-KCH. The plane was a full one but the SilkAir crew handled the crowd professionally. The four lovely air stewardesses greeted and smiled all the time which resonates with the company's latest campaign "Feeling Home Onboard". The only downsides are: The crew should speak better English and when the leading air stewardess made any announcement she should needed to be a little louder. Other than that a simple pleasant short flight which I enjoyed.

### SilkAir customer review
I flew SIN-CJB-SIN in Economy Class on November 17th and 29th. I have flown on this route twice before (in 2009 and 2011) but the flights had since been retimed to be more convenient. Both flights were close to 100% full. The aircraft were two very new A320-233s (9V-SLR and -SLQ respectively) and each flight took just over four hours. The Economy Class seats were fairly comfortable with adequate lumbar support and average pitch and legroom. Seat recline was limited though. One of my biggest gripes about flying with SilkAir is the lack of in-seat screens which many other airlines in the region and worldwide have fitted in their narrowbody Economy Class cabins. In- flight entertainment was the Silkwinds magazine (a fairly interesting read) and overhead screens showing silent films which in my opinion is insufficient for any flight of over two hours in duration. Drinks and a packet of nuts were offered a few times during the ascent cruise and descent and at mealtimes. The meals (lacto-ovo vegetarian in my case) were satisfactory though not as good both in terms of quality and quantity as the meals served onboard parent company Singapore Airlines' shorter flights. It is worth noting however that all service was conducted very courteously and to very high standards. Also worth noting is SilkAir's new 30 kg checked baggage allowance which I found very useful. All in all for the price paid (S$641.80 round-trip per adult) SilkAir offered fair value for money - though I hope to see an improved onboard product with the arrival of the airline's first B737-800s next year.

### SilkAir customer review
Flew SilkAir from Singapore to Kathmandu and back. It was an A320 with very generous legroom in its economy class. The service was solid the meals were OK (although the meal out of Kathmandu was less good than the one out of Singapore) and although there is no in-seat IFE system time flew by quite quickly. Nothing extraordinary but good enough!

I was travelling from Singapore to Manado 30 April and 21 June. It was amore than 3 hour flight. It departed from Changi at 9am. Everything was fine except the in-flight entertainment was quite boring. This made the trip seem longer and boring. Wish there was a movie. If this was an evening flight passengers would be resting or sleeping.

### SilkAir customer review
Have flown with Silk Air many times on the SIN-PNH route but have not wrote a review before. The service has always been good and plenty of leg room. The food and drinks are just right for this short 1hr 45min flight. The return to SIN this time was hampered by bad weather and we were delayed 15min landing but the pilot managed to keep clear of the worst and kept us informed. There is no in flight entertainment as such but I'm aware of this and have my ipod and book. Will fly Silk Air again.

### SilkAir customer review
Return flights from SIN to Penang in early September travelling as a couple with two kids under 2. Just like it's big brother SQ Silkair maintained it's excellent approach to customer service. Attendants were patient and accommodating in helping with our two little ones offering toys and baby food as well as blocking a seat next to us. On the return flight I left a carry on bag on board and didn't realise until we had reached LHR! By the time I was able to access email there was already a message from the airline saying they had the bag at Changi and asked how they could get it back to me. I asked if it could be forwarded to Munich the next step on our itinerary and they have arranged it. Outstanding.

SIN-SUB in Economy Class. Flight delayed by 15 minutes and the pilot made an apology to all passengers. The in- flight service was better than SIA. FA were friendlier and attentive. Food was tasty but there are no PTV. Overall it was a pleasant trip with Silk Air.

### SilkAir customer review
Thu 25 July 2013 I flew (MI 221) from Surabay to Singapore. During the meal service it was surprising that they just passed me by without offering anything. All passengers in front behind and next to me got offered the meal. They were 2 trolleys with 4 stewardess. When they passed me by I called one of them and asked if I could talk to their supervisor and again surprisingly they still did not notice that I haven't been served.

### SilkAir customer review
SIN-CEB return flight on SilkAir flight was punctual. Seating was good but food service was somewhat disappointing. Entertainment is provided on shared drop down screens but no sound! You watch programming in silence. Silkair is claiming to be best regional airline but service provided is only on par with other budget carriers such as Cebu Pacific. Cost of flights are vastly greater than the other low cost carriers who offer comparable service and only becomes a viable choice when used as an add on flight to Singapore Airways flights.

### SilkAir customer review
Singapore-Chiang Mai-Singapore as part of a Singapore Airlines codeshare ticket. Flight to Chiang Mai was a little late departing but flight back to Singapore departed on time. Both aircraft very clean and well presented. Cabin crew were very friendly and responsive to any request. Legroom quite acceptable for a regional airline. Food was also very nice and actually more than we had expected. If these two flights were typical of Silkair we would be very happy to fly them again anytime.

Flight 488 from Singapore to Kolkata. Flight was a night flight and was very comfortable. It was very easy to fall asleep since the seats were comfortable as well. The food served was satisfactory. There was a shared entertainment system showing some TV shows. Flight did not have a personal entertainment system but I like the atmosphere without a personal TV. Flight was very comfortable and I would fly with them again.

Flew Singapore to Phuket as part of my Singapore airlines flight. Aircraft was an A320 very comfortable. We had a spare seat next to us as the flight wasn't very full. Flight time was just over an hour had a full meal which was one of the best airline meals I have had. Spicy chicken and fried noodles! Overhead monitors but didn't watch as I had my iPad! Beautiful approach into Phuket flying over Phang Bay! Rate the airline highly and is a true image of its parent company Singapore Airlines.

Flew from Singapore to Coimbatore (29/5/13) in business class. Though we were the first ones to clear immigration our luggage arrived last with the priority tags intact! It looked like no one had any idea what was happening with all the business class luggage! After I complained repeatedly I was told that the luggage was there but the loaders for some reason were not loading the priority luggage. Why did we pay business class fare if we had to wait for our luggage until the end?

### SilkAir customer review
I flew Silk Air for the first time on a recent holiday in April USM-SIN and was very pleased. The flight departed and arrived on time meals and drinks were served on this short 1h30 flight and were good. Inflight entertainment was silent video and amusing staff were helpfull and polite. The one bonus to the whole experience was the S$40 Changi Airport stopover vouchers we both received as part of a promotion they had. I would recomend Silk Air and would fly them again.

### SilkAir customer review
SIN-PEN on A320. Did online check-in and selected my preferred seat but only learned from the check-in counter staff that my seat got changed because 'Silkair changed the aircraft type'. All I know is Silkair only flies on A310/320 since when it has different aircraft type other than the single aisle aircraft? Anyway I was in a hurry never argue with the staff. On time departure no IFE as expected. Basic snack with only coffee tea or orange juice OK for 1 hr 10 mins flight. Overall the service was as good as budget airline (TR and AK) with extra legroom.

### SilkAir customer review
Kathmandu to Singapore I felt harassed in the check-in counter. They weighed my cabin bag twice. Staff at KTM airport are rude and not trained to deal with customers. In-flight service was not bad not enough staff to serve. Food quality is poor. Need to improve overall.

### SilkAir customer review
SIN-HKT. The service was adequate. The cabin crew were young and had a poor level of English. We were served a hot dish and there were TV screens. This is above European flights handled by European carriers for a similar duration (90 mins). The seats were more comfortable than on some European carriers' long hauls.

Return trip from Singapore to Kolkata (India). Silent (no audio) entertainment system narrow seats food was not good missed luggage (though I had about 15 hrs layover/connecting time at Changi). Chaotic customer service at Kolkata regarding missed luggage. I would not recommend SilkAir to anyone!

### SilkAir customer review
Flew Silk Air on the return trip from CCU-SIN. It was cheaper by 150 SGD compared to Singapore Airlines. For 150$ less there was no personal inflight entertainment. I guess for a night flight of 4 hours if you plan to sleep it is $150 worth saving. Return flight during the winter in the northern hemisphere is moved forward by an hour which meant it reached Singapore at 4.30 am which was too early. During summer it arrives at 5.30 am and I can catch a taxi at 6am without paying taxi surcharge. I have no major complaints and would recommend Silk Air as long as it is cheaper than Singapore Airlines.

### SilkAir customer review
Flight from Coimbatore to Singapore. While inflight service is fair ground staff were rude and arrogant. Staff at check-in counter refused to allow my laptop bag since I already had a handbag. Then the manager/supervisor came and I explained to him and then they allowed it after weighing and checking my laptop bag. They refused to allow not even a kilo above the baggage allowance for other passengers and I observed the passengers discarding luggage content to reduce the weight. In my many years of travelling I have not see such rude staff.

### SilkAir customer review
SIN-KCH. Pleasant short one hour plus flight. Cabin crew were very friendly and the pilot was a little humorous which brightened up the day and ease the atmosphere. I mean I agree that we all want our flights and journey to be as fun comfortable as possible. Little gestures from the entire team in collaboration with SilkAir's newly-launched campaign make me look forward to my next trip with SilkAir!

### SilkAir customer review
We flew as a family of 5 from SIN-HKT-SIN. All flights left on time. Actually quite impressed with the level of service offered and the professionalism of the crew. The meal/snack was of a great quality. The planes were new looking and seats were more than adequate remembering I am 6ft3 and 120kg I felt easily accommodated. Check in process quick and easy however was surprised that the check in at HKT only opened 1hr 50min before the flight departure time - I do not think this is normal maybe a staffing issue that day. I can easily recommend Silkair.

### SilkAir customer review
Flew Singapore-Davao-Singapore with return leg via Cebu. Check-in was quick both in Singapore and Davao flights on time and service was great with Captain informing passengers of flight path. Entertainment ok for a short flight but can be better. Food was excellent to Davao but tasteless going back to Singapore. SilkAir should improve managing their lines for transiting passengers in Cebu as travellers were cutting in the lines to the boarding lounge and the airline should put up signs for transiting passengers as some followed those disembarking in Cebu. Cosy and warm atmosphere despite being a full flight. Will fly SilkAir again.

REP-DAD. Short flight on lovely and clean A320. No food served but given extra orange juice when requested. Service was fantastic. My mother had a broken collar bone and was offered an extra pillow on three separate occasions! Would highly recommend even though flight was late taking off.

### SilkAir customer review
Booked over 6 months in advance for our tickets from Singapore to Koh Samui. This was the first flight with Silk Air and possibly the last. Food was very ordinary on the flight to Samui. We didn't eat it. Flight was okay apart from that but return flight was very poor. Despite booking together and being husband and wife we were placed in separate seats to make matters worse at the rear near the toilets. Admittedly it was a busy flight but the staff didn't seem to care. It's only a 1.5 hour flight' was the response when I asked if we could move to seats together. The food was better than on the way over but we felt like we were travelling with a very average budget airline even though we paid a premium price. Will avoid travelling with Silk Air again.

### SilkAir customer review
My husband and I flew from Penang to Singapore at 9.15pm on Fri 16th Nov and requested a window seat and the one next to it and the same for our flight SQ237 from Singapore to MEL at 11.50pm. We were told there were no window seats plus the next one available. We were lied to as there were seats available when we got onboard. Our first experience with SilkAir has left us extremely disappointed.

### SilkAir customer review
My most recent flight from KCH-SIN was very disappointing. I was seated at the second last row and one passenger assigned on the last row could not take her seat because it was wet. Flight was very full but luckily the flight attendants managed to find another seat for her but this had left the passenger and those around with a bad impression. Food was really bad (just a small curry puff) and limited choice of drinks. Additionally being seated on the second last row the thing I felt would have irritated many passengers was seeing flight attendants constantly opening the overhead compartment just to keep getting their handbags.

Singapore to Kochi on airbus 320. I had transferred from an 18 and a half hour flight from JFK to Frankfurt to Singapore on Singapore Airlines. The Cabin Crew and the Flight Attendants did a very good job in getting us a bassinet seat for our one year old daughter. The food was great the seats were OK and the entertainment/shows were just reruns because of the flip down screens every 3 seats behind. The safety video was done professionally well and the Flight Attendants and the Cabin Crew did a very professional job in helping other passengers out. Would fly with them again.

SIN-CEB on A320. Transfered from a 22-hour flight (JFK-FRA-SIN) with SQ to MI. Boarding was probably one of the most organized affairs I've dealt with. Flight attendants were efficient and friendly. Cabin was still the old-style with the blue seats. However they were very comfortable with proper lumbar support and legroom I felt was more than SQ's A380 in Y. The lack of personal IFE didn't bother me as it was only a 3.5-hour flight. There were screens on the over head that played various TV shows. Although they didn't have any headphones nor the seats had any ability to be plugged in with. Food was delicious and FAs were marching down the aisles with drinks every 10 minutes or so and it was only a 3 hour flight! Overall I would say it was a perfect experience on a regional carrier and I wish that US airlines would follow MI but I think we all know that won't happen.

MI 487/488 Calcutta to Singapore and return on 12 and 16 July 2012. First time on Silk Air i was impressed by the service especially that of the cabin crew. The row just behind me were drunk and demanding - asking for food and alcoholic beverages multiple times. They smilingly obliged to each of their demands. Food was good and sufficient with 2 rounds of drinks on both flights. Pilots gave information about the flight status and route three times during the flights. No personal entertainment system but reruns of bloopers wash out etc. Would fly again.

SIN-HKT-SIN. Both flights were serviced by a A320. The interior on both planes were old and scuffed. The seats were ok but not overly comfortable. Cabin temperature on the outbound flight was too cold. There was no personal inflight entertainment system though an overhead entertainment system played the same episode of the same show on both flights. Complimentary meals and drinks provided on both flights though the quality of the food and range was slightly worse than that on Singapore Airlines. Even though my return flight was a morning flight Silk Air decided to serve a curry where a breakfast meal would have been more appropriate. Outbound flight was full of Australians yelling at the top of their voices and walking to the front of the plane in an attempt to be the first to order a "cold one". The crew worked well under these difficult conditions. The service is very good. Nevertheless the flight attendants remained composed managed disrespectful passengers well and always kept a smile on their face.

Got a flight from Siem Reap to Katmandu in one booking although there was an 18 hour transit in Singapore they did not provide hotel nor informed us about the situation so we could plan and book accommodation earlier. All transit hotels were full so we had to stay in nap areas of the airport all night. Never again flying with Silk.

PEN-SIN in Business Class. Check-in quick and due to lack of lounge you get a voucher which can be used in Coffee Bean and McDonalds. Boarding on time and staff very friendly and pleasant addressed all Business Class passengers by name. Meal served was very nice and tea offered afterwards. Arrival on time but priority baggage did not arrive first which was disappointing.

SIN-CJB-SIN on A319. Aircraft full but in good condition. Outbound to CJB - a delay of 45 mins but return on time. IFE was virtually non existent; only a few silent features played over and over on drop-down screens. The meal was the same both ways edible on the way in served at cabin temperature on the return to SIN. Crew very professional and pleasant. In short a fairly good flight but for the amount we paid for the tickets ($800+ per person) SilkAir did not offer good value for money.

SIN-HKT-SIN. Short flight to Phuket and back. Full service where crew begins with an offering of two kinds of newspapers! No IFE but hardly matters. Meals offered with a choice of meats. Drinks offered twice during the flight. Great seats with ample leg room. All in all a very good regional product offering great value for money.

SUB-SIN. On time. Choices of meal was rice with beef or noodles with chicken. For both choices there was an additional small cake and a cup of sealed water. Furthermore you had own choice of whatever you wanted to drink. A320 used on this flight is much better than the A319. You have a full day in Surabaya then board and arrive in Changi 2 hours before many of the European flights leave. That leaves you enough time to enjoy Changi airport at bit with no rush to catch your plane.

### SilkAir customer review
SIN-SUB. Departed 10 minutes early. A319 is starting to get a bit old. Seats look very used. Food was good but not excellent. I would recommend since this fits perfectly with the European flight arriving in the morning in Singapore so you have around 2 hours layover in Changi before landing at 9.10am local Surabaya time.

SIN-CNX. Efficient service. It was only a 3hr flight so only one meal (which wasn't great) but we were given plenty of water and juice. Plane was an A320 so small seats not too much bother on short flights though. Good overall service friendly and helpful staff. Not much of inflight entertainment though and no headphones to watch one of the screens.

### SilkAir customer review
SIN-DAD on Airbus A320. Plane departed and arrived on time. Service onboard excellent directly after take off drinks were served and crew made several rounds during the flight. Food a big disappointment - a tasteless chicken curry and no salt and pepper in the cutlery bag. In terms of seating just like any other standard airline. Price was low and got me to my destination safely so will use them again.

Singapore to Kathmandu return. Seats reasonably comfortable. Service and food were good. Return flight was much better although was late leaving making it a rush to connect to our flight from Changi. Overall a good experience.

### SilkAir customer review
Chennai-Singapore Business Class A319. Despite the small aircraft operating this route the business class cabin was comfortable and the service was excellent. The flight leaves at a great time and I prefer this to the usual midnight flights. Food was more to the Asian palate and spicy but good. Would like to see a better quality Western option. Excellent inflight drinks and snacks and great service.

### SilkAir customer review
Surprised at the comfort of the plane and professional staff. On such a short flight Singapore-KL I wasn't expecting much however the cabin was clean new and nicely fitted out. Leg room was fine and staff were attentive. I was happy to be flying a 737 rather than something smaller.

### SilkAir customer review
Cabin crew were helpful and friendly. Offered drinks constantly and gave my 6 year old games to keep her entertained. We were 4 passengers from Singapore to Lombok and were all happy with their services.

### SilkAir customer review
Singapore-Kochi on A320. Cabin crew professional seating comfortable. Cabin was clean and well maintained. No shortage of pillows and blankets making for a pleasant 4 hr night flight. Luggage delivered promptly at Kochi.

### SilkAir customer review
AMI-SIN. Very impressed by this short haul flight. Very food crew. Staff were efficient from check-in at the smallish Lombok airport and throughout the flight. Plane was A320 clean and airy. Very good fish for dinner. Arrival in SIN 30 mins before scheduled time.

### SilkAir customer review
KCH-SIN A short and pleasant flight. Despite the crowded plane the cabin crew is still warm and friendly. SilkAir has finally launched new menus which makes frequent traveler more appertising. The ground staff is friendly and extends warm welcome to everyone. Also SilkAir has also introduced the new autumn theme seating. Simple soothing yet truly makes passengers feel exclusive. SilkAir also departs and arrives on time.

Chiang-Mai to Singapore flight was on time cabin crew were nice and friendly. Plane was in good condition food average inflight entertainment was good. Overall a good short flight.

### SilkAir customer review
SIN-MES-SIN. Excellent service both ways. Staff courteous and efficient - surprised to be addressed by name by cabin crew. Never got this treatment from the crew on my SQ SIN-CGK-SIN flight the following day.

### SilkAir customer review
SIN-PEN-SIN chose Silkair because it offered good departure and arrival times for a weekend trip. Legroom was okay and departure / arrival via Changi Terminal 2 is better than via the Budget Terminal. However there was no inflight entertainment snacks were of poor quality and the aircraft wasn't looking too new either. On this 1 hour 20 minute flight if you're not a connecting passenger from an SQ flight there isn't really that much to differentiate Silkair from the other airlines that fly this route such as MH AK 3K and TR.

### SilkAir customer review
SNE-HKT return. Outbound flight left 20 minutes late very full plane. I was carrying a large garment bag containing my wedding dress and crew happily hung it in wardrobe for me. Decent refreshment served even though only a 1 hr 20 minute flight special meal and my partner normal meal and both were quite good. Seats ok - cabin is 3x3 config. Cabin looking a little old and tired but fine for a regional flight. Only inflight entertainment is on overhead screens. Newspapers supplied on inbound flight again another refreshment which was fine. Both directions the cabin was very hot and stuffy which got a bit uncomfy. Crew efficient and fine to deal with.

### SilkAir customer review
Kuching-Singapore returng. The ground staff in Kuching and in Singapore are friendly and helpful. Cabin crew friendly and shows great hospitality. The only thing I would like to comment is that SilkAir should make new safety videos and also provide different kind of inflight meals. In general it is an airline worth recommending to everyone!

### SilkAir customer review
A320 economy service SIN-LGK was very satisfactory. Both legs on time check in completed expeditiously seat pitch better than SIA A380 economy. In flight food adequate for 90 min short haul flight served by well turned out and attentive cabin staff.

### SilkAir customer review
SIN-PEN. Excellent flight comfortable seats on A320. Friendly and efficient cabin crew. Hot snack and drink provided on this short flight.

### SilkAir customer review
Singapore-Phuket on A320. Seat fine and clean. Cabin staff very friendly and professional. Special Meal was served as requested drinks very good and served twice. Overall very satisfied with everything and will choose them again as first airline option. Baggage was very fast on belt at Phuket.

Singapore-Da Nang via Siem Reap. Passengers from Siem Reap to Singapore join on outbound journey and stay on board at Da Nang for direct flight to Singapore. Silkair okay for a regional short haul airline. Business class resembles premium economy which is okay in a flight lasting only just over 3 hours same for food. Wine served from small 2 glass bottles which are on most airlines dished out to passengers rather than eked out. Cabin crew charming and thoughtful - a colleague who is a vegetarian hadn't ordered veggie food but stewardess offered him economy fish meal as alternative and promised to put in a request for veggie meal on his return to Singapore. Da Nang airport has no provision for business class lounge whereas at Changi T2 the Silkair lounge is a shared one - not a terrific place to spend 6 hours in transit. Silkair office in Da Nang very uncooperative not to say obstructive requiring direct communication with Singapore HQ which resulted in action.

### SilkAir customer review
Coimbatore-Singapore in Business Class. A nice flight partly I suspect because I happened to be the only passenger in the small business class cabin on the A319. As the flight departed at 1245am it was good to get the supper meal served and out of the way so to get some sleep. I would rate Silk Air Business Class equivalent to a good premium economy but still quite satisfying. The wine was good FAs were charming. While check-in was handled professionally boarding was chaotic at Coimbatore maybe as there do not appear to be many international flights in and out of this small airport and associated terminal suggesting need for more practice in dealing with such flights.

### SilkAir customer review
SIN-REP return both legs with stop in Danang makes journey longer and less convenient. IFE not impressive enough only small screens every 4 rows and I spent my time reading instead. Food and beverages are average. Since I got promo fare it is a good deal compared to JetStar.
