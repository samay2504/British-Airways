### "never received such poor service"
This is mainly regarding the level of customer disservice. After my 2 days worth of phone calls and initial lack of communication and then false information, I will never fly Fiji airways again. $1100 fare difference in price I needed to pay, when a preferable route I priced with flight centre was approximately the same price On checking the route that Fiji Airways re booked Brisbane-Nadi Nadi-LA LA-Calgary I was assured my luggage would be checked right through to Calgary. This is not the case and I will now need to collect luggage and recheck it in LA. One staff member was particularly unhelpful and deliberately misleading when i asked to speak to a supervisor to provide feedback she put me on hold 3 times and then hung up. I received an email saying my flight was confirmed and i was eligible to upgrade I called to confirm this and was told this was incorrect and no flight was booked and the price would be $2900. He found an alternatively flight the one listed above and said he would hold it until I called and paid. When I called to pay no such flight was recorded. I regularly travel both domestically and international and have never received such poor service.

### "no compensation offered"
Not Verified |  Change dates of flights with no compensation offered. Change paid for seats with no compensation offered. Do not get our special meal. A $30 voucher offered to the food court with no gluten free. The seats are angle beds and are rubbish.

### "attentiveness and kindness of the crew"
Returning from my honeymoon to Mexico, we flew via Qantas business on the way there and now our return trip is with Fiji Airways. We have just finished the first leg and I’m writing this while enjoying the Nadi business class lounge. The flight was amazing. I had my reservations because I’m aware Fiji airways doesn’t provide pyjamas and their menu and offerings are a little more restrictive than that of Qantas, but I felt compelled to write a review because of just how great Fiji Airways were. The cabin crew were the most attentive I have ever experienced and they memorize everyone’s names. Even when you’re not in your seat, walking to get a snack or to go to the bathroom they were calling me by name asking me how my flight is and if I want a snack. Comparatively, on my Qantas business class flight, the cabin crew don’t speak to you unless they have to. The seats were comfortable and felt nice and private. When I went to make my bed, crew ran to me to do it for me. The pillow is nice and full, they give you a mattress cover for your seat and a nice full doona as well as a blanket. They served Mumm on board as the champagne which is a personal fav so that gets extra marks. The food was not as good as Qantas. But it was not bad. I enjoyed the pumpkin and ginger soup a lot. Was probably the highlight of the meal. As my main I opted for the Fijian bbq chicken. The potato rostis were a little mealie, the chicken was flavorful although a little tough. The passionfruit mousse was alright but nothing to ring home about. The fruit plate had a nice selection of grapes, blackberries, raspberries, pineapple, rockmelon and honeydew. I also opted for the standard brekky which consisted of an omelette, tomato, a chicken sausage. I’m not a breakfast person but it was ok. Another comparison to Qantas - no barista style coffee on board. So I had to settle for an American style coffee which I’m not a big fan of. The entertainment system is really functional but needs a bigger selection of new movies. Wasn’t a whole lot on there that I was too keen to watch, but I made do. Overall, the flight was really comfortable and I would definitely fly and recommend Fiji Airways. The attentiveness and kindness of the crew really made the flight.

### “flight was terrible”
Not Verified | Nadi to Nausori. Fiji Airways flight was terrible. They boarded all passengers and for 15 minutes in summer heat, the air conditioning was not on and the excuse was "heavy tail wind" and can't take off. This could have become a serious health hazard for some passengers. Besides this, it took a while for an air host to provide water to all passengers. Fiji Airways is so bhikari that they can't give small bottles of Fiji water as they used to and now they are shamelessly giving apologies for reckless behaviour. One of the most expensive Airways in the world considering Nadi - Sydney and Nadi - Auckland flights.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. We paid 200+ USD to get seats, we are on honeymoon and still didn’t got seats together. Staff was rude, in whole flight we just asked for diet coke and we didn’t even got that. Fiji is beautiful place but this airline sucks. No idea what they will do on way back. Couldn’t connect to internet at all not for texting even. They did not even gave us forms to fill for tourist. We went to line and then immigration kick us out to get your forms.

### "I will never fly Fiji again"
I would avoid flying Fiji by any means possible. A quick summary of all the things that I’ve had go wrong for me: 1. Paid extra for a flexible flight and canceled it the same day. They would not give me a full refund even though it was within 24 hours. I asked for the partial refund anyway and it took them over 60 business days (read 3 months) to get it to me despite them saying that was the absolute longest it would take. Had to send them emails/call them multiple times to check in on it after the last date. I booked my flight and my girlfriend’s flight separately a few months in advance. We get email confirmations to check in for both of them day of. When we show up they say her flight has been canceled. No warning was given or any explanation for why. They were completely unable to help me at the desk. In a panic I had to try to book another seat on the flight since and their website kept giving me errors. I finally found a third party site that had a ticket listed and booked a new flight for $500 more than I originally paid. Now I expect to have to wait 3 months again to try and get a refund for the flight that was “canceled”. Throughout this their customer service was completely unable to help. I will never fly Fiji again and I recommend you try and book through Qantas or another airline if available.

### "Fiji Airways were excellent"
Unexpectedly Good! I wasn’t really sure what to expect, and feared a tricky experience but in fact Fiji Airways were excellent. I paid for extra legroom on the first leg but even on the long routing from Nadi to Vancouver the standard economy seat had excellent legroom. I’ve been more cramped in Qatar economy than this, especially their recent seat config. So this was a real bonus. Crew were good and friendly. I guess the weaker points are the food which is pretty basic and entertainment. Both flights were ahead of schedule. I’d definitely fly with them again.

### "never fly Fiji Airways again"
Not Verified | The alarm bells started when I was told the flight was fully booked and that I would need to put my hand luggage under the seat in front. After arguing with the check in person, I was told “Sorry, it’s company policy”. Upon boarding, people with huge suitcases as “hand luggage” took up all the storage space and I, with a medium sized back pack, was expected to sit for 13 hours with a bag between my legs. The journey was uncomfortable. The food on the plane was close to the worst I have ever had on any airline. I will never fly Fiji Airways again, no matter how cheap the flight.

### “They just felt money hungry”
What a horrible first impression of a country. Apparently Fiji Airways doesn't count a backpack as a "personal item" like every other airline on the face of the Earth, so be prepared to shell out $140 USD for the "privilege" of bring it on board. Their service is nothing special, and definitely doesn't make up for that outrageous charge. Will definitely never be flying them again. They just felt money hungry. Lots of other tropical islands you can visit and not get ripped off.

### "They served only one breakfast"
Not Verified |  It was five and half hours flight. They served only one breakfast. After that, they didn't offer anything unless we asked for a snack or drinks. They should have offered another light meal two hours after breakfast. Otherwise, everything is perfect.

### "Poor customer service"
Not Verified |  Poor customer service. I was told that my flight could potentially be refunded (without guarantees) in case I could prove that for immigration reasons I was not going to board that flight. Once I sent proof, I did not receive any refund nor a voucher. Loss of time (many calls and emails) and money. I will avoid flying with this company in the future.

### “they lied to our faces”
They charged us for overweight bags but they weren’t, we paid for seats but never got them! They lied to us at check-in about how many bags were allowed, the check in agents were the rudest people we’ve ever had to deal with, they lied to our faces and they power tripped on us! We wrote to customer service, I have emails confirming refunds but have never received a penny!! Do not trust this company! Do not fly with them! !

### "horrible when things do not go right"
Fiji Airways caveat emptor. Sorry this is Long: We took Fiji Airway Business class from LAX-NAN-KDV June 21st as a Tabau club member. We arrived at LAX at 2PM given the next connection would be tight and moved from the AA terminal to Bradley and found a seat, at 15:30 we get at text and email from Fiji Airways that out flight is delayed 18 hours (4PM Saturday). I immediately call the #800 and they are mostly clueless about the flight and are totally clueless when I ask about a hotel voucher. Basically, they tell me we are on our own which and the Contract of Carriage does not require them to pay even though it was their mechanically issue. We all know that this is a lie. I call, and get a hotel nearby and we head to the hotel. Once there I get notifications of our rebooking to KDV on Wednesday even though we arrive Sunday night late. I call Fiji Airways again and find that they are booked solid to KDV Monday and have no flights to KDV Tuesday. I asked about the hotel the night of the 21st in LAX and hotel in NAN Sunday-Wednesday. They tell me we are on our own again. I decided to book my own charter to the place we are going to 1.5-hour boat ride from KDV. Saturday 22nd arrive at the airport for check in and find out if we had stayed until at the airport until Friday at 18:30 (no 1 told us) we would have gotten hotel vouchers and $70s in meal per diem. WHAT! I write Fiji Airways and get no response and no response from manager at check-in. In flight service is really really good, comfortable beds just nice people and apologies given multiple times. Get to NAN and again, in Business Class and Tabau club member and get meet and greet and ask for hotel voucher and taxi payment. Again, we are not required to give you this. It is late and we have early AM charter. Paid for the hotel and charter as we were not going to lose 3 days of vacation. So we get back 7/7 KDV-NAN-LAX no problems, and I put on a full court press to get paid for hotel in LAX and NAN and taxi both ways in NAN and per diem and refund on NAN-KDV for my wife and I. On 7/10 after much back and forth and sending receipts 3x they finally agreed to a refund via wire transfer, but it takes 21 days. August 1, I write and ask where is the money? Response we will check into it. August 5th, I write again and finally get a response saying I will be paid by the 9th nada. Wrote them again, but it is time to let everyone know how things are a Fiji Airways! Fiji Airway is great if things go right but when they do not, they are completely incompetent. I am out for the hotels and per diem at over $850 not even counting the charter. If flying to Fiji from the USA consider that your choices are direct flights from LAX and SFO and Fiji Airways at about 11+ hours or Qantas to Syndey and back or Air New Zealand to Auckland and back at more like 18+ of travel time. The choices are not great! We loved Fiji, but Fiji Airways is horrible (maybe worse that horrible) when things do not go right.

### "charged 240 for bags!"
Not Verified |   We were charged 240 for bags! the agents at the check in were so rude and disrespectful. They lied to us out right and told us we were allowed only one bag each for carry on including a purse. Watching at the gate half the people had at least two bags. They charged us for seats but didn’t give us the seats? Never fly this airline again.

### “food is delicious”
Not Verified | Fiji Airways has the best legroom and the food is delicious, it has the best headphones but sadly you have to be told to keep your window shade up and give your headphones back at the end of the flight. Staff is great but not coordinating a lot.

### "flight and experience was great"
Great Service, My flight and experience was great. Flight departed and arrived on time with excellent inflight service. Seats were comfortable on A330.

### "Fantastic day flight"
Not Verified |   Fantastic day flight. Cabin crew were very friendly and attentive with great meal and drinks service. Highly recommend Fiji Airways. I am now considering using Fiji Airways to fly to the US later in the year/early next year because of this experience. Their A350 looks good and if the crew are are as good on their A350s then the competition needs to watch out.

### "they refused to refund my ticket"
Not Verified |   I recently had the misfortune of booking a flight with Fiji Airways, and it was an absolute nightmare from start to finish. I was scheduled for a flight from San Francisco to Sydney with a transit through Fiji. Sounds straightforward, right? Wrong. Nowhere on their Fiji Airways website did they bother to mention anything about a transit visa requirement for certain passports if the transit time in Fiji is more than 3 hours. It was a deliberate oversight, in my opinion, a sneaky tactic to squeeze more money out of unsuspecting travelers. I've never heard of any other country requiring transit visa for such short time of >3 hours, how crazy is that? And to add insult to injury, they refused to refund my ticket when I found out about this ridiculous requirement at the airport. Fiji Airways conveniently omitted this crucial information, leaving me stranded with both inconvenience and financial burden and having to change my plans last minute. As if that wasn't enough, I won a bid to be upgraded to business class, thinking I'd at least have a bit of comfort amidst this chaos. But on arrival at the airport, they casually informed me that due to a flight change, they were downgrading me back to economy. Did anyone bother to contact me beforehand about this change? Of course not. And the cherry on top? Trying to get a refund for the upgrade has been an absolute nightmare, with Fiji Airways dragging their feet and taking forever to process it. They're nothing but a money-making scam, with no clear information provided upfront for travelers. They lure you in with the promise of cheap and affordable flights, only to hit you with hidden fees at every turn. Save yourself the headache and choose a reputable airline instead. Fiji Airways should be ashamed of themselves for the way they treat their customers and everyone should know about how much of a joke Fiji Airways is.

### "Extremely terrible service"
The flight was from Melbourne to Suva with change in Nadi with same airline. The Melbourne to Nadi flight got delayed and i missed the flight to Suva. Instead making accommodation arrangements to catch next day early morning flight, the airline was telling me to go and look for a relatives house to stay in and make my own way to the airport in the morning. It was not until the affected passengers got angry that the airline made accommodation, dropoff and pickup arrangements. Extremely terrible service.

### "All our bags were damaged"
All our bags were damaged. It was as if the staff had thrown the bags intentionally. The hard suitcase was cracked and the cloth suitcase had its extending handle damaged. In a previous flight the year before, there was no diabetic meal for my father. I asked 2 different air hostess after he wasn't served and each would go to the back of the plane and not return. After half an hour i asked a 3rd air hostess who went back and tried to show us that we did not enter in the preference. Absolutely very bad customer service from baggage handlers to the air hostess who try and hide inside a plane and avoid you and not own up immediately.

### "advise people to avoid Fiji Airways"
We flew with Fiji Airways from Vancouver to Auckland, with a stop over in Nadi on the way back. Our flight TO Auckland was fine. Nothing special but nothing terrible. However, our flight from Nadi home to Vancouver was terrible, and enough that I would advise people to avoid Fiji Airways. For some reason they needed to change the plane, but didn't notify any of their customers. So they ended up moving everyone's seats, but not telling them before boarding the plane. We had paid for certain seats as and it was only 5 minutes before boarding that we found that these had been moved. I tried talking to a gate agent - who blamed the check in agent for not telling me - but HE was the check in agent!When contacting Fiji Airways after the flight, their only response was "we're sorry. They did refund the price I paid for the seats I selected (or they are in the process of doing so), but offered no other compensation or act of making it right. Their total disregard for the well being of their travellers is absolutely appalling. In addition, their seat fees, baggage fees and other fees are some of the highest I've ever seen. So their "good deal" prices are rarely that. Save yourself the hassle and book with someone else.

### "Really disappointing"
They included my snowboard gear in the price for the flight out (I checked the website to confirm this, and also double checked with the gate agent in Singapore before checking the bag), then stung me with a 470cad charge for it when I took the return leg of my flight from Nadi. The attendant had no interest in resolving the issue and would not allow me to speak with a supervisor after repeatedly saying 'I don't have the authority to waive the charge'. I've been going through the complaints procedure which has taken weeks now and it's like talking to a wall. Definitely recommend looking elsewhere if you are travelling for an adventure holiday. The rest of the service is very average, the entertainment is limited and food quality is standard-poor. For the extra baggage cost I could have flown direct with a different superior airline. Really disappointing end to my trip.

### “never fly this airline”
The airline is bad with all the food being sub standard and the tickets being overpriced. The aircraft flight was very turbulent both physically and actually. We managed to land about 2h late and we pushed back 1h late. Conclusion, never fly this airline.

### "terrible customer service"
We have had nothing but problems with our booking and follow customer service. A staff member at Melbourne airport did not follow correct procedure and would not allow check in causing my partner to miss his flight and ongoing connections. This cost us thousands of dollars in additional flights. We also emailed the customer care team with updates on our booking references and they still managed to get it wrong and separated us on the return flight. After hours of trying to rectify this they said they would refund an upgraded seat and sit us together. We followed instructions to the letter and next thing we know we get an email saying we wouldn’t be getting the approved refund. Back in the phone and they say no, we are eligible and they will follow up. On and on we go still no refund. Just terrible customer service.

### "most appalling"
I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with the multiple discrepancies in the information provided by staff, which have led to a significant overpayment on my part and an extremely frustrating experience. If I had been provided with the correct information I would have shipped this bag back to Sydney for $340 through DHL. Which I had organised prior but after speaking with your staff I decided to bring the bag with me on the plane and in the end, your staff damaged my bag and my snowboards which caused irreparable damage. Despite my efforts to clarify the extra baggage fees through emails and calls, I received inconsistent solutions from different representatives. On the 29th December, I sent a detailed email asking for the cost breakdown, it was advised it would be $396AUD for the oversized bags and extra luggage to Sydney. I asked for more clarity and received no response which prompted me to call up. On the 17th of January I was assured that I dont need to pay the $396AUD for the extra oversized bag and that since it is sporting equipment I can split my baggage allowance into two& I had to pay $190CAD for oversize fee, I was assured that I would have notes listed on my reservation to assure this, only to be given conflicting information on subsequent calls and at the check-in counter. The promised email confirmation never arrived, leading to a call on the 18th of January, where a representative confirmed the arrangement and noted it on the system for the check-in staff. However, upon reaching the check-in counter on the 19th of January, there were no visible notes, and the assistance provided was unhelpful. This caused delays and stress at the check in counter whom advised that we need to pay the extra baggage fee & the oversize fee and they will raise a complaint on their end so we can then reach out after to get a refund. Extra paid was $470CAD, which was meant to cover all the way to Sydney. To make matters worse, on the 21st of January, I was shocked to learn that the extra baggage fees were not covered all the way to Sydney, as previously indicated we had to pay another 260FJD, which was strange as we were also advised that we only needed to pay extra 120FJD at most here as we have 2 bags each due to flying business, when it came to check in, it was advised we had to pay again for the extra bag. This has resulted in me paying four times the initially agreed-upon amount, causing significant financial and time-related inconvenience. The total in AUD paid for this service was around $750 AUD. To make matters worse, my snowboards were damaged by the negligence of Fiji Airways staff, these snowboards were new and was damaged in transit from Fiji airlines As a frequent international traveler, I must emphasize that this experience with Fiji Airways has been the most appalling in my extensive flying history. I fly overseas five times a year, and the lack of consistency in advice and misinformation have tarnished my perception of your airline.

### "made to pay $200 on the spot"
My family flew with carry on luggage only because Fiji air charges an outrageous $200 per check in bag. But what they don't make clear at the time of ticket purchase is that they only allow 15 pounds per bag. This is ridiculous because an average carry on bag can weigh over 5 pounds empty. I travel a lot for work and every other airline enforce carry on size only, never weight. My wife and I checked in at the main counter and our bags were 2-3 pound over and they wanted $400 from us each way! We managed to comically take some cloths out and wear to get the bags to 15 pounds and then got a tag that we met the weight. Meanwhile my sister-in-law went straight to boarding gate with her carry on and when boarding started Fiji Air started to call out anyone who did not pre-check in at the main counter. Fiji Air keeps scales at the boarding gate(SFO) and they weighed her bag and she was 20 lbs, normal for any other airlines. But they would not let her open har bag and take out 5 lbs, she was made to pay $200 on the spot. $200 is a fortune for her. Fiji Air rakes in a fortune from unsuspecting travelers. Beware!

### "payments were short"
Worst airline I've ever dealt with. We had three tickets booked and had them refunded on compassionate grounds (Fiji agreed to a full refund). We had our other flights with Singapore airlines and Air New Zealand refunded immediately without issue. They claimed they made the bank transfer to my bank for the full amounts, but actually short changed me by 100 GBP per ticket. It was completely impossible to talk to someone about this I managed to get one response from someone in accounts claiming they'd paid the full amount but when I spoke to my bank the bank confirmed that the payments were short by a hundred pounds per ticket and it was effectively impossible to talk to anyone from Fiji Airlines about it. The complaint form on their website was practically ignored, I sent through several follow ups. But it was impossible to have a contextual follow-up conversation with anyone (due to having to fill out a website complaints form for every "response" I wanted to send) let alone on the phone. No one would talk to me about it because everyone passed responsibility. This was my first experience with them, and I will try to avoid booking with them ever again. Especially given the context of our compassionate cancelation issue - exactly sort of time when you need great service, and Fiji Airways drops the ball completely. They're very happy to take reservations, but that's it.

### “gave the best service”
Not Verified |  Better and more comfortable flatbed than other airlines and the cabin steward Jovesa Natadra gave the best service we have had ever. I was travelling with Mrs Ranjanben Patel.

### “flight attendant was very rude”
Our flight attendant was very rude. The only rude Fijian we met on our entire vacation. We were told we could not disembark before business class even though other travelers were disembarking from economy. I was feeling unwell & she was very rude. I needed to use the rest room earlier in the flight & she was very rude about having to move her cart. Not friendly at all, you need to have a talk with her about her behavior.

### "had my duty free alcohol confiscated"
The flight itself was pretty good, can't really complain about that. Unfortunately Fiji's Nadi airport is an absolute disgrace. It is one of the few remaining backwards airports that do not allow you to transit duty free alcohol for no explainable reason. I had my duty free alcohol (packaged, sealed and with receipt) confiscated because of their rules, but could then walk 3 meters past the security gate and into their own duty free section and buy alcohol there and take on the aircraft.

### "The seats are too tight"
New aircraft, with narrow aisles. The seats are too tight, during mealtime, I could barely move my arms to eat food. My luggage was damaged, I complained at the airport straight away, they took photos, filled out the forms, etc. and after 1 month, the case is not solved yet. . They started serving the special requests, then took more than 2 hours to serve everyone. We had to hold our rubbish for over 2 hours until it was collected. We boarded at midnight, and the lights were turned off only over 3:30 am. People were so tired, that most of us slept before the food was served and before the lights were turned off. The crew seemed friendly, but it looks like they don’t have enough staff. It was my first experience with Fiji Airways, and it will be the last one. They have the worst customer service I’ve ever seen.

### "luggage did not arrive with me"
I boarded Qantas from Melbourne to Sydney and then Fiji Airways from Sydney to Nadi. My luggage did not arrive with me. I was promised the luggage will arrive the next morning but it only arrived at 12 midnight. Until today 20 July 2023, they have yet to email my baggage delay report. I am not able to claim my insurance for this. They do not reply to my multiple emails sent. What's worse is that my luggage is badly scratched.

### "Fiji Airways was ok"
Not Verified |  Fiji Airways was ok. Service is not great and they run out of the meal options early in the servicing. They also seemed to dawdle them have to always rush at the end of the flight to feed everyone. Planes are a bit old so I guess if you’re paying full price it’s worth going elsewhere on this route.

### "staff went above and beyond"
Not Verified |  On 10th May I had to fly home because I had broken my ankle quite badly in Fiji. Fiji Air were very accommodating . From when we entered the Airport Building in Nadi to when we landed in Sydney they were faultless. Both ground staff and cabin staff went above and beyond to help my husband and I. Nothing was too much effort. This is the 4th time we have flown with them and never had any problems whatsoever and this last experience was exceptional. Thank you Fiji Air.

### "They were all amazing"
Not Verified |  Firstly I would like to give thanks to all the crew members for this flight. They were all amazing. Flight attendant Miss Lavinia took care us me my mum and my daughter for all our needs from food to refreshments. And overall excellent customer service. She gets 5 star from all of us. And the pilot 5 star for him. Mr. Singh smooth landing. We got him when we left LA and on our way back he was our pilot. The credit also goes to co- pilots too. Thank you for your service. Loved it. Secondly, I have traveled on Emirates Airline, United Airlines , American Airline, Alaskan airlines, but I have never seen a service like this before. The Fiji Airways aircraft was super super clean. The seats were super comfortable even for economy area super spaces to stretch you legs even for a tall person as tall as 6'4",. Food were great. Restrooms were clean. Clean is what I am talking about. Most air lines I have travel by the end of the flight the restroom is totally upside down super messy floors trash can filled sink water flooded. But not with Fiji Airways. Everything was well taken care of. Thank you Fiji Airways Flight FJ 5053 on March 29th, 2023 to all the crew.

### "nobody can say where my luggage is"
The flight wasn't bad, but the airline lost my luggage and is unable to determine where my luggage is. The luggage search runs through an external company (Swissport) who also have no contact person. So nobody can say where my luggage is. The airline does not have a counter at New Zealand airports. The only way is to use an online form to indicate that you have lost your luggage. What's the point if I get from A to B, but my luggage just disappears like that and above all I'm helpless because I can't make contact.

### "could not be prouder of this airline"
This airline is really making us proud. I had the opportunity to fly with Fiji Airways in August to Kiribati and back and then this month to LAX and back and I could not be prouder of how this airline is coming out of the pandemic. I had wonderful sets of crew who had great personalities, interacted with passengers, and remembered frequent flyers. Unlike crew in the US who hide in the galley to gossip among themselves after service, the Fiji crew are on their feet, preparing carts for the next service, interacting with passengers in the galley, and making rounds with water. They had a mini snack bar set up in each section of the cabin, offered hot towels before breakfast and their meal quality is top notch. I mean who can complain about pancakes for breakfast! The airline is punching above its weight and it deserves to be recognised for it.

### "refund will take 6-8 months"
SFO to Nadi in August, the flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues - not a problem. The problem was the airline has just notified me that the refund will take 6-8 months. That is unacceptable.

### "awful check-in experience"
I had a very stressful and awful check-in experience with Fiji airways on 6th August in Singapore. My partner and I were there almost 3hrs before our flight to check-in. The staff at counter couldn’t find our booking. Fiji airways claimed that we did not pay the fee for change of flight and called us multiple times but no one answered. That was a lie and clearly trying to shift the blame onto us,  we have screenshot to prove that we were supposed to be refunded 50cents for this change of flight. The reservation staff in Fiji wanted us to pay the penalty so we could get a spot on the flight, which to me is ridiculous. I bought my ticket on 18 June 2022, they have a policy that allows people to change flight without a fee, i would however have to top up a date difference. There was no difference and it was in fact, 50 cents cheaper than my original flight like I mentioned. There were back and forth calls between the on-site manager at the airport and the reservations manager in Fiji but the whole thing went on for 2hrs and no one called us. The manager said someone from Fiji will call us but no one did. About 15mins later, I decided not to continue waiting and asked the on-site manager to call Fiji side for me. I finally had the chance to speak to the person in Fiji. She insisted to that we were supposed to pay a penalty for change of flight but we did not. She eventually agreed to put me on the flight, making it as if it was out of goodwill when it is not our fault. I love Fiji and that was why I decided to go back once the borders opened up. Your staff’s insincerity and shifting the blame onto us was really distasteful.

### "The ground service was exemplary"
The ground service was exemplary, we had to change our flight due a family emergency involving hospital and surgery. The ground staff could not have been more helpful, we are here on holidays purely due to the staff at Sydney airport. On check in you get meals vouchers for airside dining as the use of the code share lounge is not available during these COVID times. Boarding was on time and very efficient, the allocated seat 17G was a great space for a mere 4 hour flight. On board the staff went over and above with service. It's always the little touches that bring the biggest smiles, a genuine greeting, and wonderful smile (it's there being the mask), and most of all the personnel thank you to every passenger in business. The food service was prompt and thoughtful. Having said that my partner's gluten free meal was inedible, that's why it's 4 stars. On arrival the procedure to get off was well handled. It was a truly great way to start a long awaited overseas holiday. Highly recommended great work Fiji Airways.

### "running after them to get my money back"
I was supposed to fly to Melbourne Through Fiji in December 2021, and bought the ticket on October 2021 from their website. After about weeks I was informed that my flight need to be changed and I need to have a "36 hour transit quarantine" as their rule has changed. I did not accept this change and requested for a refund and have been running after them to get my money back, have emailed few times, but it is just radio silence from there reservation, and local offices cant help.

### "has been over 300 days now"
I booked my fights in Dec 2019 for travel in Nov 2020. Flights were cancelled in Sep 2020. I filled out the Fiji online form for my refund of $4350. Initially I got a response that it would take 90+ days. I tried contacting again with the response that I was in the queue and it would be 120+ days. Contacted again, no response. Filled out the online form for status update, no response. Initiated dispute with credit card company and they could do nothing because of the amount of time that had passed. It has been over 300 days now.

### "still didn't get a refund"
We booked flight from Auckland, New Zealand to Nadi, Fiji with Fiji Airways for End of March 2020. When new restrictions came due to COVID-19 that only citizen of Fiji are allowed to enter, they have cancelled pur flight. I am writing with Fiji Airways till now for 14 months and still didn't get a refund. They want me to accept a voucher which I could use for the next flight but with validity till End of 2021. This is a joke, as it's still not allowed to enter to Fiji.

### "waiting for a refund for 9+ months now"
Not Verified |  We were supposed to Fiji Air for our trip to Australia last year but it was cancelled due to Covid. We have been waiting for a refund for 9+ months now and are told we are in the queue for a refund. Lately customer service has just been ignoring our requests for an update.

### "my refund was in the queue"
Asked for a ticket refund in October, received an answer on Nov 4th saying that my refund was in the queue. Today it's Dec 18th and still no refund. I sent 3 email follow-ups and I never received a reply. I tried to file a customer support request from their website. I added the email screenshot and clicked Submit, I was taken to a screen that says I've been blocked. Is there even a refund queue? Will I ever receive any refund?

### "Totally soured my hope to get to Fiji one day"
Not Verified |  Due to covid my flight was cancelled - well they kept putting me on a flight for a month in the future - like I can change work plans to travel any time and all the while covid is happening. I had to call to cancel - they offered credit. No, I want a refund. They had to get approval to refund and against all odds, the lady called back to say a refund had been initiated. This is May 2020. 30 days later with no refund, I call and they say it is taking 60 days to refund (beyond me as Alaska Air refunded in 48 hours). In 60 days I call, said refunds taking 90 days as they have so many refunds. It can't be the mechanics of the refund because how hard is that? They must be broke? Today after over 100 days of waiting, I called. The lady says it is taking 90 days. I said it is well past 90 days. She says, I will work to get your refund within a week! I called my credit card company and expect resolution only because of my credit card company. Totally soured my hope to get to Fiji one day. I wonder if they will make it through covid? I won't ever be flying with them if I can help it.

### "yet to receive our promised refund"
We booked flights to Vanuatu in February 2020 and scheduled to leave in May, but COVID came and the flight was canceled. We followed ALL of the proper instructions, canceled our flights and were promised a refund. Fiji Airways has not reached out since that cancelation (I've had to initiate all inquiries, which may suggest they are hoping that customers forget about the money lost/awaiting refund. It is now 5+ months since the cancelation and we have yet to receive our promised refund. If it can be avoided, I will definitely choose not to fly with Fiji Airways if this is how it chooses to treat its customers.

### "gave me the amount in credits"
Nadi to Auckland booked for 31 March. 2 of my flights got cancelled because of the corona virus situation. I  explained to Fiji Airways that I cannot fly into and out Fiji anymore because borders are closed and in the future I cannot support the trip anymore but they don't want to refund tickets. They just gave me the amount in credits (the route I booked with them).

### "was once proud of this airline"
Sydney to Labasa via Nadi. I had connecting Flight to Labasa from Sydney, which meant I had to check out x2 and check in x3. Fiji Airways informed me that my luggage will be transferred and I can pick them up in Labasa when I landed. I had 23kg check-in and 7 kg carry-on. However, this did not happen as I was told that I had to check my luggage out each time and check them in making it impossible to buy some water or even go to the toilet at the airports considering I had to check in at 4:15 am. I was due to return on the 31st of March but due to COVID we had to change to earlier date flight which was then 22nd March. The airline demanded that we pay quite a bit extra to have the flight secured. Lucky for me that my husband checked my flight back time on line and saw that it was cancelled. We did not receive any email or phone call from Fiji Airways for cancelling our flight. When my husband rang customer service at Fiji Airlines he was told that my flight had been rebooked for same day but at 1030 am from Nadi to Sydney. How stupid can anyone be when my flight was from Labasa lending at Nadi at 1:30 pm and I had to catch a flight to Sydney at 1030 am with the same airline company. When my husband pointed that out then my flight was changed to Virgin at 1800hrs. Not only Fiji Airways caused all this problem and hassle but also booked me on a cheaper Virgin flight back to Sydney with horrible, salty and tasteless food with no bread and dessert (at least I could have eaten that) but also kept the difference of the price. I am ashamed to say that I was once proud of this airline where I am originally from.

### "cancelled our departing flight"
Not Verified |  Myself and my partner booked return tickets about 9 months ago. They rescheduled the flights about 4 months ago giving us stopover in Fiji and making our connecting flight the day before, they also did it on our return flight just a few days ago. Not only did they only allow us a 25 minute connecting time between flights on our return. They then gave us a departing flight for the week after and didn't change the connecting flight. So we were again expected to time travel a week back. They have now cancelled our departing flight out of Tokyo Narita and we had to purchase last minute tickets on Qantas. When we arrived at the airport we noticed our Qantas flight was a joint flight with Fiji airways and the plane wasn't even half full. They are the most horrible company to deal with.

### "they hung up on me"
Melbourne to Nadi. Please look at all your paperwork and the fine print, I have had to postpone my wedding due to this COVID-19, the change is by 2 months from May 2020 to July 2020 Fiji Airways are now telling us to change the flight it will be an extra charge per person over $100. When I asked the operator to speak with a supervisor she kept telling me they not available I advised her I was able to hold as I needed to confirm the cost and if there's anything they could do to help us given our situation and help our guests. Instead, they hung up on me. I would not recommend this company based on their customer service

### "has been a nightmare"
Los Angeles to Nadi. Never book with Fiji Airways. Their gate agent in Los Angelas denied me boarding and stranded me at LAX (en route from Toronto to Auckland) and did not cancel my flight so that I could rebook using the remaining flight credit. The reason I was denied boarding was that I was unable to prove that I had onward travel from New Zealand booked before the boarding closed. She left my status as a 'no-show' despite the fact that I was at the gate. This caused me to have to book a new flight at full price for the next date. I have been dealing with Fiji Airways call centre staff for over a month trying to get a refund on only the unused portion of my ticket (Los Angeles to Auckland) and they have consistently promised to update me via email or phone call and have never followed up once. They have told me to email addresses which don't even exist anymore as my emails bounced to both of those addresses. Trying to get anywhere with Fiji Airways has been a nightmare and I would recommend avoiding this airline at all costs.

### "flight attendants were useless"
Nadi to Melbourne. Fiji Airways is really poor, would not recommend. We selected our seat online and upon checkin we were asked to go to the bassinet seats as we have a 1 year old. They advised us no one else would be sitting in the seat next to us. Well they decided to sit someone (who could clearly not fit in one seat) so took up more than their fare share of my seat. The flight attendants were useless and couldn’t find a solution. Food below average. Services: TV and headset very aged.

### "truly have good attitude"
One cabin crew in my section really lacked finesse. When I pressed the call button to inform him of my broken entertainment screen he came and barked "You want something? When I asked to read the newspaper, the same crew told me I have to wait as he is reading it, which he was not, it was folded in his hands but I still said okay I will wait, hours passed and he never brought the newspaper, it was only when a younger crew went through the cabin with water did he realise I had asked for the newspaper and brought it to me without having to ask. Other crew members were extremely friendly and helpful. They were very accommodating and thoroughly enjoyed their job. Especially the two ladies in my section, they have very infectious smiles that can brighten anyone's mood, they truly have good attitude. The food on this leg was better than the going leg. Check-in agent at Singapore was very rude to me.

### "poor amenities offered"
Nadi to Singapore. Took FJ1361 on 29th of December after my flight on the 28th got canceled due to a cyclone. It is understandable it was a weather related cancellation but what is not understandable is they planned a supplementary flight approximately 12 hours before the scheduled time of flight but they did not have crew to operate the flight. As a result of this our flight was delayed by 2 hours and we missed our connection from Singapore and I was forced to pay $1,300 to buy a new ticket in Singapore. The crew were friendly and tried their best to ensure we make our connection but alas the 2 hour delay led us to missing our flight. The quantity of food was poor, we had to ask for second serves, the entertainment was poor. Their team leader for economy was very friendly, helpful and patient, there was this other female senior cabin crew working economy who was just as good. The friendliness of the crew is the only saving grace here. The lavatory was basic, had no lotion, no moist towels, no toothbrush etc. I am extremely disappointed with the poor amenities offered on Nadi - Singapore flights.

### "handled issue extremely poorly
Suva to Nadi. We had originally booked a return ticket but the first part was cancelled due to the cyclone. E mail but no follow up, compensation or chance to rebook. All their lines said busy. Anyway this was a short uneventful flight, on Fiji time in that it was late but being under half hour didn’t matter. Check in was the most basic experienced and boarding was via steps from the back. Would not recommend as they handled the cyclone issue extremely poorly,

### "cancelled because of cyclone"
Nadi to Singapore. Flight got cancelled because of cyclone, which is understandable. However no news from the airlines for the next 36h on a new flight. No compensation or accommodation because it was outside of their control. Called in more than 5 times was put on hold only to be hung up after waiting patiently for 1.5h. No customer service. Plane food was average at best. Only one meat option and they only offered chicken. Seats have decent leg room but are cushions are thin. In-air entertainment is ok but screens on the plane are tiny and quality is terrible.

### "you get what you pay for"
Auckland to Tokyo via Nadi. Average airline. Chairs are worn, little food options, entertainment was dated and not a lot of options and also for one of my flights my chair was actually broken so I had to lean back the entire flight except for landing and meals where I had to sit away from chair so it would stay up. Cabin crew were lovely, however I left behind something in my seat, contacted airline  and item was "not found". Overall you get what you pay for, want a cheap trip a to b then great value for money.

### "Super helpful people"
Nadi to Sydney. A bit of delay but apart from that one of the best services we've experienced. Super helpful people, surprisingly good food as for the economy class and great communication. This plane doesn't come with in-seat entertainment.

### "they asked for the ticket"
Nadi to Christchurch. At the check-in they asked for the ticket out of New Zealand. It was a ticket from Auckland to Santiago. The agency from I've bought the ticket didn't sent the "booking reference" of the flight, but I had the booking  proof and receipt of payment. Fiji Airways refuse to check me in because I didn't have the booking reference. They didn't even offer to help or suggest any solution, just saying I had 20min until they close the check-in. It was night time in Europe, and after 20min and more than 60 Euros on the phone I got the mighty booking reference.

### "Would recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Auckland to Fiji via Los Angeles with Fiji Airways. Would recommend this airline. I lost my phone and the cabin crew went through the area and found it and were able to open the seat to retrieve it with engineers help. I really thank you or I would be lost in L.A.

### "They cancelled my flight"
Sydney to Nadi. They cancelled my flight, and even after constant phone calls they only confirmed alternative accomodation the day before we flew. They refused compensation and when you complain they don't respond. Its a shame that there in flight experience isn't too bad - it is simply their reservations staff are understaffed or incompetent. The CEO in the inflight magazine encourages people to email feedback and yet they have not replied. They may be cheap but we discovered after our holiday they are well known for late cancellations.

### "flight was overbooked"
Melbourne to Nadi. Booked my flight 1st April to fly on 19th August, get an email 3 days before we fly that our flight was overbooked and changed to fly out the next day. By then our accomodation has all been locked in and for any changes via booking.com will be a fee of the whole booking. I called the airline, emailed them and all they could do is say sorry, there was nothing they could do. Then coming back from Nadi to Melbourne, we had trouble checking in, we were told the flight was overbooked and that they opened a seat for us to accommodate getting both of us on the flight. The seats were separate to each other. I later found out when sitting next to a young couple with a 9-month year old, that I took their baby's seat where he was meant to sleep in and that one of the flight attendants said that they overbooked flights because a lot of the time people don't show up and that a lot of the airlines do it too. The flight attendants are lovely but the airline needs to get its act together and stop messing people around with their booking.

### "canceled both my flights"
I recently booked my travel to Fiji from NZ and without notice the airline canceled both my flights. My hotel bookings are done and are non refundable. I told them that I have to be back in NZ at any cost on 1st Sept but they have given me the flight back on 4th. The reservations team have no sense of customer service. They have been passing on my complaint/ concern from the email team to the so called manager who is behind the scenes and is not available to provide any response to me. They asked me to wait for 48 hours for a response and now after continuous follow up, they have asked me to follow up after 48 hours. With less than a week left for my travel, I have got no response for the team. I would never recommend anyone to use this airline.

### "kind to me and my family"
Los Angeles to Nadi . Getting from Toronto to LAX was very time consuming and almost resulted in us missing our Fiji Airways flight to Nadi. We were quite upset but the wonderful treatment of the Fiji airways staff alleviated the stress. They were so kind to me and my family and seem very genuine. Coming back from Nadi was a breeze with no delays. Fiji Air had a wide variety of drinks, delicious meals and the IFE was substantial in the range of movies, games and music selections offered. Indeed the level of service, professionalism, and attention to passenger needs was indicative of a 5 star airline. These ticket prices are very, very competitive and they are adding A350s to the LAX route in a few months.

### "operated by Miami Air"
Brisbane to Nadi with Fiji Airways. Hidden fees, expensive, cartoons for entertainment and operated by Miami Air. This was booked as a Qantas flight however this is simply a codeshare so don't expect any decent standards of service. When I arrived at the airport I had to pay extra for a surfboard, Qantas allow surfboards for free. Then got on an old plane for this 3.5 hr flight operated by Miami Air which had one screen every ten rows on which they played a video of Tom and Jerry. They served terrible meals. This was not a budget flight nor was it advertised as a budget airline it was advertised as a Qantas flight. So with the additional surfboard charges it cost $800 for a 3.5 hour flight.

### "no individual IFE screens"
Nadi to Melbourne on one of their Boeing 737-800s. The journey was almost 6 hours and I felt cramped as it is a much smaller aircraft to the A330s they sometimes operate to Sydney and Melbourne. There was no wifi which wasn’t really a significant issue but there were no individual IFE screens, only overheads showing two films of the airline’s choice in intervals of the flight. Cabin service was ok and the meal was dinner, which also wasn’t bad.

### "no room to move "
Apia, Samoa to San Francisco with Fiji Airways. Seats were ridiculous! There was no room to move at all. Approx 2.5 feet between my own seat back and the seat back in front of me. 11 hours in the middle and I could barely walk. The staff were professional, courteous, and helpful. This was my 3rd time to the South Pacific/Asia and it was the most uncomfortable trip of all. We were simply sardines.

### "disappointed with service at Nausori"
Suva to Nadi. As a frequent flyer with Fiji Link am disappointed with the level of service at Nausori Airport. I was due to fly FJ24 but due to issues with the aircraft they had to downgrade the aircraft to an ATR42 which meant at least 20 pax had to be offloaded. They were seeking volunteers, I happily volunteered. I was given a hotel which was pathetic but that is another story. The next day, I was told my pickup will be at 5.15 from the hotel. 2 taxis came, took other passengers that were assigned to them and left. I was waiting with two other guys, finally a taxi came I asked the driver about my pickup the driver said he was not aware. He called Fiji Airways and spoke to the rep and her reply was "I don't know about any Avneel or whoever he is" much to my shock. Mind you the phone was on speaker and I could hear what she said. The two guys offered me a lift, when I got to the airport the rep responsible for arranging taxi started pushing the blame to the manager from last night rather than apologising. When I requested the check-in staff for a window seat she rudely said "there is only one seat left". I have always had issues at Nausori, never at Nadi or Labasa or other airports I have traveled with Fj.

### "Staff friendly and attentive"
Los Angeles to Nadi. Great airline! From the moment I stepped on board to the moment I left the arrival gate I felt safe, secure and well taken care of. The seats were very comfortable and had lots of leg room, the inflight entertainment varied from movies to video games which was very fun, and the inflight food was included in the flights cost and was quite delicious, served at very appropriate times, and the portion was filling. Staff were friendly and attentive!

### "Our flight got cancelled"
Labasa to Nadi. Our flight got cancelled on the 5th of Jan from Labasa to Nadi due to bad weather. We made about 30 phone calls to Fiji Link both in Suva and Nadi. Each time a different story was told. Absolutely no help has been provided. We were meant to be back at work today. It's 3 days now. We asked Fiji Link to give us a date when we could travel back to Brisbane so that we can inform work. Fiji link failed to do that as well. No supplimentary flights have been arranged,we have not received a single phone call,text or email to say they are making arrangements to fly us out ASAP. We even went down to the local airport only to find locals travelling out of the Island. How about those who are visitors here and have to return to work and attend to medical appointments?They fail to answer questions and are not supportive at all.

### "Terrible service"
Terrible service. Flights to and from Singapore cancelled with no notice. Worst customer service I’ve ever seen. No care given to the passenger throughout. Cancelled flights at last minute are the normal thing for this airline. Check online to see how many are cancelled. Warning do not fly with Fiji Airways if you want to have a holiday or business trip that is on time. Terrible, terrible service. Worst ever airline. Old planes also.

### "is a delay of 24 hrs"
Had a flight from Singapore to Nadi and 3,5 hrs before departure get an email that there is a delay of 24hrs. Long time on the phone, line was several time interrupted. No offer how to help staying overnight in Singapore or how to help with the cancellation of the non-refundable hotel on Fiji. For problems caused for the customer Fiji Airways does not care.

### "space was pretty cramped"
Nadi to Adelaide. Ground service very good, very fast check in. Business class lounge was new, nicely decorated and well stocked with food/snacks, drinks and newspapers. Only thing: loud music. Flight: a very tired and old plane, seats very uncomfortable for a 6 hours flight. Seat controls did not work properly. Personal space was pretty cramped; sleeping impossible. Blanket an small pillow were provided. No amenity kit. Service was OK, nothing special, the same for food. Very small portions and service was over within les than 1 hour after take-off. We had expected more reading other reviews. That this flight is a direct one is a plus, however for better seats and service I would not mind a stop.

### "very relaxing way of traveling"
We flew Brisbane to Honolulu return, stopping over in Fiji for a couple of days on both the outbound and return trips, and were quite happy with the service and comfort. The aircraft comprised B737-800 between Brisbane and Nadi and the slightly smaller B737-700 between Nadi and Honolulu. The Brisbane to Nadi flight was almost full, although we were lucky enough to score an empty seat between us. The Nadi-Honolulu flights stopped over briefly in Apia, Samoa on the way over and in Christmas Island, Kiribati on the way back. The Nadi to Apia leg of the outbound flight to Honolulu was totally full as was the Nadi to Brisbane return flight. However, the Apia to Honolulu and Honolulu to Nadi flights were both less than half full, so we had plenty of room to spread out. All flights departed on time and arrived early. There is not much in the way of in-flight entertainment on these older 737s, with their small retractable overhead screens, but apparently, Fiji Airways will soon be taking delivery of the first of their new 737MAX aircraft to be used on these routes, and these planes will have individual TV screens. We found the service to be quite friendly and relaxed and the food and drinks offered were more than adequate. As they say at the end of their safety briefings, welcome to Fiji time! Our only real criticism was a very hard landing in Brisbane at the end of the trip. However, overall we found this to be a very relaxing way of traveling between Brisbane and Honolulu.

### "could not answer any questions"
We were told there would be a one hour delay for 9 pm departure. At the end of that 1 hour we were told there be another hour delay. At the end of that hour we were told there would be another hour delay because we were changing planes. We received only 1 communication per hour and no explanation until the last announcement. When finally boarding we were told that due to the late nature of our flight that their own booking people would be re-booking all of our connecting flights for us and they would be waiting at the gate in LA with our new flights and boarding passes. That was a lie, it did not happen. All of us ended up having to go through re-booking in LA after exiting customs and security and nobody from Fiji Airways in LA had any idea why we were there. Most of our connecting flights were all missed and we were on our own booking connecting flights with 2 overwhelmed Fiji Air people. At every point where they said they would have things fixed for us, they lied. Their gate staff at Nadi were completely clueless and could not answer any questions!

### "Cabin service was adequate"
Hong Kong to Nadi. Basic but good considering that it was not a very long flight. Inflight entertainment was virtually non-existant because of small drop down screens. Cabin service was adequate and the hostesses were cheerful. The flight was smooth

### "I was not disappointed"
Nadi to Los Angeles. This was my second time flying on Fiji Airways, the first time being a few hours earlier when I flew from Brisbane to Nadi. This was a relatively long flight (nearly 11 hours) so I expected a different level of service and comfort and I was not disappointed. The  flight crew, including pilots, were polite, courteous and service oriented. We were  greeted with a warm "Bula" (hello) and a smile. The staff were great. For business class, I thought the cabin was a bit cramped (2-2-2 configuration) but the seats were comfortable and I was quite comfortable while sleeping. We were given a large pillow, a duvet and a blanket - more than adequate for comfort. I found the food on the flight to be better than average but not outstanding but then again the price point of Fiji Airways is very reasonable and thus this was not unexpected. The amenity kit offered was different in that it featured a hydrating mist in addition to the usual moisturizing cream, ear plus, socks, eye mask, etc. I found that to be a really nice touch and I must say that the scent of the moisturizer was wonderful. When given the chance, I will fly Fiji Airways again.

### Fiji Airways customer review
This was my first trip on Fiji Airways - I was en route to Los Angeles through Nadi from Brisbane. It was on a Boeing 737 which has always been one of my favorite aircraft to fly. The experience was excellent. We were greeted warmly by the crew with a "Bula". The cabin crew were courteous, gracious and warm. I noticed that some of the flight attendants took particular time with children. The seats were quite comfortable, thanks in part to the significant amount of pitch and a wonderful foot rest. The food on the flight was tasty and served with courtesy. Each seat was supplied with a large and comfortable pillow as well as a blanket which made the ride  more comfortable and made taking a nap quite easy. Departing the plane for my next flight was simplified by the cabin crew's excellent directions and instruction. I will definitely fly Fiji Airways again when there is an opportunity.

### "no customer service"
Port Vila to Suva via Nadi. Last year, great. This year, completely unreliable, misleading and no customer service. I was off loaded at the airport because the passengers that had checked-in before me had excess baggage and the plane was overweight. They preferred to off load passengers rather than the excess baggage. Months later I tried going again, and I got to my destination but then my return flight was cancelled. I was booked onto the next flight (3 days later) but missed my connecting international flight. Got stuck in Suva for an extra 2 days and was then given the wrong re-booked return flight details (in writing) and missed my unknowingly booked flight, and was then re-booked again on a non-direct flight. No compensation for the additional accommodation expenses was offered when requested. The customer service team then issued me a credit for my flight, but when I tried to use the credit I was then told I didn't have a credit. This was after days of correspondence confirming the contrary - and only written correspondence because their customer service phone number didn't work. My next trip has been cancelled consequently but not in sufficient time to have my accommodation bookings cancelled without charge. All I got from Fiji Airways was a 'sorry, there was a misunderstanding' with no further offer of assistance or attempt to rectify the situation. The 'Manager of Customer Service' was unavailable to make any further complaints to. In flight - the flight attendants are great but the food is a disgrace.

### "return flight had been cancelled"
My fiancé and I booked our honeymoon for November in Fiji and Fiji Airways offers direct flight between Hong Kong and Nadi. We have got everything booked (expensive non-refundable resort) and later found out that our return flight had been cancelled. We called customer care to see what they can do to protect us on another flight via Singapore or Melbourne on the same day (because obviously the hotel dates can’t be changed), and asked for compensation such as hotel for overlay due to additional transfer and taxi fee due to late arrival (after 12am) in Hong Kong. The response we got was that it is under their terms and conditions that they can cancel whatever flight they want, and that they won’t be giving us any sort of compensation, and if we are not satisfied then we can cancel our trip. This is probably the worst customer service from an airline I have ever encountered.

### "awesome in customer service"
Christchurch to Nadi. Fiji Airways are awesome in customer service and I will highly recommend this airline to my friends and family. The staff was awesome in attending passengers requirements and also with the call button service.

### "meal that was horrible"
I recently travelled San Francisco to Nadi. My meal preference was Muslim meal that was horrible. The meal on our way to Nadi for breakfast was pancakes with cream cheese, and was some sort of chicken tikka, a piece of naan and some rice. The meal on our way back for breakfast was an egg omelet and potatoes. I would suggest to find a new cook, and offer better food for the Muslims. I’m sure I am not the only one who ordered a muslim meal, perhaps the only one who will address this issue!

### "service was excellent"
Auckland to Nadi. Fiji Airways service was excellent and the staff was attending to calls immediately. I would recommend flying with Fiji airways again. Keep it up Fiji Airways.

### "our flight was re-booked"
Great disappointment that ruined my holiday. On the way to Honolulu 8th May there was a 5 hour lay over in Nadi airport. Decided to use the lounge so paid FJD $99 per person totalling FJD $198. They charged us twice. We decided to wait as foreign transaction does take few days to process hoping one of them will be auto cancelled. The two charges have been debited from my bank. Got in touch with Fiji Airways, took a couple of days to get an email saying the refund will be processed. the refund still hasn't come through as of 17th May. Was supposed to be on the flight back to NZ 18th 1am (night of 17th). So booked accommodation checking out 17th so that we could leave luggage in the hotel then go to the airport that night. Got an email, out of blue, on the night of the 16th that our flight was re-booked, leaving 18th 9.30am due to overweight, apparently their company policy is that overweight re schedule is not entitied to accommodation. Now we are spending the day finding accommodation and missing out on our planned tour. Have to pay an additional night accommodation that was not planned thanks to Fiji Airways.

### "showed great care and consideration"
My wife and I flew to Nadi from Adelaide via Melbourne on a Friday night flight (FJ930) and then direct back to Adelaide on Monday with Fiji Airlines (FJ961 booked the codeshare Qantas flight number as I'm a Gold FF) to make it a long weekend. At Melbourne Tullamarine we needed to do a quick baggage check at the gate counter prior to boarding and rather unfortunately my wife hit her head on the counter overhanging ledge as she stood up from getting her passport out of her bag. It was completely no-one's fault but she was clearly a little upset at the shock of the it all. Naturally the staff were concerned on her welfare at the time, but what impressed me greatly was after we boarded, a ground manager came on board the plane asked after her personally, offered us both a bottle of water and moved us to an exit row for greater comfort. A terrific gesture and showed great care and consideration. I found this attitude from everyone at Fiji Airlines, including the tremendous Tabua Club at Nadi airport. which has been stylishly upgraded. Well done Fiji Airways!

### "For the price we paid we were very happy"
Flew Fiji Airways from Brisbane to Los Angeles with a 5 hours stopover in Nadi. Flight to Nadi only had entertainment via a few screens and was rather poor, however service and meals were really good (for an airline). Ended up paying to go into the lounge in Nadi which was worth every cent - highly recommended. Flight from Nadi to Los Angeles was excellent and even managed to get a few extra seats to get some sleep. For the price we paid we were very happy.

### "I loved flying Fiji Airways"
Los Angeles to Sydney via Nadi. I loved flying Fiji Airways and I think it is absolutely value for money. At the time I bought my return ticket Sydney - LAX, Fiji Airways was about 30-40% cheaper than its competitors (United, Qantas etc.). Some reviews made me a bit hesitant to fly Fiji Airways, but I am glad that I did! The online check-in was easy and their ground personnel at the baggage drop counter was friendly and helpful. Also the boarding went smooth and all four flights I had departed on time. On one of my flights, just before take-off, a steward came to me and asked me whether I preferred to move to another seat that had an empty seat next to it, because of my height (6 foot 6/1.95 m.). I think this was very kind of him and in general I found the stewards on board very friendly and willing to help. The food and the in-flight entertainment was alright. It may not be as fancy or shiny as the food and entertainment you get at huge airlines like Emirates or Qatar, but for the money it was good value. For the meals you had a vegetarian and non-vegetarian option and the in-flight entertainment was sufficient. (again, Emirates may have a 150 movies to choose from and Fiji only 30, but you can't watch them all anyway) Also the seats were fine and just like any other company (besides maybe the more luxurious A380 seats). I would really like to recommend Fiji Airways to fly with if you want a good value for money. Don't expect too much luxury, but expect very friendly personnel, food, entertainment and seats that do the job and a company that brings you from A to B for 60-70% of the price of their competitors.

### "weren’t provided any meals on board"
Nadi to Auckland. If you are a parent of a child who is not a teenager do not use Fiji Airways. Our flight was delayed (understandable) due to a strike by their ground staff hence we weren’t provided any meals on board. They have a intercom announcement system yet they failed to inform us at the counter, over the system and at the boarding gate that meals won’t be provided and we were allowed to take a meal with us. I have a 1y 4m toddler, she grew hungry within an hour on the flight. An attendee just 2 rows ahead of me ignored me when I first asked for assistance and continued even when another passenger informed him I required help. The second time I reached out an tapped on his shoulder and excused myself asking for just a cup of water to make formula for my crying toddler, who by now was in a full on hunger tantrum. The attendee turned around and told me sternly that I would be attended to by his co-worker. When the second attendee approached me with the meal cart I asked for water and voiced out as to how rude the other attendee was to which she replied “it’s okay, it’s okay”, any parent with a hungry baby would know it’s not okay to see your child in tears. It was so hard to get a cup of water from these people I don’t know what they would do if a more urgent issue arised. My problems could have been taken care of at so many stages of the days events. They could have sent an email out informing us about the strike and that there would be no meals on board, at the check in counter, announced it, at the boarding gate, by the staff. I am a parent, I will always need to know that I can feed my child. If I had known at any of these stages that there weren’t any meals I would have requested to take a bottle of water with me. If you are a parent, my advice to you is to not use this airline or if you really have to then you have to take on the responsibility to keep checking with the staff for any issues which my hinder your journey, cause lord knows they won’t do it!

### "seats had been given away"
Sydney to Los Angeles via Nadi. Booked exit seats and paid online, got to counter they had been given away, mind you we were one of the first to book in. After 9 phone calls not understanding the Fijians and 6 weeks later finally got a refund. Food is terrible, seats uncomfortable. Go through all security checks in Sydney bags checked etc etc. Get to Nadi get off a plane and walk straight to security check go through my bag again where they claim you cant have a small roll on Deodorant has to be in a small plastic zip bag. Why is this? I have just carried it off a flight from Sydney its less than 30ml it is unopened. Of course I don't have a zip plastic bag so I have to give it to them they cant tell me why I cant take it. I'm on a 14 hour flight I should be able to stay fresh I have abided by the rules set in Sydney. Walk out and guess what I find in the lounge the same deodorant I asked them do I need to put this is in a bag to take on the plane girl looked at me odd. I would go with you get what you paid for, be prepared for the worse.

### "not be flying Fiji Airways again"
Nadi to Los Angeles. We paid for our two adult children to fly at the bulkhead seats and to have bassinets for their babies. When we get to the airport they changed the seats and gave them away both on the inbound and the outbound flights. We tried to work with them and showed them our confirmation of the seats and payment of the extra fee. They said that other people were confirmed and that our seats were only requested, even though we had a confirmation email. When we asked a supervisor they said that it was because there were three younger babies on the flight and they gave the seats to them. When we boarded the plane and saw that those "babies" were over 65 years old we knew two things. One, we feel they doublebooked those seats and stole our money and they lied to us about why our seats were given away. Very poor customer service. We have flown with them more than a dozen times and they always seem to change seats either on us or those we fly with. We only find out when we get to the ticket counter. I will not be flying with Fiji Airways again.

### "had to book a new ticket home"
Los Angeles to Sydney. Terrible customer service. We booked a flight from San Francisco to Sydney via Los Angeles. When we arrived in LA we were transferred straight to our gate to wait for our next flight to Sydney. When it was time to board we were told that Virgin America in San Francisco did not check us in through to Sydney so they could not let us board the flight. When we called the service team they were rude and not helpful. Our only option was to pay a fare difference and change fee of over $1000 to board the flight that was 24 hours away. And even if we wait for this flight we are not confirmed and may not be able to board. We called multiple times to try to work out what was going on with Fiji Airways service team and no one was able to help. I would not recommend flying with this airline as it was definitely not worth the hassle considering we had to book a new ticket  with another airline as it was cheaper than paying the many fees Fiji Airways wanted to charge.

### "a terrible attitude"
Nadi to San Francisco. On the check-in counter for my return flight, they inform me there is a problem with my ticket and they must change first for second name with the cost of 50$ . The guy at the Nadi check in counter blames me for buying on line (easyest and almost only way to buy it in Spain) with a terrible attitude (this was the first and only bad attitude I had in Fiji) says take it or cancel and stay here. Really bad to have nasty people solving passengers problems.

### "seat was comfortable"
Nadi to Auckland on July 3rd. It was my first time to fly with Fiji Airways. The check-in in Nadi was fast. The staff did Fijian welcome and said "Bula" to every passenger. The aircraft was Boeing 737-800. The seat was comfortable and had enough leg room. The meal onboard was good.

### "love the Fijian welcome"
Nadi to Auckland. I like the level of comfort in the aircraft and also I am very happy with the cabin crew.They way they serve their customer is fantastic and the way the cabin crew looks after the passengers in the cabin was good. I really love the Fijian welcome as you enter the main door of the cabin. I highly recommend this airline.

### "forgot my luggage"
Wellington to Nadi. The check-in in Wellington was fast and good. Boarding process chaotic. The seat was ok, but not much to do, only an airline magazine. Food was really good for this short flight. Fiji Airways forgot my luggage in Wellington, but after three days (and a bad facebook review) they brought the luggage to me. Fiji Airways only paid 100 Fiji Dollars. To get this money you have to walk through the departure terminal building, go one floor upstairs and look for the refund office.

### "A warm Fijian welcome"
Nadi to Singapore. This is my first long haul flight with Fiji Airways. The boarding process was smooth with the ground staff were calling for business class as the rest had already almost blocked the boarding lane. A warm Fijian welcome was waiting for us with drinks etc. The seat arrangements was 2-2-2 with a semi flat bed. The pillow was hard and the leather seat was fine. As I was seated in the front I had sufficient leg space. As it was a very full flight there were some passengers who were upgraded to business class. The crew were attentive and asking frequently the passengers on whether they need drinks etc, I did not eat on this overnight flight. However my bag was the last to arrive on the baggage claim with sand and my black bag looked brown.

### "isn't going to help you"
I made a booking with Fiji Airways online service on Tuesday 7/3 for my mum to travel from Fiji to Adelaide in April. Unfortunately I did a typing error in spelling my mums family name. I typed 's' instead of an 'a'. I called Fiji airways customer service on Thursday to get my error corrected. I was told they had to get approval from their coordinator and it would take 24hrs. 5 days and 120hrs later I call customer service only to be told they can only change the name on their flight. And because there was a connecting flight through Jetstar airways I had to call them myself and get the name change done. I just can't understand why provide a service when you can't deal with simple issues as such. Customer service is so pathetic am still waiting for a call back. Surprisingly their email system gets down as well so things cannot happen. Just warning other customers please triple check your booking as if things go wrong Fiji airways isn't going to help you at all. I feel embarrassed to write this review for my very own national carrier.

### "high quality standards"
Nadi to Singapore with Fiji Airways. Excellent airline: aircraft very clean, staff very friendly, efficient and helpful, on time. It's the exoticism and friendliness of the Fijian population coupled with high quality standards. The direct flight from Singapore to Fiji/Nadi is making the trip easy. All this is definitely an incentive to go to Fiji again soon.

### "would recommend Fiji Airways"
❎ Unverified |  Brisbane to Nadi on a Boeing 737. Pleasant short-haul flight on Fiji Airways which was simple but comfortable. The lunch service provided was quite tasty and plentiful with two choices of meals. No in-flight entertainment offered, adequate for a shorter flight. Flight attendants were friendly and kind, greeting passengers with a Fijian welcome upon boarding. Aircraft was clean and there are some Fijian decorations on board. I also flew Nadi to Taveuni Island return on a Fiji Link Twin Otter aircraft which was a very short and basic domestic flight. I did get charged a small amount extra for over-sized baggage on the return domestic flight at Taveuni Airport, so be careful as they are tight on baggage restrictions. Would recommend and fly with Fiji Airways again.

### "Nadi airport was very basic"
Singapore to Auckland via Nadi. Our flight from Singapore at 1055 was rescheduled to 1400 but we were not informed. We arrived at the airport at 0930 and found out the new timing, only to wait there for 5 hours. The flight from Nadi to Auckland delayed also from 0945 to 1300. Nadi airport was very basic and noisy. It was terrible to spend 8 hours there although we were given food coupon. Because of the delay, we collected our rental car after 6pm so we had to pay late charge of NZD 60. Fiji Airways didn't want to refund us and just offered discount for the next ticket which I was not interested in. Fiji Airways customer service is the worst I've ever seen. The positive side is the aircraft looks new and very clean.

### "flight was the best ever"
Sydney to Los Angeles via Nadi. Flight was delayed due to a problem with aircraft. They compensated on the stopover by putting us up in a nice hotel, room service meals included. The flight from Nadi to Los Angeles was the best ever, I was asked if I wanted a 4 seat row to myself when I already had a 3 seat to myself. Best sleep ever on a plane. Very happy with the level of service!

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Not perfect but better than expected. Having flown quite a bit around the Pacific, most of which does not warrant a good rating, I was pleasantly surprised by the latest offering from Fiji Airways. The plane was newish, the flight crew were friendly and the seat, for a relatively short haul international flight, was pretty much as good as you get (lay flat, power and widgets etc.). The IES was a tad lacking but this is only a one film flight so there was just about enough. And by the time you read this most of the renovations at Nadi airport should have been completed so you wont have to experience the rather dismal business class lounge. Going the right way.

### "need to be more efficient"
Nadi to Los Angeles. The onboard crew need to be more efficient to customers. Waiting 15 mins to get a glass of water is ridiculous. The special meal request was accepted by the airline but no special meal was offered, when asked I was told they don't have my request. I will avoid using Fiji Airways, not worth it for such a long flight.

### "service was friendly and efficient"
Sydney to Los Angeles with a stopover in Nadi. Check in was easy with no waiting, aircraft left a few minutes late due to normal Sydney delays. Nadi is nearing a make over and no doubt the new lounge will be superior to the old one which is still usable. Flight from Nadi left on time, I slept most of the way to LAX and the plane landed ahead of time. Food offered was of a good standard and the service was friendly and efficient. The stop in Nadi does break up the flight and the new look airport will be a big boost. A good flight all over, the IFE is limited however there where decent choices.

### "inconsistency of service"
Los Angeles to Nadi. There is still a lot of work to be done by this airline, but don't get me wrong it is my favorite airline and will always be my choice of airline. I am still disappointed with the inconsistency of service, and on this flight some cabin crew just do not live up to the mark. When boarding started one of the cabin crew was standing at the entrance barking at passengers to have their boarding pass ready to show, the other cabin crew welcomed everyone on board with a smile. During the flight the same cabin crew woke me up rudely to serve my dinner. I asked for a vegetarian meal on this flight from Los Angeles which was just steamed veggies with rice. Apart from two crew, all the rest were wonderful, smiling and making their rounds of the cabin. The ground staff at LA were more friendly and efficient compared to the staff at Nadi.

### "crew was friendly, welcoming"
Nadi to Melbourne. Fiji Airways was a pleasure to fly with, the crew was friendly, welcoming and made us feel like we were at home. As it was only a short flight we had one meal, which was okay for aeroplane food. Cabin was clean, and the flight was smooth. They have inflight entertainment on the Boeing 737 - although not state of the art, it was drop screens every three rows, but it would keep your kids occupied. Would definitely recommend Fiji Airways.

### "crew super-friendly, always smiling"
Nadi to Los Angeles. I checked in on-line and it was super easy, the flight was only 3/4 full and the seat next to me was empty for this 11-hour flight. I get to the airport for baggage drop - I don't see the purpose of having that because the girl serving the counter was really slow, the business class line had been cleared and I dropped my bags there, and by the time I was done the girl at the baggage drop was still serving the same people as she was when I came in. The flight was delayed in boarding because their system was out, they then did boarding manually, but even then we managed to pick up speed and arrived on time. The cabin crew were once again the highlight of the experience, super-friendly, always smiling and making rounds of the cabin with drinks and water. Quite frankly the only reason I fly Fiji Airways is for the cabin crew, the ground staff have a lot to learn from them. The deboarding was delayed because there were issues with the aerobridge.

### "more like a budget airline"
On the outward leg to Fiji we had selected our seats over 4 months prior, and the selected seats were confirmed during online checkin, and again when we did the bag drop on date of travel. When we reached the boarding gate we were advised that due to safety reasons and load balancing we had been re-allocated seats from row 16 to row 36. It transpires that someone else was allocated our original seats, making a joke of the reason given. The website suggests that inflight entertainment offers a range of movies and other media, but in reality economy passengers get to watch a movie on overhead screens serving two rows of seats. So 70's style entertainment. If you want a wine with your meal, you have to pay for it, as your choices are juice, coffee or water. For a front line airline, they act more like a budget airline.

### "way she handled it was marvellous"
Nadi to Suva. I fly domestically a lot and don't usually feel the need to post reviews, but I just had to with this one. So when I got to the airport I saw a lady  dressed in Fiji Link's cabin crew uniform. At first thought, I said to myself "How could she be a cabin crew, and what could she possibly have to offer" but I was wrong. I was seated in Row 1 which means I board first and from the first to the last passenger, she did a head count and found 10 passengers to be missing, now here is where she won me. She went out, leaving the Junior Cabin Crew on board with the passengers, and looked for the 10 passengers who were still clearing immigration after arriving late from LAX. First and foremost, it was a very rare sighting, I have never seen a flight attendant go out of his/her way to look for passengers so they don't miss their flight. I was a little annoyed with the 30 minutes delay, but the way she handled it was marvelous, once she came in and closed the doors and went over the PA "Ladies and gentleman I sincerely thank you for your patience" yes that's right she thanked us, instead of generically apologising, at that moment all my annoyance was gone. . Even while disembarking she treated everyone with respect.

### "seats were rock hard"
Melbourne to Nadi with Fiji Airways. My first time to Fiji and my first flight with Fiji Airways. Although it won't be my last visit to Fiji, I think I may consider other options for flights to get there. I wouldn't say they were terrible but there were a few things that have affected my decision. Firstly, the flights to Nadi from Melbourne only depart late evening and arrive early morning in Nadi so it's often hard to find accommodation or hotels that will accept such an early arrival. Secondly, the 737-800 is woefully too small of an aircraft to be flying such a route. Thirdly, the food was very ordinary to say the least, a choice of vegetarian or chicken on noodles which was a miniscule piece of chicken on average noodles. I didn't eat on the return flight as I knew what was coming and couldn't stomach it. The inflight service was OK, on the way there, one male FA was a little passive aggressive but they were friendly and smiling on the return flight. Seats were rock hard, I had back pain and could not get comfortable on the return flight. I think I might take the option of Virgin next time I visit Fiji unless Fiji Airways improve their service in the future.

### "have a machine checking us in"
Flew Brisbane to Nadi with Fiji Airways. Let's make this evaluation in two rounds: First: check in/ground services provided: weak. If you consider that Fiji is hiring a lady to welcome and greet you for check in, she could not be more apathetic. I'd rather suggest Fiji to have a machine checking us in instead. Secondly: a very old aircraft. However, lunch, drinks and service were the highest point aboard.

### "service standards were very good"
Sydney to Nadi and return with Fiji Airways. We traveled with 3 adults and 3 kids. I thought the service standards were very good. They were a little disorganized around boarding but the experience was otherwise great. The staff were friendly. We got the larger A330 over which was better than the B737-800 that we came back on due to the back of seat entertainment in the Airbus.

### "supervisor was unhelpful"
On June 24th I was booked on the first flight from Nadi to Labasa via Nausori international airport. The check in was supposed to open at 4.30am, we get to the airport around 4.45am and no one shows up till 5am for a flight that was scheduled to leave at 6.00am. Once at the check-in, instead of checking us right through to Labasa the agent only checked us to Suva's airport only. Upon insisting that we only have a 30 minute transit time which contradicts with their check-in policy which states check-in closes 30 minutes prior departure. The same plane from Nadi to Suva goes from Suva to Labasa. On asking for a reason she said "oh don't worry you have ample time" so I chose not to argue any further. Fast forward to Nausori, once we get there we collect our bags with 15 minutes to departure and boarding call made. Once we get to the Nausori the staff were unhelpful and said "the flight is full go on the 10am one" I obviously said "you can't tell me that because we are booked on that flight and our seat should be there". The supervisor was unhelpful, and she walked inside and came out after 10 minutes and then checked us for the flight. This  caused a delay of 20 minutes of the next flight. Upon complaining to the airline they took so much time in responding I chose to go and confront the check in agent myself and she was giving me lame excuses. The only reason this airline is getting even a 5 from is because the inflight staff were very friendly, and the check-in agents on my return were helpful and friendly. The flight attendant on the return leg from Suva to Nadi is the best FA I have ever come across.

### "double paid for return flight "
Five of us flew to Christchurch from LAX. On the return from Christchurch, Fiji Airways canceled my daughter-in-law's return ticket because she and my daughter had the same first and last name. Even though all five of us flew out to Christchurch together on the same itinerary! They refused to let daughter-in-law board the flight unless we purchased a one-way ticket for her. The ticket agent promised that Fiji Airways would refund it since it was their mistake. After 10 phone calls and multiple emails, Fiji Airways refused. So we double paid for the return flight because of their mistake.

### "seats were comfortable"
Singapore to Nadi with Fiji Airways. Service excellent and cabin crew were friendly, attentive and approachable. They ensured customers feel at home. During the flight numerous checks, offering water / juice to passengers. Seats were comfortable. Ample legroom for a 5'9 guy. Inflight entertainment would be my only gripe. I exhausted the list of movies pretty quickly during my flight. Food is comprehensive and sufficient. Wide selection (3 choices) and they were tasty.

### "the service was poor"
Absolutely disgraceful experience. We were travelling Fiji Airways from Nadi to Sydney at the end of our holiday and waited two hours, we reach the front of the line (people still checking in adjacent counters), and get told after a bit of back and forth that the aircraft is overbooked! So they attempt to free seats by upgrading other passengers and after a bit more magic - zero seats on the plane. Their excuse? Sorry, we thought people wouldn't show up. Seriously? The next flight wasn't for another 10 hours, naturally at this point we're a little annoyed (as well as probably another ten passengers who had the similar misfortune.). But, they say they'll give us a hotel and lunch to compensate. They just need 'twenty minutes' to sort it out. Three hours later (with near zero communication) and with no small part of hassling from our part, we finally get a shuttle to the hotel. I'm still not convinced that anything would've happened if we didn't keep asking them every 30 minutes. The only other passengers who came with us were the two who kept asking - I don't know if the other six got any sort of accommodation or food to compensate. When we came back for our priority check in flight - we saw another eight or so people getting the same story we got told "We've overbooked, sorry. We didn't think people would show up". I wouldn't recommend this airline to anyone. The service was poor, and you have to hassle them to get anything done. The inflight food was poor, and inflight entertainment was non-existent. The whole experience just about soured our holiday.

### "the service is slow"
Indifference is how I would describe my experience. I had a full fare business class ticket flying from Sydney to Nadi on the Qantas code share. You can't check in at Qantas even with a Qantas flight number and at the Fiji Air check-in no one was at the business class check-in although there was someone at the service desk next to it but she just ignored the business class line. After 15 minutes of no action I asked her if we were wasting our time in the business class line and she said we should get on the economy line. So you pay this extra money and get nothing? Onboard and generally the staff are friendly but the service is slow, almost an hour into the flight before drinks are offered. The A330 is definitely better than the 737 but most flights are on the 737 in which case I prefer Virgin for service at least in business, the downside is Virgin offers no lounge in Nadi. Qantas should think twice about putting its name to this service because I expect a certain standard when I buy Qantas and you don't get it on Fiji Airways.

### "the experience was not positive"
Although Fiji Airways got us to and from our destination in Samoa recently, I note the following deficits in the service provided by the airline. Seating on the long flight from LAX to Nadi, Fiji was very limited. The nearly 11 hour flight was cramped at best. Carry-on baggage restrictions are very strict with a maximum of 7 kg allowed in carry-on. Numerous passengers, including us, had to take items from their carry-on baggage and place them in their checked baggage. This seemed odd in that the total weight of all baggage taken did not change. Company policy varied by airport. For example, the airport in LAX refused to tag my wife's carry-on bag because, they said, it was oversize. She was, however, allowed to take it as a carry-on. (The attendant seemed to be very afraid of consequence with management.) On our return trip, my wife's carry-on bag was not questioned, but mine was. Also, an umbrella my wife was carrying was allowed to be sent as an item of checked baggage in Apia, but when we arrived in Nadi, they refused to allow her to take the umbrella either as a carry-on or as a checked item unless she was willing to pay $200 to have it checked. The hassle was unnecessary and the result of lack of uniform policies with the airline. I appreciated being able to arrive safely and return from our destination, but the experience with Fiji Airlines was not positive. They need to get their act together and apply uniform procedures at all airports and properly advise customers of their policies, especially the restrictive weight allowance with carry-ons.

### "good legroom, comfortable seats"
Flew with Fiji Airways back home a few days later and I noticed few differences from my Tuesday morning flight. The check in agent was friendly and very efficient. The airport staff at Luvuluvu airport are friendlier than the guys at Nadi. The product in-flight was still the same a newspaper, bottle of water, and refresher towel. Turbulent flight, but still quick, was the last flight. Good legroom, comfortable seats, looking forward to flying with them again.

### "legroom is surprisingly good"
It has been a long while that I have used Fiji Airways domestic service. From my previous experiences though it has been not so pleasant due to the delays. This time around though, the flight was on time, the check in was very efficient - be warned though that sometimes the flight may leave earlier. At the time of buying the ticket for Flight FJ7 I was told the flight will depart Nadi at 6.45am, but at the airport the same flight was scheduled for 6.30am. The product has improved as well, for a 20 minutes flight obviously you can not expect food, but you get a bottle of water, newspaper and refresher towels which I guess is reasonable. The legroom on the ATR is surprisingly good, I am over 6feet tall and it still had some space to spare.

### "an exceptional flight"
Checked in at Nadi Airport, waited for flight, through boarding gate and heard a beep sound. Offered an Upgrade into Business Class, so why not accept it. Pleasant surprise. Very comfortable seating, very friendly and outgoing cabin crew. Preflight drinks, and more than one were offered, personal introduction by cabin attendant and set for takeoff. Superb inflight service, breakfast was great, not like some airlines where breakfast is inedible. In flight entertainment system had plenty of choices. Seat turned into angled flat bed, very comfortable, even with my height. Overall, an exceptional flight, service and offerings on Fiji Airways and very very happy with the product.

### "really quite satisfied"
Auckland to Nadi return with Fiji Airways. Check in at Auckland Airport was efficient and friendly. Allocated seat in economy cabin was fine and ample leg space to boot. First impression of cabin crew were that they were tired, but they still smiled away and undertook their duties as and when required. Lunch service was prompt, drinks service also prompt, even a second round offered to this pax. Cannot understand why the lunch trays could only be collected so late in the flight, seems to be the norm on Fiji Airways, serve the meal and drinks and then leave it for some time to come back and take the trays away. For a short 3 hour flight, really quite satisfied with the price we paid, the service offered and comfort level of seating. Flight was full. not am empty seat in sight, so they must be doing something right, despite negative comments from previous reviewers.

### "not one smile"
Flew Fiji Airways from Nadi to Melbourne. The flight itself was comfortable. The care by staff was another story, terrible would be an understatement. Not one smile by the attendants. Gave a duty free order promptly which was ignored. Food tray left on lap for 2 hours. Passenger had a small child that was sick and help button pressed which was ignored so friend had to run down to the back of plane to get help but came back without it until a few minutes later. A bottle of water and a cup was all that was offered. No attempt made to help except to say might have to get border control in. Poor woman was trying to clean up and help upset child. The staff came up the aisle so infrequently we didn't know who they were. Really upset me this flight as most of the Fijian people are helpful and obliging.

### "lot better than I expected"
Sydney to Nadi in Fiji Airways business class. Only problem I had is that I booked Qantas ticket QF391 paid Qantas and as a gold Air Berlin (sapphire oneworld) I tried to get into the Qantas lounge, I could but I could not take my partner as they would not except my Air Berlin  as I was not travelling on Qantas aircraft - the lady at Qantas lounge even said that I do not earn status credit or miles flying Fiji Airways. I had to correct her and show her the Qantas FF page. Very sad that Qantas lounge staff don't know about their own loyalty program. I was very concerned about my upcoming flight on Fiji Airways due to bad reviews. I found the airline fine, not fancy, but they are trying and seams from previous reviews that it is improving slowly. Boarding was easy business was before children they way it should be. The crew were friendly, warm welcome at the door and nice pre departure cocktail. When I purchased the ticket on Qantas web page it was for the Airbus but when I arrived at the gate I noticed it was the Boeing 737. Big difference in product but seat was still comfortable, cocktails were served about 50min after take off - a nice range of red and white wines and spirits. Lunch was a nice spicy chicken, vegetable and rice. It was very spicy and for the first time I have eaten the entire meal on a plane. Of course I had another scotch. The flight attendants were very attentive coming around refilling drinks until 30 min before landing. Overall not a bad flight, a lot better than I expected and I would do it again Would like to try the Airbus product.

### "I had a pleasant flight"
I have flown Fiji Airways many times and though a bit costly but worth it. I flew Nadi to Hong Kong, and I must say I had a pleasant flight. The seat was comfortable, the IFE was well up to date, and the food was nice and filling. The check in was very efficient given it was a morning flight when most of Fiji Airways flights leave one after the other they still managed to check us in pretty efficiently. We cannot blame the airline if some passengers choose to shuffle their luggage at the airport because some did not read the baggage allowance clearly.

### "bad experience with baggage"
We flew from Sudney to Los Angeles on Fiji Airways. The overall service was okay, however we had a bad experience with their carry on baggage demands. Before we flew, I had contacted Fiji Airways and specifically asked about their baggage policies. We measured our carry on bags and they were within their limits. We were told an oversized piece would be 100AUD. On checking in at Sydney they claimed my wife's bag was oversized. It fitted into the metal bin with two wheels hanging on the lip by 1/4 inch. They were adamant it was oversized, told us we would have to pay the fee to receive boarding passes and then charged 120AUD to add insult to injury. The bag met their weight and size requirement. We filed a complaint with American Express who refunded our fee. Fiji also made me count a medically necessary device as a carry on item. Fiji Airways forced us to pay unwarranted charges, were rude and refused to let us board until their fees were paid. We will never fly with this airline again.

### "product could be improved"
Los Angeles to Christchurch via Nadi with Fiji Airways. The people couldn't be nicer, but the product could be improved. The food wasn't very good on the outbound. Breakfast was served on a noon flight from Fiji to New Zealand - it should have been lunch. The inflight entertainment was very limited, and the angle seats were not flat. The pillow was the worst I've ever had in business class.

### "cabin crew friendly and helpful"
Our flight from Auckland to Los Angeles via Nadi (and back) with Fiji Airways was great - we didn't encounter any problems with checking in and getting our luggage and both flights was smooth. The food was not so bad. The seating is a little cramped but it wasn't like I was onboard for long. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful. I would definitely fly with them again.

### "food was awful"
The crew on the flight from Los Angeles  to Nadi (12/22/15) were very friendly, however on our return flight I don't think I saw one smile. Perhaps this late evening flight is a bit tiring on the attendants. The food was awful, and by the time the meals arrived to our area, there never seemed to be any vegetarian meals available. The entertainment options were okay.

### "carry on didn't fit the basket"
After arriving to Nadi from Los Angeles and I had a connecting flight to Labasa. After checking at the counter, I was told to place my carry on in a basket to check the size. When my carry on didn't fit the basket I was told to pay $90. I explained that I have a connecting flight from LAX and this particular carry on was good and met the cabin size she refused to listen to me and demanded that I pay the said amount.

### "got a bit of rest anyway"
Los Angeles to Nadi with Fiji Airways. Great check at LAX. We flew AA from SAV-CLT-LAX and had our bags checked all the way through to Nadi. Had to get boarding passes in LAX where they also check cabin baggage for both weight and size. Flying business class allowed us one more carry on. The lounge is not so great but did not spend a lot of time in there anyway. Boarding was good and was offered a drink as we got settled in. The flight leaves LAX late but dinner was served almost immediately after reaching cruising altitude. Good food and wine. Got about 7 hours of sleep before being awakened about 2 hours out of Nadi for breakfast. The seats are not lie-flat but got a bit of rest anyway. Deplaning and transiting customs was a breeze and we were on our way to our hotel in no time. The return flight was about the same.

### "really enjoyed my experience"
Flew out of Los Angeles to Sydney via Nadi. Very nice aircraft, helpful and friendly cabin crew.The food was adequate and very refreshing. Then flew out of Melbourne for Fiji on 11th November. Once again I found the service to be a great one. Good service and friendly crew. The flight from Fiji to Los Angeles on November 14th was okay. I really enjoyed my experience on the Fiji Airways.

### "staff very welcoming"
Fiji Airways from Los Angeles to Nadi and then travelling to Labasa the staff very welcoming and helpful. Travel back to Suva lots of generosity. Stayed in Fiji at Grand Pacific. At Nadi Airport the ground crew well trained customer service representative. Onboard flights the Fiji Airways crew were very friendly and good timing on food.

### "much better than the last"
My return Fiji Airways flight from Los Angeles to Nadi was much better than the last. The inflight entertainment had improved and there were more movies, even Chinese ones. Except the Hindi songs, there is a need for new songs not from movies which released years ago. The food was good, chicken curry was delicious and filling for the 11 hours flight ahead. Looking forward to flying Fiji Airways in future again.

### "couldn't care less approach"
Fiji Airways couldn't care less approach to travelers on its Nadi to Honolulu route. The airline chose to dump its passengers in a closed airport at 1.50 am. There was no food or beverage service and passengers continuing on to the other islands have at least a 5 hour wait, sitting on concrete flower planters. On the return flight had to wait 7 hours from the last inter island flight for departure scheduled for 2.50 am, which seldom leaves on time. The seating on the plane is so old that the foam that was originally used is now so compressed that it gives no back support. If you were lucky enough to get an exit row seat, in the past, it would give you a reasonable amount of leg room for someone 1.88 mtr, or 6ft 2ins tall. Now Fiji Airways is penalising passengers by charging $99.00 for this comfort. Though the company promotes the Fiji International Golf Tournament it will charge you $440.00 to take your golf bag with you even if it weighs the same as a regular bag, 23 kilos or 50lbs. Try getting your frequent flyer miles credited in a timely manner. Impossible. I flew on October 4th and am still waiting. That happens 90% of the time. Contacting Customer Care is a waste of time. They will tell you they will respond within 21 days. 21 days to respond is unbelievable, but they never do. The sad thing is that if you need to go from Nadi to Honolulu you have no choice as Fiji Airways has a monopoly on this route and they treat it as such.

### "economy class was comfortable"
After rebranding this was my first flight with Fiji Airways, and it was one of the best flight experiences ever, the meal service was excellent, flight was on time, and the economy class was comfortable for a long haul flight of such. Entertainment needs to be worked on, some latest hindi music would be great, I spent my 10 hours watching the GPS, so you can imagine how bad the other options were. Flight attendants were friendly, young and competent people on the plane. The check in was really slow, t the immigration process at LAX is faster than this.

### "we had been misinformed"
We decide to travel to Fiji for a holiday. On our way to back to Sydney we were to fly via Nadi from Suva. We had spend most our holiday in Suva while checking-in for our flight to Sydney which was via Nadi we were told by Fiji Airways that we will have to recheck ourselves again at Nadi for the Sydney flight. We were very disappointed to come to know about this? We were told well in advance prior to making our booking and while paying for the trip that we will not have to recheck ourselves at Nadi and will receive our bags in Sydney. The customer service staff said that we had been misinformed which was very disappointing and after my husband and i explained to them that this was our first trip to Fiji and we had big bags and we would appreciated it if they can check to see if it was a mistake of some sort. Fiji Airways customer Service said they couldn't do anything and were rude in their approach towards us. We were really disappointed and did not want any drama so we asked them if they can put us on a later connecting flight and were disappointed to know that there was no another flight late in the evening so sad and very disappointing since our connecting flight was 7 hours earlier.

### "return flight was awful"
We have just flown Sydney to Nadi return with Fiji Airways. The flight over was okay, though the service wasn't great as meal service was slow and the food was really poor. Fine for 3.5 hour flight. Return flight was awful however, as we were on a smaller plane (the type usually used for domestic travel). It had only one aisle, so trying to get to the toilets was a nightmare. The toilets were filthy when we did get there. The food was again really terrible - bland chicken and pasta, no bread roll - just a weird cabbage and corn salad. My 7 year old son refused to eat any of it and was hungry for the rest of the trip. No snacks available. The seats were small and uncomfortable, there was no inflight entertainment other than shared screen playing "just for laughs" a gag comedy show. No flight map. The trip took almost 5 hours. Will not fly Fiji Airways again- would rather go with low cost provider, because at least you know what you're getting! This airline needs to lift its game.

### "food served was absolutely atrocious"
Flew Fiji Airways from Auckland to Nadi return on Boeing 737-800. This aircraft is 16 years old but the cabin is in good order. Entertainment via fixed screens, very 1990's. Aircraft need a refit with modern seatback IFE. The onboard service was patchy, and only half the cabin got served water. The food served was absolutely atrocious. Fiji Airways needs to sort the food and entertainment issues urgently. Other than that flights were on time.

### Fiji Airways customer review
This was my first time experience flying on Fiji Airways from SYD-NAD. The welcome from the flight crew was warm and their smile and traditional greetings of "Bula" were very welcoming. The almost flat seats were comfortable with a pillow and blanket. Welcome drinks limited to juice and cocktails. When I asked for water, they simply indicated that the bottle of water is there, no glass was offered like other airlines. Meals were palatable and traditional curried Fijian fish was served. Once meals were cleared, no other drink rounds were offered but available when I asked. The IFE system had about 12-15 movies, 5-6 TV shows and the flight map. The choices were somewhat limited but okay for a short flight of 4 hours. I travelled with two senior family members, one of which required wheel chair assistance, and the service on arrival to Na'di Airport was great and the ground crew went out their way to also assist us locate our luggage. The attendant waited patiently whilst we cleared immigration and customs. They also ensured that we got onto the taxi heading to the our final destination in Na'di safely. Fiji Airways surpassed my expectation and will fly with them again in Business class. I feel that it is a safe and reliable airline.

### Fiji Airways customer review
My wife and I had the great misfortune to have booked to fly from Auckland to Nadi on 29th May 2015 with Fiji Airways. The flight was scheduled to depart at 12.55, but about half way through the check-in, the gate was closed. Apparently Fiji Airways were a plane down due to an accident two weeks earlier. They had downgraded the flight and half of the passengers (including us) had to wait for 9 hours, while the aircraft transported the lucky passengers and returned for us. This meant that we did not arrive at our hotel until 3.30. In my view, they failed to advise us of the situation to avoid cancellations. Clearly, they put profit before the interests of their passengers. We complained on our return to NZ, and received an acknowledgement stating that they would respond within 60 days (not great customer service in my book). We will never fly with them again.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Lacks everything. Paid for a flatbed, got a broken seat. Unfortunately, business class was full, so I was stuck with my seat. On checking in, we were advised we could use the Tabua club as they didn't have a business class lounge - we went to the club, and were turned away as our names "were not on her list". Soon found an airport cafe to eat dinner in (flight was delayed 3 hours). Staff welcomed us aboard, swiftly brought drinks and settled people in. Food was mediocre, nothing like I remember Air Pacific before they rebranded. Entertainment with very few movies to chose from, but that didn't bother me, as it was a night flight, and I wanted to sleep. Since we have flown, I have emailed Fiji Airways, and they can't be bothered responding. Says it all about customer service really.

### Fiji Airways customer review
My family and I flew to Fiji, SYD-NAN in July on an Airbus A330 (DQ-FJU). The aircraft decor was very pleasant, the crew were friendly and helpful and the food on board was nice. For a 4 hour flight, the aircraft was comfortable enough, but the seats are nowhere near as comfortable as those on a Qantas aircraft. The entertainment selection was quite limited also. I will most likely choose to fly with them next time we go to Fiji, but I would not travel on longer flights to Los Angeles or Hong Kong on Fiji Airways. I'd like to also point out to people connecting to the US on Fiji Airways, any drinks or duty free alcohol in your hand luggage brought from your origin will be taken off you.

### Fiji Airways customer review
On 11 April I flew FJ 391 from NAN to HKG. The flight was full and the aircraft was clean. The food was good. However my only comment is about cleanliness of the wash rooms. Every time I went to use it I had to clean and wipe the wash room and the surrounding areas with a paper towels because the previous customers had left the toilet in a filthy and disgusting state. The same situation had occurred to me on a different flight from HKG to LHR I had to perform similar task because the state of the dirty wash rooms. I am now wondering whether a written sign may be placed in the wash rooms to inform other users about the basic standard and cleanliness of wash room facilities for the other customers to use. I am sick of cleaning other peoples' mess.

### Fiji Airways customer review
I flew flight NZ4010 taking off from Nadi 21.40 24th March 2015 to Los Angeles landing 13.25 the day after. An overnight flight. I had several young children around me during that time 3 of which were upset screaming and crying for a lot of the time. I asked a female member of the aircrew if I could have a mask and earplugs in order to try to sleep. All she did was to shrug her shoulders and say they were not available she didn't look interested couldn't have cared less and did nothing to help. Absolutely shocking.

### Fiji Airways customer review
LAX-Nadi / Nadi-LAX. 787 seats are poor-too narrow and uncomfortable for such a long flight. Cabin Staff OK but not particularly friendly particularly in comparison with local Fijians. Once food and Beverage service is completed they disappear. Main gripe is the food- simply nowhere near good enough in this competitive market. FA really need to improve the F&B offering. Whoever suggested that breakfast should comprise a so-called omelette with all the flavour and consistency of Styrofoam accompanied by curried carrots?

### Fiji Airways customer review
Fiji airways inflight services is very poor flying from Nadi to Melbourne the aircraft was really old the only entertain on the flight was the movie showing on main stream screen there was no alternative inflight entertainment such as back seat personal television or iPad which majority airliners provide these days. I have flow several budget airliners and full service airliners and they offer more meal choices and variety inflight entertainment. The meal service was so poor food was intended for people who are on diet. I have flown on their Sydney to Nadi route and the same situation their domestic connections are so disorganized and have very poor lay over and connection times if you are unable to make it from one connection to the other then you will be very disappointed. The 737 aircraft's that they use are so old if you are a frequent traveler and have been travelling for years you will be able to tell difference.

### Fiji Airways customer review
FJ916 on 14 December SYD-NAN: Absolute poor and rude customer service provided at check-in in SYD. Stressed and not properly trained staff. Flight was ok although staff were very inexperienced. Most unprofessional airline I have encountered.

### Fiji Airways customer review
We flew to and from New Zealand on Dec 10 and Jan 16 on Fiji Airways. Service was competent food was palatable. We had excellent and friendly service in Auckland. The planes were reasonably comfortable especially if you got the two seats by the window. Flight attendants were friendly and as attentive as possible. Our sole problem was at the transit lounge in Fiji. While I'm assuming it's a temporary arrangement during construction it is cold depressing and a hard place to spend several hours. In addition the many repeat security searches seemed like overkill since we got off a Fiji plane were trapped in the concrete dungeon and then got on a Fji plane. Also a flight attendant on the plane from Auckland gave me a bottle of water as I de-planed which a security guard took away as we boarded our flight for LAX. Many people had bought water which was taken from them. This seems like a scam or at best a bad policy - passengers need to be warned if their drinks will be taken from them. There is plenty of room in the large dank lounge for signs to that effect. Would I fly Fiji again? Yes the flights were fine although I'd try to get a direct flight or a very short transit layover.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Flew SYD-Nadi-LAX on 12 Jan plane delayed by 8 hours out of Sydney meal vouchers supplied and good announcements made. I think everyone but myself was given direct flights with other airlines if travelling to LAX however I spent the day and night in the Qantas lounge. Plane was the 330 and food and FA quite good movie selection was small however was only 3.5 hour flight. A booking error in Fiji was sorted by a very helpful fellow in the lounge and the trip to LA was good. Seats are good although they are not fully vertical so I slept for several hours. Movies where up to about 12 however no real block busters. Overall apart from the delays the actual flight was good and the staff where all very friendly and helpful.

### Fiji Airways customer review
My experience with Fiji Airways across 4 flights in 2012-2014: 1) Food is below average my vegan meal had snacks with egg in it and staff came to argue that I ordered incorrectly only to find out later that it was their error. 2) Juice is served like ration you get one at the start and one at the end. Lucky if they have some 'spares. 3) The alert button to call staff works fine but staff snooze off at the back after putting passengers to sleep. On 2 flights people were beeping for 30-45 minutes and no one showed up. Fiji Airways staff took their own time to help. 4) Once when boarding a flight 0 crew were inside the plane to help with directions and luggage. Crew entered 15 minutes after everyone sat down.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Fiji Airlines changed our lay over in Los Angles (returning from New Zealand) from several hours to two days. We found this out only after confirming our flight in Fiji. Nadi airport in Fiji was depressing with two restaurants with poor food.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Flew Sydney to LAX via Nadi in Business. The A330 was very nice. Food and drinks very good (better Gin than Qantas business class!) All four flights were on time. The arrival time into LAX was in the afternoon. I liked this more than early in the day. Evening flight was also good coming home. No jetlag either way! Would choose again.

### Fiji Airways customer review
I was somewhat nervous flying with this airline because of many bad reviews. However I had a good experience with them flying AKL-NAD NAD-LAX and return. There was a delay on the NAD-LAX flight of approx. an hour but I still had ample time to make my onward connection. My other flights were on time or even early. One thing that might have caught some people out was an earlier than normal check-in time for LAX-NAD (5pm for a 9.30pm flight) although this was sign-posted at the airport in the early afternoon. Boarding commenced an hour prior to take-off presumably because of a full flight. The inflight service was fine on all legs. The attendants were friendly and attentive. Food ranged from just average to good the better meals were on the return leg of the journey. The downside of this route to LAX is the long layovers. Not much to do in Fiji's transit lounge.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Used Fiji Airways as it was part of package - never again. SYD to NAN on 737 was ok food below average cabin crew would never get a job in one of the Fiji resorts. Return flight NAN to SYD - 15 minutes prior to boarding they announced that due to fuel/weather conditions 50 bags have been removed from the plane. This left the whole passenger list wondering if they were affected. On arrival at Sydney only 1 of my 4 bags made it home. Only 1 person left to deal with this mess and she was from a handling agent no direct rep from Fiji airways present. I will never fly Fiji Airways again by choice.

### Fiji Airways customer review
We were booked to fly on October 15 at 6.30am to Fiji. When we arrived to check in at Sydney airport at 5.00am we learned the flight was cancelled and a replacement could not be arranged for 12 hours. The excuse given was bad weather in Sydney the night before. We were to leave on the 19th October and had paid extra to book seats etc and when we arrive to check in at 07.30 for our 09.00 flight we were told the flight was oversold and that there were no seats available. About 8 other passengers were told the same thing. The Fiji representative refused to meet us and sent messages via the check in staff who are not employees of the airline. Virgin Australia came to our rescue.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Was very disappointed from the start. Was sent a text at 2.20pm stating flight changed to 5.45 the next morning. As I was on my way from Brisbane to Melbourne to catch this flight I had to find somewhere to stay for the night. The flight was then delayed again till 6.30am. The service is nothing great. But sitting watching a movie in a small screen above the seats 3 row in front is disappointing. On the trip back my seat did not recline. On the upside the food was beautiful. I will not be travelling with Fifi Airways again.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Economy from BNE-NAN then Biz NAN-LAX. Fly with Fiji alot and are very rarely disappointed. Both flights were good and the tidy up with the lounge in NAN has improved it as well. Flew home Biz with Qantas and their food was nowhere near as good as Fiji's. We have never had a problem with any of the cabin staff. Will be using them again in February and look forward to it.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Sydney - Nadi outbound Aug 14 return Sept 14. Very happy with both flights. Departed on time and both arrived slightly early. Outbound was A330 inbound 737. Both planes clean and efficient. Service was fine friendly but not in-your-face (others may see this as distant). Food was fine - pasta with chicken coleslaw and a cake I was happy with it. A330 is the new plane with in-seat screens for entertainment and a 2-4-2 config. Entertainment selection was fine - a few movies and TV shows and decent range of music. Kids' programs unavailable on our flight (unfortunately). 737 has overhead screens with single film offering (not suitable for under 10s). Price comparable to Virgin's no-frills offering service was far better.

### Fiji Airways customer review
We flew SYD-NADI 21 Aug 2014 on B737/800. Check in was efficient. As we were running late after a hold up going though security we had to rush through duty free and find our way to the gate. All the way to the end. We had to run as they announcing gate close time in 5 mins. We made it with another couple who just flown in from London via Dubai. We left promptly at 6.30am. Breakfast was slow in being served but it was tasty and hot. Coffee was good too but was slow in coming. Crew were nice and offered all the passengers Fiji beer prior to our arrival at Nadi. Entertainment is from drop down screens for movies. Music channels have a good selection. Our luggage was off in quickly and we were out of arrivals in about 30 mins to wait for party from NZ.

### Fiji Airways customer review
I flew from Auckland to Nadi on FJ410 and back a week later on FJ411 both flights were on the new Airbus A330. On the way over the food was terrible Udon noodles next so some pieces of chicken it was the worst airline food I have ever had. The flight on the way back put me off Fiji Airlines the pilot seemed to try to take off to soon and but the noise of the aircraft back on the ground before trying to take off again about 5 seconds later. The food on the way back was marginality better but only just edible. The entertainment system was ok some of the settings were "unavailable for this flight" there were about 10 movies and 10 TV shows to chose from at least half of these were Indian and a few were Chinese but most were in English. The landing back at Auckland was fast but smooth and was the only point on this flight. The attendants were always nice and cheerful. All up only fly with this airline if you want to think you are going to die from lack of oxygen when the air conditioning unit starts making sounds.

### Fiji Airways customer review
I recently had to fly from Port Vila to Suva for work. Fiji Airways has recently purchased some new ATR planes for these shorter-leg routes. The problem is these planes don't have enough storage capacity to fit everyone's luggage if the flight is full. On the Vila-Suva leg the passengers weren't told that all of our luggage had been offloaded and left in Vila until some time after we arrived in Suva and stood around waiting in the baggage claim area. The customer service was pretty much non-existent and it took 2 days to get our bags. The return flight to Vila the following Sunday used the same airplane with the same result. It's now been 3 days and no word about our luggage. It's not lost; they know exactly where it is but they won't send it to us or contact us on its status. No FA staff met us in Vila and have been ignoring repeated emails. Avoid Fiji Airways if you can!

### Fiji Airways customer review
Recently I traveled LAX-NAN-SYD and return and I must say I was very pleasantly surprised! This airline is rated 3 stars but should be higher. I traveled in business class and wasn't sure what to expect reading less than kind reviews but I was very happy with the service. The seat was very comfortable for sleeping and the FA's were very kind and pleasant. the meals were fine and the lavatories were kept clean through out the flight. There is a mandatory layover in Nadi for 3+ hours in each direction but the lounge is pleasant enough though rudimentary.

Christchurch to Fiji FJ451 and left Christchurch on 2nd August 2014 left Fiji for Christchurch on 9th August 2014. I found that Fiji Airways were pretty good. Plenty of leg room. Helpful flight attendants. The food wasn't so good but plane food is renowned to be bad! I would definitely fly with them again.

### Fiji Airways customer review
On transit in Nadi my name was not on the passenger list even though I had a ticket. According to a Fiji Airways representative this was normal: the communication between their central reservations and the airport could be better. Our flight to Honiara was aborted over Vanuatu and we returned to Nadi where Port Vila passengers were told to leave the plane and the rest of us were informed that we would have direct flight to Honiara. This departed three-and-half hours later. Two hours were spent matching the boarding passes with passenger lists. We arrived in Honiara at night after a six hour delay. The once-in-a-week return flight Honiara - Nadi was cancelled. There would have been alternative connections with empty seats e.g. Honiara - Port Moresby - Nadi for passengers such as myself who had a Fiji Airways connection to LAX but we were left stranded there without re- routing help or information. I never saw a Fiji Airways representative after the problems surfaced. Personally I managed to buy a Virgin Australia seat to Brisbane at a local travel agency a visa to Australia at the airport and book transit accommodation in the Internet connecting with my Nadi - LAX flight the next day just on time. In Nadi not even a single apology was heard. The next time I will spend a little more for a more reliable service and skip Fiji altogether instead of risking a need to by a second ticket to reach my destination.

Flew SYD-NAN and return leg ten days later. Flights were punctual on both legs planes clean seats comfortable service very friendly and decent food. IFE was perfectly adequate for a 4 hour flight. Would happily use Fiji Airways again.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Very disappointed. Our trip from Sydney to Nadi was cancelled from a 6.30am departure to an 11.55am departure so lost 1/2 a day at the resort and our return flight was brought forward from a 6.30pm departure to a 9am departure which meant in total of our 7 day holiday was reduced to 5.5 days - not good enough. Unfortunately I have already booked and paid for a trip later this year and my return flight has already been changed to an earlier morning departure reducing that trip by one day can only hope they don't change the departure time from Sydney but not holding my breath. Would not recommend Fiji Airways to anyone.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Just back from a trip to Fiji. The only sour point of the entire trip was Fiji Airways. Like everyone else we bumped into our flight was changed. For us we were not notified of this change until we were in Fiji We lost half a day of our holiday because of this. In fact we had to fly another airline home (I give virgin Australia 10 out of 10). I will not fly Fiji Air again. Poor customer service bad food poor online tools and an old plane!

### Fiji Airways customer review
When attempting to fly back from Apia (Samoa) to Sydney via Nadi Fiji Airways moved the Apia-Nadi flight from 5.30am in the morning to 6.30pm. This meant I could not make the Nadi-Sydney connecting flight. There were no seats Nadi-Sydney the following day. At no point was I contacted by Fiji Airways. I approached the ground staff in Brisbane (where I departed from) and in Nadi. I didn't get any assistance let alone an apology. Gave up in the end and flew home with Virgin.

I was booked on a flight LAX to Nan FJ11 13th May. I booked a flight from Chicago to LAX on United as I was not sure what day I was going to travel. I was informed when I arrived in O'Hare that all flights had been cancelled but flights were being opened up and it looked like all would be well although less than the three hours. I called Fiji Airways to give them a heads up. I was informed it was the weather that caused the problem however then learned it was a fire in one of the main traffic towers. Again I called and informed Fiji Airways what was transpiring and that my flight was getting me in later. Finally we started to board and I called and said that I was going to miss the flight - this was a good 4 hours before FJ811 was due to take off. I was told that the fare was to be $120 for the change plus the change in fare which came to a total of $350. While I was giving my credit card information I was cut off. I immediately called back as I was in line to board and was then informed the fare was now $780. I do not know what sort of scam that was in motion but I am disgusted at the manner that the transaction occurred and feel I should be compensated back to the $350. A change of one day cannot be almost a full fare. I called numerous times to say I was going to be late and was accepting the change in price but to go to double in a matter of 2 minutes is contemptible and it would appear on the surface a way to extract more money due to duress. Very very disappointed in your airline.

Sitting here at the Sofitel (April 16th) in Denauru after Fiji Airways cancelled our return trip tomorrow to a day later. With that new schedule now they are wanting us to move for one night to another hotel. We are arriving a day later home plus with the new itinerary of our connecting flights have added an 10 hour wait in LA. Not fun. The least they could do is leave us here in this resort as we are being disrupted quite enough.

NAN (Nadi) to LAX (Los Angeles) on 24 Mar 2014. Very pleasant experience. Reassuring new A330-200 aircraft professional crew efficient and helpful ground staff. Flight was delayed and rescheduled to next early morning: transparent communication swift providing of transport accommodation and food in Nadi as well as in Los Angeles. Would recommend Fiji Airways over other airliners in the Pacific region.

### Fiji Airways customer review
I used Fiji Airways to travel from Los Angeles to Nadi on flight number FJ811 on December 31 2013. After we checked in and were waiting to board the plane the Gate number was changed and we were given another Gate number to go to. Once there the Supervisor announced that the flight was being delayed and kept announcing that every 30 minutes. Later that night we were told the flight was cancelled and was not going to fly at all due to maintenance. We requested that we be re-routed via Australia or New Zealand so we could arrive into Nadi on time but nothing was done to help us. After waiting for hours at the Airport Fiji Airways arranged hotel accommodation for us. Later they provided a taxi and we arrived at the hotel at 2.30am. Our baggage was already checked in and we did not have any clothes on us. Back at the airport we were told to go to the gate and our names will be called if there was space in the plane. To our surprise they fitted all passengers from December 31 and January 1st on one plane. Therefore they combined the passengers of December 31 and January 1 on that one plane which flew on January 1st.

Personnel very kind. Food ok and seat comfort great. The long flight from Hong Kong to Nadi was a pleasure. Drinks were served all the time. Checking my baggage through to final destination with another airline was absolutely no problem.

Flew BNE-NAN as part of a longer itinerary in business. I wasn't provided with an express pass in BNE for exit immigration when I checked in though I barged my way through when they saw the biz class ticket. The ordinary line was 150 deep. The Qantas lounge in BNE used by FJ leaves something to be desired for an int'l biz lounge but it's adequate. The cabin condition on the 737 was worn. Service was excellent. The salmon in my lunch was rather desiccated from overcooking. Wines ok good spirit selection. Dessert was delicious and simple: a strawberry mousse cake. Would recommend.

Flew FJ from LAX to SYD via NAN LAX-NAN was on a A330-200 the plane condition was good and clean still had the new plane smell the seats were comfortable even it was angled flat the meal and the service was good and was able to get 6-7 hours of sleep. We had 5 hour layover in NAN as we arrived at 4am every shop and lounge was closed until after 6am. The lounge condition at NAN was OK at best. Originally was booked on a A332 from Fiji to Sydney but noticed that they have switched equipment to B738 was looking forward to stretch out on flat bed seats and watch couple of movies on the 4 hour journey but unfortunately had to put up with regular recliner seats and provided tablet to watch the movie the service and the flight crew were excellent.

29th Dec 2013 Sydney-Nadi-LAX then return on 29th Jan 2014 with 3 other family members. Very pleasantly surprised-all cabin staff on all 4 flights very friendly and polite. I asked for a hot tea during cold drink service and it was brought to me as soon as service had finished. Sydney-Nadi boarded 10mins late but managed to leave only 2 mins late and all flights arrived 30 mins early. Nadi was longest transfer as only 1 person on desk. The food varied from ok to really good. It is airline food in Economy Class and Fiji Airways is not your top end Airline. Flight from Nadi-LAX left at 9.40pm so we had a small roll with vegetable patty served as snack but a large breakfast of scrambled eggs grilled veggies fruit muffin yoghurt juice and a breakfast bar. On return trip was prawn cocktail beef and rice fruit juice chocolate bar and scone. Both large meals were very tasty and vegetarian rolls also had a great flavour. Water was on offer regularly during flights. My only negative was that I had requested Vegetarian Meals for all 4 of us however this information did not get through. On trip to LAX there was a vegetarian option (although not booked) however on return flight there wasn't. The planes were new which was a bonus and seating although a little uncomfortable at times was probably more to do with being on a long flight than anything else. It felt no different to the 5hr flight Sydney to Perth on Qantas. Toilets were exceptionally clean at all stages of all flights. We went with Fijian Airways mainly due to cost. I was more than happy with the service and happy friendly nature of the cabin staff.

We booked our holiday's return flight trips to Fiji with Qantas airline. The route from London to Sydney was superb. Unfortunately Qantas have code shared with Fiji Airways and the trip from Sydney-Nadi-Sydney was operated by the Fiji Airways newest fleet. There's nothing good to say about the flight crew airline and services. The plane may be new but the inflight entertainment wasn't working properly and was told to pay if my family wanted to watch movies! There's no option when it comes to food. The only option including kids was a horrible wrap stuffed with scrambled eggs/chicken/tuna. The flight attendant looked disinterested and almost unwilling to help most of the time. Overall I personally wouldn't recommend Fiji Airways to anyone travelling to Fiji in the future.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Nadi to Melbourne. Flight was on time however there were multiple problems with the flight. Service staff was rude. They never handed out headsets so there were movies on but you couldn't hear them. I did ask an attendant for a headset but she said it would be a while because she had to serve everyone food and then she'd be able to bring it to me. Well I never did get the headset. The food is awful. Nobody expects great food on a plane but what they serve is just a small bun with some sort of nondescript patty coleslaw juice and a biscuit. Lastly we travelled with small children and they do not let people with small children board first. They also call people from certain rows and then just let anyone from any row board so it is a real free-for-all in terms of getting on the plane. Improve the service and the food and this airline could be considerably better.

Flew AKL-Nadi-LAX-Nadi-AKL in December 2013 and January 2014. Excellent service. Very nice clean and fresh cabin. Always on time (on the dot). Will definitely fly with Fiji Airways (Air Pacific) again in the future.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Air Pacific now Fiji Air went from Melbourne - Nadi return over Christmas. The plane took off on time with the new cabin fit out on the Airbus the seats recline flat with lots of space the screen in fixed position with an easy use remote control. Food And Drinks excellent without having to ask. The check-in areas at both ends very good as well.

### Fiji Airways customer review
LAX-NAN-BNE. Check in at LAX efficient and friendly. Boarding and departure smooth and punctual. The cabin crew were polite and efficient. The airbus still had that brand new feel about it. The personal IFE worked well though the selection was limited. The two meals served LAX to NAN were actually pretty good. Regrettably the seat width and pitch seemed the most constricted I had ever experienced in an economy class on any airline. After two hours in the air I was very uncomfortable and eventually just being there was something like torture. I was glad when we landed at Nadi and I had a chance to get off the plane. The flight from NAN to BNE was on a rather dated 737 but the seats were wider with more legroom. Unfortunately the uncomfortable seating conditions on the airbus preclude me from ever flying with this airline again no matter how cheap.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Nadi-LAX. Business. Return evening flight back to States from Fiji. Fiji Airways performed to the great standard flying down here a weeks ago. Full cabin with children in business but very well behaved. Service was prompt and friendly as crew tried to give us as much time to sleep. Meals very good and seat was comfortable enabling 6 hours sleep which is great. I don't get that on BA club world. The angled flat sit is very good as I am not a fan of this seat at all. Breakfast wake was very cool with passengers lightly woken up which was a great touch. Will fly FA back to south pacific Australia and NZ again.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Booked to LAX out of AKL Dec 21 2013. Flight overbooked so many hours wait for an Air NZ flight. Return flight on Dec 31 didn't eventuate due to a breakdown. Over 6 hours spent in a remote departure area with few announcements and not even a coffee. Sent to a hotel with no bags and not even a toothbrush provided. Finally caught Air NZ flight 24 hours later.

MEL - Nadi and Nadi - HNL via Christmas Island. Booking-in in Melbourne was easy and we had no trouble changing to exit row seats with the very helpful air Fiji staff. Had a 12 hour layover between flights once in Nadi so needed to clear the airport which again was easy. Booking back in at Nadi airport was terrible. Only one counter open initially serving the business class passengers. Economy customers were booked in very slowly - we were 6th in the queue and it took us 45 minutes to get through. Flight was smooth although the air pocket we hit certainly woke everyone up. There was an hour layover in Kiribati on Christmas Island 5 hours into the leg to Honolulu. Worst experience we've ever had on a flight. Had to disembark and take all of our carry on. We were shuffled into what could be described as an animal holding pen which was at least out into the fresh air. We then had to be 'processed' in the most disgusting old building I've ever been in. Bags searched manually men had a hand held scanner waved over them and women got patted down. We were then herded into what could only be described as a chicken coup - the front door was locked and those lucky enough to get a seat had a good view out through the chicken wire window. Was very grateful it was only 30 deg outside as there was no fan and no air-conditioning - oh and the septic toilets joined onto the room so you can imagine the smell.

### Fiji Airways customer review
LAX-NADI. Business. What a great change this airline has made with fantastic crew superb planes and great food. The new A330 is a dream as are the seats one of the best angle flat I have slept on and got 6 hours sleep. The seat is incredibly comfortable. The cabin looks spacious. The crew are great and charming with nothing being a problem. Everything was delivered on a tray with a smile and bedding pulled out after dinner. Amazing surf and turf with good NZ wines breakfast was filling and delicious. We now have another Fiji Airways to AKL. Although the TV screens are large the film selection could be a little more current although not shabby. The overall performance is somewhat better than the Australian and New Zealand airlines. Would fly them again.

### Fiji Airways customer review
SYD-NAN-SYD. Price was approx 40% higher then other airline due to inflight entertainment/meal. Entertainment was Ok. Would have been better with sound. Meal was smaller than the kids meal chicken curry and rice. One of the worst crew I've ever seen in my 35 years of travelling. Jetstar Virgin Australia is 100% better.

### Fiji Airways customer review
MEL-NAN-MEL. Booked to fly out Saturday midday. FJ cancelled this flight and moved us to Friday night. 737-800 island of gau. Packed in sardines. Flight was delayed so much that ended up leaving just before 10 am SAT. New crew had to be called in. Seats were old uncomfortable dirty and falling apart. Food was ok. Crew not seen. Flight back was packed. Lady was throwing up during boarding and went through tonnes of sick bags. They ended up giving her a large garbage bag. Toilets would not lock. The next person in line would have to hold the door shut a sign said "fix in BNE". Plane was quarantined in MEL. Crew not seen. MEL-NAN 763 due for retirement next month. Still had lots of life left. BIZ half full mini economy cabin packed main cabin only had 15 people. Could stretch out easily. Food was chicken covered in avocado and rice served with salad chips and a bread roll. Plane was clean. Flight back was packed. Left on time. Food was just brown slop with a bone in it and rice. Blankets not clean nor was the plane. Entertainment poor crew not seen. Very disappointing.

Flew Melbourne to Nadi return in 2012 both legs delayed 1 hr. No reason given. Food I edible and service friendly but poor. Did same trip in August 2013 business class. Flight 2.5 hrs delayed with no warning. Sitting at the airport in Melbourne with three very small children until 2 am was awful. Plane downgraded to 737 from 747. No kids meals. Despite having 4 out of 8 business class seats we did not get a meal choice. No individual televisions except bright overhead ones that kept our kids awake the whole flight. Who needs TV at 4 am? Luggage lost. Flight back delayed 2 hrs but no communication. I can honestly say this airline is a disgrace. Would never fly them again.

### Fiji Airways customer review
SYD-LAX-SYD. Traveled on their 747 - the plane was in appalling condition. My wife was 5 months pregnant and her tray table had to be held up with a cushion TV did not work on any of our 3 seats (row 65 - but spoke to a lot of other people and their TV's did not work either) - food not fit for economy! Staff were pleasant enough but plane was falling apart cosmetically and because they retire the 747's in November no effort is made to make the journey more comfortable and no apology or compensation for putting up with such low standards. We requested to change to the newer planes hard enough to entertain a 3 year old for 17 hours but we booked as they said they had personal screens. Would help if they worked. I was very polite on the phone and asked if they could make this date change to travel on the Airbus a few days later and they said not without a high date change fee per person! Would never recommend them to anyone.

### Fiji Airways customer review
SYD-NAN 22 Sept 2013 early afternoon on FJ910 4 hours in transit lounge at NAN then straight onto FJ 810 on the airbus. Returned Tues 8 Oct 2013 FJ 811. Bags: Only allowed 1 bag as to check in anymore would cost 120 usd each - no notification on ticket or booking ref about this. Water: security take all your water off you even water purchased in transit lounge but sadly apart from a drink with so called meal there was no more water offered on LAX to Fiji flight. Food: would hardly feed it to my dog. Entertainment: if you get a seat that the wires work to the earphones you have done well. Speaker above us screamed some hideous noise for about a minute every 20 or so minutes for the whole trip and even though aircraft sat on tarmac during transit no repair was done so from Fiji to SYD same very loud screeching occurred. Legroom: new airbus had less room by far than what should be offered on a 10 hour leg 747 was better but still poor. Do not fly with them if you have the option!

### Fiji Airways customer review
Flew from LAX to NAN then to SYD. TVs and radio don't work for me or the 2 people next to me. The seat did not lie back. Did not get a choice in meal and could not eat the main which was given. Did not even get offered a drink from NAN to SYD. Cabin crew disinterested. And during the change over at NAN airport the staff were very rude searching all my carry on emptying everything and just leaving it so I had to re pack. I will not fly with them again!

### Fiji Airways customer review
Booked a flight via Qantas website so expected quality of a full flight airline which is code shared with Qantas. Bitterly disappointed MEL-NAN-MEL - 5.5 hour flight is extremely uncomfortable - even the new A330 has the most uncomfortable seats I have ever experienced. Food on a previous Jetstar flight to Hawaii was far superior to the chicken burger (mini) and mushy salad (mini). The flight to NAN was the coldest I have ever experienced. Entertainment was at a cost (except for one movie and three TV programs) - even music was at a cost. Staff were pleasant but not interested - so different to the resort staff and other tourist staff in Fiji. The airline has made a lot of the change of name and change of uniform - a change of value for money as a full priced airline is in order. Will not be going back to Fiji as am not prepared to fly Fiji Air again - looking for a more appropriate Qantas choice.

Flight Nadi to Brisbane 23 July A330 delayed due to female cabin crew running late. At least we had an update once she was located at the airport entrance. Food was really bad gooey substance squashed inside softish bun crew consuming something completely different (don't blame them) probably business class version. Cabin crew generally disinterested. Plane circulating over Brisbane Gold Coast repeatedly for around 45min until permitted to land.

MEL-NAN-MEL on 7/7/13 and 13/7/13. After waiting to check-in for an hour we were told there was no room on the flight and another flight would be organized for us just check-in at the Qantas desk at 6am. We went to Qantas at 4.30am and they had had no information from Air Pacific. Qantas staff were excellent and booked us on a Qantas flight to Auckland and then Air Pacific/Fiji Airways to Nadi. Some passengers had been warned about the lack of seats and others including ourselves had not. Return flight was on an old run down 747 IFE didn't work tray table broken terrible food in the infamous box and staff not overly interested. Again they were asking passengers at Nadi to delay their flight (offering accommodation and food).

### Fiji Airways customer review
Nadi - Melbourne - 15/06/2013 and 06/072013. All Melbourne flights delayed due to operational issues. This seems to be normal for Fiji Airways you turn up to the airport stand in the line for 45 minutes and get told the flight is delayed. Staff are rude for the reason that the travelers are frustrated with lack of information. Somehow the airline knows that they will not make the flights and fail to inform its customers. Melbourne to Nadi flights have been affected on the two dates mentioned.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Nadi to Auckland on 8th May. The New A330 jets seems to speak a lot about Air Pacific's effort to improve customer service and value for money. No problem with check-in and flight was on time. IFE was also not bad for a 3hr flight. Seat was comfortable with enough room. However should improve in providing proper inflight meal. Friendly staff with slimes always. Would surely fly with them next time.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Nadi-Sydney return on A330. Plane delayed due to mechanical fault. Captain said it would take a few minutes but instead we were 1 hour late. Food terrible service average. Very disappointed with this trip.

### Fiji Airways customer review
NZ - Nadi - NZ. Food was terrible on both flights. Pay for up to date entertainment on full fare flight - not on! Check in at Nadi 6 counters open only 3 staffed and telling us flight will be closed and over 100 passengers will be left behind. Flight to Sydney had 11 counters open. Flying again with AP in a few months with children already paid or would not be flying with them again.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Brisbane - Nadi - Brisbane on their brand new A330. Check in was a breeze. Flight left on time. A330 aircraft was clean and crew friendly. IFE had limited choices but enough for the 3.5 hour flight. Only let down was the food. On the way back was the same A330. Flight delayed 40 mins due to issues with the cargo hold. Food was a major let down once again. IFE had to pay to watch which doesn't make sense for a full service airline. Would only fly Air Pacific if fares were cheap again.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Sydney to Nadi June 7th on the brand new A330-200 (first time in use from SYD). What can I say they overtaken any European or US airline even Qantas (which code-share on these flights). Specious seats best legroom a full service airline can offer. Food was surprisingly very good. Free alcoholic beverages. Personal IFE on demand with the latest movies. A quick and good service. Always with a smile. I ask for vegi meal on board and immediately after take off received one. It seems they have made 180 degrees change for their new branding. I flew a lot with many airlines around the world and I'm not easily giving away complements. Except for the screaming Aussie kids which really not the airline fault the all experience was very good. Nadi to Sydney on 737-800. Not with personal IFE but again specious seats good service and food and landing on time. Incomparable to the no frills Virgin Australia or Jetstar.

Flew Brisbane to Nadi 2 weeks ago. Flight cancelled due to operational reasons 4 hours before departure. This was a midnight flight so operational reasons means not enough passengers. Had to pay out of our own pocket an extra nights accommodation. Awful customer service.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Flew in on business class 2 weeks ago and the staff were exceptionally friendly. I was offered food and drinks several times and the menu was quite satisfactory and had a lot of variety. They even placed the table mats for you I felt very pampered. The seats were very comfortable and there was a lot of room in the cabin. I didn't actually get to finish any in-flight entertainment because I slept for 8 hours straight.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Our trip to and from Fiji was at the best very average. The plane a Boeing 737 was dated. The food and refreshments were well below what we had expected and the service was so slow. Entertainment head phones didn't work on the way over and on the return flight there was no onboard entertainment.

### Fiji Airways customer review
B747-400 we flew Sydney to Nadi was in very poor condition internally the seats and entertainment system were barely useable. None of the video screens on headsets of the 7 travellers in our group worked properly. The food took top honours as the most appalling dried rolls filled with pastes of chicken or tuna. The cabin crew were generous and quick to keep up a steady supply of alcohol no doubt a ploy to try and make passengers forget their experience. 3.5 hrs was enough and I feel so sorry for those who cross the pacific for long hours to the USA in their poorly maintained aircraft.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Recently flew Air Pacific from Sydney to Nadi and return. The 737 was comfortable and the service was fine . Air Pacific provide on their medium haul service a perfectly adequate service.

### Fiji Airways customer review
I flew LAX-Nadi-AKL late Dec 2012 when a cyclone hit causing delays. That would have been completely acceptable had they responded in a professional manner. But the awful way in which the situation was dealt with had me lose all sympathy. Hours of delay in both LAX and Nadi Airport. People refusing to answer our questions or giving us different stories. Only one person working to serve hundreds of delayed passengers! They just didn't care and in Nadi many people were left to sleep on the airport floors. To top that off I received no response after weeks of communication.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Surprised at the poor service provided both at check-in and aboard flight. Also alarmed by the excessive baggage charges per kilo $20 per kilo for excess bag. Poor experience overall.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Roundtrip LAX-Nadi-Auckland in Feb. This is a tiny airline that is trying hard to provide good service. We got a great deal on our flights so my expectations were low from the get go. Their 747s are older. They only have 2. One was in better condition than the other. They are being retired this year. The inflight entertainment didn't work on many seats. Sometimes the screen wouldn't turn off so it was hard to sleep with it on. The seats recline perhaps a little too much which I'm guessing is to do with their age. The food is fair. The larger dinner and breakfast food was better than the smaller snacks. Its not as bad as some people have made it out to be on here. I would buy food in the airport if you are picky. They seem to keep their cabins on the warmer side so it was a bit uncomfortable until they lowered the lights for people to sleep. Then the temp got to a comfortable level. Staff were friendly and seemed to care about the airline and their work. Id fly them again on a budget.

### Fiji Airways customer review
I flew into LA only to wait 3 days for a flight to NZ! They were terrible at communicating and the problem had been going on for a week. They just kept letting more and more people show up and stand in endless lines and wait in a hotel with hopes of getting on 'the next flight'. We ended up getting to NZ on another airline! Return flight took us from NZ to Fiji where again we spent another 2 days mostly waiting in the endless lines at the hot and dirty airport. In LA missed all connections and had to figure out options without their help. They did nothing to compensate except put us up in a hotel and 1 meal. Stress and waiting not worth it.

### Fiji Airways customer review
The entire trip was a disaster. We arrived in LAX via AA and were given boarding passes for AP. We got all the way to the AP gate and they refused our boarding pass. We had to go all the way back to the AP counter and wait in line for hrs just get a boarding pass. Then plane was 2 hrs late. On the return we were never notified that our flight was cancelled! We had even gone to the counter early and they said to come back when we came back they said our flight was cancelled and they did not assist at the counter with new flights. We were stranded! When we were able to call (which took 2 hrs) to get a new flight the new flight was 3 hrs late! We had horrible seats with no leg room.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Nadi to LAX today and was pleasantly surprised. Flight was on time an upgrade was offered to upper deck and my wife and I had 3 seats each which allowed plenty of room and comfort. The dreaded food box arrived and to be honest for the time of night was perfectly adequate sandwich wrap crisps coleslaw and a drink. Breakfast was ok as well entertainment was adequate as well for a night flight. Staff were very good and flight arrived half hour early despite LAX's best efforts to delay us. I would have no problem using them again.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Flight was good and seats were comfortable enough. The staff were friendly and helpful. The only drawback was the food. I was shocked at the food content and the way it was presented. I have travelled to several countries on different airlines but I have never had food served to me in a cardboard box.

### Fiji Airways customer review
BNE-NAN-BNE. Basically this is an airline that charges full-fare for what is in reality a low-cost business model to them at least: awful food (a revolting soggy 'sandwich' of some kind and a small plastic pot of coleslaw on both the outward and return journey) a cramped ugly and dirty cabin toilet doors that do not lock. All this is mentioned in many other reviews. No IFE apart from the one movie broadcast from overhead. I was not interested in the selection at all. On the positive side beers wines and spirits are available and the crew do try and display the well-known Fijian friendliness and cheerfulness despite working in the same dismal conditions that we are travelling in. My points are mainly for getting us there on time-nay early even- and in one piece.

### Fiji Airways customer review
I chose them simply because they were by far the cheapest. I flew LA-Nadi-Sydney this morning: although this meant a nearly 4hour layover in Fiji it was actually the same 747 which took me the whole way. Check in was quick and friendly (even Tom Bradley operated favourably for me!) and my first impression of the cabin was that I liked the colour - somewhere between lilac and purple. I had no problems with the seats (although I did have a very large person sitting next to me on the second leg who kind of spilled into me I fixed that by moving) and they seemed to recline as much as any do. Dinner was fine the coffee actually tasted better than any other airline coffee I've had. Beer was freely available. I knew that breakfast would not be great but I don't really eat breakfast anyway. I also knew the IFE was old so came prepared. But the crew were the stars - full of good humour. Air Pacific is re-branding and has 3 new planes arriving this year one in March so grumbles about the 747 will soon be redundant.

### Fiji Airways customer review
MEL-NAN-MEL - Departed and arrived on time on both legs. Cabin crew were good. IFE very limited and food for a non-budget airline was beyond a joke. Due to change in circumstances we had to change our return flight in the end it was cheaper to get a one-way ticket than amend the existing booking. There are limited carriers to Fiji therefore have few options unless you want to upgrade to business class.

### Fiji Airways customer review
PER-SYD-NAN return. Given we booked with Qantas we had not realised the SYD-NAN leg was with Air Pacific under their codeshare agreement until it was too late too change. I can only reiterate what others have said. The food is a joke the IFE barely functions and the seats are very uncomfortable. The toilets were filthy the sinks did not drain and so on. Felt very sorry for people going all the way to or from LAX.

### Fiji Airways customer review
We travelled from LAX to AKL. We found them excellent no delays fast check-in lots of leg room on the 747. The food was good the staff were friendly and the entertainment centre was old and didn't work very well - however most people wanted to sleep. I will fly with them again.

### Fiji Airways customer review
I had not been expecting much in the light of previous comments but I was pleasantly surprised by a well- organised flight. It was a late evening flight and the airport and lounge were deserted. The fairly small lounge had good canapés and drinks but only one computer and very little reading matter. The 737 appeared old and the seat rather battered. I could not make the recline controls work properly. The 8-seat business cabin was full. The beef dinner with wine was tasty. The cabin crew were friendly and efficient. IFE was satisfactory for the length of flight. The flight departed on time and arrived slightly early. Apart from the old seat a very good flight.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Sydney - Nadi return. Check in good on time flight. My issues were with the food and entertainment. For a full service airline the food was appalling and inedible. 06.30 flight food consisted of orange juice tiny yoghurt bag of sliced apple and a small piece of fruit cake! Return trip was orange juice 2 biscuits tiny tub of pasta and a tiny hotdog in a bun. It was also barely warm. Any extra food was charged for. I have been fed better on no frills airlines! Entertainment was drop down screens from ceiling that due to the seat I was in was either too far away or right above me making watching impossible. I understand the entertainment will be fixed when their new planes arrive! I will fly another airline next time.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Flight was on time - no trouble with check-in or out. We got food and headphones/movie included without charge and pillow etc. Got from A to B in good time. Staff warm and attentive. Our drop-down TV was broken but kids could move to aisle seat to see another one.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Worst experience in 30+ years of flying. Checked with airline 3 times prior to going to the airport as there had been a storm in Fiji. Told all was well and on time. Arrived at airport and stood in line for 2 hours to be told of a 12 hour delay. Got to LA far too late to catch any planes to San Francisco. Put up in a reasonable hotel but then the same thing happened in LA! Told we were booked to San Francisco to find the flight was cancelled the night before and we weren't notified. Didn't get to SFO until nearly midnight after spending a night in LA. Things happen but keep us informed and don't make people stay in airport lounges for 10-12 hours needlessly. Will never fly with them again.

My wife and I were booked on a flight from Sydney to LAX (with stop in Nadi) on Dec 9 2012. About midnight on Dec 8 I called to confirm the flight and was told the flight from Nadi to LAX had been cancelled. No attempt to notify anyone on the flight. Told Air Pacific would provide vouchers but no other assurances were made. There was a long wait in Nadi for Air Pacific to make arrangements for all the passengers. There was a minimal voucher provided that did cover the hotel cost plus one meal. The flight to LAX the next morning was on an ancient 747. In the 3 seats in which my wife and I were located and the 3 in front only 1 light worked. Two seats did not recline. None of the 6 seats had a working TV so there was no entertainment. The food was bad. When we finally arrived in LA we were told that Air Pacific would not reimburse any expenses we incurred except for providing hotel in LA. We were forced to pay the change ticket costs of our connecting flight in LA.

### Fiji Airways customer review
AKL-NAN on 12 Dec. The service and food was unacceptable considering the cost of a return ticket I have travelled a lot with Air Pacific in the past and the service and food has deteriorated considerably. Food and beverage supplied - small hot dog container of inedbiel pasta and an orange drink - smacks more of a low level budget airline. My wife and I also travelled from NAN to CHCH return on 23 and 30 Dec. Same horrible inedible food and definitely no Xmas spirit. Shocked at the quality of the food on this flight considering its a 4 hr journey. We travel for the last time with Air Pacific to AKL on the 13th Jan.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Return trip Honolulu to Brisbane. My wife and I arrived at Honolulu International and were told that our flight to Brisbane was delayed two hours and we might not make our connection in Nadi to Brisbane but Air Pacific would get us on another flight and accommodate us as necessary. We had no issue with this as delays happen. When the two hours were up the airline announced that there would be a further 90 minutes delay and they would issue a voucher for lunch. We returned to the gate after 90 minutes and Air Pacific told us that the aircraft would not be flying. After a considerable time we managed to retrieve our bags lined up for the shuttle. We were about to board our shuttle when Air Pacific staff turned up to announce our aircraft was now flying - everyone thought he was joking. They had to retrieve people from hotels who had already checked in. Again we had to check our bags back in and go through security. Finally we were aboard the aircraft 7 hours late. We arrived in Nadi at midnight - a general announcement was made about the options. There was mass queue jumping and they were dealing with 2 or 3 people at once - it was farcical. When we got to talk to someone we asked could we fly to the Gold Coast. At first this couldn't be done then this changed and we were on an Air Pacific flight to Auckland then a Virgin flight to the Gold Coast. We went to the shuttle to be transferred to the overnight hotel. In Auckland the Transfer Desk is only manned by Air NZ and they issued us Qantas boarding passes to Brisbane. The flight to Brisbane was like 5 star service compared to 2 star service we had received from AP.

Flew Nadi to LAX on 10 Dec 12. No boarding organization. Paid a lot extra to sit in Business Class. Narrow uncomfortable seats. Seat broken - would not recline so little or no sleep during 10 hr flight. Headset broken sound was all static no movie menu from which to chose screen was extremely small movie already in progress and no controls to restart. Because of this didn't watch or listen to anything. Because of dietary restrictions could not eat anything on the dinner menu. Cheese offered during inflight snack was stale. Ordered drink which I did not receive. Always had to ask for water or get your own. Slow unacceptable service. This was not even close to any other Business Class comfort and service. Will not fly Air Pacific again.

Flew out Nadi on Tuesday 18/012/12. Ground staff were helpful. Flight crew and service very good given the circumstances. It would have been have nice if senior management were on hand to help staff on ground. Will fly any time with Air Pacific.

Flew from LAX to NAN and back. TVs don't work. Food is pathetic. Cabin crew disinterested. NAN check-in is long lines with unfriendly staff. Less than 1kg in excess will be charged. Had to remove clothes from checked bag and put in carry-ons in front of people watching you.

Flight SYD-Nadi on 7th Jan 2012. Flight was cancelled and ground staff unhelpful. Contacted the reservation team in Fiji that appeared helpful at first but were really were not accommodating. Had to book alternative flight to reach destination. My return flight from Nadi to Sydney was with the carrier on a Boeing 737-800. The flight was mediocre nothing memorable. Staff pleasant enough but not above the call of duty. The Customer relations sector are very difficult to deal with.

Our flight home from Fiji to Sydney was scheduled for 9am it was delayed 2 hours and ended up being delayed 7 hours before we left at 4pm. Our flight broke down in Sydney and they didn't have an aircraft for us. Once they had arranged an aircraft it wasn't even Air Pacific it was a Portuguese airline. We arrived in Sydney at 7pm but had missed our flight scheduled for 5pm back home. Air Pacific refused to take responsibility for the delay. We were stranded in Sydney overnight and they basically told us to sleep on the floor of the airport. We found quick accommodation and rebooked flights.

NAN-SYD Boeing 737-800. Check-in was quick through dedicated business class check in with friendly check- in staff. Express through security and immigration. Tabua lounge is small and adequate choice of drinks and food was just sandwiches. Plane was old and seats were uncomfortable was an old aircraft. Cabin crew friendly and attentive. Didn't have my choice of meal but my food option was excellent. Entertainment pretty old and screens were small. All in all good flight but planes need to be upgraded. Looking forward to tying then new A330 when they start flying.

Flew to Hawaii via Fiji. Flight delayed for over 3 hours in Sydney due to internal PA system not working. All passengers were on board and communication was limited. This delay caused us to miss our connecting flight to Hawaii and the next flight out was Sunday evening. Service was below standard - flight attendants didn't display any concern for your situation and the food was awful. If you do send an email to provide feedback or raise a complaint they take about 4-5 weeks to respond - you have to keep following up with them. I would recommend using another carrier when travelling to Fiji.

### Fiji Airways customer review
NAN-VLI. Check-in was smooth and quick. Friendly agents at the counter. The Tabua lounge is a nice area to relax whilst waiting for the flight grabbing a snack and working on emails. Hostess on board was friendly and attentive making sure I was comfortable and if I wanted anything to drink when my glass was getting empty! Felt like being in a nice restaurant. Food was ok not the best but edible!

### Fiji Airways customer review
Upon boarding we weren't greeted at all. I sat down to find my seat was broken which the flight attendants ignored me whenever I tried to point it out. They continued to be quite disinterested throughout the flight. The inflight entertainment screen (one every three rows from the roof) was broken so we couldn't watch the movie so the flight was a little boring! I would choose to fly with a different airline in the future.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Sydney to Nadi (747). The cabin crew were excellent and polite however what let the experience down was the very sub standard in flight meals and entertainment. I have never seen until now that the meal was delivered in a box similar to a Happy Meal that contained an artificial sausage on a bread roll a fruit juice cup of paste and some biscuits. I remember the old Air Pacific that had a 1st menu for economy. The seats on the flights were so close that when the person in front put their seat back you couldn't see the entertainment screen. The actual movies and picture quality was so poor you could not watch the movies. My advice is to select another carrier to Fiji.

### Fiji Airways customer review
With the exception of one flight departure change my wife and I found AP very good value for money. The positives were on time departure and arrivals for all but one of our 4 flights ground and air staff were helpful pleasant and courteous. Ordered special meals on every leg and they came prior to other passengers and they were correct every time. Yes the 747's they fly for long hauls are dated but they were comfortable enough and when I look at what other fares were from LA to Brisbane the value for money equation was decidedly in favour of Air Pacific for our budget. The only negative was a schedule change that came out of the blue. Overall budget considered I would fly AP again. A suggestion to potential future flyers of AP is to check double check and maybe even triple check your itinerary at each leg of your journey.

### Fiji Airways customer review
LAX to Nadi and back in October 2012. On the flight down TV screens did not work no overhead light working and their were no air vents. Staff tried to fix TV sets after their solution didn't work all they could say was 'sorry do you want a comment card'. On the way home from Nadi to LAX we were hoping for better seats and got worse. The seat in front of me was completely broken and occupied by a rather large lady when she sat down she was practically in my lap and our TV screens didn't work again. Food was awful service poor.

### Fiji Airways customer review
We flew in Sep and Oct 2012 from LAX to Nadi on our way to Port Vila Vanuatu. All four segments were on time to the minute. All checked baggage which originated in SLC through Delta arrived on time and unscathed. Meals were adequate and served with a smile. Seats were no more uncomfortable than any other 747-400 (although the transfer airport in Nadi was woefully inadequate.) We would not hesitate to fly with them again.

### Fiji Airways customer review
FJ910 SYD-NAD on Fri 2 Nov this is a holiday or budget airline and rightly deserves the 2 star Skytrax rating. For lunch they provided a small hotdog juice small pasta salad and biscuits in a small box. Very bland. Seat was very uncomfortable - I guess old 747's while they wait for their new A330's in March. Inflight entertainment just didn't work. I won't fly again and fortunately flying back to Sydney with Virgin Australia tomorrow.

### Fiji Airways customer review
We flew Brisbane to LA and back. The food was awful as indicated in many reviews. On Brisbane to Nadi flight door lock for one of the toilets was broken and could not be locked and the other one was faulty as well but it was lockable - not very convenient obviously. On LAX-BNE flight ground staff said we should have Fiji visa to go on transit. She called Fiji department of immigration from US to get clearance and made us wait 20 minutes during check in realising that we did not need any visa she did not apologise at all instead she mentioned that we are not allowed to go to Fiji and we have to transit to Australia (which obviously was our intention in the first place).

### Fiji Airways customer review
SYD-Nadi-LAX 14-10-12. Flight was ok food - the worst airline food I've seen. Staff very slow or just not enough of them they give you your boxed meal drinks etc at cruising height then about 1 hour later they finally come back to collect the rubbish. At this point you are locked in by your tray table. LAX-SYD 25-10-12 overall the same problem as 1st flight - terrible food slow staff. My girlfriends TV didn't work the plane sat at LAX with APU ground power problems then a full blackout for 15 minutes.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Brisbane to Nadi on 19/10/2012 found the flight comparable to other airlines based on the short length of the trip we were fairly satisfied. Flew a 747-800. The food as indicated on so many reviews was not the best however it is a short trip. Staff were great could not say the same for some of the passengers letting their kid run up and down the plane this flight was FJ920. Will be leaving on 29/10/2012 on flight FJ911 and will compare to the flight back to Sydney.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Travelled Sydney to Nadi return with 11 members of my family. Pre-arranged seating was ignored family scattered in several areas from front seat 2nd floor to second last row on lower deck. Food is perhaps the worst that I have ever experienced. Staff friendly but inefficient airline promises a child pack for entertainment. On 1 sector 2 of 4 delivered and on return with maybe 40 children on the flight none were distributed. Air Pacific is the only full service airline on this route but has it's own definition of full service. A very poor airline.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Flew Sydney and Nadi and back in September. All flights on time and staff friendly. The flights had a holiday feel with the island themed music when you first board. The dreaded lunchbox service was a bit of a shame - there wasn't much food and what was there wasn't very appetizing. The 747 service is by an old Singapore Airlines plane (still some logos in the toilets) with the old first-generation seatback from the late 90s. The movies aren't on demand so you can safely watch one but the second will probably be cut half-way through when they switch the system off some time before landing.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Flew from Melbourne to Nadi on March 2012. Flight got delayed (as always). No explanation given. Our return flight was delayed due to weather and communication. Having paid premium airfare food served was pathetic. A chicken burger with a cold slice of chicken on a tiny bun. Air Pacific needs to revamp it's catering and customer service to win good ranking as other airlines like Emirates Singapore etc. I will definitely choose another airline next time.

### Fiji Airways customer review
They changed flight times by 8 hrs without giving notice. This caused missed connections with other airlines and left us stranded without hotel reservations. Airline staff could not care less were rude and surly. This is a budget airline with no customer service cancellations and changed flight times and is not worth flying.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Travelled Air Pacific for the first time in August 2012 with my wife to Los Angeles with a stop in Fiji to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Flight was delayed over 1 hour before takeoff with no communication on the reason for the delay or how long until take off. We were kept seated on the aircraft without air conditioning on a very hot day during this period. In any case I accept these things happen and is not the reason for my dissatisfied flight. On arrival to Los Angeles for our three week vacation my luggage was missing and no assistance provided to find it besides asked to complete a form. It was only one week later when they called and advised another patron had mistaken taken it.

### Fiji Airways customer review
My first experience flying with Air Pacific I found the meals to be very unsatisfactory. Sydney to Nadi at 6.30am I survived only on an apple bag small yoghurt and juice. Couldn't stomach fruit cake at that time of day. On return from Nadi to Sydney midday meal was worse. Some sort of terrible chicken sausage thing on a dinner roll (that my two children found inedible) biscuits and juice. Almost a five hour flight and I had to ask for additional biscuits as my kids were starving which the air hostess wasn't impressed about. Had to stay on the tarmac in Sydney and wait for quarantine to board our plane to check on a sick child. Overall not very impressed.

### Fiji Airways customer review
SYD-NADI on 737 and return on 747. No complaints with the actual flight itself and the staff were polite and as good as other airlines. However the catering on board at the moment is insufficient and not appropriate for a full service air fare. On the way over on the early morning flight we were served the dreaded 'breakfast pack' along with tea/coffee/water. The box contained apple pieces tiny orange juice tiny yoghurt and a small piece of fruit cake. Even know it is a relatively short flight this is not good enough when leaving at 0630. Unfortunately the return flight was worse and after a 60min delay after boarding we again received the 'box' which contained orange juice yoghurt a small tub of fruit salad and a cup cake the size of a 20c coin. This was all that was served in 5.5 hours of flights with no further offers of drinks or snacks. People had to grab the hostesses as they walked past (the call buttons did not work) and ask them for food and drinks as they were hungry. Not good enough in my view and would not fly with them again if could help it. If you do fly with them fill your bag with food.

### Fiji Airways customer review
On round the world trip I was connected with Air Pacific flights from Christchurch to Nadi and again from Nadi to Sydney. I was really happy with the flight staff but I was so disappointed with the in flight meal. Served in a small box with very small portions. If I did not take my own I would have been very hungry on arrival. That was a major let down. I would understand if it was a charter flight but a full fare I expected more.

### Fiji Airways customer review
My first flight from LAX was cancelled. Did leave the next day. However I missed my next flight from Nadi to Savusavu. Had to overnight in terrible hotel and bad food. Return trip flight cancelled from Savusavu to Nadi. Had to overnight 2 nights in another bad hotel with even worse food. I spent 4 extra days in travel on one trip. Air Pacific does not care about customer service because they are the only airline that goes direct from LAX to Fiji. I spent $6000 on air fares and stayed at the same hotels as coach customers. Meal vouchers were also at the same restaurants.

### Fiji Airways customer review
I have been travelling to Fiji for many years on Air Pacific and yes the service has changed considerably particularly in the last two years. I have left some negative feedback in the past. However we must accept changes. Is it absolutely necessary that people travelling from the east coast of Australia be offered more than a snack and something to drink. In economy now on an early afternoon flight you get a cup of tea and a biscuit. Yes there are some things that we would probably like to have changed. No mechanical problems more flights for greater flexibility. Would I recommend Air Pacific? Yes. For a very small airline (five planes flying internationally) they don't do a bad job.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Travelled SYD to LAX stopping in Nadi. Very impressed staff were helpful the entertainment systems were great and each seat had quite a lot of legroom and reclined quite far back. Excellent for the price paid caught a sale for only $634 return!

### Fiji Airways customer review
A 4 hour delay at Sydney Airport for a 6.30am flight of which 1.5 hours was on the plane waiting on the 27/7/2012. A message comes over saying sorry but we are also short on catering for the trip a piece of fruit cake a little yoghurt a bag of sliced apple and an orange juice. Lucky the staff were so nice. The trip home on the 3/8/2012 was worst - the flight was cancelled. No real explanation from staff but they did get us on a Virgin flight but we had to pay for food and drink.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Left Sydney at 6.30am and the breakfast was dreadful a small piece of dry fruit cake with a baby sized yoghurt and fruit juice. That is not acceptable. The staff were very good though and the seats comfortable the return journey from Nadi to Sydney the lunch was not any better dreadful food even for an airline. Very disappointing.

### Fiji Airways customer review
We have flown between Sydney and Nadi for the past 8 years and have chosen Air Pacific because full cabin service is included in the airfare. Their website asserts "your meal will be a sumptuous reflection of South Pacific cuisine. We have found the food acceptable up to 2011 but this year we had the "box". The contents were a small bland container of tasteless pasta a tiny chicken wrap with very little chicken in it and a tiny packet of corn chips. Next year we will look at cut price alternatives Virgin and Jetstar that do not include meals and think about taking our own sandwiches.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Just got back yesterday so both legs of journey was pretty average to say the least. My seat had no TV operating that is no overhead light no service button nor did 6 out of the 8 we travelled with. Staff very sweet so no complaints there. Overall from Sydney to Nadi its not that long a flight so I really didn't care however if this was a long haul service it would be a different story.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Flight: In last month. AKL-SUV 737-700. The flight was disappointing. Considering the quality of the flight. The food was cold icy cold to be exact. In flight entertainment was not suitable for the length of the flight as the movie had to stop prematurely. The aircraft interior looked old and worn out. The flight was full of carry on luggage. During takeoff some sort of chemical smell was in the cabin. The flight was boring. But the upside was that the aircraft took less time to complete the journey then expected. Clearly not worth choosing Air Pacific.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Flight: In last month. I flew on 6/24 from Nadi to LA. The staff were not helpful or courteous. The inflight entertainment did not work. The food was not edible. I only flew this airline because I was travelling to Fiji and there aren't any other airlines operating direct flights on this route but I will never fly them again.

### Fiji Airways customer review
We requested a window seat but even though we were early in the check in queue were given last row seats- almost no recline and very poor air conditioning. Most uncomfortable trip ever. These seats should be sold only at a huge discount - they are not fit for human habitation.

### Fiji Airways customer review
31st of May 2012 flight from Auckland to Nadi. The flight was delayed at Auckland. In flight the food was pathetic. The crew members were good. Their service was excellent. Also at NAdi upon arrival had to stay in the plane for 3/4 hour. The service was not good. From Nausori to Auckland the food was cold pasta with Tuna. Better to tell passengers that there is no food on board rather than giving rubbish. The crew members for AKLD-Nadi flight their service was excellent very friendly and very approachable.

### Fiji Airways customer review
What a disappointment. I have travelled for many years between Sydney and Nadi return but was shocked this month at the breakdown of customer service by cabin staff. Also the appalling "meal in a box" almost thrown at us. The box contained cold pasta with a splash of some type flavouring a cold and dried out Roti and a small packet of corn chips. All inedible. Everyone around me complained. Make sure you eat before boarding! There at 2 toilets on the 737-800 for 154 economy and 1 toilet for 8 business class seats. Disgraceful. The economy toilets are located at the rear of the plane and as the trolley is mostly in the aisle just try getting 154 people including kids to the toilet during the 4 hour flight while the 8 in Business class rest in comfort!

### Fiji Airways customer review
Nadi-Melbourne. Check-in quick and polite at dedicated Business check-in although only available 3 hours before flight. Lounge basic but comfortable and away from kids. Flight departed on time. Aircraft downgraded from 747 and re-timed 2 hours earlier but this was communicated via email. Seat comfortable enough for 737 with much better leg room than Qantas J 737’s. Did not eat however the menu looked extensive. Crew happy to put aside a cheese plate for later and wines kept topped up. Service delivered efficiently if not as enthusiastically as I would expect. IFE available but was unwatchable due to video and audio quality. Digi-players provided on some flights/aircraft and I would have appreciated these being available for this 6 hour flight given Air Pacific seem to be aware of the poor quality of the IFE. Priority bags delivered first and through customs and on the way home in 20 minutes of arriving. Would be disappointed in this flight except that the sale price of our J fare was only A$250 more than discounted economy fare so excellent value for some extra comfort in this small cabin of 8.

### Fiji Airways customer review
We travelled from Nadi to Auckland and the flight was awful. A few years ago you used to get a nice hot meal with quite a good breakfast and lunch/dinner. These days they serve you garbage in green cardboard boxes consisting of snacks which cost less than $10. You are better to grab a snack at the Airport before boarding as the food is awful. Air Pacific seems to have become a budget airline all of a sudden yet the airfare prices remain the same.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Nadi to Sydney 28 April 2012. Revamped 737 with Jetstar style seats - leather and no adjustable head rests. Service is fine but the light breakfast was appalling. Coffee - worst I've ever tasted on a plane. As always the service was friendly but really the food is disgusting.

### Fiji Airways customer review
My wife and I travelled NAN-Melbourne April 6th after 2 hours in the air told we had to return to Nadi. Landed and were given vouchers for hotels covering stay food phone calls etc. The down side was the complete lack of contact by ground staff in Nadi in rebooking - all had to be done by the passengers.

### Fiji Airways customer review
YVR-LAX-NAD-AUK return: NAD-AUK delayed 4hrs due to crew shortage stranded at LAX on return due to mis-scheduling of connection by Air Pacific. They denied responsibility and refused to pick up the phone to get me another flight. Planes dirty food awful. Not worth the savings.

### Fiji Airways customer review
We connected in Los Angeles from Alaska Airlines to Air Pacific for our Fiji flight. We walked between terminals however the boarding pass issued by Alaska in Seattle was not sufficient to get past TSA at the International Terminal. Wwe felt very rushed at LAX and were the last to board. We sat in Row 28 with no one between us so had an extra seat. My TV didn't work so it was a long 10 hours. The food was fine plenty of it and nice flight attendants. On the return we opted for the upgrade sat in the upper level of the 747 3 seats across each and slept from Nadi to LAX.

### Fiji Airways customer review
BNE-NAD-LAX return. Ground/call centre staff are deplorable. We had our flights changed with 2 missed connections and weren't notified. Only upon noticing the changes were we able to rebook our flights which meant extended layovers in Fiji. We were told due to the delay our hotel would be covered by Air Pacific. We arrived in Nadi to find the help desk closed and at the hotel told there was no booking. Hard to review because the flights were perfect on time with ok food inflight entertainment was hit and miss but the flights were midnight ones so it was mostly sleep time anyway.

Brisbane-Nadi-LA return LA-Nadi-Brisbane. I purchased the tickets for an excellent price but having read the reviews was apprehensive prior to travelling. My family and I were pleasantly surprised. The 747-400 was comfortable and the service was excellent. I would certainly fly them again.

### Fiji Airways customer review
SYD to Nadi and Nadi to LA. We had no problems the 747 is older but seats were comfortable staff friendly and I had enough leg room compared to Jetstar. Food passable but average compared to other airlines. Inflight entertainment was poor but we had our ipad. If you're on a budget like we were I recommend Air Pacific.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Sydney-Nadi and Nadi-LA return with a stop over in Nadi on return to Sydney. Staff are lacking in professionalism and basic courtesy. From Nadi to Sydney we were advised we are only allowed one piece of carry on luggage and had to pay excess baggage and check-in the second piece of carry on. Encountered substantial delays which seemed to be the result of poor organization. Onboard it was hit and miss if personal screens actually worked and some of the seating did not recline - not comfortable for a 10 hour flight. The food was a warm unrecognizable soft slop consistency.

### Fiji Airways customer review
AKL-NAN. 747-400. Flight delayed an hour. Once onboard the seats were quite roomy lots of leg room. Took a while for the IFE to get started. Before the meal service I got up and asked for a beer and was given two. The service was excellent and friendly. Food was basic but the sandwich was tasty.

### Fiji Airways customer review
My experiences with Air Pacific staff have been lacking in dignity professionalism and basic courtesy. I have seen an air-hostess roll her eyes and 'tch' at a young boy because he stopped her to ask for another drink. I walked to the galley to ask for a second drink. The female attendant picked up a glass that already had something in it and proceeded to put ice in it. I made a point of asking for a fresh glass. Her response was immediately sarcastic 'oh you don't want this one..okaaay' and when she handed me my 'fresh' glass remained with her back to me while continuing her conversation with her colleague. Shabbiness has become common behavior. On my flight outbound to Fiji FA sounded and behaved like it bored her to be there. I understand everyone has a bad day but this has been my experience often.

### Fiji Airways customer review
I travel to and from Melbourne to Nadi every 3 months in business. Part of my enjoyment of the upgrade is the business lounge before boarding. For about 1 year now the business lounge has downgraded! There used to be a wide variety of snacks as well as a good selection of wine and champagne. Now one can only expect toasted sandwiches no wine no champagne no nuts of course the spirits are still there but I always leave hungry- disappointing considering the extra money I paid. Once onboard I have to agree that most flight attendants are rude and make you feel as if you are bothering them. As the planes are usually small by the time the attendant gets to you often your meal choice has run out. The wine on offer is so cheap it should not even be offered in economy let alone Business Class. Also used to receive complimentary toiletry bags now they have also been stopped! I would like to know why when we are paying more and the prices are going up but the quality is continually going down.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Auckland-Nadi and Nadi-LA return. We encountered substantial delays through the entire process which seemed to be the result of poor organization. Onboard it was hit and miss if the personal screen actually worked and some of the seating did not recline - not comfortable for a 10 hour flight. At the back of the aircraft it was hotter than the ambient Fiji air temperature when we arrived midsummer. The food was a warm unrecognizable soft slop consistency. Crew - What crew? After greeting us on the plane and serving us the two "meals" they pulled a disappearing act and were never seen again. The crew demeanour was disinterested and rude towards passengers.

### Fiji Airways customer review
This was the worst experience of flying I have encountered. From start to finish the service was nothing short of appalling. Some of the problems were - not notified of a departure time change delayed in Nadi for 10 hrs with no information or assistance provided. No inflight entertainment that worked seats did not recline or had broken tray tables. Over hot cabin temperature causing many passengers to feel faint. Extremely poor service from cabin crew who did not attempt to provide any beverages or assistance. Dirty toilet facilities. Poor food quality which even for a budget airline was below standard.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Nadi through to LAX. Staff members were not interested in customer service nor did they smile at boarding passengers. After a relaxed safety briefing I attempted to use the inflight entertainment many of the televisions did not work. The aircraft was extremely cold and seating area was very cramped. Many passengers became quite alarmed when the air conditioning vents started leaking large amounts of water people had to move seats to avoid getting wet. Furthermore the meal was a cold hot dog bun with shredded chicken and grated carrot. Staff were arrogant unhelpful and seemed to be busy discussing issues in the corner.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Pacific Sun is the domestic subsidiary of Air Pacific. They have serious trouble keeping schedule. In the past 6 weeks friends visiting here in Fiji were delayed one day each trip from Nadi to Savusavu. They had to fly in and out of Labassa each trip a 90 minute drive from where they booked to arrive. My brother was held up for 2 days on the way back to Sydney and one day on the way here. As I write my mother in law is waiting for her flight in Nadi to Labassa she will arrive at 16.30 rather than 11.00 and again a 90 minute taxi ride from where she was suppose to end up. Pacific Sun’s excuses are numerous however it does seem to be factor of poor management and poor discipline. The lack of domestic competition gives them no reason to pick up their game. Fiji needs the domestic service desperately. Don't hold your breath it will probably get worse.

### Fiji Airways customer review
We flew LA to Sydney via Fiji and then Auckland via Fiji back to LA for four flights. The total time delay we experienced on these four flights was more than 8 hours ranging from 1/2 hour to more than 4 hours. The plane was kept uncomfortably cold during the more than 30 hours of flying. The worst part of our experience was that during the transfer of our luggage at the Fiji airport in a very heavy rain one of our suitcases got very wet.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Auckland-Nadi Jan 22. Arrived at Auckland airport to find flight delayed from 2pm until 3pm. An hour later the issue was fixed but we were told there was a more serious problem. At 7pm 4 hours on we were told that connecting passengers were being transferred to the LAX flight on Air NZ. Fiji passengers were delayed until 11pm as a plane was coming from Fiji. Air New Zealand ground staff were handling the issue and did a fantastic job giving out vouchers and helping passengers. We finally took off at midnight – thankful we had paid $300.00 for an upgrade to a very old and tired business class – with a tired crew who were doing an unexpected double shift. The flight was uneventful the food and service OK (but well below what you would expect for an international airline) and the crew clearly tired. Delays and very old and worn aircraft and I would be reluctant to use Air Pacific again in the future.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Sydney to Nadi return. Our outbound flight was delayed 3 hrs and the food was terrible. The inflight entertainment was a selection of movies and the system worked intermittently. According to resort staff Air Pacific have a shocking on time record. The trip home today was no different except it was on time. I did not eat my processed chicken and egg muffin for breakfast. Staff were OK but not like the happy friendly Fijians I met while on holiday.

Sydney to Nadi. There did not appear to be any air-conditioning. It was very very warm from the moment we entered the plane until we got off. The food was very substandard. Service levels have certainly dropped.

Auckland-Nadi. Seats were old but appeared to have been reupholstered. Flight crew very friendly. Meal delicious. The personal entertainment screen was difficult to get out of the arm rest mechanism needed servicing. The choices available were limited.

Although a full service airline we enjoyed a plane 20/30 years old but not the service quality from those days. 2 seats were blocked off due to trim falling off a toilet door bolt taped up with 'do not use' the food looked awful and didn't dare try. LCC service except check-in bags not charged. Overall very average.

Melbourne to Nadi B767-300. We were served a meal as soon as the flight levelled off and it was awful. 3 hours into the flight I asked an attendant for water I had to wait 30 minutes and when I pressed the courtesy light the FA said she would be with me shortly. 10 minutes she appeared with a warm bottle of water with an unpleasant smile. Thirty minutes before landing there was an announcement that the bar was closed. Air Pacific advertises itself as a full service airline however the service on this flight was that of a limited service airline. I have been travelling to Fiji for 22 years and service has certainly declined.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Seattle transfer through LAX to Nadi Fiji. The only airline that flies to Fiji from the USA was Air Pacific and they are the worst. Our original flight going home was 9pm Tuesday - Air Pacific canceled the flight at 5.30pm Tuesday and didn’t notify anyone. We got to the airport to wait in line for over an hour to get our vouchers. The flight rescheduled for 0600 Wednesday and we waited in line for two hours to get rebooked (airport was unorganized and complete mess). Air Pacific agents allowed us to carry on our bags but airport security wouldn’t let us carry on our bags because we were over their ridiculous 7 kg limit – our bags were the right size but a bit overweight 9 kg and 11 kg but we had nothing but original clothes we carried to Fiji! The plane was delayed another 6 hours after we boarded the plane so we de-boarded and waited. Total delayed time of 16 hours plus missing our connecting flights which Air Pacific said they would re-book but failed to deliver on – we worked it out with our connecting airline Virgin America which was great about re-booking us. I highly advise not flying Air Pacific and they are the only reason why I will think twice about going back to Fiji.

SYD-Nadi return both sectors on B747. Staff friendly and attentive but food was inedible. Air Pacific economy catering seems to like processed chicken meat. I suggest people take their own food on the flight. IFE dated and not a great selection of films mostly cheap US entertainment. On both flights my youngest daughter had a defective sound system but staff said that they were unable to rectify the problem.

SYD-NAN-LAX in B747-400 Business Class. While not up to the modern business class standards of Qantas Virgin etc Air Pacific was comfortable and efficient and an excellent cost-efficient alternative to the major carriers. Old style business class seats had reasonable recline and comfort sleep quality was quite good. Food and IFE are sub- standard but would use again on this route.

HKG-NAD-AKL. HKG-AKL on an old 767 no personalised TV's only handheld 1980's ipads with poor choice. Seats comfortable enough. Service was great plenty of wine and staff ever present in the cabin. Food was mediocre but edible. NAD-AKL same plane same service. AKL-NAD on a new 737 which made a world of difference. Need to update the planes on the HKG route. But Business Class was the same price as Air NZ Economy and we got a nights stop over in Fiji.

Nadi-Auckland Economy on old 747. All seats and fittings are long in the tooth. Food and beverage service was terrible - a sandwich in a plastic bag is not good enough for a full service airline. We experienced heavy turbulence during the flight the Pilot said nothing of the incident and the crew pretended nothing happened. The Tabua Club at Nadi is a sad excuse for a lounge there was toast and a tiny fruit platter. The only good thing is that it was quiet compared to the madness of the wider terminal.

Been using for years to fly from NAN to AKL CHC and SYD both in Economy and Business cabins. Service is still friendly however food quality has been declining. Now it is only a cold chicken or beef wrap but it used to be a full hot meal with a choice of two dishes. This is not good enough for what the airline is calling full service.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Return to Nadi Business Class from Brisbane. Old aircraft with only 8 seats in BC. My seat would not recline at all headsets crackly and distorted. Service was awful my husband and I chose the chicken dish but were told they only carried 2 of each choice and someone had already ordered the chicken. Same with the dessert only one cheese plate available. Tray covers had been used on the inbound flight and turned over to the clean side for outbound flight. Not good for BC. FA's lazy and yawning all the time. All in all a very slack uncaring cabin crew and certainly not worth the extra price.

### Fiji Airways customer review
I have been travelling to Fiji for 20 years the now and then service has changed. The then cabin service was 'Full service' the now service is a sad reflection of the current administration of the airline. The cabin crew can only deliver what is provided . A cold chicken roll and coffee delivered in polystyrene cup is not full service. As a member of Tabua club I use the club lounge at Nadi the food refreshments offered were only one tray of cold sandwiches nothing else. Poor service.

NAN to HNL on 737 aircraft. Served a cold dinner wrap (chicken or beef) on departure with a good selection of spirits and wine. However prior to arrival in Honolulu there was no breakfast offered - just a glass of watered down juice. This could be improved. Previously a delicious hot breakfast was served and it would have been nice to have food at 7.30am in the morning prior to the long customs and immigration wait. Overall friendly staff and great aircraft.

Myself and my wife were flying to Auckland. I forgot my laptop in the departure lounge. Ground staff found the laptop and informed me onboard. On arrival I was met by ground staff and given help the laptop was in Auckland the next day. Staff were helpful and efficient at a stressful time.

Sydney to Nadi return. 747 with old Business seats and small TV screens. Sat in row 1 with plenty of leg room. Although the seats were older there was no horrible "sliding" down when the bed is angled flat. Flight attendants were pleasant and continually wandered through the cabin offering drinks. Lunch was very nice. Return flight check-in and boarding was seamless. Priority tags attached to luggage so it arrived quickly. At Nadi airport staff took all Business/Priority bags off the carousel and had them sitting next to it.

SUV-AKL. The interior of the 737-700 looked worn out and old. Certain films were slightly inappropriate. The food selection was poor a cold burger was served together with small packet of potato chips. Tea and coffee served was not even warm. Water was served after long intervals. Cabin crew were friendly but smiles are not enough to make the flight okay.

### Fiji Airways customer review
NAN-LAX return. Fares were very cheap for this you can't expect much but the seat even though old recliners were comfortable and spacious. IFE was very old (10 channel) loop. Food was fair. Lounge in NAN quite good and lounge in LAX needed improving. A good alternative to travelling the other major carriers in Business from SYD- LAX.

Brisbane-Nandi-Tarawa return. Friendly captain helpful and efficient crew. Food adequate and seconds were given. Aircraft clean toilets ok IFE bit fuzzy but could hear it. Blankets were handed out if necessary. The seats are a bit close. We enjoyed our flight and were encouraged to spread out as flight not full.

Sydney-Nadi-LA return. I had an iPhone loaded with videos in preparation for the failure of in flight entertainment and made sure I had plenty of food. The in-flight entertainment system was lousy (about 1 in 3 work) the food was dated and the seat covers were falling off but for $950 return Sydney to LA I am not going to complain. Read the reviews expect the worst be prepared with food and entertainment and you really won't have a problem. Staff were friendly enough.

### Fiji Airways customer review
On arrival at the airport 0900hrs we got behind a queue of more than 80 passengers and it did not move at all. After close up time at about 1115hrs an agent staff told passengers that the flight was full and all of us who were left behind had to be routed to either SYD MEL or overnight BNE to catch the following night's flight which was scheduled to depart at 2300hrs. The four of us opted for the overnight stay in BNE we eventually checked into the BNE (not NAN) hotel as it was 1445 which was supposed to have been the scheduled arriva of our flight at NAN. The airport representative knew of the change in the aircraft type and was not forthcoming in warning the passengers of the offloading. We were made to wait like cattle in the queue and eventually wasted five precious hours. Our flight was rebooked for the next night with meals accommodation and transport to and fro the airport. Vouchers refreshments were only handed to passengers after the 2 hours wait. Air Pacific staff should have adopted a positive attitude and taken advantage of the situation to provide a high standard of service with proper planning and execution to lessen the already inconvenienced passengers. Service on board was mediocre. With a flight of more than 3 hours from BNE/NAN a cold snack was inappropriate for a scheduled airline which charged international fares.

Sydney to Los Angeles via Fiji. 1st leg of trip with Qantas (Perth-Sydney) was cancelled due to the Chilean volcanic ash cloud grounding flights. We had booked our fare online and it was non-refundable. Air Pacific rescheduled our flight with no additional cost and were delightful to deal with. En-route the flight attendants were friendly and helpful. We observed them dealing with a variety of situations and they displayed professionalism courtesy and appropriate assistance.

### Fiji Airways customer review
BNE-NAN on a 737-700 flight was delayed by over 3 hrs apparently due to a member of the crew calling in sick. Since we had come in on another flight from MEL we had little choice but to wait the 3+ hrs at Brisbane airport. Once we boarded we were given a very warm welcome by the flight crew. The aircraft's condition was satisfactory - not great but you can do a lot worse. Once in flight we were served breakfast consisting of tropical fruits orange juice and a cupcake. I did notice that when the head flight attendant spoke over the PA he would take frequent and long pauses which made him come across as nervous. The remainder of the flight went without a hitch and upon landing in Fiji the flight crew was once again very apologetic about the delay. Overall a nice experience (3 hr delay aside) and very good value for money.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Air Pacific remains the least expensive way (usually) to travel NAD-LAX. But as noted by many others service is only barely adequate. Very few smiles no friendly words. Flight attendants appeared very bored with their jobs. (Big change from several years ago!) Economy seats are very uncomfortable for 11+ hr. (Probably okay for somebody under 30 but not for a mature person.) I don't understand their "requirement" to keep all shades shut as dawn over distant Hawaii can be spectacular and there's nobody out there to peep in! Aircraft interior appears aged with inadequate care. Customer Service (misnomer!) does not answer emailed questions (e.g. anticipated excess baggage limit/cost) despite giving that option. They also lie (or are completely ignorant of) seat selection policies assigning seats months ahead and then denying that possibility at check-in. This airline clearly has a near monopoly on their route (Qantas and Air New Zealand share the airplane and all its elements) and considers passengers as mere annoyances to collecting their salaries. Too bad. Fiji deserves far better.

### Fiji Airways customer review
I have been travelling on Air Pacific for many years mainly because I live in Fiji and the flight schedules of other airlines are not as frequent or suited. Of late I ensure that I have a meal before I board the flight and simply then try to sleep through the flight. This is because the service the meals in particular are unacceptable. Cold sandwiches on a "full service" airline? The fleet is also very old and Air Pacific have dreamt dreamliners are stuck with this old fleet. What that means is that "on our all flights meals and handsets are complimentary" spare us the headsets not worth watching or listening to. Pity that because Air Pacific is a poor representation of what Fiji is famous for - its sunny hospitality.

### Fiji Airways customer review
BNE-NAN-LAX and return LAX-NAN-BN. Worst service ever food atrocious. Smiles nowhere to be seen by any flight attendant. Seemed like it was a chore for them even if you wanted a glass of water. I would never recommend them to anyone nor would I ever fly with them again. It was not even a cheap deal. They were recommended by the Travel Agent - have changed travel agent too.

SYD-NAN-LAX return. First part of the flight was average Boeing 747 desperately needs renovation inside fittings broken sink in toilet smashed electrical and IFE problems stained curtains and upholstery seatbelt and smoking signs burnt out. Seat was quite comfortable and padded there was a flickering light above my seat cabin crew said that they couldn't turn it off. Instead they distributed eye masks but the FA refused to give me one as he thought that the light wasn't disturbing me. Even though I demanded one he refused. The food served was very poor. NAN-LAX flight at 2230 was delayed for 4 hours due to a mechanical fault and we were not allowed off the plane. LAX-NAN the already poor IFE failed to work I called the flight attendant who was rude and she said "yeah it clearly doesn't work does it? then stormed off. She never returned to apologise for the issue that was only with 2 rows of seats. NAN-SYD the same aircraft with faulty IFE and even poorer food. A child in front was disturbing me so I asked to the flight attendant to ask them to stop. She walked off and never did a thing about it. Absolutely disgraceful product and service it is definitely not the World's Friendliest Airline and how it can be rated 3 stars is beyond me.

LAX-NAN-AKL. LAX check in friendly and helpful. Agent changed our seats on NAN-AKL leg as requested. Gave us a coupon for admission to the departure lounge at LAX which was well stocked with snacks and drinks . We flew business class and had seats in the first row of the B747-400. With the seat fully reclined there was still two feet of space in front of us. The business class section was very small for this airplane. Cabin service was friendly food pretty good. Entertainment system adequate. Newspapers available. Transferring from the 747 to NAN-AKL B767-300 involved walking a few hundred feet into the terminal building where our names were checked off on a roster then carry on bags put through the x-ray and hand searched thoroughly. This seemed a bit extreme as bottles of water given to us on the previous flight were taken away from us. This caused quite a bottleneck behind us as most passengers aboard were in transit. Any duty free liquor purchased in LAX and carried was taken by authorities in Nadi. General departure lounge is surrounded by huge duty free shops and business class passengers have separate departure lounge downstairs (no elevator) where breakfast items were furnished. NAN-AKL flight was uneventful.

### Fiji Airways customer review
Worst airline ever. Food terrible service only friendly on the surface. Onboard entertainment worst ever. not even a local newspaper. Nearly could not leave from Nadi to HKG because they told us that we need onward tickets from HKG which is rubbish when you are on transfer to Macao or the mainland. They forced us to buy an expensive ticket to Frankfurt (German passport holder/2000 Euros per ticket one way on a Cathay Pacific flight) and told me I could cancel it at their counter in Hong Kong. The staff refused talking to me and others and just said we would have to buy another ticket (with time running out and only 2 flights per week that are mostly sold out for several weeks). Some couples were left behind since they did not have the necessary funds available to do so. On Spanish couple started crying - can understand. At HKG it became clear that they do not have a ticket counter in all of HKG. They sent me to Cathay Pacific (partner airline) which explained that they are not responsible which made sense since Air Pacific received the money. Contacted the handling agent in HKG (only available Air Pacific contact in Hong Kong) and told me has to send copy of ticket to Fiji and it will take 3 months to refund me.

Nadi to Los Angeles as part of a round-the-world package with Air New Zealand. Paid for Premium Economy but automatically downgraded by Air Pacific to economy. Seats uncomfortable food dreadful entertainment system sub-standard. Worst of all Air Pacific would not honour the higher baggage allowance of Premium Economy so whole trip had to be planned around this leg. Told to confirm booking 24 hours in advance a practice I thought had stopped many years ago. When I asked about an upgrade I was told a 100 FJD rebooking fee was required plus the cost of the upgrade. As flight was an hour late leaving we were confined to a small hot area with no toilets and seating for about one third of passengers for over 2 hours.

LAX-NAN-BNE. I booked the ticket for a very good price at last minute and was not sure what to expect. Check in at LAX the toughest part - I am a professional musician and fly regularly with my instrument I was informed at the check-in desk that I would have to pay $50 USD for extra equipment and gate check the instrument as the flight was full and it wouldn't fit in the overheads on a 747-400. Check in clerk got the manager who advised me they would tag the instrument and if the flight crew deemed it too large than I would have to gate check it. This was great as I never have a problem with any flight crew and I know it fits in any over head locker it's smaller than most peoples carry on bags and very precious to me. LAX-NAN was fully booked and the overhead lockers were packed I did what I do every flight and presented myself at boarding at the front of the line secured my space in the overheads and took my seat we managed to fit everyone's carryon's from the row behind me my row and the row in front in the over head bin. The food was OK entertainment system was awful but I never use them. I did manage to catch a movie when I awoke 3 hours outside of Nadi they seemed to have got the system working by then. Seats were comfortable cabin crew friendly more so than Qantas. Nadi was unorganised with 3 departing transfer flights leaving at the same time roughly with one transfer desk with two staff for everyone. I think the entire 747 was transferring. There was also another security check point after the transfer desk which I thought was strange. NAN-BNE was great on time and no problems on a 737 had an entire row to myself on a 4 hr flight! I didn't bother with the entertainment again as I stretched out and slept the duration of the flight. Got all my luggage with no problems walked straight out onto the street and into the car. Cheap good Service excellent flight crew good friendly cabin crew on time and spacious. Against - charges for equipment despite it being my carry on. Food only OK Entertainment system poor. Management staff at LAX not the best and not that friendly. Will fly with them again if they are the cheapest.

Sydney to Nadi. Would say crew were friendly but need to smile a bit more as their slogan says "the worlds friendliest airline". I had flown Air Pacific several times mostly in economy class but have found some serious cost-cutting. The lunch served was shocking 1 packet of cheap crisp 1 packet of local savoury bhuja mix and a chicken roll on sweet bread which was disgusting. They still charge a high fare price but customer care is very poor.

Business Class SYD-NAN. Seats are very old although we found them quite comfortable for a short trip to Nadi. Service was excellent and food fantastic. Old IFE and very small screens. Great value for money and would fly them again.

Air Pacific economy SYD-NAN-HNL and LAX-NAN-SYD. SYD-NAN on 747 was reasonable. Hot lunch served with beverages. Seats reasonably comfortable. FAs quite pleasant. FAs asked passengers to return seats to upright position during mealtimes which I appreciated. NAN-HNL on 737 a small plane for an 8-hour flight. FAs wonderful with humour and a smile. Food was okay hot breakfast before arrival in HNL. LAX-NAN on 747. Check-in LAX was quick counters opened nearly 4 hours before flight time. Service superb meals a bit disappointing for an overnight flight. Transfer in NAN was chaotic and departure lounge at NAN is way too small. One set of toilets for 4 flights in departure lounge. NAN-SYD standard of service dropped markedly. Crew couldn't wait to get to SYD. Overall we found our Air Pacific experience on 4 flights to be positive.

AKL-NAN-AKL Economy class. World's friendliest airline? We didn't get one smile the whole trip! The one and only smile we actually got was from the Air New Zealand check in clerk in Auckland. B767 terribly old seat was lumpy and had a dip in it so was very hard to get comfortable. Food very poor and not enough. Crew unfriendly and seemed uninterested the whole flight. On the way up there were passengers standing in the cabin talking to each other across the seats drinking as if they were in a pub. Cabin crew did nothing about it. Way back was a surprisingly spacious B737-700. Same as flight up - food disappointing crew unfriendly. Although I am not a fan of Air NZ at all I will certainly pay the extra to fly them next time.

Melbourne to Nadi return My wife and I bought Qantas Business class flights and were given Air Pacific to fly on - had I known I would not have flown The seats were large and fairly comfortable but not up to Business Class standards nothing on the flight was up to standard and I have written a formal letter of Complaint to Qantas as their codeshare partner is well below the business class that I expected. I would only recommend this airline if Air Pacific changed their class to Premium Economy as Business Class is way off the mark in their case.

AKL-NAN September B737-700 clean. Cabin crew indifferent. Cabin Manager friendly and chatty. Excellent welcome on board. Meal was cold and was a hamburger bun with chicken and salad a small pack of potato chips and two biscuits. Vegetarian option available. Free wine available. IFE drop down screens and showing was a documentary. Overall a pleasant flight. Old 767-300 on the way home. Clean and tidy. Continental breakfast was muesli fresh fruit coconut cake tea or coffee and orange juice. Was very tasty. Staff okay. When offering water later on in flight cabin manager flew through the cabin with glasses and water so no opportunity to ask for drink at that time.

Booked a flight from Malololailai to Taveuni via Nadi for part of my honeymoon trip. We checked online the day before to ensure everything was on time and got confirmation that we were good to go. On the day of we headed over to Malololailai only to be told that Air Pacific / Pacific Sun are no longer flying from there. We then proceeded to get a boat and taxi to Nadi but still missed our connection flight from Nadi to Taveuni. Air Pacific told us that they notified us but they did not. We were stuck in Nadi until the next day for the next Taveuni flight. Air Pacific didn't even offer to put us in a hotel for the night. I'm speechless about the whole event. All I can say is if you have a choice choose another airline. Its not worth risking your vacation.

SYD-NAN return B744 Service. Overall an excellent experience. Crew gracious and attentive yet unobtrusive and kept drinks refreshed. The seats are showing their age but I find the old wide and padded cradle seats quite comfortable especially for short haul international flights. AV is poor - not AVOD and screens are so small. Meals were of an economy class standard but served with business class service. For the price - would do it again.

BNE-NAN-BNE Business Class. Flight departing BNE comfortable enough but dated Business Class seats and older plane. Food was excellent and customer service good outward and return. Good IFE with a portable movie player. It seems when things go well they go well but when things go wrong it seems disastrous!

### Fiji Airways customer review
We were a group of 7 flying Business class from NAN-HKG. Upon check in shocked to be told that the flight was cancelled. No one called us beforehand. Total chaos at the airport and apparently there were other flights to MEL and SYD from a day before that were also cancelled due to technical reasons. Total incompetence prevailed and just 1 staff serving a huge line of pax at the service desk. Absolutely no consideration or preference for premium fare pax. Not for all the money would I ever fly this airline again or recommend it to anyone.

### Fiji Airways customer review
SYD-NAN in economy and NAN-LAX in business class. Air Pacific economy is rudimentary and that's putting it politely. There is an extra inch of legroom over most other airlines' economy classes but that's where the superiority ends. One major bugbear was the time it took to collect the trays after dinner - a full two hours after putting them in front of us. Dinner itself was less-than-ordinary pasta made with mystery-meat. Wines were the cheapest bulk-buy available. IFE was a tiny screen with a serious colour-balance and contrast problem but it worked in the front economy cabin unlike the seats down the back. The staff were pleasant and polite but I got the impression they felt intimidated by the passengers. Air Pacific economy is pretty awful. Air Pacific business class is a throwback to the early 1990's but it's much better than their economy. The cabin is in the nose of the 747. Seats recline to about 150 degrees. Food quite good - delicious fried-rice snack on departure from Nadi and a huge breakfast before arrival at Los Angeles. Breakfast was substantially larger and tastier than the offering in Qantas business a couple of weeks later. The FA who looked after Biz on our flight was charming and professional. We arrived on time at LAX and unfortunately we parked at a remote gate so disembarking before the economy passengers was of no benefit. I was happy with Air Pacific biz and for the bargain-basement fare we paid it was great value for money. Economy was not great though which markedly effects my overall score.
