### "do not give them your card"
Not Verified |  Except from the fact that the leg room is really tight. A week later I received three different charges at my credit card, but did not bought nothing more than a bottle of water (which was a different third charge). Be careful and do not give them your card by any circumstances.

### "No regards for customer support"
Luggage was damaged from Entebbe to Sharjah, damaging the luggage handle and wheels. Airline staff was very unprofessional and clueless of procedures. No regards for customer support and rude behaviour. Efforts to approach airline met with equal apathy as the staff also won't help you in case luggage is damaged. Cheap airlines are that way only. It's better to pay some more amount and travel with a good airlines.

### "Pathetic service"
Not Verified |  This was the biggest rip off in my experience. They offered relatively lower price vs other airlines but was still more than double what I pay if I book well in advance. The return flight was super delayed, and I had to book last minute flight on qatar airways which increased my cost massively. I was informed I will get the full refund for the delayed flight as well as the connecting flight, but I got not even half of the booking price back. Not sure if it’s transferred yet. I raised it to them the high cost I had to bare because of them, but they totally refused to compensate. Pathetic service.

### "first and last flight with Air Arabia"
Not Verified | Disappointed with Air Arabia – poor service I flew with Air Arabia from Sharjah to Vienna and had pre-ordered and paid for an inflight meal. The meal was never delivered during the flight, even though I had a confirmed order. When I followed up with a complaint, the airline claimed that all meals had been delivered – which is simply not true. Communication was disappointing. I don’t speak English well, so I couldn’t raise the issue during the flight. Still, I expected at least an apology or a refund. Unfortunately, I received neither. This was my first and last flight with Air Arabia. Their service and customer care are below expectations. I will definitely consider other airlines in the future.

### "still waiting for delay compensation"
Terrible service, still waiting for delay compensation 7 months later. My flight was delayed by 5 hours. No staff at Gatwick airport to provide information or refreshments. Terrible service over the phone upon returning. Take weeks/months for a response and still waiting.

### “highly restrictive and unfair policy”
Not Verified | I recently had a very disappointing experience with Air Arabia regarding their ticket cancellation and refund policy. I booked a flight for my brother and paid an extra 200 just to make the ticket cancellable. Later, due to unavoidable reasons, I had to cancel the ticket. Instead of refunding the amount back to my original payment method, Air Arabia held the amount in credit points which is an unfair policy considering I had paid extra for a cancellable ticket. When I tried to use these credits for my own flight booking, I was shocked to find out that I couldn’t use them because the credit was under my brother’s name, despite the fact that both bookings were made from my own account. This makes no sense—if Air Arabia is going to hold my money hostage in credit points, then at the very least, they should allow it to be redeemed within the same account, regardless of the passenger’s name. This is a highly restrictive and unfair policy. If an airline is unwilling to return the money directly to the customer, they should at least provide the flexibility to use it for future bookings, regardless of passenger name, as long as it is within the same account. This experience has left me with a very negative impression of Air Arabia’s policies. Instead of offering customer-friendly solutions, they create unnecessary restrictions that ultimately cause financial loss and frustration for their passengers. I would strongly advise anyone considering Air Arabia to read their fine print carefully before paying extra for a ‘cancellable’ ticket—because in reality, your money might not be as flexible as you think! I certainly won’t be choosing them again unless they make their policies more transparent and customer-friendly. Very disappointed with their refund & credit policies!

### "Better off avoiding this airline"
Terrible experience with this airline. The airplane was badly maintained, the legroom was nonexistent, and we had the worst experience with customer service and staff at the airport. Even if you can find free tickets, you are better off avoiding this "airline.

### "deduct a hefty 50% of the ticket"
The Worst Airline you could ever use. In case you happen to have special circumstances where you cannot travel, is simply taking all your money or forcing you to travel to their limited destinations. I booked ULTIMATUM fair, with free cancellation and refund, but it seems they decided to deduct a hefty 50% of the ticket amount.

### “far behind that quality I enjoy”
Not Verified | Before two years I used to fly with them and it was a pleasant one. Now its far behind that quality I enjoy. Now there is no comfortable space between the two seats. Very difficult to sit if the front seater reclines his seat to mine. Also there is no entertainment option QR code is not visible. Every airlines targets only for maximum profit, not the comfort of the pax. All other things are okay.

### 2Really bad experience"
Really bad experience. I dont recommend at all. They made me pay extra on my hand baggage they even weight the laptop, my wallet and my jacket and all of that happened after dropping my baggage at the counter and they have employees with their hands scale they wait for you just before you leave the counters area. I said to the employee this is the same baggage I came with he just answered no body is following the roles all baggage must be 10K I said even my wallet he answered yes everything.

### "I had a terrible experience"
Not Verified |  I had a terrible experience with Air Arabia. My husband was recovering from surgery, and we planned a holiday, which turned into a nightmare due to their services. Before paying, everyone was polite, but after that, they left my family of 5 stranded. Despite having a hotel confirmation, we were left on the streets at midnight. When I tried to contact them, the response was shocking. They told me to wait until 9 am the next morning for a solution. We had a tough morning without finding a solution. As a result, we asked for our tickets to be changed so we could return home. Dealing with the situation was particularly difficult because my youngest daughter has autism. They agreed to change our tickets but asked us to pay for new ones. However, I have all the proof and all the records, but they just prefer to keep silent. I tried to find a suitable solution no way and the worst is when you go to their office or send an email your case will be handled by unprofessional staff who have no idea what you are talking about.

### "about 5-6 hours delayed"
Not Verified | You can't imagine how bad their customer service is. It was about 5-6 hours delayed, and I was travelling with my 2 little daughters (3 & 6) and they refused my compensation. They even didn't even serve the food for my small daughters. I knew how difficult my day was with this long delay and with my 2 little daughters.

### “Poor service”
Not Verified | Very bad customer service at Trivandrum airport check in, distracting with laptop bag and hand bag, the workers attitude is very bad while reaching the checkin counter and making the travel hectic. Poor service.

### "cancellation policy was frustrating"
I had an incredibly disappointing experience with Air Arabia, one that I would never want to endure again. The lack of sufficient information on their website regarding their cancellation policy was frustrating. Despite their claim of "free cancellation," they imposed numerous hurdles when I attempted to cancel my booking two weeks prior to the flight. This lack of transparency and the subsequent difficulties they placed in my path showcased a profound lack of respect and consideration for their customers. It's deeply disappointing when an airline fails to uphold their promises and prioritize the needs of their passengers.

### "my last trip with this airline"
Not Verified |   This airline sucks. I arrived 59 minutes before flight departure, they refuse to give me boarding pass and make me pay 40$ extra to get my boarding pass, plus I don’t have luggage. I had only a small carry on of 8lbs they charged me 70$ for it, that was my last trip with this airline.

### "really liked everything"
Not Verified |   I really liked everything! The pilot's voice is very pleasant and friendly. The stewardesses Fiza and Ameni Atef are very attentive and caring. I spent a most memorable and comfortable flight, flying out of Almaty to Medina. Atef, Fiza, Ameni was most helpful and hospitable.

### "I was denied boarding"
On Jan 7th 2024, I had a connecting flight through Istanbul, and upon reaching Bangalore airport, I was denied boarding for my Air Arabia flight from Bangalore to Sharjah then Sharjah to Istanbul because I did not have a transit visa to transit in Istanbul. According to the information available on the Istanbul visa website and other reliable sources, a transit visa was not required for my specific case as I told in the ticket counter that I do not have check-in luggage and I do not need to leave the airport. It was a very bad experience. Do not take this airline.

### "asked the stewardess for help"
My mother is 85 years old and flies alone without problems but having some difficulty opening the water bottle she asked the stewardess for help who refused. Shame! Mia madre ha 85 anni e vola da sola senza problemi ma avendo qualche difficoltà ad aprire la bottiglia dell'acqua ha chiesto aiuto alla hostess che si è rifiutata. Vergogna!

### "the worst airline"
I did not have problem while going from Abu Dhabi to Ahmedabad. My wife got free wheel chair. While Coming from Ahmedabad, we were told that wheel chair is not free, I will have to pay for wheel chair. I thought, my wife is handicap and will get wheel chair at Abu Dhabi Airport, but there also she did not get. Our plane of Air Arabia took off 90 minutes late at Ahmedabad Airport on 19th Feb. So there was only 90 minutes left to catch Etihad plane at Abu Dhabi airport. My wife could not walk, and we had to change the terminal and walking distance was more than 1 mile. I requested Etihad employees to help for wheel chair, but they told me that I have to pay for the wheel chair. Etihad planw was waiting for us, Luckily, one manager from airport called to bring wheel chair for my wife as he might have received the same information for missing passengers. Air Arabia is the worst airline I have ever experienced in my life.

### "It was my worst experience"
It was my worst experience. My first try of air Arabia and it will be my last. Bad experience not good for traveling with baby. They took our hand bags and baby travel trolley and kept telling us its company policy. I asked to show me the policy they refused. We bought a travel stroller for the baby specifically for the comfort of our baby and respecting the airline rules, still they refuse to let it in. The flight attendant the guy was like, make review like who cares. I never felt so disrespected like this time. Never recommend this airline

### "I would never travel Air Arabia again"
3 weeks after a complaint and no response from the airline which would only mean they condone with this conduct or even train their staff to act accordingly. I checked into Flight G9503; the experience was pleasant and smooth. I reported at the gate well ahead of time and waited while enjoying a cup of coffee and a slice of cake. Boarding time approached and passed by with not so much of a murmur as to why there was a slight delay. This did not cause any problem as the aircraft was in sight and nothing seemed amiss. Finally, boarding started and there seemed to be a plan in place as passengers were requested to board according to their seat rows. I felt the girl at the gate was checking this and it did not bother me as I comfortably awaited my turn which turned out to be the last call. The wait on the sky bridge seemed unusually long and when I got to the door I waited till the Purser fruitlessly tried to tell a couple that they would do their best to sit them together. Do we all not know that it is a budget airline and we pay for our seats if we have requirements? Did the purser not know how to handle this more quickly without delaying the aircraft further? At my seat, I found the bins full. This is when a male cabin crew managed to humiliate and accuse me. He directed me to move to the back of the cabin and place my bag there to which I refused. I had paid to bring in my bag and if they had no control of passengers at the back putting bags in front for convenience it was not my problem. His next comment was that if I wanted to put my bag in front I should have boarded first. I did tell him that it was their boarding procedure that hindered me from alighting the plane earlier to which he said well other people came on. He directly pointed out that it was my fault and would not stop accusing me. I do not buy a ticket on an airline to be humiliated by an attendant. I did find a spot a few seats in front of me and placed it there. Was that so difficult to show me that without pretending to be an authority and creating some onboard entertainment? He would be the reason I would never travel Air Arabia again.

### "must hold the Umrah visa to travel"
I suffer with loss because of incomplete information. While selecting destination or airport they should highlight the required terms which are compulsory to travel. As we was traveling from Sharjah airport to Jeddah and we booked online tickets and when we reached airport we get to know that we must hold the Umrah visa to travel instead of multi entry visa we are holding. With this attitude I realize Air Arabia main purpose is only to earn money not provide service. When i call them for refund they don’t have policy to refund the amount. They can only provide the wallet amount which is valid for a year only. At least they should make there first priority customer service. Anyway it’s a really awful experience.

### “I was very disappointed”
Not Verified |  I booked for my first time and will be the last one for sure a flight with Air Arabia from Geneva, Switzerland to Casablanca, Morocco. The  plane had a delay of 2 hours as usual so I lost my second flight in Casablanca which made me loose more than 250 swiss franc (+250 us dollars for hotel, taxi, train, bus, food etc) I arrived to my destination very tired and sick, I contacted the "client service" on Air Arabia app to refund me but no result, the client is nothing for this company. I also booked a dinner which was very bad food, with no bottle of water given, other passengers had free sandwich with water which was humiliating for me. I was very disappointed.

### "bad information management"
This was a nightmare of a trip! We were scheduled to depart at 16:20 on the Thursday. There was a delay of 1 hour verbally, followed by 1 more hour, then another 1 more hour and continued in a similar fashion till about 9pm. At NO point was an Air Arabia representative available!! Approx. 9pm, and where things were getting very heated by most of the passengers. By 11pm we were told by the Airline representative that we would be given a hotel overnight, and that we should prepare. By this point there was a near riot by passengers, and Amman security (about 25 plain clothes and uniformed) were present to stop any filming of the melee, I myself had taken a video to show my wife what was happening, and I was called forward, had to surrender my passport and was told: "you must delete the footage, and if it appears on social media we will sue you as we have your passport details". Quite an unnecessary scary experience! We were taken downstairs, surrendered our passports and boarding cards, we we then given them back and bussed to our 'hotel' by around 1am. I say 'hotel' but a hotel without a working toilet or running water is not my idea of human normality. The bus trip was full of pushing and shoving, and NO guidance of Air Arabia staff. All the above mayhem would NOT have happened if Air Arabia did 1 thing, been honest with us about an engine issue in a timely fashion. Be Transparent, TELL people what the problem is! PEOPLE will understand, equipment fails sometimes! We were bussed back (no help with loading and unloading of my 4 bags or anyone else) and eventually left at approximately 1pm the next day. A delay of about 21 hours. The entire plane erupted in applause about 3 times on landing, to cries of NEVER Air Arabia again! I for one will never fly with them, and neither will many on that flight and all because of bad information management - silly really

### "Never booking again with them"
It was my first time experience with Air Arabia going from Amman to Sharjah then to Bangkok. The experience was a complete disaster our flight was supposed to take off 20-october at 4:20 pm then was announced there will be an unknown delay we stayed for 6 hours until they announced the flight cancellation therefore we will escorted to a hotel. I immediately cancelled my flight since I saw a big chaos and was informed by email that my flight was delayed until 22-October. To sum up - worst airline dealing with. Never booking again with them

### "airline is a complete chaos"
This airline is a complete chaos. Very unprofessional staff. If any problem occurs during check-on or in-flight these guys ain't gonna help you. They provide no help or solutions to a problem or what so ever plus they are very rude. Do no waste your money because they won't cancel, transfer or even refund you the money for your flight if you wish to cancel it.

### "flight was really comfortable"
Smooth boarding. New airplane and clean. Seat space between rows probably the largest I have experienced in Economy class. Friendly and professional flight attendants. The flight was really comfortable and I’m very happy to fly with this airline. It’s one of my preferred airlines. Excellent value for money.

### “worst customer service”
Not Verified |  The worst customer service. Back and forth with customer service and they stopped answering my calls after they said they had my luggage. Lost and wouldn't reimburse me.

### "informed your ticket is on hold"
I booked the ticket for my mother on 15.3.2023 from Sharjah to Calicut. The ticket was booked 60 days prior to traveling and direct booking from Air Arabia portal. It was with return ticket and my mother already travelled from Calicut to Sharjah 45 days back. We reached the airport two and half hours before flying and they informed your ticket is on hold. They made us to wait in the area for the entire two and half hours and informed the flight do not have seat. The airline is so rude that they do not even care about a senior lady traveling alone and did not in any manner addressed their mistake. They did not even send any notification.

### "a very bad experience"
I would never recommend this airline. It was a very bad experience. The seat was dirty, with chewing gum and other debris on it, and despite informing the hostess multiple times to either change my seat or clean it, nothing was done about it. This was by far the worst travel experience I have had.

### "very terrible experience"
I have had a very terrible experience with my luggage. My luggage was left in Sharjah. When I got to Entebbe airport I was told I would get it the next day and 5 days later nothing yet. It's my first experience using this flight and I'm not sure I will use it again. Unfortunately, I have already booked a return flight with them but after my return flight. Not sure I want to ever use Air Arabia again. I am so disappointed. Then the flight set off almost an hour late from Almaty.

### "positive and very well mannered"
I was on flight G9291 Sharja to Tbilisi flight on 16/4/2023. I found that cabin staff Alexandra was positive and very well mannered. She was managing everything perfectly and it was a great pleasure to watch her go about her work.

### "Helpful cabin crew"
Helpful cabin crew. Wide distances in seating. Clean aircraft. Good treatment. Only point is waiting area in Cairo airport is bad. Professional pilot. Very bad arrival gate (northern airport) due to long time waiting at passport gate, very bad

### "Air India Express is far better"
It is an OK airline, not very good. Timing is punctual. They made a lot of overbooking and asking passengers (including me) whether we can postpone one day. They promised hotel stay with all expenses. I did not accept their offer due to the urgency. Food I booked and got it in fine but quantity is very small. Air India Express is far better I think.

### "I don’t recommend this airline"
The worst airline i booked with ever, it is not comfortable and I booked flight from Delhi-Sharjah-Amman. Delay happened in Delhi but i arrived Sharjah 15 min before departure of Amman flight and it is same airline so they should wait for 10 min. Instead, Air Arabia employee took my ticket and change my flight to another flight after 6 hours and gave lunch and Breakfast vouchers which means nothing for me. I don’t recommend this airline to anyone.

### "delayed with no reason"
Flight was delayed from Doha with no reason given to passengers. However, afterwards passengers were informed this was due to weather. On return from Sharjah to Doha, in the month of Ramadan, music was played by the airline with Muslim passengers having to listen to the music. I was fed up of listening to a love song forever. Eventually after a passenger complained and it was turned down. We were informed it is computerised they can’t switch it off!

### "careless handling of our belongings"
Irresponsible and careless handling of our belongings. They asked me to submit my baby stroller at the aircraft and so I did. However, the stroller that I got at my destination was completely broken.

### "I expect better behavior"
Abu Dhabi to Cochin. The flight timings were great. We were traveling with twins who are one and half year old. One has to understand that traveling with small kids is not easy let alone with twins! Cabin staff first spoke to us rudely because we had left our folded prams on the tarmac as we didn’t have free hands to bring it up since the flight did not have an aero bridge but stairs. I respect rules but there is a manner to convey the message and it cannot be rude! I did not expect her to carry my bags/prams but I do expect some understanding and courtesy. Secondly, when I requested her to clear the food tray so that my toddler wouldn’t make a mess she seemed to have a problem with that too and was sulky when I insisted. Clearly she didn’t get the memo that in a service oriented industry customer is king I would give the person the benefit of doubt had she been new to this but she is the cabin manager and I expect better behavior from someone like that.

### "carry-on bag restrictions are ridiculous"
Air Arabia charged me the equivalent of 50 euros to put my carry-on bag under the seat. This was the same bag that Ryanair, EasyJet and Air Europa all allowed me to carry for free. Air Arabia's carry-on bag restrictions are ridiculous and when I questioned the check-in person, she told me that all airlines have their own restrictions and later that it was not her problem. I wrote to 'customer service' who simply told me that they suggest people limit the amount of carry-on they bring and refused my request to be reimbursed for a ridiculously small carry-on allowance. I got nothing I didn't get on the 3 other low-cost airlines I traveled with except a little green tag on my bag, indicating that I had been properly cheated & could therefore carry my bag on and place it under the seat in front of me, as I did with the 3 other low-cost airlines for free.

### "never will recommend"
I am never flying with this airline again and never will recommend to anybody. I flew with Air Arabia the first time in 2017 and then I left my Pandora under my seat which I bought from Armenia on my way back to UAE. I called customer service several times but nobody was ever willing to help me and just simply said "We found nothing". So that's when I know this airline cannot be trusted or perhaps its crew. 2023 came and my friends decided to book with Air Arabia because it's cheaper so I had no choice but to go with them although I've already warned them how horrible the service of this airline is. We checked in online via the Air Arabia app and when we arrived at the airport, the online check in we did was actually useless as we still had to queue like the others who did not do the online one. They could've put up a separate counter for those who did the online check in like how we have in Dubai. Also, all the crew of this airline looks so evidently unhappy with their jobs that it is reflecting in their service. Getting inside the plane, nobody would even smile or even look at you. I asked a crew to help me put my luggage up the cabin as I am a little short to reach and she said, "You have to help me because I cannot put it up myself".

### "consider flying this airline again"
This review relates to my experiences using Air Arabia Maroc. The website is straight forward to use but I was later frustrated when the system would not allow me to check-in online. I flew from Tangier to Gatwick on 17th February 2023 and found the check-in agent to be friendly and efficient as well as polite and clearly a gifted linguist too! The check-in process was prompt as was the departure. It was reassuring to see that security was taken seriously and several checks took place before boarding. My only gripe was that no provision was made for elderly people, disabled passengers and those with babies to have priority boarding. Some passengers were allowed to take far too much hand luggage while others were strictly controlled. A lack of consistency was apparent. The cabin crew were efficient. Service was based on those who preordered items online. The staff then performed a purchase trolley service. This service was well organised. Full credit to the staff. The seats were comfortable and a route map was used on this A320. Disembarkation was a reasonable affair but the crew were not to be seen to say farewell the passengers and the captain did not make any announcement either. The fare was very similar to that charged by larger airlines. The departure and arrival time was convenient and so I would consider flying this airline again.

### "forced me to pay for extra luggage"
The check in counter staff were rude and slow, and whenever you ask them to hurry up because you're late to your flight they say you should've come earlier. Jeddah to Sharjah they forced me to pay for extra luggage for the handbag i came with from Sharjah to Jeddah. I came with this bag same bag, same weight, why you force me pay for it? Either you pay or you split the weight into two bags.

### "easy process all the way"
Had a really nice flight with Air Arabia. Great seat pitch, comfy seats and easy process all the way. Cabin was perfectly clean and crew sufficiently attentive. It was my first time on Air Arabia but it will not be the last

### "disappointing experience!"
You have a great pilots, that's the only point where I may put 5*. Lets start: the crews are extremely poorly trained, turbulence doesn't give you an excuse to not serve ordered and prepaid lunch or at least to get that poor bottle of water, at least do it once landed. Connected flight...departing delay for almost an hour, crews are chatting, laughing - no one bothered to explain passengers what's happening, unless you ask, next: the passengers walking, standing for almost over an hour and talking loudly to friends or whatever - why are the crews quiet? Again lets go back to prepaid food allowance - why the sandwich was served frozen cold and the Bottle of water 200ml only? Oh these delays. Last year had the same experience, plane arriving late for an hour then definitely will depart with delay, spoiling passengers mood, can you think of those who has short time connecting flight later - why cannot you follow the time schedule. Why SHJ bus driver giving passengers instruction to leave hand luggage outside the plane under rain, my hand luggage bag suiting all the parameters and allowances, what was the bus drivers problem with it? Other luggage I received after a long wait - same Sharjah flight, was full of water inside and arrived unwrapped, can't imagine how did they kept throwing it as all new bottled stuff has been opened, absolutely every single tube opened and leaked out all the liquids. That WiFi even didn't work. $500 ++ ticket, disappointing experience!

### "Really disappointing service"
I had a terrible experience with these guys. Flight came 4 hours due to medical emergency as they said we understood but they didn’t carry none of our luggage. Whole passengers arrived at destination without luggage. It took 3 days to get out luggage that too we were helped by our friends working in Abu Dhabi airport. No Air Arabia staff showed up or came for help. The only response was from call centres we called, they were asking to email Air Arabia but ended up receiving “your situation is handled”. Really disappointing service.

### "does not care at all with their clients"
I booked a flight for next week mistakenly I chose November instead December. Like every one I tried to change the flight both online and by calling. Online my experience was awkward , gives the option to change one way and not both! Phone call, number in Madrid is not working and voice message tells you that . Next level, contacting customer service by email imagine after explaining to them what I have done (online and calling) they have sent to me a link to change the flight which is the same in there official site which is not working and a call center number in Morocco. This is my first I have seen an airline who does not care at all with their clients. My last option is booking another flight but not anymore with your irresponsible Company Cheers

### "a horrendous experience"
I recently flew from Ahemdabad, Gujarat, India to Tbilisi, Georgia by Air Arabia and the experience was so horrible. The ground staff was so rude. I had 30 kg allowance. And, 10 kg cabin bag. I had 9 kg in my cabin bag, and laptop in hand bag. I was trying to add extra baggage from 3 days prior to my flight. There was no option where I could add extra baggage. I called up the call centre, and even the lady was so rude. She told me the flight is booked. I asked her if what If I'm told at the check in to lay for my extra baggage? To which she replied, I don't know. So, this clearly means the flight was not booked and the customer service so nicely lied. This is not the first time it happened. I was travelling from Tbilisi to Ahemdabad in June'2022; and I was faced with the same issue. I wanted to add extra baggage. And there was no option to add. And when I called up the call centre, they said the flight is booked. This is not the way to treat the customers. This is such a bad service! I was holding my medical book in my hand. I told them I have to study in the flight. They did not let me carry the book. They made me weigh my laptop bag and my cabin bag. They asked me to pay for my laptop bag. The airport price for per kg is 1300 inr, which is comparatively eay too expensive than online prices. They clearly only wanted to loot us customers. When I told the check-in authorities about it, they clearly blamed me that I'm lying. I showed them my student residency card, telling them that I'm a student and I need my book. They didn't listen to anything. No airline checks the laptop bag. Yet, they do this to us everytime. I tried explaining them so much, no one was ready to listen. It was a horrendous experience. I would not suggest anyone to travel from this airline. And, especially if you are travelling from Ahemdabad, Gujarat I'd suggest you not to take this airline. The staff is obnoxious and ill-mannered!

### "had to check in his carry on"
Not Verified |  Do not take this airline. We had two small carry ons for our short flight from Marrakesh to Fez, but they would not allow us to take them. My friend had to check in his carry on. The reasoning? They claimed it was a full flight, but we knew that was untrue; upon entering the airplane, the flight was only half full, and there was ample space for baggage in the overhead bins. The people who checking in before us didn’t have this issue. In fact, no one else was asked to do this except for my friend. To top this experience off, our seating arrangement was not honored even though we paid extra to have specific seats next to each other. They were randomly assigned seats totally separate from each other. Luckily the flight was (contrary to airline staff) only half full, so we seated ourselves. When traveling within Morocco, take the train.

### "they asked him for money for water"
My co passenger was suffering from headache. From his frustration since inside flight i enquired about this. So he asked for one tablet just to survive the time of fight .. no one care of this. Then he requested again, the air hostess gave him one tablet, after he asked for water. The strange thing is that they asked him for money for water. Its so strange and disappointing situation. I am so annoyed how they may consider for passengers during emergency/ medical conditions.

### "one of the worst flight that I used"
It’s was one of the worst flight that I used, I made a online checkin and I selected a seat, which they changed it at the time of obtaining boarding pass without my consent, then the family next to me were cleaning and changing the kids diaper on the seat and didn’t consider the cabin crew instructions. The food was served after 2.5 hours to me and they didn’t accept the currency which from the flying location. Very bad service! Shouldn’t choose airlines who don’t care about their customers, even the tickets were costly.

### "rules are made to grab travelers money"
Not Verified |  I booked family ticket from Delhi to Abu Dhabi last year to travel in December. Unfortunately travel had to be cancelled. But came to know that they don't refund the money, but allow reuse the ticket within 1 year. Now came to know that they have stopped flights to Abu Dhabi. And there are number of restrictions to re use the ticket. I think Air Arabia is worst airline where rules are made to grab travelers money.

### "did not even acknowledge receiving it"
I was on a flight from Tangier to Amsterdam, the worst flight I have experienced. A passenger had a health issue and the aircraft had to stop in France for emergency. The flight was delayed by almost 2 hours. I missed my connecting flight, and I ended up booking a hotel stay and a new flight which has cost me an arm and a leg. I also had to re-schedule other travel activities which cost me a lot of money. In total the damage was over 1,200 EUR. I raised a complaint. I never heard from them, they did not even acknowledge receiving it. The form does even accept PDFs (how would you supplement a complete compensation claim!) I had similar problems in the past, once there was a half day delay! Once I sent a request for information and never got a reply! The flight was horrible!

### "don't want anyone to suffer like me"
Air Arabia reschedule my flight for 26th August instead of 25th for returning to London UK. Even they emailed me for information and issued an e-ticket. Eventually when I arrived at Kathmandu airport to fly to the UK. They couldn't find my schedule in the system. It was a blunder mistake from them. After carefully checking at Kathmandu airport then found out the airline cancelled my ticket without my authorization. Now I am still in Kathmandu n couldn't fly back and they don't refund me after their stupid mistake. Even I emailed them 10 times but not replied yet. This is their error and they should resolve it. Please be careful with this kind of airline. I don't want anyone to suffer like me. Customer satisfaction is the priority but they are after only money.

### "I did not like the airline at all"
I did not like the airline at all. Staff was rude, they also charge you for water.? On top of buying ticket and choosing the airline, they cant even show courtesy to provide water. That is really rude.

### "Really atrocious service"
Not Verified |  Really atrocious service, both my flights in the same day were delayed with no solid updates on what is happening. The bus is late and thete are no staff at the gate to inform us what is happening. I personally need to get back to my home in Qatar quick and i do not appreciate all my flights being delayed by so long. Air Arabia really need to get their priorities straight and fix these constant delays. Really really bad. Worst airlines I've travelled on.

### "Worst airline for everything"
Not Verified |  Worst airline for everything. Boarding late for more than 1 hour with no information for bus. Very bad attitude from the staff. Not recommended to anyone.

### "journey was postponed three times"
Not Verified |  The journey was postponed three times, from July 17 to July 18 at eight in the morning, then we got an email by changing the date until six in the morning instead of eight in the morning, so I contacted customer service to make sure that it is a deadline ،because of my mother's health condition, and security problem in Sudan and difficulty of The movement in it and the closure of the roads leading to the airport, the customer service told me that another change will happen, and the flight will be at 6 pm instead of 6 am without any email or sms notification.

### "Only fly as a last resort"
Give this airline a miss, at least in this route. I flew 3 budget airlines on this trip (others were Thai Smiles and Vietjet). Both were far superior on everything from check in to leaving on time (currently 5 hours past boarding time on this flight) to quality of food to keeping passengers updated. Only fly as a last resort.

### "didn't give the food to me"
First time I travel in Air Arabia. In food time I was sleeping. Cabin crew called my name and confirmed my name. I prepared the table for food. I already paid it while booking. But she didn't give the food to me. She gave my co passenger with same procedure. I was so embarrassed as I had prepared table for food. I don't think that it happened by mistake. She purposely done. Please do the needful. It shouldn't happened to anyone further.

### "no refund for the cancellation"
I had a bitter experience of flying with Air Arabia two times, they keep on rescheduling and they are not providing stay or food. Moreover there is no feedback tab in their website. Reply from customer call center and reply mail is a nightmare. There is no refund for the cancellation tickets too and I received damaged baggage one time too.

### "Staff were very arrogant"
Not Verified | Bangalore to Doha via Sharjah. Worst airline, they charged us excess as we had 4 pieces of luggage instead of 2 pieces, totalling less than 60 kgs, as allowed for us (2 travellers). This is the first time an airline is charging extra for the number of pieces, as per our ticket we could carry 60 kgs, and our luggage was less than 60 kgs, still they made us pay at Bangalore airport. Staff were very arrogant, and uncooperative. This is the first and last time with Air Arabia.

### "no refund when canceled ticket to Ukraine"
The company offered no refund when canceled ticket to Ukraine. Just dropped an sms that the flight has been canceled. When I approached them in a couple of weeks, they offered three refund options to choose (exchange the flight to another destination, get a voucher for future use and a refund to the card). I responded to clarify a time-frame, during which I can respond with the destination for the first option. Instead of responding, they just proceeded with the third option (least desired by me). During back and forth communication they refused to acknowledge their mistake and offer any correction or compensation. After all they just stopped responding. To make things worse, today (in 11 days after the last interaction) I got charged again by their company - who knows for what. Now I have to pay additional money to my bank for the chargeback process to take place and wait for 60 days to get my funds back. I believe this is the worst interaction with an airline company that I've had.

### "charged me for insurance which I did not select"
Not Verified |  I just booked today and they charged me for insurance which I did not select. When I contacted them they mentioned that you cannot cancel -  you charge your customer for a service which I will not use. It's really disappointed experience, zero customer service.

### "Worst airline I have ever used"
Worst airline I have ever used. They treat us like we are flying for free. Staff here is very rude to customers and things are not even organised a bit around here. This was totally disappointing and i will never travel Air Arabia again.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. The flight from New Delhi was cancelled just 48 hours advance. When contacted with the call center several times (almost whole day wasted)they offered an alternative flight from Chennai or Trivandrum instead of Delhi, saying both the cities were in India. Imagine, they want passengers to travel to South India first to reach UAE. Then when I explained the customer care representative that it was almost an impossible option he said only flight till Sharjah was available. I requested a transfer, even a shuttle, bus, taxi anything could do as unlike Air Arabia we cannot change our duty schedules at 48 hours notice. The option was out rightly rejected. When requested to reach the higher officials, even that was impossible.=

### "most horrible flight in my life"
Not Verified | This was the most horrible flight in my life. It was a nightmare. I booked a flight from Bishkek to Riyadh through Sharjah with this airline. They boarded me on the flight to Sharjah without a problem but in Sharjah, they denied me. The reason they gave me was that I did not have a QR code on my vaccine certificate and I am required to present an institutional quarantine package booking which I didn't have. I had to spend two nights in this terrible cold dirty airport crying all the tears my body could ever produce. The Air Arabia staff treat people like sheep. I saw them being extremely rude and disrespectful to South Asians who were in the same situation as me. On the third day, they sent me back to Bishkek where I booked the institutional quarantine and bought another fright with Flydubai. Flydubai didn't even ask me for a QR code for my vaccine certificate. Moreover, when I arrived in Riyadh the customs officer did not require a QR code and told me I do not need to quarantine. Imagine my anxiety and despair caused by these incompetent Air Arabia staff. Never in my life, I am going to purchase anything from you.

### "don’t have any refund/cancellation policy"
Such a disgusting service. Never again. Was denied boarding for a flight from Casablanca to Basel on Dec 31 for no reason. The guy at check- in counter just said to me “you can’t get this flight without a transit visa”. A connecting flight to my home country was departing from Basel in just 6 hours (24 hours visa-free transit is allowed in Switzerland for Russian nationals). I tried to claim compensation from the airline. They replied, but with “We don’t have any refund/cancellation policy”, didn’t even apologise.

### "Very pathetic service"
Very pathetic service from Air Arabia. I wanted to change my meal preference. Tried changing online, but before it reach the final step, system encountered error. Tried multiple time and left with no other option other than calling customer service. Call got connected after 17 mins, and the lady kept me on hold for another 12 mins and she hanged up the call just like that. Again tried calling them back, waited for 15 mins to get the call connected. Even this time, the lady kept me on hold for more than 13 mins and came back telling that I need to pay additional. (The amount initially paid was matching with the selected meal). She told this cannot be done.. I would give Minus star for Air Arabia service.. Very unprofessional company.

### "Zero care for passengers"
Total unprofessional services from Air Arabia. Zero care for passengers. Flight got postponed for 24 hrs and Air Arabia doesn’t have any courtesy to update the reason for the change or provide any compensation or not even reasonable discussions (Only response provided is the flight changes are beyond their limit). If it is few hrs we can understand. But how can an airline justify change in flight timing for 24 hrs. I booked premium seats by paying additional amount. And when the flight got changed the new itinerary received removed seat booking just like that and they adjusted the amount as credit. If there is any change in original commitment, being an airline company, it is Air Arabia's responsibility to call customer and inform about the change or removal of some service. Rather they expected customer call them back and the worst part is no one answers the call for more than 40 mins in 2 instances. I would rate less than single star for Air Arabia service. First impression with Air Arabia in overall dealing with customer is much below any acceptable quality standards.

### "my worst travel experience"
Air Arabia is the worst airline. They don't care for the passengers. Boarding is totally un-organised. I travelled on 16th Dec, due to delayed & worst boarding, flight was delayed by 45 mins. When it arrived, aero bridge was not used. Passengers were kept waiting in the bus for 30 mins as all three buses were made to go together. Passengers were jam packed in the buses. After completing the PCR test, immigration (which took 2 hours due to Sharjah's Airport's worst management), the baggage hasn't arrived. It tool another one hour, the baggage was removed from the belt and scattered around the hall. It was my worst travel experience. Will avoid travelling with Air Arabia to the max.

### "Very bad experience2
The worst experience, I have traveled from Sharjah to Kyiv for big celebration the flight was delayed plus i was waiting for the luggage which they told us after one one didn’t come and will be tomorrow as of overweight, i had one kg extra which paid at the airport. When I asked if they will deliver luggage home they said i have to come to the airport again. Very bad experience.

### "didn’t let us get in inside our flight"
Not Verified |  Horrible company. We had the worst experience ever traveling with this airline. They didn’t let us get in inside our flight even we are vaccinated and we have all our documents in law. They didn’t know the rules to get in at Egypt, even with the official website of the Egyptian government says clearly that people with the vaccine can go to Egypt for holiday. We were vaccinated in the United States but they didn’t understand that our vaccine is the same as in Europe and they didn’t let us to take the flight. Horrible attitude from the Italian supervisor and the guy from the counter. This supervisor didn’t speak a proper English and he didn’t help us in nothing. We showed up him the official information from the Egyptian government but he didn’t understand that he was totally wrong with his decision. I don’t recommend flying with Air Arabia airlines. They do the impossible for the customers don’t have a nice time flying with them and they don’t give you proper answers. It look like the people in the counter l don’t even know what they’re doing, besides a horrible attention. The supervisor was even worst. They are not prepared at all. My worst experience flying and I’ve been in more than 55 countries. I hope this situation helps to save you a lot of problems with this airline.

### "unaware about luggage lost procedure"
I am passenger of Muscat to Calicut on 19th September. I have lost my backpack luggage weighting 10kg. As per the request, It was handed over to airlines staff while boarding to flight in Muscat. As they informed i would get the baggage in luggage section. But unfortunately i didn't receive hand bag with my other luggage. There after reached at the destination i complained in the aiport (Air Arabia office). A week passed, no one turned to me with registered complaint. While i called customer care number they were unaware about luggage lost procedure. After connecting then 3 times they shared some contact numbers, which never answered and invalid.

### "they refused to reimburse me"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight with them from Doha to Baku for Sep 17, flight was supposed to leave 09:30 and arrive at Sharjah at 11:30am to connect for the flight to Baku at 13:00 and arrive there at 15:55. They sent me an email at 21:00 the night before( keep in mind my flight at this point is in less then 12 hours) saying that they have changed the flight and I should go online and either cancel or accept the new flight. Here is the catch. The new flight they purposed was leaving Doha on Sep 17 at 18:30 and arriving at Sharjah at 20:30 with a 4 day layover and not leaving for Baku until Sep 21. Naturally this is absolutely ridiculous and I cancelled the flight after which they refused to reimburse me. You see they put you in a situation that you can not accept the terms and at the end stiff you out of your money.

### "Really bad experience"
My flight was canceled and I don't need any credit voucher, I'd rather prefer the amount transferred to my bank account. But they say it's not possible. What am I supposed to do with the voucher if I don't need to travel with them in the next year? It's even more unrespectful and ridiculous that they reply with a copy-paste of the previous email and don't have the time to answer their unsatisfied customer. Really bad experience.

### "they refused a refund"
I had booked with this airline in Feb 2020 before COVID19 hit the whole world. Australia had borders shut since March 2020 till now still closed with no opening date set. My "fully flexible" ticket that was paid at an extra cost, all meals and including luggage for 3 people, A$1,787.11 charged has now been taken from me from this airline with ZERO in return. Travel was booked for August 2020 and they refused a refund. They gave us a credit after countless emails with a expiry date that meant i could not book because we are still within travel restrictions, there is no reasoning with this airline. All i asked for was an extension of the expiry date to allow us to book once borders are open and they declined... over and over again i asked and escalated the matter to their complaints team and they all declined. All other flights were refunded for the family and friends we were traveling with but they booked with ryannair and Iberia and both airlines provided a refunded in full no questions or hassles.

### "same documentation will be refused"
On our first flight from Brussels to Casablanca on Friday 27 November everything went excellent. We had registered our self for the flight and received the boarding cards and delivered our baggage at the airport. We have registered with our valid Moroccan passport and our valid resident cards; they were accepted without any issues at all. We did not get any further notification from the registering team that the same documentation will be refused during the back-flight... On 13 December we had our flight back from Casablanca to Brussels. We had the flight at 07.10 in the morning; we were at 03.30 in the morning in the airport. We have waited until the gates were opened to deliver our baggage and register for our boarding cards, however when we wanted to pass to the gates office to weight our baggage we were intercepted by two Air Arabia agents (one was the responsible of the flight that day and the other was controlling the documents). They refused to let us go to the gates office to deliver our baggage and they stated that our documents were not legal, the same documents that we have used to register in Brussels, our Moroccan valid passport and valid permanent residents cards. We have even double nationality, as we have the Moroccan and the Dutch nationality. When we tried to explain our case to the agents, they became aggressive and started to insult my wife in front of all passengers present in the hall. I went to the Air Arabia office in the floor below but the offices were closed. The agents kept on refusing letting us pass to get our boarding pass while we had a valid ticket and valid documentation, the same documentation that we have registered and used from Brussels to Casablanca. If the documentation was to be refused, then we should be notified in Brussels before even boarding to Casablanca... but that was not the case. The agents were executing police task by refusing us to board, I have registered a complaint at the police office in the airport and the police has confirmed to us that the agents do not have the legal rights to hold us from passing as our documents are valid. If someone should prevent us from passing that should be only the police that has right to. The agents were becoming more aggressive, the responsible as insulted my wife and shouted to her and after went away without giving any sign of presence, time went by and the gates have been closed and the time of flight has arrived (7.10), I could go through and escalate the problem and even prohibit the flight, but because my wife is a heart patient I didn’t want to escalate. My wife became unwell and had problems with breathing due to the stress caused by the agents, I have called for the airport doctor and we have waited for him in the cafeteria. When he came she was already better, he has examined her and confirmed she might flight back to Belgium. I have bought new tickets with Royal Air Maroc to Amsterdam as there were no tickets still to Belgium and we had to take the next flight and could not stay longer because I had to go to work next day. At the gates of the flight of Royal air Maroc, that was going to Brussels at the same time (12.30) I have presented the same documentation to the flight responsible and asked if the documents were OK to go to Brussels and she had confirmed it, when I said that the agents of Air Arabia have refused to let us pass she confirmed that it is ridiculous and there was no reason for that and that

### "Bad customer service"
Sharjah to Beirut. Bad customer service, hidden fees, you end up with headache and extra cost. Add to this the fact they fly from or through Sharjah airport, where passengers are treated poorly.

### "they seem not to care at all about passenger rights"
I bought a ticket with Air Arabia in March for a vacation in Morocco. Because of COVID the flight got cancelled. I requested a cash refund but their call center charges crazy amounts. I sent numerous emails to their customer service only to receive standard reply messages. I did not give up and after some time their customer service center finally answered my messages only to let me know that Air Arabia's policy is not to offer a cash refund for COVID-cancelled flights. They said they only hand out a voucher that has to be used within 1 year. Since we couldn't go on vacation, this is completely of no use to me. Moreover, travel to Morocco is currently forbidden by Belgium. EU regulations clearly state that they are obliged to offer EU passengers the choice of a cash refund, but they seem not to care at all about passenger rights. This is the last time ever I travelled with Air Arabia, and I strongly advise anyone to not do business with this company.

### "No refund policy"
No refund policy and call center 1€/minute even if line busy. My flight was canceled in March due to Covid-19 and they offer me a ticket valid one year that I cannot use because Morocco has been closed for the last 6 months and no sign of near reopening. I explained that I cannot use their ticket because we can't fly to Morocco and they keep sending the same email with the voucher valid one year (now 6 months) and if you call them you never get to speak to someone but I received a 30€ phone bill for the call.

### "This is a pirate airline"
Jouf to Nairobi via SharjahI booked the flight for my girlfriend, was cancelled by airline and 3 months later didn't get no response whatsoever. No one is answering their phones, no e-mails, nothing, they just took my money and went quiet into the dark. This is a pirate airline, this is unacceptable from a company to just ignore customers.

### "refund is nowhere to be seen"
My flight has been cancelled due to COVID-19 regulations. I insured the flight beforehand and asked for a refund. I received three blank, copy-pasted emails where it was clear nobody reads my requests, telling me I will get a travel voucher. After threatening the company with legal action, they agreed to pay me my money back within 90 days. 90 days (a long while, isn't it!) passed a week ago and my refund is nowhere to be seen.

### "shocked at the unprofessionalism"
Not Verified | I'm reviewing on behalf of my friend who I was with through all the stress and money lost by dealing with Air Arabia. In all my years in the travel business I am shocked at the unprofessionalism and sheer lack of empathy for passenger. Their condition of contract and other important information is non existent. My friends arrived through Milan to Cairo on 3rd July. It should have been from Naples but Air Arabia cancelled. Email arrived telling them their flight for their departure was cancelled out of Sharm El Sheikh on the 31st July. Air Arabia offered to go back on the 17th August. Nobody in Sharjah contacted them. My question was how were my friends to survive for 17 days. Another email canceling the flight on the 17th August. Rang Sharm airport who advised that there were no flights coming in from air arabia at all. So looks like they sold the seats knowing they wouldn't be flying in or out of Sharm. My friends had to buy 2 tickets with Egyptair yesterday to get to Cairo to catch a flight. They have to stay in a hotel for 2 nights in Cairo, I had to lend them 2000 egyptian pounds. Through all this their visas had run out and on arrival today in Cairo they were told they would have to pay for the visa being out of date. Air Arabia had the cheek to charge them for the seat increases on the two cancelled flights. This is not a covid problem, this is disgraceful. I live in Egypt and I know AA are based in Sharjah but their agents in Cairo couldn't care less. I'm disgusted at the behavior.

### "avoid this joke of a company"
Had a ticket booked this summer of July 18th 2020. Used this airline for over 10 years only to find out that I dont have a choice but the travel to Morocco instead of postponing until next summer due to uncertainties in regards to corona virus restrictions in Morocco. Company made it clear it was all about their terms and condition and showed no compassion towards me or my family situation. Highly recommended to avoid this joke of a company due lack of understanding for their customers. Furthermore, I ultimately choose to stay behind to be safe than sorry. Paid over £1200 and thats now down the drain. In reality, they only care about the money at the end of the day. Will never use again!

### "model seems to be lying and cheating"
Marrakech to London. I was denied boarding (despite being at the checking counter with my family well before checkin closing) because of overbooking on the flight to Gatwick at Marrakech Airport on 23/2/2020. The Swissport staff were rude and extremely unhelpful and just informed that there are only 3 spaces on the flight for the 4 of us- we were made to run around without any solution provided. The gentleman at the ticketing counter asked us to talk to the supervisor - who we had to find by asking around 5 other agents - The supervisor offered to rebook us on a flight 3 days later, without any accommodation or compensation (for something that was clearly Air Arabia issue - overbooking) which was not acceptable to us. Finally I bought myself a ticket on another airline and came home while my family members went in the scheduled flight. No replies from customer care email for 8 days now. The checkin agents on the ground were extremely rude and focussed on shifting the blame on the passengers rather than finding a solution. Air Arabia business model seems to hinge on overbooking and leaving passengers without any recourse - their business model seems to be lying and cheating. I would give negative overall rating if I could.

### "rude and extremely unhelpful"
On the return trip from Marrakech to London, I was denied boarding (despite being at the checking counter with my family well before closing) because of overbooking on flight 3O105 at Marrakech Airport on 23/2/2020. The Swissport staff were rude and extremely unhelpful and just informed that there are only 3 spaces on the flight for the 4 of us- we were made to run around without any solution provided. The gentleman at the ticketing counter asked us to talk to the supervisor - who we had to find by asking around 5 other agents - finally, we were offered a rebook on a flight 3 days later but without any accomodation or compensation (for something that was clearly AirArabia issue - overbooking) which was not acceptable to us. Finally, I managed to sort out my own tickets on another airline spending own money despite having a confirmed ticket for which I paid full fare with Air Arabia.

### "did not answer our inquiries"
Delhi to Amman via Sharjah. The flight was delayed for three and a half hours and the employees knew and did not inform the travelers except at the gate, and they did not answer our inquiries, and when they started answering, one of the employees who offended his rude manner, his answers, and his reactions to the travelers responded, and whenever we asked him something necessary like your internet service to tell our people Or our work was refusing, and he says this why didn’t matter to me, then we asked for food, and he did not respond yet after 3 hours, and when I asked him about my next trip, how will it be programmed? He did not give me an answer, and then an hour later, he said, often, I will wait for the next flight for each of the passengers who will continue their journey until his arrival. تم تأخير الرحلة لثلاث ساعات ونصف وكان الموظفو ن يعلمون ولم يخبروا المسافرين الا عند البوابة، ولم يجيبوا عن استفساراتنا، وحين بدأوا يجيبون، تصدى للأمر أحد الموظفين الذي أساء بطريقته الفظة، وإجاباته، وردود فعله للمسافرين، وكلما طلبنا منه شيئا ضروري كخدمك الانترنت لنخبر أهلنا أو عملنا كان يرفض، ويقول هذا ليش شأني، ثم طلبنا طعاما، ولم يستجب حتى الآن بعد مرور ٣ ساعات، وحين سألته عن رحلتي التالية كيف ستتم برمجتها؟ لم يعطني إجابة، ثم بعد ساعة قال غالبا ستنتظر الرحلة التالية لكل واحد من الركاب الذين سيواصلون رحلتهم حتى وصوله.هذا أمر غير مقبول، ويستدعي التحقيق فيه، وحل مشكلات المسافرين، وأنا سيلحقني ضرر في أعمالي، يتطلب من العربية تعويضي عنه

### "never use this airline again"
Chennai to Salalah via Sharjah. Worst airline ever travelled, flight delayed by half an hour in Chennai because of that I lost my connection flight to Salalah. Had to wait 10 hours for next connecting flight, didn't even provided a provision stay. This is second time it happened like this with this airline. I'll never use this airline again.

### "No internet, no screen in front"
Cairo to Sharjah was delayed more than an hour. From Sharjah to Dhaka was delayed more than an hour too. No internet, no screen in front. There was food services from Cairo to Sharjah but no food from Sharjah to Dhaka (almost 5 hours), food had to be purchased by cash UAE dirhams. Very rude ground staff in Cairo, Sharjah, Dhaka. They do not consider that everyone pays for his/her own trip, so every passenger must be a valued customer for the airline. I will never travel Air Arabia next time for sure.

### "Pathetic service"
Pathetic service. I was travelling from Riyadh to Sialkot via Sharjah. The first flight was good but the flight from Sharjah to Sialkot was changed at the time of issuing boarding pass and without any prior notification. Total 13 hours extra was spend to at Sharjah airport.

### "never travel by this airline"
Cairo to Sharjah was delayed more than an hour. From Sharjah to Dhaka was delayed more than an hour too. No internet, no screen in front. There was food services from Cairo to Sharjah but no food from Sharjah to Dhaka (almost 5 hours); food had to be purchased by cash UAE dirhams. Very rude ground staff in Cairo, Sharjah, Dhaka. They do not consider that everyone pays for his/her own trip, so every passenger is must be valued customer for the airline. I will never travel by this airline next time for sure.

### "Don’t use them!"
Worst experience with an airline in my life! I had a trip booked for March. Cairo to Istanbul. They emailed me to tell me the flight had been cancelled. I emailed back to ask when I’d be refunded so I could book another flight. I got a response telling me my email had been blocked! I tried the main customer service site and no response to that either. I’ve never experienced this kind of  behaviour from an airline. Don’t use them!! !

### "couldn't recommend Air Arabia"
Not Verified |  Fes to Marrakech. Booked 7 weeks before travel, travel time changed 3 times, last time by e-mail at 18.55 the night before travel. Air Arabia charged extra for luggage. Each time they sent through new flight details, and each time the 30Kg luggage I'd paid extra for in advance disappeared. The last flight time was too late for me to travel, so I took the early train. Air Arabia have refused to refund me, and refused to refund the extra baggage I paid for, even though the extra luggage didn't fly. I couldn't recommend Air Arabia to anyone.

### "told me that my flight departed"
Coimbatore to Sharjah and had to catch the next flight to Riyadh, when I reached the Air Arabia staff for enquiry to understand how should I reach my boarding Gate he asked me to wait through the security check in line to reach the Gate-20 and I did without waiting for a second, when I reached the Gate they told me that my flight departed and when I reached the transfer desk I was treated as if I had missed the flight intentionally. I never expected such irresponsible behavior from Air Arabia staff in a international airport. It’s a complete mismanagement and pushing the blame on the passenger to shift the ticket cost to the passenger where the issue is from Air Arabia staff. Even when I was ready to pay for the new ticket the staff gave me a false information that there was no ticket in the next available ticket, but when I approached SATA they gave me a ticket seamlessly for 900 AED. I was shocked by irresponsible behavior of staff. There were three staff in the transfer desk counter a female staff and two male staff who all were rude and were repeatedly blaming me for the delay rather understanding that I was made to wait in the que by the AirArabia staff.

### "overcharged 60 euros at airport"
Casablanca to Tunis. Bad service, overcharged 60 euros at the airport for no reason, staff would not let us board the plane until we pay the 60 euros which they poorly explained was because we were "late" even though 2 other groups of passengers were allowed to board while we were there. The plane was then delayed for over an hour. We paid for additional meals when booking, we never got those, and the cabin crew ignored our requests and our proof of order, we were then presented a menu telling us we have to pay again to get food. They ignored our official complaint on their website.

### "have never encountered an airline so incompetent"
Not Verified |  I am writing this with complete dismay, disappointment, shock, helplessness, and utter anger. If you know what is good for you, avoid this airline at all costs. I have dreamed of a Morocco trip since 2005. This trip is a lifelong dream. I've booked multiple flights in and around Morocco for October to November. In a span of several weeks, almost each single flight has been moved and re-scheduled. The last straw was when I received an email today notifying a flight change that will mean losing 2 days in Morocco and completely ruining the entire itinerary and losing some paid transfers and tours in the process. I am in complete disbelief as I have been traveling for 28 years and have never encountered an airline so incompetent. They have removed every single way to reach them. All emails are automated, you cannot contact anyone through email, and the number they gave to call is also not in service. I feel so helpless and our trip has been single-handedly ruined by Air Arabia even before it began. I have lost all hope and excitement for this trip and even if I somehow manage to find a way to adjust our itinerary, it will still not recover a portion of the trip that has already been paid for. This company should be banned because all reviews here have a horror story of their own.

### "you have absolutely zero rights"
6 hours delay from Fez to Gatwick and zero compensation. Reason is that the company not registered within Europe. Avoid because you have absolutely zero rights. Even Ryanair is better abide to European regulation. Avoid avoid.

### "Staff were very pleasant"
Sharm El Sheikh to Amman. Perfectly smooth check-in process, our car seats for the kids were handled without fuss. One bag was 23kg but was not a problem. Contrary to some other reviews, our carry on bags were not weighed. We had a 10kg limit in any case. Staff on the flight were very pleasant. Although only an hour-long flight we were given beef shawarma - extremely tasty. Would use them again.

### "they couldn't care less"
Not Verified |  This was probably the worst experience I've had with an airline. In hindsight, I should have opted for a full service airline even at the premium cost. Our flight was on the 22nd of August, Sharjah to Kuala Lumpur. We paid for seats up-front (in row no. 4) hoping that we'd be able to travel with others who place a premium on their peace of mind and convenience. I could not have been more wrong about this. As soon as I sat in my seat, a raucous, rowdy group of customers walked in and sat right in front of us in Rows no. 2 and 3. At first, it just looked like a bunch of young people who were flying to KL for a good time and they'd settle in after a few hours of in-flight fun. Something told me that this trip was going to be problematic, but I just chalked that up to older me nerves. Drink service started. Our merry band selected a plane load of coffee and Red Bull for dinner to go with some sandwiches that AA provided. Being an overnight flight, once service was stopped, cabin crew switched off their lights. As they say, the party started after the lights went off. The group on the left put on their reading lamps which needless to say is quite jarring and did not aid in anyone falling asleep in a 2 m radius. The group on the right seemed sober and some of them curled up to sleep. The others were high on Coffee and Red Bull so they were fully charged up. I went up to the cabin crew and requested them to ask this bunch to simmer down. It was about midnight UAE time and it is my belief that a paying customer is entitled to his sleep during the flight. To my surprise the cabin crew shrugged and said there was nothing they could do. Apparently, this was a group of 'bloggers' who were invited by Air Arabia to review the airline or its holiday package. The cabin crew supervisor went so far as to tell me to go complain if I wanted to and they couldn't care less. The shenanigans continued late into the night and at this time, my normally docile wife spoke up. We asked them respectfully to tone it down so that we could get some sleep before our onward flight to the next destination; to which we got a casual dismissal and was yelled back at. Cabin crew came to calm down the situation, which was the best they could do. After this incident, their belligerence was unfettered for the reminder of the flight. The laughing and the talking were louder and unbelievably uncivilized. In effect, I paid additional to be harassed by a bunch of low-life thugs aided and abetted by the service provider. We were rendered powerless by an apathetic cabin crew and an airline that frankly does not give two hoots about the rights of its paying passengers. I have been flying Air Arabia since its inception, but I am completely done now. A loss of one customer means nothing to Air Arabia but it is my hope that reading reviews like this would give people an idea of the kind of people they give their money to.

### "charge me for my laptop weight"
Sharjah to Sohag. My bad experience with Air Arabia customer service on the boarding on gate, customer service of staff is zero. They charge me for my laptop weight. I tried to ask about their names they covered the tags. What a kind of customer service.

### "hand luggage was really ridiculous"
Gatwick to Fes. Beware of the hand baggage allowance! They charged me 50 euros for exceeding the maximum of 10kg just by 3 kg. and on the same time the flight was almost empty! I didnt have any other complaints but the whole thing with the hand luggage was really ridiculous! The worst part is when I refused to pay 50 euros, the staff tried to bargain so I could pay 35 euros! Totally unacceptable and unprofessional on the whole. They were actually blackmailing me, without giving me the ticket to board if I i didnt pay for the 50 euros charge. And that was just for 3 kg more! I think rules are rules but when you know that the flight is not really full and you dont exceed the allowance by 10-20 kg, I think it should be acceptable that 3kg wont hurt anyone. I would never recommend anyone book with this airline rather than picking up a more serious one and more professional.

### "better than expected"
Casablanca to Lisbon. I found this airline to be much better than expected. well cleaned aircraft, friendly flight attendants. On schedule too. Very comfortable seats. They sould increase their flights to Portugal.

### "crew friendly & efficient"
Marrakesh to Fez. The domestic check in was handled by Swissport and was efficient. The security screening took about 30 mins. The departures lounge was relatively compact and seating was limited. We were bussed out to the aircraft an A320. The flight took off about 10 mins behind schedule As it was overcast there was limited views of the Morroco on the 50 min journey to Fez. The crew were friendly & efficient and were quick to serve passengers that had pre-purchased food and beverages on the short flight. Air Arabia is a dry airline and no alcoholic beverages are sold on board. We arrived into Fez on schedule. Despite being a domestic flight were were required to pass through immigration who required both the boarding pass and passport. We waited for about 20 mins for our bags to be delivered.

### "the service was very good"
Flew Air Arabia from Sharjah to Muscat (and back to Sharjah) as part of a visa run (UAE visa change). Really liked the cabin crew and on-board experience. Cabin crew were very well presented. A lot of the passengers were non-English speakers and I noticed the cabin crew were very polite and treated all of them with dignity and respect to help show them to their seats and put away their cabin bags. Plane was new, seats were clean and plane had a free-Wifi network streaming movie/TV programme (they called it SkyTime) which I used via my smartphone - it was fast. Bought snacks and coffee on board - nothing special but the service was very good. I am an experienced traveller and I really liked this airline and their onboard experience. I would fly with them again.

### "I enjoyed the flight"
I travelled from Sharjah to Colombo on Air Arabia in June. The flight was full but I was comfortable. The flight was about four hours long. I checked in online but my phone failed so got replacement boarding pass at baggage drop. I enjoyed the flight and will fly them again.

### "I will fly them again"
I flew from Beirut to Sharjah on Air Arabia. Check in was easy as I did it on line. I showed my boarding pass on my phone to get through security. At the gate I changed my e boarding pass to a paper ticket as that was required. Although they loaded a lot of cargo we took off on time. I had three seats to my self and was able to sleep. I was given water and dates which were very nice. I will fly them again.

### "200 riyals as fine for the baggage"
I was flying from Hyderabad to Bahrain via Sharjah,while I was transit to Bahrain at Sharjah airport the ground staff of weighed hand bag & laptop was carrying on cabin then demanded to pay 200 riyals as fine for the baggage. I had no chance to debate with them because of their horrible attitude towards passengers. I suggest you don't waste your valuable time & money by flying with Air Arabia for their worst hospitality & cheap flight tickets.

### "Absolute disaster"
Agadir to Birmingham. Not sure how this airline is allowed to legally operate?? They cancelled flights with no notice and cost us over £500 in additional costs to get to destination. They offered no reason, no compensation and ignored most of the communications between myself and them. Absolute disaster. Never again. They need to be banned from operating within the EU.

### "nobody let us know about cancellation"
We bought two tickets from Prague to Kathmandu via Sharjah in November 2018. We were supposed to leave April 13, 2019,  Ten days before the flight we tried to add some food and to change baggage allowance through internet browser. It must be said that their website does not work optimal in any of the internet browsers. We managed to change baggage allowance but no food. From that reason we log out and tried to add food later but we realized we don´t have access to our PNR anymore. We had still ten days to departure so we tried to contact their customer service via e-mail. Till now we do not have any answer. We contacted sales department in Prague by phone and also personally. They proved our PNR with conclusion we had cancelled both tickets in internet browser ourselves and the flight is full. We are still in shock. Two weeks of holiday, year of preparations for our big way to Himalayas, another friend waiting us in Kathmandu, services paid in Nepal are gone. Mainly, nobody let us know about tickets cancellation. If I wasn´t interested about my PNR, I wouldn´t know yet my tickets are cancelled. As proof they just reproduced conclusion of their IT Department in Sharjah. You have no chance to get in touch with somebody from their central agency in Sharjah. Mainly I would like to point out that I do not get any document confirming ticket cancellation. Welcome in modern times full of IT technologies where human being is a poor individual and those big fish use it for making money

### "Never using Air Arabia again"
Mumbai to Tbilisi via Sharjah. Worst experience. I am a student and i was travelling from Mumbai to Tbilisi,I was allowed to carry 10 kg hand carriage. So i had my 10 kgs and my laptop bag. In Mumbai Airport it wasn't a issue they let me pass. Once I've reached Sharjah for transit they started weighing my laptop bag and took my ticket away and asked me to pay fine. Never had such a worst experience. Never using Air Arabia again.

### "Staff seemed disinterested"
Gatwick to Fez. Flying to Fez, the flight was delayed by 3.5 hours and we were sat on the aircraft without a clue as to what the delay was caused by. The staff were disinterested in serving passengers and they would only accept euros or sterling to buy some of their overpriced food items. They forgot to take payment from me for a sandwich I bought and seemed disorganised. They told me that drinks were free on this flight. Flying back to Gatwick - the flight was delayed again by 40 minutes, again for a reason we weren't told. Staff again seemed disinterested. I tried to order a drink and was told to pay for it when on my previous flight with Air Arabia, the drink was free. So there's really no consistency in the customer service you receive.

### "Terrible company"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Fez. Terrible company! Just like it happened to other people, we had an extra luggage but the people at the check-in desk could not see it on the system. We therefore had to pay an extra 50 euros fee on top of the luggage fee paid beforehand through the website. When asked, the lady at the check-in counter said that this happens frequently. So please do consider this if you want extra luggage. For the rest it is overall not better that other low-cost companies that are much cheaper. Would not fly with them again and would not recommend to other people, unless you enjoy being robbed.

### "very poor customer service"
Gatwick to Tangier. Missed my flight in this airline, and another flight was cancelled, contacted them regarding refunds and claiming the airport taxes and duties for the flight I missed, no luck, they never replied to my emails, they not interested at all, very poor customer services.

### "worst customer service"
I travelled with Air Arabia from Dammam to Alexandria. Check in counter took 50 SAR for each extra kilo from travellers. I didn't have any extra weight so I was ok but when I arrived to Alexandria airport, I waited in front of luggage claim conveyor for 90 minutes with 15 travellers but we all couldn't find our baggage. We went to Air Arabia representative and he said he received mail from Dammam and 32 luggages were removed from the plane as they were extra weight. I asked them to send my luggages to home but they refused. Then, I said  we will come to collect but you have to provide us with transportation but they said no. After that, I asked to reimburse me for what I paid but no use. I called customer service many times and every time they said we will talk to you later. I sent 3 different mails but there was no response. Again, I contacted them through their web page at facebook and asked someone to call me but they gave me more than 10 promises but no one called me. They have the worst customer service ever. Their employees are very rude and don't try to fix their mistakes or give a respect to their customers. Again, I have never seen such customer service all over the world.

### "never use this airline"
Kuwait to Kathmandu via Sharjah. The staff in boarding pass counter were rude and didn’t issue my pass until it was 45 min for take off which mean I have to run. This much was fine but at the end of flight in Kathmandu when I collect my luggage i found it was damage and same time I fill up the form for the claim and after a week I got a reply saying I’ll be compensated half of the amount of the luggage. Then never hear from the baggage department. So all I can suggest is never use this airline. We pay for the flight which means we trust them for our bags and everything but all I can say is they doesn’t care. And I’m sure they really don’t care

### "way the airline treated us was awful"
Gatwick to Marrakech. Our flight was affected by the disruptions in Gatwick airport caused by drones. Understandable that unpredictable situations occur, but the way the airline company treated us was awful leaving us waiting on the plane for 7 hours without any water. Later and in the absence of any information we received an email from the company asking us to phone them. More than an hour on the phone at a charge of more than £50 and noone picked up. On top of that despite the company's representative informing us that we could get refund for the cost of the flight if we didn't fly with them and chose other means, the company now refuses to do so.

### "customer service is a joke"
Copenhagen to Agadir. Very unprofessional airline. The customer service is a joke. The announcements in the plane in a broken English where not understandable. If you purchase additional services on the website, they cancel the services included in your rate. In my case, the food included in my rate was canceled because I purchased additional drinks. The plane was not clean and I flew in a early morning flight.

### "probably won't fly it again"
Cairo to Sharjah. When Air Arabia was first introduced as a low cost airline, i wouldn't complain much about quality and service given according to value for money. But that's not the case anymore, they are now charging same like official airlines which are giving much more better service and even sometimes charging more. low cost flights are now the exception as offers given every now & then same like everyone else. - Ground team i encountered least to say were rude. you feel like treated as a low cost traveller while you are actually not. Head of ground team was treating people very bad when arranging the bus to air craft from Cairo airport - No in flight entertainment whatsoever - Leg room is extremely small and you're always touching adjacent travellers which is making flight completely uncomfortable - people are fighting each other all the time because of reclining seat back (due to small leg room) and arm rests without interference of flight attendants - charging for meals & soft drinks - charging for baggage - flight attendants are not so friendly - Air craft smell was horrible all the time Bottom line, either review your fares or upgrade your service Wouldn't recommend and most probably won't fly it again.

### "given such bad treatment"
Baku to Sharjah. The first time flying Air Arabia. I travel so much but no any other airlines given such bad treatment. They give us separate seats to my and my husband both way coming and going. I am lady sitting separated from husband and some unknown men was sitting to near me for whole journey. T We ask them to give same sit at registration counters but the staff was so bad. They are not supporting at all. I never fly with Air Arabia any more in future.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Not Verified |  Marrakesh to London. I had read some pretty bad reviews about Air Arabia however, I was pleasantly surprised. The was an issue regarding checking in - we were unable to check in online but had no problem checking in at the airport. The flight was on time, the staff pleasant and we arrived 20 min ahead of schedule. The was plenty of leg room and I would fly again with Air Arabia.

### "worst traveling experience"
Not Verified |  Ras Al Khaima to Lahore. I have been frequent flyer of Air Arabia. It used to be a good airline. With passage of time, it service has gone extremely poor. First time in my 25 years of traveling I was called back from immigration and my lap top weight was included in the hand carry. It exceed few kilo. I was forced to remove my laptop. I left my bag in the car and travelled. The duty manager did not listen to my request. In fact a smile on his face showed how much non professional people this airline hires. It was worst traveling experience of my life.

### "one of the worst experience"
Sharjah to Goa. This was one of the worst experience. Me my husband and my daughter were travelling from Sharjah to Goa in the month of June. They were supposed to check the baggage weight during the boarding process. No one asked us about the hand baggage weight. After the immigration was completed, the officer stopped us while going towards the gate and said they want to recheck our hand baggage. We had already weighed our luggage in the local  office in Abu Dhabi and they had informed us that the hand luggage is within the limit as they would not check the laptop bags. The ground officer checked our hand baggage, laptop bag, yy Purse and my daughter's laptop bag. He said we have 12 KGs excess bag. Straight away he took the boarding pass and gave to the other officer where there was already a big rush of passengers negotiating on money the officers were asking them to pay in cash, we were asked to pay AED 400. I refused to pay anything for the 2 laptop bags and my vanity bag. They made me and my family stand there for about 1/2 an hour and finally, they negotiated to excuse us if we are paying 100 AED. The worst situation I would not want to travel through this airline again. They are only cheap in service and costly in price.

### "I am very disappointed"
Brussels to Casablanca. I had to pay extra 50 euros at airport for having just 2 kilos more. I am very disappointed. My ticket cost me 200 euros at the start now cost me 250. Totally ridiculous At the end had to wait 1 hour at arrival the get back my luggage.

### "experience was above average"
Air Arabia is a good airline. The airport staff are helpful and always smiling. The aeroplane was in a clean condition. The in-flight magazine is great and the duty-free and SkyMeal magazine had plenty of options and the food was OK. The in-flight entertainment is something Air Arabia must improve on. The pilots made PAs at regular intervals. The seat was comfortable and legroom was better than I had ever seen on a low-cost carrier. The overall experience was above average and according to the money paid, there were more than enough services.

### "Worst of the worst"
Bangalore to Moscow via Sharjah. The total fare was not at all low for the low coster + I had to pay extra for the luggage what is not mentioned while booking and I decided to pre-book my food on 2 international flights. In first place ground staff wanted to offer me middle seat, I had to pursue the ground staff for the seat. The crafts are  really dirty same as the Sharja airport where they land for transfer. Flight attendants are the least bothered about your needs, they just don't care. I requested flight attendants both flights to try change my uneatable meal for something else, but they refused. Worst of the worst.

### "allows no personal bag"
Not Verified |  Marrakesh to Paris. The only airline that allows no personal bag, and makes you check small baggage and then charge you 50 USD for the abuse. No leg room, knees get crushed if over 6ft (182cm) maybe not the worst 3.5 hours of my life, but top 10. I wish that they were in my home country so I could avoid purposely ever using them again, sadly they are not.

### "only allow 3kgs for duty free"
Sharjah to Jaipur. Being Low cost airlines is fine, but how fair is it even ask a passenger to pay for extra weight bought at duty free, after immigration. Just before boarding. I have everything in place. Had a weight limit of 30kgs of check in. But had checkedin only 25 Kgs. Had another cabin luggage for 10kgs. Now after immigration I came to duty free. Made purchases within the applicable limits. And reached my boarding gate as I was getting late. Just before the gate. We were stopped and cabin baggage was rechecked. My duty free luggage was 6kgs & my hand luggage was within 10 Kgs. The gentleman at gate says, we will only allow 3kgs for duty free. No guidelines for this given before. We would have made purchases accordingly. According to air Arabia 10kg + 3kg (duty free), that’s all what they will allow. I had to leave my luggage behind as they won’t agree or willing to listen what I’m trying to explain. Last minute changes. Hopeless low cost carrier.

### "Excellent staff"
Manchester to Agadir. This is the best budget airline, 30 inch seat pitch, comfy seats. Excellent staff. Clean planes. Came on the company by chance. Baggage fees less than some budget airline.

### "claim that I missed my transfer"
Agadir to Copenhagen. I have flown with them on numerous occasions and I have had no problems up until now. My current issue is a minor one as it only pertains to their Airport transfer. I booked their supposed airport transfer from Agadir City to Agadir Airport to catch their flight, it never showed up. Of course I wanted a refund from them for the non-existing service I paid for. Their customer service, which is poor to say the least, only repeat standard phrases such as "no refunds" no matter what the problem is or who is to blame for it. On top of that they still claim that I "missed" my transfer (I did not).

### "never again we will book this airline"
Marrakesh to Frankfurt. Never again: 3 hr delay and finally touch down in Hahn instead of FRA (120 KM away = 1,5 h bus drive). We got this information after arrival even though this was already planned before take-off in Marrakesh (the customs officers in Hahn told us!). My sister was waiting for hours at FRA-airport and she was seriously worried, because she didn´t get any update of this flight. They even switched off the TV screen with our position on the map during the last hour. And no explanation or serious excuse for all this trouble! no further comment and never again we will book this airline!

### "excuse to avoid to help us"
Gatwick to Marrakech. This never happened to me with others airline. Firstly the website they have doesn’t work and doesn’t let you check in. Because of that I missed my flight. You supposed to be there 3h before to do just the check in. We were one 1h before departure and they didn’t let us check in. I couldn’t believe it all the money we paid was for nothing. Then it get worse in the airport they didn’t have help desk so we went to a different airline to see if they could help us. They didn’t know what to say. So we ask for the number of air Arabia and we called them, they costumers service did not know how to speak English. We believe it was an excuse to avoid to help us. This is respectful. Is just business for them. But for us it was work and saving money to take nice holidays. But know all is ruined.

### "had to stay in Shajrah one day more"
Colombo to Kiev via Sharjah. We had planned flight on January 26th 2018, at 4:55am. Air Arabia had an hour delay, so we took off at 5:55am from Colombo to Sharjah. In this time in Sharjah appeared a fog, and we landed at 10:53am in Sharjah and Air Arabia staff members told us that our flight to Kiev took off and we had to stay in Shajrah one day more. We checked our flight to Kiev and we know that this plane took off at 10:38am, so we don’t know why Air Arabia couldn’t stop this flight 15 minutes more. Air Arabia didn’t it, ok, but we had in this same day (26 January) booked flight from Kiev to Poland, we had booked hotel in Poznan and we had booked bus from Poznan to Wroclaw because this is our living place. We told about ours reservations to Air Arabia staff and they said that we must spend one day in Sharjah but next day we will have flight to Kiev and then when we were in Kiev, some person from Air Arabia company will give us airline tickets from Kiev to Poland. Air Arabia staff provided us that we will got a ticket to Poland most certainly. In the same day we checked some flight from Kiev to Poland and we had flight to Wroclaw for 150 PLN for one person, but Air Arabia company provided us that bought airline ticket for us, so we only checked flight options. The next day 27th January when we were waiting at the gate at flight to Kiev after the security control someone form AirArabia looking for us, with whom We went to the Transfer Desk and once again confirmed that we will have a transfer from Kiev to Poland. When we arrived to Kiev, an employee of AirArabia first said he did not know the case, later he told that he knows something, but he cannot help us. If we will know that Air Arabia company fails us in Kiev, or if Air Arabia staff will told us 26th that they can’t buy ticket for us, we will buy cheaper airlines ticket to Wroclaw on 26th January for 150 PLN. In Kiev, we were left without any help, and the employees of AirArabia behaved very rude. We had to buy more expensive airline ticket to Poland.

### "worst flight of my life"
Montpellier to Casablanca. I've had the worst flight of my life. First there was a total lack of communication and customer care. Secondly they lied to us when when we were about to land in casablanca, by saying that the airport Mohammed V was closed, and that we had to wait in Rabat airport to replenish the fuel. in fact it was not closed but there was evident technical problems in the airplane. And finally, they didn't even offer some water to apologize for delaying us by 2 hours and for the other inconveniences

### "very good experience"
Hyderabad to Muscat via Sharja. It was very good experience with the flight. Air Arabia staff was supportive and helping nature. Flight approaches to the final destination within time and the flight was very clean and with the good food. Hope I will travel once again with this flight.

### "I have never been treated worse"
I flew Marrakech to Fez with my wife and had an absolutely horrible customer service experience. I had to pay 40 euros to put our cabin baggage (truly under 10 Kg) in the hold, although it was clearly stated on the website that I was allowed both cabin baggage and an additional underseat bag. Later I saw people boarding the same flight with both of these items. I asked the lady at the customer service desk attending to us in how is she allowing others and on what basis were we picked, she was rude and unhelpful. I have never been treated worse by any airline in all my years of travelling. I would never ever use Air Arabia Marocco again, one more dissatisfied customer to your list, keep the good work with your efficient and well trained staff.

### "Avoid this airline whenever you can"
Marrakech to Frankfurt. Got the information that the flight will be delayed by 3.5 hrs at a time when the flight should actually already have started. It didn't go to the planned destination (Frankfurt) but to Hahn - a 1.5 hrs bus drive away from Frankfurt. But the worst was the handling: Only after 2 hours of insisting and talking to the responsible person the passengers got a voucher to buy some food or drinks - with the value of 5 Euro! Finally arrived in Frankfurt 6 hours delayed at 2am in the night. No connecting trains. No compensation from the airline offered, and it can't be enforced because the airline is not under EU law. Avoid this airline whenever you can!

### "Absolutely appalling"
Flew Marrakech to London Gatwick. Absolutely appalling. I had to pay 50 euros to put my cabin baggage in the hold, although it was clearly stated on the website that I was allowed both cabin baggage and an additional underseat bag. I later saw people boarding the same flight with both of these items. The woman at the customer service desk was rude and unhelpful, I have never been treated worse by any airline in all my years of travelling. I would never use Air Arabia Maroc again even if you paid me. Avoid at all costs.

### "7 hour flight without water"
Worst company ever. They didn’t show the whole the safety video before the flight, and it was not possible to buy even water on the plane when you fly from Morocco to Sweden. I had Moroccan currency, Swedish currency and credit card, but the only payment the accept was euro. So they took my water and my sandwich and I had a 7 hour flight without water.

### "dissatisfied with my flight "
Muscat to Tehran via Sharjah. My first flight delayed about 2 hours and I lost my second flight as the second flight departed just 15 minutes before our arrival. I am dissatisfied with my flight because the second did not wait for us just for 15 minutes (we were about 13 people left behind). I talked to many staff of Air Arabia and all gave me false information. They said do not worry as the second flight will wait for you. For having a rest they sent me to a room shared with 8 people rather than a basic hotel room. A second flight arranged for us for 24 hours later with no any clear explanation. I sent an email through their website but no any reaction

### "Absolutely horrible service"
Sharjah to Baku. Absolutely horrible service. First and the last time I will travel with Air Arabia. They sell you food and its acceptable, but when your kids are freezing and they sell you blankets, you know that they are just there to rip you off. They sell you a blanket for 69AED thats actually worth 20AED in the market. Extremely disappointing.

### "last ever experience of Air Arabia"
I was flying from Colombo to Bahrain via Sharjah with my 8 weeks pregnant wife. Firstly, the flight from Colombo to Sharjah was delayed for about 4 hours which led in missing the connecting flight to Bahrain. Any normal airline would at least provide passenger with correct information. At Sharjah airport (which is another part of terrible story), none of the staff had clear information. The pathetic level of customer care was seen particularly by "Help Desk". I was even given an answer by staff on the desk upon asking when is the next flight "any when!!". There was nobody present at the desk to reserve us a Hotel even. After going around like headless chickens, I found out that the flight would be in the same evening at 5:50pm. I was told that no need to get new boarding pass you will fly on the same boarding pass. At around 5pm, after sitting on chairs at Sharjah airport in miserable and uncomfortable environment, I was given another news. That the flight is actually full and we will be given 2nd priority if the passengers from connecting flight miss this connection. I even noticed that there were passengers who bought this flight on same day, were told by the staff to just "wait and we will call you" meaning they were not let to stand in the queue for boarding. This clearly shows the mentality of the airlines where they have made their money and let the poor people be as stand by. After me literally begging the boarding assistant and explaining him my wife situation, he let us go on the plane and luckily, our luggage was also gone through to be on the plane. I appreciate the help of the guys, but this should not have happened in the first place. It was not my fault that the flight was delayed from Colombo. Even the pilot admitted that it was out of their hands. At least offer us a free meal for goodness sake! The general views of public about airline and Sharjah Airport were quite obviously true. Also, the aircraft is not up to the scratch with other competing airlines in region like Gulf, Oman, Saudia etc. There is clearly a hopeless attitude prevailing throughout this airline management. My first and last ever experience of Air Arabia! I hope I get a refund because I am happy to prove each and every incident that happened in this episode.

### "what a miserable experience"
Tehran to Sharjah. The flight was supposed to leave Tehran at 2:30pm but left at 11:00pm. a different conflicting reasons were given (in Arabic only) including technical problems...etc. Only until we got on the plane did the pilot told us that the fog in Sharjah was the problem. Instead of landing in Sharjah, we landed in Al-Fujairah, 80km away in the UAE. We were not allowed to leave the plane for couple of hours until they released us to the transit lounge which was holding the passengers of another 7 planes. We were not allowed to leave the airport under different excuses. However, UAE nationals were permitted! We had to remain in the transit (literally a barn) for more than 8 hours. Throughout the entire ordeal, there was not a single Air Arabia agent that we could talk to. Bottom line, instead of arriving at 5:30pm, we arrived around 1pm the following day. The airline is very cheap and they will cut cost at the cost of anything happening to the customers. To add insult to injury, after all this ordeal, they would charge you to eat or drink on the plane. Please make sure you don't every give them your business. Pay extra to have a peace of mind and not ruin either you family reunion or your business trip. Interestingly, I learned later that the experience I had was not unique and what happened to us happened earlier and possibly part of a pattern to cut cost (avoiding hotel accommodations or landing at Dubai airport which cost higher landing fees.) The attached photo shows the passengers streaming onto the tarmac and not being allowed to go anywhere. What a miserable experience.

### "never use this airline again"
Alexandria to Sharjah. This is the message that I recieved from the airline on the travel day itself on Dec 31st, 2016 where all airlines are busy. Air Arabia Customer, Your flight G9600 on Sat, 31 Dec 2016 19:45 HBE/SHJ is cancelled. For further info call 0097165580000. And they left us without any other alternative, and since we booked online by card, the payment will be refunded to card again and so we have the flight budget trapped with them unless we have extra money kept aside for booking a better airline. We will never use this airline again, we can never rely on this level of reliability.

### "very poor customer service"
Ras al Khaimah to Peshawar with Air Arabia. Worst experience. First flight was delayed for 5 hours. My return flight was cancelled for no reason without any prior notice. Very poor customer service. Was my first time flying with Air Arabia and will be my last. Would not recommend.

### "cannot take care of passengers"
Multan to Dubai.The flight was supposed to leave at 10:40am from Multan, Pakistan but it took the whole day till 9pm in the evening waiting for our flight to arrive, without any proper information from Air Arabia as to why is the flight been delayed and what actions being taken. They never tell us if it will be canceled or just been delayed. The staff cannot even give any details from Air Arabia from Sharjah in UAE as to whether they will be sending the plane to Pakistan or not. We tried to contact the Air Arabia Sharjah landline and customer service but to no avail.The line is not being attended and only automated reply is what you get everytime you ring them. Air Arabia cannot take care of their passengers. The delays caused us a lot of trouble at work and stress to our family and friends.

### "good value for money"
Sharjah to Chittagong with Air Arabia. Good value for money. Well maintained schedule. Good offers every week. Check in very slow in Sharjah. Seat not comfortable. 1 of the cabin toilets is restricted by cabin crews. As such, there is always a long queue.

### "everything was impeccable"
Sharjah to Bahrain with Air Arabia. The best economy class legroom in a low cost concept I have experienced. Flight attendants very professional, friendly and smiling. Boarding smooth quick and easy. Catering on board reasonably priced. For a low cost airline everything was impeccable. I was with my family and we were very satisfied. I will consider flying again with Air Arabia.

### "offers the best value for money"
I flew from Chittagong to Jedddah via Sharjah and return with Air Arabia. All the 4 flights were nice and comfortable. The seats offered great legroom which is 32 inches. The cabin crews were very friendly and helpful. However the food quality was average. You have to book your meal with the ticket or you have to purchase it on board. Overall I think Air Arabia offers the best value for money.

### "very decent airline"
Tangier to Amsterdam, and Air Arabia Maroc is a very decent airline. Delays with any airline in North Africa are common and therefore I have no big reason to complain. Service onboard is as good as any other and with kindness to the crew who is serving you, smiles and respect goes both ways. Had to pay for food and drinks but it is not a big deal. Prices are fair in comparison with some of the bigger low cost airlines. I hop on Air Arabia Maroc very frequent and my experiences with them have always been good.

### "seats offer good legroom"
I travelled Air Arabia from Delhi to Sharjah, and Sharjah to Doha, flying on an A320. It was not so nice because no food is served, and there is no personal tv. One thing that is nice on Air Arabia is that the seats offer good legroom with a 32 inch seat pitch.

### "very bad experience"
Amman to Kuwait. I had a very bad experience with Air Arabia. The flight was supposed to leave at 1pm and they informed us because of some technical issues the flight should be delayed until 5pm. and no from the company came back to inform the passengers about the status. On the boards we have seen its delayed to 6pm. Again no one appears we called the airport security team to bring us Air Arabia staff but no one shows up. Then they announced the flight will be delayed until 8pm for the 3rd time. Gate changed 3 or 4 times. Company was not clear and keeps ambiguity from the beginning. Although technical issues can happen any time, you have to be clear with your passengers.

### "most economical ticket"
That was my first experience on Air Arabia. I booked for a return ticket from Sharjah to Mumbai. The seats weren't that comfortable but timing wise it was good no delays. NO WiFi or any other sort of entertainment on the flight, but it was one of the most economical and available tickets at this time of the year.

### "not a trustworthy airline"
That was my first experience on Air Arabia. I booked it for AED-1865 for a return ticket from SHJ to Multan. The seats were not comfortable or clean. The most amazing thing is that you have to pay for a glass of water, which is beyond my imagination. Coming back from multan, the flight was late for 6 hours, so from my side I will give 3/10. Not a trustworthy airline.

### Air Arabia customer review
The flight was good, the price of the ticket was low - about AED 900. For the money we paid the service was really good, there are some problems like there is no food provided so we had to buy this onboard the plane. We did not have personal TV and the inflight entertainment was poor but the cabin crew service was good. I recommend if you want a cheap ticket with good service, but no entertainment onboard.

### Air Arabia customer review
Flight G9301 at 14.25 11th October 2014 from Kiev to Sharjah was delayed for 20 hours due to technical problems with aircraft. All passengers were seated at the aircraft during 5 hours without any food at all! We got beverages twice only. During that passengers had to listen to captain's promises about departure every 20 minutes each hour. Before flight cancellation captain told the passengers that the aircraft was fixed and ready to fly but the crew were out of hours. After disembarkation baggage claim procedure was unorganized and horrible. We spent a night at the hotel and departed the next morning.

### Air Arabia customer review
London Gatwick to Casablanca Flight 30106 30105 11/1/2014 18/1/2014. I was very disappointed to hear from the crew that the airline did not supply them with any copies of the on board sky cafe menu or food menu. The only thing we were been offered to buy or eat was a choice of disgusting chicken or cheese sandwiches! During our return and only 20 minutes before landing that my daughter found a copy of the menu under her seat full of delicious hot and cold meals snacks pastries candies and drinks that were all available but hidden from passengers!

### Air Arabia customer review
A320 flight Sharjah-Yanbu (Saudi Arabia) on 16 Sept. Great flight. Check-in was easy and agent offered me a pass to the Biz Lounge for AED 100 with food wifi drinks. Lounge was nice but wifi didn't work - not a big deal. Flight boarded via bus so nice to walk up the plane. Flight attendants very friendly - speaking 8 languages so very diverse. Safety video is the best ever! All done with children so you really want to watch and pay attention. Ordered a turkey sandwich which was large and very tasty. Smooth flight and landed 10 min early. Really enjoyed the airline and flight.

### Air Arabia customer review
30 January to 01 February. Jeddah - Sharjah - Jeddah. Reservation completed online with no difficulty. As a LCC Air Arabia offers free carry on luggage and additional checked baggage for SR 50. Also offered confirmed seat for SR 50. I took the seat confirmation on both legs. Did not take advantage of the advance purchase meal offer nor did I purchase anything to eat on the flights. Inflight entertainment on A320 was suitable for a short haul flight. Seats were comfortable and flight attendants professional and efficient. On board sky sales were relatively affordable but I did not notice any major brand names. Interesting boarding and seating announcements were started while passengers were boarding rather than after the doors had closed. I thought this was a good use of crew time. I have flown Air Arabia Jeddah to Sharjah before and have enjoyed my flights I prefer the route rather than the Jeddah Dubai flight to avoid the hustle and bustle in Dubai airport. All in all a very enjoyable trip.

### Air Arabia customer review
Trivandrum to Sharjah and return. Being a frequent flyer on this route in my opinion Air Arabia is one of the best low cost carriers I have flown. Every time the flights were on time clean and tidy with not so bad seats and leg space. Food available for purchase on board was reasonable and quite good. Overall a very good value for money and a highly dependable airline for sticking on to the schedule every time.

### Air Arabia customer review
After booking my flight from Casablanca to Gatwick one month in advance I discover today that my flight tomorrow has been moved forward 6 hours. Had to get alternative flight on Royal Air Maroc. No reason for alteration of flight time and no help or suggestions. First time I have booked Air Arabia and the last time.

### Air Arabia customer review
Air Arabia from Stuttgart to Marsa Alam and back. Service is pretty much non existEnt and only a major case of hunger made the onboard meal edible. On the return flight takeoff was delayed about 3 hours no information as to why was given to us. As this was known well beforehand we could have remained in our hotels instead of being jammed into the airport at 1 in the morning then finally boarding the aircraft at 04:30 and sitting on the Tarmac for an hour before takeoff. During this time the crew had better things to do than hand out any water or other liquid refreshment it seems. I shall not be flying with this airline again if I can help it and shall recommend to all I know that they should avoid it.

### Air Arabia customer review
Bangalore-Sharjah. Despite leaving at ungodly hours 3.30am in my case this is probably one of my favourite low cost carriers and in my opinion better than some full service airlines that fly from the middle east to India. Plane was clean and service was excellent plane half empty so had whole row to sleep. Since leaving so early in the morning lights are switched off early overall happy with the service Air Arabia provides.

### Air Arabia customer review
CMN-BRU. For a LCC Air Arabia has been a welcome surprise. They offer you 20 kg baggage allowance new airplanes decent seats and a fresh crew. For a price/quality comparison they are better than Air Maroc. But their website is often malfunctioning certain routes are deleted without notice time tables suddenly change and they often leave at ungodly hours. I'm satisfied with this airline and will keep flying them if they keep their standards to the current level.

### Air Arabia customer review
My wife my daughter (infant) and son travelled to Goa by Air Arabia - Dammam-Sharjah-Goa. Air Arabia did not provide the Bassinet for my infant even though it was mentioned in the E-ticket. My wife requested the crew to provide the Bassinet but they did not help her to provide this.

### Air Arabia customer review
Mumbai to Istanbul Sabiha via Sharjah. A320 with comfortable seat TVs on board for entertainment. The crew was polite and patient. After landing Sharjah I had to wait more than 12 hours for going to Istanbul. Airport is small but comfortable. I am satisfied with the services of Air Arabia and the cheap flight.

### Air Arabia customer review
Sharjah to Beirut 55 Euros only. Sharjah airport consistently decaying and becoming more dirty every time. The aircraft this time was quite worn-out and not clean : seats windows. The major complaint would be the absence of free of charge water such as on some other LCC.

### Air Arabia customer review
Istanbul-Sharjah-Delhi. Excellent experience and fare lower than on standard airlines. Well- designed and clear website. Clean planes and polite crew. Food available for purchase of board at very reasonable rate and of good quality.

### Air Arabia customer review
Astana-Sharjah-Astana. Aircraft new clean A320 with all economy cabin. There is no free food but you may choose some sandwiches and drinks for reasonable prices. Food is not good however. However wouldn't recommend to use this airline because of Sharjah airport. The terminal maintained very poorly and very dirty. People sleeping on the floor etc

### Air Arabia customer review
Dep time 9:45pm Mumbai to Sharjah. We boarded the flight and after all the initial talks from the Captain etc were ready to take off. The captain must have noticed some sparks while taking off and he said that we are going to disembark. All the passengers were made to disembark and nothing else was told to us. We sat in the airport take off lounge waiting for an hour. finally after lots of noise made by the passengers a representative from Air Arabia arrived. She tried to convince the passengers but could not give a proper reply. At around 0030hrs the manager arrived and said that a spare part was coming from Sharjah in the morning flight 4:45am and that the flight was rescheduled to leave at 7am. No other compensation was offered to the customers. Some took the offer to cancel their flight while the rest who waited in the lounge were stranded without any offer from Air Arabia. Finally at around 3am after much heated discussion fried rice was offered to all. After that till 7:45am no staff from Air Arabia was present. When they came they again said that the flight was delayed no breakfast was offered. finally after much arguments we took off around 10.30am a long wait in the airport with no compensation! This experience must have made not only me but all the passenger that waited in that lounge dread flying with Air Arabia again. Everyone present there were hoping that Air Arabia would compensate us with something but nothing of that sort happened.

### Air Arabia customer review
Sharjah to Muscat return. Flights departed and arrived on time. The flights have good leg space. Food is not served free.Ideal airline for business travellers who have to fly between the GCC countries.

### Air Arabia customer review
Sharjah to Muscat 2hrs delayed. Muscat to Sharjah 3.5hrs delayed. Bahrain to Sharjah 2.5 hrs delayed. Air Arabia has very bad on timings performance therefore if you go for business trip you should not fly with this airline.

### Air Arabia customer review
Istanbul to Kathmandu and Jaipur to Istanbul I found the service provided by Air Arabia to be efficient prompt and reliable. No delays a fair service onboard (with a good selection of snacks at a reasonable price) as well as a quick transfer and 96 hour visa desk. The only problem is that in the evening (around 9-10pm the airport in Sharjah is crowded with many departures and arrivals. The immigration / security check sections are understaffed for this situation and there can be long queues. Hopefully the airport service will improve. Otherwise a fair mark for Air Arabia both for the service quality and for the good coverage of the Middle East & Central Asia.

### Air Arabia customer review
It's a boon for business travellers who travel regularly within GCC. Excellent flight timings friendly staff on-time departures / arrivals and quality food on board at nominal price makes it ideal in terms of value for money. However the best feature I like of Air Arabia is the convenience of booking on-line from their fantastic web portal.

### Air Arabia customer review
Recently flew from Sharjah to Aqaba to Sharjah for a family weekend in Petra Jordan. Schedule convenient flights on time clean and comfortable aircraft and very friendly cabin crew. On board food can be purchased with a good selection of quality sandwiches at very reasonable prices. Seats have a very good pitch and aircraft on both flights were very new. This airline is expanding in the middle east and I would recommend using them anytime as they are extremely good value for money. Also Sharjah airport much less congested than nearby Dubai. The whole experience resulted in a great holiday.

### Air Arabia customer review
NAG-SHJ. A320 on this sector having television screens for every 3 rows. Earphones cost Dh 10 on board but I advise you to bring your walkman earphones and plug them in. The aisle is at least 7 inches wider than a normal A320 and if one person attempts to stow his baggage in the overhead locker the person behind him can move ahead without any discomfort and there are no bottlenecks. Seat pitch is good and even a 6ft 2ins person can stretch out comfortably.

### Air Arabia customer review
Have flown from Doha to Sharjah quite a few times now and although Air Arabia is an excellent no-frills airline I must comment on the unreliability of the flight times from Doha on 2 occasions I have had to wait more than 5 hours for my 45 minute flight and have had little help from the ground staff. The last time I flew from Doha on the 13th October and the flight was supposed to be 12.50we took off at 6.35.After repeatedly asking ground staff what was the hold up I was told it was "technical" and that it would be sorted in 15 minutes. This went on for more than 5 hours with a whole plane load of passengers wandering around the airport very confused. There is very little trouble at the Sharjah end for departures and arrivals and I just hope that something can be done at the Doha end to avoid any more lengthy delays.

### Air Arabia customer review
For a low cost carrier Air Arabia is an excellent choice to fly within the Middle East and beyond. Fast efficient check-in in Sharjah you can show up at the Check-In counter 45 min. before departure which is impossible in Dubai. Short ways in Sharjah Airport quite hassle free. New spotless clean planes very much on time. I flew Air Arabia 4 times so far to Kuwait two times Beirut and Colombo. Very reasonable prices for snacks and drinks only AED 10 for a large sandwich and AED 4 for a soft drink (US$ 2.50 and 1.00 approx). Very fast internet reservation website quick and user friendly.

### Air Arabia customer review
Following my flight from SHJ-Beirut I flew back yesterday from Damascus. The inflight service was just as good though the aircraft was older. However the check-in in Damascus was terrible with all the line for the three desks merging into one big mass of people pushing to get served. I was waiting for over an hour before I got to the counter. I asked for a window and got a middle seat (they said they had no more windows). I had to wait five minutes before someone could print me out a new boarding pass and eventually I got an aisle seat. I went to clear immigration and was told once i had had my passport stamped that I needed to pay 200Syrian pounds airport tax (mentioned nowhere even at check-in). I had to go back through security to buy the tax then go back airside and push my way through to the front of the immigration queue (I had been queuing at check- in so long the flight was boarding). Once on the plane it appeared that the flight was only half full and I had the entire row to myself so why they could initially only give me a middle seat I don't know. Back in Sharjah the immigration area is confusingly laid out and getting a queue that moves is pot luck. here again everyone is pushing to get served. A nightmare on the ground but great in the air.

### Air Arabia customer review
I recently flew from Sharjah to Beirut. The staff were very friendly and I was given 11A an exit seat so I had a lot of leg room though all the seats seemed to have buckets of space (more than my previous LH economy flight). The pay-food was good value and tasty and we landed in Beirut 30 mins early. The attendants came though the cabin twice with free water. The A320 seemed brand new and was very clean. A great Flight.

### Air Arabia customer review
I've tried flying with Air-Arabia and the fare is cheap. but the problem lies in the passengers well in such an low cost flight one may encounter those passengers that shower only once a week and whose habits are a bit rude or nasty.

### Air Arabia customer review
Damascus to Sharjah with Air Arabia on march 27. Air Arabia is a low-cost airline - never had such legroom at other airlines in economy class. Staff was very friendly and helpful. I can recommend this airline for travelling in the Middle East.
