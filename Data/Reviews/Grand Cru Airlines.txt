### "staff were so friendly"
Had a flight from Gatwick to Zakynthos with Grand Cru Airlines as Small Planet had an issue with one of there aircraft. The staff were stunning and so friendly. The aircraft was one of the best with very good comfy seating. Thank you for getting our holiday off to a good start. Would fly with Grand Cru Airlines any time.
