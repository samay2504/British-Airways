### “A very pleasant flight”
Not Verified | A very pleasant flight. There was an issue with the bag drop, but I had some friendly assistance. The plane left on time and the flight attendants were helpful and friendly. The new plane was clean and comfortable. A small snack was served which was fine on such a short flight. I also appreciated the free beer!

### "you can purchase a lounge pass"
I have flown several legs with Qantaslink over the past 12 months. The Q400 has a more comfortable seat than the new seats in Qantas' Boeing 737-800 and soon to be Airbus 320s apart from their newest aircraft - VH-84A which has seats so hard that a wooden bench would be more comfortable. Ground Service... I'm pretty disappointed that you can't select your seats until 24 hour before you leave (for us less desired Red FF or no FF customers) and all the seats up the front are blocked off for Qantas' preferred customers. Baggage drop and collection has been efficient on all flights where I have checked my luggage. On board, cabin crew do their jobs and the pilots are friendly. Most delayed departures have ended in on time or early arrivals. Food, they may as not bother. I don't consider 3 tiny 20 cent sized corn chips with some sauces a meal or even a snack. I think Qantas and Qantaslink need to do alot better here. One bonus is that unlike Rex, you can purchase a lounge pass with your flight to allow you to relax, have some food or drinks and get away from the crowds before our flights out of capital cities. Lounge passes (unless you're a Qantas Club member or Gold FF and higher) cost $55 - $60. Boarding / disembarking - When they don't use those ramps which are great for people with mobility issues, disembarking is pretty efficient, but when the ramps are used it can take up to 10 minutes for them to put the ramp onto the aircraft. The buses that take passengers to and from remore stands are a safety hazard - if you have mobility or balance issues, then sit in a seat as the drivers seem to be very heavy on the brakes.

### "short but enjoyable flight"
A short but enjoyable flight. Staff were friendly and helpful . Check in was easy and the plane left on time . A small snack was provided, which is fine on so short a flight .They also offered free beer and wine which was a nice surprise!

### "I enjoyed my flight"
I enjoyed my flight. Check in was easy and the plane left on time. Staff were very pleasant and helpful. Food was a small snack and soft drink, which is fine on so short a flight. Overall a very pleasant flight .

### “would like to convey my thanks”
Not Verified | I would just like to convey my sincere thanks to Shaye, Qantas Broome. I flew from Perth to Broome on the 11th June 2024 QF1654 & my luggage flew from Perth to Karratha due to an airport error in Perth. The Qantas staff were very understaffed & my luggage ended up on the wrong flight. When I got to Broome I realised the mistake & contacted Shaye & whilst she herself was understaffed & extremely busy, she found time to organise to have my luggage located, sent back to Perth, then flown to Broome by 10.30am next morning. If all airline staff were as conscientious & genuinely caring as Shaye, then the airline industry would have much greater respect from its customers.

### “a very enjoyable flight”
Departure was on time and check in was quick and easy. The service was very friendly and efficient. They offered a pizza as a meal which was quite tasty. They also offered a second pizza which was generous. It was nice they offered beef and wine. Overall a very enjoyable flight.

### “given some lame excuse”
Not Verified | How pathetic to have no wifi, no entertainment, and no alcohol available in economy but serving it in business.. seriously! Surely on a 2.5hr flight we can have a nice drink if we choose to, and not be given some lame excuse as to why there was none on board but then be offered a soggy, sticky piece of disgusting pizza they had melted into the cardboard box as it was overheated and then gone cold, some "free" snack!! And if all that wasn't an overpriced pain in the butt, you then had to suffer the toxic fumes that filled the cabin on landing! Well done QantasLink.. Not!

### "An enjoyable flight"
An enjoyable flight. It left on time and check in was easy .The seat was quite comfortable for a short flight. The staff were very friendly and efficient. The food was surprisingly good as well. The flight offered refreshments twice. In fact more food then my flight on QANTAS from Sydney to Cairns.

### "A comfortable flight"
A comfortable flight seated in a pair of two seats on the left of the aircraft. The ground service and on board service were friendly and efficient, and we were pleasantly surprised to get a tasty snack and an alcoholic or non-alcoholic drink on this short leg (plus an Easter chocolate). The flight operated about 20 mins late. There was no attempt to enforce the airline's policy on take-on baggage. Luckily we were on early and could find space for our take-on bags over our seats, but other people were struggling due to the suitcase-size bags allowed on board.

### "Not business Class quality"
Not Verified |  Only 1 meal type available after 4 people were served and 2 had the item still available. They could not have cared less offering a snack, no coffee or tea so just had water and nuts. Not business Class quality. She was only interested in 2 of the passengers, standing bottle of wine in hand, chatting continuously with 1 passenger in particular. Worst service and reason Qantas/qantaslink are always my 2nd choice. Plane was filthy.

### "the toilet ran out of soap"
Check in was smooth and friendly. Staff were most friendly and helpful and departure was on time. It was nice that they included free beer and wine too. The plane was a little worn, but OK. My big complaint was that the toilet ran out of soap! This should always be checked!

### "3 flights in 2 days gets cancelled"
Not Verified | After booking a flight to Lord Howe Island over 9 months ago, this week couldn't come soon enough. After 3 flights in 2 days gets cancelled, the airline failed to inform us on their intention to bump us back after we had arrived in Sydney to leave for Lord Howe Island the following day 26/10/22. We were informed around 1pm on the day of the flight that they had cancelled it and had bump us back until Friday. After 4 calls and 2 trips to Sydney airport Qantas desk, they were able to let 2 of us leave Thursday 27/10 in the morning and the other of us leave Friday after (without any refunds on accommodation either). Comes Thursday morning at 1pm and yet again have you guys cancelled the flight. This is the worst experience I have had with an airline and I am still yet to understand why you would bump more people back after flight cancellations, making even more people unhappy. Stop avoiding the problem

### "how they can justify nearly 4 times their normal price"
We have just returned from a trip to Barcaldine. Myself, partner and stepson were charged nearly $1500 per ticket for a return flight from Brisbane to Longreach. Due to a death in the family we had to change our return flight to attend the funeral. Qantas originally tried to charge an additional $1300 to bring our flights forward by 2 days. After several phone calls to Qantas (in the Philippines) they reduced this to $840. I have since checked pricing for the rest of the year. Normally a return flight is about $500. I just don't get how they can justify nearly 4 times their normal price, particularly when the plane wasn't full. Virgin would have changed the booking for free

### "two cancelled flights on the long weekend"
Not Verified |  Had two cancelled flights on the long weekend, which not only majorly disrupted our holiday plans, but also my work. Missed out on a full days work because our flight was completely cancelled on the way home with no helpful alternatives. On the way to Sydney, our flight was cancelled, also with no suitable alternative, so we lost money on our reservation and also in fuel, because we had to drive four hours to another airport in order to be able to catch an earlier flight!? Absolutely ridiculous and it's incredibly negligent of QANTAS link. Completely disrupting our lives and not considering our time valuable at all. For what is supposed to be an Australian airline they do not look after their Australian people!

### "I am still waiting for my baggage to arrive"
One short sector from Melbourne to Devonport, Qantaslink managed to lose my suitcase. Went to contact Qantaslink, told there were 2 other flights from Melbourne to Devonport. Later found out the last flight cancelled, but there was still one flight a few hours later than the one I took. Still no baggage arrived. Under the Warsaw Convention, Qantaslink has to compensate me for the inconvenience, but there is no clear instructions on its website. How many hours have to pass before I am qualified for a claim, how much is the cost for replacing my personal effect. All this information are missing. At present, nearly 24 hours after arriving, I am still waiting for my baggage to arrive.

### "Last time that I book with Qantas"
Not Verified |  Appalling customer service. Booked a RT flight from Adelaide AUS to Nelson NZ to see family for the first time since COVID. Just received an email with a flight change from Qantas for our return flight but they've completely forgotten that we are departing from Nelson NZ - Auckland arriving at 2pm, and booked our departing flight out of Auckland at 6am the same morning. How on earth do we get on a flight that departs Auckland 8 hours before we even arrive from Nelson? Now on hold for 2 hours, no assistance provided. Last time that I book with Qantas.

### "Monumentally bad service from Qantas"
Monumentally bad service from Qantas - flight was over five hours late departing. No information given to passengers and, due to multiple flight cancellations to other destinations, the few customer service staff were unable to cope with demand from passengers. What I witnessed and how I saw some customers treated was appalling. What an ungracious airline and an experience I would never want to repeat.

### "Cabin crew were efficient and friendly"
QantasLink branded flight operated by Alliance Airways. The plane, an Embraer E190 had Alliance markings, but the cabin crew wore Qantas uniforms. First time on an E190, but I'd noticed on the Qantas website specs the seat pitch was more generous than their B737. Between that and the design of the seat, it was a very comfortable cabin indeed. Good space, relatively quiet, smooth flight particularly the landing. The only downside was being a leased plane and not a Qantas own aircraft, there was no Qantas entertainment or inflight WiFi. This scuttled my plan to do some sightseeing planning while in the air to Adelaide. But I was content to play some stored tunes and relax in the comfy seat. Cabin crew were efficient and friendly.

### "refused any compensation or refund"
Made a booking with Qantas Frequent Flyer points on 27 February 2021 for a domestic flight departing 9 April 2021. At the time, the website stated that I had enough points and accepted the booking. The following day I receive an a "no reply" email from Qantas asking to call them about the booking. It was impossible to get through on the phone. The Qantas website continues to show that my booking is confirmed. On the day of the flight, I receive a voicemail asking me to call Qantas. I tried to call back and was still on hold hours later when I arrived at the airport. The customer service rep at the airport advises that I do not have a reservation because I did not have enough Qantas points at the time of booking 2 months ago. I was required to pay over $700 to make an on-the-spot reservation. I've been through the complaints process with Qantas and they have refused any compensation or refund. Abysmal customer service. They need to update their website interface so it can process bookings and reflect their status accurately.

### "will fly QantasLink and this route again"
I have flown this service before. It is a quick flight between the 2 major regional cities in the north approx 45 min flying time cutting down around a 3 to 4 hour drive. There is no classes available and whilst you could select your seat it was on a first come first served basis. The plane was full only a few empty seats so no opportunities to move seats. It is mostly workers commuting between the cities or to connecting charter flights for mining We were slightly late on take off due to the catering being late. The catering company also failed to deliver the alcohol so they made the decision to leave without it. We did however land on time. I can't blame the airline for this but I was looking forward to having a glass of wine. They provided an inflight snack 'manna from heaven' which was a small box of 3 x bite sized snacks very tasty & your choice of soft drink. Considering the flight time was so short the cabin staff did well to serve the whole cabin & do a rubbish collection and then we were ready for descent The cabin crew were courteous and efficient but nothing jumped out to me as a WOW The cabin and seats themselves are very tight and not a lot of room. I would imagine it would very uncomfortable for a tall or large person ( i am only 5 ft ) especially of the flight was longer then 1 hour. The cabin was clean. There is no entertainment provided or wifi aboard but again for such a short hop it isn't needed. I will fly QantasLink and this route again.

### "Lesson Learnt I'll never fly Qantas again"
So what was due to be a 3 hour direct flight turned into a 9 and a half hour day with major delays due to incompetence. Boarded flight out of Canberra for a 9.05 departure only to be informed by the Captain at 20 past there was going to be a delay of a further 10 minutes as they were unable to locate the paperwork for the flight from the previous overnight engineers shift. After this we were then informed shortly later we would be disembarking as the paperwork was not marrying up and the engineers had not completed the routine maintenance that was required overnight. We then boarded a new plane after 1 hr 45 minutes waiting in Canberra for what should have been a direct flight into Cairns as per the previous initial flight. Shortly after take off approximately 25 minutes into the flight the Capitan came over the cabin speakers to inform us that there was a minor technical fault associated with the plane. The flight control tower at Cairns had requested a turn around back to Canberra base, the pilots chose to ignore this and requested a diversion to Brisbane. We were due to land at Cairns at 12.10 however at 11.45am we landed at Brisbane airport at the same time we should have been in Cairns. We were then told we would be required to speak to ground crew for further details although our updated booking tickets all showed a new flight of 12pm that we would cross over too. Each person onboard the aircraft had received the same emails and text messages notifying us of this. Yet off we went to the customer service. We then were informed that we would have to collect our baggage, the flight that was scheduled for us to move onto had been cancelled and we were to re-check in. We were checked into the 3pm out of Brisbane arriving at 5.25pm over 9 hours which should have been a 3 hour flight. Others onboard were rescheduled for a 10pm departure arriving at Cairns at 12.20am in the morning and further more others where told they would not be arriving until around 11am the following day and would have to overnight in Brisbane. Meanwhile many also missed connecting flights to Darwin and also smaller Townships up north on the Queensland coast. To add insult to injury we were offered a $15 meal voucher for our inconveniences. Upon arrival at Cairns we waited for 45 minutes for our luggage to make it from the undercarriage to the conveyer belt. How is Qantas the Spirit of Australia and the so called National Airline it claims to be priding itself in customer services and safety. If I wanted a layover in Brisbane or Sydney and a 9 hour day transiting I would have booked this. I vowed never to fly Qantas many years ago after another awful trip where we missed our connection, Cairns to Sydney, Sydney to Canberra and where told the plane would be held for all connecting passengers, due to incompetence from Qantas ground staff at the Cairns end. We were forced into hotel accommodation that evening. Did we receive an apology from Qantas or any other form of compensation. No. Lesson Learnt I'll never fly Qantas again. I think I'll stick with Virgin like I have in the past with the personal service, the effective communication, on-time running and the professionalism from the cabin and ground crew. Hence I've always been an avid Virgin Fan and frequent flyer. I only took up the offer of the new Cairns - Canberra direct as it was supposedly a direct flight as new to the airline to entice further tourists and also to help businesses travellers.

### "flight was a near-perfect experience"
Our flight time was changed by Qantas at short notice to one that didn't suit us. After hanging on the phone for literally hours I got through to a very friendly operator who willingly transferred us to another flight without charge. Going through Melbourne airport in the early morning in the coronavirus era was a breeze. The QF lounge was not very busy, and while the range of food and drink on offer was less than normal it was acceptable and the service was good. Boarding was efficient and friendly, and an enormous spread was served for breakfast. The seats were very comfortable and the flight operated on time. Despite the change of flight time, this flight was a near-perfect experience.

### "had a great experience"
Not Verified |  Canberra to Brisbane. Cabin crew were very nice. They acknowledged my birthday and made the flight very pleasant. Karly, Marious & Ingrid were very professional and nice. I had a great experience flying with QantasLink.

### "A good flight"
Townsville to Brisbane Departure 13.40. Checkin & boarding online although printed out back up boarding pass . As always Townsville Airport very relaxed feel & friendly staff. This flight the 2-3 seat configuration & we travelled in the seats on the 2 configuration side which is good. We originally had I think chosen 2 seat configuration at back but allocated 2 seats at front which was good I think because the Cowboys Rugby team on board at back of plane sitting as a group. Snack & hot or cold drink served gluten free biscuit. A good flight & arrived safely.

### "very pleasant flight"
Townsville to Brisbane. Check-in was done with ease and boarding was completed in a easy and timely manner. Travelled on the 8pm service and departed on time. As always, a very pleasant flight on the QantasLink 717; smooth, quiet and with entertainment supplied. The food service was acceptable; the serving could be larger, but was not left starving. Cabin crew were polite and approachable. Arrived ahead of schedule, as advised by the wonderful flight deck crew.

### "I’m so over Qantas"
I don’t know where to start with Qantas. If I could, I’d so choose another airline. Due to my work I fly Sydney- Tamworth and return every week. The return flight is frequently delayed, last week by 3hours. The excuses are usually technical errors, sick crew, etc. And when the plane then finally arrives in Sydney with significant delay, the connecting bus usually waits for 15min before unloading passengers. Whenever I raise it with the airline, the usual excuse is “we certainly aim to depart on time”. I’m so over Qantas.

### "it's just not worth it"
Sunshine Coast to Sydney. Whilst the flight was nice, I would only choose it if I was flying on a connecting Qantas flight afterwards as for a 1 hour 15-minute flight Jetstar still has better value for money. Great experience, but for double the price to Jetstar it's just not worth it if you value your money over a small increase in comfort. Seat: Comfortable with plenty of padding and support, but a bit narrow. However, its better than no padding at all (Jetstar). Legroom: Decent, but I wouldn't want to spend long in it, for someone who is 6' 1", about an inch to spare. Cabin Crew: Helpful and polite, very professional and well kept. Kudos to QantasLink there. Food & Drink Served: As a morning flight (6:30 takeoff) a tasty scroll, juicy apple, some berries and a cup of tea were welcome and completely complementary. Aircraft Overall: The Boeing 717 is surprisingly quiet and is overall very nice to be on. As an aviation fan it has some very cool wing views from row 13,14 and 15, but for me I'd say the best are 16 and 17, as they have an awesome engine view. However, if you are not a plane nerd like myself, I would not recommend them as they are louder than the rest of the cabin. Quieter Seats are found forward of row 9. In Flight Entertainment: Whilst on-board WIFI and IFE is free for business travelers, economy passengers must rent IFE at an extra cost. For this flight it was no problem, and the in-seat literature were enough for the short hop.

### "got me on a earlier flight"
My flight from Melbourne to Sydney was canceled and moved to a later flight. Which would mean i would miss my brother's funeral which I'm a coffin bearer. Tamara at Mildura airport check in did her best and got me on a earlier flight.

### "cabin crew were helpful"
Brisbane to Adelaide. QF1957 30 October check in online and only taking hand luggage so quickly passed through security check at Brisbane. As in a previos review I enjoy flying on this configuration plane due to seating being 2- 3 configuration and I had bonus of seat 18c aisle on 2 seater side with the window seat vacant. Took off on time served 3 mini pies and a cold drink. This was a smooth flight and the cabin crew were helpful. Arrived on time in Adelaide

### "sandwich would be preferable"
Adelaide to Brisbane. Checked in online,only hand luggage so quick process at Adelaide airport. Flight due to depart at 16.20 but delayed by about 1 hour. Seat 19c aisle on 2 seat configuration but unlike my flight down to Adelaide with empty seat next to me this was a full flight. Snack was celery & carrot sticks with a dip. To be honest not really worth having & the extra work cabin crew do to serve I'm sure a packaged sandwich would be preferable on the flight with the cold drinks served. We were kept informed of flight altitude of 23000 ft and slower time taking to eventually touch down at approx 19.25pm. During flight cabin crew kept busy due to enquiries about connecting flights. Although arrival over 1 hour late, arrived safely .

### "a pleasant experience"
Cairns to Alice Springs. Actually a pleasant experience. In many ways superior to Sydney to Melbourne business class on mainline. We bought emergency exit seats for a minimal fee and were very comfortable. The attendants were warm and efficient serving a small but tasty breakfast sandwich and a drink. The 2 hour plus flight was on time and well done. Bags came quickly and we were on our way.

### "annoyed with the service"
Very frustrated with Qantal Link/Alliance flights from Port hedland to Perth flights on regularity. I have to travel this route every month and flight around 5-6 pm on regular change and delay. Last month I had 6 hr in the airport and today again 1 hr delay. Why do you fly on this route if you cannot maintain timing. I was big fan of Qantas but now I will hate this airline like all those cheap budget airline. Very annoyed with the service. Customer care took 1 hr in the queue and unable to sort out issue. No apology from customer rep as well. Shame on Qantas.

### "friendly cabin crew"
Townsville to Brisbane. Check in at Townsville Airport quiet no queues and friendly. Flight took off on time. What I like about this flight was the 2-3 seat configuration which is very convenient when 2 people travelling together. Pilot gave out information throughout flight. Hot potato and meat pie, water and drinks from bar. Will mention that my wife who was travelling with me was served a very nice Gluten Free toasted sandwich early into flight & asked  for some tea -the cabin crew member offered to get her one but my wife said she would be happy with water as didn't realise just cold drinks.Very good flight & friendly cabin crew safe flight & arrived early.

### "Crew were inexperienced and abrupt"
Flew Brisbane to Brisbane on Friday 8 December. Flight departed 2 hours late after 4 different notifications by board of delay. Three different reasons provided for the delay. 3 hour wait in the Departure Lounge but no refreshments provided. The Crew were inexperienced and abrupt. QantasLink seems to be adopting the haphazard service of its parent. This is what customers get when there is no competition.

### "staff incredibly helpful"
Flew QantasLink from Gladstone to Brisbane. Food was great, Australian owned and made selections, staff incredibly helpful. Phoned ahead to help me make my connecting flight and got a private car on the runway waiting for me as I arrived. Unbelievable service, delays due to weather put my connecting flight in trouble, I booked this myself and it was my own fault for cutting it close. Qantas went out of their way to help me.

### "Arrived on time, quiet flight"
QF1790, October 22, Brisbane to Townsville. Booked to fly 21 October but got a message flight changed to very late evening so contacted customer service and told original flight cancelled. I asked for the next morning flight and was given that with no extra charge. Checked in on mobile and boarding pass on mobile. Very quick through security but my mobile boarding pass disappeared just before boarding so went to customer service desk and issued with paper boarding pass after being asked for photo ID which is a first at domestic but not complaining. Seat 22c aisle. What I like about this plane is 2-3 configuration. No gluten free meal on this flight but just ask if they have gluten free biscuits and cabin crew have some and drinks served. Arrived on time, quiet flight.

### "I enjoyed the flight"
Hobart to Melbourne. I enjoyed the flight. The departure was punctual and check in and boarding was fast and efficient. The service was friendly and a very tasty and filling meal was provided. The quality of the wine was excellent as well. A lovely end to my break!

### "Cabin crew were friendly"
There was a delay in departure due to late arrival of the aircraft to the airport as a results of bad weather. As a results some of us missed our connecting flights to Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur. Upon arrival in Singapore, a buggy was waiting for us and we were immediately taken to our new gates. We were told that the next flight will be in less than one hour, hence they could not guarantee our luggage would arrive with us. Upon arrival to our final destination, our luggage did not arrive (as expected). We waited for the arrival of another aircraft from Singapore, still our luggage was not delivered. We lodged a report, and our luggage arrived to our home address at 6 pm the next day. Why push us to the next immediate flight when our luggage couldn't 'join' us I wonder? Otherwise the aircraft is comfortable, food was delivered at speed and efficacy. Cabin crew were friendly.

### "Very good flight"
Brisbane to Townsville 21 June. Check in all done online and boarding pass on mobile phone saves time. Boarded 5.25 am with take off on time arriving Townsville early. Full flight, seating 2x3, seat 20c aisle as requested. Very good flight. Only negative on this flight stated you could not have Gluten Free meal request when requesting on bookin, so took my own gluten free nut bar and had hot tea. Other passengers were having quiche tarts which looked quite tasty. Cabin crew busy and Pilot kept us informed.

### "disappointed with the flight"
Adelaide to Perth. We were very disappointed with the flight. We had booked a flight with Qantas and it was changed to a Qantas Link. The flight was on a Boeing 717 plane - fine for flights intrastate, but we don't think they are acceptable for a 3.5 hour flight. There is no entertainment provided. Qantas should tell you when you book if the flight is going to be changed to this.

### "B717 noise levels bordering on torture"
We booked a return flight with Flight Centre from Adelaide to Brisbane April 2017. First leg to Brisbane was with Virgin Australia, an excellent flight very happy with this. On our return trip to Adelaide on QantasLink I don't know why Flight Centre changed carrier! This is what happened - to our complete surprise and astonishment we ended up in an old variant of the Douglas DC-9, a B717-200, very cramped, no leg room but we had to endure the most terrible noise levels bordering on torture. I asked the staff, who were great by the way, if they had any earplugs, she just smiled and said sorry it's very noisy isn't it. So please be careful travelling QantasLink, it's is not what it used to be! Make sure you dont end up on one of these planes you will regret it.

### "In flight service was excellent"
Hamilton Island to Sydney. Check In was quick and easy. There is no business class lounge at Hamilton island but this is not an issue as the check in time before departure is quite short. Flight was a little late boarding whilst the plane was cleaned. Flying a B717 was a first for me but was comfortable and smooth. Qantas had supplied Ipads for the inflight entertainment, although the battery was flat on mine, so I used another. In flight service was excellent. Good view of Sydney on final approach to airport. Flight arrived on schedule and bags were on the belt by the time we had walked to it.

### "excellent service on this sector"
Melbourne to Devonport and return. Smooth flights in both directions. Online check-in worked well, as did the automated bag drop in Melbourne. Both flights were punctual; indeed the return flight operated a few minutes early. Seats are a little narrow but otherwise fine for this short flight. On the outward, late afternoon, journey we got a large and varied snack pack along with a full drinks service (so I snacked instead of snoozed my way to Tasmania). On the return, early afternoon flight the offering was a nice friande with tea or coffee. All in all QantasLink offer excellent service on this sector.

### "The flight was decent"
It was a short a flight from Brisbane to Gladstone with QantasLink. The flight was decent and acceptable. Both the ground staff and the cabin crew were polite. Passengers were served with coffee and a roast beef sandwich. The later was good, but the coffee wasn't. The seats didn't look very good, in my opinion. Finally, these aircraft (Dash 8) are so noisy and they give you a headache regardless of the short time on board.

### "Boeing 717 and I was impressed"
Adelaide to Sydney. This was my first time on a Boeing 717 and I was impressed. I am a large man and usually require a seat belt extension, however, on this plane the belt was long enough for me with a few cm to spare. We also managed to get an empty seat between us which made the flight even more comfortable. IFE was provided via a courtesy iPad with many channels to choose. The inflight snack was carrot sticks, crackers and dip. Seat pitch and width were acceptable for economy.

### "a flawless experience"
Adelaide to Port Lincoln on QF2267 Australia Day for the Tunarama Festival. On this short 50-minute hop to Port Lincoln, the crew of two did everything possible to ensure the passengers on board had a flawless experience. I was surprised to be offered a muffin and a hot beverage on such a short flight. A few days later on January 28, I flew the return leg PLO-ADL home on QF2274. Once again, the crew did a fantastic job, and there was even bar service offered (where I had a beer along with my snack). To top it off, we even arrived five minutes early into Adelaide, where baggage was already on the carousel!

### "Very relaxed flight"
Townsville to Brisbane. Checked in on mobile phone and mobile phone boarding pass. Townsville airport very quiet so very quick bag drop off and quick security clearance friendly staff. Boarded quickly and took off on time Chosen seat 20C, an aisle. This plane was a 2x3 seating configuration so good for 2 passengers travelling together. Gluten Free Toasted sandwich served very soon into flight and cold drinks .Was asked if I would like another snack later when trolley passed again. Very relaxed flight.

### "crew friendly and helpful"
QF1788 Brisbane to Townsville with QantasLink 21 December. Check in on line, mobile phone boarding pass. Early flight 6.55am. Seating on flight 2x3 seating. Aisle seat 20C as selected in 2 seater aisle. Took off on time. Breakfast served Gluten Free large toasted sandwhich very tasty. Cabin Crew friendly and helpful. Good flight. Usually verify review but misplaced boarding pass.

### "breakfast meal was tasty"
Brisbane to Canberra. Couldn't retrieve booking in kiosk and so had to queue which was a bit slow and service terse but this was the only glitch. Business Class lounge in Brisbane was OK, new one is being built at present. Flight left on time and breakfast meal was tasty. Nice to see a little bottle of domestic bubbly on the trolley but wasn't tempted. Crew attentive. Arrived on time and as usual Canberra was quiet so you can exit the airport quickly. I had 90 minutes before my meeting and they let me work in the lounge on arrival which was appreciated.

### "blown away by the service"
I would like to express my thanks for the excellent treatment I received when I flew to Sydney from Toowoomba (flight QF2123 at 1700) on 29th August. I am partially disabled and needed wheelchair assistance as I cannot walk very far. From the moment I entered Wellcamp airport till I left Sydney airport I was treated like a VIP. My return trip on the 20th September (QF2016 at 0840) was a carbon copy. I was blown away by the service I received, both on the ground and in the air. I would recommend Qantas and  will certainly choose again for any future flights. Thank you to all your amazing staff. My flight was booked by my daughter so I don't know my e-ticket details.

### "service was friendly"
QantasLink's Dash 8 was flying on this route (Rockhampton to Brisbane) head to head with Virgin's Embraer 170 jet, but the QantasLink propjet offered a pleasant alternative. Check-in was easy. Once on board the seats were comfortable enough for this short flight, the plane was on time and service was friendly. We were given a snack pack that contained quite an array of nibblies, ranging from a salami stick to a small chocolate frog. (It wasn't possible to specify a vegetarian meal on this sector, but the snack pack offered plenty to eat). This was a late afternoon flight, and the drinks service included wine and beer - with even a top-up if you could manage it on this 70-min flight. All in all a fun experience.

### "service was good"
My flight QantasLink flight from Launceston to Melbourne was at 10.40am and I reached the airport at 9am to get checked-in, but there was no one at the check-in counter. I was worried that the flight was cancelled since there was no one attending the counter, but I later found out that it was because QantasLink at Launceston was understaffed and the same lady that helped us with check in also have to handle the boarding process, hence she was busy and was not there for check-in at 9am. We waited for about 20 minutes before she appeared and she was friendly and her service was quick. The plane was an old DHC 8-400, so the interior wasn't too good, but the seats were still comfortable. The flight attendants greeted us with smiles and their service was good.

### "leaves a lot to be desired"
I fly from Perth to Alice Springs regularly due to work - because of lack of choice i have to fly QantasLink. I find the overall service and aircraft really way below expectations considering how much I pay. Its average $850 return and never mind that the seat of the B717 are old and narrow. The catering is worse than budget airline - there is hardly any non-meat options and they do not provide bread rolls as alternative. The service is so basic for the price. When I wrote to comment on this on Qantas Facebook page, I got a very lukewarm reply that I can choose my meals online. Honestly a cold wrap is not really a meal. Customer service from this airline leaves a lot to be desired.

### "catering is awful"
There is no real point in flying Qantas. Ever since Alan Joyce became CEO of this once iconic airline, it has gone bad to worse. You may as well fly budget and purchase cheese and crackers for five dollars. The flight to Cairns is at 8.15pm, takes two and a half hours, arriving in Cairns around 11.15pm. Good flight but catering is awful - took the cold option of chicken and wild rice salad. Chicken cold and stuck together and rice the same. Whoever is in charge of Qantas catering and came up with the idea of boxed meals needs to be sacked. Qantas charges more expensive fares than ever yet lowers its standards. What a shame.

### "good flights overall"
Flew Brisbane to Hervey Bay return. Aircraft departed Brisbane slightly earlier than scheduled departure time. However, on return from Hervey Bay, aircraft departed 40 minutes late. Both planes were grubby inside. While floor was clean, the sticky dust up along the side walls behind the luggage storage bins was off putting. Flight attendants very accommodating. This flight is only 25 minutes so no sooner we reach cruise level of 14000 feet, it's time to descend. I like this flight as the scenery along Great Sandy Straits is quite stunning. Good flights overall. Recommend QantasLink.

### "very smooth return trip"
Very smooth return trip on Qantas Link from Melbourne to Devonport. Online check-in and boarding procedures were quick. Both flights were on time, and had friendly crews. The seats are a little narrow but otherwise comfortable enough for a short flight. My only complaint was the dark dungeon-like terminal Qantas Link uses in Melbourne, which does not have its own toilet.

### "we had no complaints"
Flew QantasLink, Sydney to Port Macquarie on the 31st following an international arrival on Qantas from the UK. This flight arrived early and, due to a very quick transit through security, customs and baggage reclaim, we were at Domestic 5 hours before our booked flight. Initially told that by the Qantas staff in the terminal that, due to our ticket type, we would have to wait for this flight despite space being available on the earlier one. Then spoke to a staff member on the sales desk who was efficient in transferring us without questions and, more impressively, at nil cost. The flight itself was only 50 mins and despite the coffee machine not working we had no complaints. Most impressive ground staff.

### "pleasure flying with QantasLink"
Travelled QantasLink from Brisbane to Townsville via Mackay. Ticket was $45 cheaper than direct flight due to QantasLink sale. Flights were on time and uneventful. Small snacks with tea and coffee or soft drinks. Staff were attentive. Aircraft clean. Leg room okay. I have flown this routing a few times and each time, my bag appears on the carousel in Mackay when it's checked through to Townsville. I always go out and recheck it at Mackay and there is never a problem. But may catch travellers connecting at Mackay by surprise. So always check for your bag at the baggage carousel and recheck your bag if you see it. Otherwise, a pleasure flying with QantasLink.

### QantasLink customer review
The flights to and from Moranbah would have to be the worst value for money and the most changed for full price flights. I pay an average of 600 dollars plus each way for a flight and 7 weeks out of 7 I have had a flight changed or cancelled. Totally unacceptable. Virgin will be my choice from now on and I will encourage more people to fly this route on Virgin as they never cancel or seem to change.

### QantasLink customer review
Being the first time flying with QantasLink, I was eager to see how standards compared with big brother Qantas. Airport Check In and security was all smooth through Brisbane. It was once I stepped on board that I noticed me and my colleague had the worst seats possible on the plane. Row 25 (back row near the toilets) and seats E and F which had no width and felt almost prison like. In addition to this the Boeing 717 has tail mounted engines which made the flight quite noisy - especially when trying to talk or listen to the cabin crew. Would recommend people sitting in rows 20 and forward to avoid this issue. Inflight services by Cabin Crew were excellent. Great breakfast options and Drinks. Cabin Crew were constantly looking to top up water. No IFE made the 3 and bit hour journey drag on - considering we had read that iPads were offered on this aircraft? I think for the money paid for these tickets some IFE needs to be offered. Aircraft arrived slightly late which was confusing as we took off early - but the delay was not an issue. Modern interior on board and as usual and great experience with Qantas on their regional carrier - Qantaslink

### QantasLink customer review
QF1509 from Sydney to Hobart on their B717-200. Flight departed on time and clear skies gave us a great view of Sydney and the scenery of Tasmania. I think there were only two cabin crew but service was fast and efficient. Plane was very clean and comfortable with good legroom. It was actually a better experience than the Qantas A380 flight from DFW.

### QantasLink customer review
On Friday 13th March I had a flight from Coffsharbour to Dubbo. Because I have a foot problem with my left foot I asked for assistance to get on and off the aircraft at both Coffs and Sydney. The help I got at Coffs was excellent and at Sydney the assistance was even better if that's possible. I was transported from my arrival point to my departure point even allowing time for a coffee in between. The staff at both terminals are to be congratulated for their care and assistance given to me. I will travel with Qantas Link anytime I need to fly in Australia.

### QantasLink customer review
Flew Bundaberg to Brisbane 6 March. Aircraft late which meant I just caught Sydney connecting flight. No explanation offered. Return flight 19 March 1.5 hours late. Scheduled for 6.30. Departed 8 pm. No explanation offered. Not spoken to by ground staff. Too many routes for the number of aircraft in the fleet. Happens regularly now. Driving is the only option on many occasions.

### QantasLink customer review
Brisbane-Longreach-Brisbane Brisbane-Biloela-Brisbane Melbourne-Launceston and Hobart-Sydney mostly in Q400s. I enjoy QantasLink often more than their parent company Qantas. Almost always good friendly service and pleasant flights with good quality (free) wine and snacks - business class level! The only exception was Hobart-Sydney in the Boeing 717 which these days feels claustrophobic with the new seats. This latter flight had below par service for QantasLink.

### QantasLink customer review
Bundaberg to Brisbane. 8 August. I was impressed by the friendly service. For a 50 minute flight they offered a filling snack.

### QantasLink customer review
Brisbane - Bundaberg. 6 August. Very friendly service. For a short 50 minute flight it was a nice surprise to get a tasty snack that was more substantial then the 2 hour QANTAS flight from Melbourne to Brisbane. The free drinks was a nice surprise as well.

### QantasLink customer review
Flew Alice - Ayers Rock crew dished out a bottle of water which is fair enough for such a short flight. Seat comfort and pitch were good on the 717.

### QantasLink customer review
Got hit with a 4 hour delay on Ayers Rock to Cairns flight which spoilt an otherwise good flight. Check in team decided that adults couldn't sit in emergency row with under 15 year old in non exit row behind despite being able to reserve on line. Initially suggested we sat 16 rows away which is far less safe very bizarre. Eventually got 4 seats split by the aisle. Beef curry served for dinner by a very efficient and friendly crew.

### QantasLink customer review
HBA-SYD on the new old 717-200. A fantastic step up from the Q400 service offered on the first and last service to Melbourne each day. The 2-3 seating is great. The other bonus is 2 direct services each way per day to Sydney. My flights left on time and arrived on time each way. Staff were friendly and engaging. iPad for entertainment were good to. Cabins were clean and fresh. Positive experience all round.

### QantasLink customer review
Darwin to Alice Springs on a B-717. A smooth flight which operated on time. The service was friendly. The seats were quite tight but OK for a 2-hr flight. The hot part of my vegetarian breakfast was tasteless and unappetising. Ironically my partner's ordinary breakfast which was tasty and hot was vegetarian!

### QantasLink customer review
QF 2117 CFS-SYD June 6 2014. Boarding was easy. The seat was comfortable enough leg room. We waited while the airport prepared the paperwork for departure. Snacks were served and a good range of drinks offered. The view out the window was good. Magazines provided. Staff were fine. Booking ahead it was cheap.

### QantasLink customer review
This past weekend we flew in a turboprop to Launceston. A lovely experience it flies low enough to enjoy the scenery of Port Phillip Bay and then the landing. On the way we had cold or hot drinks offered two cookies in a bag. On the way back which was early Monday morning we had 2 small quiches each apple water little muesli bite cold/hot drinks which is pretty good for such a short flight. The crew were probably not as immaculate as on longer haul flights but made up for that in warm friendliness. The seats probably had more room than we had in our last long haul flight (Cathay Pacific) and were quite comfy. Of course there is no entertainment but it's such a short flight you don't really need it. A good positive experience I'd happily do again.

### QantasLink customer review
I took flight QF1509 from Sydney to Hobart and flight QF1502 from Hobart to Melbourne. Both flights were on the B717-200. The departure and arrival on both flight was on time. Despite only having two cabin crew on board The customer service was great and they were happy to help. I would definitely take Qantaslink if I have the chance.

### QantasLink customer review
Sydney to Albury Dash 8. Wonderful service with breakfast friendly efficient staff smooth trip. Have booked another return trip Sydney to Albury with special requirements and the staff couldn't be more helpful.

### QantasLink customer review
Yesterday I flew Qantaslink from Sydney to Dubbo. I was impressed with a staff member taking me aside as I immediately entered the check in area and checking me in putting in my frequent flyer number and arranging me to have the seat I requested. Check in was completed within 2 minutes as I was not checking luggage. The lounge / waiting area where gates 18 / 19 was not in the best condition many seats threadbare and torn but that area offered a great viewing area to watch aircraft taking off better than the Virgin lounge. The aircraft was a Bombardier Q400 beautiful looking aircraft clean and tidy inside seats were very small however but this was to be expected with a turbo prop aircraft and I was comfortable enough. Crew were friendly and professional the flight was only 50 minutes and it was great to be in the taxi within 5 minutes of the aircraft arriving at Dubbo.

### QantasLink customer review
Flew QantasLink Melbourne to Launceston April 2014. Terminal gates at Melbourne are shared with Jetstar - in other words congestion confusion and poor communication at the terminal are the norm. The flight itself was uneventful. On-time performance was reasonable so was baggage recovery on arrival.

### QantasLink customer review
Flew the Dash 8 -400 service from Melbourne to Adelaide over the weekend. I really like the Dash 8 aircraft and enjoy Qantaslink's service. The aircraft was approximately 30% full on today's flight. The Cabin Manager was very engaging and always smiling whilst her offsider had that bad QF attitude that their famous for. We were served a small refreshment (which came in a small box consisting of feta cheese crackers some chocolate and mints) and a beer. The journey over to Adelaide was generally a good one and will continue to use QF for this Dash 8 service.

### QantasLink customer review
Alice Springs to Cairns in a B717 great crew and a tasty hot meal was served usual good QantasLink service.

### QantasLink customer review
Flew Melbourne to Perth and then to Paraburdoo last week. At Perth all checked in ok the flight left on time but when seated in 25A and partner in B it started to go wrong. No windows and a screaming jet engine beside me. The noise level would have exceeded safe noise levels and only decreased when on decent into PBO. Returned a few days later arriving at airport to check in. I would think we were about 2/3rds the way in the line. Get to check in and given 25 D and E. Locals we talked to said the flights now are nearly all booked for FIFO's. (Fly In Fly Outs). You can't even check in online and they said that it is common not get on the flight even though it is booked and paid for and then be placed on standby. Not an enjoyable experience.

### QantasLink customer review
First time on the early service HBA-MEL since the change from a jet to a Dash-8 Q400. It was about half an hour slower but otherwise was fine. Staff friendly and the food pack edible. Don't agree with what used to be the busiest Qantas flight out of Hobart being downgraded to a turboprop.

### QantasLink customer review
CNS-HID-CNS-TSV. CNS-HID and CNS-TSV on Dash8-400 HID-CNS on Dash8-300. Snacks served on all legs. Crew friendly and efficient serving food on short flights. Seating on 300 was beginning to show its age.

### QantasLink customer review
Had a short break in Broome flying QantasLink on their 717 aircraft. Slightly delayed outbound on time for the return leg. Seats looked new and were reasonably comfortable but these aircraft are configured with 125 seats not 115 as stated in the inflight magazine so pitch is only 30 inches. I ordered vegetarian meals - slightly disappointing dry-bread sandwich outbound but on the return flight they served a small but tasty curry - nice. The cabin crew were friendly and pro-active on both flights - it seems you can count on this with QantasLink whereas on Qantas it's hit and miss.

### QantasLink customer review
Flew Canberra - Sydney return. On time friendly crew tasty snack and drink (had just flown an international flight with another airline and Qantas's snack was better). Our bags were left behind but I cannot complain as we barely made the flight due to customs delays and staff did everything they could to actually get us on the plane. Bags were delivered to our home a few hours later.

### QantasLink customer review
Melbourne-Launceston. How hard is it to seat Husband and Wife (same booking) together? Small plane 2 seats either side of aisle - apparently very hard. Called Qantas to see if they could change seating only to be told I should have chosen seats at time of booking tried to point out that is not an option on this route told seat selection is available on all Qantas operated domestic flights!

### QantasLink customer review
I normally fly from Mildura to Melbourne return once a year. I'm legally blind and I also suffer from a medical condition which effects my mobility and everyone from the ground crew to the flight attendants have provided me with excellent service. The Dash 8 Q400 aircraft are fantastic aircraft's for short flights.

### QantasLink customer review
ROK-BNE return. To Brisbane on an Alliance Fokker 100 and return on a Qantaslink Boeing 717. Both flights left on time meals plentiful for hour flight. Staff attentive. Bags on belt within 10 minutes of landing. Both flights impressive.

### QantasLink customer review
Recently flew DRW-GOV-CNS-DRW and flights were on time and the service was very good. Cain crew were excellent on the DRW-GOV-CNS and pretty good on the return CNS-DRW sector. I always like flying on the B717.

### QantasLink customer review
BNE-Longreach-BNE. Good flights both ways even though affected by headwinds which is beyond airline control. Comfortable seats good seat pitch (I'm 186cm) attentive FAs and appropriate snacks and drinks made for pleasant flights. Having flown Qantas Link over the years in NSW VIC and now QLD I've never been disappointed.

### QantasLink customer review
Pleasant and reliable on time service. Simple and sufficient refreshments. Cabin crew pay much moew attention to the passenger than Air Asia.

### QantasLink customer review
Perth-Ayers Rock-Cairns return. B717. I am a bigger person and found that the seats were more than adequate with plenty of leg room. Aircraft very clean and in good condition. Cabin crew excellent on both trips food was light snacks to Cairns and light snacks and a light meal on return which was adequate. Only negative was the lack of in flight entertainment on a flight of approx. 5 1/2 hours in the air.

### QantasLink customer review
SYD-CNB-BNE-MKY-BNE in a variety of aircraft mostly Q400 and B717. Surely one of Australia's best airlines. Excellent service throughout with always surprisingly good wines (free). Only negative is occasional loud pop music piped through the cabin before departure (I still have not worked out why some airlines do this? if they think it calms passengers nerves they are very mistaken). Flying on the 'new Boeing 717' on QantasLink is superb.

### QantasLink customer review
MKY-BNE-MLB return. Overall positive experience on-time friendly courteous staff. Clean aircraft with plenty of leg-room nice snack-food and bar service on the evening flight back to MKY. Qantas is still my preferred airline.

### QantasLink customer review
Fly BNE-EMD-BNE regularly for work. Cabin is tidy small but comfy and always get fed and watered (choice of red or white or beer after 3pm). Luckily work pays for the flights as a return trip can easily cost $900+! Cabin can be a little noisy due to the propellers but chuck some headphones in and watch a short movie or TV.

### QantasLink customer review
SYD-CBR-SYD Dash 8 on both legs. Early morning flight to Canberra service was good breakfast served follow by tea and coffee. Due to the fog we circled Canberra for 2 hours. Extra water round service. On returning flight one of the crew was not that pleasant. Unusual and disappointing for QantasLink staff.

### QantasLink customer review
BNE-BDG-BNE on Dash 8 and Q400 aircraft. Good service and always surprisingly good quality wine. Outbound flight on time but a major 3 hour+ delay to the return flight. Flight crew did their best but as is becoming increasingly common these days it was fellow passengers who caused the biggest upset. Credit to QantasLink for handling the situation very well.

### QantasLink customer review
Very pleasant flight on fully loaded Dash-8 from BNE to NTL. Flight departed 10 minutes late but arrived on time. Was given emergency exit seat with a bit more legroom to make this journey as comfortable as possible for a guy with my height of 201 cms. Skipped to drink and snack service but seems standard fare. Very friendly crew good information from the flight deck and air craft seemed in good condition even though well used.

### QantasLink customer review
MEL-MQL-MEL. Flights late to depart. Annoyed at being informed only 10 minutes before departing. Inflight service is excellent the food is plentiful along with drinks.

### QantasLink customer review
ROK-BNE-ROK. Flights late to depart. Annoyed at being informed only 10 minutes before departing. Onward connections changed without incident as they were with Qantas. Inflight service excellent the food is plentiful along with drinks. Getting bussed around at Brisbane airport is a tad annoying. I travel Qantaslink a lot and of late their on-time performance has been woeful. Otherwise good service.

### QantasLink customer review
PER-GER-PER. Annoying start as you have to be bussed to Dash-8-400 and they insist on boarding you 40 minutes before so you can stand in the bus until everyone is loaded. Geraldton is a walk to the terminal which is much faster. New Dash-8 plane specifically for this route fairly quiet but full flights. Don't sit near the engines if you can avoid it. Services onboard good and pilot good with information. Would prefer the F- 100 that Skywest are running but QF has better times. On return the dreaded bus back to the terminal. Big disappointment there.

### QantasLink customer review
BNE-Hervey Bay-BNE as part of a return trip from MEL using FF points. Dash-8 400 less than 25% full in both directions. Noisy but otherwise comfortable flight with comfortable seats and good seat pitch for 40-45 minute flights. Tasty snacks and drinks offered on both flights by friendly cabin staff. Our carry-on bags were too large for the overhead lockers and were tagged and placed in the hold in BNE and handed back to us on the tarmac at Hervey Bay. We checked them in on the return flight. Qantaslink-Sunstate has a good product on this service and we'd happily fly again.

### QantasLink customer review
BNE-MKY-BNE QantasLink Flights but Alliance Airlines operated the sectors I was on this week so the flight standard should be viewed in that respect. The FA's on the Brisbane-Mackay run were not good one with a terrible attitude especially towards other crew members which was unfortunately easy to witness. However the return run from Mackay to Brisbane more than made up for the first leg due to exceptionally good cabin service including superb wines! and very good on-time performance in the quick and quiet F-100s.

### QantasLink customer review
Perth to Geraldton. Trapped on the ground at Perth for 50 mins - not Qantas' fault as Perth is so busy nowadays. FA's served water and managed to do some work while waiting. Captain kept all informed on PA. Seems to be plenty of legroom even for me at 187cm. Qantaslink 717 services in WA are by Cobham and of a very high standard. Cabin staff are uniformly excellent. The Geraldton service is by Dash 8-400. Did the return on Skywest - they've taken to using F-100 jets to replace the F-50 turboprop when available. This makes for a very quick trip. Couldn't fault either carrier but glad QF has arrived to give some competition.

### QantasLink customer review
Regular traveller on Qantaslink. Snacks on all services good. I find the leg room great and the seats quite comfortable although there is a small recline. All my flights have been on time. Usually fly out of Dubbo Albury or Brisbane. Crew love to have long chats in the galley while customers sitting with rubbish on tray table waiting to be collected. Standards have dropped over the last couple of years. From chewing gum to no smiles you just expect it now.

### QantasLink customer review
I do 2 or 3 sectors a week on their noisy Dash 8's. When they are late they don't tell you. When boarding - especially CNS - they do not have enough ground crew/gate staff. When flying into HTI you have to race to make your boat connection as they are invariably late. Today I had the misfortune to do GLT-ROK-MKY-TSV-CNS. Both cabin crew yawned all the way. I wanted to apologise for keeping them awake. Their social chatter was their focus. The flight was of course late out of GLT but at every intermediate port there was no effort from flight or ground crews to make up time. If at all possible travel using BNE as a hub instead of the coastal nightmare and use VB for service and efficiency. The days of Qantaslink are surely numbered as VB progressively take them on. Unless of course they get their act together at the last minute.

### QantasLink customer review
TVL-MKY-BNE-BDG-BNE. A mixture of Q400s F100 and Dash8-300s. Excellent service on all flights - spare seat next to me on every sector and good quality wine served on late afternoon flights. Very good leg room on the Fokker 100. Good quality service and professionalism.

### QantasLink customer review
Sydney-Canberra return in Y class. Dash 8400 very small aircraft but comfortable legroom. I am impressed with new Canberra airport and Qantas lounge. Both flights were a little late cabin crews friendly only 30 mins flight and a muffin was served follow by tea/coffee and soft drinks.

### QantasLink customer review
Have flown SYD-ARM return at least 8 time the past 4 months. Dash 8-300's a little old but plugging away with seats still in good condition. Most of the flight is taken up with the cabin crew serving either a refreshment/light meal drinks and sometimes mints. In my opinion better than QANTAS mainline.

### QantasLink customer review
What a lovely way to fly compared to Jetstar. I have business in Northern NSW with a choice of Jetstar to Ballina or Qantas Link to Coffs Harbour. Give me Qantas Link every time - more room - a decent snack - a drink in the afternoon - friendly service and far more chance of being on time! Good value for money into Coffs as there is competition from Virgin.

### QantasLink customer review
SYD-WGA-SYD. Trip down on morning flight was on the larger Q400. The crew weren't present for most of the flight and were very robotic offering bare minimum service. The refreshment whilst nice was not substantial and handed out in a rushed manner. However one positive is that the crew phoned ahead for taxis due to the small size of Wagga's airport and distance from the town centre. Flight back to Sydney was on the smaller Q300. The crew were very friendly constantly making their way through the cabin to talk to passengers. The service on this flight was a stark contrast to the first flight. Both flights were on time and cabins were clean.

### QantasLink customer review
Port Moresby to Cairns return. I think this is the first Qantaslink international sector. Compared to Air Niugini flight is a dream. Good crew functional catering and plenty of wine if required. It is great to finally see some real competition on this route.

### QantasLink customer review
CBR-MEL-CBR. The staff were friendly and helpful and I thought that there was a noticeable improvement compared to what it used to be like. Was served a fruit bar and some sort of savoury scone along with beverage. The flights were on-time boarding and check-in wasn't a hassle.

### QantasLink customer review
CNS-TSV. Missed flight due to late arrival of Jetstar flight from DRW. Advised to go to Qantas service desk at Cairns airport to obtain new flight details. Only took a couple of minutes to be booked on to next available flight. Received snack on 50 minute flight.

### QantasLink customer review
BNE-HVB-BNE. Was a little irritated on the return trip that there was no wine offered despite departing at 35 minutes late at 1545. Legroom is satisfactory for a 45 minute sector. The snacks are on-par with mainline Qantas economy. Luggage was tagged appropriately for my connection to Qantas Business class at BNE. All-in-all QantasLink is doing a reasonable job on their short routes but I can't get past not being offered a glass of wine to apologise for a late departure especially 15 minutes before the bar service officially begins and even more-so since the full economy fare is almost the same as the BNE-SYD full economy fare on Qantas.

### QantasLink customer review
SYD-CFS: return flight on Qantaslink Bombardier Q400. Flight was smooth (despite inclement weather) and quiet. Food was very good and served from boutique style Australian food producers. Although I am not generally a Chardonnay drinker I would happily enjoy the Chardonnay served on the flight at home. Service was with a smile personal and efficient. Overall it was an excellent flight. A nice change from the plastic faced Virgin Blue staff and the magazines with Richard Branson on nearly every page.

### QantasLink customer review
EMD-BNE Dash 8 400 one class cabin good flight with friendly attentive cabin staff who did all they could. Snack and coffee served (no alcohol before 4pm) seats were leather and comfortable for short haul but no recline. I am 6' and found there to be more than adequate leg room. An excellent service that other airlines could learn from.

### QantasLink customer review
BNE-HVB-BNE in Dash 8 300 and Q400 aircraft excellent flights. I would happily fly QantasLink all around Australia if I could. Superb service for short flights which were on-time despite poor weather. Excellent wine (free) on these short flights. Often the best service on Qantas family of airlines is the smaller internal flights with young and enthusiastic staff of QantasLink - they have an entirely better attitude compared with many of their long-serving senior colleagues on the long-haul services of Qantas.

### QantasLink customer review
Alice Springs to Darwin. Whilst no entertainment options I found the flight rather pleasant with a service that was that bit more personal than regular Cityflyer. The food was good and ample. Leg room was sufficient quiet aircraft and friendly staff made what would have been an otherwise average trip more bearable.

### QantasLink customer review
MEL-LST-MEL on Qantaslink Q400s - excellent on-time and comfortable flights with hardworking flight attendants. Return late afternoon flight from Launceston offers free top quality wine plus a snack and coffee - better than some business class flights I have had on other carriers.

### QantasLink customer review
Perth/AyerRock/ Cairns on B717. Great legroom far superior to the others. Great service which on each leg included a drink and snack followed by a meal. Cabin staff very good. Pity I cant fly them on main routes. My only very small gripe is no entertainment options.

### QantasLink customer review
Melbourne-Devonport return on the Q400. Pleasant flights friendly service and a tasty snack each time. The return flight operated 35 minutes late. The main let-downs concerned handling at Melbourne Airport. Qantas needs better signage to the bag drop counter for people who have checked in online. The QantasLink departure lounge is a dark and cavernous place. And the baggage from our flight was offloaded onto a carousel with baggage from two JetStar flights: people were milling 4-deep around the carousel trying to see their bags while the next carousel was not being used at all!

### QantasLink customer review
MEL-Devonport. Some 10 minutes after scheduled departure time a very embarrassed pilot announced that not a single checked bag had been delivered to the plane. After yet more delays we finally left some 45 minutes late. I regretted not choosing REX into Burnie instead of this carrier. On arrival into Devonport the captain stated he still could not find any explanation for this logistics breakdown at Tullamarine. (I assume it was industrial as unloading off my return Jetstar flight into the same terminal was extremely slow.

### QantasLink customer review
MEL-LST on Dash-8. The 300 series not as nice as new Q400 due to vibration and cabin noise but comfortable seat with ample leg room. Warmly welcomed by FA with two crew serving a tasty scone OJ and hot drinks. 1/5th of the cost of other carries for this Christmas eve flight. Priority hand luggage accepted on boarding in Melbourne and handed back on the tarmac in Lauunceston with a cheery Merry Christmas would rate as excellent except for the older aircraft.

### QantasLink customer review
BNE-HVB-BNE superb evening flight on QantasLink in a somewhat small Dash8 200 Series. However this was ideal for a short 40 minute flight gliding over the northern beaches and Fraser Island and being served snacks and repeat serves of an excellent wine (as good as business class wines on many airlines) and all this for an economy airfare. FA attentive and very competent to get so much accomplished and provide good service for such a short flight. Return morning flight serves coffee with the same FA with good service. Flights all on-time with courteous check in service at the adequate regional Hervey Bay Airport.

### QantasLink customer review
Perth to Bundaberg return. Except for the wait at Brisbane (4 hours on return) was happy with the aircraft and the service. Loved being able to put our luggage on at Perth (and Bundaberg on the way home) and not having to check in again at Brisbane.

### QantasLink customer review
BNE-HVB-BNE. Surprisingly good experience. Q400 was nice little aircraft during 50 minutes flight cake tea and coffee was served. Professional and pleasant cabin crews no Qantas club at Hervey Bay airport not even security check it was a little bit scary. In general it was really pleasant and surprising trip.

### QantasLink customer review
I recently travelled on a Qantaslink dash 8 300 Mel-LST service and found the service remarkable. I was greeted in such a friendly manner legroom was excellent considering the size of aircraft and snack service and the complimentary wine was quite unexpected for a regional service and flight time just over an hour. I have also heard that LST dash services are being upgrade to Q400 services can anyone comfirm this?

### QantasLink customer review
Weipa-Cairns. I could hardly believe the comments below about this Qantas Link route. I have been travelling this route regularly in the past year. It is usually late and often by hours. When delays occur there is no information available at Weipa airport and the Qantas call centre cannot tell you what is happening.
