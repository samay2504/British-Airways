### "see no point in using their app"
Customer service is terrible, endless phone queues and slow, inconsistent chat responses. A simple name correction (due to an error caused by their own booking system) led to a fee of €130 and took hours to resolve. This is the kind of issue that should be easy to handle directly in their app, creating a fantastic customer experience, but instead, Norwegian completely fails here. I see no point in using their app except for accessing your boarding pass. I strongly recommend choosing another airline if hassle-free service matters to you.

### “I simply love Norwegian”
I simply love Norwegian. It’s a no nonsense airline that has been incredibly reliable on 15 of the 16 legs that I have recently flown with them Seat pitch is sufficient, pricing is fair and predictable, and everything just works. The service is fine and the onboard menu contains all you need for a few hours in the air. I regard them much higher than most “old” airlines now (saying this as a Lufthansa Senator).

### "very stressful and unpleasant"
We travelled on #Norwegian.com from Edinburgh to Tromso via Oslo on 12th December 2024. The flight from Edinburgh, DY1641 was due to depart at 13:05. It was significantly delayed and as a result, our connecting flight to Tromso (DY328) took off from Oslo before our plane from Edinburgh had arrived. We were put on the next available flight to Tromso, DY382, which was also delayed. We eventually arrived in Tromso around 22:30. On arrival in Tromso, we learned that Norwegian had not put Mums’ wheelchair on the flight. While we were stuck in Oslo for 4 hours I had specifically checked with the Norwegian desk and was ensured that Mums’ chair would definitely on the plane! Mum cannot walk and we were abandoned at Tromso airport without her wheelchair! A report was filed at Tromso airport. I have also contacted Norwegian. They haven’t responded. We were only allowed to use the airport wheelchair to get my mother to a taxi. They would not let us take the airport wheelchair to use until her own chair was returned to us. This meant that my wife and I had to physically carry my mum from the taxi into our accommodation. We did not arrive at our accommodation until just after midnight. My Mum was physically exhausted and very poorly. and we were unable to leave our accommodation until the following afternoon when Mums’ wheelchair was finally delivered to us. We only had 4 nights/3 days in Tromso and Norwegian effectively robbed us of our first evening and most of the next day. Unfortunately, our troubles with Norwegian did not end there. Our return flight on the 16th was scheduled to depart Tromso at 08:15, but was also delayed. The plane did not take off until 12:22. Because of this delay, our flight from Oslo to Edinburgh also left without us and we were forced to spend the night in Oslo. Norwegian did provide a hotel and meals, but my wife and I were both due back at work on Tuesday 17th and had to make numerous phone calls to rearrange meetings. We were both also forced to take an additional day of holiday, which is deducted from our allowance for next year. We also had to pay an additional penalty amount to cover our extended parking at Edinburgh airport. Delays happen, but long delays on every flight leading to missed connections is very bad service and to misplace a terminally ill passengers’ wheelchair, effectively imprisoning them in their room for a significant part of their holiday is inexcusable. This was supposed to have been a relaxing dream-come-true holiday for my Mum, but Norwegians’ negligence made it very stressful and unpleasant.

### "provided no guarantee of a refund"
I booked a flight with Norwegian to travel on the 22nd of December, but it was canceled last minute, completely ruining my travel plans. Instead of rerouting me on the next available flight as required by EU Regulation 261/2004, they only offered a flight on the 24th with Norwegian,  too late to spend Christmas as planned. To make matters worse, they refused to book me on another airline, despite it being their legal obligation. I was forced to pay €380 for a new one-way ticket, a significant and unreasonable expense, especially at such short notice. Adding to the stress, they provided no guarantee of a refund. Avoid them if you value your time, money, and peace of mind!

### "I didn't want cash points"
Norwegian issued customers "cash points" for their flights cancelled in 2020 due to COVID 19. This was non-negotiable and I was unable to receive a proper refund. On top of this, these "cash points" had an expiration date. And then it was announced Norwegian was no longer flying cross Atlantic (I live in the US and my cash points were equivalent to a $600 trip from NYC to Paris). It's difficult to get to Europe, let alone then have to book $600 worth of small flights between cities. I would have had to spend another $1,000 just to get over the Atlantic (since flights have gone up in price since 2020). I asked for a refund multiple times and their customer service either ignored me or told me to use my cash points. I didn't want cash points, I never agreed to these. I would never book through them or recommend them to anyone. Worst customer service I've ever dealt with!

### "Nothing really wrong"
Nothing really wrong with the flight at all. It left on time and the crew seemed to be friendly enough. I was seated in 1E. I felt like the seat was quite snug, I would have preferred a non rigid seat.

### “price does not allow for much complaints”
Oslo-Copenhagen 19th Aug. 2024 on a B738. Oslo Airport is shamelessly very pricey. Timely, arrived 20 minutes prior to schedule, smooth flight. Easy, superfast check-in in Oslo. Granted nice, soft, roomy seats and a full row of 3; loads of space. Flight only half full. Catering onboard good, though only at hefty costs. Ticket inexpensive. No IFE, WiFi, or frills. But, no complaints, the price does not allow for much complaints. Boarding/deboarding very quick through jet-bridges. Aircraft and FAs were somehow aged, but all worked effectively.

### "spacious, well bolstered seats"
Porto-Oslo 16th Aug. 2024 on a B737. Ticket purchased on DYs homepage. Check-In online not possible on computer, but need mobile app. No extra costs having BPs printed out in the airport. Large hand-luggage were accepted; regulations appear strict, but are not enforced in any aggressive way. Airport crowded and incredibly hot in sunny afternoons. Boarding in groups is a nuisance as the groups get amalgamated into a large, cramped pool before final boarding. Those passengers called last upon for boarding de facto became the first to board. Onboard, spacious, well bolstered seats, better than for most other airlines, yes! Direct flight, almost took 4 hours. I got a prepaid hot meal served, which was nice and tasty. Full flight. A significant boarding delay of 1 hour created congestion at gate and caused late arrival of more than one hour. No IFE, but WiFi worked.

### "I had plenty of leg room"
I was given seat 1E right at the very front off the plane, which mean boarding and de boarding was extremely smooth. It was a short hop of 1 hour 20 minutes, nothing to complain about. The seat itself was a bit tight, but I had plenty of leg room.

### "changed our seats all the way to the back"
We checked in we had our seats when we were about to board they just changed our seats all the way to the back of the plane. While we had group A tickets. We didn’t get explanation or apology. They were not even looking at us when we were asking them the reason. Horrible service! Also customer service is very unfriendly and not helpful. I would really advise to skip this airline if you can!

### "close to perfection on all aspects"
Copenhagen-Porto 13th Aug. 2024 on a B737 Max 8. 3 hours flight. 1 way ticket for 70 euro was a steal: I got a flight close to perfection on all aspects; Norwegian appears to be growing out of the LCC class and is merely a legacy carrier, except for catering charges. Ticket purchase and online check-in worked well. Cannot check in on homepage but is deferred to their mobile app. In CPH airport, I inquired them at check-in desk to possibly reassign my seat to an exit row; they eventually gave me the entire exit row, in which I could dance, study, and sleep. I was not entitled to this at all; the seat could have costed me the same as the ticket. Spacious, clean aircraft, nice FAs, and good catering offered frequently. Multilingual staff, representing all Nordic countries. Generous carry-on luggage’s accepted without comments. No IFE onboard. Electricity outlets not working. Full flight. On time.

### "crew was friendly and professional"
Boarding was delayed by around 30 minutes but then we waited on the tarmac for around 15 minutes. The crew was friendly and professional but it was very hot inside the cabin. The cabin was uncomfortably hot during much of the flight with random and very short boosts of very cold air that was circulating thrice or four times during the journey. The pre ordered vegetarian meal was ok but it was kept in the heater for too long. The meal didn't come with a drink which is strange especially seeing no free water is distributed. The duty free announcement of four perfumes/after shaves on sale were difficult to decipher. The crew announced WiFi was not available on this flight.

### "never choose Norwegian again"
If I have options in the future, I would never choose Norwegian again, and never go through OSL airport. Transfer in Oslo was a huge hassle: because we had a cat, we had to leave the transit area and go through the customs again. This would require us to go through security too. This left us with next to no time for the actual transfer. Initially we were told at customs that we had to transfer all of our checked baggage by ourselves (even though we had a connection managed by Norwegian). We had to scramble looking for our baggage, nowhere to be found. After telling the customs that our baggage is not on the belt, we were told that "maybe it's transferred for you, we don't know". Security in OSL opened almost all of the inner bags, tore and broken some of the items (rigid gaming console case, for instance) and rearranged all of the items to the point of unusability - we had to repack the bags completely after that.

### "a very affordable fare"
My disclaimer is that in my opinion, Norwegian continues to be the best low-cost carrier in Europe. Again, very pleasant experience; on time, smooth boarding, nice plane, friendly staff and all for a very affordable fare despite late booking.

### "self-checkin counter did not work"
Not Verified |   Forgot to perform an online check-in >180min before flight. Wanted to perform a check-in (65-70min before flight) at the airport without luggage check-in. However, the self-checkin counter did not work and there was no staff at the counter available to help. Therefore, missed my flight. Not sure what went wrong here, why was I not able to perform a check-in? Performed a claim, and all the customer service has answered was that 96 other passenger managed to check-in on that flight.

### “no help from the staff”
Not Verified | It was very problematic from the get-go, and no help from the staff. I would have let go of the initial problems with booking and just rolled my eyes, but they damaged our bag beyond use and we will probably not get expenses back. I have submitted the report (which, by the way, it is so difficult to use their website on a phone). There is no other way to do it as the staff at the airport is not willing to help. We get an e-mail confirmation, so we're waiting as the weeks pass. 3 weeks in I decided to check in on any updates as we haven't heard back and I am told after you submit a report you also need to submit a claim. You are just meant to know this apparently because neither the staff at the desk said anything nor did my confirmation in the e-mail. When I tried to call for help the staff just said sorry can't help you and hung up.

### “Everything went super well”
As expected, I was very satisfied with the short Norwegian flight. Everything went super well, from ticket purchase at a reasonable fare and online check-in to on-time arrival, attentive staff, and leg space. Norwegian continues to be my favorite European low-budget airline for a reason.

### "We are very satisfied"
Everything went smoothly. From web checkin, we were a party of three, and we got seats beside each other. No trouble to keep the stroller until boarding. The flight was nice, but they should have charging possibilities. We landed on time, and we got the baggage pretty fast. We are very satisfied

### "I'd definitely use them again"
Nice modern plane and very friendly crew. Comfortable enough for a low cost carrier one of the best I'd say. All seemed organised. I'd definitely use them again. Unlike several other airlines I've used this year, no schedule changes either. I'm impressed.

### "I will never again choose Norwegian"
Not Verified |  Worst experience I have ever had, not only with an airline, but any company. We were traveling from the UK to visit my family in Sweden and for the first time ever we decided to bring our miniature dachshund Dobby with us. Flying from London to Stockholm we flew with SAS and had a wonderful experience, everything went so well. When in Sweden we called up Norwegians customer service to book Dobby on the flight. They advised us that this could not be done over the phone but had to be done at the check in desk at the airport. However, when we arrived at the airport were were told by the staff at the check in desk that this had to be done over the phone. After spending nearly 2 hours by the desk, pleading and crying (my partner had a full on panic attack right next to it) and trying to sort out a seat for our dog - and yes they had room for him - we finally missed our flight due to the incompetence of the airport staff. Were were advised that they now could book Dobby on a different flight (so they evidently could do it at the check in desk) but we had to pay. It is impossible for me to describe the domino effect that was installed upon us that morning at Arlanda Airport in Stockholm. We missed all of our connecting journeys, after having to spend the day and night at the airport it eventually took us 56 hours to travel back home to the UK and we were suddenly £3000 out of pocket. Money that we have been saving for years. The amount of stress that was put on us and our puppy was indescribable. When we came home we obviously filed a claim against Norwegian, even though we had lost £3000 we only filed for £1000. You will not believe the response we got- they claimed that because we did not check in 2 hours prior to departure it was our own fault that we missed the flight. When we explained that we were by the check in desk for over an hour trying to sort out Dobby's seat Norwegian replied and said: we are denying this claim and we won't speak or reply to you anymore. Since then we have had no response from Norwegian. I usually fly with Norwegian 4/5 times a year, after this I will never again choose Norwegian.

### "I would use Norwegian air in the future"
Not Verified |  Plane was on the older side, seats a bit uncomfortable but not a major problem for a 1 hour flight. Slight delay taking off but once in the air a smooth flight, no complaints. I would use Norwegian air in the future.

### "they haven't responded"
Caught up in the UK ATC outage at the end of August 2023. Terrible communication from the airline, but appreciate it was an unprecedented event. Claimed for a hotel, as is the right in an event like this, and a month on they are still to acknowledge the claim opened, never mind refund it. I have chased by email multiple times and they haven't responded, I have also called and they said it is still being investigated, they are purposefully trying to drag out paying for something that is a legal obligation for them to cover. First and definitely the last time I will ever fly with Norwegian.

### "lady at gate was completely inflexible"
Worst airline when it comes to allow hand luggage. The flight is empty but the lady at gate was completely inflexible on taking one piece of cabin luggage on board. I will never fly with a company that does not care a bit about customer comfort and satisfaction even when suggesting to pay for the cabin luggage.

### "Stay away if you can"
I booked a flight on April 2020 from Chicago, USA-London, Gatwick, UK by Norwegian Airlines. However, due to covid my flight was cancelled and I received 10387 cash points from Norwegian Airlines as a refund for my expenses. I am planning to book a similar flight from LAX to London this year, but I noticed that Norwegian stopped operating from USA in 2021. I have contacted Norwegian Airlines customer service to help me use the cash points in another of their partner airlines or refund me the money in the original payment method, but they are refusing to do either. Instead, they are giving me a deadline to use their cash points, which is completely unethical. I booked my ticket from USA with the intention to travel from USA. Since Norwegian Airlines stopped operating from USA, how can I use the cashpoints with Norwegian Airlines? I am a US permanent resident and I am not seeing any way how I can spend the cash points in Europe. If I cannot spend my cash points with Norwegian, I think it is the responsibility of Norwegian to either completely refund my payment or let me use the cash points with your partner airlines for the same booking. At first they cancel the flight and they are trying to trap me by putting a deadline on my cash points. Stay away if you can.

### "delayed an hour and a half"
Not Verified |  Not Verified |  On the outward journey we were delayed an hour and a half because, as they described it “a passenger could not get off the plane”. This turned out to be a very disabled person that they had not organised the proper help for. But they tried to blame it all on him. The poor guy was stuck on there for 90 minutes. On the way back we’re also delayed. This time no explanation why. No announcements. Just a clock ticking on and on. If you’d like a plane that leaves on time try someone else.

### "Chaotic airline"
Chaotic airline. Don’t bother reserving and paying per seat, will be changed 2hrs from departure to accommodate someone else. Rudest reply ever by staff personnel.

### "Norwegian Airline is a disgrace"
An Abysmal Experience: Norwegian Airline's Complete Failure, A Stain on Norway's Reputation. I pen this review as a disappointed customer and a warning siren to those considering Norwegian Airlines for their travel needs. My recent encounter with the airline was an absolute travesty that discredits the company and taints the name of a beautiful country like Norway. Let me start with the calamity in Copenhagen. We had reserved and paid for specific seats in row 2, considering the unique needs of my wheelchair-bound daughter and her helper. In a display of blatant greed and negligence, Norwegian had also sold these seats to someone else. This threw us into a maelstrom of confusion and inconvenience, forcing my daughter into an unsuitable seating arrangement far from her helper. While the ground staff eventually rectified this, it was only after an inordinate waste of our time and emotional energy. If you think that was a one-time failure, think again. On our return, we encountered a check-in agent who embodied incompetence, ignorance, and bigotry. The agent not only refused to honor our paid seat reservations and our paid seat reservations but accused us of being illiterate. Her behaviour was appalling, and she directed us to another counter in a transparent scheme to extract more money from us. A family member who had already paid for her luggage was treated even more poorly. She was told to pay again, showcasing an audacious level of corruption. Fellow passengers and even a colleague of this lamentable agent flagged her behaviour as inappropriate. Yet she persisted in her harassment, completely unaccountable for her actions. The absence of name badges among the ground staff raises a critical question: Is anonymity a tactic to escape the responsibility for such terrible service? Despite this circus of unprofessionalism on the ground, the in-flight crew performed admirably, serving as a stark contrast and the only saving grace. Their decency and competence only made the failures of their ground counterparts more glaring and unacceptable. So, let me be unequivocally clear: Norwegian Airline is a disgrace. Their predatory capitalism, lack of employee accountability, and complete disregard for customer dignity are shocking. If you have special needs or simply expect a baseline level of human decency, steer clear of this airline. The experience with Norwegian Airline has not only shattered our trust in the company but also cast a shadow over Norway’s global reputation for high social welfare and inclusivity standards. It's a slap in the face to the principles that Norway stands for, and for that, Norwegian Airline should be profoundly ashamed.

### "customer service was deplorable"
Not Verified |  While the flight itself was that of a budget airline and had expected annoyances (no complimentary water/drinks, plus candy bar wrappers on the floor when I arrived to my seat), my main complaint was that the company lost my luggage and their customer service throughout the process of trying to locate it was deplorable. My husband and I spent the first 3 days of our honeymoon calling Norwegian Air Baggage department, Norwegian Air general customer service, plus representatives both in Denmark and Italy where not once did a customer rep offer an apology, let alone claim they would do their best effort to try to locate our bag. We were constantly met with the answer, “I don’t know at this time where it is; it is not my job to locate it; the airline has 5 days to search for it but I can’t tell you more than that.” The lack of empathy was more than discouraging, it was a little alarming. We arrived off our flight to Rome on Friday and it wasn’t until Tuesday that only through an electronic search we discovered the bag had been in Rome all along, most likely because it had been unloaded improperly. Not once did the airline try and contact us via text or call to update us that 1) they were doing their best to locate it or 2) that it had been found. By then, we had left Rome. When we got to our next destination (Bologna) the electronic search for our claim notified us the bag would be arriving on a flight to Bologna. We called Norwegian and a rep assured us that we would get a text from a courier as the bag was on its way from Bologna airport to our hotel. Upon the day of our departure from Bologna to our next destination, the bag still hadn’t arrived. We called again where a representative said her colleague had been “incorrect” because there is no Norwegian Air representative at the Bologna airport to ensure the bag would be connected to a courier. Desperate that our bag wouldn’t be lost at the Bologna airport, we rearranged our travel plans and went to the Bologna airport only to discover the bag had never even arrived. It was most likely still in Rome. We updated the electronic claim to ask that they just send our bag home to our permanent address in the US. We ultimately traveled without this luggage for our entire honeymoon. I think it is strongly inadvisable to book through Norwegian Air. Their customer service throughout this whole fiasco was worse than anything I’ve ever experienced.

### "800 DKK for two bags of luggage and carry on"
Website suggests booking baggage 4 hours prior to boarding. I attempted to do this on numerous occasions and told to contact my travel agent. When I did this, was told had to do it through airline, back and forth it went. Arrived at the airport and explained situation - charged 800 DKK for two bags of luggage and carry on (had to check in as was not able to register prior). Absolutely no flexibility unfortunately.

### "exceptional flight attendants"
Not Verified | I would like to commend the airline for having exceptional flight attendants. In this instance we met an attendant who spent about 5-10 min towards the end of the flight. I was stricken by his friendliness and the amount of time he spent talking and entertaining my 3 year-old, 11 year-old, and wife. He was so friendly and showed so much interests in the kids it seemed unreal this level of service was possible on any airline. His attitude and availability made hundreds of other attendants I’ve had in my life pale. He was just on another level of customer service with his smile and savoir-faire

### "Friendly service"
Left on time and arrived early which was a pleasant surprise. Friendly service. The seats seemed a little on the hard side but that could just have been me.

### "they refused to provide a refund"
The complaint concerns the booking system with Norwegian Airlines. The issue is the option for baggage in the hold. It must be noted we are fully familiar with modern on-line booking systems and e-tickets. At no point did we order 2 suitcases for the hold. We contacted customer service and they refused to provide a refund and informed us those were the rules. This equated to an additional €50 on top of our flight cost with no possible recourse. I wonder if hackers have manipulated their booking system to help jack-up company revenues. On this basis I would recommend people to be very careful when booking with Norwegian and take note that sometimes "Possession is 9 tenths of the Law".

### "Easy and comfortable"
Not Verified |  Had a lovely experience flying with Norwegian. I checked in through their app and obtained all boarding passes for me and my family. Check-in at the airport was extremely smooth and efficient - boarding the same. Extremely fast and efficient. I was travelling with my 3 year old son and the check-in agent went out of her way to ask if we would like to board first with our stroller. Super friendly gate staff and cabin crew. We were greeted with smiles everywhere and super welcoming attitude. I will absolutely fly again with Norwegian. Easy and comfortable.

### "website is difficult to use"
One of the worst airlines I have used. The website is difficult to use and I had issue to obtain my boarding pass. I went to the airport and even the staff didn't know what was going on and how to sort it. They had to call a superior staff to sort my boarding pass problem. I tried by phone and chat. It seems when people comment about the problem they had with them they block. I wouldn't recommend it at all

### "often delayed at least 1h"
Not Verified | Evening flights between KRK and CPH are often delayed at least 1h just because the plane did not make it on time from the previous route. Poor logistics of the company move the landing time of the delayed flights to e.g. 2 AM, which causes sleep deprivation of the traveller and greatly increases the cost of the trip as often the only option to get home at this hour is to take a taxi.

### "being significantly delayed"
Our flight being significantly delayed due to "weather reasons" while other airlines come and go to and from the same airports with no delays. I would seek out any other airline over them.

### "Was disappointed with everything"
Not Verified |  Ble skuffet med alt fra nettside og ansatte på flyplass osv. ville kjøpe cabinbagasje og prøvde å gjøre det både på nettet og via appen uten hell. Måtte betale mye ekstra på flyplssen for en liten bagasje som ikke veide mere enn 7 kg - Was disappointed with everything from website and airport staff etc. wanted to buy cabin luggage and tried to do it both online and via the app with no luck. Had to pay a lot extra at the airport for a small piece of luggage that weighed no more than 7 kg.

### "fare didn't include any luggage"
Apparently Norwegian airlines requires passengers to know their luggage options at the time of the ticket purchase. I purchased a light fare and as I learned later it didn't include any luggage. I contacted Norwegian 24 hours before the flight and requested to change my ticket to include one carry on. They told me it was not possible to do the change over the phone but I could do it at the check in counter of the airport. When I came to the counter, the employees refused to change the ticket to include the carry on even though I explained that I won't be able to make it to a connecting international flight if I have to exit and pick up my checked bag. I tried booking a new ticket with the luggage on my phone but it showed as available but they said I could only do at the ticket office. The ticket office refused to do it. I was tossed back and forth between the check in counter and ticket office and every employee only pointed to my mistake at booking and refused to help. As a result I missed a connecting flight. If the customer service explained to me that this procedure would not be possible, I would just buy a new ticket with carry on luggage for $150 instead of spending $650 for a new international flight

### "Customer service does not respond"
Customer service does not respond. The aircraft are untidy and the seats are partly worn. If you're expecting a monetary refund, there's no point in waiting. I do not recommend!

### "Underwhelming experience"
Extremely hard, uncomfortable seats, prepaid meal didn't include water, paid priority boarding that never took place, so slow WiFi that was practically unusable, crew OK, but not really friendly. Return flight departure was delayed 50 minutes, but no info about the gate until half an hour before boarding. Underwhelming experience. I would be willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, but the seats were so uncomfortable, that I believe this is the last time on board one of their planes, given the fact, that their tickets are not low cost at all.

### "service was far above what anyone could express"
We booked a transit flight to Rhodes, we had a small window to change flights in Sweden. There was a problem with the aeroplane and we were off loaded in Alicante because of an electrical fault. However after a short while the fault was fixed, and asked to return to the plane. This now made it that we would miss our connection, but the aircraft staff came and asked us when our connection flight was due to leave. They then returned and informed us that our flight was on the next gate to where we where going to dock. They moved my husband and myself just prior to landing to 2 free seats at the front so that we would be able to leave the plane first. When the cabin door opened they called our names and told us how to get to the gate, we ran as fast as we could to the gate, and they where waiting for us, because they had been informed that we where on our way. Also we had booked in luggage and this was also transferred onto our flight to Rhodes. I cannot praise the service we received enough, as I consider the service we received was far above what anyone could express. Most excellent.

### "A perfect flight"
A perfect flight; check-in was smooth, no waiting at the airport, boarding on time and arrival ahead of schedule. Food onboard was not brilliant but acceptable. Crew friendly and efficient. Wifi acceptable and seat comfort ok. A very good budget airline.

### "We are pleased with Norwegian"
The flight took off on schedule and landed ahead. The cabin is clean, delicate and seats are pretty good. For a budget airline, it is really much better than competitors we have tried. Service is acceptable but not brilliant. Crew is smiling and efficient. I like the pricing model Norwegian uses; you by the basic fare and add optionals as required. Much like buying a car. We are pleased with Norwegian and will continue using their services. The only reason I don't give full score is the somewhat chaotic check in but I suspect that is an airport issue beyond the control of Norwegian.

### "No priority boarding"
I'm travelling with 2 instruments and bought 2 carry on bags and priority boarding. The 2 instruments together take less space then 2 carry on suitcases and fit within the size allowance. They decided to take away our instruments to check in with other non fragile things like trolleys. No priority boarding and very bad service. Avoiding Norwegian air from now on. Walking on board I see plenty of space.

### "10/10 for a brilliant service"
My son flew today as an unaccompanied minor with Norwegian from Copenhagen to Dublin. It was his first time to do it and it went amazingly well. From our first encounter with Pernille at the check in desk I knew he was in safe hands. She was very kind, efficient and a great representative for the airline. 10/10 for a brilliant service. Thank you.

### "a true fairytale on customer service"
This is a true fairytale on customer service during difficult times for carriers and passengers. . We booked this flight many months ago for a concert in London and were extremely concerned when all the chaos started this summer. Our flight was hit by the air technicians´ strike in Norway and our flight was cancelled. Norwegian then told us they were trying to get us another flight but we were not hopeful. Much to our surprise, 1 hour after cancellation, they came up with an alternative via Trondheim where we had to spend the night. Not only did they properly rebook our flight but also arranged a first class hotel for us that was ready on arrival. This was customer service as it should be and they deserve praise. The flight(s) were just like you expected from Norwegian; you get what you pay for; planes that are clean and comfortable with smiling and positive crew. I like their concept; you pay for what you need, no more, no less. If you want additional services, like extra luggage, food, fast track or whatever, you pay extra. Fair enough.

### "lost our bags 2 weeks ago"
Norwegian Airlines lost our bags 2 weeks ago. They found them 2 days later but bungled/totally neglected any attempt to deliver them. They do not call you or answer emails. Phone queues are typically over an hour at best even after you find out the right number to ring. Other numbers do not respond at all. The online system that is supposed to tell you the status of your lost baggage is a joke

### "they have improved everything"
First flight with Norwegian after their suspended their flights due to financial problems. Have to say that they have improved everything. Service was good. FAs were very polite and friendly. Also very good and clear announcements from the cockpit. According to their prices Norwegian is not anymore a low cost carrier, but everything is much better than before. Recommend.

### "Overall the experience was good"
This is a follow up on my review from yesterday. After the technical delay some people insisted on getting off the plane causing a further delay,2 hours total. The flight itself was smooth, service and food was good. Overall the experience was good under difficult circumstances. Big picture the technical difficulties were spotted and solved on the ground and relatively quickly

### "most uncomfortable I’ve been on a plane"
Sitting in sweltering heat with mechanics working in the cockpit. The most uncomfortable I’ve been on a plane. The booking process sucked via gotogate, price jumped after I clicked on it, no email confirmation. I was jetlagged and entered the wrong email the one time they didn’t ask to confirm. Sorted out by a 30 minute phone call with a helpful agent. Boarding etc was painless although very hot on the plane. Headed to the runway but then told by the pilot there were technical problems. Lets see where this leads. Everyone on the plane is sweating.15 minutes and counting. Let’s see what happens next

### "Agency tells us to call Norwegian and Norwegian tells us to call the agency"
This company is a joke. They cancelled our flight which was in the morning at midnight and offered a flight for the day after (which ruined all plans and left us sleepless thinking what to do). It was a weekend plan and the changed flight didn't work for all of us, we already paid the non-refundable hotel and return ticket. They have staff to cancel flights and send notifications at night while they don't keep anyone to provide customer support during the night. I can't think of an airline company which doesn't provide customer service at night, as there may be urgent problems. They also don't provide support on cancellations if the flights are booked through an agency. They tell you the agency should contact them, not the passengers (the agency tells us to reach out to Norwegian Airlines since we are checked in). I really don't understand the difference between the passenger or the agency reaching out to them. We have booking reference from Norwegian (basically the ticket itself) and all the information related to our flight. Cancelling the flight at last minute and ruining our long weekend plan were their fault but we had to file everything and call different places. Yet our problem is not resolved. Agency tells us to call Norwegian and Norwegian tells us to call the agency.

### "they don't offer to return the money"
My parents trip was cancelled due to COVID. Instead of getting the money back we got cashpoints. A few months after, Norwegian airlines closed the route to Argentina, therefore leaving me without the possibility to use the points for its original purpose. On top of that, Norwegian don't offer any route that doesn't go through Norway. So basically, I had a trip from Argentina to London worth £1000, and now I need to use those points (which will expire at the end of this year) to travel to Norway. Not only they don't offer to return the money, but also they don't even agree on postponing the validity of their own cashpoints (which literally doesn't mean any economic set back to the company).

### "impossible to contact"
Stockholm to Amsterdam. I booked a flight with Norwegian Airlines, and then rescheduled the flight for an additional fee/balance of ticket prices. That flight was then cancelled, so I requested a refund (because rescheduling was "broken" on their app). They only refunded me the fee I paid to reschedule the flight. It is impossible to contact them. I tried going through the claim form only to be told to call the number. I have called the number numerous times, only to be put on hold indefinitely. I have tried emailing only for it to bounce back. I have tried to email them FEEDBACK, and even their website is broken. I have been scammed of 110 euros. DO NOT book Norweigan airlines. They will just send you in circles.

### "its impossible to reach them directly"
My flight was cancelled by this airline due to COVID. Their system automatically selected that I use cash points instead of a refund. Later to find out this airline cancelled all international flights to and from the US. I live in the US which make these points useless if I ever go to Europe. I tried to call them by phone; however, since they cancelled all their hubs within the US they closed down shop and its impossible to reach them directly. You can reach them by submitting a ticket but that is ineffective and they use their policy as a means of not paying you back for something out of your control. This company is terrible. All I wanted was either to get my money back or provide some sort of credit to a company within the US I could use but they do not look out for their customers.

### "not going to use Norwegian again"
In Iceland, Norwegian told me that I had not to see after my luggage in Oslo, but that it would be transported to the final destination. In Oslo,  I learned that this information is wrong. So I had to fetch my luggage, and check it in again. I was among the first to get my luggage, still I was not able to make it in time to the check-in counter, but was 1 minute late and denied boarding. I had to wait until the evening to get another plane. This was a business trip, so it was tightly planned, and Norwegian scheduled the flights, but they miscalculated their own flights. I am not going to use Norwegian again if I can avoid it.

### "They refused to refund me"
Norwegian Air sold me a ticket i May 2022 for a flight from the US to London, then cancelled it. They said they would give me points for a later flight, then months later they cancelled all flights from the US to Europe, making my points virtually useless unless I travelled to Europe to use them there. Contacting their customer support is very difficult in the US now, since they no longer operate here and the customer service line is international, which caused me to incur even more costs. They refused to refund me, extend my points, help me find a cheap way to Europe to use the points.

### "very good for low cost airline"
Both flights were with same B737-800, going to RVN was on time, on the return flight we had 40 minutes delay due to airport closure. Boarding was done with zone system; stuff were easy going not creating problems with passengers carrying larger carry-ons. In flight service on menu buy items. Overall very good for low cost airline. Ticket cost considerably lower than Finnair’s

### "their customer service is awful"
Not Verified |  As I started to read through these reviews I felt more and more angry as the same issues were happening with me. Had flights scheduled in October 2020 which got cancelled due to the pandemic. We were automatically given Cashpoints which we did not want. Now they no longer fly to/from the United States so I asked for a refund so I can actually use the tickets I purchased. I have now gotten their boiler plate email response twice, like others have attached photos of. This is ridiculous and their customer service is awful. Like others have said, they have stolen our money and have no plans for us to fly with them.

### "Can’t fault anything"
Flew Copenhagen – Stockholm 31/8-2021 on a Boeing 373. First time in life, that used Norwegian. Eventless flight, almost boring. However, this is an indirect indicator that everything functioned well. No stress in any process. Easy to book, pay and fly. Check-in easy and several options are given. Took less than a Minute at airport check-in counter to get my Boarding Pass. Generous hand-luggage allowance. No rigid luggage weighing and checks. Smooth boarding and dis-embarking via jet-bridge in both airports. Aircraft clean and staff alert, operational, and kind. Only half load. Departure early, and aircraft arrived 15 minutes ahead of scheduled time. Catering onboard was effective, though consumption is pricey. Announcements clear and timely. WiFi onboard working - apart from a single glitch. The ticket was inexpensive, less than 60 USD. Can’t fault anything, as good as it gets for LCCs, actually it felt like travelling with a fully recognised legacy carrier.

### "9 months of being lied to over a promised cash refund"
Not Verified |  Flight was cancelled due to Coronavirus. After 9 months of being lied to over a promised cash refund, which they had stated would be paid to me, they filed all these transatlantic flights under a liquidation and offered 1% cash refunds on them. Utter frauds and liars on the numerous times I was in contact with them too. They led over 30,000 passengers on the same path, in the full knowledge they would not refund them and file for liquidation.

### "they gave me cash points"
I had a flight cancelled during the pandemic and requested a refund and they gave me cash points instead. Now I have been informed they are no longer doing long haul flight. which now makes my cash points useless due to living in the US. Now they refuse to give refunds saying that I agreed when I was given the cash points I gave up the right to a refund. The fact is they turned my requested refund to cash points without my approval. Now I know why, they never intended for any of the US flights to be refunded based on what I am reading on other reviews.

### "I highly recommend"
Oslo to Trondheim. Amazing airline that I highly recommend. Low cost so follow their rules and everything will be fine. The best low cost airline with amazing staff.

### "Do not book Norwegian Air"
Not Verified |  This airline does not care about its customers. My family and I were supposed to take the flight from LAX to Barcelona in May of the Covid19 crisis of 2020. Even though our flight was cancelled by the airline we were not given a refund for our almost $2,000 worth of tickets. We were only provided "cash points" even though a refund was requested to be used on a future flight. Let me tell you, there are absolutely no flights scheduled from LAX to Barcelona for the foreseeable future. Do not book Norwegian Air!

### "Cash Points were not being given"
My flight with Norwegian was booked for 22 May, but I had to cancel it due to Covid-19. Originally they told me I would be given 'Cash Points' for use against a future flight. After months of pursuing them for my Cash Points (their on-line claim system did not work) I finally received an email saying that Cash Points were not being given on internal flights, so no refund would be made apart from taxes. I had other internal flights in Norway booked with SAS. I also had to cancel these. Full credit voucher given within 24 hours for use in next two year. Norwegian - take some lessons in customer care.

### "called to look into a refund or credit"
My husband and I booked a trip to Paris for March 2020 that got canceled due to COVID-19. The original booking was made the year before months in advance on a credit card. By the time the trip arrived, we had paid off this card and canceled it on good terms. Once we received the email from Norwegian that our flight was canceled, we called to look into a refund or credit. Not only did it take two weeks to get someone on the phone, but by the time we did, a credit was not an option for them. We explained we used a credit card we no longer had; the customer service agent said, "We can't even confirm that was your card in the first place. She later said, " the best we can do is push out the trip as late as August. Okay, and my response was, and if COVID-19 is still blocking travel, then what? Sure enough, travel ban still in place, and I took her advice and tried re-booking it in this weird musical chairs nonsense and could not get through. Now the time has passed, and my husband and I are out almost two thousand dollars. Would it have killed them to extend a flight voucher for a later date?

### "full refund received"
Not Verified | We booked way back but guessed it would be cancelled due to covid. 4th July recieved notification of cancelled flight 5th July, completed the on line form for a full refund, 7th July full refund received. I can only guess that those complaining tried to obtain the refund by phone. If they survive, I will have no hesitation in booking for Miami next year. Other airlines need to see how Norwegian deal with things and follow.

### "waiting for full refund
Still waiting for full refund a full 4 months after they cancelled in April due to coronavirus. Customer relations department does not respond to any requests for information or updates.

### "Norwegian changed our return ticket"
Not Verified |  Norwegian changed our return ticket 1 day after arriving on Crete and removed 3 days of holiday. From 10 to 7 days holiday and even though there were several other flights we could have taken the same day as we were supposed to go they just didn't care and just presented us with a gun-to-the-head policy, where we either could choose to stay in Crete or go back 3 days earlier. The kids who had their first real holiday in years are devastated. And just for the record - I had already contacted Norwegian several times before to be sure there were no issues with our tickets in these corona times.

### "it is taking too long"
I bought a premium flex ticket so should have no reason not to get a full refund for a cancelled flight. I was expecting to fly on July 8, 2020 but cancelled due to Covid. I am still not getting refunded and called 3 times already and filed a claim with the airline but still not receiving my refund. They keep telling me to wait but it is taking too long.

### "waiting almost 7 weeks"
Norwegian cancelled my ticket because of covid-19 what is fully acceptable. I ask for full refund they writed me that it will take around 2-3 weeks to get my money back. After 3 weeks they sent me the same email to fill the same form to apply for money refund. I'm waiting almost 7 weeks. I call the service they told me just wait or choose a new flight instead.

### "website is as clear as mud"
Norwegian's website is as clear as mud. They  make it very difficult to find answers or contact them directly. I spent about an hour trying to figure out how to cancel my flight in June due to the pandemic. You'd think this process would be clear and featured given the current state of affairs. I found something that mentioned you have to cancel the flight, then apply for a refund. It was not specific. I cancelled the flight and then could not figure out how to file a claim. Come to find out, I had to wait to see if they canceled the flight. Now I have no recourse in getting my money back, even if they do cancel the flight.

### "cash points instead of a refund"
Gatwick to New York in June 2020. I would like to cancel my trip due to COVID-19, but Norwegian is offering cash points instead of a refund. Even without the pandemic I wasn't sure how long it would be until I got the chance to travel internationally again, but now with the virus my next flight is even more up in the air and I'd hate for $300 worth of cash points to just be sitting in my account for years. Calling is to no avail and there isn't an email that I can find for me to contact. This is very inconvenient for me and my family.

### "offering travel credits"
I called the booking site "FlyFar" today and allegedly the agents have been requesting refunds from Norwegian since last month. They are offering travel credits to fly by Dec. 31st 2020, when we do not even know when COVID-19 will end to make sure it is safe for us to fly. They refuse to process flights for those us who have been extremely inconvenienced by this COVID-19.

### "I found the process confusing"
Oakland to Oslo in October 2019. The flight was booked for a price of $803.51 round trip total for myself and my companion. For each leg, we were provided an opportunity to "Bid for an upgrade. For each leg, I intended to bid 10% additional (about $40 in each case) but I found the process confusing. I was shocked to find that I was billed a total of $1834.50 for the trip, which is a 128% increase in the fare as opposed to my intended 10% increase. I contacted Norwegian Air and was refused any adjustment. In the end, this confusing upgrade process and refusal to provide a reasonable settlement appears to be a corporate strategy to enhance the bottom line with no regard for customer satisfaction.

### "crew was nice, helpful and very friendly"
Dubai to Oslo. The check in went smoothly, the gate was remote though. We waited almost an hour, cause they waited an answer if they could bring transit passengers to Norway, which closed the country for foreigners that day. The plane was almost fully booked, but some free seats here and there. We sat in the second last row, and had a free middle seat. We sat pretty comfortable, the seat is not that narrow as i have experienced on other LCCs. The crew was nice, helpful and very friendly. I tried the free wifi only, it worked part of the way, pretty slow.We could have bought more speed for 5 eur, but i prefer reading books. We landed 20 minutes after schedule

### "matter related to Coronavirus"
Not Verified |  No meaningful customer service, no reasonable accommodations for matter related to Coronavirus. Took hours to get anyone on phone (hung up on rather than connected 4 times), agent knew nothing, website unclear This is a discount operation in every meaningful way related to interfacing with the airline.

### "absolutely terrible experience"
London Gatwick to Oslo. Terrible, absolutely terrible experience. Flight got cancelled while already ín the plane (with at that point already an hour delay). We got off loaded and basically not provided with any clear information for the next 5 hours. Currently, the replacement flight keeps being pushed. I’m lucky if I get out of here today at all. Staff is extremely unhelpful and unfriendly. Oh, and I got a voucher of 7,5£ to cover 8 hrs of waiting. 7,5£ in Uk will get me 1 water. I will never fly with you again.

### "crew seemed to be stressed"
Not Verified |  Malaga to HelsinkiThe ground handling at Malaga was polite and fast. The flight was on time. No word from the cockpit since airborne. The cabin crew seemed to be stressed, even it was their first flight of day. My leather seat was torn and partially broken. First flight with Norwegian without any wifi or IFE.

### "staff were useless in giving information"
Not Verified |  Everything was going well until a sand storm hit the Canary Islands. We were half way there and had to return to Gatwick. Norwegian staff were useless in giving information. They put us up at the Gatwick Hilton for the night and said that they would contact us with any updates. They did not do this. They gave us a phone number to call, waste of time because nobody answers the phone. They said that they would email us with updates, even that didn't happen. We have lost 1 day of our holiday and their attitude is tough luck. Other planes are flying out to the Canary Islands today. But Norwegian are not. They have not even offered another flight on another airline. Totally unhappy.

### "One of the worst airlines I have flown with"
Not Verified |  One of the worst airlines I have flown with. It was my first trip to Europe and I was ecstatic, that is until I had to deal with this airline. Their airline tickets were cheap but don’t be fooled, they will get their money from you one way or another. They weigh your carry on bags and personal items before you can board the plane. I was over the 10kg or 22lbs allowed and they charged $120 to check the bag (one way). They do not feed nor give complimentary drinks including water! You might as well pay for the air you are breathing. Other airlines charge a bit more for their plane tickets but at least you’re treated like a living human! How do they expect you to be on a 10hr flight without any food or water. I’ve learned my experience and will never fly Norwegian again.

### "Thank you Norwegian Air"
Not Verified |  New York JFK to Gatwick. Original flight booked with Norwegian Air was cancelled so we lost the price of our nonrefundable American airline tickets to JFK. We scheduled a later Norwegian flight and paid for two more airline American Airline tickets to JFK. Not happy that the original flight was cancelled but Norwegian did step up and reimburse us for the two original nonrefundable tickets to JFK. Was pleasantly surprised that Norwegian Air did this. Our flight from JFK to Gatwick was no frills but the plane was nice and it was a great value. Yes, we would fly Norwegian Air again. Thank you Norwegian Air.

### "was only 1.5 kg overweight"
Terrible airline, I’m not going to use it again. I was flying from Madrid to Los Angeles, we boarded and we had a 1.5 Hours delay. It’s around a 12 hour flight. They don’t serve free food or water. You have to buy it. The cabin was so cold. We ordered some food - my food was disgusting and expensive. The flight tickets were not cheap and in addition, there is no free baggage. I was carrying hand luggage and was only 1.5 kg overweight (allowed 10 kg) and they made me pay 90 euros for that.

### "I was very pleased with Norwegian"
Rio de Janeiro to Gatwick. I have flown to Brazil every year since 30 years ago when I moved to England. I have always flown British Airways. I understand why long haul flights are and can be so expensive, nonetheless I try to get the best price possible for a direct flight. I couldn't believe my luck to find out that a prestigious airline was providing a direct flight from the closest airport to me (1 hour away), and less than half of the cost for a round trip. The staff were very polite, friendly and smiley. I told them I was a nervous flier and 30 minutes or so after the take off one of the staff came and offered me to change seats to a less crowded part of the plane. The flight was very pleasant, calm and faster than expected. The entertainment was as good as the airlines I had flown for so many years. I didn't like the coffee but I never drink any coffee that is not a good Brazilian quality, produced and packed in Brazil. The food was not to my taste. The flight back from Rio was as good, and we arrived 22 minutes ahead schedule. I was very pleased with Norwegian and I will fly with them whenever I need to if they keep providing their services from Gatwick. Thank you. A happy customer.

### "flight was delayed by 4 hours"
Copenhagen to Gatwick. Our flight was delayed by 4 hours. The only communication I received was 2 text messages with approximate departure time. When arrived to the airport there was no a single representative of the airline to explain what was happening with the flight. In the text message they sent they asked to arrive to the airport at the original time and go straight to gate C36. You have to go through passport control and there is no way out. In that area there was no one to talk to passengers and explain what was going on. The flight kept being delayed and the only way to know it was to go online and see that there were new times. There was no information at the airport on the screen. They offered meal voucher but there was no one giving those vouchers out. They kept claiming via chat on Facebook this was due to the weather but other flights were going to either Heathrow or Gatwick.

### "arrived 15 minutes ahead of time"
Norwegian flight from Copenhagen to Helsinki on 07feb operated by Jet Time. Departed five minutes ahead of schedule and arrived 15 minutes ahead of time. Due to the shortage of planes Norwegian has wetleased a number of planes from other companies. Because of this issue this flight was operated by Danish charter airline Jet Time with a not entirely new Boeing 737-700. The plane was a little worn but fine for the short one and a half hour flight, The Jet Time cabin crew seemed to be a little less trained than Norwegians regular crew but they were smiling and helpful if people had questions. In general I would much prefer flying Jet Time rather than facing a cancellation due to the shortage of planes. However if you expect modern planes, decent legroom and wifi you should probably not choose a flight operated by Jet Time.

### "My roller bag was overweight"
Berlin to Oslo. My roller bag was overweight so could not be a carry on and I had to check it at a cost of 90 euros per leg. I have never had a good experience with their ticket counter, they are short with me and seem to be bothered by my mere presence. I would never recommend this airline.

### "staff were rude and unhelpful"
Not Verified |  Denver to London Gatwick. Stranded at 1am after an 8.40pm flight got cancelled. The staff delayed and delayed us with little information or compensation other than a meal ticket. When they finally cancelled on us, 700+ people had to find somewhere to sleep at 1am and they didn't fly us until the next evening. The staff were rude and unhelpful. Their contact center is useless, forget ever getting any compensation, and no tickets under any circumstances are refundable because this business doesn't support it's customers. Do not fly with them, no matter how good their prices are, once you finally board (and they're often late) the experience is less than satisfactory, TV screen didn't work, uncomfortable seats, terrible food, grumpy staff.

### "You have been warned"
Los Angeles to Barcelona. No, and if you do, do not say you were not warned. They have changed since they started having financial problems. They will get more money from you than you originally planned. It's their new thing. I read all the notices. I weighed my bags. They still got me for $880 in addition to the amount I booked for two tickets. They added upgrades without my approval. I was not given upgrades I had, even with an email proof. They were rude. They handled everything horribly. There were painfully long delays that were caused by the airline's incompetence. I'm really good at traveling on economy airlines. I don't need food and water. I don't need a lot of room. But I expect to be treated with respect, and I do not expect to be scammed. And forget about working things out with their customer service department after the fact. They have nothing to gain from refunding you diddly. If you are flying to Barcelona, take TAP - same price but they are a real airline. You have been warned.

### "we absolutely loved it"
Not Verified |  New York to London Gatwick. First time flyer with Norwegian, hopefully not the last. When I booked this flight, I read reviews after I had booked the flight and was horrified. This was for my husband’s birthday. However, we absolutely loved it. The airline was prompt, clean, all the staff were courteous from check in to leaving the plane. I would totally recommend flying with them. Flying home, we bid for premium seats and we lucky enough to get them, big seats lots of leg room, attentive staff. Please ignore all the horrific reviews. They were amazing.

### "made a mistake in a booking"
Copenhagen to Tel Aviv. Norwegian used to be my favorite airline, but I made a mistake in a booking, called to change it, and was advised to cancel the ticket and claim for a refund. I did that and was told a refund was not possible and a change of booking was  also not possible due to the cancellation of the ticket. Numerous approaches to their service department were met with the same robotic response that ignored my comments and used a "sorry for any inconvenience" template. What a shame and disappointment.

### "a great product for the price"
Have flown Norwegian over 30 times in the last year both short haul and long haul. This trip was a long haul from San Fran to Stockholm via London. I am a big fan of the airline. Almost always on time. Very friendly crew, especially in the long haul operation. Free wifi for all passengers regardless of ticket type (both short and long haul) and operates gate to gate (so no annoying need to log in and out on take off and landing). The premium offering long haul is, I would say, better than most airlines' premium economy but not as good as business class. Yet the price is exceptionally low for what you get. Essentially you pay about a normal airline's economy fare or less for an experience better than premium economy. The food in premium is high quality as are the drinks and the seats are good enough to get a reasonable sleep (although this is not a lie flat bed per business class). The IFE is modern and high quality albeit with a slightly smaller range of movies than a normal airline. Whilst Norwegian are no Ryanair, it is worth remembering that this is a budget airline. You are getting a major discount on long haul with a normal airline but in return you need to follow their rules. If your hand baggage weighs more than 10kg (or 15kg in premium) they will make you pay to check it in. In economy, you don't get a meal unless you pre-order and pay. Short haul they are more flexible with the rules on baggage but long haul they always check. Overall, a great product for the price.

### "I demanded compensation"
Los Angeles to Paris return in September 2019. We were notified of a nearly 3 hour delay the morning of departure, but told to arrive as if the plane was leaving at the scheduled time. We were told that our seats we had chosen 6 months earlier, were changed (we were separated in the cabin; I was in the front, he in the back!) because the airline eliminated our flight and put us on a later flight. We thought we'd hang out in the lounge. When we arrived at the lounge entrance, the receptionist said that only customers who paid for premium flex seats could have lounge access, unless we purchased the tix last December. I told her that we did purchase them last December, but she said I'd have to provide proof. On the flight home, the crew was very nice. Three hours before the end of the flight, an announcement was made that there was no more potable water. I demanded compensation, and Norwegian said they'd pay us $60 for our troubles, but we'd have to provide a routing number for our bank. I didn't feel comfortable with that request; I asked to receive a voucher in that amount for the next trip. The answer was  that was the only way they could send any money.

### "Seats so close together"
New York JFK to Gatwick. Seats so close together, it was the worst long haul I have flown. I did not see cabin crew other than to dish out two of the worst inflight meals I have had. One was a sandwich. Not sure what the other was (I paid 3 x £25) for them. No tea/coffee served to me. Save your money and buy something from the airport before you board.

### "hand luggage was too big"
Dublin to New York via Oslo. The main issue I had was with staff on the ground at Oslo airport, where I transferred from another European flight, operated by Norwegian. The bag I had flown with as hand luggage to Oslo was now too big to go in the cabin (Max 10 kg, Max 55x40x23cm). I was sent to a desk in the boarding area where they requested a payment of NOK 800. I explained I didn't understand what she said; her response was 'if you are sent here, you have to pay, that's it. I explained that I had just flown here on Norwegian, with the same bag. I asked her what she meant? It transpired she wanted me to pay her 800 Norwegian krone. I asked her what this was is US$? and she told me to look it up. I told her she was behaving rudely. She said 'I will deny you boarding if you argue  any longer!'. I flew 3 legs with Norwegian and I had to pay over $200 for hand luggage. The cabin crew were generally fine. As a low-cost airline amenities are non-existent and everything requires payment.

### "a cheap flight I suppose it’s great"
Miami to London Gatwick. First time flying with Norwegian, I was very unimpressed how they weigh your carry ons. I had a small pull along suitcase full of my babies essentials for the flight and was told it was too heavy and I would have to pay $15 a kilo my suitcase was over by 3 kilos also and the lady serving us just grunted pointed to the left and shouted go go come back when you sort. The flight was ok the seats were comfy, the TV was actually pretty snazzy and cool but on a long haul flight I was shocked that food is not included free. This is  a company that does not strive for positive customer feedback they offer  cheap flights and it’s a take it or leave it scenario. If you need a cheap flight I suppose it’s great however if your looking to start your holiday off cheery and happy I suggest flying with someone else.

### "seat is really up there at the top"
Gatwick to Miami. I was unable to check in using the app and was told in the app that airport check in was required at Gatwick this was surpringly swift. The Norwegian desks were straight ahead from emerging from the exit from the railway terminal at the South terminal. A quick stop at the kiosk to check in and collect my boarding card the machine without prompting also printed another boarding card that acts as your lounge access pass. Very efficient. There was no queue at the Premium bag drop so I was straight to the agent via the security officer asking the usual questions. Bag drop done in seconds and headed to security screening. Norwegian does not provide fast track security at Gatwick but this wasn't an issue as it was really quick and I was airside in about 3 minutes. Gatwick process and technology not making us remove laptops and liquids. The lounge offering for Norwegian Premium Flex customers at Gatwick is the third party MyLounge. Whilst smart and comfortable has a very basic F&B offering. But it was a relaxing way to start the day. I deliberately didn't board until nearer departure so again had no queue at the gate where there is priority boarding for Premium customers. Once on board and after easily finding stowage for my back pack I was offered a glass of water, apple juice or orange juice. A bit dull. A glass of even prosecco would have been well received! I had seat 1A by the window. This front row seat is by the bulkhead and whilst offers no extra legroom than the other Premium seats, the front row has a major advantage; no passenger in front reclining into your space. From my experience flying Premium on other carriers this seat is really up there at the top. The leather covered armchair is wide with about 46" seat pitch with a lot of recline and an extendable calf supporting foot rest. Whilst a flat bed it is not, it is very comfortable. The IFE comes out on a stalk from one of the arm rests and was easy to use. This even allows you to order drinks or snacks at your seat in between meal services. But I was surprised how poor and dated the choice of movies was. I really struggled to find something I wanted to watch. The inflight service did not start until we had departed about an hour. This was a drinks service and in Premium beer, wine and non-alcoholic beverages are free of charge throughout the flight. But if you want a cocktail you have to pay. I chose red wine though both wine offerings were low end. There are no pretzels, nuts or other snacks offered unless you're prepared to pay for them, which is a bit poor. The main meal was delivered about 30 mins later together with more drinks. As I was in the first row there was 3 choices available. I would say the food quality and quantity was on par with the likes of a BA Premium Economy meal, but it looked cheap as it is served in this flimsy long cardboard box holder with the entree still in foil and metal and very cheap plastic cutlery. The crew were responsive if you requested more beverages throughout the flight, but not particularly warm or friendly. About 90 minutes out of Miami a second meal service was offered. This was a salad with meat and bread rolls offered. Perfectly adequate quality and quantity as not the main meal. Again a full beverage service was offered identical to with the main meal. De planing was delayed by 5-10 minutes due to issues with the jet bridge. Bags delivered about 15-20 mins after clearing immigration

### "very easy pleasant flight"
Just returned from Orlando to London Gatwick with Norwegian. This was a last minute booking as we had an emergency back home, I was doubtful about using this airline however due to the issue back home I had little choice so we booked with them. I can honestly state that my doubts were unfounded and we had a very easy pleasant flight, everything went as it should. Food was as expected for airline food. We will definitely use this airline again without hesitation. Well done to you all at Norwegian keep up the good work.

### "A 2hr 35mins delay"
Oslo to Nice. After 1 hour delay due to weather conditions in Nice, we had an extra delay due to the long time it took to board,  and then an error in the suitcases that were loaded on plane, requiring to unload everything and reaload. A 2hr 35mins delay, arriving in Nice at 22.50, having missed my train, nothing was organised to help customers. There weren't an agent from the company at this time at Nice airport. I had to find a hotel, a taxi to and from the hotel which they will probably never reimburse. Appalling customer service.

### "have to pay to check the bag"
Gatwick to Los Angeles. I was stopped by the agents at the gate in Gatwick and informed that I couldn’t continue with my hand luggage and told I would have to pay 88 pounds to check the bag. When I tried to explain my confusion, I was told to step aside and that I’d be removed from the flight. When I called the customer service number and explained the situation, the agent could not offer assistance or explanation. When I agreed to pay the baggage fee, the gate agent berated me.

### "delayed due to weather"
The Amsterdam Schiphol drop off counter closed 3 hours before the flight, and no staff to let anyone know if we are even waiting at the right spot. Flight delayed by over 4 hours due to weather conditions, however the lack of staff at the gate to explain the reasons is inexcusable. Calling customer service was useless, as they suggested to follow the airport monitors.

### "we have 2 sectors cancelled"
Gatwick to Rovaniemi via Helsinki. Once in Helsinki, we are supposed to catch the 3pm flight. But one month before, Norwegian sent us an email saying the 3pm flight has now been changed to 10am on 1/12 when we are still in mid-air flying from London to Helsinki. No choice, we opted for their rescheduled flight Helsinki to Rovaniemi the next day. When we need a reason for their cancellation, as requested by our insurance company, they have yet to reply our online request. Our flight from Helsinki to Stockholm, Stockholm to Paris on 9/12/19 also met with the same fate of a flight cancellation. Taking no chances, we cancelled these 2 sectors totally and paid a premium for Air France flight. So out of 5 sectors booked with Norwegian, we have 2 sectors cancelled.

### "miss my Milan connection"
Fort Lauderdale to Milan via Oslo. The flight was over 3 hours late out of Fort Lauderdale, FL, which meant I would miss my Milan connection. In Fort Lauderdale they told me I may have to be bumped because I had a low fare ticket because they were using a different aircraft. I ended up getting on the flight and they told me I could make it to Milan. When we landed we had to go out of baggage claim to get help. They put us on a Brussels Air flight that connected through Brussels and into a different Milan airport 8 hours later at 10:15pm. They refused to pay for an overnight or help with transportation even though I may have to buy a hotel due to the very late arrival. They do not have free blankets or pillows onboard. It was the worst and cheapest in terms of low class, experience.

### "return flight was cancelled"
Chicago to Barcelona. While on our flight to Chicago, I was informed via text that our flight has been cancelled and they will be re-booking us for the next flight on the following morning. That was not going to work for so we decided to call up Norwegian customer service and communicate with the terminal representatives at O'hare that we are requesting a refund on the Chicago to Barcelona flight as we will be booking with another airline. Instead of getting our refund for the outbound reservation (I am still awaiting refunding for that reservation) we got refunded for our return booking from Gatwick to Chicago. We were not aware that our return flight was cancelled and refunded. I had no access my bank account to verify which flight was refunded as I was traveling overseas. Due to this, we were stranded at Gatwick Airport for our returning flight on 20th October and had to pay for a separate last minute ticket the following day through another airline. This caused a huge strain on us as we had to incur a very heavy cost on this error.

### "goodwill gesture was $270"
New York to Gatwick return. Norwegian has a promotion whereby one can bid to upgrade to a Premium seat. A few days prior to our return to JFK, we bid, and our $1275 bid was accepted and paid for, as we were notified by email. When we got to the airport, we discovered that our bid not been honored (there were no seats for us in Premium), but we had been put on stand-by. It was only after some heated haggling at the gate that we got seat assignments, but they were worse than our originals, and not contiguous. So a tremendous inconvenience, resolved only after much discussion. After many exchanges with Norwegian Air customer service, they refunded the $1275 upgrade bid. The goodwill gesture they were prepared to make for not honoring our bid, putting us on stand-by and then giving us worse seats than we originally paid for was $270. Pretty shocking.

### "a complete money grab"
Bangkok to New York via Oslo. Norwegian Airlines is the absolute worst airline on the planet. The ticket cost is cheap, but they will weigh your bags at the gate and charge you for almost any carry-on. There is nothing free during your flight. I was on an 11 hour flight from Bangkok to Oslo and was not even offered water. What was weird was that I brought a carry-on and a backpack on the flight from BKK to Oslo and it was ok, I was not charged anything but when I get to Oslo they weighed my bags at the gate and charged me $85 - it’s a complete money grab. They did this to about 100 flyers. This airline is a disgrace.

### "Hand luggage was 1 kg too heavy"
Oslo to Bergen with Norwegian. Hand luggage was 1 kg too heavy. Had to check it in at the gate. The CAD laptop which is 4kg had to be carried in to the plane without protection. The flight was taking place in a storm, and somehow the company found it safer to have the laptop loose in the cabin than inside a suitcase.

### "the worst airline ever"
This is the worst airline ever! I travelled from New York to London on Norwegian Air with my toddler and accidentally left my cellphone on board. It took them 4 whole days to recover the phone, and I won't waste time to mention the run around that I had to endure prior to this. Then, they sent me an email that I needed to pay £25 in order to get the phone back, which no one mentioned at any point. So, I went to the airport and talked to the Manager, and he was more eager to collect the money than to even listen to me, and his response was, "next time put up your stuff carefully. It's such a pity that I have to travel back with them, but never again! No matter how cheap the ticket is and I will tell my friends and family the same.

### "case weighed at the gate"
Gatwick to New York. I check in and was told I had to have my case weighed at the gate. The lady at the gate signaled me out and let other people with what appeared to be larger heavier cases in without weighing. My husband has a much lighter bag and she wouldn’t let me put anything in his bag. It didn’t make any sense as we were traveling together. I had to pay extra.

### "Flights have been good"
Gatwick to San Francisco. I have flown with Norwegian numerous times in recent years. Flights have been good, although delays seem more likely than with some airlines. Service on board is good - staff always friendly and helpful. Planes are clean and comfortable. Food is on par with other airlines - not particularly good, but pick around and you'll probably find something edible on the tray/in the box. Checking in used to be easy enough, but on recent trip to USA I was expected to type in endless details about where I was going and exactly where I was staying - not the sort of information you've got in your hand at the checkin terminal. I'd already provided all this advance information on their website. I recently cancelled a flight. The fare was non-refundable, but taxes are refundable. Norwegian made no effort to refund for over three months, and only did refund because I kept contacting them. Constantly ignoring my requests or fobbing me off. For this reason I give them a low score.

### "Really nice services"
Gatwick to Barcelona. Really nice services, great value for money. One of the best flights to Barcelona. Paid 120 eur for return ticket and I had 2 hold luggage included! Which other airline does that? Very nicely impressed, super new, clean airplanes. Great flight. For sure will fly again with them.

### "was so caring approach"
I was late to my flight from Gatwick to Malaga on 27 November at 09:05 AM and arrived to the gate after it was shown as "closed" on a live board. Not only they waited for me, but the Crew  showed so much understanding of my situation (as to why I was late and got to tears) . The quickly gave me a complimentary bottle of water and tissues, gave me the front seat and helped me to put my luggage on the shelf. All in all, it was so caring approach which I never really seen from any of the airline in my life. Thank you, Norwegian, and I will make sure I always fly using your airline where possible.

### "I told him to calm down"
Copenhagen to Gatwick in September 2019. Arrived in plenty of time for our flight. No luggage to check in so just sat around. Eventually the gate number came up and we were the furthest you could possibly get from that gate. My boy then decides now was a good time to want a wee. The toilets at Copenhagen were down a set of spiral stairs. So we had to leave our trolley and go down. When we get back up (trolley gone) he now wants a sip of water so I stopped and bought one from a nearby shop (very slow) as none of the machines had water at the departure gate on the way out. Next thing I hear is our flight number being called as last call. The girl at the Gate was very nice and said to relax as we weren't the last passengers to arrive. The guy at the plane started shouting at me about where we were sitting. Cross words were exchanged by both parties as I told him to calm down whilst I dig out the boarding passes. He said I shouldn't tell him to calm down and that he could bar me from the flight. He eventually gave in and let us on board. Later after we had settled in they were serving drinks and I asked for a glass of red wine to go with my meal. A cabin staff member said I was not allowed a drink. I asked why and was told "because he says so" pointing to the the small minded petty idiot I had met getting on. That man needs to address his anger management and have some customer service training. I can't give the airline a bad review because of one person that works for them but I can say he's not a plus point for the airline.

### "good value for the money paid"
New York to Copenhagen in premium cabin, return via Gatwick in economy. JFK-CPH sector Check-in was reasonably quick. No lounge offered (as it was an upgrade; lounge access is by invitation only for PremiumFlex category booking only.) Seat are configured 2-3-2 layout. The premium cabin was full and seat was comfortable even though it was not full-flat. Was able to sleep 4 hours straight with eye-shade on. Dinner was great (salmon option) and it took for a while to start so that passengers could sleep early as it was late evening flight. Breakfast was also sufficient. It was a great to have warm bread on board. It was on-time flight and luggage came out quite reasonably quick. I didn't use entertainment much as most of the flight I was sleeping/napping and eating. Flight attendants were friendly and efficient. Return flight was via LGW. CPH-LGW was on 737-800. Flight was non-eventful. Gatwick to New York was on Evelop Airlines (contracted charter equipped with A332). It was uneventful as well. Seat was comfortable for long-haul economy. Was able to sleep most of the flight. All in all, it was a good value for the money paid. Get to destination as scheduled with reasonable comfort.

### "nothing available without paying"
Buenos Aires to Gatwick on a LowFare ticket. It was a 13 hours flight. During the flight nothing was available without paying. There was a nice screen to watch movies and others, but we had to buy the headphones (4$). Even the blanket was 6$. The wifi was very expensive. On most flights there is like a hour free internet. I never recommend this airline for long flights, even if is a little cheaper.

### "unpleasant experience"
Paris to Oakland. We arrived Paris CDG check-in counter more than 3 hours before our flight. Despite this, we almost didn't make it. Norwegian had scheduled 3 long-haul flights very close to each other, as they don't have online check-in option, and there was only one line, it took more than half an hour to make it to the check-in kiosk. There were 2 attendants milling about to help folks at the kiosks. It was not clear if we could walk to the boarding gate right after getting our boarding passes. It was also not clear if there was a bag drop counter separate from people having other ticketing issues. Norwegian didn't post instructions to direct people whatsoever. Nonetheless, we went to counter to see if it was possible for us to sit together on an 11-hour flight. Instead, we were interrogated by a sour-faced counter attendant. First, she wanted to see my companion's onward flight out of the U.S. My companion showed her the Expedia ticket from her phone. The Norwegian attendant acted like it was a fake ticket. She couldn't locate the flight number from the ticket confirmation! So my companion pulled out her laptop to show the same Expedia confirmation on a bigger screen. The attendant still couldn't locate the flight number. Accusing her that there wasn't any flight number on the Expedia confirmation. Does this person work for an airline? How is it that she can't even find a flight number on ticket confirmation? After wrangling between the info on the phone and the laptop for over 10 mins, I finally located the onward flight number for her. (2) Now about the bags. I had paid for one 20kg checked bag. Turned out it was about 2 kg under the limit. The Norwegian attendant looked over at our backpacks and carry-ons. She proceeded to weigh every bag we were bringing onto the flight. There was no mistake that she was trying to find fault. We ended up being about 4 kg over between the two of us. Amongst this "excess" weight were some apples, sandwiches, snack bars, and bottled water. She held on to our passports and tickets and sent us away to figure out how to redistribute all the stuff in our packed bags. We ended up eating some of our apples and drinking our water while putting on extra clothes to lighten the combined weight. Sure thing, that Norwegian attendant played by the book. She didn't do anything wrong. But we were scrutinized like we were criminals. The unpleasant experience continued at CDG airport though it wasn't Norwegian's fault. There were only two officers at passport control to stamp every outgoing non-EU person's passport. By the time I arrived at the non-EU line, it looked like there were people from 6 long-haul flights lined up. At some point, only one immigrant officer was left stamping passports. I was in line for an hour and a half! Having already wasted almost an hour and a half at the Norwegian check-in counter, I made it to the gate only just in time even though we got there more than 3 hours before flight departure. The only points I am giving to this review had to do with the un-eventful on-flight experience. It wasn't unpleasant. And that says a lot to compensate for a very weak check-in experience in CDG.

### "customer service couldn’t help"
Nice to Oslo. Very poor customer support. The website couldn’t proceed for several days the payment with my foreign credit cards with 3D authorization. No proper explanation were given, customer service line couldn’t help. In the end had to book through another online service and the airline declined to apply my rewards. Wired service and absolutely unhelpful.

### "a pleasant flight and service"
Not Verified |  Tromsø to Oslo. Easy online booking engine. Everything stored in a own personal account, which is accessible through their homepage or own built app. Online check-in was made available 24h prior to departure, and as I had no checked luggage, I checked in online. 2h prior departure, I got a friendly welcome onboard sms with flight details. As I'd checked in online, I could easily walk thru security and wait at the gate given in the sms. Boarding was quick, as I had priority boarding bought and could get quickly onboard the aircraft. Crew greeting friendly, and inflight entertainment was what we could expect from a low cost carrier - want more wifi speed, you have to pay for it. Flight was ok, some turbulence but nothing to complain about. Pilot gave good information on why the turbulence occurred. All in all, a pleasant flight and service according to the low cost carrier expectation they gave me upon booking the reservation. Not reaching 10/10 as the fee's was a bit to harsh if you'd like to build your own reservation and fee for wifi usage onboard.

### "been really disappointed"
Buenos Aires to Gatwick. I have been really disappointed by this first experience with Norwegian. I am a frequent flyer and i fly every week and it was my first time experimenting Norwegian. And probably the last. Price wise i only had one leg with Norwegian, they are officially lowcost but in practice you still need to compare cause other companies can end up being cheaper even sometimes major ones. No luggage i was aware about that, but they did check the weight of my luggage and "too heavy you got to pay 120US$". Once in the plane, the crew was much more friendly (they may have contractors at Buenos Aires airport by forcing excess luggage fees) no issue. No free food = in the plane (westjet had small snacks), just water (3 times in 13 hours). Entertainment was good, nice tablet, reactive, okay selection for my 13 hours flight. Although this selection wouldn't have been enough for a second flight. For once very few disruption of the entertainment (BA loves giving you 5 minutes messages once in a while for example), you could watch your movies in peace. Flight wasn't full and a few could enjoy the use of an extra seat. So not that bad, but the bad luggage experience will make me consider any other options before considering Norwegian Next Time.

### "seriously disappointed by their customer service"
Not Verified |  London to Miami. I'm a frequent flyer, tending towards budget airlines (Ryanair, easyJet) where possible. I was under the impression that Norwegian was a level above these in terms of standards but have been seriously disappointed by their customer service which are the worst I have come across. In short, I was turned away from check-in for an easily avoidable issue (despite turning up 90 mins before departure), with nothing resembling customer service from the desk staff or the supervisor. Rather than helping me through the issues, I was instead pressured for time, despite having had no warning when check-in would be closing until 5 minutes beforehand. Having missed the flight, I was not informed of an option to reschedule flightls 30 minutes before departure - so have instead had to book another flight at full price. I was refused to see the manager on shift, who was apparently busy at the time. I received no apology for this, with staff taking an explicit 'minimum legal requirement' approach rather than taking care of their customers. I found significantly them worse to deal with than Ryanair and will be avoiding Norwegian where I can in future.

### "you will end up paying more with Norwegian"
San Francisco to Helsinki. I have flown Norwegian before and both experiences are similar. So you book your ticket which is cheaper then most other airlines offer but not by that much. Especially if you get all the additional they try and charge you for. If you want a similar experience to other competent airlines you will end up paying more with Norwegian. I mean they charge for everything under the sun, run the airplane cold so you will buy the blankets they sell you. The over priced meal is a joke. But what options do you have? Not to mention staff on every end from check in to the flight staff themselves treat you badly unless you pay for these extras. Overall staff are extremely rude on any interactions of any kind I have had with this airline. This is a horribly run airline and I would recommend any other airline over it. Trust me pay the little extra for a better airline avoid these people like the plague.

### "satisfied with the airline"
Not Verified |  New York to Copenhagen. After some reviews I was a little nervous about flying with them. But it was fine. The Boeing 787 is nice, the "mood lighting" is definitely a trip, and the seats were nothing special but ok. I will note that I am plus sized and the seatbelt didn't fit on this particular aircraft. It did fit on the flight I took from CPH-JFK a few days ago, so apparently it was the luck of the draw? Anyway, flight attendant was very nice about getting a seat belt extender for me. I could just barely get the armrests down but luckily no one was sitting next to me so I just left the armrest up for the flight. I also have mobility issues and walk with a cane, and I was supposed to have priority boarding but the plane arrived late so we boarded nearly an hour late, and they just did a general cattle call and everyone swarmed up to the gate. In spite of the late take-off, though, the flight should get to Oslo nearly on time. The free wifi is pretty terrible, and they don't give you free water. But knowing these things in advance you can bring your own food and drinks. Flight attendants on this flight were friendly and nice. Overall, despite a few glitches I am satisfied with the airline and would fly them again.

### "Schiphol shuffles low cost carriers around"
Amsterdam to Copenhagen. Arrived more than 2 hours before departure, checked in, went through security and waited in the lounge on November 7th. Shortly before boarding the gate was changed from D60 to M3. In the airport there are no signs to direct you to M3 and no staff could guide. To go from D60 to you M3 you have to exit through the baggage area and into an other terminal. Just saw the cabin door close when finally arriving at the new gate. Schiphol apparently shuffles low cost carriers around all over the airport in the last minute. Had to get a hotel for the night and buy an expensive last-minute SAS ticket to get home the following morning.

### "experience only gets better"
I have flown this airline many times and the experience only gets better. The crew have always been really friendly up in the air and the team on the ground are also very helpful. You see people complaining but this is normally because they haven't followed basic rules or fully understood what a "Low cost carrier" is. Norwegian is a great experience, comfortable with space. The WiFi is great and the Premium Packages are also at good value, I had an incident with it where my messages where taking about 30 seconds to send each time (not a big deal) and even though I didn't ask, they sent me a full refund about 2 days after my flight was taken. Apart from this, not only is it fast but the portal has Audio Books, Movies, TV shows and even allows you to Order duty free ahead of arrival at certain airports, as well as a "Things to do" and a "Moving Map". The crew actually care about the job and care for passengers. For example, a passenger got a coffee which was a little cold and instead of ignoring him, the Cabin Crew went and made him a fresh one instantly. This was really good service and was dealt with in an efficient way. The little extra touches also make a good difference and this will always be my airline of choice. I really hope they pull through the Winter Season and I hope that they continue to expand. To quickly summarise, you get a really good flight at a really low price.

### "nothing was complimentary"
My flight from Denver to Paris was 5 hours delayed. They didn't tell me what was going on until hour 4, which they chalked it up to mechanical issues. It was pretty clear at hour 3 I was going to miss my next flight in Paris with easyJet, I tried to get information on my options, but the person at the gate was rude. The flight was less than great, since nothing was complimentary, do my research before I book next time. Missing my easyJet flight from Paris. On my flight back from Paris to Denver, the flight was delayed an hour. I sent in my incident report to this airline to get reimbursed for the $150 I lost, and a month later they tell me it was out of their control.

### "exceeding the baggage allowance"
Oslo to Berlin. Some people were made to pay 75 EUR for exceeding the baggage allowance which includes duty free items. Incredibly rude and aggressive to me - told to either pay, leave the  bag or be denied boarding. You lost me as a customer.

### "my seat too tight"
Ft Lauderdale to Copenhagen. I'm a 1,83m, 85kg, average body, not fat. In a new Boeing 787 with 9 seat per row, my seat was too tight for a 10-hour trip. Obviously my shoulders were out of the seat, consequently, every time the hostesses passed, they woke me up. My food was scarce, and even the snack, having to order using the seat screen, charging sodas ($3.50 a can of soda).

### "why they can't refund"
I purchased 4 flights for my family three months before our holiday. Norwegian changed two of the flight times and instead of offering a refund are charging a premium to adjust my tickets to an alternate flight. I have had to re-book 10 tickets and pay twice now for each of the flights as Norwegian don't take responsibility for changing flight times if its 60 mins or less. I don't understand why they need to be adjusting flight times 3 months out and I don't understand why they can't refund my tickets 3 months out.

### "not eligible for refund"
New York to Paris on low-cost airline Norwegian. A few months ago we booked a trip from JFK to Paris France. We paid roughly $300 more a ticket so that we would not fly a budget airline. Roughly a week before our flight we received a text message that our flight itinerary has been updated. We wish to inform you that your flight DY7022 from JFK to CDG at 19.09.2019 23:15 will now be operated by Wamos A330-200. The departure time, flight number and booking reference is the same. We regret to inform that the inflight entertainment is limited on this flight. We are sorry for the inconvenience. We called and explained that we do not want to fly on that airline. The representative informed us that we would be receiving a 75% discount if we stayed on the airline and flew with Wamos and to file a claim which would be approved in 4-6 weeks. We decided to keep our flight and filed the claim. Shortly after we returned home we were asked to provide our bank number and other items for the refund. As soon as this information was given, we received a "Denied" claim stating that we are not eligible for this refund since we did not originally purchase class tickets. Please be careful with this airline.

### "unprofessional to me"
New York to Gatwick on low-fare ticket. Check in rude to me. Flight attendants unprofessional to me. Cabin freezing and they charge $8 for a blanket. Food is rubbish, my dietary requirements not available. Toilet I used was filthy. In-flight entertainment not working. So disappointed.

### "last 2 flights have been very late"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Oslo. I’ve flown 3 times with Norwegian in the last fortnight. Certainly if booked well in advance the ticket prices are reasonable until you have to factor in the cost of delays and late arrivals. I am tired of Norwegian being late. My last 2 flights have been very late and there were no trains from Oslo airport into Oslo when I arrived. It’s a real fiddle to try and claim the cash points also. The free WiFi if you can find out how to get on to it was hopelessly slow. Really frustrating.

### "Our bags were slightly overweight"
Oslo to Los Angeles. They performed a spot check and the luggage rule did not match what we had read online. We were connecting from another flight so we were unable to check bags at the gate. Our bags were slightly overweight and we were charged $78 to check one. This happened to other people on our flight, chaos ensued with lots of angry customers.

### "our flight was changed"
We have booked our tickets 4 months ahead of schedule from Newark to Rome. They informed us by email that our flight was changed to 2 days later for departure without any reasons. These changes will affect our schedule significantly. We have 2 options, we have to accept the changes or we have to cancel. We have also a connection flight from Rome with Alitalia.

### "strict requirements policy"
The flight is fine but the staff are only focused on strict requirements policy which has no evidence. My carry on was under 10 kg and the size was fine but the lady claimed it was 2 cm taller. She forced a fine of 75 euros for a small bag.

### "very impressed with Norwegian"
Not Verified |  London Gatwick to Tampa International. Overall very impressed with Norwegian. Easy to book flight - updates by e-mail. This airline has impressed me with the overall efficiency - ease of making changes, the check-in process, as well as the cabin crew and flight crew. Would definitely use this airline again.

### "staff of this airline are so incredibly rude"
Not Verified |  London to Chicago with Norwegian. The staff of this airline are so incredibly rude, I initially paid $50 to check in a bag (which I did) but my carry on luggage was a little over 3 pounds and they made me pay $100 to check the luggage. I tried to take out some clothes and put them on but he told me whatever I took out Id have to dispose of. I am furious! Not to mention you have to pay an extra $125 to upgrade your seat to get water and 2 sandwiches! Even Spirit gives you water and crackers! All I wanted was to go home and the man started telling me he would have me escorted from the airport, because I was so upset! I will never fly this airline again or recommend it to anyone I know. Oh also the flight attendants, that's a whole other story, just so stale and prude.

### "Very disappointed with our flight"
Very disappointed with our flight on Norwegian! Upon sitting down, we noticed it smelled like urine in our section. I visited the Midsection restroom before take-off and it was filthy! Urine all over the floor, and the sink area had not been cleaned. We were late taking off making our arrival to Chicago almost an hour late. The crew were very rude especially to some nationalities. Rude to those that did not purchase meal plan. A young lady beside me kindly asked for orange juice and water with her meal got 1/2 glass of juice and 1/2 glass water! Those that did not purchase were not even given opportunity to purchase a drink of any kind. I heard a hostess tell him no, you can’t when he asked to purchase. The only drink brought to us was small glass with our meal! There is no reason to charge extra for the type of food we received! There is also no reason in 10 hours that drinks cannot be served more than with meal. For free! Yes they had free WiFi but no where to charge your device! And they did not tell us we needed to download app till we were backing out! Also could not hear any announcements! Will not fly Norwegian again!

### "water was charged a fee"
Oslo to Munich with Norwegian. Narrow Seats / Beverages for a charge / Overweight Baggage. The only thing that stood out was free wifi access. During the boarding procedure passengers luggage were checked and charged €75, for overweight (max. 10kg total weight). During the flight water was charged a fee on this low cost airline.

### "rude, unsympathetic"
London to Seattle. My Mother passed away. I had to take an emergency trip to Bulgaria. I booked a flight back VAR - LTN/self transfer to LGW - SEA. VAR-LTN was serviced by WizzAir, LGW-SEA by Norwegian. I diligently paid for a checked-in bag of 50 lbs for the trip. I had a carryon bag and a backpack. My carryon bag contained my CPAP machine, my backpack the urn with my Mother's ashes. I had no problem with the baggage at the VAR airport. WizzAir crew and the Security personnel were kind and sympathetic to my grief. It was an entirely different story with Norwegian at LGW. When checking in my bag a very rude Norwegian representative told me I am entitled to only 20kg (about 44 lbs) instead of the 50 lbs I paid for and made me transfer 4 lbs of items to my carryon bag. He didn't care about my arguments or situation. Next I got to the gate and was apparently randomly selected to weigh my bags. My carryon was 18 kg, my backpack 8 kg. The Norwegian representative was again extremely rude, didn't listen and didn't care about any of my explanations! She made me pay 80 GBP and forced me to check-in my carryon. My carryon contained my CPAP machine (about 6kg), which is medical equipment and checking it in is illegal. I am entitled to carry it as a separate carryon item. The Norwegian representative was so bound to take the 80 GBP that she didn't listen and she didn't care. Without the CPAP and without the 2kg which I was forced to transfer from the check-in bag, my carryon would weigh the allowed 10kg. I would transfer some of the weight to my backpack if it wasn't for my Mother's urn of ashes in it. All of the Norwegian representatives at the gate were rude, unsympathetic to my grief and simply after the money. I noticed many people with obviously bigger and heavier bags than mine who weren't picked on. There was a lady with a camping backpack which was bigger than her and a regular backpack which she wore in front, she could barely walk. She was let through without weighing her baggage. It's apparent the Norwegian being a "budget" airline is trying to squeeze out the passengers for every cent and using extortion if needed. They don't care if your Mother died and about your grief. They don't care if your baggage is within the limits and that it's illegal by law to check-in medical equipment! I really wish I hadn't booked flight with Norwegian and I will avoid doing it for the future.

### "Very narrow seats"
Paris to Oakland. Reservation made by a third person. No notice that meals had to be pre-ordered. Simple snacks were charged at 7 Euro. Coffee charged at 3 Euro per cup. Normal carry on roll-aboard was weighed and made to check if over 10 Kg $100 at the gate and then we had to take to TSA baggage check. Baggage weight not a concern about weight as the same weight went on aircraft anyway. Baggage charge just a way to get extra money and limit overhead space. Had to carry bags up and down the stairs to/from bus transport. Very narrow seats with min legroom. Good things: Each seat location had a touch screen that provides entertainment as well as flight status updates. Have traveled United, American and Lufthansa to/from Europe in past and never had these problems. Will never fly Norwegian again.

### "this was not a Norwegian plane"
Newark to Rome. Norwegian subcontracted our flight so this was not a Norwegian plane. A 9.5-hour flight with no entertainment. I paid an additional fee when purchasing my tickets to select my seat in an emergency row for legroom (I'm 6'6") but because the flight operation was changed I lost my seat selection. Luckily I was able to talk myself into emergency row but this meant sitting far apart from my girlfriend who I was flying with and for who I had also paid the additional fee to choose seating next to each other. Could not get the fee refunded because the multiple times I've called Norwegian a recording answers saying all representatives are busy and cuts the line. You will not be offered to wait and can not give a call back number. How is this level of non-service even possible for an airline of this size?

### "No accommodation provided"
Copenhagen to Madrid. Flight scheduled 20:20, delayed to 22:40 due to technical problems Then announced departure postponed again to 0:00 due to crew having reached maximum working hours. Then moved to 03:00, 03:50 and then announced it could not fly because there was no available crew until 06:00h. No accommodation provided. When the airline knows with so much anticipation they will need a fresh crew the excuse given is simply unacceptable.

### "Incompetent airline"
Not Verified |  London Gatwick to Orlando with Norwegian. Incompetent airline. Significant delays both ways and are somehow unable to make time up in the air (like every other airline would). In fact, the flights took longer than were advertised. Missed connection as such. Never again.

### "worst don't care airline"
New York to London. Please do not travel this airline. It is the worst experience ever including airport customer services. Not only they were late with no updates. The people, transport, hotel and hotel in England were all inconvenience another debt along with still charging me $100 for an underweight bag. I am losing 3 ways and the airline refuse to help in any way. Most of the counter staff looks angry and unhappy. I really, really did not want to travel again on my first trip to England. That is the worst don't care airline ever. Not happy customer

### "$100 at check in for overweight bags"
Not Verified |  Boston to Gatwick. The fare appears inexpensive but they have many add ons, charging for example for earphones and blankets. The baggage policy is ridiculous charging $100 at check in for overweight bags which has no justification. The staff do not engage and seem uninterested. Range of entertainment is poor. Will never fly them again

### "provide exactly what they promise"
Oslo to Longyearbyen-Svalbard. Budget airline that offers good no frills travel. Clean cabin, modern aircraft, efficient and friendly service, free WiFi, comfortable discuss seating. They provide exactly what they promise and at a very reasonable fare. Compared with other budget airlines I have to say Norwegian is one of the best I've experienced. Just be sure you realize that you're not getting business class service and you'll be happy.

### "don’t offer any free food or drink"
Round trip between San Francisco and Gatwick. Beside it’s strict carrying on suitcase policies, they don’t offer any free food or drink, they charge you everything, the earphone for the movie and the blanket etc.I can’t believe we paid over $900 for each ticket, and also need to pay the checkin luggage, the food, and a blanket etc.

### "flying passengers not cargo"
Rome to Helsinki. There are airlines around the world which handles delays and cancellation smoothly without little or technically zero passenger discomfort and then comes Norwegian. This is the second time I am travelling on Norwegian and the same problem, delays. But still, I can still live with that. But the process of informing the passengers is appalling. For a good one hour before the delayed departure, I literally had no clue which gate the flight was scheduled and to my disbelief, the airport app said the flight has already departed (I have the screenshot to prove that). I had to literally scramble twitter and customer care number of Norwegian and that too proved useless. I mean who is operating the airline? Do we have humans in place or there are robots running the airline? My wife was extremely worried and was trembling at times, later on, she walked to one of the gates of Norwegian departure to Stockholm. She guided us to the gates. The harassment (yeah more to come) was still not over after the boarding into the bus and into the aircraft you place your hand baggage and relax on your seat to find out the aircon is off. The flight attendants were quick enough to command you no to stow extra baggage in the overhead compartment but had less compassion of the passenger suffering. I was choking and gasping for fresh air. Alas, had to fan myself using the magazine. Now finally the aircon has come up and the flight is again delayed by 30 more minutes. I am writing this review from the aircraft and believe me I am extremely flustered and disappointed. Norwegian you are really sad. Keep in mind you are flying passenger and not cargo.

### "smooth landing and very nice staff"
Athens to Copenhagen. We left a bit late due to the late arrival and then because of restrictions imposed by the air traffic control, we left 50 minutes later, arriving in Copenhagen at 00.55 instead of 23.55. Flight was perfect, smooth landing and very nice staff. Unfortunately due to the problems with the delivery of Boeing 737 Max 800, Norwegian must rent other companies aircrafts.

### "flight was canceled again"
Tel Aviv to Newark through Barcelona, first flight landing at Barcelona around 4pm and leaving for the US at 6.25pm, Nice connection. When I checked in in Tel Aviv I was informed by the girl at the counter that my Barcelona - Newark flight had "disappeared" (an actual quote) from her screen, no reason giving other then "flight disruption". I am a seasoned traveler for over 25 years, this was a first. I was told that I would have to land at Barcelona and enter Spain, Pick up my luggage and try to rebook a flight - in other words, I was left to fan for myself. No one in Tel Aviv could help me. Naturally, envisioning myself stranded in Barcelona, I got a hold of an out of country costumer service number for Norwegian who had me on hold forever. Throughout this ordeal (which is not over as I am writing this and praying that this Norwegian flight will not be canceled) I found out that the people that work there are kind, polite, caring, and genuinely want to help. From that first rep on the phone, to Beatrice the flight attendant who got on the phone for me and kept me informed, to Diego at the Barcelona counter. All of them wanted to help me, the problem is - Norwegian. While I was flying from Tel Aviv, the company sent me an alternate route that was leaving at 3.10pm from Barcelona, I was on a flight that lands after 4pm. When I got to Barcelona I had to enter Spain, get my luggage and be informed that I will be able to leave only 24 hours later. They did give me hotel and meal vouchers, but did not pay for a late checkout. There is no apology, no mention of compensation for my trouble, my lost day, the money I spent while on hold on the phone. 6 hours later and my flight was canceled again, so I booked another flight, with another airline, this is costing me a fortune.

### "no complementary food or beverage"
San Francisco to Gatwick. During our flight there was no complementary food or beverage. Water was at a charge of $3. Food was on request and at a charge - no free snacks. I asked for a glass of water from the tap and they said I had to buy a $3 bottle. If you wanted food you have to select it in advance and pay for it in advance when you book the flight - I never knew about this. Also if you do not book a hot meal in advance they don’t even give you an opportunity to book one on the flight.

### "told her I have a right to two carryons"
Newark to Rome. Arrived to check in my flight with two carry-ons. Immediately the staff said this is a small flight and the captain and stewardess ask everyone to check in their carryons. I told them one of my carryons had computers and medicine and I could not check it in. She said I’ll make an exception but the other one had to be checked. In. I said ok thinking there would be no charge but the next sentence was its $100. I told her I have a right to two carryons and she proceeded to give me a hard time and threaten me with airport security or canceling my flight.

### "Really pleasant experience"
New York JFK to Amsterdam. Really pleasant experience with the Boeing 787 and everything on the airside and during the flight. Negative side of this experience was at the airport (JFK Terminal 1). Queuing time was so bad, people were waiting hours for a check-in, since online check in was not possible. If you have economy ticket I advise you to be at least 4 hours before your flight, so you can make it to the check in. I am aware that in the 2 hours there were like 6 departing flights, but this is something that you can sort it with either arranging the check in online possibility, or hiring more check-in counters. 7 Check in counters for 6 flights are not close enough for this amount of passengers.

### "no compensation on taxis or bus"
Not Verified |  Edinburgh to Oslo on a Sunday night which was 2.5 hours delayed. The airline gave no apology at the airport (apart from the pilot) or explanation or information about what plans there were. When we arrived, it was so late, there was no public transport from the airport and taxis in Oslo are outrageously priced (as in 3x what I paid for the flight to drive 30 mins to my house). They offered no way of getting home apart from one bus to the centre of Oslo, no compensation on taxis or bus to take people home. Appalling service. You cannot just dump people 3 hours late at an airport with no transport to get home until 8 hours after they were meant to have originally landed. I have work the next day, I am exhausted and they speak to you like you've caused the problem. Learn some manners and put some mechanisms in place for people to get home ASAP in such circumstances. Pay for taxis, pay for additional coach to drop people off.

### "never fly Norwegian again"
Gatwick to Orlando and return flight from Miami to Gatwick. Flight to Orlando was carried out by Hifly and return flight was carried out by Privilege. Both flights were serviced by ageing aircraft. We had no in flight entertainment on either flight, which isn't great on an 8 hour flight. Planes were both dirty and interiors very tired and worn. Staff on both flights seemed incompetent. Would never fly Norwegian again.

### "clearly doesn’t care"
Orlando to Copenhagen return. Flights, seats, meals booked/protected well in advance At day-before-departure check-in, discovered that Norwegian had changed our plane and seats to a  less-preferred location. Next day at MCO Departures gate, 2-each small checked/carry-on bags were each over weight by a few tenths of a kilo. Agent forced us to re-pack all 4 bags in lobby, so they were of even weight. We got to the Departures gate 1.5hrs early, to discover just before scheduled departure that the plane would be delayed. We sat there for almost 3 hours before departure. After repeated attempts to follow up a refund from their guest relations folks, we received an e-mail today, two months later, crediting us $180. Norwegian clearly doesn’t care.

### "rerouted us to HiFly"
Not Verified |  New York JFK to London. I will never fly Norwegian again! They rerouted us to some airline called HiFly which is a horrible Portuguese carrier. They have no customer service skills. They delayed our flight by two hours and didn’t bother to tell anyone the plane hadn’t arrived until 2 hours in. We are still waiting at the airport and there is no sign of the plane. They have not offered any compensation to these tired customers some of whom are infants!

### "they weighed every single item"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Orlando. We've flown Norwegian 6 times now but after the experiences both to and from Orlando, we will never book with them again. Firstly, the flight out was delayed by almost 6 hours by the time we took off. At no point were we offered so much as a glass of water by Norwegian staff - it seems that if they announce your gate number and make you sit there for 2.5 hours (on top of the first 3.3), they don't have responsibility for the smallest of courtesies. The plane was not the Boeing 787 when we booked. I understand they are having some issues with these planes but they could not have gone for a more 'budget' option if they tried! The seats were small and cramped for legroom and the in flight entertainment system didn't even turn on. The food was terrible - I don't expect the best meal of my life on a plane but it was horrible even by plane food standards. Again, this has not been our experience on previous flights. On the return journey, they weighed every single item for every passenger. Given that they only had two staff operating the check-in desk, this took an inordinate amount of time! Every case which was overweight had to be repacked by each passenger at the desk too - absolutely ridiculous! The family in front of us had one case weighing 23kg and one weighing 16kg. They were not allowed to 'spread' the weight over the two cases combined and instead had to take items out at the desk. They also weighed all hand luggage and the same rule applied. Fortunately, our cases were not overweight but we did have the same issue where one was heavier than 20kg and had to move some items from one case to another. I have never ever experienced this before and, whilst there may be perfectly valid reasons for this, having two staff operate the check-in desk was simply woefully inadequate. Inadequate is really the term to describe the experience and service from Norwegian. What happened to this once brilliant airline?

### "better experience coming back"
Gatwick to Denver. The rating is based on the flight coming back from Denver.If I base it on the flight going over you'd be staring at 1 star. Outward- I bought my ticket directly from Norwegians website, so no 3rd party etc. I bought exit seat 30A and I upgraded my ticket to make sure it covered the extra luggage allowance (20kg) as I was staying in Colorado for nearly 3 months. When I boarded the plane I was quite shocked at how old the plane looked, there was no entertainment, my exit seat was awful, my left leg was trapped due to the poor design of the exit door, so I had to sit diagonal, which meant encroaching on my neighbours space. I later discovered that this plane was operated by Wamos air? I think it was a rental plane. The staff were rude and seemed very disinterested. Lucky for me I had a great neighbour, we spoke for nearly 10 hours, laughing at the situation trying to come up with a good reason to give the flight any decent rating. I did like the colour of my head rest, it was red. The food was awful and the staff forget my neighbours drink and mine, he ended up sharing what little I had left in my water bottle. I hope nobody blames Wamos for being late and everyone heard the announcement that France (28th May) were having a tantrum/airstrike, which meant limited air space etc. This wasn't the fault of Wamos and they did inform us. On the return I was sad to see my ticket had Wamos air again. I was going to cancel and book a different company, but, my journey was only 8 hours long this time so I decided to get on with it. I'm happy to report this plane was much better, it looked new, entertainment was provided, the staff were super lovely and the food, I don't eat plane food so I gave mine to my new neighbour who didn't upgrade, he had nothing with him but the vegetarian dish looked lovely. Overall a much better experience coming back.

### "My bag was 1lb over"
Gatwick to Chicago. As a low-cost airline they charge everything - food, drinks, blanket, headphones (that broke right away), baggage, etc. The selections of movies was minimal. I was even more disappointed on how the ticketing guy at the Norwegian desk at Gatwick airport treated me. My bag was 1lb over and he made me take things out. His demeanor and the way he spoke to me was extremely rude.

### "just over an hour late"
Helsinki to Gatwick. The flight is due to leave just over an hour late. Had to stand inside the bus waiting to board outside the plane for 25 mins. The plane was filthy on boarding.

### "happy enough with Norwegian"
Oakland to Amsterdam via Copenhagen. The price is right! Which also translates to: plan for some upsets (like scheduling changes). However, you can also rely on some pretty impressive "make goods". Flight ex Oakland (near San Francisco, USA) delayed by 5 hours. Notification was well in advance with offer to rebook, full refund, or meal vouchers at the airport. Advice did not include how the delay affected connecting flight Copenhagen>Amsterdam which, after an almost 1hr wait on the phone, discovered was delayed by a further 24 hours. Not great if you absolutely have to be where you need to be, on time. Flights out same time-ish on alternate airlines were more than 3-times the price. However, Norwegian provided overnight accommodation at Copenhagen's Clarion Airport hotel with meal vouchers, and happily changed me to an earlier flight than they had rebooked to Amsterdam, but which was longer, via Stockholm. I was impressed with Norwegian's "without question" assistance and breadth of options in the face of such an inconvenience. Plane was old, and worn-&-torn seats showed its age the most: uncomfortable vinyl with deep depressions. Luckily on ours, most passengers snagged a 2 or 3 configuration alone, alleviating the discomfort. WiFi on the plane was free! Baggage Policy relates to Fare Type, so check which one suits you best before booking (Checked luggage is only 20kg) and an additional bag cost 93 Euro! I was happy enough with Norwegian and super happy with their pricing. I would book again if timing on my travel wasn't imperative.

### "they booted my wife to economy"
What a flaky airline. I booked two tickets in the premium (business class style seats) almost a year ago and due to a plane change (for some reason they’re contracting with Wamos now) they booted my wife to economy. And of course we all wonder if these guys will go under soon due to their financial woes and low customer satisfaction.

### "Absolutely awful experience"
Not Verified |  Absolutely awful experience. We were looking forward to our family trip to Miami from London. A few months before our trip we were contacted by Norwegian to say our flight would be operated by Prestige Style. We didn’t think much of it as I would assume that the aircraft, service and amenities would have been the same or better than the advertised flight we selected and paid for. On the way out from London we flew on the Norwegian Dreamliner, the staff, entertainment food was all good. Infact we liked that we could select our drinks and snacks when we wanted the them. The films and games kept our family of five amused for the 8 hour flight. Our return flight was the one operated by Prestige Style. What a difference. It was delayed, a very old aircraft with small uncomfortable seating. The entertainment was so old I can not do it justice, must have been 25 years old. The head phone points didn’t work properly. The flight attendants were rude, unhelpful and snappy. We had ordered a meal and it was cheap and disgusting, however at least we got some water, and a tea with this. The passengers who did not order the pre paid meal were not allowed a drink until we had been in the air nearly two hours. We were provided no information on the plane, menu or entertainment and for the most part we saw no flight attendants. It honestly felt like the passengers were an inconvenience and should be forgotten. However the worst thing about this plane was it felt unsafe, twice during take off and tubulance the overhead lockers opened and lougage fell out. At landing the captain announced that we should familiarise ourselves with the emergency exits and leave our personal belongings! I am not a nervous flyer but this was frightening. I am totally disappointed that an airline like Norwegian can sub contract out its flights and put them in such sub standard planes with such awful service. In a industry where reputation is so important it will not maintain customer loyalty. I can see from other reviews this is a frequent occurrence.

### "charged twice for my suitcase"
New York to Gatwick. A few days prior to our flight they switched airlines on us. We flew on a very old liner that did not have inflight entertainment. Not the worst situation sure but it was supposed to be on the plane and it is a long flight to London. The cabin was so hot the entire way as if the air was broken, the food options were limited and terrible, and the stewards were a disaster with their service. I had a friend in a broken seat and they wouldn't move him to a seat that would sit straight up in premium economy because his ticket was booked for economy. After our trip I noticed I had been charged twice for my suitcase, 200 dollars for one suitcase. The airline denied refunding me saying that I was charged for both people under my reservation. However, the other person in my reservation did not check in with me at the airport. He checked in with another friend flying with us and her ticket allowed two free checked bags so he checked his under her name.

### "75€ per carry on\2
Oslo to Vienna. This was the most gruesome inflight experience I have ever had. After having my carry on baggage cleared during check in in New York, on boarding in Oslo customers had to reweigh their bags. After trying to explain to the ground crew that my baggage was cleared, I was told that I can either check in my baggage for 75€ or throw away enough until I meet the weight requirements, all the while some customers pass through without being checked. After repeatedly telling them I am not going to pay as I would have gladly repacked my bags in New York where I could have redistributed the weight, I was told that I have to calm down, and pay or leave. They also kept repeating, that it was an issue of space in the cabin. However upon boarding, it was clear that there was more than enough space for carry on. And so, 75€ per carry on is plainly ridiculous.

### "Very disappointed"
Not Verified |  London to Miami. Very disappointed with Norwegian flight operated by Privilege Style. The seats were uncomfortable with little or no legroom with a box below the risers preventing rest for a long ride. It was an older plane, dirty and many seat problems. Second time we travel with Norwegian, and we pay for their service. We hope this will not be repeated again.

### "rudest flight attendants"
Newark to Barcelona. Had high expectations. All the advertisement of innovative strategy and new planes. Booked flights for me my wife and 3 weeks old baby. Did the check-in at the desk (so they assigned our seats). Needless to say, we had the baby in the booking and the person on the desk clearly saw the baby. Boarded the plane only to find out we had not been assigned the seats at the front where the baby bed is mounted. Ours was the only baby on board. When asked the hostesses why, they said you have to get these seats to use the baby bed, and it was the responsibility of the desk employee to do it. But they promised to arrange something. Not only they didn't, but in seven hours of flight, they never even passed to ask whether we were ok with the baby. Do these people hate babies? Honestly the rudest flight attendants we've met. We thought we would be given the baby bed and seats by default. In no moment of time, either during the booking online or at the check-in desk were we offered those seats, for free or for a fee. So they just threw us at some random seats and kept the baby bed in storage for no apparent reason. I've continuously read Norwegian is close to failure. I swear I am a positive person, but I confess I won't be sorry to see them go. And all the fuss about the Dreamliners; thin cushions and narrow seats. But yey, thr window is larger and has a cool dimming effect.

### "they do not provide free water"
Not Verified |  Rome to New York. After departure the crew said the price for the earplug was 3 dollars so you had to pay for it. During the flight they do not provide free water. We had the meals with half glass of water and thats all.

### "changed to an alternative carrier"
Gatwick to Miami  operated by Privilege Style. The advice I received in April from Norwegian staff via telephone was that an individual could not be taken off a booking, but the whole booking must be cancelled and re-booked without that person. This is the only reason I included my wife (who I knew could not travel) when changing the return flight. It was 6 days before departure via telephone that I was told I could remove my wife from the booking without cancelling the whole trip. This led to unnecessary increased costs in paying for a change for my wife on a flight I knew she would never be able to make. Norwegian advertised this flight as being on a Boeing 787 aircraft with the lastest entertainment systems etc, they changed to an alternative carrier, Privilege Style, which used an ageing Boeing 777 with no usable entertainment, no menu, no safety demonstration apart from pointing out the exits, no inflight magazine, and very few flight crew members. The outbound flight was bad enough, but on our return flight we were seated behind a seat underneath which could clearly be seen discarded food and bits of card. Written complaints were made to Privilege Style  regarding the flights we experienced. Responsibility for all the issues raised (including discomfort, filthy and smelly cabin, lack of entertainment, lack of amenities advertised by Norwegian etc) were laid with Norwegian by Privilege Style. While I accept Norwegian cannot guarantee exactly the same flight experience surely a great deal of effort should be used to ensure that passengers experience something of equal, or better, quality when changing what passengers should expect at the time of their booking. If I had known I would be travelling with my 9 yr old son on an old plane with no entertainment for a 9 hours plus flight and, on the return, be flying in a filthy cabin, I would never have booked this trip. Norwegian Airlines - new age Pirates of the Sky.

### "You get what you pay for"
My most unpleasant flight experience. Norwegian did not allow to check-in online for the flight and as they understaffed their counters, I waited +1 hour to face an uninterested guy. When I finally made it through hellish security - wow JFK - I encountered a crew that gave off the vibe of not wanting to be there. When I asked about my pre-ordered meal, he said I wasn't on the list and moved on. Snacks were depleted within the first 30 min of flight so I had to make do with some crisps. As I had laid down my head on the tray table in an attempt to find a comfortable position, a flight attended actually knocked on the table to point out the empty box of crisps that was previously under my seat had made its way onto the aisle. Instead of picking it up she just looked at me in disdain. You get what you pay for, but I do expect some basic courtesy. I've never felt more like cattle and will avoid booking with this airline. The only plus here was the aircraft itself.

### "paid seat selection was changed"
Ft Lauderdale to Krakow via Copenhagen. Impossible to contact their customer service to discuss flight changes. After multiple attempts and long wait times I was finally connected to an extremely rude representative. Not only was he unable to help me with my request, but discouraged me In my attempts to change my flight. My paid seat selection was changed from 8F to 35E.

### "musical instruments are special luggage"
Gatwick to Tenerife. I booked my flight through the app and I paid extra for checked luggage because I was carrying my guitar with me. There is no information saying that musical instruments are special luggage and I needed to pay £45 extra. I went to make a complaint and the lady said: Did you book through the app? I said: Yes, she said: there is no information about it only on the website. Then I said: so, I wont pay right? She said: Yes you must pay anyway, but you can make a complaint on the website, then she gave me a a paper card with the information. At the gate, they were checking the weight of all passengers luggage, your 2 bags together must have 10kg maximum and many passengers were charged extra.

### "hand luggage that was 3kg over"
Orlando to Gatwick. Purchased "Hand luggage only" ticket, I forgot to weigh hand luggage that was 3kg over. I had to check in hand luggage at cost of US$ 140. I asked if I could just throw out some books to make the weight, but told no repacking allowed at gate. Just a little bit too cold to get to sleep on plane, but jumper in  hand luggage that I had to check in. Norwegian supplies blankets, but charge for them. Arrived about 1.5 hours late. I would have just caught the bus I was booked onto. However, I missed it waiting for the luggage I had to check in. I have no objection to budget airlines charging separately for items. However, US$140 is vastly more than the cost of transporting a small carry on suitcase. Looks like Norwegian are the long haul equivalent of Ryanair. My first and hopefully last time flying Norwegian. The angriest I have been while flying for about 30 years.

### "charging for carry on"
My 14-year-old daughter had to pay $100 to check her carry on bag from New York to Gatwick. They same bag she flew to NY with on Norwegian and took it on as carry on. About a half hour after her initial flight took off from Gatwick to NY, the airline sent a message saying that the flight would be delayed more than two hours. This is after it took off more or less on time and was in the air. This naturally caused a lot of concern as I feared there may have been a technical problem and they were going to be forced to land somewhere. I phoned the airline and was left on hold for more than 20 minutes. I finally got someone on the phone, explained the situation and gave her the flight number. She looked in the system and told me that flight had already arrived in NY. This was about half an hour after taking off from London. I explained how that would be impossible and explained again that the airline had sent us a message that the plane would be two hours late. I was put on hold for another 10 or 15 minutes and she came back and said the flight was on time and she did not know why they had sent the message, the call cost me 38 pounds. It's probably just another way for a low-cost airline to make you pay more like charging for carry on, or 25 pounds for an inflight meal

### "an overall great experience"
Gatwick to Reus. We left our gate on time, the crew were friendly and it was an overall great experience. The Boeing sky Interior is a nice addition as well as the free WiFi, it was a shame they only turned it on half way through the flight, however it remained on even after we had landed and we were disembarking. The on board menu was fairly expensive. £2.50 for a packet of crisps or £9 for some milk chocolate (I assume it was a large bag). Crew where professional and approachable at all times. The seat was really comfy, plenty of storage and legroom as well. Thank you Norwegian for a great flight and looking forward to seeing you on the return leg!

### "forced us to check in carry on luggage"
Madrid to Boston. The staff were unfriendly and forced us to check in our carry on luggage and paid €80 for eachs. Then before boarding I was giving to the staff our boarding and passports to check us for all 5 of us and he was rude with attitude he said "each one of you should be holding their own passports and tickets on their own hands". Hello, we're traveling as a group. Then the stroller we as usual handle the stroller by the door expecting to receive it in the same place when we arrive but they sent it down to the usual baggage carousel after wait on front for it for over 20 mins, they told that was down in luggage.

### "plane was late both ways"
Not Verified |  Helsinki to Alicante. We've flown with Air Norwegian a number of times. However, this time the plane was late both ways. On the way back we tried to order food but they only had 1 hot meal (other than noodles). They said that they weren't given any on departure. Also, the air vents and light above our seat hadn't been cleaned in some time.

### "I didn't catch the first flight"
Berlin to New York via Stockholm. When I arrived to the airport, I found my ticket was a standby because they overbooked the flight. I went to the gate, purchasing some last-minute souveniers for my nieces. When I arrived, the gate agent saw that I had an extra bag and told me I had too much luggage and that I needed to pay for it. I said that I did not feel it was justified and asked to speak to a manager. When I asked to pay, she refused to allow me to pay. I left the airport and tried to catch my connecting flight to NYC. When I arrived in Stockholm, I found that the flight was full, and since I didn't catch the first flight, they did not list me as a passenger on the connecting flight. The airline has refused to offer any refund, compensation or to allow me to fly stand by on another flight.

### "drinks and snacks were not free"
Madrid to Los Angeles. I attempted about 3.5 hours pre flight to check in a bag online, however I found out cannot be done within 4 hours of flight. I went to the help desk at the airport and was told I had to pay a penalty fee of 80 euro for my bag. Onboard the flight I knew meals were not included but was surprised that drinks and snacks were not free with this low-cost airline. I asked for a blanket and was told there would be a charge. That all being said the airplane itself was new, and clean. And I really enjoyed the extra large sized windows.

### "charges for blanket, headphones"
Terrible experience with Norwegian. We bought the flight more than two months in advance and twenty days before flying they canceled the flight offering us an alternative to leave one day later, assuming on our part the extra expenses. We agreed and today, July 29, 2019, after having to request one more holiday day for Norwegian's last minute changes, we are in Stockholm on the flight, which should have left at 19:20 and it's 19:55 we're still here. Compared to other international flight company, it charges for blanket, headphones, food, water. Our trip Madrid-Hanoi the icons with Qatar for a similar price and all these extras were included.. Pésima experiencia con Norwegian: Compramos el vuelo con más de dos mese de antelación y veinte días antes de volar cancelaron el vuelo sin ofrecernos más alternativa que salir un día más tarde, asumiendo por nuestra parte todos los gastos extra. Accedimos y:  Hoy, 29 de julio del 2019, después de tener que solicitar un día más de vacaciones por los cambios de última hora de Norwegian, estamos en Estocolmo en la escala del vuelo, el cual tendría que haber salido a las 19:20h y todavía siendo las 19:55h seguimos aquí. Por tanto, vamos de nuevo con retraso! Comparado con cualquier otra compañía de vuelos internacionales ofrece una pésima experiencia de viaje, cobra absolutamente por todo: manta, auriculares, comida, agua... esto en vuelos de más de 20 horas. Nuestra ida Madrid-Hanoi la iconos con Katar por un precio similar y todos estos extras estaban incluidos.

### "our flight was cancelled"
Not Verified |  First and last experience flying Norwegian. We were scheduled to fly out of Newark at 23:59. At 18:48 PM we received a message saying that our flight was delayed until 5:15am. My sister called Norwegian and was on hold for 85 minutes to be told that the flight would definitely go and we should go in person to see an agent about vouchers. at 20:40, we were told that our flight was cancelled. we were provided no rebooking options and were told we could rebook online or cancel for refund. When you go online, however, Norwegian wanted to charge an additional 750$ to rebook on a different flight. All flights for 2 days were sold out. We were able to get on a $1000 one way ticket on another airline, the cheapest available, to get us in a day later and miss our non-refundable apartment booking. Meanwhile, my sister went to the airport to see about refunds and rebooking and was told that the in-person associates at the airport are a third party (Menzies Aviation) that does not have rights to rebook any clients, only to assist with hotel accommodations for delayed or cancelled flights. Other calls to customer service simply stated "We have a high call volume" and then hung up on us repeatedly.

### "flight attendants have always been friendly"
This is my eighth time flying with Norwegian. Pros: excellent value, clean, modern aircraft, the flight attendants have always been friendly to me, and are usually English-speaking, but not always, the agents at the gate have always been friendly and helpful to me, relative absence of annoying announcements, which I loathe, I have always found the toilets to be clean. Cons: the airline no longer provides access to the travel lounge for Premium passengers in L.A., the seats can be cold, although I did not experience that on this flight, the meals in Premium are so-so and do not compare with meals I have had while flying business class on other airlines.

### "refusing any compensation"
I was turned away at Dublin check in desk when trying to fly to New York. The girl checking me in, when asked what is the problem said "it could be any little thing. Maybe it's your middle name is not on the ESTA but is on your passport". I pointed out that none of the group (6) I was flying with had their middle names on their ESTA but were on their passports. I followed this up with Irish Passport control; Irish Immigration and USA Immigration. All verified that My ESTA application authorisation was valid and there was no reason I couldn't fly to the USA. Norwegian refused to offer me another flight or any form of compensation. 5 days later I flew out of Dublin to New York with United Airlines with the same documentation and had no issues at check in; Irish airport security; US security or US Customs and Border Protection. I informed Norwegian of all this information and they are refusing any compensation. I was out £500 for my flights with Norwegian; another £1000 for my flights with United Airlines and I missed out on 5 days of my holiday.

### "Have to research luggage info"
New York to Amsterdam. Have to research luggage info. You're allowed 22 pounds for your carry on and personal Item. I have never had as many restrictions on my carry on. There are limits for size, why should there be weight limits. The bags size should be smaller for that weight limit. The fees are confusing, being in British pound currency and direct flight states 1 price but then mine has a different price. Horrible transparency of luggage fees.

### "backpack and bag weighed 11 kg"
Madrid to New York. I had a horrible experience with Norwegian. I had a backpack and bag with souvenirs which weighed 11 kg and had to pay 80 euros because the amount allowed is 10kg. My backpack alone was 8.5 kg. They held my boarding pass until I paid, they even weighed my pillow. Never again, absolutely ridiculous and appalling.

### "Great plane and prices"
Orlando to Paris. I've flown Norwegian to Europe 3 times now. Great plane and prices. But this last trip from Orlando. to Paris was 4 hours late. The check in agent at the counter told us to board at 7:30 when they knew it was late. After being 4 hours late the lady at the gate said don't stand in here boarding lane when people are just tired and frustrated and ready to go. No email saying sorry but plenty of attitude.

### "Service was fine"
Rome to New York via Stockholm. Checkin at FCO was confusing. The line snaked to the foot traffic area of the airport. As the line moved near the check-in counters, there was signage saying "US-bound passengers" with arrow sign pointed to empty check-in counters. As I don't see the US-bound counters were not opened. I asked a Norwegian staff, my final destination is JFK and shall I line up here? She pointed to her back and go to the next check-in aisle behind her. I went there. It was the United Airlines check-in area. I came back and asked another Norwegian check-in staff. He pointed to the same line as I was transiting at ARN, not a direct flight to the US. FCO-ARN leg was chartered by Avion Express perhaps the grounding B737Max fleet. Avion used A320 and the condition of the plane was quite clean and well-kept even there were signs of some ageing. The plane did not have any branding painted on the body. It was all white. Seat pitch was adequate. At ARN, passengers were deplaned from both front and back exits. Front exit, passengers deplaned via jetbridge and at the back, through stairs and climbed back to the jetbridge. It was a quick way to deplane. ARN-JFK: Was seated on the last row. Service was fine. Pre-ordered food came out a bit longer than expected. Cabin crew talked and socialized quite loudly in the galley. Laughter and gossips could be heard through the in-flight headphone. The plane was clean and washroom was kept clean. Both legs were on time.

### "hard and uncomfortable seat"
❎ Not Verified | Gatwick to San Francisco. I am writing this review in the premium cabin on flight DI 7173. It is 10 hours into this flight. My butt hurts so much thanks to their hard and uncomfortable seat. If you wonder how it feels, close your toilet lid and sit on it. For the sake of your butt I would recommend bring something soft to put under it. If you fly premium, the ground would be smooth as you can check luggage at the counter. The experience may suck if you fly economy because bag drop and counter are separate. They must have learned it from the world's worst airline United. However, their wifi is very good and stable, even above the ocean. I have been using it for consecutive 10 hours and it never gave a hard time. Kudos to their IT team.

### "my luggage didn’t arrive"
Left New York JFK on July 16, the flight was scheduled at 12:30 AM, arrived to the airport at 8 pm on July 15, it took 4 hours to check in and go through the security, no priority checking. The flight attendant was very unfriendly and rude. Unfortunately my luggage didn’t arrive and is still in New York, hopefully will arrive on July 18, have to buy new clothes, shoes etc.Called the customer service ,but didn’t get any information why the luggage didn’t arrive the same day. Was told that i’ll be reimbursed for all my needs with 14 euro!

### "Weight check of hand baggage"
Oslo to Rome. Weight check of hand baggage at the gate during boarding. The ratio cost/service for Norwegian flights is decreasing for me! I feel disappointed and dissatisfied.

### "we would not have gotten on our flight"
Not Verified |  New York JFK to Copenhagen. Norwegian has a policy that if you do not check in to your flight 1 hour before scheduled departure, you will not get your boarding pass. We had a short layover in JFK (from a different airline, so they were not willing to work with us). When we got to JFK we ran to the Norwegian check in desk and got there 1 hour and 2 minutes before the scheduled departure. The extra 2 minutes were consumed with how long it took to weigh our carry-on luggage, and they would not print our boarding passes. Then one of the employees petitioned to his boss to print our boarding passes, which she finally consented. If it weren't for this staff member (who we hadn't met until 2 minutes before) we would not have gotten on our flight.

### "start to finish was exceptional"
❎ Not Verified | Oakland to Paris. My Norwegian customer service experience from check in to my return was 5 stars with the exception of the flight going to Paris. An outstanding customer service agent in Oakland was beyond exceptional. The planes were new and very comfortable and exceeded my expectations. We flew premium economy. My toddler son and I were in a deep sleep and the flight attendant woke us up when our meal came. We were also told we could use our travel cot at check-in and the flight attendant let us know we could not. My toddler son got sick needing to sleep. We then asked for additional water for the extenuating circumstance and I had to throw a small fit for someone to show some compassion and give me a small cup of water for his bottle. On our return flight, the customer service from start to finish was exceptional, attentive and the plane was new and very clean. We would fly Norwegian again

### "extraordinarily rude"
❎ Not Verified | Denver to London. The plane did not board until the time that we were actually supposed to take off. Delays happen but the plane was at the gate and they just did not have anyone board. Once we finally got onto the plane, we realized how uncomfortable the seats actually were. There was no cushion for your back, it felt like sitting against a metal or wooden table. Our flight was also 9 hours so I’m sure anyone could imagine how excruciating and irritating that was. Our meals were completely inedible, we are vegan and the vegetables and rice they provided us with were just awful. I would certainly not want to even try eating meat that they could have served. Their staff is extraordinarily rude and not accommodating. Bring your own pillows folks because they could not give a care in the world if you’re uncomfortable or unhappy with the service.

### "no meals or drinks are included"
Stockholm to Ft. Lauderdale. I found out that no meals or drinks are included in the price of the ticket. I was not even able to get a free water, the flight crew told me they don’t offer “that service” and I was referred to the snack bar. Tried to order sandwiches from the snack bar but other than chips and cookies nothing was available. Seats were very small, by far the least legroom I had.

### "reasonable price food"
Gatwick to Malaga. On way out, the younger male cabin crew were rude however on return the older male crew was excellent. Good flight, reasonable price food and drink and of course WiFi is good to have

### "The best budget airline in Europe"
Not Verified |  The best budget airline in Europe. Enjoyed the flight with Norwegian, really easy. Was delayed in Landvetter due to delay on the previous flight but airline did apologize about this and did their best to make up time. Was able to book an emergency exit row seat window for the discount price £10 (usually £17), seat was great able to spread out and very comfy. Toilet was clean just a bit small which can be attributed to the aircraft type. On landing at Gatwick we arrived at the gate and the pilot slammed the brakes hard to stop, the only disappointing thing about the flight we all jolted forward. Disembarking was quick and the flight was otherwise pretty good. Would recommend Norwegian.

### "departure delayed by 90 minutes"
Newark to Rome. We arrived at Newark airport before 9PM for an 11:30PM flight on Sat 6/22. We joined the Norwegian check-in line that was 500-person long and continued to grow longer over the next 2 hours. There were 5 ladies doing their best to check passengers in. My biggest complaint is with the manager who made no announcements in the 2.5 hours as we stood in the snaking line. At one point passengers headed to Barcelona (departing at 11PM) were separated into another line which further slowed the check-in process. Bottom-line, the flight departure was delayed by 90 minutes so all passengers could be checked in and security cleared. On board, the pilot made an apology about some luggage system not working and causing issues with check-in. A lot of aggravation could have been avoided if there had been a little communication and line management.

### "end of day 3 I receive my bag"
Chicago to Gatwick. We arrive to the airport for our  flight 3 hours before departure. On arrival to Gatwick airport everyones luggage arrives except for mine. It is so disheartening to not see your bag come off the conveyor. Especially on a Europe family holiday. Since we were hitting the ground running with booked events I could not focus on getting what I 'needed' until after 6 that night. Day 2 arrives and still no word on my bag for my direct flight. I received notice by the end of the day that they found it. Finally end of day 3 I receive my bag for my direct flight. Staff standing in the middle of the plane by the exit row as it has more space and carrying on incredibly loud social conversations almost the whole flight. I have never seen this level of unprofessionalism or disregard for passengers on any other airline in my life.

### "Flight delayed 2 hrs"
San Francisco to Gatwick. Flew Norwegian for the first time and a terrible experience. Flight delayed 2 hrs without prior info. Missed a subsequent flight due to this. One staff member was rude enough to suggest that I should plan my travels to accommodate possible delays. Baggage delivery took around 25 mins at Gatwick, which made sure that I missed my connecting flight even though I that flight was departing a good 3hrs after the Norwegian flight was supposed to land. During the flight I was told I would have to pay for extra water, despite the fact I had bought their top economy package which included free meal.

### "best airline I have ever flown"
London to Copenhagen. This is the best airline I have ever flown. Amazing staff, extremely helpful and attentive. This airline is in a different league to every other low cost airline in Europe which tries to desperately see where they can charge you extra money. Wonderful experience and will definitely fly again

### "airline exceeded my expectations"
Los Angeles to Barcelona. I was a little worried flying Norwegian because of all bad reviews, but I am glad I did. The self check in was easy, the line to drop off the luggage was huge and I was a little worried, but it went very fast. We had to pay for drinks, but I knew that and we brought our food, since I wasn't paying $45 for the meal. Each seat had it's own screen and entertainment was FREE: movies, shows, games. They also had screen with the flight progression, which was very helpful on 11 hours flight. All employees, at the airport and in the cabin were very helpful. Our flight was on time. Overall, the airline exceeded my expectations.

### "subcontracting  flight to Wamos"
I booked a flight in their Premium cabin to Gatwick. A few months later I heard they would be subcontracting the flight to Wamos. The 787 replaced with an aging and stained relic from the 1990's. Norwegian refused to move me to another airline. Six days before the flight, I was texted by the airline to say they had downgraded me to economy. It said I could call a customer service number in Europe to be switched to another flight, and that I would get my fare adjusted to the economy level. Waiting on long holds paying international rates is annoying enough, but then I was told that they would not move me to any of their other flights (in premium or economy). The next availability they had was two months later. The promised fare adjustment they also have a scam for. They take your money by credit card, but claim they can't refund to it. Instead they insist on a wire transfer to a bank account. You have to provide a range of  information on their website. There isn't a form for it - you just paste it into the general message box then wait and hope someone will check it in a few days. My bank charges to receive wire transfers, so I will actually end up paying even more money for the refund. There is no customer service option on their US telephone number. If you wait the 40 minutes to speak to a booking agent, they will not be able to help with anything. The online chat feature (if you can find it) is the same. I was lied to that the recent Boeing 737 problems were to blame for their Wamos decision - despite 737s not having the range to fly the Denver to London route

### "not the first time this has happened"
Not Verified |  I booked with Norwegian but I was on an extremely old aircraft flying back to the US and staffed by a non-Norwegian crew. This was not made clear when I was booking the ticket and in complete contrast with my flight into Gatwick from JFK, for which the plane and crew were excellent. We got into the plane and for the first 30 mins, there was no air conditioning. You just sat there and sweated. This is not the first time this has happened with Norwegian. I had the exact same experience last year (book with Norwegian and get a completely different aircraft and crew from Norwegian).

### "would never recommend them"
Not Verified |  We had the  worst experience on this flight from Madrid to Boston. They made us pay 80€ each to check bags that were over their extremely low limit. You can't check in online so you need to wait in a long line to check in. As of this was not enough when we were boarding I took a video of myself walking through the gate (with no one else in it) and got yelled at by multiple employees demanding to see it and have me delete it. I would never recommend them.

### "never had a worse flight "
Stockholm to Oslo. Amazing how 4 out of 4 of my recent trips with Norwegian has been delayed. I have never had a worse flight experience in my whole life. It's a one hour flight from Stockholm to Oslo and still, it gets delayed. And how can you not compensate for not keeping your schedules? Not a coffee, nothing. So when I rate this company it's gonna get nothing. 0 out of ten. IF u could rate with a negative nummer I really would. How can people still recommend this airline, I really don’t know.

### "Completely unacceptable"
Not Verified |  London Gatwick to Denver. Beyond awful customer service here at London Gatwick airport. The agents awful. They saw me running to my gate sweating disheveled I showed in my ticket and I had one carry-on luggage and it was over 1 pound and they charged me $100 at the gate. Completely unacceptable. He was awful the way he spoke to me, it was appalling I’ve been traveling now for 30 years and Norwegian is by far the worst airline.

### "they should be fine"
Not Verified |  Rome to Newark. This is a low cost airline. The plane was a Boeing 787 so it was comfortable but meals are not included in the lowest cost option, and aren't good if you buy one. They offered drinks twice (after an hour + on the plane, and then an hour left in the 7 hour flight). If you wanted drinks between those points I think you had to pay for them (which you can do from your in seat entertainment console). The entertainment options are much more limited than on other airlines I've flown. All in all they got us where we were going and on time. So if they are cheaper by a lot than other options just be prepared with an iPad with movies, some food and drinks for the plane, and they should be fine.

### "an excellent experience"
Not Verified |  This was an excellent experience on Premium Economy. Naturally the half empty cabin helps, but all in all, I can safely say that Norwegian’s premium product is far better than BA, AF, and Cathay. And it is still better than an equally empty cabin on AA. Service is limited, but for a day flight, we got two very good meals. The vegetarian option was equally good. Two things make the product better than the much more expensive rivals: Seat comfort: leg space and overall comfort is almost like an old business class seat. And the 2-3-2 configuration makes it less crowded than the 2-4-2 of others. Cabin configuration: besides the seat arrangement, the key thing is that the premium cabin is large, and, in the absence of a business class, it is up front. So you get 10 rows isolated from the rest of the plane, with 2 reserved toilets. On most other airlines the “premium” cabin is 4 rows of seats sandwiched between business and economy. It is actually economy with a better seat. Free-WiFi is a plus, although a very slow plus. The only downside for such a long flight is the entertainment system. Choices are limited, but to be fair, still better than BA. I have flown on 787s before, but this is the first time that I enjoyed. The plane is well suited for a day flight. The cleaner and more humid air helps, and the automatic shades keeps the cabin “open” to the skies without the glaring sunshine. Looking forward to the next opportunity to fly with them. The price/quality ratio is unbeatable.

### "would miss our connecting flight"
Copenhagen to Los Angeles. Our flight was delayed for nearly 4 hours which meant we would miss our connecting flight. When I asked the ticket agent about this I was told I had to call customer service. I called customer service and was informed I could be rescheduled for an even later flight or have my reservation cancelled completely. I explained that we were going to miss our connecting flight and be stranded at the airport overnight. I was told it was not their policy not to help customers in such an event. A little help trying to find lodging or even an apology would have been nice.

### "never depart without delay"
Copenhagen to Budapest, delayed by 45 mins I fly with Norwegian around 6-7 times a year, and never depart without delay. It is becoming a little bit irritating. I always thought of them as a better option over Ryanair, but I am not sure anymore.

### "failed their own printed policies"
Nice to JFK through Copenhagen. Arriving in Copenhagen, I saw the flight to JFK scheduled for 17.45 was delayed. I sought a Norwegian agent. She was unable to provide any information regarding the reason for the delay, the possibility of more delay, the possibility of cancellation. At 23.30, they boarded us on the plane. The captain announced that the plane had been in maintenance. We taxied away from the gate and 5 minutes later went back, announcing there was a problem with the engine. We remained on the aircraft with no communication or aid from the crew. They did not pass out water or make an effort to continuously keep us informed. At 3:30am the captain announced the flight was cancelled, we would be exiting the plane and there would be staff available to aid us with next steps. We exited the plane but there was not a single representative of the airline present. They abandoned 400 people in a closed airport at 4am with no access to food or water, staff, no one from the airport staff present,  and no information as to whether we would even have access to our luggage. Norwegian failed their own printed policies.

### "backpack had to be included"
New York to Paris flight one hour delayed, a complete mess at the JFK airport check-in, I have never seen In my life a check-in line so long. Finally lucky enough to make it to the counter. I didn't realize that my backpack had to be included in the cabin weight allowance, I had a small bag and a cabin suitcase, going over by 5kg. The staff would not budge and charged me $100.

### "I was not allowed to get on"
They require you to check in at the counter a few hours before departure, so standing in line to get my ticket wasted 30 minutes. By the time I made it through Orlando security, the airplane door was already shut and I was not allowed to get on. The attendants at the desk were sweet and told me to call customer service. Customer service was rude to me and erroneously told me there was nothing I could do because I had never checked in, when clearly I had my ticket in my hand. I even tried to speak to a supervisor but they were working at the gates. I was given an office number and I left multiple voicemails and phone calls. My request for Norwegian to give me back my taxes has gone unanswered.

### "was a replacement aircraft"
Miami to Gatwick. This was a replacement aircraft in place of the Boeing 787 usually used by Norwegian. The complete experience was a nightmare from beginning to end. The seats were broken and uncomfortable, they had old entertainment with 3 channels which did not work well. The headphone jack did not fit modern headsets. The cabin service left a lot to be desired. It seems that Norwegian also outsource their crew to Privilege Style. It’s a shame that Norwegian continue to send me emails that offer me more than a 100 channels of entertainment on my trip. It’s false advertising and very irritating.

### "Price for ticket was good"
I Flew from Los Angeles to Madrid Spain. Price for the ticket was good. But after taking the flight, I did not know I would not be offered a single cup of water for free.

### "got changed another flight"
Barcelona to Stockholm. Had booked a flight to Stockholm which should arrived at 7AM and got changed my flight 3 weeks prior departure, flight was changed with arrival time 930 PM, which changed  my trip plans and made me lost a whole day. Flight was OK, Now, 2 weeks after my flight I also got changed another flight to Stavanger, which had to arrive at 11 AM and was changed at 1850 PM arrival time. Totally unacceptable, I chose both flights because of arrival time. Also, I paid for chosing seat for a direct flight, since I changed to a flight with stopover I have to pay to choose seat in the second flight.

### "check in closure an hour before"
Providence to Dublin. 6 hour flight and no free no food. Ridiculous check in closure an hour before flight. As a low-cost airline you pay for everything even down to a blanket. Clearly shows no interest in passenger care.

### "couldn’t rebook for 4 days"
London to Boston. Terrible, when something goes wrong the lack of a large fleet is obvious - couldn’t rebook my flight for 4 days after we were due to go. Seats uncomfy and food expensive and terrible. Old entertainment

### "not aware no meal included"
Gatwick to Miami. Online check-in wasn’t available. I was not aware there was no meal included on my 9 hour flight. Checked baggage is quite expensive, so it’s worth taking that into account when you book - another airline might be cheaper once you’ve added that and meal costs in. On the flight, I had to pay for headphones as the ones I had weren’t compatible. The entertainment system had a very small selection of films and tv shows. The one redeeming grace was being able to order food and drinks from your seat. However, on the return flight the entertainment system was broken, so there wasn’t a thing to watch/listen and you couldn’t order drinks/food. I waited and waited to order a drink and was told I wouldn’t be served until all of the pre-paying customers had received a meal and drink (over an hour after getting on the plane). The guy sitting next to me started to get quite verbally aggressive about the fact they wouldn’t even give him water. I know the airline isn’t responsible for customers’ behaviour but his frustration could have been avoided if they would have just given him a glass of tap water. His endless venting made my experience even more unpleasant.

### "bag to be placed below seat"
Gatwick to Copenhagen. Ground service was slow and rude. First impression of the cabin crew was bad. Was putting my laptop bag on the overhead compartment and cabin crew demanding passenger with small bag to be placed below the seat. It happened twice, once to me and another time to another passenger.

### "made it 45 minutes before departure"
In our instance, it was not all the airlines fault, but it was a very frustrating experience. We were coming from Mexico, and got stuck in an absurd customs line. We were prepared for an hour, it took almost 2 hours. I had booked the flights separetly. I did not know that the check in desk closes an hour before departure. We made it 45 minutes before departure but couldn't check in. The agent only told us to call a 1 800 number, and I waited on the phone for 52 minutes before someone answered. This person told me I could have cancelled my the flight a half hour before departure time, but that time had passed by the time they answered the phone. We had to buy a new ticket which was not cheap since it was for the next day. I hadn't intended to buy the flights on the same day, and when I realised my error, decided to risk it. Bad decision. For anyone flying Norwegian, I'd recommend that you read all of the info on their website. I didn't, and it cost us a pretty penny. In hindsite, I would have tried changing or cancelling online instead of calling - the person on the phone was not there to help me figure out a good solution, she just stated the rules you find online, and I was out of luck.

### " you get what you pay for"
Paris to Oakland. Norwegian Air has a cheap ticket price, but you pay for food, select seat, checked baggage, ear phones, pillow, blanket. The in flight 7.00 usd sandwich I bought was a piece of flatbread with sauce and cheese served in a plastic wrapper. My pre-ordered meal was overpriced and small too. The USB port did not charge my phone. I found entertainment selections on a 10 hour flight were very limited, and no music available. I would say you get what you pay for, and you get the bare minimum in service, food, and other services.

### "knew I had excess baggage"
Fort Lauderdale to Gatwick. I knew I had excess baggage and before flying, and prior to travelling I was quoted costs £9 per kilo, and charged $15 at check-in, even though the agent knew the embarkation airport. The check-in agent charged each bag separately, even though each bag was within their limits. A nearby agent advised her of the cheaper method but she refused the advice. In addition, they charged for a computer bag, and then charged hand luggage as hold luggage, as they said it was too large and overweight. In total, we were charged $560 for excess luggage! I complained at check-in, and again to customers services in writing but to no avail.

### "a very nice flight"
Travelled from Gatwick to Tampa. It was a very nice flight. Was able to visit my lounge and show Norwegian Air boarding pass for discount. Will fly them again.

### "Norwegian is a great option"
Norwegian was great. Even though I live in Buffalo, it was worth the drive to Boston for a round-trip direct flight to Rome. It's a low-cost airline, so you don't expect perks but the entertainment system was high-quality and the seats were comfortable and had enough legroom even for a 6'4" guy like myself. As long as you're aware of what is and isn't included in your extremely low ticket price, Norwegian is a great option for trans-Atlantic flights.

### "wouldn't fly again with them"
To do the check in, I had to wait 24 hours before. The staff from Gatwick to Helsinki on 7th May were not really helpful at all. I asked for some water to take a pill and they don't have free water on board. They give you the option of watching their movies on board, paying £5 for 24h. My flight from Helsinki to Gatwick was delayed 2 hours. I wouldn't fly again with them.

### "happy with our flight"
Not Verified | Dublin to Hamilton. We were very happy with our flight, the pricing was excellent, and we were treated well. Unfortunately we arrived late due to very strong head winds. They had to add additional fuel before take off, and we had to land in Goose Bay to refuel again. We were scheduled on a 373 Max which was grounded a few weeks before our departure, Norwegian did not cancel our flight, but instead used a less efficient aircraft that I am sure must have cost far to fly than the 737 Max. Therefore, we were upset when several web sites emailed us and asked us to apply for compensation because the flight was late. (That's like kicking some one is down) Thanks Norwegian.

### "No onboard vegan food"
Bordeaux to Helsinki via Oslo. We did not get any notification asking us to check in online the day before departure. When trying to check in online by ourselves from the airline website, the form did not recognize our registration numbers. 2 hours before departure we finally received SMS with hyperlinks supposedly containing our tickets. At the airport no self-service check-in was available  so we queued at the check-in counter like everybody else. Check-in staff insisted to register our cabin luggage as checked luggage  to discover upon arrival that our luggage got lost. No onboard vegan food options - no onboard wifi, no free water, We received a property irregularity report with a file reference and were told that our lost luggage would come with the next flight, but we did not get contacted by anybody more than one day later. Very poor experience with the website provided to track the status of the luggage.

### "never had a problem"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Los Angeles. I have done 3 long hauls with them and have never had a problem. They leave on time for me. Seats have a little less space than usual. Entertainment isn’t as amazing as it would be on the leading airlines, however, there are a couple of good films on there and I have my iPad to entertain me. The food for me is ok, I am a vegan and this is the only airline where I don’t need to check the ingredients of the food which is given to me. Over all a fine experience and will be flying with them again in the future

### "unprofessional teasing of a customer"
San Francisco to London via Amsterdam with Norwegian. Normal sized hand baggage only allowed 10 kg. Check is charged at $100. As a frequent traveler I have never paid that amount. Secondly: 2 persons, 2 handbags, had to transfer 3 kg from one to another bag before ticket was printed. Very unprofessional teasing of a customer.

### "someone else took my luggage "
Dubrovnic to Copenhagen. I was forced to checked in my luggage at Dubrovnik because I was told the flight was full. Uupon arrival, I found out that someone else took my luggage by mistake. My Keys were actually in my bag because I didn't expect to check in it and forgot to take it out. It turned out to be a nightmare for me and I had to rent a hotel for one night and call for a door opener the following day. Usually the airline should compensate my loss due to luggage latency but they refused to do so and the service was very bad!

### "was great to fly with"
Norwegian was great to fly with. The Boeing 787 seats were very comfortable. The staff were friendly. My flights were all on time and check in was a breeze. The best part is that it was a direct flight from London to USA and return and extremely reasonably priced.

### "Meals have to be pre-ordered"
Copenhagen to Orlando with Norwegian. This was the worst flight I've taken in thirty years. The staff seemed robotic as if pre-programmed - efficiency at any cost, as a result they were impersonal and rude to me. Meals have to be pre-ordered on this airline but I was not aware of that, even though I bought my ticket several months in advance.

### "missed our Spirit Airlines flight"
Paris to Ft. Lauderdale on Norwegian. Flight DY 3077 was delayed an hour and further delayed another half hour when they had a passenger arrested by local police and TSA at Ft Lauderdale. Because of the delay, we missed our Spirit Airlines connecting flight to Dallas less than 2 hours later. When I spoke with customer service at Norwegian in Ft Lauderdale, they mentioned “their only responsibility was to get us back to the US.” I called the corporate number, and a representative actually confirmed this. She said that if they are not more than 5 hours late the only compensation they provide are meal vouchers. Spirit, with whom we had our connecting flight with, didn’t have an available opening on a plane for four days!

### "experience was very good"
Not Verified |  I've just flown from  Gatwick to New York return flight, my experience was very good, very good punctuality, excellent service, friendly staff and the food was good quality for “plane food”. I was lucky on the way back as I got the “golden seat” the one near the exit door which means you are totally free to get up without disturbing anyone, so that was great , I would happily recommend Norwegian to my friends and family.

### "get less than you pay for"
Rome to New York. Norwegian advertises use of Boeing Dreamliners but every flight I have had has been farmed out to Privilege Style Airlines that uses old decommissioned equipment from major carriers such a Singapore Airlines. When I boarded I was reassigned to a seat because the originally assigned business class seat was unusable. As it turned out the one I was assigned was unusable also. The only function it afforded was allowing one to sit upright. Nothing else was offered since all other seats were taken. I was essentially ignored over the entire flight and had to endure nearly eight hours of unrelieved discomfort and stress. To boot, I was not the only passenger so inconvenienced. When I requested a complaint form I was told the complaint had to be made to Norwegian and not Privilege Style. When I complained to Norwegian and asked for some restitution all that was offered was flight miles that wouldn't come close to even providing a one way coach trip and then with an airline I would never consider using again. Anyone flying with Norwegian should recognize they are very likely to be mislead (there is a more potent word that is a more apt but probably not allowed), ignored, dealt with unfairly and with no expectation of customer service. With Norwegian you can expect to get less than you pay for. If the attitude toward their patrons and interior equipment is any guide, one flies Norwegian at great risk. They should not be in business. Do not fly with this airline. It is cheap (in every sense of the word), but if you think you are getting a bargain, you aren't and must be prepared to regret your decision. Norwegian's prices are tempting, indeed, but not worth the risk.

### "informed that I was on standby"
Purchased a one-way Norwegian ticket from New York JFK to London Gatwick to catch a connecting flight to Geneva. Arrived at JFK at 8pm on 20 April (over 3 hours before the flight) to chaos at the  checkin - machines didn’t work (nor did advanced check in) and thousands waiting in unmoving queues. When I finally reached the desk I was informed by a rude staff member that I was on standby - she admitted they had oversold the flight. In the end, the best she could offer me was waiting 2 days for another London flight (the next day was fully booked) or flying to Amsterdam later that night -  with no chance of catching my connecting flight in London and having to purchase a new and very expensive ticket myself (Norwegian  refused, even though it was clearly their fault) to finally get me to Geneva. I’m writing this from Schiphol Amsterdam during a ten hour lay over! If this is where deregulated air travel has taken us - when airlines can  refuse to honour tickets they’ve sold and leave the traveller high and dry for days - without an apology, let alone attempts to help - then something has gone terribly wrong. Norweigan has achieved a new low for me - and I’m sure I’m not alone.

### "his personal item was over"
I recently flew Boston to Gatwick with my 2 kids. We paid close to $600 per ticket, which I know they consider low cost, but which I don't consider cheap. If you buy the LowFare tickets, they seem determined to make you as miserable as possible, and charge you enough extra fees that it would have been the same price to fly on a better airline. Unless you pay for the upgrades they offer you, you may be seated in the worst seats on the plane, possibly separated from your party. I did not expect to be charged an extra 70 pounds for luggage on the way back. We flew to London without incident. Then, we tried to check in at the kiosk and for some reason, it would only check in myself and my daughter and not my son. We had to wait in the long line. We were given no explanation for this, but when they weighed his carry on together with his personal item it was over. I was unhappy about this, since this had not been an issue on the flight over, but I agreed to pay. I waited there with my credit card out, and finally another woman came over who I guess was the manager. She said that I shouldn't have told her that we were not charged on the way over because now she was going to charge me for that fare too. I did not feel like I was in a position to argue, since I did not want to be denied boarding, so I got stuck paying. I have never experienced this poor level of service. Never again.

### "delayed 4 hrs"
Not Verified | First flight was delayed 4 hrs - now on way from Paris back to Oakland delayed because route needs to changed. Waited on the ground now passenger is sick and we are delayed another 2 hrs. Never will we fly with them again.

### "hand luggage over 10 kg"
Oslo to Gatwick. What a terrible airline - avoid at all costs. The staff on the ground are sullen and unhelpful. They made us check in 2 bags at boarding, because the combined hand luggage weight for two people in our party was over 10 kg. They charged us 150NOK, there were 5 of us in total and we could have redistributed the weight amongst us and none of our baggage was oversized.

### "amazed with the great service"
Bangkok to Oslo. Amazing airline with great staff and very good services. From the check in until arrival we were treated in a very good manner by airport staff and also by cabin crew, smiling and full of enthusiasm. New and clean aircraft with comfortable seats and nice inflight entertaiment. Some people were upset because of the luggage but company informed even via sms and email about policy. Well done Norwegian! Really amazed with the great service for a low cost airline!

### "handbag is too big"
Oslo to Tel Aviv. Flight was delayed as 20 minutes before flight time they ran a handbag size check. They said it is too big and charged 750kr although my ticket included an option for a checked-in bag. I never encountered such rude behaviour.

### "my carryons were overweight"
San Francisco to Barcelona via Gatwick. Charged $200 because the combined (not individual) weight of my carryons were overweight ($100 for the first leg, and then another $100 since I had a layover), plus the person checking my bag accidentally also charged my credit card $800, which I have to now wait until it clears off of my card.

### "had to pay $90 for 3kg"
Las Vegas to Gatwick. After purchasing my tickets to Gatwick for my daughter’s college graduation, I received an e-mail from Norwegian Airlines to place a bid to be upgraded to Premium seating. As this is almost a ten hour flight, I thought why not?! The bidding was confusing. I thought I was bidding $50, but actually they added $50 to the original cost of my ticket and added that sum to my original ticket. This made my ticket for one-way over $750. It stated on my bid that I had up to 36 hours from the departure of my flight to opt out for this. Well, it was over 48 hours until departure, so I felt I was in the clear! The first person I spoke to on the phone continues to put me on hold as he pretended to speak to his supervisor. Not understanding what the complication was, I was becoming frustrated. I had my itinerary, I wanted my original seat of 14J. After spending a substantial amount of time on the phone with him, he kept telling me this wasn’t easy to do. Then, he hung up. I had to call back and start all over again. He finally said he would give me my original seat and would send me updated documentation. Which he never did. When I went to the airport, the ticket agent gave me my boarding pass of 14J, with no reference to Premium seats. On the flight back, I was confronted by a gate agent who looked at my ticket. Seeing it was a bargain fare, she asked me to weigh my carry-on luggage. She said it was 3kg over. I was forced to take breakable out of my bag. I had to pay $90 for 3kg. When I arrived home, they processed the extra $395 for a seat and service I never received. I disputed the charge with my credit card company only to be told by Norwegian that the fee was justified.

### "They allow 10 kg of carry on"
They allow 10 kg of carry on baggage allowance, I was 4 kg over and I had to pay $75 extra. They have people at the check in to check sure you don’t go over 10 kg. They don’t let you check in online and if you want to check in at the kiosk there’s staff that will weigh your stuff... this causes huge lines. They don’t give you free food on an 8hr flight? I won’t be getting this airline again

### "Very good service"
Not Verified |  Tenerife to Malaga. Very good service and no problem at all. I really like flying Norwegian! Ground Staff was really friendly as well as cabin crews and pilots. Smooth flight and nice service.

### "Norwegian carry-on size rule"
Traveling from Oslo to JFK on flight 7001, March 2019. After checking in and waiting for a flight that was more than 3 hours delayed we were stopped right before boarding, and the sizes of our carry-ons, which were checked and approved at the check-in counter, were again measured against the Norwegian carry-on size rule. My bag was 2 mm over the line and I was told I must pay 650 kroner (~$76) and must hand my carry-on over to be checked in as regular baggage. The people who had fragile items or medicines etc. that they needed from their carry-ons had no time to re-pack. If we had been told during check-in it would have been manageable and people could have repacked, but to be approved already and then have that approval revoked at the last minute and the bag taken away. It was an inhumane money-making operation.

### "Very pleasant experience"
Amsterdam to New York. Very pleasant experience. Thanks to Gardishja from the ground crew at Amsterdam Schiphol. Her help was crucial an very appreciated. Fantastic flight and smooth landings

### "have new luggage rules"
Los Angeles to Oslo. The plane was 1 hour and 30 minutes delayed when we arrived to the airport. Oh well, that happens, no worries. We checked in and received our boarding passes, we also received yellow “approved” bands that the Norwegian helpdesk attaches to our small carry on’s letting us know we were approved to bring our carry on with us on board the plane. My grandmother just died in Norway and I made it clear that I had part of her ashes with me in my small carry on. That’s no problem Norwegian said. Of course you can bring it on, and now you have a yellow approved tag on as well! We proceed with security check in and head towards our gate. The plane is now even more delayed. About ten minutes before boarding the plane Norwegian starts bugging everyone about their luggage. Apparently they claim to have new luggage rules, so they are charging 750 NOK extra to take your carry on from you before boarding. The same small suitcase I just used as carry on with a Norwegian flight from LAX to Oslo 3 days ago, now was too big, and they said you have to pay now and give it to us - for the flight from Oslo to LAX. Everyone was so mad! Norwegian doesn’t inform anyone of this of course My grandmothers ashes that I already discussed and confirmed with Norwegian check in was taken from me. I was charged 1300 for my boyfriend and mine small carry ons. They were extremely unprofessional in handling this matter. They finally gave me my carry on back (but I was charged of course). I will never fly Norwegian again.

### "was easy and convenient"
Not Verified |  Trondheim to Athens via Oslo. Totally recommend you choose Norwegian. Everything was easy and convenient. Also the fact they provide FREE Wi-Fi on board makes the experience even better. Cabin crew was nice and helpful. Food is not included but you are flying for a low-cost carrier what'd you expect?

### "I won't hesitate to fly them again"
I had a great flight with Norwegian from Amsterdam to New York. The plane was very new with comfortable seats. I had a row of 3 seats for myself so I managed to get some sleep during the flight. The entertainment system works very well with lots of content and the screen quality was very good. I booked the plus package which included one piece of checked luggage and a meal on board. The meal was not so good and the buy on board products looked way better then the standard meal. You can buy products easily via the entertainment system and the crew will bring it to your seat. The crew on this flight was friendly and they even had some Dutch crew on board. I was a bit afraid of flying on a low cost carrier like Norwegian over the Atlantic on a long flight but their product is very good and I won't hesitate to fly them again.

### "refuse to refund two flights"
I booked tickets for my children to fly to Los Angeles. My son is 13 and my daughter is 11. I found out that I needed a chaperone for the flight due to my son not being old enough to chaperone my daughter. I contacted Norwegian to book a chaperone only to be informed that they do not offer unaccompanied minor service on that flight. Why would their system allow me to book tickets that I could not use? No one on the booking was over 16, and they ask for the ages of the children, so how can it be we were allowed to book tickets that we could not use? This caused us a massive amount of problems, stress and headaches. I contacted Norwegian and was told me that I would have to change the flights and pay $120 each ticket, each way to change them. This was not an option as the booking system should never have allowed us to book flights we could not use. Instead I contacted them again to request that they cancel and credit me for the outgoing flights as my sister in law flew out here and took the kids back to Los Angeles at great expense to her in time and money. She was literally at Heathrow for 3.5 hours. I then had to book a turnaround flight to LAX from Gatwick on Norwegian to pick up the children on the 24th. I had to coordinate my tickets to ensure that I got on the same flight back so I was in Los Angeles for 24 hours. I cannot explain how incredibly difficult this whole production became purely because their system allowed tickets to be booked that could not be used. We spent an incredible amount of time, stress, and money to rectify the failure in their booking system. My sister in law spent thousands of pounds worth of air miles and I spent 448.70 GBP buying a flight that I should not have to have purchased. All I originally requested was for a full refund for the two flights that we were unable to use, which were the two leaving from Gatwick on the 17th. I have booked around 23 separate flights on Norwegian since January of 2018. I think you could say that I am a good client and one that they probably don't want to lose as we fly regularly between US and UK. Alas, after contacting them numerous times, they refuse to refund two flights that we did not get to use let alone the cost of the BA flights and the round trip ticket I had to purchase, none of which I was requesting. I only wanted the tickets that we could not use.

### "bag was still too big"
Norwegian used to be a great airline. When I saw favorable prices to my destination I jumped at the opportunity to fly with time. First of all, their lines are very long. It’s been two hours since I got to the airport and all I’ve done is wait on line. As I was 10 minutes into waiting on the first line to check in, an employee demanded I wait on another line to get my carry on approved AWAY bag checked in. Ok, waited on that line to find out my bag was too large. Again, it meets their already ridiculous size requirements. I take out and wear as many clothes as I can so I can have my bag on me. I have a train to catch the hour after I land so I wasn’t planning on spending any time waiting for my bag. The bag was still too big. I didn’t want to waste any time. Then I wait on that line and am told a check in bag last minute is $100. I feel like my urgency and willingness to comply was exploited. I’m minutes away from boarding and waiting on the typical tsa check in line. Would have just checked in a bag from home if that were the case.

### "need to pay for food"
I will never take a long flight with Norwegian, good for short trips within Europe. Flown from Bangkok to Helsinki. As a low-cost airline, you need to pay for food, drinks, blankets and headsets. Due to a delay I missed my connection to Helsinki and little assistance was provided.

### "Definitely a good choice"
Amazing airline. I flew from Barcelona to Krabi in Thailand with a stop in Oslo. Nice comfortable seats with good entertainment system. Very kind and nice cabin crew and safety was not compromised on both flights. Very good choice of food and drinks, good wifi on route to Oslo. Definitely a good choice.

### "never booked with Norwegian before"
Los Angeles to Paris. I have never booked with Norwegian before. When I looked on google flights I was able to find round trip tickets out of LA for $491. Upon booking I noticed that they charge $50 to pick my own seats on each flight. I planned to carry on but I thought that maybe I might bring home some souvenirs so I paid another $50 to check a bag on my return flight only thinking I could handle the amount of luggage on my departing flight myself. I had a backpack and a small carry on suitcase. Upon check in I was told that I could not carry on more than ten pounds which my luggage exceeded. I was told that it would cost me not $100 but $200 because, even though I booked the reservation together and was not switching airlines, that because I had a connecting flight they had to charge me twice adding another $200 to my bill. On top of that I did NOT get the seat that I chose and paid for. I was handed a middle seat for my 11 hour flight. I bought three drinks and was ignored by staff. They were rude and wouldn't remove my trash when I asked politely. This was a truly terrible experience.

### "unable to pay for baggage"
Dublin to New York. Their app wouldn't let me check in and I was unable to pay for baggage. At airport they charged me €80 per bag when it was just over the 10kg. Not worth the low fare"as they nickle and dime you on everything. Just fly Aer Lingus and enjoy the space and free bags.

### "checking size of suitcases"
Oslo to New York JFK. Norwegian was fair. The seats were OK. The outgoing flight's take off by 4 hours. We opted to give up our non-stop flight to switch to another flight. A year earlier, out flight was also delayed out of NY, and eventually cancelled altogether, which caused cancellation of out entire trip. We couldn't be rebooked for 2 days. We traveled to Denmark then Oslo on our rebooked flight, missed our connection and were forced to book another flight to our destination of Tromso. The flight was fair, we carried on our luggage, and brought our own food. The return flight from Oslo to NY was OK. The big problem on this leg, was the carry on luggage. At the gate, the airline was checking the size of the suitcases with an undersized suitcase carrier and were charging people $80 to take the same suitcase that traveled in the overhead bin on the way to Norway. Upon entering the aircraft, I noticed no less than 5 completely empty overhead bins. There was plenty of room for my suitcase. The airline personnel  ignored customers who did not purchase meals or drinks on the plane. On both flights I was ignored.

### "the flight was closed"
Not Verified |  Krakow to New York JFK via Oslo. Was at check in 45 minutes before the flight and told by agent the flight was closed. Refused to give me boarding pass and told me to talk to her supervisor at another check in. Could not find her supervisor. Airline refused to help and would not rebook or refund me the cost of the flight.

### "could not fault this airline"
London Gatwick to Singapore with Norwegian. For the price we paid for such a long haul flight we could not fault this airline. Comfortable economy seats with good choice of inflight entertainment. Staff were friendly.

### "seats were so comfortable"
Not Verified |  New York to Amsterdam. I absolutely loved the Norwegian plane, the seats were so comfortable and the leg room was amazing! Very comfortable flight departing and returning. But the flight attendants were rude and non-professional.

### "good customer service and polite"
Madrid to Stockholm. Ground staff really friendly, very fast boarding and on time take off. The aircraft was very clean and nice. Onboard crew with good customer service and polite.

### "was a very comfortable flight"
Las Vegas to London. I was cautious about booking an almost 10 hour flight with Norwegian based on the numerous negative reviews on this forum. As it turns out they were amazing. Although no online checkin is available when departing Las Vegas, the process at the airport was extremely quick, professional and friendly. Boarding was handled very efficiently and we ended up leaving the gate 12 minutes early. On board, the crew were attentive and professional and very well groomed. Entertainment by way of free PTV was a welcome bonus and the moving map option a nice touch. I would have no hesitation flying thus airline again. I was in economy and it was a very comfortable flight.

### "left a very poor impression"
Rome to Newark. My boyfriend and I have been a frequent flyers of Norwegian, but this experience has caused us to avoid any future flights. The moment we handed over our boarding pass, the staff threatened to charge us a €160 check-in fee for our luggage. Without even giving us a fair chance to measure our luggage within the proper dimensions cage, they  rushed us to hand over a credit card. The staff even went as far as threatening us to pay the fee or leave our luggage behind. Out of fear of missing our flight, I handed over my credit card. However, after my boyfriend nearly forcing his way to a proper chance of putting our luggage in the measurement cage, we showed that our bags were within the proper dimensions and weight. Even after proving our compliance with bag rules, the staff member proceeded to make up other excuses to charge us (ie. You took out a coat, so it does not count"). When the staff realized she was in the wrong, she did not offer any apology nor compensation for this inconvenience and unprofessionalism. In fact, she initially refused to show my receipt for the cancelled transaction, and told us to "check our bags better next time" even though it showed we had done nothing wrong. We were the first in line to board to plane for our section, but because of all this, we ended being the very last. This left a very poor impression on your airline's customer service. We had have many positive flights from Norwegian Air and extremely disappointed on how this situation was handled.

### "Very disappointed"
Orlando to Gatwick on low fare ticket. Seats very cramped, no pillows, blankets etc. Everything designed for you to pay more, ie purchasing drinks and foods. We had purchased in flight meals, definitely not worth the money the morning offering of a cold hard roll. Staff just ok I'm afraid, one member of staff after having paid for drinks proceeded without speaking to plonk them down without a word. Very disappointed.

### "comfortable and sufficiently spacious"
Stockholm to Luleå. The airline arrived late but the crew were apologetic and hurried all passengers to hasten their speed of boarding to make up for lost time. The seat was comfortable and sufficiently spacious. Even comes with free wifi!

### "2kg carry-on weight extra"
Paris to Boston. They charged me $91 for 2 kg of carry-on weight extra. It took me 2 days on their website to book a ticket because the website doesn't take punctuation such as str. ave. etc. As a low-cost airline no free water was offered. I have been writing to Norwegian airlines for months and all I get is "this is our policy. We charge for every kg overweight, we charge for water, a blanket etc,

### "value for money below average"
Stockholm to Dubai return. Check in in ARN (Stockholm) pretty smooth. Food and snacks were available for purchase on board. No blanket or pillow provided. No in-flight entertainment (which we were aware of), but Wi-Fi on-board was not installed either (which we did not know of). It felt like the AC was not functioning properly as everyone in the cabin was sweating. Seats ok regarding this was economy class. On our return flight from Dubai, the aircraft was late which affected our boarding. The crew by the gate seemed to be confused, so first they call families and passengers needing assistance to come forward, only to wait for another half an hour. At the same time they called for "Zone A" passengers, not mentioning anything for passengers (like us) that had Priority boarding! In the end everyone just buzzed forward towards the gate with absolutely no order at all. The flight experience was worse this time as the cabin was freezing. No Wi-Fi on that flight, which this time was ok as this was a night flight so hopefully we would sleep through it. No blanket or pillow supplied free. I don't think we are going to be flying Norwegian again if other options are available. Specially not for longer flights. Our tickets were not that cheap and the value for money was below average.

### "the best budget airline"
Not Verified |  Malaga to Gatwick. First time we’d flown with Norwegian. By far the best budget airline. The staff were attentive and so friendly. The seats were comfortable with good leg room. Highly recommended, will definitely book with them again

### "Great flights. Highly recommended"
Vienna to Gatwick via Oslo. Great flights. I flew via Oslo just for fun. I was meant to have 2.5 hours in Oslo, but departure from Vienna was delayed becouse of the bags of No-show passengers having to be removed - not Norwegians fault. This delayed us about 45 minutes. Also, the flight time was also longer than scheduled because of winds up to 200KM/H. Again, this was not the fault of Norwegian. The only downside was that the new B737-MAX8 hadn't got WiFi installed yet. We arrived in Oslo, and they made everyone wait while us passengers with short connections where allowed off first. I had just over an hour, but I was looking forward to having a look, so I wondered outside into the lovely snowy Norwegian winter. After about 10 minutes, with about 55 minutes left till takeoff, I went back in, quickly cleared security, and got to my gate. Our second flight was about 30 minutes latte, but we made up most of the time en route to Gatwick. Reasonable food prices, good hand baggage allowance (2 bags). However, at Oslo, they took my hand luggage case, because the flight was full. Again, i totally understand this, had the whole row to myself on both flights, I got lucky. Great flights. Highly recommended.

### "they have the best value"
Helsinki to Prague. New Boeing 737-8Max. But again, as so many times before, they didn't have wifi onboard. Anyway, the flight was little bit delayed. I was travelling with 3 friends, and we didn't want to pay extra for anything, so we got Free normal size cabin bad of 10kg (yes, that's good). Seat was given at airport's check in machine. I got an aisle seat at front. My fried got the first row entirely so I moved there (extra leg space and this felt like in business class). Two other got some packed tiny seats somewhere. There was snacks and drinks to buy, so we bought Finnish long drinks. Not so expensive. Crew were smiling and professional. Overall, with this value (50eur) everything was ok. I like Norwegian as they have the best value and many discounts. Just get this wifi thing sorted and i can say i love you.

### "pay +$80 for our carry ons"
There were three in our party, each of us packed 26 kg, when we get to Vegas to check in, she said we were wrong and it’s 20 kg and that it’s $100 more. I raced to buy more luggage, finally got it evenly dispersed then when we checked in with another staff, it was $200 ($100/leg). Basic, sorry about your luck. We asked about our carryons, she weighed them and said we were good (no tags added to bags). When we got to London to board our Barcelona flight, staff made us pay +$80 for our carry ons. When we said the lady in the USA weighed them and said they were good, she said “just because the US can’t do their job, doesn’t mean I won’t do mine!” Then, she let a teenager with a much larger/heavier bag go through (no additional charges).

### "following their policies"
Chicago to Malaga return via Gatwick. Check in at O'Hare in Chicago was great, counter agents weighed and accepted both my checked and cabin baggage. At Gatwick the same cabin baggage was overweight and a £70 fee was required to continue. My checked baggage was slightly underweight and I could have shifted the load but it was not an option at Gatwick. I requested a refund from the airline but their response is that no refund is possible as they were following their policies in Gatwick.

### "Overall a great flight"
Gatwick to Oslo. A fairly good flight. Crew was very nice and helpful. The aircraft seemed new and was clean. The flight went smoothly, though the landing was hard, which is agreeable as the runway may have been icy. The flight was delayed by 40-50 minutes because of a gate change. Overall a great flight. I would recommend it to other travelers.

### " airline is fine and does a job"
Gatwick to Singapore. If you cannot afford to fly another airline then this airline is fine and does a job. If you can pay more then do, flying Norwegian for a long period of time is uncomfortable. However we all fly these airlines for a reason and that is money - if it is that much cheaper than the next one then go for it.

### "they rebooked my flight to the next day"
Malaga to Las Vegas via Gatwick. Their tickets may be cheap, but they get you with the $100-$250 for a checked bag and more if your bag is overweight. After boarding the plane and waiting for an hour with no updates on why we were waiting, they made us get off the plane and proceeded to tell us our flight was cancelled because Gatwick Airport had closed. I had little money and no idea what to do. They had only two employees helping 60 or more angry customers. Since I was patient and not rude, I was pushed to the back of the line and ended up waiting 6 hours before I finally made my way up to the counter and someone quickly helped me. They rebooked my flight to the next day to Gatwick that was currently closed, then sent me to a hotel. I had little money so barely enough for the taxi to get to the hotel. They said they would reimburse me in the morning. I had to pay $50 dollars to get to the hotel and back, and was not reimbursed. I have receipts from the taxis and everything, yet they refused to reimburse me because “the hotel was suppose to pay for it” how was I supposed to know that? I ended up booking another $1300 flight to get home, knowing Gatwick had been closed on the date of my original flight. Their phone lines were down all night which is why I had to rebook, since I had no status that the airport had opened. I asked for a refund and they looked at me like I was pathetic. It’s not my fault I spent my last money on overpriced taxis that I didn’t need to take.

### "no food or drinks are provided free"
Los Angeles to Paris. My flight on 22nd December started with an hour of delay, which can happen. I was surprised that no food or drinks are provided free beside the purchases at an expensive rate. It's the first time I see that, probably the meal is included in the price with other companies but it was so much cheaper. The comfort wasn't great also: I'm not very tall (6'2 -188cm) but the seats are small and you can get constantly woke up by people running into your legs if you happen to be on the sides. For the pretty expensive price of the ticket (650$ for one way, without check-in baggage), I think the service provided doesn't worth the price.

### "was denied boarding pass"
New York to Dubai via Stockholm. I reached the airport at 8 pm for 1030 pm flight. There was a long queue and when they announced Stockholm passengers should come forward, I rushed to the counter. At the counter the attendant said there is some visa issue and I should go to supervisor. The supervisor said she needed to speak with the customs. When everything was cleared she says there is no problem and she can give the boarding pass. But the check in has closed. When I called customer care they said I should have called 30 mins before departure. I called as soon as I the supervisor told me to call customer care. I had also paid 140 GBP online for my two checked in bags. And checked in online. I had done everything there was needed to be done and I still was denied boarding pass and no refund.

### "flight was cancelled"
The flight was cancelled on December 8th from Newark to Paris Orly. I always check the status the day of my departure about 2 to 3 times. Till I left and even after I arrived at the airport, the flight showed on time. I showed up to register 2 and a half hour before the flying time and was told the flight was cancelled. That it never left Paris for "technical reasons" from one of the two agents and "airport operation in Orly" from the other. No option was given to depart as soon as possible on another flight or airline, no option offered to the majority of customers coming from far or in transit for a hotel. But from that point on trying to get help from their customer service to reschedule was a nightmare. No escalation possible. No supervisor or apology.

### "The crew was lovely"
Barcelona to  Gatwick. The crew on the flight was lovely. The seats were also very comfortable and made my flight very smooth and quick. That was something I did notice though, the screens didn’t came down this time for some reason. Also, the safety demo used to be played on the screens and today it was the crew making the safety demo.

### "airline is far from a Low cost."
Copenhagen to Barcelona. Another amazing flight with Norwegian. This airline is far from a Low cost. The seats are extremely comfortable and the wiFi is amazing. We landed 30 min earlier in Barcelona. Totally recommended.

### "avoid, unless you want to gamble"
Real bargain - if you go. Got a great price, but less than 14 days before the flight, received a notice that flight was cancelled, with the terse explanation that "We are sorry to inform you about these changes, but sometimes we need to make modifications to our flight schedule". Smelled of bait-and-switch. If these folks pull this stunt on you, request compensation per EU rules (see the internet). Less than 14 days before, the airline owes you 650 per passenger. Upshot - avoid, unless you want to gamble.

### "Really hard to fault anything"
I've flown Norwegian to Stavanger, Denver USA and Canary Islands before, all from London. Really impressed with the punctuality (always on time or ahead, so far), staff (friendly but not pushy or trying to sell anything), price (not always the lowest but worth paying for the peace of mind) and plane itself (free wifi!). Took the London to Denver single trip for about 130GBP (skipped meal and blanket, brought my own) and really impressed by the new Dreamliner I flew in to Denver. For the price seats and legroom comfy, temperature felt right. They even had inflight entertainment! Really hard to fault anything. Got boarding pass via their mobile app, no probs.

### "customer service provided was excellent"
Arlanda Stockholm to Copenhagen with Norwegian. I have to say that it was one of the best flights that I have done. The boarding was quiet, the aircraft was really nice and clean and the customer service provided was excellent.

### "cabin crew were really nice"
Flew Copenhagen to Barcelona with Norwegian. The boarding was very smooth and the flight was on time. Already onboard and being a full flight could get a little noisy but that’s not the airline fault but some passengers. The cabin crew were really nice and the flight arrived on time and it was very smooth.

### "can't recommend them enough"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Los Angeles. I'd never flown with Norwegian until this year - can't recommend them enough. For a low budget airline they were amazing. Don't understand why there are so many people moaning about the food quality, variety of films etc, it's a budget airline, what do you expect? If you're looking to keep costs down and want a reliable and friendly service I would definitely recommend Norwegian!

### "One of the best flights"
Stockholm to Copenhagen. One of the best flights I have done. Super quick and on time. The cabin crew were amazing and the customer service provided was excellent. Super quick boarding and super comfortable.

### "Really enjoyed my flight"
Barcelona to Oslo. Really enjoyed my flight with Norwegian. The service is great from the cabin crew and the confirm of the seats are just amazing. The flight was on time and it got to the destination earlier even. Just an amazing airline to fly with.

### "I was very surprised"
Oslo to New York-JFK, chosen because their tickets were very cheap and I was very surprised. In their Boeing 787 economy there is a lot of space, entertainment system is very up-to-date, meal onboard prices are reasonable, crew is okay. We also got a free water, coffee and complimentary snack in the middle of the flight. I felt very safe and comfortable! Only thing I can complain about is missing wi-fi.

### "outbound trip meal was terrible"
The flight from Boston to Gatwick was not bad. My outbound trip meal was terrible. The overhead luggage compartments were dirty. Same on the trip back. The meal back I selected the beef which was much tastier than the chicken on outbound flight. The Norwegian Express from Sthlm to Lulea and back were a 737 and it was dirty. Seems Norwegian is run mean and efficient to keep the economy prices low and make up with standard and premium prices. Boarding the Lulea flight they allowed boarding both from rear and front cabin doors; this ended up with chaos in the cabin as persons entering from front had seats in the rear and vice versa. I will return flying Lufthansa for any future trips.

### "didn't know you had to preorder food"
Berlin to Los Angeles via Copenhagen booked through a 3rd party travel site. The boarding went fine. The seats were slightly uncomfortable, the plane was pretty full and there was a larger lady sitting next to me, who took up a lot of space but that's hardly the airlines fault. Shortly before dinner, the flight attendant spoke on the intercom about distributing the "preordered" food and I didn't know that you had to preorder food. You could pay for food on the plane but food and drinks are not included free. The entertainment system had a "award winning" touchscreen but it lagged severely and had no turn off option. The selection of movies was  pretty poor. Overall pretty terrible which I don't recommend.

### "Boeing 787 so noisy"
Las Vegas to Gatwick.n I have never encountered such discomfort on a flight, the seats made me numb after sitting in them for about half an hour. The entertainment was non-existent, inflight meals and drinks service was incredibly slow and no choice (beware if you are seated towards the back, you get what is left after the service started about 90 mins before). The staff were luck lustre and just directed me to the email address for comments. The check in which was smooth and hassle free. How can a new Boeing 787 be so noisy too? Bring your ear plugs.

### "best flight I have ever taken"
5 stars for Norwegian. First, I'm a very nervous flyer and hadn't flown in 6 years. I wanted to get off as they closed the doors and one of the pilots came out of the cabin to reassure me I'd be ok. No kidding. The flight attendants and crew were fantastic, and the pilot came out to check on me multiple times. We flew out of Paris after experiencing one of the worst cruises on Holland America MS Koningsdam where we went through hurricane force winds on the Mediterranean. The Boeing 787 was very comfortable, and very mild turbulence across the ocean. We left on time, arrived on time, and the crew was incredible. We bought economy class tickets and upgraded via bidding to premium class. It was worth the extra $200 (each). That included extra bags, food, drinks, early boarding, and airport lounge access (we didn't use that because we didn't realize it was before security at Charles de Gaulle airport). Anyway, best flight I have ever taken, and I've had multiple horrible experiences. Highly recommend Norwegian airlines.

### "Excellent flight at a great price"
Gatwick to New York JFK. Excellent flight at a great price. The entire process was simple and convenient. Courteous staff at check in. We checked a bag for an additional fee. Your carry on is weighed and approved at check in, so please be mindful of the restrictions. Separately, we had Priority Passes and enjoyed using the lounge at Gatwick. Boarding the plane was fairly orderly and the plane took off on time. We were in the center section of 3 seats across in row 38. The seats were no smaller than any other economy airline. Nothing is included with the economy ticket, but they have an on screen ordering system with lightening fast service. I ordered headphones $3 because I forgot mine and we had a few beers which were reasonably priced. Within a minute of pressing submit, the flight attendant brought us our drinks. Good selection on the movies and media content. The plane was new and clean and all the staff seemed happy to work there. I would definitely fly again.

### "an excellent experience"
Orlando to Gatwick. Originally booked on a legacy carrier by my employer who changed it to Norwegian as it saved £1800, we were travelling straight after Thanksgiving, had some reservations as only travelled with them in Europe before ∧ they are technically a LCC. Used self service kiosk boarding card & baggage tag done in 2 minutes, huge queue for bag drop, but this was for later flight to Oslo so a staff member directing Gatwick passengers to another bank of desks & completed in minutes. Boarding commenced 40 minutes before departure calling us forward according to boarding group which was very efficient, warm greeting at door by crew as i made my way to seat, aeroplane in pristine condition & very clean with more than enough baggage space. Slight delay to departure due to a couple of passengers going to wrong gate but kept updated by Captain. Once airborne the service was delivered in a very quick/ slick manner, had booked meals was very impressed to be offered a choice & complimentary wine & soft drinks with it. IFE more than adequate with a good range of entertainment, particularly liked the way you ordered refreshments/duty free via screen & its delivered to your seat in minutes having swiped you card on screen, they even allow you to run a tab & make a donation to UNICEF. Landed on schedule & bags on belt by time i got through immigration which was also 5* , well done Gatwick. All round an excellent experience & exceptional value for money, Legacy carriers watch out, they might be a LCC but they are running rings round you, they are now my first choice for Long Haul travel.

### "none of the bags was included"
New York to Tel Aviv via Stockholm. When I got to check in there was 200 people line that was moving very slow. After 90 min waiting in line I finally made it to check in only to find out that none of the bags was included and they ask $200 extra for 1 carry on and one suitcase. After that on the flight they don't even give free water. My suitcase that I paid a $100 for never made it.

### "have been nightmares"
Not Verified | Copenhagen to New York. Wow. I have flown Norwegian consistently for the last 5 years on my trips between the US and Denmark. They have previously been an inexpensive, no frills but polite and attentive experience. The last 2 trips I have taken with them have been nightmares. On one of my arrivals we were left on the tarmac for 3 hours without access to any food or water after an 8.5 hour flight. Opting out of meals, I plan to keep myself sustained for the journey and eat before departure and immediately upon arrival but when you add 3 more hours, it’s difficult to pack an unexpected meal in my carry-on. On an NYC-CPH journey I waited 1 hour 45 minutes in a line of 500 people all trying to check into 5 different flights departing with an hour of one another. It was miserable and left no time for the eat before you fly strategy. And while we were all in this ridiculous line, they had a side line for those with just carry on bags where they were weighing them to make sure that all carry ons were under 10kg max before letting them check in with the kiosk, or if they were unlucky, wait in the line to pay $100 for the bag they need to check. This doesn’t sound too unreasonable, after all rules are rules.A ridiculous experience and one that will keep me far far away from Norwegian in the future.

### "happy with the whole experience"
I flew Norwegian from Gatwick to Oakland in November this year, and just based on price the deals were stunning. Basic price with no frills was £169 each way, so £340 return to the US is absolutely terrific value. I opted for the slight upgrade of Lowfare+ so same economy seating but with meals, seat choice and 1 checked bag included, at £50 each way I thought it represented pretty good value. I never quite understand people's reviews of Airlines such as this, as if theyre expecting the utmost quality for rock bottom prices. I have been doing it a disservice by calling it the easyjet of transatlantic flights. A disservice to both easyjet and Norwegian, as easyjet are a good budget airline too, having never really let me down. When I first got on the plane I was surprised as how nice it was; clearly very new, very clean and leg room was terrific. I'm not that tall, only 6 foot 1 and relatively slender and the seat kept me complaint free for 10 hours. Service was flawless, after payment of items, it's in front of you within 30 seconds. In flight entertainment is superb, the range of films was great including some pretty up to date ones too - no clue how often they update these. Games are good enough to occupy some time, even fiddling with the flight map whiles away plenty of time. In flight food - the hot meal was very nice both flights, not haute cuisine but again its economy class and on a plane - sandwich was a bit average but did a job. Overall I was superbly happy with the whole experience, flight left on time and arrived early outbound and on time inbound. Cabin crew very friendly, plane a real gem and they even have some fancy onboard lighting intended to help sleep etc. Would 100% fly with them again, and choose them over other airlines too.

### "proved to be very decent"
Alicante to Munich. Booked a return trip to Spain on short notice. Price and flight timings were good, but I was not expecting a lot. However Norwegian proved to be very decent and did not feel as low-cost as others. Comfortable seats (pitch felt bigger then e.g. on LH), on-time, crew friendly and free Wifi made the flights pass easily. Would not hesitate to book again within Europe.

### "delayed and finally cancelled"
New York to Copenhagen. Our flight was initially for 11PM on 11/15. It was delayed, and then finally cancelled at 3AM on 11/16. We were told by a representative that they would put us in a hotel and reimburse us for travel/hotel expenses. All hotels were booked through them, but somehow we were able to find one on our own. We wake up a few hours later to confirm our flight for 11/16. After being on the phone for 1.5 hours, with most of the time being on hold, I confirmed that we had a 10:30PM flight with the representative. I even stayed on the phone to confirm that we had this flight confirmation sent to our email. We get to the airport 4-5 hours before our flight just to be told that our flight is at 2AM on 11/17. At JFK here was a customer service representative on site who was refusing to provide service to customers. As a last resort, we called the 1-800 number to speak with a representative, the conversation was worthless. No voucher was offered - nothing.

### "only serve you free water if you ask"
Gatwick to New York. They only serve you free water if you ask. Everything else you have to pay for. Very cramped seats and even if you purchased food not only is it expensive it doesn't look good. I encourage you to bring your own food and drink.

### "it was a comfortable flight"
Copenhagen to Rome on Norwegian. Overall it was a comfortable flight. They did delay departure for about 45 minutes. It might have been due to the late arrival of the crew. It was a flight in the evening so it did involve a scramble in Rome to get the last train, which was luckily delayed 30 minutes. I will always fly Norwegian as it is my low cost carrier of choice.

### "Overall a great flight"
Fort Lauderdale to Copenhagen on Norwegian. Originally I was to fly direct to Rome but they cancelled that flight. The replacement flights worked for me via Copenhagen. I was able to spend time in a business lounge in Copenhagen. The only problem I had was that the lounge did not display all flights, only international flights as it was a business lounge in the international terminal. I checked my flight using my phone and everything was okay. Norwegian did update me via email concerning a flight delay and gate number change. Overall a great flight. I will fly on Norwegian whenever possible.

### "ground service is the worst"
Dubai to Oslo. Never using Norwegian again, rude staff and poor customer service, the flight has been delayed. The ground service is the worst.

### "very tiny seats"
Rome to Newark. We booked to fly the dreamliner not Privilege Style, and did not get a text, email or any notification about the change. There was no WiFi, power stations, and very tiny seats. seats reclined back to where the person in front of me was in my face. The person behind me kept kneeing me in the back and verbally asked me to push my seat up, even complaining to the staff that my seat was "too far back". I had no leg room for a 10 hour flight. They had 2 movies playing, that ran on Re-run and then no TV for the next 5 hours. Why would Norwegian change our flight and not notify us?

### "not fly Norwegian ever again"
Copenhagen to Ft Lauderdale. On flight back home from Copenhagen on November 4, 2018, I had to pay $92.10 for my carry on bag. According to the attendant at the gate and ready to board, I was only allowed to bring on two hands bags to the plane. I was carrying my purse  (small), my small carry on luggage and the shopping bag from my duty free purchase, so according to her this was considered hand luggage as well. Never in all the airlines I have flown before ( and it’s been many) have they considered my duty free bag as a carry on. Therefore she made me checked in my carry on luggage and pay 92.10. Mind you they do not advised you of this at the check in counter, but waited until I was at the gate to tell me and off course charge this outrageous amount. If I would have known, I would have not purchased a thing. According to one of the attendants there was plenty of room in this flight. They even charge you for headphones. Norwegian, advise your customer at  check in that you are only allowed to bring two bags on the plane, and that the duty free shopping bag, no matter how small, will be considered a hand luggage. As for me and my family and friends will not fly Norwegian ever again.

### "assured our luggage was on the plane"
The flight was generally ok. As stated by many others you get what you pay for so it is very basic. But the customer service after the flight is really shockingly bad and unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. Our luggage got lost at JFK. When we were checking in the printer for the luggage tags wasn’t working so the ground staff told us to just proceed to the gate and then we would receive our luggage confirmation there. When we got there the lady from the check-in wasn’t present and none of her colleagues could help us out. We were however assured our luggage was on the plane. When arriving in Amsterdam the luggage however was nowhere to be found and we subsequently filed a missing luggage report. From that moment on things just went from bad to worse. Firstly Norwegian only seems to be willing to correspond with customers via email as it is virtually impossible to speak to someone on the phone. Then finally after 4 months of email ping-pong and filling out forms we have now finally received some minimum compensation (based on the Montreal Convention) but just for one passenger while the luggage of 3 passengers got lost. When asking for an explanation they just refer to a complaints procedure and then immediately state that they don’t acknowledge these international standards anyway. It really is a shame that this airline treats its customers so appallingly. I will never fly with them again and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. We were penny wise pound foolish to fly with Norwegian.

### "Bad business practices"
Rome to Los Angeles. Bad business practices from Norwegian. I will try and keep this review brief and just explain that my review is solely based on Norwegians delay and cancelled flights policies. We flew from Lax to Denmark and Denmark to Rome in September with zero issues. Flight was nice, Service on flight was good, Movie/TV selections dated and need updating and food was average for international. Flight back was another story. Should have been a simply Rome to Lax direct flight. Original flight time was for 5:55am. Night before the flight, received a text/email stating flight delay until 2pm. Heading to the airport, received another message stating flight delay again, now until 6pm. Waiting at the airport through 2 delays guess, what happens next, received another text/message stating flight delay but this time it stated, no expected departure time. Had to wait it out at the airport with no information from any Norwegian representative on a timeframe to depart just given food and drink tickets not understanding that sitting at an airport for 9 hours at this point with no timetable to leave at 65 years old is not ideal. After waiting another 6 hours, we finally get word the flight has been cancelled. 1am in the morning with no Norwegian representatives available or open since all desks are closed, they cancel the flight and tell us to call Norwegian. You call and its says there are 2 hour wait times to reach someone. They stated the next available flight to get home is 2 days from now or they can do a 3 stop transfer totaling 21 hours flight time. Or they said, we can just refund your ticket. We had to pay $2000 per ticket to get home through another airline instead of the $500 ticket we already had through Norwegian. The more I read about these Norwegian planes having technical issues, the more I understand how all the money is being put into fixing these planes instead of fixing the business practice side of the company. You get what you pay for pretty much. We saw a cheaper ticket compared to other airlines and now understand why. To know that an airline is okay with cancelling a flight without offering alternative flights for over a day later should be upsetting to most. Especially at the end of a vacation when you are trying to get home and are told you cant because our plane is broken, again. Seems all Norwegian complaints are about these broken planes. My reviews ratings on this are solely based on flight back and not flight to since the bad overwhelms the good in this case.

### "would avoid this carrier like the plague"
Not Verified |  Norwegian Air is clearly the Grayhound Bus in the air. While their website touts a better customer experience with lounge access for its premium cabin, a customer would be better off flying one of the major carriers in an economy middle seat. Everything from the worst lounge in the western world at JFK, to seats where you can not get out of, to non-existent flight attendants, I would avoid this carrier like the plague.

### "you get what you pay for"
New York to Rome. I am an understanding guy, that believes you get what you pay for, there for going into this flight my expectations were not high but I had previously used Norwegian for an international flight which was great and that experience had probably increased my expectations. This trip I wouldn’t call it horrible because I got from point A to point B and back with out any major issues. Price for my last minute trip was great 2-the staff seemed to be nice and helpful to those who required help. It is impossible to get anything done in their app it’s pretty much useless, it doesn’t let you check in, and it doesn’t give you any updates on your flight. ( my flight changed gates at the lst minute). They used a secondary company for this leg called Privilege Styles (I didn’t feel privileged at all). The plane had no entertainment system, they did have a screen in front of you which on 1 flight didn’t work in any seat on my row, and on the other flight the remote control/phone thing was cut out of my seat. My seat didn’t recline and the seat in front was reclined so that was a bad combination. The bathroom had visibly missing pieces but they worked, I generally don’t want to see missing pieces on my airplane, one of them also had a big out of service sign.

### "it was really good in general"
Gatwick to La Palma. This airline is one of those airlines which you have no expectations, as the flights are so cheap. The crew where friendly and very sorry for the delay (and on our return to), apart from the delay, it was really good in general, the Wifi was fast and there was no delay when sending messages. The flight was smooth, enough legroom and comfy seating. You could watch live TV and TV shows, directly from your device and you could rent films, with costed 5 euros. There wasn't a huge selection, but enough to keep you entertained for 4 hours. You could do other things from your app, like seeing whats at your destinations (which you could get discounts on) as well as flight maps and so on. The only thing that would ever stop me from flying them again is the delays, as my flight was delayed by about 2 hours, and one flight on the day was delayed by about 15 hours, which I was fairly shocked at. Apart from the delays, everything else is what your paying for.

### "Super cheap tickets"
Cork to Providence. Super cheap tickets. Seats uncomfortable, and when I asked for water they said I could to buy a $3 bottle or wait for the snack cart. I get a foreign transaction fee and my card wouldn’t work on the plane. I am beyond disappointed. Flight was on time and smooth. Only pros along with the initial price.

### "Horrible service"
Not Verified | I was flying with Norwegian on October 15th 2018 from Helsinki to Malaga. It was the most horrible flight in my life! The cabin crew was extremely unfriendly. Not even hello or goodbye. I asked two of the flight attendants if it was possible to change my window seat because im a little bit aerophobic and feel dizzy when I sit next to the window but they just ignored me! Horrible service. Would never recommend to fly with them.

### "request for a full refund"
Paris to New York. The flight was operated by WAMOS as a substitute carrier. I booked two flights for two people on Norwegian, with reserved seats and in Premier Class (which includes a free bag and meal and more comfortable seat). Before both flights, I received a notice of a change of aircraft but was told the only difference would be in the entertainment system. The airline was chartering a substitute plane from WAMOS, a Spanish company with the most inept crew I have ever seen. It would have been Fawlty-Towers funny except that the crew clearly did not know how to operate the equipment. On my second flight, I was informed that in spite of having booked 6 months early, I was being downgraded to coach. Sorry, but I was assured that I would still get the meal and would get a refund of 75%. On board, the very surly attendant refused to give me a meal or even water, because, "You did not pay". I assured her that I had paid and it was for premium class. Nevertheless, she pointedly ignored me for the rest of the flight. When I went to the galley to complain, the crew was hanging out, ignoring everyone's call buttons (which they claimed didn't work - along with the reading lights, the overhead screens, etc). Finally, the attendant brought me a meal but when I pointed out that my companion needed one, too, she snatched it away and never returned. I submitted a request for a full refund. I have not had any response.

### "eight weeks for this to be processed"
Paris to Denver. About six months ago I booked a return flight in mid-November 2018. The airline cancelled the flight (and apparently the route) in mid-September. Only unacceptable alternatives were proposed, so I requested a refund. Although the application has been acknowledged, I have been told that I need to wait at least eight weeks for this to be processed, even though as a straightforward and uncontroversial cancellation the processing would be minimal. I have never come across a major company taking this amount of time to issue a refund for a purchase in which they are admittedly at fault. A month in, I have just been told it will be another five weeks.

### "airline sells cheaper tickets"
Not Verified | We booked what we thought was a regular airline through booking.com for a reasonable fare. I admit not doing a lot of research into Norwegian beforehand as all European carriers I had used before have been good, usually providing better service than American carriers. We were in for a very different experience. On the way to Paris, a midnight flight, we noticed that everyone on the plane was happy to sleep as were we. The leg room was adequate, though the plane seemed rather old. On the return trip, we got an even older plane, with the smallest leg room I have ever had in an economy class. The reading light did not work, the seat could not lean back, which was worse since the seat in front was broken and permanently leaned back. There was no on board entertainment, but I was told it was being streamed to mobile devices. However, the plane was too old to have USB chargers for such devices. I found out that this airline sells cheaper tickets without food and drink service. I will not fly this airline again.

### "5* flight both ways"
Not Verified |  5* flight both ways. Booked exit seats both ways so had plenty of room. Meals included really god which also included wine. Both flights on time. Return to Gatwick 1st flight in so straight through passport control etc. £350 return you can’t complain .

### "The price was cheap"
Paris to Orlando. We flew on this airline to and from Europe from Texas in October 2018, into Gatwick and out of Paris. The planes were delayed both times by more than 2 hours, the food was terrible. The price was cheap but you get what you pay for and the lengthy delays will cost you in additional time and expense when you have to book new flights or reroute yourself when you arrive late and miss your connection, plus have to get a hotel to stay over night.

### "splitting up a family"
Rome to Oakland. We were not sure about flying with a discount airline as a family, but the direct flight back to Oakland from Rome was hard to pass up at the price offered. We paid for a reserved bulkhead seats with access to the bassinet, 6 months ahead of our flight. On arrival to the airport in Rome we were informed that our seats were no longer together. We were not informed of any changes to our booking in the 6 month period between booking and arrival at the airport, which is very disappointing and frustrating. As you may be able to imagine flying with a young child is difficult enough, but to separate a family without informing them, and then having no recourse upon arrival at the airport for our flight is extremely frustrating. We were at the mercy of our fellow passengers to be able to fly seated together, and to do so we had to give up our bulkhead seats, and access to a bassinet. This made our 12 hour flight very uncomfortable. I'm amazed that they would consider splitting up a family travelling with an infant without any notification or option to change seating arrangement, especially given that we paid for our seat reservation.

### "a surprisingly comfortable journey"
Flew Norwegian from Singapore to London Gatwick. Check-in at Singapore went much more smoothly than a year earlier, thanks to only Singaporean staff being present! Once onboard, it was a surprisingly comfortable journey for a budget airline on such a long haul. No free food or drinks if course, but still a personal entertainment system.

### "our flight was canceled"
Rome to Oakland via Copenhagen. We were at the checkin early in Rome. They failed to notify us that our connecting flight to Oakland had already been canceled. They checked us in anyway and had our bags marked for Oakland. We got to Copenhagen and found out ourselves that our flight was canceled and there was nothing for days. Norwegian would not answer the phone so we had to deal with a ticket agency for hours to fight to get a way out! They then informed us that our bags were left on the turnstile in Copenhagen and were now in limbo! We finally got a flight to L A and after a long layover we got sent to San Francisco not Oakland. We were then on our own to get to our car in Oakland. The flight to LA was packed and we could not sit together. Flight staff was borderline rude instead of sympathetic. I will never fly with them again.

### "punctuality appalling"
Gatwick to Denver return. Aircraft brilliant, airline punctuality appalling. Smooth transition through Gatwick. At Gate when Premium called to board but left standing at Gate for 20/25 mins. No explanation given. Once onboard, announcement made that the aircraft needed to be rebalanced (luggage) which we were told would take 5/10 mins. 30 minutes later, we were told the aircraft had to be re-fuelled, which would be a further 5/10 minutes. 30 minutes later, the aircraft left the Gate. Having missed our slot, we eventually in the air nearly 2 hours late. Arrived at Denver on 4th Oct to be told at check in that flight delayed from 14.35 to 17.10. Check in staff amazed when I said I knew nothing about the delay. Norwegian had constantly bombarded my Inbox with various “offers” of upgrades, reminders etc, including one email on the day of departure but no notification at all of delay. They also had my mobile number. The Captain was later to explain the delayed departure was due to an earlier late arrival into Seattle - Norwegian knew many, many hours before that the flight from Denver would likewise be delayed. The aircraft was brilliant but the  lack of customer care & service cancelled that. The continual telling of half truths was also disappointing. Never again for me. I would rather pay more and be treated honestly and courteously. You get what you pay for.

### "crew were polite and efficient"
Not Verified |  I flew from Gatwick to Kefalonia with Norwegian Air on 20th September and back on 27th. The crew were polite and efficient. Drinks and snacks were surprisingly budget friendly. Plenty of legroom which was a pleasant surprise. No in flight entertainment as it was a short flight. I would certainly pay a bit more to fly with this airline compared to other budget airlines. Although I booked through a travel agent - I have looked at the booking procedure and it is a very easy site to navigate with clear pricing instructions.

### "charge for earplugs and blankets"
Amsterdam to New York. As a low-cost airline they charge for earplugs and blankets, and don’t serve free food or beverages during the flight. You have to pay for everything only with credit card they don’t accept cash. Low space between the seats (31-32" seat pitch) especially in the back of the plane.

### "we were pleasantly surprised"
Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale. After reading all the negative reviews we were pleasantly surprised how well everything went. At check in at both ends we arrived 3 hours before departure and were met with small queues and cheery staff. On the first leg we were boarded on time but had a 40 minute delay waiting for a connecting flight but the flight on the return left on time and arrived 30 mins early. The cabin crew were polite and efficient and anything ordered arrived promptly. The back of seat entertainment consoles were easy to use but the content was poor compared to others. On the return the plane was only 3 months old but my wife's screen did not work. There was one proper meal served which was the same as other airlines and just before arriving you had a snack. If you wanted extra drinks you had to pay for them but the prices were reasonable. The biggest difference between Norwegian and other long haul airlines is the seat space on Norwegian it is similar to Ryanair. If you are tall you are really going to find the space cramped. Eating a meal was difficult as there was so little elbow room. All this has to be taken into consideration with the price paid. I paid £280 return via opodo including seat assignment, 2 meals and 2 bags in the hold so I cant complain. On leaving the flight we walked through premium economy which looked much larger then other airlines. We spoke to somebody who had used the Norwegian option to bid for a seat upgrade and managed to get a premium seat for just £100 and was well satisfied.

### "delayed by almost 4 hrs"
The flight from Los Angeles to Paris was delayed by almost 4 hrs, and I missed a separate flight from Paris to Prague. This led to additional costs such as booking a night of hotel in Paris (I missed the last 2 alternative flights), as well as paying for a new ticket to Prague. A nightmare, and Norwegian are not liable for any of the costs because the delay of their flight out of Los Angeles was not their fault.

### "There is no meal provided"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Chicago. The ticket was reasonably cheap, but they forced me to check my carry-on during the check-in process. I had to pay $90 for that. There is no meal provided, you have to pre-order it and they did not provide a complimentary drink - you have to pay. I was in an aisle seat and constantly got bumped. I didn't blame the other passengers as much, but when my seat got bumped by a cart and also by a crew member, they should have known to be more careful.

### "Never again Norwegian"
Our flight from LAX to Rome went off as expected. Slight delay (30 minutes) for take off - nothing major. In-flight services were as expected. Getting from Rome to LAX, a whole different story. We had gotten 2 flight updates (post booking, but well before our flight from LAX to Rome) with small time changes (1-2 Hour differential). Our original flight was scheduled at 5:55AM. We got a notification at 9PM the day before, that our flight was then rescheduled to 5:55PM. Annoying, but not the end of the world. We then got another update in the morning, our flight was now scheduled at 5:00PM. At approximately 2:00PM, we got a notification, our flight was delayed further to 2:15AM (following day). Unfortunately, Norwegian doesn't have employees at Rome airport - just a private company to handle Checking-In luggage and issuing boarding passes. The staff representing Norwegian had no influence or support as far as re-booking or re-scheduling flights. We get back to the airport at 10:00PM to start the boarding process again. Everyone checks in their luggage, and we get escorted into a private security line to get to our gate. Our boarding passes that were just issued, apparently were Invalid, and so none of us could get through security. By about 1AM, we all got another notification the flight was cancelled. It's literally 1 in the morning. Nobody is at the airport to support. Call lines into Norwegian were at a 2-Hour hold. An absolute nightmare. Flights that day to get back home to LAX ended up being $3,000. Some people we had met ended up forking it out in hopes that Norwegian would cover the reimbursement. And zero support on the ground by Norwegian. Call in wait on hold for 2 hours to get support? When you've already been at the airport for 30+ hours at that point. Was there even a flight scheduled at 2:15AM? Never again Norwegian.

### "Zero customer service"
Not Verified |  I would never recommend anyone fly this airline! We got to the airport today and they told us they downgraded our flight from Preimium Economy to Economy with no notification. They said this is not their problem and there is nothing they can do! We flew premium economy LAX to CDG and the seats were very uncomfortable as it was. There’s absolutely no leg room with the economy seats. Zero customer service and other than the fact that they have new planes very uncomfortable and terrible food. Not only did they downgrade our seats but now they will not give us access to the premium economy food either or access to the lounge!

### "fairly impressed with the service"
I flew from Oakland direct on the dreamliner to Copenhagen Sept 8th, returning on the 21st from Stockholm, again direct on the dreamliner. In between I flew 3 other times in Scandinavia on Norwegian 737's. I have to say that I was fairly impressed with the service I received. Check in was easy at each airport. Service attendants both in the airport and on the plane were friendly. ALL 5 flights took off on time and we're uneventful. I do not usually check luggage, but my carry-on was going to be a little heavier than their restrictions so I paid the lowfare+ fare. This gave me seat assignment, a meal and one checked bag up to 20kg. Norwegian did not lose my bag on any of these flights and the luggage process was quite efficient. My friend accidently checked her bag to Oslo instead of Oakland. I was staying on in Oslo and saw her bag when I went to get mine. I immediately took it to the Norwegian service desk and the employee actually ran the bag to her flight! It was the first one off in Oakland! I would have to say the food and entertainment selection were just average. The window shade and continual air were cool on the plane: seat size average. Pricing was great! Overall, from these 5 flights I would rate Norwegian an 8 out of 10.

### "really positive experience"
Los Angeles to Gatwick. Had read a really mixed-bag of reviews on Norwegians Transatlantic service, but decided to try it and was pleasantly surprised. First time on a B787 and loved it, loads of space, comfortable seat and enjoyed the food and drinks served. Staff were great and both flights were on time. A really positive experience.

### "done with Norwegian"
I have flown Norwegian Air in the past, and have always raved to others about their low cost premium economy service. But no more! The standard of judgment for a company is how they handle things when something goes wrong. And when something goes wrong at Norwegian - do not expect any help at all. I was traveling with my elderly mother and daughter this summer. We flew Oakland to Gatwick, premium economy. This was especially important, as my mother is 80, and needs a little extra service than standard economy. Flight there was uneventful. 2 days before our return flight, I received a text message telling me there had been a plane change and we had been downgraded. I then spent the new 2 days trying to reach a live person who could at least get me seat assignments. No go. At times we sat on hold for a hour+, and I was told there was nothing they could do. I just wanted to make sure we'd get fed, and that I could sit with my mother. No one could help, there are no "supervisors" you can speak to. All you can do is open a case. You are not told that the average time to respond to a case is 8 weeks. We were told over and over that we would still receive our premium meals, but no there were no extra premium meals, and so we were fed whatever was left over after meal service. The flight crew was overwhelmed with all of the premium passengers in non-premium seats, as they were not told of the issue. I wrote a letter after our return. Again, it was assigned a case #, and then nothing. After 6 weeks I was issued a partial credit, but was never allowed to speak to anyone beyond a low-level customer service agent. We're done with Norwegian.

### "below my expectations"
The fare was very low and that was my first experience with Norwegian. Everything else besides the low fare was below my expectations. My reservations listed the aircraft as B787 but was surprised that it turned out to be B737. When I asked the flight attendant how come it's not a B787, his response "it's never a B737 on this route" answered in such a sarcastic tone bordering on rude. The flight attendants resembled unfriendly bus attendants. Seats were very uncomfortable and no entertainment system for a long flight was not that great. So again the one way low fare was the only thing going well. If you can tolerate all the other annoyances then go for it.

### "cannot fault the flight"
Gatwick to New York JFK. I cannot fault the flight I took or Norwegian's long haul product, which overall is great for the value and choice it offers. Boarding was efficient and as a result the flight on the way out pushed back early, took off on-time and arrived early. Similar on the return. It was operated with a new, well maintained and clean Boeing 787 and the crew were professional, attentive, friendly and immaculately turned out. The best thing is the ability to order drinks and snacks instantly on the seat-back touchscreen and these were always delivered within 5 minutes throughout the flight. Entertainment choices were decent. If you don't check luggage or order the meal (which I didn't) you can get a return to NY during the summer season for around £300, which really is amazing value. Far superior to British or American legacy carriers I have flown on the same route.

### "never fly with them again"
New York to Gatwick. A complete shambles from start to finish. After booking premium seats with Norwegian to travel to and from New York we received an email a couple of days before departure to say the flight had been changed and would be operated by Wamos. My friend and I had never heard of them but looking at reviews of the airline we decided not to travel with them and changed to Norwegian a day earlier, thus incurring the cost of an extra night in the New York hotel. For comfort/entertainment / food and cabin crew the Norwegian flight was average. The day before returning from NY on the 18th September we received an email to say the flight had once again been changed, our seats downgraded to economy and the flight would be operated by Air Europa. After setting up a chat to Norwegian the agent informed us that the next available Norwegian flight would not be until 24th September and no premium seats would be available until 29th September. Basically the agent was not interested and abruptly terminated the chat in mid sentence. We telephoned Norwegian and during the call were passed to two different agents who were both unhelpful. We were offered the usual 75% refund etc etc. Looking into those options it seems passengers have to wait an awfully long time to receive any compensation. We arrived at JFK for our flight earlier than advised and spent 30 minutes with the check in agents endeavouring to get our premium seats reinstated. We were lucky but there would have been 20+ passengers who would have not been so lucky. The Air Europa aircraft was had seen better days, had very limited entertainment, no pre ordered food, and my friends seat was broken. The only positive was the crew who seemed professional and helpful. There seems to be no point in booking a premium seat with Norwegian as it is a complete lottery as to whether you will get one. In fact it will be pot luck whether it will be Norwegian Air or one of the more obscure airlines they are using to replace many of their flights. I would never fly with them again.

### "they refused to upgrade me"
Paris to New York booked for later in September. I chose them over other companies because I trusted the safety standards and wanted to travel the Boeing 787, but a few days before the flight they texted me that the operator changed to Wamos would operate the flight, which offered no entertainment at all on board and operates flights with much lower standards. They said I could rebook or get a refund: but on the weekend during which I had to travel all direct flights to NY were operated by Wamos plus a refund would not really help because I booked the tickets 1 month in advance to make sure the price was ok (589euros). That means that even if I got a refund I would never be able to rebook another flight with another airline 6 days before my flight with the same price. Therefore the damage would not be remedied. Since they refused to upgrade me or refund me for the difference of service provided, I am not booking with Norwegian again.

### "still waiting for a reply"
Paris to Stockholm. 9pm flight cancelled one hour before departure via sms for "airline curfew" and we will be flying tomorrow afternoon at 2.50pm. Waited at the gate for Norwegian staff, some third party staff turn up. They know nothing apparently, just found out too. We get our checked luggage back, no information whatsoever so we wait by the check-in desks. Then I see some people writing something so I go over and I'm told I have to write down my name on a sheet of paper, and if I need a room. Later (we were sitting on the floor) I see the staff handling some paper to some people. No official announcements were made. I go over only to find out that they handling hotel vouchers and as I'm travelling alone, told I have to wait (incredibly rude Paris Orly airport staff  who can't speak english). Me and 3 other passengers are made to wait until the end (is it a crime to travel alone ? ), then we are told we have to share a room. Excuse me, sharing a room with complete strangers? The French staff doesn't care and is very dismissive of the complaints. French is my mother tongue so I clearly heard them speaking between themselves and making fun of the passengers. No respect whatsoever. We were given a customer service number that didn't work, no actual Norwegian staff on sight. Then we waited for transportation to the hotels, poorly arranged again as they've ordered small vans (6 to 8 people) for 80+ passengers so you'd had to wait for the vans to come back. They didn't even start with the families or disabled people! Arrived at the airport past midnight only to see a long queue of passengers waiting to check in. Only one receptionist and guess what, no enough rooms were booked by Norwegian. 44 of us were left waiting for the airline to call us back to tell us where to stay. They gave us the address and told you to order cabs ourselves, and keep the receipts for refunds. Guess what, we've checked the address and it was the hotel next door which was only 2 minutes walk away. So 2am I finally got a room, with no air con (29 degrees that day in Paris), slept badly. Asked the receptionist in the morning what time they were coming to pick us up and take us to the airport, they told me they had no information from Norwegian. I asked them to call the airline and found out they were coming at 10.30am but somehow forgot to inform us. As our flight was at 2.50pm, we were of course way too early for checking in so we had to wait around. Our boarding passes didn't work, we had to wait 40 minutes for the situation to be cleared, same story at the security and departure gates with boarding passes blocked. Apart from a breakfast at the hotel, no drinks or food was provided, no lunch vouchers, not even some water on the plane (you have to pay for water). Oh and they changed the gate number at the last minute, without informing us of course. Plane left late. I could go on and on about everything that went wrong with Norwegian. This was my first (and last) experience flying with them. I've logged an online claim a month ago and still waiting for a reply. Shameful behaviour, no respect whatsoever for their customers.

### "ticket is now economy class"
Paid for an premium ticket on Norwegian. Was told a week in advance that the flight would be operated by Air Europa. I called - they said I was moved to business class, but I could cancel or get a partial refund. Since I was in business class, I accepted the change. A week later, I arrive to LGW, to be told that my ticket is now economy class. Nothing can be done. No advance notification. Only can receive a refund if I apply online. Still not clear how to do that.

### "entitled to refunds"
My family of 4 was due to fly on Norwegian on Sunday 5 August from Chania to Gatwick. Whilst waiting to board we were told that a crew member had exceeded maximum flying hours and the flight would be delayed – later amended to cancellation. Some people received this news by email. The plane took off empty for its return flight. One member of airport staff tried to find information and eventually said that accommodation would be found for one night, but that passengers had to find their own alternative flights back. The Norwegian alternatives online were a 12hr+ flight on Monday via Stockholm, an overnight stop in Oslo on the Tuesday, or the next direct flight would be Thursday 9th. Everyone was trying to access the internet and any alternative flights were quickly fully booked. There was no assistance for those who did not have internet access. Anyone wanting to wait for the Thursday direct flight was told they would not get accommodation refunded. No transfers would be paid for either. Eventually we managed to book a BA flight from Heraklion  on Monday 6th at our own expense. We were fortunately allowed to go back to our hotel for 1 night, and additionally incurred taxi fares for the 3 hour trip to Heraklion, plus meals. Our travel insurers told us that the claim should be first through the Airline, and the holiday company we booked through (Love Holidays) say the same. We have claimed the £1250+ spent, but having signed up to a Facebook Group “Norwegian Airlines Experiences from Hell”, discover that over 1800 people have or have had issues with this airline, and we are fearful of not receiving either our expenses or compensation/refunds. Another passenger from our flight has already had his claim refused due to "staff sickness being an exceptional circumstance" (which it is not). The worst part is not knowing in this situation what you should do. We were fortunate that we could put alternative flights on credit card, but they still have to be paid for, and we feel totally abandoned. We know that we are entitled to refunds and compensation, but do not have any confidence that we will get them. Have been refused by travel insurers and holiday booking company, all of whom say it is the responsibility of the airline.

### "completely false economy"
Boston to Gatwick. My family of four arrived at Boston airport at 5pm on Fri 10th August for an 8:30pm flight back to Gatwick, to find that our flight had been cancelled. We were redirected from the baggage drop queue (5 desks open and no one in the queue) to a separate desk where there was just one local rep. We were the 8th group in the queue so about 20 people in front of us (the family at the front of the queue had been there since 3pm). After about an hour with no progress, and now about 150 people in the queue behind us, I asked the staff at the five check-in desks if someone else could help and maybe a supervisor could come and let people know what was happening. About half an hour later, three people were helping the one family at the front, and a supervisor started advising people in the queue that they would either have to sort themselves a hotel and contact Customer Services for a flight home (but that wouldn't be before next Wednesday as no available seats), or find your own way home and claim. By that stage my wife had spent 30mins listening to Norwegian Customer Services apologising for the unusually long call times (and the family at the front of the queue had spent 3hrs talking to Customer Services and the local rep, as they had to get home that night), so my son and I started looking for alternate flights - staying 5 nights in a hotel and losing the income for taking extended unplanned "vacation" would have cost more than re-routing via another airline. Much to our surprise a number of flight shops were still advertising the Norwegian flight as having seats available, but we ignored that and managed to get on a BA flight home. That did unfortunately mean we returned to Heathrow instead of Gatwick about 12hrs later than planned, so incurring additiona taxi, parking and dog kennel fees, but at least we were home, albeit with a rather larger holiday bill than expected. Claim was submitted on Wed 15th August and no news. Couple of interesting additional irritating points. we were declined entrance into the lounge in Boston as despite having paid for premium tickets we didn't have premium boarding passes. We contacted Flight Centre to find out why we hadn't been informed of the flight cancellation and they provided screen shots of data received form Norwegian showing that on Friday morning the status of our booking was FK4 (meaning 4 seats confirmed) and the next status received was FLWN (meaning flown) - they would only have alerted us if the status had been changed to FX4 (meaning flight cancelled). It's now 5 weeks since I submitting a claim for costs and compensation and, despite a target response time of three weeks, I still haven't heard anything. All their Customers Service folks will say is that I'm in the queue! Also worth noting that instead of the new planes on their website, our outbound flight was in a 20yr old plane with broken seats so people sit in other seats, no working entertainment, extremely cramped / uncomfortable, and cabin crew that could barely string together a coherent sentence in English.

### "had no representatives available"
First experience has been terrible so far! I live 2 hours from JFK and drove here, checked in and was waiting for takeoff only to receive a text message saying the flight was canceled and to proceed back to my home if possible. The airline said there was no problem with the plane, they just didn’t have a crew. Seriously? They had no representatives available to answer questions. Customers were left stranded and after waiting 36 minutes to speak with a customer service representative on the phone (bc no one was in person) they told me I would need to submit a claim on their website, but they were not sure the airline would refund any sort of credit for the inconvenience. Never flying them again! The flight is now rebooked for 13 hours later which will land us in London after midnight, at an airport 90 minutis a outside the city, with no public transportation running at that hour. They also said if the airline did issue any refund it wouldn’t process for 4-6 weeks. Shameful! Norwegian needs to be held accountable for their service!

### "frustrating and disappointing"
Newark to Paris Orly return. Afternoon of departure received text msg notice that flight was canceled. No further info on line, other than instruction to rebook. However, nothing was available for more than a week. Called both US and Norway customer service lines but gave up after 2 hours on hold. Booked round trip on another airline, obviously at greatly increased fare. Also missed connection, which was non-refundable. Norwegian's opening bid was to compensate us only for the segment they canceled, on the theory that we couldn't predict that the return leg would be canceled, too. Eventually, they agreed to compensate us for both legs on their airline, but none of the significant excess cost we incurred as a result of the cancellation. I have flown Norwegian before without incident, but the failure of customer service puts this airline firmly in the not worth the savings category. Exceptionally frustrating and disappointing.

### "definitely fly them again"
Copenhagen to Orlando. Amazing flight! Everything was fine. Flight departed with a small delay but arrived on time. Aircraft was new and very modern. Would definitely fly with them again!

### "downgraded to economy"
New York JFK to Paris. I booked our flight 9 months prior to departure seats selected and confirmed for 1A/1C Printed my itinerary, checkin in online and printed our travel documents still showing premium with seats 1A/1C on the day before and morning of departure Walk up the premium checkin line hand our bags to agent. Agent asks for our passports, scans them and states you have been downgraded to economy. I was devastated, asking how can this happen i have printed documents from 9 months upon booking and from check in showing our seat assignments? His reply was they overbooked and take the seats from the lowest priced paid for premium, and that we would be refunded 75% of the ticketed price. I chose business class with Norwegian knowing it was economy, traveling overnite, we didn’t want nor need food or drinks, we only wanted to be able to sleep fairly comfortably. My question to Norwegian - you have our emails / tel# when was it decided that you overbooked ? Why wouldn’t they contact us  and give us the option of rebooking with a better airline in the fashion we choose and paid to travel We will never fly Norwegian again!

### "it's hard to beat"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to New York JFK. Opted for this airline on trip from Prague due to best connection times in AMS and late departure from JFK inbound. Booked 3 weeks in advance for Low Price, then used an uprage bid for only 165 Euro outbound. DY departs from Terminal 5 so its most remote gates G and you are bussed to the plane. Load about 90% outbound and even more inbound. Premium cabin on the par with i.e. B777 ER Premium on Aeroflot, but no amenities. Drinks service fine, free cocktails and spirits, once in flight, tasty meal (however plastic with cutlery only) served; no midsized water bottles distributed - you may have either full sized one or as many refills as required. IFE system worked flawlessly, content a bit aged and no music selection, so BYO. Great legroom. Free earphones in Premium, regular jack. Orders per touchscreen and served in few minutes anytime. Inbound I missed the short upgrade bid frame, upon request at check-in and boarding the offered rate 400 USD wasn´t a deal. A meal order for 35 Euro isn´t worth as you may have full dinner with many choices around JFK for 35-40 USD. The legroom in Economy barely bearable for anyone over 6ft, very limited recline. Plane clean and quiet. USB chargers in both cabins, but no wi-fi like on their European routes. Return flight on time, but messed up by ground handling (Menzies) adding 25 mins for stairs and only two busses shifting. All in all, for 400 Eur return (Low Cost Economy/possibly 700 Eur in Premium on bids) it's hard to beat and no objection to board them again.

### "Seriously delayed"
New York JFK to Gatwick. Norwegian flight operated by Wamos. Seriously delayed. Poor service. No communication. Lack of food and no entertainment. Scheduled departure was 11:25 am, but actual departure was 10:55pm. An initial delay of 1 hour only became apparent when boarding of the plane should have commenced but didn't. We were told that the reason for the first delay was due to the late arrival of the flight crew. Other than this there was very limited information given to passengers by staff at the airport regarding updates of the new flight schedule. It was gradually set back several times, but each time there was never any communication to passengers at the airport, except when staff were pressured to do so by disgruntled passengers. An update on the airline website advised that meal vouchers would be provided. However, this was another thing that gate staff failed to announce. As a result, a significant number of passengers were not aware of their availability and missed out. During our additional 9 hour wait we were provided with a single meal voucher. There was no consideration given to the fact that we were travelling with a 4-month-old baby and that a meal voucher would not be suitable for her. We did not have sufficient formula feed to cover the added time, but when we queried this with the supervisor at the gate, she said there was nothing she could do about it and suggested we leave the airport to purchase some. We explained that we already had extra in our main suitcase, but she said it would be too difficult to try and locate the case as it was already loaded on to the plane. It was only when we argued that she had a duty of care for passenger welfare that she asked for our luggage to be located and brought to us, which indeed happened. After we eventually boarded the plane at 19:30, our experience continued to be less than satisfactory. Despite travelling with a small child and paying extra for a meal and seat reservation, we were allocated separate seats. It was only after another passenger agreed to swap, that we were able to sit together. We sat at the stand for 2 hours until the plane finally started taxiing. However, it was a further 90 minutes before we actually took off. During this time only a small cup of water was offered on a single occasion. While taxiing, it also became apparent that the crew were unable to properly manage the passengers. Despite being a direct flight between two English speaking countries, the Spanish crew spoke limited English, so struggled to understand a number of simple questions passengers asked them. The lengthy time spent taxiing also caused one passenger to need to use the toilet which one of the crew allowed them to do. This resulted in several other passengers asking to do the same but they were denied by another crew member, causing tensions to rise further. Also whilst the plane was moving several passengers remained standing despite the seatbelt light being illuminated, but at no time did any member of the crew instruct them to sit down. During the flight only water was offered, and there was no mention of food being provided. It was only when someone asked that they were told they could go to the back of the plane and get a sandwich, but they would not be bringing the trolley down the aisle. Once again no announcement was made about the availability of food, and it was only after word spread and more people went to the back of the plane that the crew decided to bring out the trolleys.

### "Very pleasantly surprised"
Paris to New York. Very pleasantly surprised by the experience I had with Norwegian. After reading reviews online I was hesitant to fly with them but it went without a hitch. Seat was comfortable and I had great legroom (though I had the wall in front of me). First meal was delicious and I got a glass of wine too (2nd meal was ok). Inflight entertainment was pretty good (watched 4 movies) and the operating system was clean and worked well. The plane was also clean and very modern. Only drawback was that the toilet was only on one side so as a result people used the space between my seat and the wall to go to the bathroom which was a bit uncomfortable for me. Would definitely fly with them again though!

### "Asked to upgrade our seats"
Rome to Newark. Website does not work to be able to check in bags or select seats. The staff on the phone refuses to help out. On the flight (operated by Privilege Style)  staff do not as much as ask if we would like water since we did not buy any meal plan. Asked to upgrade our seats to business for a fee and the staff person never got back to us until halfway through the long flight stating the “seats were broken in business class”.

### "Poor communication"
Gatwick to Helsinki. Horribly late, bad service at Norwegian desk (no availability to give phone calls, food or drinks but only 4 hours after original departing time). When flight finally left from Gatwick, the plane was very dirty, there was trash at both cabin and toilets. Captain was addressing his complaint for passengers because of "technical issues". Poor communication. Wifi did not work even it was advertised before.

### "all compensation was denied"
Not Verified |  Flight was late because of technical error (as told my sms), no help for food, drink or phone call was offered when I asked it from Airport desk. Aftterwards all compensation was denied. When airplane finally arrived, it was filthy and dirty. I understand, that I have to fly by Norwegian because I have not the funds for a proper company, but still it's sad that their service is so much below any line. I rate it "2", because I finally came home alive, of course 6 hours late. It wasn't first time, that's the whole point: they do it again and again.

### "it was a good experience"
Tenerife to Berlin. Flew Norwegian for the first time and overall it was a good experience. We paid 100€ each for the one way flight. Our fare included 2 pieces of luggage and seats in the exit row at no extra charge. Online checked in worked well, staff at the airport and onboard was friendly. Seats were comfortable and the legroom very nice. Flights were on time. They even had screens every three rows where they showed movies. Two things I didn‘t like: it was very freezing, our feet got cold and my mom got sick the next day. The WIFI on board didn‘t work, therefore we couldn‘t use the entertainment program. Would recommend them overall.

### "downgraded to economy class"
I booked our first flight with Norwegian flying out of Gatwick economy to JFK and returning in Premium. I paid for the flights and booked my seats online. The outbound leg passed without incident. The day before our return flight I received an SMS that informed me I had been downgraded to economy class. No reason was given, but the options were to accept a 75% refund and take the flight or a full refund to take an alternative flight. At such late notice return flight to the UK would have cost me a minimum of £3,500 so there was no choice. I called Norwegian Customer Services who offered no apology, explanation for the downgrade or alternatives and eventually hung up on me! There were no Norwegian  representatives at JFK (they hide behind telephone lines and the internet). Complaining to JFK ground staff also proved fruitless although they did give us access to the Lounge and promise us that we would still have the Premium Class meals and drinks. The flight was delayed for over 3 hours. Once we had boarded the plane we spoke to the first Norwegian representative we had seen and complained about our treatment. Again no apology was given although we were told that we had been downgraded because the return aircraft only had 36 Premium seats versus 53 seats in other Boeing 787. No reason was given as to how/why we had been selected for downgrade. Following take-off an FA brought us some blankets as way of recompense for the inconvenience. As meals and drinks were served we were told that we were not entitled to Premium meals/drinks as we would be receiving refunds. Not only was this contrary to what ground staff told us but also to the e-mail I had received from Norwegian informing me of our reassigned economy seats. To claim the refund I have to complete the claim online. I have also been informed by Norwegian customer services that this process can take 6-8 weeks because they have to "investigate" the claim and then write me a letter explaining the outcome before payment is made despite me pointing out that they must have all the information on their systems already! They also could not understand why I did not want the refund paid back to my credit card. This was the first time I have been downgraded. I would have expected Norwegian representatives to have bent over backwards to make our flight as comfortable as possible. Instead it seemed as if they wanted to rub salt into the wounds at every possible opportunity. I  will never fly this airline again. Norwegian may offer attractive fares but if they cannot deliver the service you’re paying a lot to receive an exceptionally poor service.

### "seats are uncomfortable"
Oakland to Copenhagen. The seats are uncomfortable. If you haven't paid a flexible/premium ticket or pre-purchased the meal option you don't get food. If you want to bring luggage of 20Kg you need to buy a flexible/premium ticket or pre-purchase luggage, otherwise you can bring only the small cabin luggage. You need to buy the headphones. If you arrive 50 minutes before departure, you risk that they will close the check in desk in front of you - check-in closes (including bag drop) 1 hour before departure

### "both flights delayed"
Newark to Rome operated by Privilege Style. No online check in, both flights delayed, no way to get through customer support on the phone, no updates. It was extremely hot in our part of the plane and I heard people complaining about being freezing in the other part of the plane. No entertainment, 9 hrs flight with the oldest and smallest screen in front of you, having the choice of only 2 shows.

### "flight was cancelled"
Boston to Gatwick. My flight was cancelled a few hours before departure, there was no help available, I was on the phone waiting for over an hour and didn’t get to speak to anyone, I was left stranded in Boston. I had no option but to book my return home with another airline. On my returned I contacted them to get a refund and claim for the extra money I paid to get home, nearly 2 and half weeks on I haven’t received my refund or any any compensation. They have never acknowledged my emails and don’t answer  phones. I will never travel long haul with them.

### "denied me compensation"
Orlando to Gatwick. Nearly 7 hours delay, night flight so I had booked Premium so I could get some sleep. My seat was broken and did not recline, was bolt upright the whole flight and was told to complain when I got home. They denied me compensation for both the delay and the broken seat.

### "offered excellent value"
Gatwick to Boston. Booked Norwegian over BA due to poor reviews of BA and we were not disappointed. Very good value from check in to landing in Boston with express access through immigration and lounge access all in the price. Cabin crew were very good and the food was also very good and well presented. Bearing in mind that BA and other airlines out of Heathrow cost three times as much Norwegian offered excellent value. The only minor complaint is that the plane had not been cleaned properly.

### "outdid themselves with poor service"
I foolishly gave them another chance after two prior disappointing attempts in the past five years. Each time I hope that they’ll be a little better. Admittedly I took a chance because they are because they are low cost. This time they outdid themselves with poor service. Address insult to incompetence, I asked, because it was my birthday if I was eligible for any amenity. This seems to have annoyed a fellow passenger and a particularly disturbed flight attendant. Bizarrely annoyed at my request the attendant spurred on by a couple passengers statement of annoyance said she didn’t like my attitude and continued to be rude at me for the entire flight. In the past it was late flights, poor service, indifferent customer support and flight attendant listlessness, but this time it was insane! Do not fly this airline, it is terrible and inconsiderate. Please pay a little more and fly with an airline that can be trusted.

### "shame and disappointment"
New York to Paris CDG. I was denied boarding because of overbooking for the cross Atlantic 11pm flight from JFK to Paris CDG. Norwegian did not offer another flight to get to destination within next 7 days! I was offered a flight to Copenhagen in 3 days. Minding I was in the line 3 hrs ahead of flight and was by far not the last one to check in. Tickets were purchased 6 months ahead. After long conversation with representative who made it clear that she's "doesn't have to help me at all". I managed to get a flight to London then to Stockholm and from there to Paris. It took 3 flights and 24 hours to get to destination! I was never compensated or refunded! Don't understand how Norwegian can be rated highly after this customer treatment. Shame and disappointment.

### "not suitable for long haul flights"
Not Verified |  Flew Norwegian from Edinburgh to New York. Service originally advertised as a wide bodied plane. Then changed to a 737. These planes are not suitable for long haul flights. We had a two hour delay on the runway at take off and a one hour delay at touchdown due to thunder and lightening meaning we spent a total of ten hours on a 737 with zero legroom. Inhuman conditions. Not impressed.

### "seating is comfy and spacious"
Not Verified |  This trip is only a short trip around 4 hrs from London to Tenerife. However the seating is comfy and spacious compared to some other airlines the price was reasonable considering. I like the fact the overhead compartments were angled and out of your way. Usually if you stand up on a plane the overhead compartments are right by the side of your head and makes the plane feel squashed. However on this plane it felt like there was a lot of room and height. The staff were friendly and efficient. They were very smiley but also professional. After flying on a number of different airlines the past couple of years this really does make a difference! So many flights attendants make you feel that if you ask for help, you are bothering them and it makes you feel awkward. However, I did not get that impression or feeling at all on this flight. They also have free WiFi and entertainment. This really added that extra comfort. After getting bored of watching TV programmes and my ears a little uncomfy from my headphones, to be able to just relax and browse the internet and message my sister who was sitting in another seat without having to shout across was brilliant. There are some free movies and tv programmes and others which you can pay for on the homepage aswell. It also has a flight tracker and temperature etc on the homepage. Overall would happily fly again with this company and will try to go with Norwegian in the future.

### "entertainment did not work"
Oakland to Barcelona. We book with Premium Flex seats with Norwegian Air on 787 aircraft who later notified us of both flight time changes and changes to Hi-Fly Aircraft A340. These are older and smaller planes that were not well maintained. The entertainment system did not work at all. The air re circulation was poor and the seats were downgraded to economy. Definitely the worst flying experience ever and we have flown on some old prop planes in the past. HiFly is a cheap and low quality substitute for airlines that need to replace their existing planes for whatever reason. In this case the 787 all need engine overhauls. Bottom line is to avoid Hi-Fly if at all possible. We would have rebooked with another airline, even if it cost more, to avoid that experience. And shame on Norwegian for taking no responsibility for any of that.

### "pleasure to work with"
Fort Lauderdale to London. Love Norwegian! With the Dreamliner you definitely arrive feeling "normal" vs regular planes due to the cabin pressure. Premium Economy has tons of room, good food, and great service! The staff was incredibly friendly. Our flight was actually delayed over 5 hours which caused us to miss our connection. However they gave us plenty of notice, so we were able to book another connection. I had purchased the flight insurance and they reimbursed us for the cost of the new flight, since it was over a 5 hour delay. What a pleasure to work with! Will fly them any time I can!

### "no response to date"
Once on the plane everything is quite adequate. The flight crew was professional and courteous. I take issue with what happened prior to the flight. I purchased Premium Flex tickets on Feb. 24, 2018 at 3:55 p.m. in the amount of $8959.20, for 4 round trip, nonstop tickets from LAX to Rome (June 23, 2018) and nonstop tickets returning from Rome to LAX on July 8, 2018. On May 7, 2018, we received notification that both our flights to and from Rome had been cancelled. It seemed unusual that both flights would be cancelled. I called and talked with one of the booking agents, who booked 4 seats on a nonstop flight to Rome from LAX on June 22nd and a return flight on July 8 that went from Rome to Oslo and from Oslo to LAX. He informed me that there were no Premium Flex seats available on the return flight and booked us in the economy section. I requested that I be reimbursed the cost of the premium flex seats and was informed he had made the change in flights without charging me, and therefore I was not going to be reimbursed. I explained to him that the change was forced upon us because Norwegian had cancelled our previous flights. I also explained that our premium flex tickets allowed for a free change. He told me I would have to email Norwegian. When he sent me confirmation of these two flights via email, the flight from LAX to Rome stated "Seats not reserved. The flight confirmation from Rome to Oslo and from Oslo to LAX indicated specific seats. When I asked about this he told me that he could see the seat numbers on the flight from LAX to Rome on his computer and that they should show up shortly. The seat numbers were never sent. I had to rearrange our itinerary which cost both time and money, since we had already paid for the rest of the vacation in advance through our travel agent. On the eve of our flight, I once again called Norwegian customer service and asked what our seat numbers would be for the flight from LAX to Rome. I was told that we would receive them when we arrived at the airport. I asked why we had seat numbers for both return flights, but not for our flight originating from LAX. He said he couldn't access this information. When we arrived at LAX, we were informed that the flight was overbooked and that there was only one seat in the premium flex section. (We arrived 3 hours early) and waited for the ticket counter to open. My husband took that seat and my adult children and I sat in the economy section. The agent at the Norwegian counter at LAX was very apologetic and told us that we would be reimbursed 75% of the cost of the tickets. I asked her for a written receipt of this and she said that she could not do this. She explained that I would have to contact Norwegian directly. On our return flight from Rome to LAX I again talked with the agent at the counter and explained the situation and she also told us that we would be reimbursed 75% of our tickets. Again, I was informed that I would need to contact Norwegian directly. Received a reference number on-line. It has been almost a month and no response to date.

### "the flight was oversold"
I showed up at the airport with a Premium Flex booking to be told at the check in the flight was oversold and told that it happens, nothing we can do other than provide a seat in economy or find another flight with another airline. Had we been informed earlier we may have had the opportunity to choose another airline but no advance notice was provided. In fact a confirmation email was sent 24 hours prior stating check in airport. It has now been over 3 weeks & no correspondence about my refund they stated I would receive after filing a claim. Tried to call numerous times with a machine stating abnormal waiting times.

### "wait 2 hours for food"
New York JFK to Oslo. Horrible experience at JFK. 2 hours of waiting in bag drop line and chaotic boarding. Flight delayed because plane wasn't cleaned on time, so another hour of queuing with little communication. Eventually, departure after midnight instead of 23:30. Had to wait 2 hours for food to be delivered onboard, so the meal was served at 2am - and no chance to have dinner earlier. So better bring your own food if you happen to travel with them.

### "35 minutes before departure"
Roma to Bergen via Oslo. I arrived to check in 35 minutes before departure, and staff prevented me to proceed (check in closes 45 mins before departure). Nobody offered me a discount for another ticket and were not helpful. There were no direct flights to Bergen the same day. I had to take a new transit one the next day, after paying extra 450 euros.

### "staff service was really good"
Stockholm to Bordeaux return in economy class. The flight was over all very enjoyable and relaxing except a few small details. The value for money for this flight was in fact really good! To fly with Norwegian was a little bit more expensive than the other airlines flying down to Bordeaux, although all other flights were non direct flights and the overall experience was slightly better than other flights on similar routes. So overall the extra expense is worth it for the service and comfort you receive. The ground service was okay but a bit slower than usual. The seat comfort was quite good. There was a fair amount of legroom and the seat was quite comfortable except that there was a slight ridge at the very back of the seat that stuck up slightly, and that was a bit irritating and uncomfortable but I got used to it after a while. The cabin staff service was really good. All staff members where very polite and nice and the service was very rapid. The food and beverages on board was very good. I had a tapas mix and it was actually quite enjoyable. I usually never like airline food but this was exceptionally good! On a final note I was very surprised by how good the on board wifi service. It was easy to connect to. I just connected to the wifi network "Norwegian internet access" and then opened my browser and clicked go online. The download speed was much better than other airlines like qatar airways for example. The wifi was very good for being aboard an airplane. I would really recommend you to fly with Norwegian if your flying between destinations in Europe.

### "not a good experience"
I have flown Norwegian USA to Uk many times, but recently the quality has gone down. I just got of the flight from Gatwick to Oakland. The flight is over 11 hrs, and the entertainment and food/drink ordering system was down. It appeared no attempt was made to fix it other than a half hearted attempt to reset it. Requests for a blanket were ignored, food was pretty bad considering we were flying premium, no better than the average economy meals. Overall not a good experience and I doubt I will fly Norwegian again, and certainly not into Oakland, which must rank as one of the worst USA airports.

### "avoid this airline at all cost"
Newburgh to Dublin. I wanted to try Norwegian, because I heard good things from friends that flew home to Ireland with their family, and they liked them. After booking the flights and seeing what the packages were, we decided to choose the lowfare plus that included meals, baggage and WiFi for the trip. The cost of the trip was very reasonable for our family to travel back home. On the day of the trip, we left Rochester NY at 4:30am to drive to Newburgh NY for a 12:25 flight departure. An hour into the drive, I got an email saying the flight was delayed by 2 hours. My first thought was oh no, the rental car...which we booked through Norwegian’s Website. So I called customer service number, to get a call center out in India or Pakistan, with an agent who didn’t speak very good English, tell me that there is nothing he could do. From there, I felt this was going to be a nightmare trip. I got to the airport unloaded the baggage and parked the car and we made our way to the check in desk. I got there to a rude Woman working the Check in desk. I asked her how come the flight was delayed, while chewing gum with her mouth open said the it left Dublin late. I said ok, and went through check in. Just as we were done she then shouted at my wife and said all bags needed to be weighed, all bags. I said why are you shouting? She just rolled her eyes and said nothing. We never flew with this airline before and didn’t know what or if personal items needed to be weighed in. From there we weighed everything but it felt like it was an inconvenience for her to put a yellow cabin sticker on the personal items and for her to do her job. Just before went through security I called Norwegian again, to find out what was going to be done about the delay and the rental car? I spoke with another man and again I was told there was nothing he could do but file a complaint and a claim online. I explained that I was traveling with two young boys and we wouldn’t get into Dublin until after 1 A.M. in the morning. The latest the rental company would stay open until was 1 A.M., again, nothing we can do. From there we went through security and then was meant to board at 1:35 for a 2:25 flight. Didn’t board until 2:05 or so. We got to our seats and spoke to the flight attendant, lovely guy. He asked us how are day was going and we told him. He was shocked by everything. He then informed us that the flight was going to take longer because we had to go over Greenland and we would get in about 2:30am. Ugggh! Then we asked the WiFi code or password - he said no WiFi on this flight which showed WiFi when we booked. So, two young kids, 7hr 45 min flight with nothing for the kids - interesting! Captain came over the speaker and apologized for the heat saying the air conditioning wasn’t working either. So flight delayed, 3 hours. Didn’t take off until after 3pm. Rental car company closed at 1am. No air conditioning. Rude check in, no WiFi, and no help from Norwegian. Nice! Avoid this airline at all cost. Should have spent the extra $2000 and flew with Aer Lingus! 1/10 Norwegian. Filed a claim online and contacted customer service and nothing yet.

### "did not reimburse us"
We were suppose to leave on July 10th and got notice on July 6th that they had cancelled our flight and moved it back a day. The airline did not reimburse us the money we lost from our airbnb. The flight was not comfortable and the food was not good.

### "a great airline"
Gatwick to Barcelona. Absolutely brilliant and a great airline! Good customer care, brilliant check in system, lots of help at the airport! Took good care of the suitcases, the crew were polite and very approachable. Well done Norwegian airline for making our travels great

### "pay for anything extra"
Amsterdam to New York. I was not allowed to check in and print the boarding pass before arrival to airport or at the airport kiosk. Despite traveling light with carry on only, had to wait for one hour in a check in line. At the boarding time a very long line of people not moving for very long time. You pay for anything extra : blanket, water, meal, luggage. The good things are that the cabin is nice, enough toilets, and there are screens for on board entertainment. I will try to avoid Norwegian, not worth it.

### "had changed to Wamos Air"
My 16yr old granddaughter and I flew back from New York as part of an Iglu QM2 cruise package. booked 10 months previously.As stated on the Norwegian website, we expected the plane to be a Boeing 78 , but on receiving our flight tickets a month before departure, this had changed to Wamos Air. The plane must have been the first 747 ever to take to the skies. Our low fare plus tickets included checked in and hand luggage, seat reservation and nice and tasty meal. Our allocated seats were 9A and 9B before an emergency exit. There was no leg room in front of 9A, meaning I could only sit with one leg crossed over the other. The seats were less comfortable than a park bench and didn't recline. Seat 9C was occupied by a lady in her 60's and I am in my 70's. None of us 3 were able bodied enough to deal with an emergency evacuation. There were a few well built males  6ft ish but not fat) in the cabin who had to squeeze themselves into their seats. There were no aircraft magazines, food/drinks menus, no drinks or flight accessories, blankets trolleys or any form of entertainment whatsoever. The 'Nice and Tasty Meal' was served about 2 hours before landing in a paper bag and contained a bottle of apple juice, and a long refrigerated cheese and ham roll and small muffin, which were cold, dry and inedible. Many passengers boarded with oversize hand baggage, which couldn't have been weight checked, taking up whole overhead compartments and making it almost impossible to close the doors. More than a dozen other bags, including ours, had to be crammed into the crew's storage cupboard. Apart from serving the paper bags, this appeared to be the only 2 occasions when any crew were in attendance. The flight fulfilled not one of the expectations of a Norwegian flight and if this was their first flight for any of the passengers, they will surely never set foot on a plane again.

### "the flight was great"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Denver. I travelled with my 2 children and the flight was great. The airplane was clean and the Leg room was good. There were plenty of toilets and the staff were attentive and food excellent.

### "a good flight"
Los Angeles to Stockholm. Pretty decent for a airline with such a bad reputation. I had around 5kg overweight which would’ve cost me around 75$ but the lady let me go. The aircraft itself was clean and made a lot less noise than other aircrafts I've flown with which is a huge plus since I’m scared of flying. Even though I had forgotten to apply that I wanted a vegetarian meal they still offered me a delicious one. Overall a good flight, only issue I had was that the seats kept going back after you had reclined them.

### "legroom very limited"
I go to Norway every two years to see family and friends, so I was delighted to learn about the international service a couple of years ago. I flew Norwegian 2 July, and return OSL-JFK on 13 July this year, my second trip with them. While there's still an element of cool and style about this brand, the passenger experience aligns more with the values and customer service of a low-cost airline. First, the seats. They look worn, and they're very close together. Pitch is minimal, so legroom very limited. Once the seat in front of you reclines (only about 4 or 5 cm) it's nearly impossible to use the tray table. I noted that on my flight ex JFK that my seatbelt was very dirty. I paid more to sit in the second-last row, in 35A. Even then, the design of the seats in front meant that it was very uncomfortable to take advantage of the extra legroom. The staff is present during service sectors of the flight, and they are polite and know their jobs very well. What surprised me this trip was that the crew seemed entirely American, with the exception of the flight deck. Also, there were no announcements in the Norwegian language. That was surprising. The food is typical economy fare (though you pay extra for it). The meal I had on the way back wasn't at all terrible in terms of quality, but it's presented in a paper box/puzzle thing, that gets warm and falls apart almost immediately. A tray for the meal wouldn't hurt, and it's sustainable. My verdict is that ticket prices certainly don't make this a low-cost experience, or even a charter airline experience. On many charter companies all pax get a meal, for example. A round-trip, which I bought too late as I had to sort out commitments, was $1400US. I bought it in May, for a July trip. That's not cheap, so while I can say that I had a beautiful time in Oslo and Sunnmøre I'll perhaps switch to a European legacy carrier for trips home in future. Book, this airline, though, if you're looking for a direct way to get to Oslo from the east coast of the United States. Try to choose a good seat, and eat and rest before you fly. This service has grown very quickly, and I think there has to be a strategy for taking the brand into the future.

### "didn’t compensate for my monetary loss"
The worst experience of traveling ever: They canceled my flight on the same day of departure I had to buy a very expensive last minute ticket with another airline because the very unresponsive customer service told me the next Norwegian flight available would have been leaving in 15 days! They didn’t compensate for my monetary loss. On the return flight the ruined my luggage and they wouldn’t compensate. On an 11 hrs flight from Paris to Los Angeles they don’t even offer water to people that don’t buy their very expensive and unappetizing lunch Avoid this airlin .

### "refunded the cost of flight"
We had planned a trip to London back in August 2017 and booked a premium Economy seat with another couple for June 6, 2018. On the morning we were due to fly , we got a text saying we were downgraded to economy. When questioned, we were told a different plane with fewer premium seats was flying and we would be compensated. Not an hour later we get a second text saying flight cancelled due to technical issues. We scrambled to contact airline and remained on hold for over an hour, to then be told a “Hotline” was to be set up and next available flight June 13th. No offer to rebook. Called hotline (not toll free and in Foreign language ) again on hold several times for over an hour. Tried main line again and on hold then call disconnected. Never able to contact anyone to assist us in making alternate flight plans. Ended up having to rebook on alternate airline for an extra $5200. Our trip had been all arranged and cannot change to a week later! Very poor customer service. Was refunded the cost of flight.

### "delayed then cancelled"
Madrid to Malta. The flight was first delayed by 4 hours then cancelled because they had no crew. We arrived to the hotel at 2 a.m., we were woken up early to have breakfast and go back to the airport only to inform us that perhaps the flight will be at midnight. No staff were available to talk to but only agents who knew little English. All announcements were made in Spanish only and we had difficult time finding someone who could understand Spanish and translate to English for us. I am still in Madrid, hoping to arrive home after 48 hours if lucky.

### "by far is the worst airline ever"
We were informed three weeks prior to our scheduled trip that Norwegian would not be operating our flight. It was changed to Euro Atlantic. This was going to be an older aircraft with fewer amenities. With only three weeks prior to our trip it was going to be too expensive to change to another airline therefore, reluctantly we decided to still fly with Norwegian. Our flight to Rome was uneventful. No issues. On the flight from Paris to New York when we arrived at the airport, we received a text message 2 hours before scheduled departure that the flight had been canceled. We discovered from other passengers that this was the second day in a row this flight had been canceled. There was no one at the Norwegian customer service desk to help nor could you get a Norwegian representative on the phone. We eventually had to purchase a ticket with another airline the next day for double the amount of our ticket with Norwegian. We have filed an online claim for our refund and three weeks later we have not received any type of response on the status of our claim. This by far is the worst airline ever!

### "cancelled without notice or explanation"
The flight was cancelled without notice or explanation. Numerous passengers arrived at the airport and were told to wait in a line. After an hour, we were told that the line was for hotels only, and no refunds, rerouting etc. would be done - in fact, no Norwegian personnel were present, and the desk labelled "Norwegian" was staffed by airport personnel who did not work for Norwegian. A text indicated we should call a number, in Norway, that disconnected repeatedly after one ring. I, and the other customers, called a US 800 number that we had to look up. After over an hour on hold, the agent said he would refund the ticket. Full stop. I could rebook on another airline, which he would not assist in, or he would look for a Norwegian flight, the next one, 24 hours ahead, was full already.

### "incredibly pleasant surprise"
Buenos Aires to Stockholm via London Gatwick. What an incredibly pleasant surprise! Complete trip was EZE LGW ARN LGW EZE. Except for the LGW ARN LGW sectors in economy the long distance flights were in their Premium cabin. Prior to boarding at Buenos Aires flight was delayed two hours due to industrial action (aka strike) by airport workers. We were given a voucher for a full hot meal! Onboard cabin crew were excellent. Soon after take off a full bar trolley came by with a wide choice of soft and alcoholic drinks. Lunch was then served with more drinks which were available with sandwiches throughout the 12+hour flight. Good IFE movies, no music. Cabin crew coming through permanently with drinks. On the return flight from LGW fast and smiling checkin, priority security lane and business lounge. Same pleasant, competent and efficient cabin crew. On the LGW ARN LGW sectors in a B737-8, flights on time, easy checkin and boarding, pleasant crew, food and drink for sale. Seats in the premium cabin were comfortable enough, wide, reclining and good footrest. Only negative comment on the long flights is that all announcements, including safety, etc. were only in English despite a majority of non english speaking passengers. Pre-recorded announcements would have sufficed. Overall, excellent value for money.

### "I can't book another day"
I have booked a ticket for Corfu, which apparently is not refundable, or at least that's what the customer service said, even if you call them up a month prior to departure. The dates for direct flights for my destination (Greece) even during the summer are very few, so unfortunately I can't book another day that is convenient to me that would not require me to spend 15 hours at some Oslo airport. Therefore, I would recommend to use this company only for their main flight routes, i.e. Norway flights, and try some other one for different routes that actually have an adequate flight schedule.

### "without any basic amenities"
The airline told us that they did not have an aircraft for our flight. After a one hour delay they told us they were putting us on a Malaysian Airlines aircraft. We had the option of either complying or getting a refund without any compensation for the fact that we would then need to pay extremely inflated same-day ticket prices or stay in a hotel until the next available flight. Malaysian Airlines aircraft was very very old without any basic amenities for a standard international flight and with no in-flight entertainment for an 8 hour flight. I will never fly with Norwegian again!

### "definitely fly Premium again"
New York JFK to Bergen via Oslo. We couldn't beat the price for a one way ticket from NYC-JFK to Bergen, Norway connection in Oslo. Upgrading to Premium was a no-brainer, for a slight fee you get lounge access (Alitalia) not great but something, a meal and a pre-arrival snack, complimentary cocktails, reclining seat and additional space. Definitely worth it. We had also booked a one-way ticket from Gatwick to JFK, but two weeks before received notification that we had been moved from a Norwegian flight to an airline called Wamos, with the option of a full refund if we wanted to cancel, which we did (and re-booked on Virgin Atlantic). Terminal 1 was absolute mayhem as all Europe bound flights on many international airlines departed around the same time (including 2 A380's!). Our flight boarded on time and departed slightly delayed at 11.35 pm. Dinner was served after takeoff with two options. The food is served in a box and cutlery and "glassware" were plastic but was very tasty. While you are given a blanket you are not given a pillow, which I found odd, and there is no amenity kit. IFE offered a lot but it was so late we just went to sleep and actually got a few hours of good sleep. An hour prior to arrival we were served a snack. If connecting to another flight you have to collect your bags and recheck them. Problem was our bags didn't arrive - never left NY. Fortunately we were going to be in Bergen (pre-cruise) for 2 days. After very good communication from Norwegian our bags showed up the following day. We were very happy with the way the airline handled getting us our luggage and will definitely fly Premium again. Highly recommended.

### "our flight is canceled"
New York to Oslo. My flight was originally at 11 pm on Thursday. They notified us extremely late that our flight is canceled. At the airport, we were going to rebook but they assured us that our flight would leave the next day at 3:30 PM and that everyone would be automatically rebooked, so we went home and hoped for the best. The next day we found out that the 3:30 flight was canceled (only through a website, they did not notify us directly). We went to the airport in hopes of getting another flight, just to found that it was false. I arrived three days later.

### "conversed in Portuguese"
Los Angeles to Paris. We were booked on a Boeing 787 but were then told it would be an Airbus, which was then overbooked. Our reserved seats side by side were changed to 2 in different rows which we only found out at the airport. The Airbus did not have an airline name on it; it can’t have been Norwegian since they boast of only having Boeing 787's. The flight personnel wore no identifying uniforms and conversed in Portuguese and were rude and inefficient whilst in-flight entertainment was minimal - not ideal for a 10 hour flight - far inferior to that of the Boeing 787. I have made my concerns known to Norwegian Customer Services, asking for explanations. After four weeks I have had nothing back from them other than a confirmation that they received my complaint. I maintain that their lack of service and reaction gives the lie to their boasts about customer satisfaction.

### "find a downgrade to economy"
Gatwick to Orlando returning from Boston in Premium cabin as part of a big birthday celebration. The out journey was very good but the return was the worst I have encountered. Problems started at check in with staff refusing to answer questions on why we had been moved from seats 1A/1B to row 7. I asked repeatedly if there were any issues but was told no. We arrived at the aircraft turned left to find a downgrade to economy, despite holding a premium ticket. The cabin staff said not their fault and called ground staff who told us to sit or get off and if we did not move quick they would get police to forcibly remove us. 4 weeks later and no reply from Norwegian, no refund (as per EU Law) and 10 hours to their call center only to have the call cut by staff after waiting more than an hour each time.

### "it still offers good value"
Chicago to Gatwick. Leg room in premium is better than all others I’ve flown. Mainly virgin and BA. Service could be called no frills, but, I actually found it quite refreshing. The meals are good quality and a good selection of drinks are available. The meal comes in a box so you don’t feel like you’re trapped as I usually do once the table cloths come out in other premium services. Seats are not quite as comfortable as virgin, but, I still easily slept due to a very good recline. Screens were great and there was a good although limited selection of movies. You can use your own 3.5mm headphone jack and a usb if needed. Goes without saying, the flight on 787 is less tiring than all others. The bits I didn’t like Chicago airport is terrible. Constant delays, crowded, poor selection of restaurants. No lounge available at Chicago. 20 dollar voucher instead which was pretty poor. Premium seat baggage did not seem to get any priority. Overall, it still offers good value.

### "waiting for a day and a half"
My flight was originally at 11 pm on Thursday. They notified us extremely late that our flight is canceled. They said this was out of their control and people that booked with travel agents got notified, but some people that did didn’t get notified. When we called to rebook, they put us on hold for a long time and then hung up. When pressing the option to rebook, they hung up on us. At the airport, we were going to rebook but they assured us that our flight would leave the next day at 3:30 PM and that everyone would be automatically rebooked, so we went back home and hoped for the best. The next day we found out that the 3:30 flight was canceled (only through a website, they did not notify us directly). We went to the airport in hopes of getting another flight. When we came they assured us that our flight would be that day at 11 PM and that the airplane was on its way. (Turns out the airplane didn’t  leave London) Although we were pessimistic, we stayed, again hoping for the best. At around 6 Pm we found out that they had lied to us. Most likely to keep us relatively calm, they had told us that we would be guaranteed spots on the 11 PM flight but as we found out, there was no space for us and they knew that all along. They kept us waiting almost a whole day for something they knew would not happen. The manager was hiding in his office, except for the time that he assured all of us that we are guaranteed a spot on the flight, while the airline brings random workers that don’t even work for them to come and answer the frantic people’s questions. Anyway, they are now trying to rebook around 450 people onto a delta flight the next day at 9 PM, in the middle of this after only getting through around 5 people, they left, saying that they don’t have the authority to book us with another airline. They have come back but nothing is happening. We have now been waiting for a day and a half, and it will become more than two days. We are losing all of our time in London, we will only be there for about half a day. We have lost a lot of money, starting with our air BNB bills and our flight, etc. We don’t even know if we’re making it anywhere and if we will even go on vacation. We have gone back and forth 4 or 5 times. This is my first and last time taking Norwegian airlines. Never again am I putting myself through such stress.

### "delayed by 4 hours"
Fort Lauderdale to Copenhagen. I am flying Norwegian for the first time that is also going to me my last. I booked my tickets 2 months prior to departure. They changed the departure time 8 times since booked. The day of flight, we were told we would be delayed by 4 hours. They are taking my award of the worst airlines, worse than Spirit even.

### "do not offer complimentary drinks"
Newark to Paris Orly operated by EuroAtlantic Airways. Norwegian is the worst airline I have flown. They nickel and dime you for everything and do not offer complimentary drinks, we had to practically beg for a cup of still water. The seat was uncomfortable, legroom was limited, there was no entertainment or internet, and our reading lamp did not work. The flight attendants were charmless and unhelpful. When we arrived in Paris-Orly, we had to wait 2 full hours to retrieve our bags. Our flight back was similarly miserable, when we arrived in Newark, we had to wait over two hours to disembark.

### "It was a great flight"
I flew Norwegian from Gatwick to Singapore. It was a great flight as I scored three seats to myself so I could sleep most of the flight. The plane was a Boeing 787-9 and it was very comfortable. The flight was 12.5 hours and I was able to rest for most of the time. I did not buy any refreshments as I bought my own water. I did watch a movie or two on the IFE system. Seats were comfortable. I will fly Norwegian again as they are one of my choices for a low cost carrier.

### "wait a long time for luggage"
Oakland to Barcelona. The seat had good leg room. The cabin was too hot waiting for take off. Not all of the entertainment systems were  working. No announcements re food, entertainment systems tablet replacements, etc. When we landed in Oakland had to wait a long time for luggage handlers to deliver. Before flying I tried calling for seat assignment. I asked for exit row both going and returning. Turns out I did not get exit row coming or going from BCN. Some of the ticket machines in Oakland to print boarding passes did not work.

### "was the worst flight"
Boston to Gatwick. Flight was delayed 2.5 hours because the incoming flight was delayed. The airport agents were late opening up, were not helpful or friendly, and very unprofessional. The airport screens said they open at 5pm and they were there, but just chilling out and chatting. They finally opened at 5:30. And then the same group showed up at the gate, still chilling out, chatting, and checking their cellphones. And announcing delays. They finally offered meal $10 meal vouchers as required by EU law 5 minutes before they started boarding without telling us where we could use them. By then it was 11pm and the food places were either closed or out of food. I had selected seats online when I purchased the tickets, but the seating chart didn't match the actual aircraft so we ended up in the front row by the cabin door; no under-seat storage, and next to the galley. I would not have chosen these seats with an accurate seating chart. The flight attendants offered no help in storing our carry-on and didn't let us know that carry-ons only had to be stored during takeoff and landing. Our 9:30pm flight took off at midnight and about 12:30am they offered dinner. My wife used her jacket as a blanket and was told when we were about to land to "either put it on, or store it. This was the worst flight we've been on.

### "my flight was overbooked "
Providence to Dublin. I was two hours before flight time to check in and was told that my flight was overbooked 18 seats and I cannot fly out. Spent four and half hour till midnight waiting and trying to rebook by different persons at the counter. It's just a mess. Norwegian is a small airline. That means there is no accepted flight for several days. Don't count on Morwegian will buy you ticket from other available airline. I was refused to board and I missed my booked 7-days european group tour.

### "never is on time"
The flight from Madrid to London, leaving Madrid on a Monday evening at 18.15 is never on time. I have taken this flight several times in the last year and can honestly say it never is on time and I am not talking about 30 minutes or an hour, usually it is 1-2 hours. On my last flight we were more than 4 hours delayed, the reason given were technical problems, whatever this might mean. I started flying with Norwegian probably 2 years ago and was really pleased with them. Not only the price but also the service. I have to say that especially in the last year, they have developed into one of the worst airlines, for many reasons, but especially on this route.

### "zero communication"
My Norwegian flight on June 16 from Paris to NYC was cancelled. The attendants at the gate informed us it was due to mechanical issues however the real fact was that the cancellation was due to airline employee strikes which is an activity Parisians are highly skilled in. Two more flights the next day on Norwegian to NYC were canceled as well from the same issue. I don’t blame the airline for the cancelled flight or the Parisians poor work habits at the airport, however the communication or should I say zero communication is what should be called out. They had one attendant to handle the situation and all information was passed along to other passenger’s amongst the passengers. No announcement over the loud speaker or anything. The single attendant who did not speak English just stood behind the ticket counter at the exit area in baggage claim and simply froze. He had no clue what to do. A passenger on the airline that spoke French and English met with him and stood on the baggage gate carrier and informed the passengers on the next steps. This passenger took control over the airlines dysfunction. The pasenger/airline spokesperson informed us we all had rooms waiting for us at a hotel 45 minutes away and they would take us to the hotel by 3 busses, which they did. I was on the second bus and when we pulled up to the hotel we informed there were no rooms left. The bus driver who appeared clueless and was only interested in a smoking break informed us if we left the bus they could no longer help us which was a good enough reason to leave the bus. I grabbed my luggage and walked to a nearby hotel and booked a room myself I received a text from the airline that a hotline was set up for this flight to rebook but then received another text that the hotline had crashed. I was able to get through to Norwegian the next day and get a flight the following day.

### "Worst airline experience"
Norwegian staff in Orly, Paris airport lied to our plane members multiple times regarding a canceled flight. They sent us an hour outside of Paris by bus to a hotel and told us a bus would pick us up for our flight but when we got there, the hotel staff said "they booked you a room for tonight and have you leaving tomorrow" after we had slept in the airport overnight. They refused to give us passengers any food when we hadn't eaten in 24 hours and slept in what looked like a refugee campsite with mini cots. Worst airline experience I've ever had. Norwegian, you treat people with no respect and very inhumanely.

### "it's a reasonable airline"
Not Verified |  Okay for holidays, but unreliable if you need to be on time for a connecting flight, or for business. Obviously, leave a couple of hours between connecting flights I flew Gatwick to New York. The flight from London to New York was delayed by a bit over 2 hours meaning I couldn't make a connecting flight, lost over £1000 in the flights I was hoping to connect to. In defense of Norwegian they did offer more compensation than they were required to under European Union rules, a free rebook was offered, they could have said tough as it's under 3-hour delay you get nothing. For holidays it's a reasonable airline, But if you're making connecting flights they are too risky to use, due to their small fleet.

### "nowhere to put my legs"
The negatives of travelling business and not being able to choose your flight. Thanks to my booking including food I was lucky enough to sample the food that was woeful, small and came with two drinks throughout a 10 hour flight. Were you opting for this flight because you wanted to save money then you receive nothing onboard unless you pay for it. I’m 6’2” and had nowhere to put my legs, the seats were leather or faux leather and the cabin incredibly warm,  a blanket or pillow is extra. At least the crew were welcoming and competent, unless you wanted some sort of service. The woman in front was in economy but apparently paid for premium and didn’t get a meal, a drink or the cabin she paid for. It wasn’t until she kicked off she managed to get food and drink. The 150 hours of online entertainment was about as good as virgin used to be in 2008.

### "my bag was too large"
Norwegian do not serve any complimentary water or food/snacks on this  flight. The flight began with me having to pay 70 pounds because my bag was too large. The woman at the check-in desk said my backpack would not fit even though it met the weight and dimension requirements and had been accepted on the first flight. Once on board, I found the overhead bins to be extremely large and most of them were empty.

### "was cancelled 10 days prior"
I booked a flight for my family of 5: 2 children under 5, two adults, and a senior citizen for a direct flight from Boston to Paris Charles De Gaulle (flight time ~6-7 hours). We paid extra for this particular flight only to learn it was cancelled 10 days prior to departure for an inspection. After 2+ hours on hold we were given a flight from Boston to Newark on United and then to Paris Orly on Norwegian. This flight totaled approximately 13 hours including layover but it was the only option they had for us arriving the same day. We arrived in Newark and waited in an hour and a half security line with two young kids at 11:00pm. We arrived at the terminal where were informed the flight was delayed for technical issues. Shortly after the announcement the gate staff disbanded and it was over 40 minutes later they abruptly announced the flight was cancelled and directed us to the baggage area. By now it was past 1am. Interestingly enough all of the gate staff that had left were down at the ticket counter so clearly they knew the flight was going to be cancelled up to an hour before letting their customers know. We retrieved our baggage and then had to wait in a line with hundreds of people for hotel vouchers. We arrived at the hotel at 3am and were told the flight was delayed until 7am. At 7am the flight was delayed until noon. At noon the flight was delayed until 1pm. During this time I waited on hold for Norwegian customer service for cumulatively for 5 hours. At 11 am a Norwegian phone rep said the flight would be cancelled and transferred me to the “rebooking hotline”. At 12:20pm the rebooking hotline picked up and promptly told me there was nothing she could do, as the flight was still ‘delayed’, and was going to put me back through to customer service. When asked how that would help she said “I don’t know”. I asked if she could help me come up with an alternative flight arrangement in the event the flight was cancelled and she said “no”. I travel frequently for business and pleasure - domestically and internationally- and I cannot remember a time an airline demonstrated the level of unprofessionalism, lack of compassion, and  disregard for the schedules of their passengers. We are traveling for a family reunion and to meet a new addition to our family and Norwegian has now twice stopped this trip with very little in the way of compassion. When asked about reparations the say to file a claim online and they will get back to you in 4-6 weeks -this further demonstrates their service culture. My hold time on the phone is now up to 7 hours cumulatively - there is no excuse for this.

### "very uncomfortable"
Newark to Rome. The seats are so tight and very uncomfortable. On our return flight we were passed by on the food and drinks. They weren’t going to give us water until we informed them that we were premium passengers. The flight attendant insisted we were not on her list which was embarrassing for us. When she finally brought our food (reluctantly) it wasn’t fit for us. This airline is cheap in every aspect.

### "terrible customer service"
New York JFK to Milan via Copenhagen. We used Norwegian as our choice of airline. The airfare didn't seem so bad at first, $1,800.00 round trip. But then there is the cost of the luggage, since we had a layover in Denmark, we had to pay the luggage cost from NYC to Denmark, and then from Denmark to Italy. They charge not only for luggage but also for water, yes water, on a over 8 hour long trip they didn't have the courtesy to provide the customers with water. They also charge for blankets, food, snacks, everything. The sits in the airplane are very uncomfortable and they don't recline not even 1/2 inch. They crank up the AC in the airplane so if you don't have a sweatshirt you'd have to buy their blankets, otherwise you'd freeze. On our way back from Italy, we left from Malpensa airport. Our flight was supposed to leave at 13:50 on June 8th. The first bad sign about this whole experience with Norwegian was that there was not any Norwegian presence at the airport. We arrived the night before the flight at the airport and looked around and saw absolutely no Norwegian presence anywhere, not a sign or desk. I had to check by travel documents to make sure I was at the right airport. There was an airport strike and 99% of the flights were cancelled. But, of course our flight wasn't, in fact the flight left 2 hours earlier and my wife and I and quite a few other passengers weren't informed. No announcements, no emails, no texts. I called their customer service in the US and got a busy signal. I then called the Denmark customer service and because I was calling from Italy from my US phone, the signal was terrible and they couldn't understand me, at least that's what they told me, but I heard them loud and clear, they didn't want to bother with my problem. I called them a second time and the customer service heard me, but after a few seconds put me on hold and hung up. I called the US customer service and finally got a hold of someone, who did not care or helped me. She said I had to find someone in the airport to help me. After a while my nice manner with this customer service representative worn off and I gave her a piece of my mind about Norwegian airlines. Needless to say I got ripped off by an airline company that only care about taking advantage of customers with bait and switch tactics, terrible service, terrible customer service. In my mind for some reason I thought that European service/customer service would be a lot better then any other part of the world, but right now, its the worse possible. Norwegian did not refund my flight and I had to book a flight back from Malpensa to NYC and the only airline available that would fly that day was Emirates and for last minute booking for $1,200.00 for two people direct flight was fantastic. I think all airlines should look at how Emirates takes care of their customers and learn from them. They are an amazing airline.

### "disconnected from reality"
After sitting at Edinburgh for several hours, Norwegian canceled our flight an hour before the airport closed down. Not a single Norwegian staffer ever got on the intercom to update passengers at any point. All communication was done via Swissport staff. Hotel accommodation was made for us at a nearby Holiday Inn, but new flights could only be done via Norwegian directly. Phone line we were on hold for over 3 hours including US and UK numbers. Never was a single human from the company able to speak with us on any digital media or real-life vocal platform. This is as disconnected from reality as possible.

### "no premium class"
Los Angeles to Paris. We booked Premium Flex seats. When we loaded plane were put on a HiFly airline fight, which is a Portuguese airlines. They had no premium class. No one was told about the change. We paid for their premium class and was put on a plane that dinner trays didn’t even work. They had tape holding seats together. They still never said anything to any of the passangers. We had the same problem flying out of Milan. Our flight was canceled without any booking options. Total fraud. Do not fly Norwegian

### "is a low cost airline"
This is a low cost airline and their Premium Economy is low cost even if you end paying as much as a airline. I originally booked a RT ticket from LAX to CDG and CDG to LAX. However, I had to cancel at the last minute my LAX-CDG portion as they switched their aircraft from their new Boeing 787 to a leased A340 from HiFly with apparently no or little in flight entertainment and very old seats. Fortunately the CDG-LAX portion was still operated by a Boeing 787 from Norwegian but I was still disappointed. Weight limit for check in luggage is 2x20 kg. Agent at Paris check in counter wasn't particularly friendly. The lounge at CDG is very basic with some soda, white and red wine and snacks such as chips and cheese. Boarding was disorganized but they did board Premium passengers first. After boarding they offered a preflight drink of water or orange juice. Seats are old style business class recliners, quite comfortable with decent leg room. They only provide you a slim blanket but no pillow or amenity kits. Soon after we took off they offered drinks but no snacks. Then they served the main meal which comes in a box and looks like a regular economy meal. No snack was offered during the flight. You can supposedly order drinks (including alcoholic drinks) free during the flight from your IFE system but beverages including coke and sprite were out of stock. IFE offers about 40 movies but remains quite limited.

### "No customer support"
2Gatwick to Gothenburg. Flight was cancelled. No customer support at Gatwick, we had to move around the airport several times without any useful information, and no one from Norwegian to deal with the cancellation. The Norwegian Web interface is full of bugs, and the view is not consistent with the iOS app. Consistently generates these technical errors without major explanation, and it gives a phone number in Norway. Customer Relations are not helpful, more on the rude side.

### "I would use Norwegian again"
Gatwick to Orlando. We flew out in economy class to Orlando then returned from Denver. The plane was superb modern, clean, smooth and comfortable, flight was on time and staff were friendly, price was good too. However what let this airline down mainly was the food, it was appalling - meat and fish tough, choices of menu were odd to say the least, especially for the children. I thought this would improve in premium economy class but I believe the options were identical. Additionally the viewing choices were very limited in terms of movies and were the same coming back. On my return premium flight there were two toilets at the front of the plane in my cabin, for some reason the staff sequestered one of the toilets  for their own use and even then still sometimes used the only other available toilet, is this normal? All in all I would use Norwegian again but feel let down in the premium experience, I expected more.

### "arrived over 2 hours late"
Prague to Oslo. Anytime I fly with Norwegian the flight is delayed. The customer service is not helpful and they do not provide any compensation for transport. Yesterday I arrived to Oslo over 2 hours late, which would not be an issue, if I would not arrive in the time of no public transport service.

### "how good the flight was"
Helsinki to Rovaniemi. I was surprised how good the flight was. The onboard entertainment was very good. There was almost always a short film playing. The bathrooms were clean. The flight was on time and the staff we're kind. Only bad thing I can think of is that the seats were kind of uncomfortable.

### "They made me pay for my bag"
Venice to New York via Copenhagen. Flight got cancelled, they did not pay for overnight stay, made flight out from Pisa the day after. They made me pay for my bag to New York as I had no prepaid luggage and unless pre-ordered and paid for, they make you pay for food - and they lost my bag. Has been 3 days and still did not receive it.

### "My flight was canceled"
My flight from Boston to Gatwick was canceled. I lost connecting flight, because airline failed to place me in London before Tuesday, and the cancelled flight was on Friday. - there were no available flights for 5 days. I ended up canceling my hotels, my trip, everything. Their customer service is just so poor. There was no communication to me. I only found out about flight cancellation when I got to the airport. I had to spend hours on the phone first trying to rebook and then cancelling the trip. I understand its a cheap airline, but save your money and book with a reputable airline. My cancelled trip ended up costing me more

### "happy with their customer service"
Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale. We were actually booked on the August flight, but there was a change to the (non-refundable) flight times. Norwegian refunded my tickets in full, even the return leg, which was only slightly affected. I would have no hesitation to book with them again, especially as there are some new and exciting destinations being added - very happy with their customer service.

### "tiniest toasted sandwich"
Gatwick to Madrid. Economy class seat pitch quite tight but comfortable enough for short haul. Flight packed so slightly uncomfortable. Crew mostly Spanish and mostly not very welcoming unless you were Spanish - they appeared to get more attention. I bought a toasted ham and cheese sandwich as it looked pleasant in the menu photo. What I received was a tiniest toasted sandwich I have seen and very burnt. I pointed out how burnt it was too the steward and he told me it is the last one! I was in row 6 and they had just started service. So I kept it. I then noticed he was servicing the passenger on the isle seat who ordered the same and - yes - miraculously a perfectly toasted ham and cheese sandwich materialised! So not happy with the way crew were treating me. Flight arrived pretty much on time. And the WiFi was not working.

### "the 787 was not flying"
New York JFK to Gatwick. I was supposed to be flying on the Boeing 787 and booked premium economy. One month before my flight I was sent a text saying that the 787 was not flying on that particular day I could therefore either cancel, change my date or leave as is. I contacted and changed my date to a day earlier. I was assured that this would be on a 787 plane. On arrival at the plane (an A330 leased in from HiFly), the premium seats were torn, my aisle seat had been changed to a middle seat. My overhead locker was stuck down with duct tape, the seats did not recline and I was unable to watch the antiquated movies (choice of 5) because there were no headphones. The staff barely spoke English and just shrugged. I booked an extra night in a hotel and paid for an additional days car hire in order to fly on the Boeing 787 only to spend 7.5 hours staring at the seat in front of me. There was no wifi on board. When the food arrived I opened the table, only for it to collapse. An attempt to complain to Norwegian was met with put it in an email and we will get back to you in 6-8 weeks time. when I asked to speak to someone higher I was disconnected. I  will now go back to Virgin and pay the extra to at least know what I am getting.

### "I asked for water 3 times"
Gatwick to Singapore. The seats seem roomier, they have a nice movie selection but I had never received such bad treatment by disgruntled flight attendants. I have flown with Norwegian in short 2 hour flights and everything okay, but I saw a number of people who were unaware that they were not going to receive any meals or drinks free. Flight attendants ignore you if you didn't book meals. I asked for water 3 times and only the first time they brought me a half-filled tiny cup of water, the other 2 times the FA never brought anything. Luckily, I brought a tiny bottle of juice, less than 200 ml but it saved me from dehydrating, same with the wrap I bought before entering the plane. I ordered a small bottle of Albanian wine and a baguette on their interactive monitor and the FA brought the wine which was as described but the baguette was a small bun for $7 USD. She didn't give me time to complain but I'm going to fight the charges on my credit card since this was different to what was on the picture.

### "did not realise I had to pre-order"
Paris to Fort Lauderdale. I felt left out during service because I did not realise I had to pre-order a meal for a 10 hour flight, did order a snack, which was not good. Not a hello nor a goodbye when boarding/unboarding the aircraft.

### "it was overbooked"
I reached Singapore airport for my flight to London in Apreil 2018 and was told that I would not be allowed on the flight as it was overbooked, despite my booking it 6 months ago. I was told I would have to call Norwegian from the airport to rearrange the flight myself as there were no employees from the airline at the airport available to speak to. I was on hold for so long that it cost me £50 just to rearrange my own flight. After making a claim after arriving in London I was told I would not be refunded this money, and not once was there an attempt to help me out or apologise. I was stranded and received no assistance from the airline, despite it being their mistake. I will certainly never fly with them again

### "it was a good deal"
I flew Norwegian in economy from Paris to Oakland and then upgraded myself for the way back. I was pretty happy with the outbound flight as I paid a very small price for an 11h flight. I booked the cheapest fare so I only had a carry on, could not choose my seat and had to buy food at the airport but I still I was happy with my choice: seat was okay and legroom was more than decent. I was disappointed with the return flight in premium economy. Premium line at Oakland was a joke, so was priority boarding. Lounge access was nice but the one in OAK is so small it was crowded when I arrived. About the actual flight, my seat was very nice and large but the staff was unprofessional. Moreover, no vegetarian option and premium meal below the quality of what you could find on Air France or Lufthansa economy menu. Taking into account the low price I paid for it I still think it was a good deal but I won't upgrade next time, it's not worth it!

### "Stewart to Edinburgh"
Stewart to Edinburgh in economy. The check in staff was very helpful moving people through first who were on the Dublin flight which was leaving first. The check in agent asked me to put all my carry items on the scale and it came in at 9.8 kilos just under the limit. Waiting was very pleasant as it is a very small airport and you cannot get lost. When I boarded the plane I found someone in my seat so I asked whether I could sit in another seat which I had spotted. After a check was made, I was able to sit in the new seat and not have to split up a family. The flight was uneventful and I was able to get three hours sleep. Boarding cards were handed out on the plane for non EU people. At the gate we boarded transport to get to the terminal(see pic). Norwegian is my favorite low cost carrier.

### "no responses to communications"
Flew Los Angeles to Rome and then Venice to Los Angeles via Stockholm . Every flight was late at least an hour. There was a 90-minute scheduled layover in ARN and, with the VCE-ARN taking off 85 minutes late, we nearly missed the connection, which would have required us to spend an extra day, at least, traveling. Fortunately, they held the ARN-LAX flight for the 32 of us that had that connection. Unfortunately, our bags didn't make the flight. Dealing with the Norwegian customer service, social media and baggage service in LAX was not pleasant. I received no responses to my communications (email, voicemail, social media). They do not answer their baggage services phone line during their purported business hours. I left a voicemail and haven't received a call back. They provided one meal and one snack on the long-haul flights. No refills on water or sodas (more generous on coffee and tea). Seats were standard and overhead bins were adequate. Flight crew were not the most welcoming, but polite.

### "No compensation was given"
Gatwick to Los Angeles, the flight arrived 1hr 47 mins late, forcing me to miss my next flight I had booked. No compensation or reconciliation was given. Will not fly this airline again but the brownie given with the meal was exceptional and the dimming windows are neat.

### "wonderful flight experience"
Providence to Shannon. It was my first flight to Ireland with Norwegian last week and it was the best experience ever. Cabin seating extremely comfortable. The cabin crew service was impeccable along with delicious meals and drinks. The flights were on time. It was a true pleasure experience to fly with them and it won't be my last. A wonderful flight experience.

### "probably fly with them again,"
Copenhagen to Los Angeles. $45  meal ripoff: The 3-course meal consisted of salad (very small portion with olive oil for dressing), the main meal (I had the beef which was ok) plus a drink (had a beer), and for dessert a very small brownie which one was supposed to wash down with coffee. I was still hungry. The meal was given in a box that opens in two halves. Ihad TV dinners for $2.95 that filled me up more. There is a snack 1-2 hours before the end of the flight which was just a sandwich, a brownie and coffee (regular size). For $45 I expected more. But one more bad experience: they skipped over me while serving the lunch boxes. Since not every passenger ordered the meal online, they used a list printout with the seat nbr and name (I suppose), so an oversight by the flight attendant can happen and is forgivable. When I made the attendant aware of it, she demanded I show my boarding pass and putting the onus of proof on me as though I tried to cheat the airline out of a meal. That said, I would probably fly with them again, but bring my own sandwiches.

### "everything was pretty good"
New York to Berlin with a stop at Oslo. In general everything was pretty good. Crew was friendly and helpful. I bought the tickets with a purpose of choosing the seats that I chose using the plane's plan provided by the website, I chose same seats from NY to Oslo as well as from Oslo to New York. It as row 23, when my family was going to Oslo it was nice the exact spots I chose, but on our way back the same number row appeared to be before the bathrooms. You can imagine all my trip it was an eight-hour flight people were right above my head with slamming doors that was horrible, however we chose the seats in the middle like it was showing on the plan. Ii it fair? There were people in my row 23 with no seat choice or food included I paid for food and seats that way I give a 10/10 for my flight from NY to Oslo and 2 from Oslo to New York. My family and I are upset with such a way of treating customers.

### "charge for literally everything"
. As a low-cost airline Norwegian charge for literally everything. Seat reservation on the LowFare is $35, 10kg is your combined carry on and personal bag allowance. You don’t get a free meal, you have to pre-order and pay for it. You don’t even get a drink (soda, juice or coffee) or snacks if you don’t pay. If you need a blanket, pillow or ear buds you need to pay. They don’t even offer water. I asked for it when the flight attendant skipped me and she handed me a plastic cup. When they were going around with a coffee, I asked for it (knowing that for Nespresso coffee you have to pay but this was a regular coffee) and the flight attendant looked at my airport-bought sandwich on the tray and asked if I purchased a meal on the flight. When I answered No, she said you have to pay for coffee. When I arrived to the JFK two hours before my flight I saw the longest ever check-in line. They changed the gates just before boarding. I’m writing this is because they charged me $100 for 0.5kg more in my carry-on / personal item. Cabin baggage must be below 10kg so everything you have with you has to be 10kg or less. They don’t even give you receipt for that but instead they stamp your boarding pass with ‘paid’.

### "they declined my claim"
Chicago to Gatwick. I had a terrible experience with Norwegian, even after I paid for the upgrade to premium. At the airport, I was told there was no dinner service, so was given a voucher for use at the airport, which was decent. However, they also ran out of food for breakfast so I never got that. In addition, the plane landed over four hours late with no apology or explanation. When I filed a claim for compensation, they stated the plane only landed three hours 41 minutes late and that the circumstances were “extraordinary” so they declined my claim.

### "Wifi did not work"
Flight was okay, everything is do by your self at check in. No service during flights under 60 minutes. Expensive to buy checked in bags. Wifi did not work.

### "both flights were cancelled"
I made a reservation in March for Los Angeles to Milan to travel in June 2018. I found out via email that both flights were cancelled. I called Norwegian. Could not reach them until later evening. They said everything looked fine. Flights are a go etc. I said, Are you sure? I got and email saying they were cancelled. So the guy dug deeper and called me back. Sure enough both flights cancelled and he said that I could rebook but Milan to LAX routes are cancelled. I had to fly out of Oakland, not LAX andit was subject to availability. Lucky I called that same day or what would have happened?I am leaving two days earlier now to Rome. Cost to me: two more hotel days, not good rates as 3 months ago, and 3 days of food etc. No Milan. Canceled a hotel there for no refund as it was reserved months ago. Also I am eating non refundable tickets in and out of LAX from Oakland. Apparently I have no rights. I asked about an upgrade at least. No.

### "overbooked the premium seats"
I bought premium tickets several months in advance, however, I was placed on standby and downgraded to coach before getting into the plane given that Norwegian overbooked the premium seats. I was told by the staff that there is nothing they could do to help, I should contact the airline by phone to request a refund. The refund is not automatic, if you try to use the website and email you don’t get response. It is difficult to get someone to answer the phone and when they do they claim it would take 4-6 weeks to evaluate the case. The whole thing is really outrageous, disappointing, one of the worst experiences with an airline I have had.

### "no idea what is happening"
Los Angeles to Milan. I booked my flight 3 months in advance for July 2018 and a month before my trip I get an email saying my flights have been cancelled. Trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, I called Customer Service to get some questions answered and understand my options. I have been on hold for 2.5 hours and have yet to speak to someone. The great part of it all is after 2.5 hours they ended the call. I waited all that time to be disconnected. Needless to say I have no idea what is happening with my flight or if I will even get my money back. ]

### "my bag was lost"
Chicago to Copenhagen via Gatwick. Until I got to my final destination  I thought Norwegian was great, except for the fact that they canceled my original flight and would've left me stranded in London had I not noticed. They were kind enough to fix their mistake and switch my flight from Chicago to London so I'd make my layover on time. When I got to Copenhagen, my bag did not arrive on the belt. I know that these things happen sometimes. The issue comes in with what happened after my bag was lost; customer service at the airport could not have been more rude or disrespectful toward me! It's now been over a month and my bag is still missing. The airline is doing little to nothing to try to find my bag. I filled out a form but had one sheet of paper missing so now my compensation is in jeopardy.

### "Friendly, efficient cabin staff"
Easy trip from home to Stewart International, NY. Check in and boarding was a breeze. Friendly, efficient cabin staff. Flight left early. Could improve food/snack purchase options. I had pre paid for a meal but was still hungry. Using a credit card for a $3 snack was weird. The daytime flight is great. Landed in Dublin at 11pm.

### "Really a pleasure"
Seattle to Gatwick. Just want to said a big thank you to this amazing flight with this company. Really a pleasure for a price of €220. The cabin crew was amazing. I reserved a seat 4 days earlier and I received my ticket on my phone, I’ve checked in, in the airport with no problems and no queue.

### "would avoid booking at all costs"
Norwegian on two separate occasions have changed my flights for my upcoming flights from London Gatwick to New York JFK. The limited option choices were fly with someone else, fly out later (missing arranged plans) and fly out earlier (at additional personal expense). They did not seem to have genuine care about the inconvenience they have caused without giving an explanation why the changes occurred. As a rewards member I thought they would hope to make some sort of effort to accommodate me but my response was very much a sense of ‘well these things happen and we can’t help’, not really the answer I wanted. After a few messages back and forth they confirmed they weren’t interested in keeping my business or future business. I would avoid booking at all costs.

### "not be paying for luggage"
Gatwick to New York JFK. We booked our tickets in December and serveral times the flight times were changed. Our flight was supposed to be at 7:45am on Monday April 16th. We decided to travel up to Gatwick on the Sunday evening and stay in a nearby hotel. On our drive up I had a text from Norwegian saying “sorry for the cancellation of your flight.” If I’m honest, due to all of the schedule changes I was not shocked by this cancellation. The text was sent to me 13 hours before we were due to depart. I called Norwegian and all they could offer was a flight going out the day after our original booking. As we only had 3 days in New York this was not good enough. We asked for a refund of our tickets and had to book tickets with a different airline, which cost us around £400 extra per person. Our return flight was on Thursday the 19th of April at 11:25am. My friend was checking the live flight updates and saw that our flight was delayed by 7 hours. Good job she checked because Norwegian decided not to notify me! Got to airport, checked in and had our cabin bags weighed and the lady working said we’d be charged for our luggage as my friend was slightly over in weight. I’m not one to lose my cool and get angry at staff, but after a cancelled flight and then a 7 hour delay, I definitely would not be paying for luggage. Still waiting for the refund from my tickets for our flight on the 16th of April. Had an email to confirm I’d receive the refund within a week, however there’s no sign of it.

### "middle seat in the middle aisle"
Los Angeles to Rome. Placed a bid for upgrade to the premium cabin that was not accepted however when getting on plane seats in the premium cabin were available. When we mentioned that we had bid to upgrade and we were interested in upgrading to the premium cabin we were told that it would be $400 each. We explained our bid to the stewardess and were told to contact Norwegian and they would likely pay us back the difference. Unfortunately we (in two different rows) received the middle seat in the middle aisle. With the people in front of us reclining their chairs it was nearly impossible to get out our seats to go to the bathroom or to walk a bit on a 12 hour flight. Horrible seating arrangement in the center aisle for a premium seat. The woman seated next to me unfortunately spilled her entire glass of red wine on me early in the flight. When we both notified the attendants of the situation there seemed to be absolutely no urgency to address my dilemma. Instead I sat there for over five minutes as the red wine soaked into my clothing before alerting another attendant of the situation. Finally I received a dinner napkin to absorb the full glass of wine on me. We communicated with their head office multiple times while we were in Europe for over three weeks. We finally received a communication back close to two months after our flight notifying us basically that we could go pack sand.

### "plane that was delayed"
Barcelona to Los Angeles. Our flight was due to arrive in LAX at 9:15 pm. We arrived at the gate at two minutes after midnight. The plane that we took was delayed getting to Barcelona. Food service consisted of a tiny chicken dinner with a salad and a mini muffin with no other entree choice and a later light snack of a sandwich.

### "rude and unhelpful"
Oslo to Helsinki. Our flight was cancelled due to technical issues and a mandatory staff break. We were traveling with a rather large group and Norwegian left us waiting for information about our flight for almost two hours. The staff was incredibly rude and unhelpful, and we got no apology what so ever. We were supposed to be in Helsinki late on Sunday, and we got booked for a flight on Monday at 7 o'clock - almost 24 hours later than scheduled. After almost two hour of waiting for customer service, we got an unfriendly welcome and a flight that would land at 16.00 in Helsinki and a pathetic 15€ food compensation. A small portion of our group, that travelled with hand luggage only got promised a ticket to Sweden, and were promised a hotel and a flight early in the morning. When they got to Arlanda no hotel was given. They slept at the airport. This is a horrible experience and we will never fly with Norwegian again. Written at the airport after 15 hours of absolutely horrible service from Norwegian.

### "I asked for a refund"
I flew from NY (JFK) to Paris (ORLY) and they changed the airport of departure and the associated time of departure and arrival two times: from JFK to Newark some weeks after booking the flight and from Newark to JFK five hours before the departure and from CDG (original arrival airport) to Orly, where I had a connection flight to Venice. I was already heading to Newark airport when I received a message saying that I had to go to JFK. The expected departure time was already delayed by a few hours, compared to the departure time from Newark. But the delay and the change of airport weren’t enough already and the flight departed with 5 hours 42 minutes of delay (after 2 am). We didn’t receive any sorts of information during the time we spent waiting, the flight disappeared also from the airport screens for a few hours and nobody was able to tell us anything. We didn't even receive the care it is mentioned on the website in case of delay: "What you’re entitled to: Right to care If you’re involuntarily denied boarding, or your flight is cancelled or significantly delayed (as outlined above), you’ll be entitled to: meals and refreshments vouchers in reasonable relation to the waiting time, provided it won’t further delay departure of the flight, two telephone calls, telex or fax messages or e-mails". I was lucky enough that I didn’t additional 35€ for the meal on board, because they had no meals available for the people who paid the meal in advance. I missed my connection flight from Paris to Venice and I had to pay a new flight at a higher price and I arrived in Venice 8 hours after the supposed arrival time. I asked for a refund for the new flight I was forced to take, and compensation for the more than 5 hours delay. First, it took more than one month to answer, what they replied is that they deny responsibility for the delay and for the continuous change of airport of arrival and departure. The only refund I can have is a ridiculous amount of 21.80€, which is the price of the public transport from Orly to Charles de Gaulle.

### "fabulous as always"
Gran Canaria to Barcelona. Fabulous as always. I just love Norwegian. Super puntual. The lady at the checkin desk even offered me to register a 3rd luggage or suitcase for free. I had two big luggages, one was definitely heavier than the other but they took the total weight. Checkin super fast and efficient. And very friendly staff. Plane left spot on very puntual. Nice comfortable seats even for a fairly tall person. Each time I fly Norwegian, each time I am happy. Way better than their Spanish or Irish competition.

### "weigh hand luggage and backpack"
I was flying to Oslo from JFK on a Sunday night, the airport was super crowded due to the snowstorm on March 21, flights were postponed until Sunday. I tried to do a self-check-in on one of the machines near the counter check-in area, it was unsuccessful so I had to wait in line to get my tickets printed from the counter. I asked staff if she could weigh my hand luggage to see if it was over 9kg, which I was 98% certain that it wasn't and was asked to weigh my backpack as well and the total was 13 kg. She told me I had to pay $65. No airline has asked me to weigh my hand luggage and backpack together. As a low cost airline you have to pay for water, food or snack and a blanket.

### "no sense of organization"
This was a shockingly poor experience. Was ticketed EWR-BCN and was originating at ORD. Had checked in at ORD and received a text message from Norwegian saying that the flight was rerouted and will depart from JFK for 'regualtory' reasons. This was a first for me in many years of traveling. Not wanting to take the two hour cab ride from EWR to JFK at rush hour, I rerouted domestically to LGA, and of course got separated form my bags, despite assurances they would make it. Got down to JFK T1 to discover massive queues and confusion at Norwegian check in. They had rerouted several flights that night from EWR and there must have been 1000 people checking in for their flights. Long security queues as well as there are several other carriers flying to Asia that time of night. No restaurants open in T1 at this hour, and Norwegian lounge access in the Alitalia lounge was more like a city public bus terminal, there were people sprawled all over, beer cans, food wrappers, dirty plates all over. Complete chaos at the gate with no sense of organization. No Norwegian employees anywhere in sight. Left two hours late. Pilot explained it was weather that caused the rerouting of the flight, but a simple check of flight status at EWR showed no other flights rerouted to JFK - only Norwegian. I found this airline to be awful. There was no response to my complaint, no apology for what happened that night.

### "it was very comfortable"
On 19th April I flew Norwegian from Copenhagen to Los Angeles. It was a great flight as I scored three seats to myself so I could sleep most of the flight. The plane was a 787-9 and it was very comfortable. What I appreciated most was the blue tinted windows as the sun was streaming into the window and it was very hot. The flight was 11 hours and I was able to watch three movies for free. There were minimal service announcements during the flight so we could rest. I will fly Norwegian again as they are one of my choices for a low cost carrier. The only problem encountered was I had to do a manual check in as their system had no place for a green card.

### "Boeing 787 seemed cramped"
In 2017 we were on the first scheduled Norwegian flight from Los Angeles to Barcelona. It was quite exciting for everyone including the cabin crew. So, I chose them again for our trip this year to Barcelona, and we were disappointed. The boarding process was tiring and chaotic resulting in a late departure. The cabin crew, while efficient, were not particularly friendly. We went through a zone of heavy turbulence with no communication from the flight crew as to the expected severity or duration. The Boeing 787 seemed cramped compared with the seating on our return flight on Level A330. As on our first flight, sandwiches and other menu items were sold out when we most needed them. There was no wifi on.

### "Customer service an alien concept"
New York to Gatwick. Summoned to the airport but told the flight was delayed by 1 hour on 16 April. Actually the incoming was cancelled due to “technical issues” so our flight was never going to leave late or anytime. 100 of the passengers were offered a transfer to Newark for an overnight flight to Barcelona with the promise of onward to London. And the remaining passengers? Extreme caution advised. Customer service an alien concept at Norwegian.

### "Last minute cancellation"
Worst Airline ever. Last minute cancellation, no communication, took us 4 hours to reach a representative to rebook, finally rebooked us on another airline and when we reached the airport, we were told Norwegian had overbooked the other airline. Waiting on stand by until boarding. Luckily we did get a place on the aircraft. Return flight also cancelled 45 min before departure. We were rechecked on another fight with a detour through Iceland. Reached JFK with a delay of about 5 hours, only to find out that our bags were left in Gatwick. They didn't even offer water to passengers after delaying them for over 4 hours. Inhuman and lousy representatives. Never ever going to fly this airline again. When offering refund on a flight, they will only offer you refund for one way. They expect you to fly back on a return trip even when they cancel the flight. Like you are supposed to magically fly back when you dont even make it there.

### "totally unprofessional"
We upgraded to premium class for our return flight from Chicago to London and had confirmed seats. We were told when we checked in at the airport that there had been a plane change and there were not enough seats in premium so that we would have to fly in coach. To add insult, they would not refund our money for the upgrade and said we would need to apply for a refund online after our flight. Its been a week and we still have not received a response or a refund, totally unprofessional! My experience and feedback would have been completely different had they of honored our upgrade. Norwegian has tremendous potential but they need a deeper bench for resolving disputes, beware.

### Norwegian customer review
Our flight to London was cancelled less than 24 hours before it was scheduled to depart. We were invited to reschedule on their web site, which couldn't function. Phone calls went unanswered for 30 minutes. We finally got on a much less desirable flight leaving at 1:30 am. A few hours before departure, we were told it was delayed to 3:30 am. At the airport we were given meal vouchers. Our return flight was also cancelled; we had to reschedule for 6:05 am the following day. A few hours before the flight, we were informed that it was delayed until 1:30 pm. At the airport they told us it would be leaving at 2 pm, boarding at 12:40. Information boards said the gate would be assigned at 2:40 pm, even though departure was shown as 2 pm. At 1:30 pm, we heard an announcement that the flight was boarding. We rushed to the gate and were told it was too late to go to the bathroom or buy any food. Overall a miserable experience, with poor communication from the airline at every turn.

### "leave customers deeply disappointed"
What can I say I received an email yesterday asking for volunteers to cancel this flight and receive a refund and 200 euros, when you have planned something for a special birthday and paid for a hotel is that really something you’d want to receive or consider! I’ve now got to spend the majority of my birthday at the airport because of the incompetence of Norwegian. Don’t sell us a service you cannot then provide us with, you leave customers deeply disappointed. Your offers of complimentary food doesn’t make up for the 8+ hours of our holiday we will now miss out on. It’s so poor. This wasn’t cheap we paid out a lot of money. Also Norwegian changed the carrier to hifly and now I’ve just seen there is no information re our flight until 15.00 pm and initially the flight was supposed to be at 6.10am. How can you treat customers like this?

### "Incredible value for money"
Gatwick to Oakland. Incredible value for money. It was the first time I flew long haul with Norwegian and it was a very pleasant surprise. The Boeing 787 is a great and very comfortable aircraft, with perfect lighting and comfortable seats. I managed to secure a return flight (and direct) for £300 which is  incredible. Of course the food and the checked luggage is not included but you can order via the screen in front of you in a fraction of seconds. I would really recommend this "low cost" airline and will definitely fly Norwegian again.

### "customer service is shocking"
This is the most disorganised airline I've ever booked with. I've had 2 cancelled flights within 10 days, so disappointing as it was my 40th birthday treat. I have now had to ask for a full refund and use a different airline as I have no trust in them. Their customer service is shocking, I've had no apology, no understanding and it's cost me £120 in phone bills calling their "hotline" which I intend to claim from The airline. My advise would be to not even consider booking with them.

### "great value for our money"
Los Angeles to Paris CDG. We have taken many long flights over the years, and this was one of the most comfortable and enjoyable ones yet. When we booked, we were not given a choice, but were assigned seats in row 8. My husband and I were seated together, but our friends (booked at the same time) were seated on either side of us. This was easily corrected once on the plane. Our flight included the meal. Not great, but certainly welcome, The morning meal consisted of a sandwich, small cinnamon roll and juice. Again, not wonderful, but adequate. The staff was responsive and accommodating. The entertainment choices were outstanding. We brought our own earphones/headsets, but or friends had not and were unable to partake of much of the entertainment. The plane itself was far more comfortable than most we've flown. These were very inexpensive tickets, so we felt we got great value for our money.

### "experience was extremely stressful"
I do not recommend Norwegian at all. My flight from Orlando to Paris got delayed 3 times (total of 39 hours). My vacation got cut 2 days short! Not only that but the staff were not very nice and it took them until 11pm to find us a hotel to stay in for 2 nights. However, they did pay for all the food and the hotel. This whole experience was extremely stressful.

### "such a rude, inconsiderate company"
I got to Gatwick 1 hour 20 min before my flight. Typically this time is not a problem since I had no checked luggage and was flying to my home country. I tried to check in at the kiosks but they weren’t working so I was told to stand in line. I was waiting for over ten minutes in a long line then told an employee that my flight was leaving in an hour. They told me that check in just closed, even thought it was 1 hour 5 min before my flight. I asked if they could reopen since I was there in line before the hour and they refused. I asked to speak to a manager and they said they couldn’t help me and I needed to buy a new ticket. I talked to several people who were extremely rude and unwilling to help. I fly from London to the States several times a year and have never had this happen. I have never dealt with such a rude, inconsiderate company in my life.

### "might switch me again"
New York to Paris. 4 hours before my flight I get a message that my flight is canceled and I will be on the next flight which is tomorrow. The next day I show up and waiting for their check in to open, I get another message that my flight is delayed for 4 hours. Waiting around I get another message it’s delayed for another hour. This is ridiculous at this point. My seats can’t be confirmed. I’m still not even sure if I’m going to be on the the aircraft they say I’m going to be on. They might switch me again.

### "my suitcase was damaged"
Last trip from Madrid to Reykjavik my suitcase was damaged. I know how difficult it is that a low cost airline pays for a damaged suitcase so I went directly to the check-in desk of Norwegian on Reykjavik airport. There I showed the damaged suitcase to an employee asking where could I make a formal complain. She told me that they don't have customer service desk at Reykjavik airport and that I could only complain via internet. So the day after I sent an email explaining everything. Some mails after they offered a compensation of just 50 euros (instead of the 220 euros my suitcase cost). The reason? I didn't complain at Reykjavik airport but via internet. Exactly: I just did what they told me to do. Be careful if you have any damaged suitcase, I think the strategy is to tell the customers to complain via internet so that they will only pay you 50 euros. It's a shame how low cost airlines try to trick the customer. I thought Norwegian were more serious. If I can avoid flying with them again I will do it, no doubt. If you get a damaged suitcase with them, complain at the airport.

### "an unnecessary and stressful start"
Given that we have an Indian passport and a valid US visa we are entitled to a visa on arrival at Dubai airport. Unfortunately Norwegian staffers were unaware of this and would not listen to our reasoning. This meant a 1 hour argument with first ground staff and then the customer service at Oslo. We were finally allowed to check in but this was only thanks to an Emirates staffer calling them and confirming the regulation. This was an unnecessary and stressful start to a holiday that could have been avoided.

### "6 hour delay in Newark"
Newark to Rome via Oslo. 6 hour delay in Newark with little notification other than update in 30 minutes. Then was too late to make other plans. Was told I would fly to Oslo first to get me to Rome, stated it would be a quick turnaround to switch planes and crews. Now will be in Rome at 3AM after a 4 hour wait for another plane and crew. All of this is forgiveable when one gets proper notice so that plans can be made. Without such notice, I am dropped of in a foreign city at 3 AM without the ability to get my rental car or drive to my destination.

### "Flight quite normal"
Copenhagen to Helsinki. Flight quite normal. They said that the flight was express flight which had some restrictions in service procedures. According to their onboard magazine it was not in definition of express flight. Only announcements from cockpit were in Swedish. All other announcements in English and Finnish. Norwegian should lso consider to use Swedish especially on flights to Finland, after all it's also the second official language of Finland.

### "No apology was issued"
Norwegian has left me and my child stranded in Rome for 5 days! I’ve spent 5 hours trying to get a flight back to any New York Airport! They are also not willing to guarantee our hotel and food costs. The outbound flight was scheduled for 12am but was suddenly rerouted from Newark to at 2.30 am in the morning. No apology was issued only a mention that meal service was cancelled. Don’t bother calling the airline, they don’t pick up for hours and then disconnect after promising to connect the passenger with their “help Line”. This is a chaotic, mismanaged airline that has no interest in customer service!

### "2 kg over and forced to pay"
My  flight from Gatwick to JFK ran very smoothly. The service was quick and amenable at both the airport and on board. I cannot say the same for my return from JFK. The lady at the desk arbitrarily chose people to hold accountable to the carry on weight limit - the man before me had a a backpack and carry on suitcase and went through smoothly. I had a handbag and suitcase of a lesser size, and was made to weigh them together. Combined I was 2 kg over, and was forced to pay 65 USD to check my luggage. I was then rushed out, not having time to switch my toiletries to my now-checked luggage. From what I could see after me, the random baggage fee was assigned to others as well, while some got through perfectly fine. This inconsistency does nothing to foster trust between customers, and I will next time avoid flying Norwegian as I do not know what standard I will be held accountable to.

### "I'm not won over"
Buenos Aires to Gatwick. Following up on my recent review of economy class, Gatwick to Buenos Aires. I never recived a reply to my request for an aisle seat for the return leg so unable to face the misery of economy class for the return I put in a bid for an upgrade. I bid lower than they suggested and I'm pleased to say got the upgrade although not the seats I had reserved. Im not wholly sure why I cant rave as others have. My view is that I paid for a more spacious ride and nothing more. Space was good compared to cramped out back but I found the vinyl seat covering hard to sit on for 12 hours. When passenger in front reclines its a hard job negotiating getting in / out of your seat especially for the window or middle 2-3-2 configuration. The premium meal of a reformed over cooked braised steak didnt match a similar menu on BA or Emirates (economy) salad and cheesecake was meagre as was offering juice as pre take off drink. Plastic cutlery and glassware dont enhance. Two cabin crew to an enlarged cabin coped well and to be fair it seemed our chap took a lot of pride in attention to detail. I fly to South America 3/4 x a year and will keep to my usual arrangement of taking special offers with vintage carriers. Disappointed to say I'm not won over.

### "did not provide any compensation"
Fort Lauderdale to Gatwick. The flight was cancelled as the plane ran over a metal object while on the runway. We waited for hours with no one really knew what to do and we  got a flight out two days later. Norwegian did not provide any compensation for the delay in the way of discounts. I was only going to London for four days so my trip was cut in half but they did not care. It is a low-cost airline so there is no food or water unless you pay for it which I did on my way out. The breakfast consisted of a tiny piece of turkey and cheese on a dry roll and minute pastry. They charge for the luggage which is $60 if you are even slightly over. They are cheap and you get uncomfortable seats. The staff were nice to me but I could see they were overworked. If you have to fly cheaply, this is the way to go but leave your expectations for anything other than a low-cost at home.

### "an ideal low-cost experience"
I was returning home from a family visit in the UK and decided to try Norwegian as they had recently launched long-haul services to/from Stewart International, near my home. They are the model for low-cost airlines: pay only for what you want, without having to sacrifice comfort or service. We were seated in a brand-new Boeing 737 MAX- much smaller than typically used for transatlantic travel but comfortable nevertheless. No personal audio/video entertainment. Meals have to be preordered but I purchased a small snack onboard. Polite staff, clean & modern plane, prompt ground services at both ends, overall an ideal low-cost experience. Looking for a cheap fare between US and UK? Consider Norwegian.

### "A 5 day delay"
Huge waste of my time and money. 1 day snow storm in North East. All flights were flying the next day from all airports. They cancelled my flight on Wednesday 7th with 24 hours of notice, and could not get me back to the UK until the following Monday! A 5 day delay. They pay for very little. You are picking up all the costs of that delay. Your car parked in the airport,  food, extra clothing, washing your clothes and losing your work and leisure time for 5 days. Completely unacceptable. This was a snowstorm. A 24/48 hour delay is acceptable. After that they should be putting you on other flights not stringing you out for days on their overbooked flights.

### "Very disappointing check in"
Gatwick to Buenos Aires. After recalling a really excellent trip to Oakland on Norwegian I was delighted to hear of their new route to Buenos Aires. Very disappointing check in for passengers requiring assistance. Despite obviously needing support and despite no queue I was required to follow the maze of cordon to the desk. I was told it was the managers choice. After having to ask about the pre booked assistance I was directed to the responsible company some distance from check in. The assistance was top rate but on boarding I had been allocated a window seat despite having an ankle brace and needing help to the toilet. The seating in economy is cramped and my companion and I regretted sorely not having paid the difference to fly with one of our usual airlines. The meal and drinks upgrade was seen not to be worth the the additional fee and having to pay for a blanket seems penny pinching.

### "a very good experience"
Flew Berlin to Oslo and return. Flight to Oslo was 45 minutes delayed, according to crew because of deicing procedure in Oslo which was likely correct as it was snowing the whole day there. Return flight was perfectly on time. Both airplanes were quiet, clean and the crew acted professionally and friendly, even though the flights were both full. The interior of the airplane was good, not like on board of many low cost carrier where you feel like in a bus with many advertisings inside. Check in was fast. Food could be purchased on board but i did not. Norwegian offer free wifi and an app with live TV which should work on most European flights where Wifi is available. As I did not know that in advance I did not download the app, therefore I cant judge it, however as many of my fellow travellers check their mails during the flight the wifi seems to work. Additionally they had overhead monitors where some sketches, adverts and info about destinations have been shown. Overall a very good experience, especially when considering that this is a low cost carrier. Surely one of the better ones.

### "choose another airline"
Unless you're very careful in how you book the flights and check your documents, you will have a nasty surprise at check in as we did - we apparently hadn't pre booked our meal or our hold bags (both of which had been included in our outward bound flight so we assumed the return flight would be the same). We paid $60 each to check in our hold bags and had no meals during the flight. The snack bar ran out less than an hour into a ten hour flight - not even tea available. No water offered to us at any point. Only the kindness of one of the stewards after he found a spare meal, stopped me fainting from hunger. Seats - awful, short, narrow and hard. A small selection of films available, no music channels. Staff, overworked, mostly brusque from coping with many complaining passengers. Unless you're desperate choose another airline.

### "they charge for everything"
New York to Copenhagen. The plane was nice, but I found staff rude. As a low-cost airline they charge for everything. It was the most expensive luggage I have ever checked. There were no free meals less you flew in premium, Which wasn't a problem since I brought my own food.

### "you are wasting your time"
Flew Madrid to Tenerife North with Norwegian. Given wrong times of our delayed flight via text message and from the desk. Plane already arrived than expected. No assistance given for a disabled person. Complained to customer services soon after. Last week, sent three emails, heard nothing. If you are thinking of sending emails to them, you are wasting your time.

### "had a really good cabin crew"
Flew Norwegian from Orlando to Gatwick. We were impressed with the ease of check in, although it always seems to take an age to get through security here. We had seats 1A and 1C which are both quite spacious but you are right next to the toilet, I'll try a different seat next time for this reason. We had a really good cabin crew team for this leg who made the flight very enjoyable. We found the food disappointing especially breakfast which was pathetic for the ticket price, this is an area that lets them down.

### "I recommend Norwegian very much"
I flew from Newark to Rome FCO on a very simple ticket. I didn't pay for food, or a checked bag. I boarded the flight on-time, the cabin was very modern, and I had a whole row to myself. The IFE was very good, a lot of good choices. I feel that Norwegian's crew and the overall vibe of the airline is superb. I recommend Norwegian very much!

### "We were pleasantly surprised"
Orlando to Paris. My Second round trip on Norwegian. First time was 2.5 years ago MCO-OSL and return. This time we left Orlando 2 hours late but did make up about 30 minutes by the time we landed in Paris. Return flight 20 days later was spot on time. I find 2 hours acceptable. We were pleasantly surprised about the attitude of the cabin crew and gate crews. Last time they were rude and surly. This time mostly from Europe and very pleasant. The only complaint was the cold in the cabin. Come on Norwegian, turn up the thermostats and stop trying to make money selling blankets. My wife and I are over 80 and my wife has some health problems. I asked the agent at the gate about any boarding stairs and he asked why. I told him about my wife and he said no stairs but he would board us during the first group which he did. We are grateful for the help. We got the impression Norwegian has improved since 2015 and hope it continues. When everything goes well all is well, but when situations go negative, Norwegian customer service is not always there. My only fear is getting stranded.

### "disorganized check in"
New York to Paris. A disorganized check in at JFK. I did the self check-in at the machine for carry on only passengers. But they did not mention that you must verify the weight of your combine carry-on and hand-bag. At the security, they asked me for a stamp. I must go back to the normal check-in line, then Norwegian required my carry-on to be checked in, then i must go to another line to pay 65$ and went back to the show the payment. A waste of time and money here.

### "I had a very nice experience"
Flew Rome FCO to Copenhagen. I tried Norwegian for the first time and I had a very nice experience. The aircraft was a brand new 737, the interior was nice and clean. The space between the seats not less then the other famous European airlines. Departure and arrival on time. Overall a nice flight! Complimentary WiFi on board.

### "impressed with the whole package"
Gatwick to New York. This was great value, high quality flight. I normally travel with work on BA, Virgin or Singapore Business Class. This time I was paying for myself so I chose Norwegian Premium. The cost was £1200, which for a midweek ticket was £4000 less than a BA club world ticket. You don't get a flat bed but for the price it's an amazing deal. The seat is like the old style business class seats before they did flat beds, really comfortable, loads of room and a great foot rest. The staff were lovely and the food was fine. As it's a new 787-9 it's really modern with a great IFE system. I was really impressed with the whole package, it's so much better than BA or Virgin premium economy, the seats and much, much bigger.

### "a few pounds over the limit"
Barcelona to Boston via Gatwick. I was a few pounds over the limit and rather than giving me the option to remove some products and add them to my checked etc. I was charged another 88 euros, all in all I spent over $220 for my checked luggage. The associate who helped me at the Barcelona airport was less than impressive, being rude. I was informed my 8 hour flight home would not have wifi. During my flight home, my laptop screen was damaged due to the passenger in front of me. I was told I would receive an email from customer service next morning after my flight about how this could be rectified, after no word for multiple days I attempted to email the address given to me by a flight attendant but it was undeliverable. When the flight attendant came to take pictures of what happened the passenger in front of me again reclined her seat, and nearly smashed my screen for a second time, this time in front of the flight attendant so he too saw exactly what had happened. Upon arrival at Logan, I landed just after 7 and didn't leave the airport until almost 9pm after waiting for BOS baggage delivery. I landed January 15th, as of today I have only heard from a twitter "representative" who informed me they were experiencing higher claims than normal.

### "completely satisfied with everything"
We flew Tel Aviv to Barcelona and Barcelona to Newark yesterday, and were completely satisfied with everything done by Norwegian. Both planes were modern and in good shape, crew was attentive, seats comfortable. Our first flight didn’t have a video system, but the second flight did. if worked great, great sound, decent movie selection. Glad I booked premium economy, not that much more money, but gets you a seat in the front of the plane, and 2 meals on the 8 hour flight.

### "an absolute waste of time and money"
Booked to fly Norwegian from Madrid to Singapore. I cannot begin to describe how completely incompetent and frustrating this airline is. Upon cancellation at 3am (after sitting on the tarmac for 3 hours), we were told by staff 'usually we would provide accommodation, but there is none available. Good luck. We waited until the customer service desk opened in the morning, only to have the staff say 'we just got in, we don't know what is happening. No effort was then made to answer any kind of questions, some as basic as 'will food and accommodation be reimbursed?'. Countless calls and emails to them later (mostly unreturned) and I have received half a dozen differing explanations as to where my compensation sits. I have heard anywhere between 1 week to 3 months. No staff member that I have spoken to could answer straightforward questions. They tend to overuse the phrases 'ASAP' and 'right away' although it's 6 weeks later and I am still yet to find out exactly their definitions of these terms - they certainly differ to my own definitions. What an absolute waste of time and money.

### "Cheap is all they have to offer"
Flew New York JFK to Paris CDG with Norwegian. Cheap is all they have to offer. I thought it would be enough, but it wasn't. Then, there was the stewardess in our economy area who had no pleasantries, served no water, she snacked, then she ignored us for eight hours until she stood before us to block our exit while she ushered the front cabin people out. Finally, she told us to go, while a large man ran like a football player at us. He knocked me out of the way to get out of the door. For this, she stood silently. What a cold and shabby airline.

### "arrive back 2 hours late"
New York to Gatwick. My first time flying with Norwegian has been my worst experience with an airline. Outbound the entertainment system was down for the flight. I was so bored and they gave no compensation. Return I am sitting at the gate waiting due to 2 delays (so far) as the flight has yet to land. I am therefore going to arrive back 2 hours late as it stands.

### " carry on that was a bit over 10kg"
Orlando to Copenhagen via Oslo. At Orlando Airport check in staff was one of the rudest and meanest person I have met. Thanks to her manager we finally got to our flight. She did not know in Europe the way they write the date is dd/mm/yy and not mm/dd/yy. after she got the passport she told me my passport is expired! even though I still had over 3 months left to renew my passport and that's because she could not read the correct date on my passport. The flight was very empty and a lot of space but she was giving me a hard time about my carry on that was a bit over 10kg. She said we have to pay $65x2 (flight connection) because we have a little over weight carry on and that bag has to be count as a second checked bag. After we were finally trying to pay the amount ($65) so we could be done, she on her phone laughing at something that seemed very funny to her at that time. They made me wait over an hour and half to check in because of all the problems they were giving me. Another problem was that in their system my nationality didn't match to the nationality they had for me so they kept going back and forth just to see what the problem is and who could fix it. This was like a nightmare to me.

### "arrive five minutes too late"
Gatwick to Seattle. Not only has customer service been unhelpful and rude, but they have thus far neglected to acknowledge the issue at hand. I went to check-in to my flight online, having no indications that this was not going to be a possibility, to find that online check-in is disabled. The only information I received regarding check-in from the airline was the time constraints. Here I am, about to check in as soon as it opens only to find out I have to be physically present for check-in at the airport, which is nearly two hours from my location. I rush to get there, hoping I’ll make it, only to arrive five minutes too late, and I was barred from boarding my original flight. This cost me over a thousand dollars in new flights just to get home, even though I booked these tickets months in advance. The airline has been citing their check-in time policy as reason not to refund me for my unused tickets. I was unable to make any of my connecting flights elsewhere because of them, and I was nearly stranded in London. It’s absurd that I’ve had to contact them to remind them that my issue is thus far still unsolved.

### "premium service that I did not receive"
This was my first booking with Norwegian for which I booked Premium seats on their London Gatwick - New York JFK route as my wife and I wanted to enjoy the Dreamliner 787 experience rather than on our usual BA/Virgin aircraft. As well as the cabin I wanted the flexibility of changing my tickets last minute as I am fortunate to be able to travel on a whim. The outbound flight on the 787 was satisfactory and met my expectation although the cabin crew whilst fulfilled their duty were the most miserable crew I have ever flown with. However, the return flight was awful. Upon entering the aircraft I noticed how shabby it was and after being show the premium cabin it dawned on me that this was not a Dreamliner. After we settled I looked at the emergency exit guide and was surprised to see that the aircraft had indeed been substituted with an old airbus A330 operated by Hifly - whom I would never choose to fly given the choice. I fly frequently so I have had substitutions in the past however I have always been made aware of this prior to going to the airport or at the latest by check-in. At no point before departure was notification received by email nor SMS and given the chance I would have changed my flights. On top of this no notification was given at either check-in or at the gate. Furthermore, neither the Captain nor cabin crew even acknowledged this change and carried on business as usual. After speaking to my fellow passengers, I was shocked to learn that this was in fact a regular occurrence with Norwegian on the JFK/LGW route with one passenger having been substituted 29 times as he only flies Sundays. Apparently Norwegian never flies the Dreamliner on Sundays and Tuesday even though their website states they do. I’m not sure if factual but the chap said that they only operate 7 Dreamliner’s. If you see all the routes they advertise you may wonder how they can service, all these routes with just this number of 787’s. I did contact Norwegian but their reply on 19/20.12.2017 was dismissive that they met their obligations to transport me from A to B. Whilst I agree with this in principal the fact remains I paid a substantial amount of money for a premium service that I did not receive. Whilst I may fly with Norwegian again if I want a cheap experience I will never pay for their premium or flex service as they knowingly substitute aircraft regularly yet continue to falsely advertise all the service and experiential benefits of flying the Dreamliner. If you want a cheap experience with old aircraft and no customer service, then I recommend everyone flies with Norwegian. If you want anything else then stick to the majors as you know what to expect.

### "we hit turbulence"
Flew Gatwick to Los Angeles. I have  flown with them a couple times in the past and while they're not my favorite airline (they charge you for water) I've never had a complaint until now. Somewhere over Greenland we hit turbulence, and not the kind that shakes the plane for a few moments before subsiding. It lasted over an hour. Obviously the airline can't control the weather and I'm not writing this review to blame them for that. But I am  disappointed by the lack of customer service/interface around this ordeal. The pilot came onto the intercom to announce that he had put on the fasten seatbelt sign and asked the flight attendants to take their seats. Aside from that, there was no comforting of frightened passengers, no warning of how long to expect the turbulence to last, and not a mention of or apology for the ordeal afterwards. Perhaps the flight crew are used to such things, but to the rest of us it was quite terrifying and I was perturbed by the lack of help during and after the episode.

### "Service on board is okay"
Oslo to Keflavik. I fly with Norwegian a lot of times, it’s the best low-cost airline in Europe (My “base airport” is Rome FCO). The last time I flew with Norwegian in December 2017. The prices are really competitive, and the service on board is good. I’m really tall so with the low-cost I need to pay a little bit more to have a seat in front of the emergency exit to make my flight confortable. Norwegian’s cabin crew are really nice, young and smiling! Service on board is okay. Sometimes there is the free WiFi on board ! I’m impressed because they are growing up really fast! They got a lot of routes and destination! Well done Norwegian! Recommended!

### "our seats were quite spacious"
We flew to London from JFK for our honeymoon in October 2016 and had a wonderful experience on Norwegian's flight. The plane felt very new and our seats were quite spacious for an economy flight. The flight attendants were very friendly and attentive to our needs. Coffee/tea, wine, snacks, and a meal were provided on the flight. We have no complaints and I would fly with them again.

### "none of us would get on flight"
Flight to Miami from CDG was supposed to be 6:10PM. We received a text in the morning saying : We're sorry to inform you that your Norwegian flight DY7047 from Paris (CDG) to Fort Lauderdale (FLL) 09.01.2018 is delayed due to late arriving aircraft. Your new estimated departure time is 20:45 local time. Please contact our airport representatives for meal vouchers. If you don't wish to travel on this flight, you can rebook your ticket free of charge online. To read about your rights, visit www.norwegian.com/rights. when I arrived at 6:30pm to checking, about 30 people where in line and no representative from Norwegian. they had closed the check in at original time at 6p. they refused to check any of us in, one representative came for 5 min said none of us would get on the flight and the next flight was next saturday. They kept telling us to call the "24/7" customer service but when we called it said their office was closed.

### "Don't waste your money on this airline"
Flew Norwegian from Newark to Rome. Don't waste your money on this airline. I ended up paying for my food, luggage, and reservation for my seat which led to me not saving any money for flying this budget airline. First, dont even bother reserving early to get the exit row because the seats are so tight that you will be uncomfortable anyway so why even get leg room when you don't have any shoulder space. Food was the worst food I have ever had which I paid 50$ for. Blankets/pillow/snacks and even water (super low of them to sell water, its a human need) you need to pay extra for.

### "failed to provide the service it advertised"
Norwegian are to be congratulated on providing the worst customer experience I've encountered in 20 years flying. I'm a regular flyer, and in the past year have persisted with Norwegian multiple times to travel from London to New York due to the cheap cost. Never again. The service is basic (verging on rude), uncomfortable, but is just about tolerable if nothing goes wrong. However, any sign of trouble, and customer service becomes invisible. On multiple occasions the airline has failed to provide the service it advertised, and during the recent winter weather (January 2018) successfully abandoned hundreds of passengers in New York with no communication on how they would get home or receive compensation. I can only recommend you avoid this airline - the extra cost to fly transatlantic with another carrier is worth it.

### "it's all about dollars with them"
Flew Norwegian from Amsterdam to Los Angeles. A two hour stop in Copenhagen became a 36 hr stop! I got to my destination 2 days late. Every two hours they would text "sorry for the delay, in two hours we will update you with the time and the gate for departure". They kept me in the airport on the first day for 10 hours and then the entire day the following day. The weather was great at the departure and arrival airport but they kept saying we were delayed due to weather conditions. I checked on other airlines and they were flying fine. They are dishonest and don't care about customer service or the passenger, just $$$. The seats offer very little leg room this coming from a person whis 5 8". The seat cushions are thin and uncomfortable. Don't ever waste a single dollar on this airline because they don't care about the passenger, it's all about dollars with them.

### "offered nothing in terms of help"
Los Angles to Copenhagen. After an hour delay without advance notice, our flight from LAX to CPH took off only to turn around and return to LAX after about 45-minutes in the air. We were told it was due to technical issues. We spent an hour on the tarmac before I waited another hour and a half to get my bag back. Then followed a two-hour wait to ask about accommodation. We were offered no food or drinks, and by the time I spoke to an agent it was nearly 5am, about 12-hours after arriving at the airport. I was offered to share a hotel room / cot with three other passengers. I said I'd prefer a room by myself, the agent walked away. 15-minutes later I told him I'd take anything, I'm tired, and was told the rooms were gone. I have no credit card and no cash and was given to other options. Their support hotline has an hour or more wait, if you don't get a busy tone 10-15 times when trying to call. They were friendly if not fatigued, but offered nothing in terms of help.

### "back to Lufthansa and United"
Paris CDG to New York JFK. First time and last time. Not coordinated at all. Customer service line has no knowledge and still sitting on the ground at JFK since 3 hours because ground crew in Paris could not handle boarding everyone on time. Don’t fly into a snow storm for 5 hours if you can not land at destination and then fly back to you departure city for another five hours. The next flight was moved and canceled twice and and Norwegian website was not up to date. Norwegian has to charter a plane to fly us to New York. They chose Wamos Air, a Spanish airline. At check in most of the boarding passes could not be printed and because of that we left 2 hours late. The food on the plane was from Norwegian from the previous day and there was no customer service from the crew because they had Norwegian catering on a Wamos Air plane. This is a 48 hour trip. If Norwegian would be organized and thoughtful things like this would not happen. That was the first time I used a budget airline and never again. Back to Lufthansa and United

### "horrible for a 10 hour flight"
Flew Norwegian from London to Las Vegas. No food on flight (which I would expect for a 10 hour flight). Flight was delayed 2 hours and no air conditioning. Seats are so cramped. Seat hardly goes back. On the way back someone vomitted on the aisle and wasn't cleaned up. Again horrible for a 10 hour flight.

### "recommend this airline"
Gatwick to Singapore. Really pleasantly surprised with this Norwegian flight. The check in agents could have been more friendly. Be aware that their limit on cases in 20kg per case, even if you purchase more luggage, one case can not be more than 20kg. Really pleased with our seats, 9B and 9C. Extra legroom and some, we had an exit in front of us so my boyfriend (whom of which is over 2 metres tall) could get really comfortable here. In flight entertainment is good, not loads of films but enough. We  loved the snack bar at your fingertips, you can order from your seat on the screen, swipe your card and the crew bring your order to your seat, and the crew are very on top of this. We ordered in flight meals, of which for this 12 hour flight we got 2 whole meals, dinner and breakfast, and a sandwich in between. The sandwich was a bit small and I had to order from the bar, and the meals were as  expected. The Boeing 787 was really nice, clean and up to date, and the new technology used to reduce jet lag and make you feel better after such a long flight did  work. We felt refreshed and awake when we arrived, however the extra oxygen pumped into plane to make you feel this way, also makes it hard to sleep, and on a night flight it’s a hard toss up of which you’d prefer! The cabin crew were really helpful and friendly. My tips would be to bring snacks, as the bar is pricey, and your own blanket, headphones and eye mask if you can, as these are not supplied free of charge. Overall I’d really recommend this airline to anyone.

### "crew were very efficient"
Helsinki to Palma de Mallorca return. First leg was more than 3 hours late. They gave us a voucher worth of 10 euro for refreshments. The flight itself was fine. Cabin attendants were nice and smiling, very polite. That was also on return flight. On return flight a sickness attack of a passenger in front of me, and the crew were very efficient and professional dealing with that.

### "arrived home 5 hours late"
Los Angeles to Gatwick on 27 November 2017. We were due to leave at 18.35. We arrived at airport at 15.15 and were told we could not check our bags until 17.30 due to delayed flight. Staff could not tell us how long we would be delayed. We were given meal vouchers for $12 each. When we went through security the gate information had departure time of 18.35 crossed out and this was later changed to 21.30. At 21.50 we were called to gate and bussed to plane. There were about 60 people on the bus and we all boarded the plane with Norwegian staff checking our boarding passes. Then we found our seats already occupied - they had taken us to Norwegian flight to Barcelona. We were then taken to Gatwick flight and sat on plane for 2 hours. The captain spoke over intercom and apologised and gave no reason other than late arrival of earlier flight. He said we would be taking off as soon as we were given a slot. Cabin crew couldn't tell you anything. We weren't offered anything to drink while we waited. We took off at 1215. An announcement was made that meals would be served immediately to those who had ordered one. We arrived home 5 hours late. Many people had missed connecting flights. We had to drive home in the dark when we had booked a flight where we could travel home in daylight. Norwegian did not do anything to make up for the delays. They update customers by messaging apps or mobile phone, not everyone has one when they travel.

### Norwegian customer review
Edinburgh to New York. For a price of £300 round trip Edinburgh - New York during Christmas season you can't ask much. I mean the price is unbeatable. The flight was smooth. I have only one complaint and that's why I don't give 9/10 for this airline. Is the quality of customer service before flight through chat. They informed me that there would be in flight entertainment in the form of personal screen and movies with sound. However that was not the case - the funny part is that when we were boarding there was advertisement in the few screens that were available on top of some seats about the in flight entertainment, WiFi, cool movies with sound etc. However, the aircraft did not provide anything related to that so I was disappointed. The only sort of entertainment - if someone can call that entertainment was the screening of some episodes of the Big Bang Theory but without sound - there were subtitles though. I don't mind paying less and getting less - just do not give expectations about things you do not provide.

### "not fix the booking mistake"
Boston to Bergen via Gatwick. I made an error when changing a booking. I called within 30 minutes of the error but Norwegian would not fix the booking mistake without a $260 change fee and $200 name change fee. I asked if they would honor the 24 hour refund policy but the agent said it does not apply to booking changes. When I pointed out that the change price exceeds the original ticket value, they recommended I try to sell my ticket on eBay instead. I would not attempt to book again with this airline.

### "attempts to get a refund"
Gatwick to Singapore. I can't review the flight on 22 November as it was cancelled, the review has more to do with the level of service during this time and the attempts to get a refund for additional costs I paid at the airport (over my weight allowance for my luggage.) It started with a 1 hour flight delay, I could tell that there was no way that the flight was going to leave within the 6 hour window I had given myself or at all. When the flight was finally cancelled they provided 1 member of staff to inform us, didn't given any additional information, said they might be able to get us out on a flight the next day. The staff was very rude and direct, I was refused a refund for the additional costs I had paid at the airport and have sent almost 30 emails trying to get it back and only got a response when I threatened legal action. I have had cancelled flights before and the airlines haven't been great but never to this level.

### "service onboard was excellent"
Gatwick to Oslo. This was my first flight with Norwegian. Both outbound and inbound flight were full. The aircraft were quite new and very clean. The service onboard was excellent with friendly crews. On my return from Oslo I requested to change my flight to the direct LGW service, there were a couple of seats available and the ground staff were extremely helpful in changing my flight. I was delighted as it meant I could travel with my son who was already booked on the flight. I'll definitely fly Norwegian again and look forward to flying their Boeing 787 to Fort Lauderdale in the future.

### "26+ hour delay"
Flew Norwegian from Boston to London Gatwick. 26+ hour delay, multiple trips to airport, crew no-show, technical problems, massive confusion, lack of staff, worst air experience I have ever had in 20 years of flying. Even the aircraft didn’t show up 26 hours after scheduled time during the second boarding attempt. An unimaginable level of incompetence.

### "has a lot to learn in terms of professionalism"
This is regarding our in-flight experience on 20th November while flying from Singapore to London with Norwegian. Overall the experience was OK, some of the positives being that the Boeing Dreamliner is great. Seats are comfortable, the entertainment system is contemporary. We got a good price also and the food on menu was not bad. However there were a couple of things which bothered us: 1) One of the flight attendants was rude. Most of the crew was British and there were some good attendants on the flight but unfortunately for us, the man serving us was rude to us on more than one occasion. He would ask us to tell him our names before handing over the food we had paid for like we were prisoners. To others he would patiently explain the menu, to us he would come and shout "Chicken or fish". Once my wife changed her mind and asked to change her initial meal choice from chicken to fish, to which he very rudely exclaimed - "Oh you want fish now ! . 6 hours into the flight, he woke us to give the snack. I was a bit sleepy and asked him if we could have it later, he snapped back and said "No, you can have it now or not have it at all". 2) There were no headphones on the flight. First of all, we were not aware that we had to buy headphones. I can understand the airline is trying to save cost and pass on that benefit to the consumer, but it would be good if they can add a note in the booking that passengers need to arrange their headphones or buy in-flight. Anyways, it was only 3$ so we asked to buy when we were told there were no headphones on the flight. Upon asking why, the staff told us they "forgot to load up". On a 13 hour flight, that can be a bit annoying. We spent the 13 hours without headphones. I have travelled with Norwegian in Scandinavia before and the staff have been very polite, sharp and courteous. This crew (with some exceptions) has a lot to learn in terms of professionalism in my opinion.

### "3 months since I applied for claims"
Right from the day of departure we had trouble. On the departure day, I got a text stating my flight was cancelled I need to call them to re-book or get refund. We had a trip planned for 2 weeks we couldn't cancel and refund! We decided to take re-book option, they changed our departure airport, we had to go to JFK instead of SWF. We drove our car to JFK, took a connecting flight to Gatwick to get to Edinburgh. Our original flight was non stop to Edinburgh from SWF. I could have done the connecting flight myself if I wanted to. This threw off our whole trip, had lot of my reservations cancelled. We lost lot of money right there. To top it off, our return flight was going back to SWF. So we had to get a rental car back to JFK to pick up our car. Again lot of hassle and driving, fuel and toll charges. We still did our trip even though we lost a day and lost some reservations. We came back and applied for claim, Norwegian said they could only refund for toll and fuel charges ($32). After all the trouble we had with their flight cancellation. I was stunned to see this response. I am still fighting to get some refund. Its been 3 months since I applied for claims.

### "certain companies aren't family friendly"
Flew Helsinki to Malaga. Its always a pity to see that certain companies aren't family friendly. Our flight to Spain had a few empty seats and the company didn't bother to allocate families with babies in those rows. There even was one passenger using three seats on his own. Also to point out that if a baby is sleeping the flight attendants don't need use loud voices to ask you if you'd like coffee. Last but not least, this is the second time that Norwegian manages to lose our baby pushchair in a direct flight. The most disgraceful part is that they always smile at you and say, it will come tomorrow but never does.

### "the fees are ridiculous"
Orlando to Copenhagen in July 2017. The fees are ridiculous, that I might as well have chosen a different airline, no money saved by choosing Norwegian Airlines. What’s baffling is the seat fee of $50 each way, the reservation options trick you into thinking you need to reserve a seat.

### "still here, it may be longer"
Seattle to Gatwick. A 30 min delay  then turned into 2 hours then into 8 hours, still here, it may be longer. The counter staff had no idea what the issue was. Having just had a big meal they then issued meal tickets that it turns out don't work for wine. In fairness their telephone customer service actually answered and the chap was very nice but fairly useless. You get what you pay for and whilst I loved the cheap fare am now regretting not going.

### "Overall service was good"
Helsinki to Rovaniemi. Overall service was good. Yesterday I was surprised by the size of some passengers carry on bags. The cabin crew struggled to fit some of the bags in the overhead compartments. Today I was let down with the check in service. My luggage weighed 22.3kg and I was asked to pay for anything over 20kg or remove something from my check in bag. I moved aside unpacked my bag and removed my laptop. On returning to check in something made me think I should question my allowance as I was sure 23kg was my allowance. It turns out I could take two bags at 23kg. So I stepped aside and put the laptop back in the check in luggage bag. Nothing too serious but it was extremely inconvenient having to pack and repack when the service consultant could have checked my allowance on the system as a first point of call. In her defence she has a supervisor with her that in my opinion was not customer orientated. A smiles goes a long way.

### "lack of customer service"
Copenhagen to London Gatwick. I flew with Norwegian on 4th of December from Copenhagen to London Gatwick. I never write reviews for airlines because as long as it takes me from point A to B safely I don't make a fuss but today's flight disgusted me. We had a delay of more than one hour and a half. Only after embarking all and siting in the plane for more than 30 min, everybody looking at the watch impatiently, they gave us a lame excuse. No wifi available though they advertise it big time and old aircraft. The "icing on the cake" though was the rude staff. Even if your customer service is not your forte at least in situations like this you can make an effort. I understand there are rules that need to be respected but there are nice ways of saying them, not snapping at people, raising the voice and patronise the passengers showing not only lack of customer service but also manners. Norwegian, please invest in training for customer service and send your staff from today's flight.

### "Norwegian was a disappointment"
Oslo to New York on December 1st. The flight was delayed for 75 minutes with no explanation. The new time was only posted on the monitor at the gate. The attitude of the staff was dismissive with an undertone of "just deal with it". On board, one of the first order of business was an announcement, notifying those who pre-order meals,  that they would be immediately served, and others who did not pre-order was directed to the menu on the screen where they could do so. These are the cost of a few items, water $3.00 beer 6.50, Coco Cola 3.00, sandwich 7.00. Approximately 1 hr after the pre-orders and upper classed were served, (maybe 2 hours in flight) a cart appeared in the aisle. We were offered a choice of chicken or beef with a side order. The space was cramped and uncomfortable. As a low cost airline if you want amenities, such as a headphone, blanket or headrest, there was a cost factor. No WiFi was available in flight. Flying Norwegian was a disappointment. The pilots were excellent, the cockpit crew eventually apologized for the delays. We were scheduled to arrive at 20:00 but arrive at 21:36.

### "No news at all from Norwegian"
Flew New York JFK to Paris CDG. Flight was first delayed without any notice after security check. Waited 6 hours until 2am at JFK, then staff put us in hotels. No news at all from Norwegian. The next day they tell us the next flight is cancelled again. No further information is given. The day after, same thing. The hotel informs us Norwegian maintained the reservation. No news at all from Norwegian themselves. Finally in the afternoon we receive a text message to ask us to call a number and rebook our flight. I had to pay to call from my cellphone and +45 minutes waiting time. Customer service is terrible. Finally got a flight from another company. Total delay: 72 hours. Customer service: non existant. I missed all my doctors appointment, missed one day at work and above all horrible customer service. I feel like we were treated worse than cattle. Shame on Norwegian. WIll never take this company ever again.

### "a nice safe flight"
Gran Canaria to Oslo. I would like to thank Norwegian Airlines for a nice safe flight. Boarding was on time, fast and fluent. Nice and clean new B-737 aircraft. Reasonable seat distance. In-flight entertainment. High-speed Free Wifi to all passengers through the six-hour flight. Cabin Crew looked fresh and groomed, helping passengers at all times. Arrived in Oslo 20 min early. The Captain gave Norwegian and English info.

### "only noodle soup and muffins"
Bergen to Alicante. The flight started with all four attendants disappearing from the cabin 20 minutes after takeoff for their unison, leaving passengers to study the menus meanwhile with the aircon set to cold. After reappearing, we were informed by the attendants that only noodle soup and muffins were our food options for the three hour late evening flight. The aircon was then changed to hot.

### "forced me to check my carry-on"
New York to Gatwick. I've been flying with this airline for over 4 years usually twice per year. First, I received a text message from the airline a few days before my flight informing me that the flight would no longer be operated by Norwegian, but would be operated by HiFly and that there would likely be no entertainment on the plane. They were nice enough to tell me I could reschedule or cancel my flight and get a refund -  3 days before I was leaving, I wonder what the updated prices would be? Second, today when I arrived at the check-in counter the attendants weighed my carry-on luggage. It was exactly 9kg which is under the required limit, until they told me my handbag had to go on the scale as well for a combined weight! They then proceeded to charge me $65 for 4 extra pounds of weight and forced me to check my carry-on! My personal favorite part of this was the woman who stamped "paid" on my boarding pass along side a smiley face! As if that was going to make me happy that I had just paid $65 for my purse to go on the plane. This airline should be ashamed of their shady business practices. I will never fly with them again.

### "had to land and re-fuel"
Edinburgh to Hartford. Bad start boarding with some passengers from a cancelled Norwegian flight from previous day. Before take-off, front row passengers were asked to move to the back seats to assist aircraft balance. In midatlantic, captain announced that head winds meant we were short of reserve fuel, and had to land and re-fuel at Montreal.

### "I lost my hand luggage"
Stockholm to Gatwick. You get to your destination safely and have a decent seat but their customer service could be improved. Both of my flights were  delayed followed by "sorry for the delay". The flight to Stockholm was delayed by an hour. I lost my hand luggage while waiting for the flight, couldn't find airport security around so I reported to the airline staff who said I could file a report when I get to London. It turned out of courser that I should have reported this to the airport missing items.

### "great legroom space"
New York JFK to Martinique. First time flying Norwegian and probably won't be my last. Budget airlines with great legroom space, reasonable prices for food / drinks and great customer service along with WiFi. Staff was pleasant and service great! Pilots gave updates frequently in regards to the distance to our destination.

### "very comfortable and safe flight"
Malaga to Tenerife 17th Nov, departure at 07:15. Boarding was on time, fluent and easy. Boeing 737-800 was new and clean. Good seat comfort and reasonable distance. Free High Speed Wifi for all passengers through the flight. In Flight Entertainment via general screens and through your personal electronic devices. Cabin Crew looked fresh and groomed with a nice, warm approach to all passengers, paying attention to safety. I felt it was a very comfortable and safe flight.

### "flight attendants were very nice"
I flew Norwegian from Prague to Orlando with a 6-hour stopover in Copenhagen. The flight to Copenhagen went very quickly. Almost no traffic in Prague. After arriving at Kastrup, I had 6 hours to kill in the airport. I got coffee, checked out some of the duty-free shops and sat down at a small lounge for a while. I surfed the internet with the airport's wifi and watched outside airport operations in the cold rain. When I had about 1 hour left I decided to go thru passport control and to my boarding gate. Boarding finally started and did not take very long. Their IFE was very well set up. The flight attendants were very nice. Food was great. Both flights went by quickly. I can definitely recommend Norwegian.

### "an old A340 leased from HiFly"
Oslo to New York JFK. Norwegian advertise that you will fly in a new Boeing 787 but we got an old A340 leased from HiFly. The condition of the plane was disgusting. Almost all seats were broken, the seats were very small, the in-flight entertainment system did not work and when they switched the cabin lights off during the flight there were no personal lights working. The staff manning the flight were completely un-interested in the concerns of the passengers. I have logged a complaint with Norwegian but no reply yet. This was 8th flight with Norwegian and by far the very worst.

### "prioritising their own tasks"
Los Angeles to Gatwick on Low Fare. I travelled with 2 infants and airline staff and policies were not helpful. Bulkhead seating was not prioritized for families. In both directions more than 1 family with small children were onboard but none got the bulkhead seating or extra space for bassinet supposedly available for young families. On the return journey staff were unhelpful, prioritising their own tasks during food service over customer convenience.

### "upgrade got me into the lounge"
Oslo to Los Angeles. Seats are tiny in economy so I upgraded to fly home, but my flight today is delayed by 2.5 hours. At least the upgrade got me into the lounge. This is my 3rd flight with Norwegian and each one was late by at least half an hour. Coming to Europe I ordered food on the flight but was told it was sold out just 2 hours into the flight. The airline may be cheap but the cattle car style of packing people into tiny seats is  not a good deal for me.

### "would not endorse this airline"
Flew Norwegian from Gatwick to Oslo. At Gatwick airport I was forced to pay an additional 90 pounds sterling for baggage but I had already purchased an additional bag the previous night online. The airline refused to acknowledge this so in order to depart I was forced to pay the additional money. I have tried to claim it back for the last 2.5 months and sent almost 20 emails to their refund department. They finally agreed to refund my money but have short changed me by $28. I was never told I would not receive the full amount so I expected to receive the 90 pounds and had hoped to be compensated for the payment delays and costs incurred by having to use my credit card at Gatwick. I did not expect to be short changed. I would not endorse this airline ever!

### "I asked for a refund"
Bangkok to Oslo. The flight was due to depart November 5 at 10.45 am. Delayed until 1.15 pm. Then zero communication until 4pm and flight cancelled. The Novotel hotel is nice. Food great. I assumed on the morning of the 6th an airline representative would be at the hotel, but no, hotel has provided the information. Flight delayed until November 7th at 9am, at 8 pm November 6th..flight delayed. Until November 8th at 5am! The airline lied to us all that an email was sent with each cancelled update. Nobody got an email. I asked for a refund. 3 nights at an airport hotel is ridiculous.

### "don't book with Norwegian"
Flew Los Angeles to Paris. Next time I will not fly these low-cost airlines! The price looks good, but that's because you have to pay for everything else, including water. For people like us who did not pay for meal service, they didn't even offer us water! Also, we had to pay for every piece of luggage we checked in, we ended up paying $150 for luggage. If you are looking to get some decent travel experience, don't book with Norwegian!

### "last time ever with Norwegian"
First time, most definitely, last time ever with Norwegian. I can only add my voice to all my fellow travelers who were on flight DY7015 from London to New York City. I never received an email telling me the flight was canceled. We were given a hotel but not fed. We had to pay out of pocket to eat. I missed my train connection from JFK. The next day, 11/1/17, I was rerouted to Sweden with a 4 to 5 hour layover that turned into 7 or 8 hours due to mechanical problems. They wouldn't let us leave the waiting room at the airport no matter how many people begged that they were hungry. I did not get to New York until well after midnight. Now it's 11/2/17. The earliest train was at 3.25am. I did not get home until 5.15am. It was the worst travel experience, ever. Customer service was abysmal. They were complaining to us the passengers how they weren't told anything, it wasn't their fault, etc. Surly staff. Apathetic and pathetic. Do not be fooled by low price!

### "no available other flights"
Alicante to Gatwick. Flight cancelled and no available other flights for that day. Offered flight to Gatwick for the following day via Helsinki, we asked for a direct flight and the next available was in six days time and there was only one seat on that. The desk staff gave us vouchers for a taxi one way to a hotel and a voucher for the hotel, no luck there. No room or didn't accept the ticket. Sent to next hotel who had no twin beds available and offered bunk beds in a budget hotel, we are both 70 yrs old. We declined and went back to the airport. The Norwegian  desk was closed and we were stranded in Alicante. The girl at the end of the phone could still only offer Helsinki. We arranged a taxi to a hotel ourselves and booked with Ryanair for flights home the next day. We have submitted a claim for our expenses plus compensation. Hope to hear soon.

### "Delay after delay, lie after lie"
Flew Norwegian from Denver to London Gatwick. The worst flying experience of my life. I waited for ten hours for them to constantly tell us 30 minutes, 30 minutes we will depart. Rudest airline attendants I have ever met. What a nightmare. Delay after delay, lie after lie. They told some passengers the night before through email that it would be delayed but others got nothing. They are so disorganized I have never seen such a lack of capability in an airline. What a joke. When I went to check in with their ticket counter I walked past several times because they did not have a sign. They boarded us after 8 hours of delay then kept us in seats for another hour and a half refusing us to move around or allowing us to use the bathroom. They told us we would depart, than changed their story and gave us some rubbish about checks, this is so frustrating. Completely unproffesionnal and utter lack for human decency or common truth.

### "Nice leg space for the feet"
Flew Bangkok to Molde via Oslo. Norwegian is the airline I fly with when I visit Asia. I like the Boeing 787. Nice leg space for the feet. Snackbar is okay, could have had a bigger selection. Everything is okay and good, but the inflight entertainment is awful! Only liberal TV-shows and movies. There does not seem to be any TV-shows, movies or good documentaries for men. No classic movies like Terminator, 48 hours or Rocky. And no classic TV-shows like Seinfeld, Frasier, Cheers etc.

### "Norwegian was a pleasure to fly"
Flew Norwegian from Munich to Malaga. Boarding was a bit of a mess as they didn’t board families first although we were told they would do so. Flight was delayed for about 45 minutes due to congestion at the airport, this was communicated after everyone had boarded so we weren’t off to a good start. On the plus side seatbelt and life jacket for the baby were on the seat waiting for us and the travel stroller was allowed on board without issues. Seats had plenty of room and the plane was clean and new. The flight was smooth, the crew friendly and in the end they made up the lost time so we arrived as planned. The free wifi worked as advertised and the range of free entertainment was a welcome surprise. For a discount carrier they offer more than LH does on the same route the only thing is you have to buy your food and drinks. Their website is easy to use but for whatever reason you couldn’t use the online checkin feature. This was not really an issue as the process was quick and painless at the counters. Norwegian really was a pleasure to fly as long as you keep to their rules.

### "No one has a clue what's going on"
Ft Lauderdale to Paris CDG. Our flight was delayed due to maintenance to a departure (from 10:30 pm to 12:50 am), no big deal. Then they boarded the stewards and announced they would begin boarding in a few minutes. 5 minutes later, we're delayed "at least 2 hours to locate a part" 5 minutes after that "the flight has been cancelled. So now it's 1am and everyone rushes back to the other terminal (because god knows why they aren't in the same one)? The gentleman says they are re-booking the flight for the morning and if we didn't have a place to stay to go home and wait for text updates (also okay). I call the airline to get an update around 1:30am am to confirm this is true, they say it's being rebooked for "10 to 12 hours from now" and I'm cool with going home for zzz's. Wake up next day to not a single alert. Call back. We cannot get you on a flight until next Wednesday (6 days from my original flight.) Call back again. We have no information to update you with. Call back again. We can get you on a flight on Saturday but not in the original class booked. I'm sorry what? No one has a clue what's going on from the top to the bottom.

### "arrived late back to the UK"
New York to Gatwick. We flew return from London to New York On our flight out we had to sit on the ground at the airport for over an hour in JFK  which is not helpful when you have arranged a pick up service. However it gets very poor on our return flight. At check in the staff were very rude and unhelpful. We checked in 4 hours early as recommend, as we got through the security checks I noticed that the flight time on my ticket had changed, once in the departure lounge we found we were delayed by 2 hours which the staff clearly knew about as they printed our tickets. However they neglected to inform us of this. 30 mins later we get a text saying we are delayed, go see a member of Norwegian staff and they will sort out a meal voucher for you. We thought ok that is nice of them. In the coming hours we saw 3 members of staff and each of them said "it’s nothing to do with me. I don’t know what you are talking about" so basically they didn’t want to know. We arrived late back to the UK missing our trains costing us £118 to replace. I’ve spoken to Norwegian on the phone and they informed me it will be 6-8 weeks to look at my issue as complaints is busy and backed up. They may seem cheap but it will cost you elsewhere so be warned.

### "unmotivated and unfriendly staff"
Flew Barcelona to Newark. Norwegian offers low fares, great. They offer a staff of unfriendly people and they have very odd business practice of not offering any food or drinks unless you pay extra prior to flying or in cabin. They will not offer you even water to drink on an overseas flight. Better bring your credit card, the staff certainly couldn’t care less if you were there. They simply look through you and would rather be elsewhere. I’ve never seen more unmotivated and unfriendly staff with any other airline I’ve flown and I fly every week for business. I rate Norwegian an overall big fat 1 out of 10 and it’s well deserved.

### "cheap prices can come at a cost"
I booked a nonstop flight from Paris to Orlando to return November 4, 2017. I happened to get on the app to double check my reservation and saw an alert that said “there is a change to your reservation”. Upon opening the alert I see Norwegian has decided to change my return date to Nov 2. No email, no text, no call- I just luckily looked at the booking in advance vs my usual habit of just looking the day before. Lucky, as I can see me assuming all is well and not realizing until the day of flight. When I called I was told my only option is to return 2 days early or 5 days later, or fly into an airport 4 hours south. Needless to say I am ticked as I now have to buy a new ticket less than 2 weeks out and more than double the price since I’m not okay with cutting my vacation short. They did offer a full refund at least. Buyer beware, their cheap prices can come at a cost.

### "recommended for the price paid"
New York JFK to Gatwick. Very positive experience. Brand new airplane, I love the new light-shading possibility of the windows and their bigger size too. Nice and relaxed crew. Food and beverages can be ordered upon a touch of a button on your personal screen. Absolutely recommended for the price paid.

### "flight was freezing"
Norwegian is below low end. The check in staff at LA were rude and dismissive. Finally after checking our bags we spent about 2 hours trying to board the flight and left about an hour late with no explanation from cabin crew or captain. There was no safety demonstration from cabin crew just a video in the cabin. Once we took off they served us a warm meal which we had preordered and half of the passengers didn't get anything. You are allowed one cold and one hot drink at the time of your meal, and after that you have to pay for water. After that they turned the aircon down, the flight was freezing. I would say this is so they can charge you for a blanket but they didn't have any stock. The cabin crew were asked numerous times about the temperature and just replied "I'll see what we can do" and nothing happens. Everyone was sat on a 9.5 hour flight cold in coats and scarves. It was pleasant walking off the plane into the autumnal air of 15 degrees, and still nothing from the pilot. Cheap, slightly - worth it, no.

### "always had positive experiences"
Manchester to Stockholm. I usually fly short-haul around 10 times a year with Norwegian, back and forth between the UK and Scandinavia for the most part, and have always had positive experiences. The flights are basic, but it isn't expensive to add on extras such as baggage/seat allocation (much cheaper than the other budget airlines out there!) - these additions can also be made up to 24 hours before flight time, so if you realise a day before that you want an extra bag you don't have to pay any more than if you decide this at the time of booking. Their rewards system is also great, and you can get free seat allocation, fast track and baggage allowances the more often you fly with them. Although you don't get anything on the flight, when you are flying short haul this really isn't an issue - you can buy a bottle of water at the airport (or, if you are in Scandinavia, you can fill up your own bottle for free from drinking fountains in the airports!) and take a snack with you if you so wish, but their flights are usually only 2-4 hours around Europe so you don't need anything else. I often download a film or a couple of episodes of a TV series onto my iPad and watch these on the flight, or just read a book - so not having in-flight entertainment doesn't bother me. They also have WiFi on a lot of flights, which tends to be intermittent at times. My only gripe is that their flights can sometimes be delayed by up to an hour (I've never experienced a longer delay in 40+ flights with them, although I do know people who have been unlucky enough to). The delays can be frustrating, but they tend to make up time in the air. Also, they are on average half the price of their competitors so I am happy to spend an extra 45 mins reading a book at the airport to get a cheaper flight.

### "do not recommend this airline"
Gatwick to Madrid on 10th October. The flight was delayed 2h, and when we finally got onboard the crew told us we would have to wait up to 3hours before we could take off. We finally did not take off (after waiting more than one hour inside) and stayed at the airport the whole night (our flight has been rescheduled the day after early in the morning). No hotel was provided. Even though some of the staff were amazing, others were really rude and the lack of customer care and communication are the reasons why I do not recommend this airline.

### "troubles with flight times"
Copenhagen to Riga. Always troubles with flight times. The previous time my flight (Aal-CPH, which takes 45 minutes) was delayed for almost an hour, which caused me to miss the next flight. Flight attendants promised that I can get help at the airport, but all the standard were already closed. The phone number works only during office hours, so there was no way I could contact the company. This time I arrived to the gate 20 minutes before the time on the ticket, but there was no one there. I had to watch my plane just stand there for 20 minutes and then leave!

### "I really enjoyed the flight"
Copenhagen to Helsinki. The flight departed in the evening with one hour delay, I received the message on my phone, but I was already at the airport at that moment. The plane was half occupied by passengers, that allowed me to have three seats for me, so window and aisle at the same time. The crew was super friendly and when I asked for the coffee menu and realise that they didn't accepted my card, since I didn't had cash with me, they offered me a free coffee! It was my first time flying with Norwegian and I really enjoyed the flight, going to fly with them again, at the same level of conventional airlines withing Europe, really recommended.

### "the cabin was woefully understaffed"
Airline with atrocious service, on par (and in some ways worse) than the likes of Spirit and Frontier. I flew a couple of Norwegian routes in the last few days: 1) Prague to Copenhagen, and 2) London-Gatwick to Seattle. The first annoyance was the inability to check in online, which for the first route required lining up at the airport for 30 minutes (as someone who never checks bags, the only place I've had to do this is Cuba). While the plane itself was a beautiful new Boeing 787-dreamliner with the latest in tech, the cabin was woefully understaffed. While I understand the ideology of charging for everything on this airline, the lack of any basic amenities offered by was unbelievable. Only once in an 11 hour nightmare, after begging a flight attendant, was I given water on the plane. Apparently, they require that you purchase a $5 bottle of water, not only is this environmentally irresponsible, but grossly negligent to those customers who may not want to pay for extras. I was very dehydrated with a massive headache when I arrived, a scenario echoed by multiple passengers I spoke with following the second overseas route. Halfway through the flight I tried to purchase a sandwich, but they were sold out, 5 hours before landing. When I inquired, they told me I need to reserve specific meals ahead of time. How many people know what they want to eat on a plane, days in advance? Or want the headache of remembering what added services they have purchased on each ofpotentially several flights (I had 10 flights on this trip)?

### "3rd time the flight was late"
Gatwick to Tromso via Oslo. This was the 3rd time I have flown with Norwegian and the 3rd time the flight was late. They made no announcements in the airport or during the flight telling you of delays. I missed my connecting flight which was due to the fact that they hadn't made support plans for people trying to get their connections. We had to collect our own luggage, re-check in and were told to run to the gate. Having missed the flight, me and a few others were told that our bags had been offloaded and there were no more flights that evening. It turns out the bags hadn't been offloaded and were on their way to my final destination. When I finally got to where I was going the next day, my bags weren't there. I had to wait another 12 hours for them to arrive. This was in August 2017 and I am still yet to hear back from my complaint despite multiple attempts to contact them. In their words, their complaints team are very busy. They only thing that they have going for them is they are cheap, but you get what you pay for.

### "This is a superb airline"
New York to Gatwick. I have flown across the Atlantic for over 25 years now and finding a good airline has become increasingly difficult. Norwegian is my airline of choice at this time. Value for money is hard to beat and considering they use the Boeing 787 for the JFK/LGW route, there isn't any other airline that can beat what they are offering in Premium Economy. If you book your ticket early, a premium economy ticket can be below $1,000.00 and that is for a fully refundable ticket. I have flow with Norwegian four times in Premium Economy. This is a superb airline with room for improvement in certain areas. Overall a great value.

### "took off approx 45mins late"
Gatwick to Barcelona. I could not log into the web site to add advanced passenger information. Boarding the plane at Gatwick was shoddily organized, I asked the lady at the gate check in if this was the correct place and was answered in an answered very curtly. We were then cattle penned into an area where we uncomfortably stood for about 15 mins. Why let us through so early when nothing was ready, we could have been sitting down. The aircraft took off approx 45mins late and not one word of apology. When we touched down in Barcelona there was no update on weather or change of time. I was told by my booking agent they requested an aisle seat as I had a bad back problem this was not actioned.

### "Great service, fair cost"
Stockholm to Helsinki. When you hear low cost in Europe you think no-frills, bad service, nickel and dime, etc. But Norwegian is none of those. Great service, fair cost, clarity upfront, brand new planes, punctuality, and I cam fo on. Particularly interesting is the fact that they have only general boarding and in spite of what other airlines do, this works very well. People seem to understand they have to hurry and move and it works!

### "this was impressive"
This was Norwegian's second flight to Singapore from Gatwick. I was travelling in Premium. Checkin was a breeze and I was checked in at the premium counter within a minute. Issued boarding card and voucher for the No 1 business lounge. Flight boarding was orderly and ready to go on time. ATC delayed us slightly but once in the air the service started. Good choice of alcoholic and soft drinks displayed on seat back screens and call button. Food was ok nothing special but tasty. Dinner was served and after lights turned down. The seat was great, it did go back far enough to allow for a semi decent sleep. Seat pitch 46 inches. Blankets and headsets given out. On this 12 hour 30 mins flight we were offered 2 meals and a chicken wrap half way through the flight. Staff are not walking up and down the plane in between service, but did respond to the call button immediately. Crew friendly and efficient. Inflight entertainment free and good choice. For a low budget airline this was impressive. Hoping my auction bid to be upgraded on the return leg is successful. Well done Norwegian.

### "we missed our flight"
Edinburgh to Providence. They changed the flight time from 1740 to 1715. We were so early for our flight that there was no gate for us to go, so decided to have dinner while we waited. Mistake made, never eat out of security point. Mistake two was not verifying the boarding pass. So we missed our flight. What did Norwegian do to help us out, nothing. We have to pay for another two tickets to an airport 2 hours away from home vs the 20 minutes we would have been originally causing us the rent a car ($$) and pay for a hotel room for the night because we couldn't get another flight until the next day. My concern is also that the airline knew we were on the premises and did nothing to make contact. When we get check in the person at the desk tell us that our bag is too heavy and need to pay $108 for the extra weight which was not a problem the day before. The only pro was the lady that handle issues took pity and only charged us $48.

### "lacklustre experience"
Palma to Gatwick. I had not used Norwegian for a few years and thought it was time to give them a try. I found the website logical and well set out and the terms and conditions were clear and concise. I arrived early to check-in and was delighted with the process and found the staff polite and efficient. My flight was after midnight and boarding was orderly and civil. I found that things were a mixed bag. The cabin crew were Italian and spoke in their own language ignoring passengers. The safety demonstration was not conducted with much sincerity. I had paid for my seat near the front and was dismayed when I saw passengers grab seats not assigned to them and the cabin crew did nothing to address this situation. The snacks on board were expensive and some options were not available. There was no route map and at no stage during the flight did the captain make any announcement. Very comfortable Boeing 737 with mood lighting. When I went to collect my luggage I noted that my bag had been interfered with as it was unzipped. I looked inside and saw that it had been disturbed. I made enquires with the Norwegian desk and was told to report it online. There was no sense of taking this issue seriously at all. Overall a lacklustre experience on this occasion.

### "should have just used a real airline"
I would be very careful booking with Norwegian. All the money you supposedly save will be made up for in time, trouble and additional money. The most basic of amenities are not available, could not check in online or transfer bags, so had to rush from a connecting flight after picking up my bags to recheck them, and even with paying extra baggage fees online in advance, was charged $90 for 6kg overweight even though they have some discretion, and only then told they don't work with TSA Precheck (another $100 down the tubes) and no, they wouldn't transfer my bags for the last leg so I'll have to claim and recheck in London too. I had also tried to call weeks in advance to ask some of these questions and was told the agents at the airport would help me. For the extra $200 and all the time wasted, I should have just used a real airline, and I recommend others do the same.

### "it was an advantageous trade off"
I was intrigued by the airline, the low fare and the new (to me) airport 70 miles upstate. So I decided to try it. I read up on Norwegian first before booking so that I will not have surprises of the unwanted variety. The plane was a 737-Max one class configuration of a 3+3. Departed on time and arrived at Edinburgh ahead of schedule. The return trip was essentially the same. Food - I did not order food. I packed my own. However, I saw the food others had ordered and it did not looked particulary appealing. They gave complimentary non alcoholic drinks. IFE - drop down screens every 4 (or 6, I forgot) seats. Showed some cartoons on the flight back. On the flight to EDI, I did not bother watching. Seats - are comfy enough. Leg space a bit small. If the seat in front reclines and you open your tray table, there would be little space left from your abdomen. Check in - no online check in. Have to do it at the counter. Check in opens exactly 3 hours before scheduled flight departure. Carry On baggage - on the way to Edinburgh, a lot of our baggages were weighed and a yellow tag placed that read "approved cabin baggage". Both my hand carry and carry on were weighed together. I was not concerned because I had weighed them to be less than 10 kg. and the sizes were well within their specifications. I made sure of that. On the way back, my luggage was neither weighed or tagged. That was most of us. A very few had tags. I understand that Norwegian is a LCC - low cost carrier. I also understand that LCC means less comfort and convenience. For me it was an advantageous trade off. The staff were no different from other airlines. Maybe a tad less smiling. I would recommend this airline with the caveat that you are aware it is an LCC.

### "seemed no end in sight"
I booked a flight in February 2017 for a trip in September 2017, a dream trip. First, there was the hour and half of standing in a long line to check-in and no kiosk check-in available. This was after hurricane Irma and spending five days without electricity or much in the way of food. The airport terminal was miserably hot. My flight was supposed to depart at 9:35pm and at 10:00pm, we had not begun to board the flight and no one from Norwegian was telling us why we were delayed. There seemed no end in sight. I finally gave up and asked them to remove my bag from the plane so I could get a cab and go home. I could not sit there any longer as hot and tired as I was. The sheer lack of courtesy was just insulting. I figured out they are a low fare airline, but they shouldn't get away with such things.

### "pretty much Business Class"
New York JFK to Paris return. They call it Premium Class but this product is pretty much Business Class. Flew JFK to CDG and back and had a pleasant experience and was treated extremely nicely by the Norwegian staff. Norwegian will get the timeliness corrected and then you will start to hear good things about it. I will gladly pay $1,500 USD for Norwegian Premium Class over a $200 Coach seat any day of the week.

### "business class at economy prices"
JFK to CDG and back in seat 1 E and 4 E. Do not believe the negative reviews. You are flying business class at economy fare prices. Wish this airline flew all over the world. All of the negative posters seem misinformed. For example, some mentioned that the foot rest is too short for a normal height person. Well there is a lever on the side of your seat which allows you to extend the foot rest, problem solved. Skip lines, board first, deplane first, use of airport lounges. Served meals, snacks, drinks, seat reclined so you can actually sleep. Everything I mentioned you cannot get in economy. All priced at coach fares.

### "to get such good service"
Copenhagen to Nice. Free cabin bag, free seat to choose, on time, cabin crew available and friendly. Food and drinks onboard very good quality and cheap particularly for the wine. I didn't expect for the cheap price of flight to get such good service. I usually don't like flights lasting more than 2 hours and this one was more than 3 hours. During the flights we could also watch TV, different programs.

### "Flight delayed by 4 hours"
Gatwick to Orlando. Flight delayed by 4 hours with no communication from ground staff. Delay occurred following our progression through the gate but before boarding so we were kept in the gate area with not enough seating and no food or drink for four hours. Staff on flight were rude and saw no need to provide any level of customer service. After flight it was clear that there had been a mix up with luggage but there was no one from the airline available to help, due to the delay it was now 2am and we were stranded without our luggage and no assistance. I called Norwegian helpline and informed them that my telephone credit was about to run out and requested they call me back but they refused to do so. Phone credit ran out and I was left with no way of contacting Norwegian and no suitcase. I emailed the airline with a complaint over a month ago and never received any kind of response. I'm sure they are fine if everything runs smoothly but as soon as there is an issue they are completely i equipped to deal with it.

### "over the weight limit of 10kg"
Gatwick to Los Angeles. Nickel and dime you to death. On my flight they forced me to check my bag because it was slightly over the weight limit of 10kg and charged me $55 -their price if you don't buy baggage in advance. Food I found revolting. $45. By the time they're done nickel & dime'ing you, your at the cost of the other airlines, just with horrible, aggressive, anti passenger service. They lure you with low fares, but then pursue you to squeeze every dime. An oppressive experience

### "very easy and straightforward"
Gatwick to New York JFK. If you want a cheap flight to the US and aren't bothered about the frills then book Norwegian. Both my flights were on time and both actually arrived earlier than planned. I didn't reserve a seat and got given aisle seats for both flights. I purposely booked a very early morning flight there (arriving in New York at 9am was great) and a late night flight back. This avoided needing to eat and all the other stuff. Everything was very easy and straightforward, just take plenty of water with you and a travel pillow. The only slight downfall was my headphones didn't fit the plane socket (I have the iphone lightning headphones so just take normal ones) other than that I was pleasantly surprised and would 100% fly with them again (although anything longer than 8hrs I would reconsider as I'm tall and legroom isn't great). The air on the Boeing 787 definitely makes a difference and I was surprised at how good I felt when I landed.

### "no cranberry or tomato juice"
I purchased a one way ticket on Norwegian for a direct flight from Gatwick to Denver. The original ticket was $303, paid for as soon as I booked it in June. Three days before the flight, Norwegian emailed me an offer to upgrade to premium economy for $450 which I accepted. I received a confirmation that I was being charged a cancellation fee and I was now being charged $779 (on top of the original $303). While this will get resolved I suspect now that I am back in the US, I was not overly impressed with this airline. In premium I asked for coffee and was told no, it would be served after the meal. I had to bus my own trash back to the kitchen - they did not come by with a trash bag to collect. I had to go to the kitchen several times to request water. In premium, there were two decent meals, but no cranberry or tomato juice.

### "Norwegian is a low cost airline"
I guess my mistake was not knowing that Norwegian is a low cost airline. My flight was certainly not considerably cheaper than others. The plane itself was fabulous. Huge, very roomy, clean, individual TVs for everyone with movies and USB ports for charging devices. The app  wouldn't allow my friend or me to check in online saying that check in needed to be done at a kiosk. Ok. I was on an 11 hour flight from London Gatwick to Oakland California with no  water. I didn't bother to pre-order a meal because I've never needed to with other airlines. I figured I'd get my complimentary drinks and snacks and that there would be plentiful options for meals onboard. While everyone around me was being served hot meals with tea and coffee and snacks, I sat there confused. When I asked if I could have some coffee the stewardess asked if I had prepurchased a meal. I had planned on purchasing food onboard the flight, but options were limited. The"hot snack was a grilled cheese with one thin slice of ham for $7. It tasted fine. The flight attendants rarely came by, twice I hit the call button and no one showed, but other parched passengers like myself were walking to the flight attendants station to ask for water which they were then provided a cup of room temp tap water. At least I had  movies to keep me occupied. Good luck if you get cold, need a pillow, or forgot your headphones because they will charge you. For the last short leg of my journey home I flew Southwest Airlines and  for my less than one hour flight from Oakland to Phoenix I had caring flight attendants and drinks and snacks.

### "service was efficient"
Kaunas to Stockholm. This flight apparently departed from Kaunas instead of Vilnius because of building works at Vilnius airport. For this reason a temporary departure hall had been added at Kaunas airport. It was not too bad, even though it felt very temporary. The most annoying thing was that when boarding started there was still lots of time until the actual boarding took place. So all the people, including the elderly and families with children who would have benefited the most from sitting had to stand waiting outside for a long time. Once we boarded the flight was short and smooth, and we arrived on time. In flight service was efficient, but somewhat overpriced, especially when departing from a cheap country like Lithuania. Like all Norwegian aircraft the plane was in good shape with decent seating comfort.

### "super service and latest planes"
Barcelona to Gatwick. After a disaster with Vueling caused by their delay we were able to book a flight on Norwegian the next day. What a surprise, super service and the latest planes, more legroom and tasty food. Flight left on time. Now our preferred airline. One complaint, they don't fly to Mahon but we can take advantage

### "fantastic friendly staff"
Gatwick to Barcelona return. My flight on the way to Barcelona was fantastic, they have friendly staff who were extremely caring, however on the way back I was shocked at how rude an air steward was boarding me to my seat, I'm a young teenager traveling alone to Barcelona and my seat was changed to an emergency exit seat, I wasn't told. He then said I was unorganised and that I should sit down because I'm blocking the aisle for other passengers. I was aware of other people around me who had also had problems with this man. This obviously doesn't mean everyone on Norwegian air is like this, they have fantastic friendly staff.

### "experience was very pleasant"
Oslo to Alesund. It was first time when i flew with Norwegian, and experience was very pleasant. Staff in Oslo airport was amazingly kind and helped us. Because our flight was delayed by more then 2 hours by Ryanair they kindly changed our flight for next day 1st flight to Alesund without extra charge, we were very surprised and it made our trip better. In Europe if i will have a choice of choosing whether Ryanair, Wizzair or Norwegian, I would definitely would choose Norwegian even if i would need to pay extra. Even tho i did not had much experience with them, I would recommend them to everyone

### "luggage overweight problem"
New York JFK to Gatwick. The line for check in was 4 lanes deep. At the counter I was met with a luggage overweight problem by 4 lbs. I transferred weight from one bag to the other but staff were not satisfied and I was still 1lb overweight. I have come to expect 50lbs, not 44 (20kg) as is their policy. Flying them once was enough for me.

### "wildly inconsistent with boarding practices"
Flew Norwegian from Copenhagen to New York JFK. This airline seems fantastic. They are low cost, but fly the newest jets. Nevertheless, they are wildly inconsistent with their boarding practices. I have flown several times with the airline. The last two times they let me take my certified luggage onboard. This time, however, they insisted that it was too big. Despite my protestations and citation of numerous examples where I had flown with the bag before, they told me I could not take it on the flight. They made me pay 64 Euros at the gate. This is absurd, because they didn't even measure my bag. Just told me that "I could take it or leave it. Unfortunately, an otherwise great airline is flawed in their selective boarding practices.

### "journey was very comfortable"
Flew Barcelona to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. The aircraft was very new. The journey was very comfortable. The staff at the airports were very kind, they let us change seats while checking in. The seats were very comfortable, Norwegian also offer wifi on-board which is very pleasant, so that you can still be in touch to check social networks, etc.

### "repeatedly delayed for 30 hours"
My flight from Los Angeles to London was repeatedly delayed for a total of 30 hours. Evidently, there was an electrical problem and the part needed to be flown in before they could make the repair. Norwegian "handlers" were rude and offered no help in getting a hotel. When asked a question, one of the handlers held up her hand and rudely said, "Hold your questions. They gave $7 food vouchers about 10 minutes before all of the concessions closed at LAX. I telephoned Norwegian's customer service and was hung up on several times, as were other travelers on the same flight. During the flight, they served the food that was stocked for the original flight. The steak was grey and completely inedible. The cabin crew basically turned off the cabin lights and hid in the galley for the flight. I missed my connecting flight, my hotel, my tour and had to rebook my connecting flight at a double the rate. It will take 6 months for Norwegian Air to reimburse me for these charges. My return flight was also delayed 2 hours while they repaired the pilot's handset microphone. My return flight was a completely different experience with lots of offers of water or juice during the flight and (although tiny portions) somewhat decent food. After 2 flights being delayed by repair issues, I believe Norwegian does not keep their planes in good repair. Yes, the leg room is abundant and the price lower than other airlines, but after this, I will never fly on Norwegian again.

### "an 8 hour flight and no movies"
Flew Norwegian from Edinburgh to Newburgh. The staff were lovely but come on, an 8 hour flight and no movies? For some reason some people got a meal and others didn't buy don't fret you can buy an overly priced sandwich or drink! Granted it was a cheap flight but I had gotten a better price on Air France with all the amenities of an international flight but purchased way earlier! Don't get me started on their so called international airport and Theo bus service to NYC, 45 minutes later we're still waiting to leave!

### "I would still recommend Norwegian"
Boston to Oslo, returning to New York JFK from Vilnius via Oslo. Fares for our return trip were much higher in USD than EUR or NOK, even with exchange rates and transaction fees considered. We paid 100USD less just by navigating their website in Norwegian (language) and paying in NOK. BOS to OSL: Check-in was smooth. Boarding was chaotic. Several lines formed from every direction at the gate and people needed to zipper in from each. The flight was fine. The large windows on the 787 are great. Food was nothing special and portions were small, relative to what other airlines offer. In-flight entertainment was good, but I feel like there could have been a bigger selection. It was odd some of the TV shows they offered only had 1 or 2 episodes. VNO to OSL: A long line had formed prior to check-in. 3 agents opened their kiosks with probably 50 people waiting. They opened check-in at the stated time, so not necessarily their fault. Boarding was more organized here. This was on a smaller jet, and offered WiFi, but had no IFE. The wifi was great and the flight passed quickly. OSL to JFK:  there are not many options past passport control in terms of food or shopping. Other passengers trickled in. We arrived at our gate a few hours early. The gate area was full, with people standing, when we were all informed that we needed to exit for a security sweep. This led to several lines forming outside of the gate where our passes were reviewed and people were randomly selected for security searches. Also at the gate, an Agent for Norwegian was forcing people with over-sized carry on to pay for it as baggage and gate check it. This happened to at least 10 people. Most of these bags had the approved carry on stickers (noticeably yellow with the Norwegian logo) and many of them argued that there were no issues on previous Norwegian flights. IFE was the same from our outbound flight, and the food wasn't any better. I would still recommend Norwegian, with disclaimers about their poor customer service and execution in certain areas, only because their routes+prices are highly favorable.

### "Waiting with low expectations"
On an evening flight from Athens to Stockholm Norwegian had to swap out the aircraft and the replacement was smaller than the original and a group of us were denied boarding. No issue here. Problems began after that. We were on a direct flight and eventually got booked on a flight the next day with an 8 hour layover although there was originally a direct flight available and even later flight options with 4 hour layovers. We were given a meal voucher only good at McDonalds. We were kept at the airport for 2 hours and booked on a 6.30 am flight meaning we got a maximum of 5 hours sleep assuming no time for shower. Called customer service as directed by gate agent who first denied any problem with flight, then told me it "wasn't possible" to book onto a better flight. I asked her why they wouldn't and she just kept repeating it "wasn't possible" and hung up on me. No compensation given at airport but instead directed to an online form. Online form didn't work and had to call customer service. Customer service had me fill out a general email feedback. Waiting with low expectations of ever getting compensation.

### "the service was very good"
Copenhagen to Ft Lauderdale. Very modern Boeing 787 is used on this route with comfortable seats and good entertainment. However, due to Norwegian being a low-cost carrier, there are no free blankets or pillows handed out to the passengers. They are available for purchase. The food was poor as well. There are additional snacks available for purchase. The cabin crew was very friendly and the service was very good.

### "Service onboard was quite good"
For some reason it was not possible to check in online, but the check in at the airport was very smooth with the machines, and there was an automatic bagdrop that worked well. Passengers in the rear of the plane were asked to board first, but since there was no extra checking of the boarding passes after the entrance to the waiting area some people of course did not care about that. But boarding went reasonably fast. The airplane was in good shape, a modern Boeing 737 and legroom was not too bad. Service onboard was quite good, even though it is a bit annoying to have to pay even for some water. It is also annoying that they do not accept cash payments. The wifi on board works well, and is free of charge. All in all, it is better than most low cost airlines, even though ticket prices are not always that low. It is also very nice that the cabin luggage limit is 10 kilos, but since it is hardly ever checked some people bring much more which sometimes can be a problem when the over head bins are full. I would also appreciated if the checked in luggage (for which you pay extra) would be 23 kilos instead of 20.

### "Plane was clean and comfortable"
Flew Los Angeles to Gatwick. Booked through Kiwi.com, got decent food on the way out but nothing on the way back. Apparently I should have ticked a box, but I didn't see one. Plane was clean and reasonably comfortable. Cabin crew weren't great though, they had a surly manner, and one was swearing within earshot of young kids.

### "we got to fly with Wamos"
New York to Oslo. We got notified just 3 days ago about our flight from JFK being operated by Wamos. We paid for Norwegian but we got to fly with Wamos (never heard of them before) at the last minute. That gave us no real opportunity to rebook our flight. Sure they notified us, but 3 days before departure means unaffordable tickets for a family of 4 adults and 1 baby. Onthe day of the departure, the flight got delayed by 3 hours, so instead of flying at 10pm, we flew at 1am. Worst experience ever. The flight back was the same - 3 hour delay and Norwegian did not want to reiumburse for anything.

### "delayed by 45 minutes"
Stavanger to Oslo. Flight delayed by 45 minutes. Somewhat cheap, but they take advantage of their customers. New planes and good tech. Often delayed and nothing is free onboard. Of my last 20 flights, 15 have been delayed. No information during such problems.

### "Good happy crew"
Madrid to Gatwick. My first trip on Norwegian and very good it was. New aircraft, clean environment and efficient and friendly crew. My ticket was ultra cheap and did not come with a seat reservation so I strongly suggest on-line check in as the flight was 100% full. Did not try wi-fi or F&B but both looked good from those using these facilities. Late to the desk meant free check-in for hand baggage too which is not bad considering. Would certainly fly again. Summing up - a clean fresh product. Good happy crew and informative (not overbearing) announcements. And some free drop-down screen kiddies entertainment.

### "no crew would place my suitcase"
Gatwick to Palma de Mallorca. Extremely disappointed about my flight with Norwegian. Most previous flights with Norwegian had been pleasant but the service I was offered was unacceptable. When I entered the plane, no crew would place my suitcase in the overhand locker. They wouldn't let me pay my snack in euros unless I was to spend 9 euros just for a bag of chips and a muffin. The thing that was good was the Wifi for I am writing my review in the plane.

### "very poor experience"
Wife and I flew Norwegian on their premium flex cabin from LAX to Stockholm return. This will be the last time as we had a very poor experience in both inbound and outbound flights. The crew never showed up after two poor meals. Flight was late arriving. And the cherry on the cake being packed so tight on their bus and drove around some more around the LAX tarmac. The way up was even worse due to a 4 hour delay. I paid more in flex ($2100 per ticket) that I would have paid with other airlines. I regret my decision.

### "no ground staff to assist"
Los Angeles to Gatwick. A flight booked months in advance and then subsequently upgraded to Premium. Never mind that it was an additional £100 to upgrade over the phone due to the service not working properly online. Checking previous flights for the past few days - all OK, on time. Great. Get to the lounge early - OneWorld - excellent facilities and a perfect way to start our journey. Then the texts started coming. From a 2010 expected take-off Saturday, the short story is a delay until 0200 Monday. The key issue was having no ground staff to assist passengers, leading to a fair amount of emotion, uncertainty and pain in arranging own hotels, flights etc. Again, no doubt great when it goes well but with no network and no support, be aware that the costs come with a caveat that you are on your own should there be any issues. Our little bit of luxury missed and likely not to be repeated again.

### "subbed onto a EuroAtlantic 777"
Gatwick to New York. Apparently when Norwegian get it right, they are excellent. Sadly we haven't had chance to see this in action yet. We were subbed onto a EuroAtlantic 777 which was over 20 years old and extremely cramped. The crew were fairly staid - not really caring given they're on a contract. Food was average, in-flight non existent. No entertainment at all (text said "limited"). It was either suck it up or pay three times more to change the flight a matter of a day or so beforehand.

### "very happy overall"
Hartford to Edinburgh return. I was very happy overall with the flight both ways. I had never flown Norwegian before but they exceeded my expectations. From check-in to landing, it was flawless. On the overnight leg to Edinburgh there was very little service but on the return leg, you had plenty of opportunity to purchase snacks/drinks. One ding on score for me were the seats. I had enough room pitch-wise (6' tall) but i had trouble getting comfortable to sleep (more in the neck area). I think a neck pillow would solve most of it but that is probably the only negative part of the review. Overall, very happy. Value was tremendous at 300 return. Flight was on time and easy to travel between two small airports. Just be prepared - if you don't bring on food you need to order meals ahead of time - most people brought food and drinks on board. It is like flying Southwest Airlines to Europe. Other pointers: We didn't pay for seat assignments but they kept us together (family of 5 with 3 kids). Pay attention to the weight restrictions. 10kg on carry on, 20kg checked bag (we did do one checked bag). This particular flight did not have outlets to charge devices, bring a battery back up if you need entertainment. Free wi-fi but no good if you have no juice.

### "don't bother upgrading"
Gatwick to New York return, both flights operated by EuroAtlantic Airways aircraft. Don't bother upgrading your ticket. We paid the upgrade price to be guaranteed our selected seats, get a meal & snack, have a free carry-on bag and checked luggage. The first issue arose when our flight was delayed by almost 24 hours and no one representing Norwegian would help. When it was time to board our flight, we discovered that the upgrades we paid for were in actuality free for everyone because the flight had been delayed. The upgrades were being given away free on the return flight, which was on time. On both flights, they moved our (paid for) seats back 30+ rows in into the middle of the plane (we paid for window / aisle side seats). The entertainment did not work and there was no wifi. The seats were incredibly cramped, which was not fun for an 8-hour flight. The flight attendants did not care about providing us with service beyond the meal and snack. My row was skipped at drink service, and when I asked for water I  never got it. Don’t bother wasting your money or trying to contact a non-existent customer service.

### "pieces each about 3kg over"
Gatwick to Oakland. I was tolerant of some of deficiencies in other areas, however the rude service we received at the gate on our return home was unacceptable. The luggage weighing as we came to the gate was at the very least tacky. Our pieces were each about 3kg over, I explained that we had with us what we had when we flew Norwegian out 1 week prior. The representative did not care what happened when we took the first leg of trip, that was not her job. In her words everyone who was over the permitted luggage allowance had to pay extra. Needless to say, she charged us the equivalent of $150 for being over. Her attitude and disregard bothered me even more than the charge.

### "return flight was cancelled"
Edinburgh to Providence. Our return flight was cancelled only hours before with no explanation. When we called the helpline number given to us, we waited 45 minutes before speaking to anyone. They asked one question and then passed us on to another line where we were put on hold again - and only Norwegian was spoken. After another 30 minutes on hold, we gave up and booked other flights back to UK at a huge cost. There was no other way to contact the airline or receive assistance or get more information. I will never fly this budget airline again. Our flight from Edinburgh to Providence was not enjoyable. We expected it to be a budget airline for a long haul flight, but to not be offered water and to not have fully functioning wi-fi made it unbearable.

### "premium passengers board before my wife"
Madrid to Copenhagen. It is absurd that they let premium passengers board before my wife, who is six months pregnant, and they asked us to wait. The ticket appears cheap, but if you add extras (eg. food & beverage or baggage) you realise that you may be better off booking another airline.

### "Seats and leg space were barely adequate"
First time with Norwegian so I didn't know what to expect. Flew from New York City to Copenhagen. Clean new plane that felt more spacious than other widebodies and very quiet for a twin engine on takeoff and cruising. I didn't go for the preordered meal but had a hot sandwich, it was ok. Seats and leg space were barely adequate. Cabin crew was fine but they don't need to do so much. IFE was quite nice, not as big a screen as on other 787s but good resolution and good selection of movies and shows. Good ontime performance for my flight. Overall I can see how the business model makes sense and I would go with them again for the right price.

### "staff nice and friendly"
Norwegian is the airline I use the most. I am always satisfied, the planes are on time, staff nice and friendly, the planes comfortable and clean. The flight to Budapest was no exception, wifi worked just fine, all on time, the waiting time for boarding absolutely reasonable, I could not complain. Flying Norwegian, you won't feel treated in a low-cost way as you may with some other airlines, the cabin luggage allowed is about everything you need, they never go as low as to measure the bags or even weigh them, there is plenty of room anyway.

### "could not be less helpful"
The flight from Santorini was part of a package Holiday. It was a late night flight. Despite other airlines still taking off this flight was cancelled because of adverse weather conditions. Instead of taking off at 23.55 we left at approximately 17.00. On return to UK Norwegian could not be less helpful. They refuse to enter into any dialog about their decision and the reasoning behind it.

### "the flight was cancelled"
A one hour delay out of Oakland which caused a missed connection in Stockholm en route to Oslo. Service onboard was ok. The movie selection is basic. I knew that the food cost extra coming into the flight, so didn't really have sympathy for people complaining that they didn't get meals. No complaints except the choices were both more than moderately spicy. I like that, but my daughter didnt. The return flight from Oslo to San Francisco was a fiasco. The plane arrived late, then had to go through maintenance. 2.5 hours after initial departure time, plane was cleared, we boarded, and the announcement came: mechanical difficulty. So we deplaned, went through customs (given food vouchers that didn't cover a sandwich and drink) and told another plane was coming out of the hanger and would take awhile to be serviced. This took us to four hours after initial departure. Then the time was delayed another 1/2 hour for reasons unknown. All this was sent with update texts. That's when the flight was cancelled. No reason and the text only said delayed. I have to guess that the crew was timed out. This was now 6.5 hours after initial departure time. Differing instructions on what to do appeared: get luggage, go to the counter and wait. There was also the promise of hotel vouchers, luggage was not at the belt, so people walked out of the secure area to follow directions to go to the counter, and later had to be escorted back in to get their luggage. No vouchers were forthcoming. Staff told customers they had to find their own accommodations back in Oslo. People had the option of rebooking through Stockholm or Barcelona. Only a few In the know knew to ask. There was no mention of a rescheduled flight. I opted for LAX. A hotel and transportation were provided, after midnight. the only information being provided that it was a two hour bus ride away. The only further information was that "there would be more information" at 8 am the next morning.

### "We will fly with them again"
New York JFK to Dublin via Oslo and for such a long trip we didn't want to be cramped in economy. We really didn't want to spend over $4,000 for airfare. We found Norwegian. Haven't flown them before we were a little skeptical but gave it a shot. We flew New York JFK to Dublin return via Oslo, plus the same return route. The Oslo/Dublin route had us in economy because there wasn't any other cabin class. It was a short hop so no big deal. The attention we were given was great in Premium Class. Even the Alitalia lounge at JFK was great. We almost made it to the Oslo lounge but due to the security routine they have in place there, the time between flights was just a little short. The entertainment system was also excellent. The seat was comfortable plus that 46 inches of leg room. Being allowed the extra baggage plus the other extras was well worth the money. All flights were virtually on time, just a few minutes of delay. We will fly with them again. We hope they will fly out of more cities in the US

### "Very happy with everything"
Gatwick to Bergen. Scandinavian efficiency, a fair price and punctual service. This was a delightfully egalitarian experience. Nothing lacking, on time and clean enough. Recomended without hesitation from Gatwick. At Gatwick they run efficient services too. Very happy with everything - nothing five star but all awesome.

### "the stress of delays"
Gatwick to Copenhagen. 6 journeys in 3 years, yesterday the latest. Changes each time, either in advance or on the day. The savings are not worth the stress of delays or a flight moved from early afternoon to morning. Lufthansa and SAS both fly to Copenhagen via Heathrow, they cost 20-30% more but in terms of stress and inconvenience are worth it.

### "a really nice experience"
I took an early flight (08.00) from Stockholm to Amsterdam. Although Norwegian is a low cost airline, it didn't felt like that at all. Boarding process was efficient, crew helped everyone with a (genuine) smile, and made some small talk with passengers. Seats were comfortable, and even though I'm 1,93m the leg space was OK. Food and drinks on board were a bit expensive (but in line with Scandinavian prices). However, flight was 2 hours, so you don't need much during the flight. They serve some great orange juice for a fair price. Overall a really nice experience.

### "very disappointed with their service"
I had a 9 hour over-night flight with Norwegian and was very disappointed with their service. The plane was incredibly cold and we were not provided with blankets or pillows, and when I asked for anything that could keep me warm as I was shivering they said the only option was to buy a blanket for $7. As my flight was part of a 3-part journey (I travelled from Managua to Fort Lauderdale with another airline, then Fort Lauderdale to Copenhagen and Copenhagen to Gatwick with Norwegian Air), I was not given the option to choose food online, nor was I told that we needed to select which meal we wanted. Everyone around my friend and I were served food, and when we asked the air hostess why we were not given any she told us it was because we had opted out of having food, so they could not serve us anything - not even a drink, even though all food and drink was free and included in the flight ticket. The next morning, the same thing happened, and I had an argument with the same air hostess who would not even give us a cup of coffee even though there was plenty to spare. We had been travelling for 35 hours and had no food or drinks, but she insisted she couldn't give us a cup of coffee otherwise "everyone on the flight could have one". Yes, everyone on the flight should get a cup of coffee if they want one. The airline even has a video explaining how they believe that if their customers "don't want something, they don't have to pay for it. - examples included checked-in luggage and coffee on the flight. Yes, Norwegian Air, if I don't have luggage to check-in and don't want an extra coffee, then like every airline in the world, I shouldn't have to pay for it, but starving your passengers because your online food booking system didn't work, especially when the food is free anyway, does not count as a customer not wanting something and not having to pay for it. I will definitely never be using their service again.

### "given wrong information"
Helsinki to Malaga. We were given wrong information about my baby pushchair. They didn't allow me to take it to the gate but I read on internet that it is allowed. We went to the airport the day before travelling to ask this question and they said that yes we can take the pushchair to the gate. The airport agents at Helsinki Airport addressed me rudely and impolite at baggage drop off.

### "recommend Norwegian readily"
Gatwick to Los Angeles. As a family travelling with a nearly two year old daughter, this was the first time we had flown long haul. Norwegian were significantly cheaper than the next best flight deal and a fraction of the cost of noted major airlines. We wondered where was the catch? We flew London Gatwick to Los Angeles and then returned Oakland to Gatwick two weeks later, after driving up the Californian coast to see family. Norwegian were clean, efficient and on the whole very good. Yes it's a budget airline and there were no free blankets or monogrammed earphones but we didn't need that, who does? It's not like flying Business on a big name airline but it is a fraction of the price, so what are you expecting? Norwegian were comparable, cheaper and perhaps even better than most other airlines I have flown with in economy class. Even the Premium seats looked good and seemed pretty good value compared to business on other airlines. It was a new aircraft (Boeing 787), in a clean condition with a pretty good entertainment system that contained a fairly large section of movies, games and TV programmes. As a parent the cabin crew were mostly polite to us and our daughter. Luckily we secured a bank of three seats (there and back) and our daughter slept for most of the journey (worth planning the times of flights to coincide with sleep times as that helps). As an under two you don't have to pay for a seat for them, but that does mean they are supposed to stay on your knee the whole journey (and no food is provided for them). Had we not had the extra seat that would have been tricky, but that is not an issue with Norwegian but travelling with a toddler! I would say that if you are travelling with an active under two, that it might be worth paying the money for an extra seat, as long haul with a nearly two year old child on your lap might be a terrible experience or chance it like we did and hope to get lucky with a spare seat. The catch? None that we could see and we would recommend Norwegian readily. By offering budget long haul with similar benefits to a regular economy flight, Norwegian might make other big name airlines re think their pricing strategy.

### "customer service lines closed on a Sunday"
This airline is terrible. In taking a simple flight from London Gatwick to Stockholm Arlanada, they managed to delay both my flight out and returning. The customer service lines are also closed on a Sunday, which is interesting because they certainly fly on Sundays so if there is an issue you are on your own. The big issue is the delay (over 3 hours) placed the flight in at 3 am which means there are little to no trains in and I had work in the morning. This airline service is disgusting and I will never fly again. They can't operate well and they don't even have the customer service to remedy their mistakes.

### "thank you all for everything"
New York to Stockholm on the 8th May 2017. Beside all the good things, price, time and allowing luggage, the service and the care I got from the crews was more than good. As soon as they noticed how scared I was from flying they gathered around me surrounding me with peace and made my fear go away. They offered me talk, relaxing tea and love and I'm so glad that I got these angels with me. Thank you all for everything you did with me that day and I can't wait to go back home next week and hope I will see you again.

### "best airline I've ever flown"
Manchester to Alicante. First time I have ever flown with Norwegian and all I can say best airline I've ever flown with. Staff very pleasant food good and best of all wifi makes a massive difference when travelling alone. I will definitely be looking at this airline to be my first choice to fly with in the future. Excellent.

### "aircraft was changed to WAMOS Air"
I usually don't leave reviews as I'm not a fussy person when traveling however my experience with Norwegian was not good. Firstly, on travelling from London to New York our aircraft was changed to WAMOS Air which had no inflight entertainment. We questioned this when we checked in and the lady said we do have TVs but they are limited, she also said there was phone chargers available on the flight but there wasn't. We asked for four of us to be seated together, she said this was sorted however when we got on the flight two of the seats were together but the other two seats were taken up by two other women and they had the same number seats as us. Me and my friend were then seated at opposite sides of the plane. It was an 8 hour flight and we checked in early to ensure we could be seated together. Not satisfied with this, the return flight was worse. In New York I hurt my ankle and could not walk, again on checking in (please note I was in a wheelchair, also holding my crutches) I asked to be seated in the exit seats or a seat with room to rest my leg. The staff member said this would be possible however I was seated on the outside lane in seat 20 D with no leg room, I stressed how much I needed the room to keep my leg up incase of swelling however he didn't listen to me. During the flight I asked the air hostess if someone could swap with me but they said no that the flight was full and they couldn't help me. There should have been some alternative for these situations.

### "budget airline with a little class"
Stockholm to London Gatwick. An excellent choice if your looking for a budget airline with a little class. The staff are helpful, the leg space is adequate even for people of 6ft+ like me. The layout and design is basic yet doesn't look budget unlike some airlines. It has in built free wifi which is rare for many budget airlines to have. Both my flights to and from Sweden were on time with no delays and were quick to depart. The seats were also fairly comfortable with decent back support. To be honest not many bad points worth mentioning at all its a cheap way to get around by air so Norwegian it does the job and certainly does it better than some other airlines.

### "a lot cheaper than alternatives"
First time I have flown with Norwegian. Booked flights from London Gatwick to New York JFK only a couple of months in advance and they were a lot cheaper than alternatives, had generally solid reviews and were using new Being 787 aircraft. Received text week before to inform flights being operated by Wamos. I believe this was due to maintenance issues with original aircraft and read of similar issues over the previous 4-5 weeks. We ended up on 20 year old aircraft with no inflight entertainment. All customers were served food as a sort of compensation, however since we originally paid for food there was no benefit to us. Service was generally poor, most announcements were in Spanish and flight attendants didn't really seem to care about any passenger requests or needs. It may be a temporary issue with aircraft/service, however were I to travel long haul again I would pay the extra for guaranteed decent flight.

### "the most appalling customer service"
Flew from New York JFK to London Gatwick. The most appalling customer service from Norwegian. They have been using Wamos Air instead of their own Dreamliner planes and consequently they are smaller planes. We booked Premium but on the smaller plane there are only 24 Premium seats compared to the 35 on a Dreamliner. Despite reconfirming our reserved premium seat numbers 5 mins before entering the airport, when we arrived at check in we were told that our seats had been allocated to someone else and had been down graded to economy. On speaking to the duty manager at JFK check in, he explained that Norwegian had been doing this for the past month, had known well in advance of the problem but choose just to cause maximum distress by downgrading at check in. Absolutely disgraceful and can only advise - do not fly Norwegian long haul.

### "went above and beyond"
Los Angeles to Gatwick. My son, (aged 13), few solo, long haul from Los Angeles to London. We did not pay an unaccompanied minor fee, however, from check-in to landing, Norwegian Airlines went above and beyond to make my sons journey safe, comfortable and more the point enjoyable. On check-in, (without my motivation), they radio'd ahead to tell airport staff to look for my son to ensure safe and easy boarding. When on the plane an air host, throughout the flight, took care of his well being ensuring he had food and water, while asking about the film he was watching. The airline staff created an air of being taken cared for without being invasive. This is not the first time I have been impressed with Norwegian and therefore felt compelled to share a extremely positive flying experience.

### "terrible organisation"
Gatwick to Catania with Norwegian. Delayed over 3 hours at Gatwick due to late crew. No explanations, terrible organisation then made sure they sped up and arrived at just under the 3 hour limit by literally minutes to avoid claims. Helpfully we were delayed on the way back also.

### "Norwegian is easy"
I frequently fly to Europe from LA every month and a half, and always choose Norwegian. They are the equivalent of Southwest in a European, low-cost carrier. It's super easy to fly with them, with their cheap prices and ease of changing flights. I always fly economy and buy the package of a bag and a meal, and I find it to be very comfortable. With their friendly staff and easy check-in, I've never had any problems with Norwegian. The food is decent (you get what you pay for), but their in-flight entertainment system is excellent, on my flight to London from LAX in March they already had LaLa Land! They have plenty of movies and shows to keep you entertained for hours, and on the short flight from London to Helsinki they had free wifi. Since I'm a frequent flier I usually check-in 2 bags (sports equipment), and have never had a problem. I also change my return date frequently since my schedule is always changing, and have only had to pay 90 euros to 100 euros, but never more than that. Plus I'm a Norwegian rewards member so I get cashpoints for flights, hotels and lounge access, which you can apply towards any flight right away (no needing to wait until you get 30k points to use towards a flight, you can use it instantly). Either I can wait a couple months and get a couple hundred dollars off, or I can use it the next month and get $20 off. Norwegian is easy and I'll continue to fly with them.

### "changed the season's schedule"
Norwegian previously provided reasonably reliable service, so we booked our year's schedule of flights, in advance. Big mistake. Norwegian have now changed the season's schedule, after bagging all their bookings, Their flights back into Gatwick from Fuerteventura on both Wednesday and Saturday's now arrive at around 2am. Great inconvenience for our onward travel plans and not what we paid in advance for. Norwegian Customer Service were not interested in the fact that both our car hire and travel tickets needed to be rebooked (at a cost). Add to this that the advertised benefit of onboard Wifi hasn't worked on all our last two or three flights. We will switch our future bookings onto Easyjet.

### "cheap prices and friendly staff"
Nice to Copenhagen. New planes, cheap prices and friendly staff, but often delayed. The later your plane is scheduled, the more likely the delay. In Nice, the passengers sitting in the back of the plane are asked to board first, which is a usual procedure. What is unusual, is that there seems to be a discrepancy between the possible number of passengers and the available hand luggage space, despite a restrictive hand luggage policy. That may cause annoyance when the flights are heavily booked. If you plan to sit in the front seats because you want to get off the plane quickly after landing, the staff may not allow you to take hand luggage with you because of lack of space. That may cost you a delay for getting your bag back after landing (30 mins in Copenhagen). Good for recreational purpose, annoying for frequent flights.

### "changing our reservation"
We had to cut our trip to Guadeloupe four days early which necessitated changing our reservation. We tried to reach a customer representative through the international and U.S. telephone numbers. We were on hold for hours and finally gave up until later in the day (March 11). Our travel document stated we could go to the Norwegian.com website and change our reservation under "My Reservations. Although we provided our booking reference number, document number, passenger name, flight, etc, the website stated they had no such reservation. Later that day, we again tried to reach Norwegian by phone. This time we were connected to a customer representative, rude to say the least. We had to pay $480 to change the reservation for two tickets, including $50 to have him make the change online. He said we could avoid the $50 fee by doing this ourselves online, but when he told him we were unable to make the change online, he said we would have to pay the $50 for him to change the reservation.

### "€11 kg for suitcase being overweight"
Shocking charge of €11 per kg for your suitcase being overweight. I am a frequent flyer with Norwegian and this is the first time my baggage has been overweight, but they refused to take this into consideration. It's the last time I will fly with Norwegian as this is the last straw with a company with whom I have recently encountered many problems.

### "they've been horrendous for customer service"
I was due to fly to New York JFK from Gatwick aboard a Norwegian Airbus but received a text a few days before departure telling me that the flight would be operated by HiFly and that the inflight entertainment would be limited. Nothing about food comfort or anything. As soon as I got on board the discomfort started. Thin uncomfortable seats. Tiny TV with only 6 terrible films. Not that it mattered as my headphone socket was broken. I'd paid extra for the food upgrade (£50 each way). The food was as basic as you get. I've seen better school dinners than this food. We were provided 1 drink only. I asked for another and even offered to pay but was refused and told rather rudely "Only water!". On an 8 hour flight. When it came to attempting to sleep my seat didn't even recline. Along with that there was a wobble to it as though it wasn't screwed down correctly. The staff were hardly ever around and never seemed to answer the service light. There was also a constant 'bong' noise like when the pilot communicates to the staff. This was constant the entire flight every few minutes making any rest impossible. To make all this worse I was flying back the next day. Looking forward to a slightly better flight. The morning of my departure I received the same text which said my flight later that evening would also be managed by the same company! To my horror it wasn't just that. It was exactly the same crew meaning Norwegian knew well in advance that my flight would be this one but deemed it ok to not tell me until the morning of my flight, stopping me having a chance to change it. Since then I've had back and forth with them over email. They've offered me 1000 Casahpoints/Airmiles voucher. Which equates to about £96. No refund on the food upgrade I purchased. Just a means I can only use if I fly with them again. They've been horrendous for customer service. An apology for misselling me a ticket and a small voucher is ridiculous. There are a lot of others who have clearly had good service on their flights when they work. Just beware that when they don't you're probably going to have a really really bad time.

### "flight conducted by Hi-Fly"
Gatwick to New York JFK. A week before departure received an email stating that the flight will be conducted by Hi-Fly (not Norwegian). I had hotels booked and a car waiting for me so the opportunity to rebook or cancel was not an option. There were 6 films to choose from (total) but it didn't matter anyway because apparently they had forgotten to load the headphones. The seats were no better than economy, and although the seat recline was in the region of 60 degrees there was insufficient room to relax, I had booked premium class because my wife suffers from a slipped disk in her spine. Broken magazine pouches, and tears in the seating fabric lent nothing to the overal comfort. No small comfort items toothpaste, brush, eye mask etc. The two meals was served in a cardboard box with limited choice, yuck. I appreciate that airlines need on occasions to uterlise alternative aircraft (leasing) but come on. When at Gatwick airport and you observe several Norwegian aircraft to European destinations questions, you ask as to why a long haul flight to the USA was serviced with an aircraft so old an clearly not suitable for those who have paid a great deal of money for a semblance of comfort which was sorely missing in this trip. I'm not looking forward to the trip home.

### "certainly recommend Norwegian"
Bergen to Gatwick. Punctual; service was on time with informative updates provided by the flightdeck crew. Aircraft new and very fuel efficient. Comfortable; the cabin was fitted with next generation seating with extra legroom and comfort. Cabin interior was new, modern and looked after. Friendly, welcoming and helpful staff; staff were there to help and assist but never overwhelming. I sensed they had pride in their job. On the flight one of our cases was overweight but no additional charge was made, because our total baggage allowance (hold+cabin) was not exceeded, which meant that we didn't have to do any on the spot repacking. Good value for money - flights were booked within about 3 weeks of departure and were still very good value. Open ticket return was also easy to book and easy to change on line app. Booking: booking was made online and was very simple and straightforward. The on-line app was also extremely easy to use and very useful in that electonic boarding passes could be used. Excellent inflight wifi connectivity with access to films and free programs. I would certainly recommend Norwegian and would definitely consider using them on other routes.

### "Nothing bad to tell"
Tromso to Nice via Oslo. First time I fly with Norwegian but certainly not the last. Nothing bad to tell about this company. So many destinations at a great value price. Food on board is affordable. We had a little delay with our flight from Tromso but there was blizzard that delayed all the flights at this airport.

### "wouldn't say its good value"
Gatwick to New York JFK. The worst airline experience I have had. The flight was delayed 5 hours and we were not given anything to make up for it. On boarding the flight I pulled back the seat pouch to put my book in, and the plane had clearly not been cleaned. I asked the air hostess to clear the mess, she rolled her eyes and replied "I guess I could do that". I was sat next to quite a heavily pregnant woman, there were cabin staff stood in the entrance who could see this pregnant woman struggling to get her bag into the overhead bin yet not one of them offered to help her. They then later denied her request for a glass of water because the snack bar was not open. They would not let her go to the toilet when there was turbulence. Appalling customer care. I wouldn't say its good value for money once you've had to pay for extras such as luggage and food.

### "Smartlynx fly A320's"
Copenhagen to Stockholm. I'm a frequent Norwegian flyer, and have for a long time liked it a lot. It seems like Norwegian outsource many of their flights to Smartlynx Airlines, and it is terrible. Today the plane is delayed 1.5 hours. That is unacceptable. Smartlynx Airlines fly A320's instead of Norwegian new Boeings and that means the boarding can only happen from the front (so it takes twice as ling and gets the arrival even more delayed), there is less luggage room in the cabin (so they have to check in last minute extra luggages, which delays the process) and there is no wifi on the plane.

### "modern, clean and comfortable"
❎ Unverified |  Gatwick to Berlin. Originally 09:00 flight. Time changed with more than enough notice, offered many different options for new flights for free or full refund for the leg. Check-in was quick and easy, as was boarding. Aircraft was modern, clean and comfortable, although the crew lacked any personality and seemed almost perturbed to be doing their job. Very ordinary flight. Berlin to Barcelona and then Gatwick, 09:00 22/07/16. Again, originally a direct flight at 12:40 from SXF-LGW. Offered a refund, but we opted for a free of charge change of flights as it was cheaper. Flight SXF-BCN delayed by 3 hours. Ground staff very helpful, allowed us to call parents in the UK to discuss plans. Told we could fly to BCN, miss our connection and would offer us accommodation and onward travel to LGW for free, although this option was not satisfactory for us. We offloaded and requested a refund for the leg we did not use. Full refund of inbound leg within 4 weeks of submission. Very impressed.

### "Delayed by nearly 5 hours"
New York JFK to Gatwick. Delayed by nearly 5 hours and abandoned at the airport, the last flight out. Shops shut. Food vouchers of insufficient value not accepted in all outlets. Sought explanation from airline who advised extraordinary circumstances and no compensation. I was unable to establish why they could not have resolved the issue within a reasonable time. Didn't want to make a fuss but their attitude to my complaint made me more mad!

### "need to check our hand luggage in"
London Gatwick to Stockholm. All three flights so far wih Norwegian has run smoothly. But this flight D82852 on February 8 was sinking the rating of Norwegian as we entered the cabin. The crew was disorganised and there was not enough space overhead for the cabin luggage. Either Norwegian hasn't designed the aircraft to fit all cabin luggage in the cabin or they are not making sure that people stick to the rules of carrying hand luggage. So we came in to our pre-booked front seat rows and find that the overhead storage isn't designed for normal sized cabin luggage and already there is one smaller bag and a ladies handbag stuffed in there. The cabin staff tells me to follow her colleague further back to store my luggage there. Another staff says there is no room for our luggage down there. When I finally get back to my seat the staff confirms they need to check our hand luggage in. I need to take out my laptop and our valuables. After takeoff I realise that the luggage stored overhead of us belongs to the cabin crew. I have to admit that yesterday's flight from Fuerteventura to London with a half full cabin did have one of the smoothest communicating crews I have seen in work lately.

### "a good experience all round"
❎ Unverified |  Flew from London Gatwick to New York JFK on 2nd February. Check in was no problem. There were attendants stationed to help you use the check in machine. Boarding was done certain sections at a time to ensure we were not all boarding at once. Took off on time. Entertainment was via screens and plenty of choice of selection. Booked pre flight meal and it was very nice. Also provided with tea and coffee together with cold drinks. Attendants were great and very helpful. Flight was a good experience all round and would definitely use them again.

### "I cannot fault their service"
Manchester to Malaga. Don't believe everything you read. I was ready for a horrible journey before I entered the plane as one of the ground crew insisted that he had been told by the flight crew that there was "No available space in the overhead lockers and my bag would have to go in the hold". So he took my bag, after I retrieved my laptop computer and put a label on it. I was shocked to find that the plane was only a third full and there was plenty of overhead locker space. I asked one of the hostesses and she said there wouldn't have been a problem at all and didn't understand. I sat down in my very comfortable seat with plenty of legroom and prepared for the flight. The flight was one of the best short-haul flights I've had for many years. The flight crew were pleasant and chatty and nothing was too much bother. The food and drinks were reasonably priced and the free wifi worked a dream. I even managed to make a whatsapp call to my wife during the flight. I realised the Ground crew were not Norwegian Air but Manchester Airport's own staff. This was proved to be right when I collected my bag at Malaga which was one of only 5 on the baggage collection conveyor. The ground crew were obviously making sure that the baggage handlers jobs were justified. I cannot fault their service and will not only use them again but also recommend them. Ground services are marked down to 1 star as this is down to the airport and not the airline.

### "on time and very comfortable"
Gatwick to Budapest. The flight was on time, and very comfortable. Before we left the cabin staff had trouble closing the overhead locker so I helped her and she was very grateful. When I ordered my meal she gave me free drink for helping her. I was also allowed go into the cockpit after landing. Very good, recommended.

### "definitely fly Norwegian again"
❎ Unverified |  London Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale with Norwegian. Really impressed with our flight. No delays. Cabin crew were very professional. Ordered snacks and drinks on a tablet , everything Really quick and efficient. Plenty of films to watch and trivia games to play. The overnight flight back to London was comfortable, the lights were dipped so everyone could get some sleep. Will definitely fly Norwegian again.

### "just over a 3 hour delay"
London Gatwick to Tenerife. It was our first time flying with this company because Thomson are now using this airline in their package holidays. We had just over a 3 hour delay, kept at the gate with no explanation or beverages. After a couple of hours we were told that the plane was ready but there was no crew. Once we were airborne,  everyone was in need of a drink and something to eat but by the time the crew got to the middle of the plane there was no food left. By this time tempers were frayed and a lot of people were upset. The experience was awful.

### "an excellent flight"
❎ Unverified |  London Gatwick to Orlando. This is our first time flying with Norwegian and we would thoroughly recommend the airline. We chose premium at what we considered to be a competitive price and were impressed with the Boeing 787, the comfortable seats and ample legroom. The inflight meal was pretty good for airline food and the IFE was very user friendly. All in all an excellent flight - in fact the only long haul flight where I haven't been clock watching!

### "flew premium and it was wonderful"
Fort Lauderdale to Paris CDG. My wife and I flew premium and it was wonderful. Separate line for check in. Food and service were excellent. Seats show signs of wear and it does not appear that all isle seats in the center section have access to an oprtational overhead bin above their seats. Gate check in was somewhat disorganised as it did not appear premium. Premium baggage came off last and no lounge at FLL. US legacy carriers should take note of the cost, the offering, one way fare cost, which they charge over the round trip fee for, and the other US options to excessive fares from Atlanta and other examples to CDG. There are other options now.

### "unimpressed with the service"
Gatwick to Madrid. I recently travelled with Norwegian for the first time and was unimpressed with the service. They weighed hand luggage at the gate and if it was overweight they took it off them and charged to put it in the hold. I was allocated seat 32c when there were only 31 rows on the aircraft - the stewardess didn´t have a solution so I had to obstruct until everyone had boarded until I could pick a seat. I thought there was little space between the rows of seats. We were supposed to land in terminal 2, but they left us in terminal 1 without warning us beforehand.

### "good airline until things go wrong"
Oslo to Lonyearbyen. A good airline until things go wrong. And when they go wrong, you may pay a lot of money or waste a lot of time. Norwegian use a lot of contractors for ground service, where passenger issues are dealt with by contractors, whether it is baggage or customer service at the airport or reservations. And the contractors provide whatever level of service that they want which is sometimes no service at all. If you are on a delayed flight, which happens, you will pay.

### "this is low cost done very well"
I fly to New York once a year usually from my regional airport connecting via Heathrow to New York, I was thinking of ways to cut costs and make my annual transatlantic flight a lot cheaper for me. I had done some research with the help of google and sky scanner and everything kept pointing to Norwegian. I never had heard of them before and I was wary of travelling with them, so I extended my research on the airline. I looked on their website and it looked very promising. New dreamliners, great routes, excellent prices. It seemed too good to be true but anyway, after some thought I purchased my ticket and waited till the day. I drove down to Gatwick and walked into South Terminal where I checked in at the Kiosk, very fast and simple, the kiosk printed out my bag tag, I labelled my luggage and went to the bag drop where there was no queue at all, I simply passed over my bag to the Aviator staff and they sent it down the belt. So now I'm checked in, I have dropped off my luggage and my flight is on time. No problem so far, time to proceed through security. Getting slightly anxious about trying out this airline for the first time I proceeded to my gate. Once again no queue at the gate, very simple I got my pass scanned and I sat in the gate and waited for my flight to be called for boarding. The only bad experience I had was the International Passenger Survey guys hounding me asking questions about my reasons for travel in the gate. Before I knew it, Norwegian Flight DY7015 was ready for boarding, they invited forward the premium passengers first then economy class straight after. I boarded the flight and found my seat. The aircraft was brand new, clean and comfortable. There was relaxing music playing as boarding commenced and the cabin crew looked very smart and so polite. I sat down and waited for doors closed. They then played us a video about the benefits and advantages of flying on the Dreamliner followed by Norwegian's inflight safety demo. The flight to JFK was smooth. I'd like to point out that the IFE was among the best IFE system I've used. Movies, games, music, information about Norwegian and the map was greatly detailed. They also have a built in snack bar so you can scroll through drinks and snacks and then just swipe your card under the screen and within minutes the crew are by your side with your snacks. The snack bar isn't the cheapest and some items are rather overpriced but its not a big problem. This is low cost done very well. I had the most pleasant experience flying with Norwegian and I now prefer this airline over British Airways who I usually fly with. I can't fault any single aspect of my whole journey and I really enjoyed the whole experience from start to finish. To conclude this review, I would recommend Norwegian to anyone. I have another flight with them booked for next month back to New York.

### "still nickel and dimed us"
Berlin to Los Angeles via Gatwick. The people at the checkin desk forced us to check a small carry on bag. This despite the airline stating that it allows one carry on bag and one personal items like a briefcase or handbag. We had purposefully packed everything we couldn't lose in the bag we were planning to carry on the plane. The over-officious staff tried to say it was a security reason. When we went through security, the officer was as equally puzzled by what the airline staff had said. And sure enough, most people on our flight had one carry on bag (same size or bigger than ours) and a briefcase, backpack, handbag that fits under the seat in front of you. I guess they were able to check in online and bypass the nasty ground staff. For some reason, Norwegian wouldn't let us check in online, maybe because we have a connection to a US flight. The thing that was also troubling is that Norwegian uses the same ground services company for luggage, as the one that lost our suitcase several days prior. I have never had such a problem on other European airlines, nor on US airlines. Lastly, we are connecting onto a flight to The US and booked the Premium cabin (Norwegian's discount business). However they still nickel and dimed us on the connecting flight, charging for water. Lastly, why do they have their checkin at Terminal D, but then make you walk to the opposite side of terminal A for their gates at SXF, and then make you take a bus to the plane? When changing planes at LGW, they tell you you have to be at the gate 1:20 before the flight time. This is also ridiculous. It doesn't take that long to board an airplane.

### "was over 9 hours delayed"
This was the worst flight experience I have ever had. On arriving at the airport, the flight itself was delayed 2 hours, then 4 hours, then 6 hours, and ultimately was over 9 hours delayed by the time it left the gate. The flight was originally scheduled to leave at 2230 (Jan 8th) with everyone for the flight was already at the airport by the time the delays began meaning that we spent approx. 10 hours in the airport overnight with the flight eventually taking off after 6 am (Jan 9th). It was nice of the airline to offer everyone a $15 meal voucher to be used in the airport for our 9+ hour delay, but what they chose not to share as they were handing these out was that there was not a single restaurant or snack bar open in JFK terminal 1 at that time making these vouchers useless. There was no communication from the ground staff of the airline at all and around 1230 am the single Norwegian agent left the gate desk and did not reappear until boarding was scheduled to begin, effectively escaping any accountability or communication to the 300+ stranded passengers. In fact, around 2am the flight listing itself was removed from both the airport departure screens and the Norwegian flight status tracker on their website, leaving the 300+ passengers searching for any agent to provide information as to whether the flight had been cancelled. From the Norwegian website I could see that our incoming flight from Oslo was scheduled to depart Oslo at 6pm local time (noon in New York) and was itself delayed by 8 hours. It became abundantly clear that Norwegian failed to alert passengers on our flight of this delay and chose to inform us of the delay in 1-2 hour increments once we were all already at the airport in order to avoid any associated financial liability to provide passengers for hotel accommodations, meals, rebooking, etc due to the delay. Given I had family I could stay with in the NYC area, upon learning of the first 2 hour delay I called the airline's customer service line to be moved to the flight the next day instead and avoid any prolonged stay in the airport. I was told by the agent that, although the delay allowed me to rebook on another Norwegian flight free of charge, the airline "was not permitting" passengers from our delayed flight to rebook onto another flight until 2 days later. When I inquired if this was because the flights over the next two days were full or because we weren't allowed to be moved to the next day's flight the agent, confusingly, was unable to confirm one way or the other. Additionally, once we were finally on the flight the plane itself was a disaster and had not been cleaned. In our new 787 plane the seats were filthy, there were napkins stuffed in the ceiling above many of the seats in our area and the ceiling panelling was cracked.

### "alright if all goes well"
Norwegian is alright if all goes well, and if the flight is on time. We occasionally have problems with delays or cancelled flights, and then the travel becomes a nightmare. On the last particular occasion, the flight from Barcelona to Stockholm was over 10 hours late. We received the information via SMS. However, when we try to contact the airline or to ask questions about a refund, it is very difficult. The telephone queues are very, very long, and it is impossible to know if we are getting a refund for our additional expenses.

### "made us wait on board for hours"
Norwegian made us wait on board for hours after anouncing they loaded all of the wrong luggage onto the aircraft, and had to search for the luggage of 288 people. During this time, they did not offer any refreshments, save a small cup of water after some time. Near the end of our flight, they came around offering coffee, but sped down the aisles without offering much a glance or interest into who wanted some. When they did stop with the coffee, we had to provide our own cups. My neighbor was forced to offer his plastic water cup for the hot drink. Once arrived in NY, we sat on the tarmac for an hour, no appeasement came from the staff for the anxious customers on board. After finally getting off, they took another 45–60 minutes to start getting luggage off. Not only did I miss my $30 bus ride to Boston, but I had to take 2.40 am Amtrak train to get me back to Boston in time for a wedding. It cost $100. After formally sending in my request for reimbursement, they twice rejected it on the grounds that the delays were extraordinary circumstances beyond their control.

### "had almost no communication "
I fly two or three times a year from New York to Europe for the past 5 years, and I have never had such a bad experience. My flight from CDG to JFK on 01/01/17 was scheduled at 7.35 pm, got canceled after waiting 4 hours in the aircraft because of improper technical maintenance. We were all disembarked at midnight with buses (the aircraft did not get to a gate), which took another hour. No one to give proper information and not able to contact the company. We were all relocated to a very cheap inn (Ibis budget), in the smoking bedrooms which were a disaster. No dinner was served. The next day, our replacement flight was supposed to take off at 1.30pm, then 2.30, then 5.30, then 6.00, and finally took off around 9.00 pm. We had to board by bus, again, no gate connected. When landed in JFK, another wait of 1 hour before getting off the plane because the logistic was not in place and they could not open the gate. Again we took buses. We had almost no communication and only 1 breakfast and 1 sandwich over the total of 62 hours in transit. This is not acceptable. Will never book Norwegian again.

### "affordable and has wifi onboard"
I've flown Norwegian for a a few years now since it's affordable and has wifi onboard. I was scheduled to fly from Stavanger to Gatwick on the evening 30th December, but due to fog in London the flight got cancelled. BA also cancelled their flight and organised a new flight for 07.00 the next morning. Norwegian told us to find our way to their customer service and we were asked to call a number to reschedule our flight. The earliest I could get was a flight 72 hours later. I booked it but decided to check again the morning after and could see on their website that there were suddenly a few seats left one day prior to my new departure. I called the number again saying that I needed to be on the earlier flight. Unfortunately they told me that everything was booked and I had to tell them that I had their website in front of me and could clearly see that there were seats left. They then checked and could finally book me in one day prior to the departure. Damage control now went from 72 hours to 48 hours but only on my own initiative. I've been fairly satisfied with this airline until now. You get what you pay for usually but this is just beyond logic. WiFi usually works onboard and staff are friendly, and cabin interiors are stylish and always clean.

### "cabin crew were welcoming"
Paris Orly to Oslo. Booked the tickets with Norwegian but I was following the departure time from Paris Orly and found that the flight was not departing on time. I was scared I may miss my train from Oslo Airport but luckily the flight was late by 40 min only on the day I flew. The aircraft was not clean as it departed immediately after its arrival, but the cabin crew were welcoming. As a low cost airline, the food is a paid option. On this route Norwegian provide free WiFi on-board which was a positive point.

### "best flight experiences"
Copenhagen to Malaga. Best experince for a discount flight I have had. I boarded the flight with a burning mouth from a spicy pizza. I ask the staff if it was possible to purchase a drink before flight. She gave me a bottle of water. The staff is happy and very friendly everything was done with a big smile. Very entertaining staff also. One of my best flight experiences. And of course the wifi which I am using right now to write this is just perfect!

### "food and beverage is expensive"
Bangkok to Stockholm. Good and comfortable aircraft. Food and beverage is expensive and nothing is included except water. For hot food it's best to book in advance, not the best food and in my opinion not worth the price.

### "we started having to pay for everything"
We thought by being Norwegian we were in for a great flight flying from Bangkok to Amsterdam, but as result we started having to pay for everything which was not very clear when buying the ticket and to our biggest suprise we were not included a free meal in a 12 hour plane ride. We even had to beg for a glass of water and anything that we did end up paying came to be different. I will never take that airline and highly recommend no one does. Big disappointment.

### "it gets delayed again"
When I first started flying back and forth between London and Oslo, Norwegian were the cheapest airline (£30/£50). Complete value for money, seeing as the next cheapest was £110. I have been flying with them twice a month for the last 8 months now and I would choose to fly with someone else unless you don't mind being late. The staff are friendly and polite, and no-nonsense. I've never had trouble with them. Similarly I've never had trouble checking in. It's always a straight forward process, flying with them. I've had almost 20 flights, not a single one has been on time, or not delayed. It's always 20 minutes - why, I don't know. Then it gets delayed again. I'm not sure if they just struggle with Gatwick, seeing as it's a busy airport and since they offer such budget flights, maybe they are low on the fly list, but for some reason you depart by at least 40 minutes. The longest I've been delayed is 3 hours, they had to book me a flight for the following day. Though they didn't provide accommodation or travel expenses as per their policy. They are relatively cheap (their tickets have increased over the year) and a provide a pleasant flight when you're in the air. Not to mention you get access to free WiFi and they play short cartoons on the tv's. The worst part is that they never claim responsibility, every time we're delayed, the captain will give excuses about the tower not letting them leave their previous destination or their current.

### "cannot rate Norwegian high enough"
I flew Gatwick to Los Angeles and returned from Oakland to Gatwick. I cannot rate Norwegian high enough. Check-In took less than 5 minutes on both flights, I used the self-service at Gatwick and it was extremely easy to use. Boarding was organised and fair, which meant you don't have to queue up for ages, you just sit until your row is called forward. I booked the bundled ticket which included seat reservation and a meal. Being 6'5 the extra legroom seat was very roomy, I didn't feel uncomfortable at all during the flight. There was enough movies/Tv shows on the IFE to keep me occupied. I really like that the cabin crew don't come up and down constantly like on a short-haul low cost flight with a trolley, you can just order snacks and drinks from the IFE screen. Aircraft was clean and seemed brand new. The food was standard like all airplane food, it was nice that you get a second meal during the flight too. Cabin crew were nice and professional, I dropped my phone during boarding at Oakland and the cabin crew were so helpful and managed to get the dispatcher to find it for me. Oakland airport itself is amazing coming from San Francisco, its a short ride on the subway and much less busy than SFO. I got through security in minutes. Bags arrived in less than 10-15 mins at Gatwick. It was such a good experience and I paid next-to nothing for the flights. Will 100% book with them again. Norwegian has mastered the low-cost long haul product.

### "positive experience"
Cophenhagen to Fort Lauderdale with Norwegian. Positive experience. A brand new plane, personal monitors, many video choices, choice of booking with a meal, baggage etc (I recommend choosing a meal). I did not choose and it cost me more to buy to-take-out at the airport, besides with food they serve tea and coffee. Unbeatable price around $400 return. The only negative - seats are kind of tight but similar to other major airlines.

### "absolutely appalling, never again"
I booked this as I liked the idea of paying for what I use flying from Gatwick to Orlando with Norwegian. On the way out I ordered food which was very basic. Tea was served in an ice cream type of container. On the way back I went to order a cup of tea 2.5 hrs from landing but the snack bar app was not available. I ask for tea and waited an hour but nothing came. I went to the attendant who refused to serve me tea 1.5 hours before landing. I even offered to pay. Absolutely appalling, never again. Plane itself very good.

### "crew polite and charming"
I'm very impressed with Norwegian. I flew from Oakland to London Gatwick for $550 round trip, would have been less but I checked one suitcase each way for $90. Plane was clean, comfortable and plenty of leg room for the average height. You can opt to add the in-flight meal, but I suggest eating a good meal at the airport and then purchase a snack onboard. Not overly expensive and if you have a water bottle they will happily fill it for you. In flight entertainment has quite a few movies and shows to pass the time, but take your own headset and a warm throw, as they charge extra for these. Be sure to have a debit/CC card for the extras. The crew, ground and inflight were polite and charming. I will certainly fly home more often now it is affordable.

### "very poor service"
London Gatwick to Larnaca with Norwegian. Very poor service at boarding. About 20 passengers left behind in the lounge due to shortage of crew members. Over 1 hour delay (still waiting). Then they started checking in hand luggage into hold from those left in the lounge. So my hand luggage is on the plane now but I can't board. I have seen some poor service before but Norwegian is the worst yet.

### "I cannot yet recommend"
Fort Lauderdale to Paris CDG. There is so much potential for Norwegian here in the States as an economical choice for overseas travel, but a few big dings against it make me not want to fly again. First, let me say the on-board experience is great. The staff is very attentive and the fleet is all new and clean. I found the economy seats to be comfortable and just enough leg room for a 6'-2" guy. The inflight entertainment is acceptable, and ordering food and drinks from the snack bar is quick and easy. For the price, it does not feel much different than any other major airline. No complaints here. The Norwegian App is easy to use, and I thought it would be a big time-saver for check-in. However - and they do not say this online - all flights to/from the USA require in-person check-in. This was an issue, especially for someone like me who was flying in from another city. After landing in Fort Lauderdale, I had to exit completely out of the airport terminal, walk to another terminal, and then wait in line to check-in to my flight to Paris. Spending 2 hours in line with about 300 other people on my flight, I realized this is Norwegian's biggest hurdle to overcome. It's very clear that the Fort Lauderdale airport (which is currently expanding) is not yet equipped to handle the volume of air traffic going through it. I would recommend realistically planning for around 3-4 hours between flights if you are considering flying in from out of town. Getting through border patrol and out of the airport on the way back was just as chaotic. My return flight was delayed by 1.5 hours, which made me miss my connecting flight home and necessitated a hotel stay in Fort Lauderdale. This apparently is a common occurrence on Norwegian, and the second big ding against it. Between the delayed flight, the time waiting in lines, and the hotel stay, I ended up spending about as much money (and a great deal more time) than if I had booked direct out of my city. Until they work out the kinks at the airport and on the app, I cannot yet recommend Norwegian to out-of-towners. There may be flights out of other airports that are easier to manage, but Fort Lauderdale was decidedly not a good experience.

### "had a great IFE system"
Copenhagen to Bangkok. First time using Norwegian and will use them again for another long haul journey. The aircraft was modern, spacious, and had a great IFE system that I thought for a budget airline was just as good as every other non budget long haul experience. Crew were average and flight was on time!

### "the seat has plenty of legroom"
London Gatwick to Ford Lauderdale. Having flown domestically to FLL I jumped at the opportunity to fly direct to FLL from the UK. At LGW a premium cabin ticket gives you access to the One Lounge giving a haven away from the main waiting area. There are plenty of drinks and snacks - the food items available to order are limited and perhaps a bit heavy but having lounge access included is a definite plus. I arrived at the gate and there were 3 lines processing passengers. There was no dedicated line for premium cabin holders advertised and I was in no particular hurry to board so I did not test is priority was available by pushing my way to the front of line. I did observe one person being ejected from the flight for failure to supply satisfactory onward travel arrangements before boarding - they are very hot on this so if you are travelling ESTA ensure you can explain to Norwegian what your onward travel plans are if you are not a return ticket! On board I was offered some water before departure. The seat has plenty of legroom (6ft 4in) and the width is good. It is a recline seat but unless you are small you will have difficulty getting into a natural sleeping position. It is vastly superior to other airlines Premium Economy offerings. Better than Premium Economy but not lie flat business. Food is a standard economy single tray meal augmented with bread on the side. In the premium cabin the main meal and a snack before landing with soft drinks decanted from large bottles / cartons (and also some wine from what I saw) are included with your ticket whereas cans and items such as nuts or anything else off the on-demand menu would need to be purchased like in the main cabin. Conceptually the premium product is excellent. However, arriving into FLL internationally is a poor experience and Norwegian have to accept some of the responsibility as it is a core element of their product. The flight was due to arrive at 20.00. We arrived early at 19.00. We went directly to a stand but there was no air bridge available. The airport claimed due to a number of flights arriving at the same time they could have us disembark and so we were left waiting for the handling agents to service the aircraft. 20.00, our scheduled arrival, came round and still we were left on the plane, doors locked. It became clear that the 344 seat 787 was going have to wait for buses and stairs. Finally at 20.30 a full hour and a half after landing facilities were provided. On opening the doors the ground handling agent "jokingly" told the cabin crew to inform the flight crew that they should "not fly so fast" seemingly insensitive to the fact that so many long haul passengers had been locked on the aircraft for an hour and a half after an 8.5 hour flight. How can Norwegian find this service from their handling agent acceptable? Immigration/Customs at FLL is chaotic. There is no dedicated line for US passport holders or permanent residents so everyone is lumped together. Unless you have Global Entry be prepared. After landing at 7pm I was finally able to leave the airport terminal at 2330. If you fly Norwegian into FLL you need to prepare yourself for the fact the FLL is not really ready to handle such large international aircraft gracefully if there is just the slightest change in capacity. Unfortunately this torrid experience undermines the great price for the ticket (£1000 return). The American cabin crew were very pleasant and accommodating of drinks requests

### "worst flying experience we have had in the last 20 years"
Rome to London Gatwick with Norwegian. Perhaps the worst flying experience we have had in the last 20 years of flying with different airlines. Flight was delayed at origin for more than an hour. Then, the staff could not have been less helpful by giving us seats at the rear of the flight even though they saw us with an infant aged 1.5 years. The cabin crew were talking and laughing so loudly inside the cabin (at midnight) not even realizing they were frequently waking up the sleeping baby with their nuisance. The flight lands and we were told to collect the stroller from the luggage area (unlike British Airways who hand it over to you right at the aircraft door) making me carry the baby all the way up to luggage area (nearly 2km walking and carrying the baby in my arms). In their terms "sit back, relax, and enjoy our hospitality!". Avoid.

### "an hour late on the return"
Gatwick to Copenhagen return. 2.5 hours late out to Copenhagen and then an hour late on the return leg. No apologies or explanation for the delay. Staff didn't try and make up for the delay or offer apologies. They even tried to make me check in my luggage even though it was going under my seat.

### "inflight service was very good"
My wife and I chose Norwegian as it was the only airline to offer a non stop service from London Gatwick and San Juan, which was a god send for us, and the incredibly low fare. Norwegian are very open on their website as to what each fares offer and what you get with your ticket and what you don't, so we knew what service to expect. We chose the low fare+ ticket as we had cases to check in and wanted the meal option. On to the flight Norwegian operate a very modern fleet of Boeing 787's for long haul flights, I've never flown on one of these before and was impressed with the comfort levels in the cabin along with all the little extra touches (sub charger points, sunglasses mode on Windows, mood lighting etc). The IFE screens are very good also (the best I've come across so far for clarity) and offer plenty of choice. The moving map was also pretty cool. The inflight service on both outbound and return flight was very good, crew was very polite and helpful. The meals were very good and pretty tasty. Both flights took of on time and landed early. It's a shame Norwegian don't offer this service all year round as I would use them for this route all the time. They only operate between November and April to work with the cruises which is understandable but annoying as it would be great to have a non stop option year long rather than have to use another airline with at least 1 layover. The only small negatives I would mention would be the boarding process being a bit chaotic and unorganised. once they had board indeed rows 25-47 the announcements seemed to stop and everyone just bundled on. This happened both ways. Overall though I would 100% fly with them again and have already recommended them to others. I can only see them growing as an airline. I've flown BA and American on transatlantic flights and for me Norwegian were the ones I enjoyed flying with the most.

### "constant lateness is staggering"
I have flown several times recently from Malaga to Manchester with Norwegian and everytime it has been late. Usually about an hour late but even then often you are not notified until inside the airport and stuck inside. I decided to check on flightstats how many times they were late and it's almost daily. On the 25th nov I had a flight back to Manchester with them at 16.05pm and knew they would be late by 45-minutes to 1 hour. I decided not to enter the airport on arrival at 2pm but instead just checked the monitor. To my shock they were delayed until 7pm. On asking the Norwegian office they said there was a lack of crew and they needed a rest. I told him that perhaps this airline won't be around much longer as their lack of customer service and constant lateness is staggering. It makes me want to open my own business because the level of incompetence on this airline is staggering and i've flown a lot of airlines.

### "the prices are relatively low"
I fly with Norwegian twice every month, because I have business in Paris and like Orly airport much more than CDG and it is closer to my home in Paris. Flights are often delayed, information about delay missing, no communication with passengers. I can live with that as the prices are relatively low, even though Finnair doesn't cost much more and has better customer service, but it flies to CDG. Staff onboard is normally very nice and helpful, Internet works well, no complaints. I had extremely unpleasant experience with Norwegian customer service after last trip to Helsinki from Paris. As a frequent flyer I got some benefits from Norwegian like free baggage and seat reservation. I barely use them as I always travel with hand luggage only, but when I was coming back from Paris last time I decided to take big bag as I thought I had it included because of my "reward". As was stated in the email I got, I had free bag to all the flights with unlimited use. When I got email about this reward there was no info of how to use it, nor there was on the webpage showing my account and rewards and benefits I had. I assumed I could just take a bag and register it. It appeared to be impossible and at the airport I was supposed to pay 50 euros. I could not pay in the baggage drop so I was supposed to run and search for the place to pay as the lady on the counter didn't speak english. Eventually, I almost missed my flight. I sent email to Norwegian customer service but after 2 weeks there was no reply. I sent one more email and got a reply that "all information was on our webpage, good bye". I feel mistreated and very upset, as if I knew how this works I would just travel without bag and would not have to experience such a stressful situation.

### "surprisingly great considering the cost"
Flew Norwegian from London to Las Vegas. Surprisingly great considering the cost, one of the best long haul economy flights I've experienced in a while. Was seated in Row 6 which benefits from extra legroom and is a bit quieter given there are 5 rows only here between PE seats and the galley. Seats comfortable, food (which I had free due to booking via Lastminute) was ok, but when is it ever great and service was pleasant enough. IFE was just about OK. It's pretty basic in terms of screen quality and not as much choice as a BA or VA flight but good enough for 10 hours. Overall though very comfortable flight and considering it cost a third of the price of the nearest competitor I would highly recommend if price is important.

### "fantastic service"
London Gatwick to Tenerife with Norwegian. Never flown with them before. Never even heard of them. Excellent airline. Friendly staff, more leg room than normal for basic flight. Flights on way out and in, both left on time. On way home landed 45 minutes early. TV on plane, Wifi available. Music playing before you take off, very relaxing. Fantastic service. Fantastic Flight.

### "PE seats very comfortable"
Las Vegas to London Gatwick with Norwegian. Excellent airline - Premium Economy seats very comfortable as I am 6 foot / 250lbs. Aircraft very quiet, many features, such as dimming windows, seats recline, yet, does not interfere with passengers sitting behind, seats also include foot rest, yet, if you are tall they really don't provide much comfort, although my Wife used hers and was very comfortable. Food and service excellent, Beef/Shrimp on way out, Chicken on way back, plus little extras being served, beverages are free flowing, yet, you sometimes need to ask. They now have a snack store that you can order via video screen and use you credit card and service was good. Movies were limited, probably due to initial start up, choose seats 5G/J for added comfort. Only negatives were, some people were given Premium Economy seats who only paid for Economy Seat, as, many seats were available - if you paid Premium Economy prices and see this then you can be a bit upset. Arriving in Las Vegas and Gatwick, baggage off loading, was terrible we waited for ages, it doesn't do any good to be let off before Economy passengers and then wait with everyone else, must improve. Overall excellent flight, cabin quieter than anything flying, attendants very helpful, yet, male flight attendants jackets were the worst I have ever seen.

### "new and very clean aircraft"
I travelled with Norwegian for a round trip between Oslo and Longyearbyen Svalbard, and from CPH to LGW. New and very clean aircrafts with possibly the best seats you can expect from a low cost carriers. Service and punctuality were OK. The onboard wifi was free but don't expect a really fast speed. Their price was a little bit higher than other low cost airlines with OSL/LYR return costs £175, but considering the route and quality this was acceptable. Will take again and may try the long-haul to the US.

### "cabin crew were amazing"
Fuerteventura to London Gatwick with Norwegian. The cabin crew were amazing on this flight, the boarding was delayed for about 30 minutes and my daughter was desperate for the toilet by the time we boarded and as soon as we stepped on the plane I said to the air hostess and she let my daughter go into the toilet while she held the door and was really friendly. Later my children were restless as it was a late flight and the seat belt sign came on - my youngest did not want her seat belt on so the same air hostess came and sat and spoke to her then even came back with two lollipops to cheer her up. When they came with their trolley to buy food and drinks they had ran out of the sandwiches we asked so the cabin crew gave us a free sandwich because they didn't have what we wanted. The air hostess who had been to us a few times came to us just before landing to see our youngest because again she didn't want to put her seatbelt on and she said she had spoke to the pilot and she was promising when we had landed they could go in and see him. When we landed they took my oldest into the cockpit and she got to sit in the pilots seat and they put all the lights on for her - my daughter loved this. I have never flown with Norwegian before but I will definitely be recommending this company. The plane itself was very clean and had plenty of leg room. They even had free wifi and had tv on with cartoons that the kids could watch.

### "flying Norwegian is ok"
First time with Norwegian. Very full flight from Copenhagen to Las Vegas. We booked economy+, meaning reserved seats, Hot meal and a sandwich for breakfast. Meals are quite small, so eat before flights. Cabin crew in our section was a rude woman. Films on board are ok, no inflight music on Norwegian. Return flight Las Vegas to Oslo almost all cabin crew from Thailand. Very polite and friendly, they perfomed well, and this made the entire flight very pleasant. Flying Norwegian is ok.

### "very friendly, very professional"
Gatwick to Los Angeles and great service, clean fresh cabin, seat very comfortable. Flight left few minutes late however we arrived on time. Cabin crew very friendly, very professional and attentive. Food ok just like any plane food. Great move choice and the moving map is really good feature. Boarding and landing music really good. Definitely recommended if you want cheap transatlantic flight.

### "no lumbar support in seats "
Flew Norwegian from London Gatwick to Boston. My first time on a no frills airline. The air was slightly better on a 787, but the crowded plane in economy with no meal (I didn't pre-order the relatively high priced meal service) made the flight seem almost endless. The ticket price was good, but I think if I need to save that much money I would prefer to just stay home. There is no lumbar support in the seats and the planes were  full. I never got comfortable in the 7 plus hours.

### "best flying experience"
Gatwick to Las Vegas with Norwegian and the best flying experience ever. Flight was called about 2 hours early, found out when I got to the gate, there was a party going on to celebrate their inaugural flight to Las Vegas complete with a Las Vegas showgirl champagne and cake! The flight was excellent and on arrival there was yet more champagne! All in all a memorable day and such good value for money. I am now looking forward to my return flight.

### "this flight was a dream"
Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale. This flight was a dream, took off only ten minutes late but made up time despite changing route to avoid storms. The inflight entertainment was good, but you need to take your own headsets unless you want to pay. The staff were pleasant enough but service was a bit slow at times. Probably not their fault just the system used. When booking you have the choice of booking a meal. The food was inedible, most of the passengers on the flight who had flown with Norwegian before had packed their own sandwiches which tells you everything. I would not hesitate to book with them again, but wouldn't ever pre book the food. Probably the worst airline food I have ever been served.

### "very bad communication"
Oslo to Amsterdam with Norwegian. A delay of more than 3 hours and very bad communication. A food voucher of 110 Krone but all the stores are closed except one, therefore you have enough for a child's pizza. After 3 hours they finally announce a technical problem but no indication of when it will end. This is the worst customer service I ever seen.

### "super friendly staff"
New York JFK to Oslo. I was wary to fly Norwegian because of all the negative reviews I'd seen but for the price I figured I'd just deal with it. It was not a negative experience at all. I'd even go so far as to say I enjoyed flying with them. I did 4 legs with them JFK to Oslo, Oslo to Pisa, Venice to Oslo and Copenhagen to JFK. The intra-European flights all had free wifi, which was awesome. My bag was under 23 kilos so I didn't have to deal with check-in, and there was always enough space for it. IFE was good. They pressurize the cabin beautifully and it's very comfortable. Super friendly staff, both on the plane and at the airport. Modern, sleek facilities. I love that they board the plane from the front and back in order to expedite things - why don't all airlines do that? I fly a lot, probably 2 or 3 trips a month. Ive had bad airport / airline experiences before. This was wholly pleasant. The only reason I don't give it 10/10 is because you can (potentially) get nickeled and dimed for every thing (food, seat selection, baggage) and because they don't serve water throughout the flight - you have to buy it. That ain't cool, especially on long flights.

### "strongly hesitate in travelling with them again"
Oslo to Dublin with Norwegian. I would have to countenance this airline's "low-fares" branding. Firstly, I added "fast-track" to my ticket for an extra €12 though as the aircraft was called for boarding at gate F21 it was a free-for-all with no special announcement to board families or passengers who had paid for fast-track first. Waste of money. Secondly, the gate agent had an issue with my bag as I was boarding and made me stand aside for almost 10 minutes until she boarded everyone else. My bag was under the 10kg restriction but she referred to a 55cm dimension limit. I explained I'd no issue with the bag on the way over with a different airline and she said different airlines have different baggage rules. I quipped that I'd be travelling with the other airline in future. She was quite rude, unfriendly and uncompromising. I don't see what the dimension issue is. The bag weighed 9kg - Surely weight means more than dimension size. I was charged a hefty 400kr/€45 (only cards accepted) and this has unfortunately left a sour taste after an awesome trip to Norway. Baggage took some time to deliver in Dublin. The only positives were that the flight departed on time and arrived early, free, slow onboard wifi and air stewards were professional maybe somewhat robotic. However, all this airline wants is your money, charges hefty add-ons without providing them and really nothing else matters. I'm sorry now I didn't choose to travel SAS on this route for €130 as I had on DUB-OSL-BER. By the time I'd finished with Norwegian yesterday the fare totalled €160. I would strongly hesitate in ever travelling with them again.

### "best low cost airline in Europe"
Oslo to Malaga. Norwegian has modern planes, good service and cheap fares. The best low cost airline in Europe in my opinion. Much better than Ryanair albeit at just a slightly higher premium. Recommended!

### "Very helpful staff"
London Gatwick to Los Angeles. Very helpful staff on both directions. I have never flown with them and I enjoyed the process from booking my ticket to leaving the plane. Not once did I get the feeling that cabin staff was tired or fed up regardless of my request or at what time during the flight I requested it. Boeing 787is less fatiguing plane and I like that we landed back into Gatwick very quickly..

### "toward the top end of the spectrum"
Recently took Norwegian for a trip to Europe. We went New York to Paris roundtrip. As far as budget airlines go, I would put this toward the top end of the spectrum. The planes are new and nice, IFE systems are top-notch, and service is pretty good as well. That said, keep in mind that even though things look sleek and well put together, you are still flying a budget airline and everything cost something. Of course, that is a given, but I was a little surprised when they didn't even offer water on a 7hr transatlantic flight. Also, they really push their duty free sales prior to landing - even going as far as turning on the cabin lights an hour and a half before landing, so you can see what they are selling. All that said, I do think the cheap ticket prices and new planes make it worth the flight - just know what you are getting into. Here are some helpful tips that I learned from my flight: Norwegian is very strict about the weight of carry-on bags, going as far as weighing every bag you are carrying (including purses and backpacks). Make sure your bags are no more then 10KG or they will make you check it. Buy food for the flight before getting to the airport and bring it onto the plane. That said, don't bring anything that will require hot water or rehydration (eg - Ramen/Cup of Noodles), as they will not give you the hot water, you'll have to buy it. If you do want to buy food onboard, do not reserve a meal before the flight, it's $45. Instead, buy the meal or snacks from the IFE system, it will only cost $14. Note that they might run out though. Boarding in NYC was quick and efficient, however boarding in Paris was a mess with staff losing control of the process creating a free-for-all to get on the plane. If you are picking a seat, do not pick the bulkheads. We sat in row 7 on the JFK-CDG flight, and even though we had extra leg room, the seats were extremely narrow and a bit hard. On the CDG-JFK flight we sat in row 13, which seemed to be a few inches wider, softer, and leg room was sufficient.

### "delayed and no explanation"
Gatwick to Ibiza return on a package holiday through Thomson. Flight out delayed by over an hour, as they had lost a member of the crew. No other information. Annoying, but the flight was fine otherwise. Return trip, flight delayed and no explanation. Our flight was over an hour delayed. It is no fun being on a flight full of overtired children. Delay caused us to miss last train from London, made it home after 2am as a result.

### "everything was perfect"
I flew from Berlin (SXF) to Oslo (OSL) and everything was perfect: punctuality of departure, service on board, friendly staff, free wifi on board. I didn’t pay for anything extra (like the meal, reserved seat, etc), just for 1 piece of luggage dropped at the counter. They don’t provide inflight entertainment, but I can tolerate this keeping in mind the cheap ticket that I paid.

### "value is excellent overall"
I flew Norwegian from New York to Bangkok, with a stopover in Oslo. I was very surprised when I boarded the plane - it was the cleanest, most modern plane I'd even flown on. The seats were also roomier than any other long haul airline I have flown (Aer Lingus, British Airways, Delta, KLM, and United). Although the entertainment did not have as many options as other airlines, the value is excellent overall. At a fraction of the price, I would happily fly Norwegian again. My only recommendation is to make sure your ticket includes an inflight meal. Some tickets don't include meals, which was a surprise some passengers. If your ticket doesn't include a meal, I suggest grabbing some snacks at the airport.

### "you cannot beat the offering"
This is my first time flying Norwegian and I was very impressed with their Premium Economy cabin. Flew from Oslo to Oakland. With 46 inches of pitch, the product is between traditional fly flat business class (DL, AF, LH) and traditional Premium Economy (AF, LH, BA) which usually has about 38 inches of pitch. The result? You had much more room than the current premium economy offering by BA, LH and AF, but you pay much less. The leather covered seat reclines to about a 45 degree angle and has a legrest so you can really sleep in way you cannot duplicate with the typical Prem Eco seat. I normally pay about 2200-2400 Euros return for TXL-SFO-TXL on AF or LH. For Norwegian, I paid 1275 Euros return and that was just 5 days prior to departure. That is incredible value. The 787-8 was spotless and brand new. Flight attendants were courteous, friendly and ever present (an all Asian flight crew). The food was fine. The meal came in a box and with plastic silverware and glasses, but the food tasted good and fresh. Beer, wine and liquor were complementary. The entertainment wasn't as extensive as LH or AF, but I did find three movies/tv series that I wanted to watch. The screen was decent sized. The blanket was nice. There were not any pillows or amenity kits but I didn't miss them. I brought one of the many extra amenity kits I have from AF and just used that. The Oslo premium lounge was very good and had a wide selection of food, beverages and spirits. It was calm, quiet, cozy and not over filled with too many passengers. The lounge experience was just as good as any other full service experience at any major European carrier - maybe even a little better. It is understandable why Norwegian has won World's Best Long-haul Low Cost Carrier. It simply provides outstanding aircraft equipment, seat pitch, seat comfort, food, onboard service and ground services for much less than its competitors. Sure the tableware is not as fine, there are no pillows or amenity kits, but for this price you cannot beat the offering.

### "service was excellent"
Gatwick to Boston with Norwegian. Check in smooth, quick and friendly (despite Gatwick ground staff member constantly interrupting proceedings). Boarding was effective and efficient. Flight was good, service was excellent, food and drinks were plentiful too. No problems and will definitely use again. They just need to widen their destinations.

### "use Norwegian again to fly"
Orlando to Gatwick. I booked a last minute trip and so Norwegian were my only viable option. I was not looking forward to the flight but was very pleasantly surprised by everything. I took my own water and entertainment on board just in case but both were available free of charge which was great. You do have to pay for blankets and ear phones though so take your own if you do not want to be charged. I also took my own small pillow with me which helped with the hard seat. The plane was a new Boeing 787 and I had enough leg room to stretch my legs under the seat in front which meant that I actually slept for a few hours. The seat was quite hard but I am never comfortable on an overnight flight. My pre purchased vegetarian meal was delivered to me with no problems. The staff seemed friendly enough when delivering all of the items. You can order items from the snack bar using your credit card. I did this and they were delivered to me within ten minutes. Great idea. I was also able to see which seats were available before I booked my flight which to me was a bonus vs BA/Virgin. The one negative I have is that check in at Orlando was very slow. There were not enough staff working the desks vs the amount of people attempting to check in. We departed and arrived on time. If the price difference vs BA or Virgin is £150+ then I will totally use Norwegian again to fly to the USA.

### "very happy long haul low cost experience"
Exactly what I expected and that's a good thing. Booked a return 'lowfare' trip from London Gatwick to Oakland with Norwegian. Added seat reservations and luggage separately, did not add meals. Recommend doing this and taking your own food. This saved about £50 in total from upgrading for the 'lowfare+' but still gave me the bags/seat I wanted. The aircraft is brand new, so cabin cleanliness and quality is obviously quite good (this will probably change over time). Seats recline and there is legroom enough for the 5ft 7 man for 10hrs. Boarding was very quick at each end. Staff generally friendly and cheerful. Very good quality updates from flight crew. Inflight entertainment is easy to use. You can order and pay for nibbles from the 'snack bar' using the IFE (It has a card swiper - no cash accepted). Gatwick was Gatwick, Oakland's departure lounge has a nice view and no less than 3 Starbucks. Online/mobile check in for flights to the USA with Norwegian isn't available at the time of writing (something I like). Once you've checked in at the airport, you can refresh your Norwegian app and get a boarding pass for Apple Wallet if you want it (also something I like). There was also no wifi on this trip. The feature that allows you to order from the snack bar on the IFE is great. Personally, I like it. However, during meal services the snack bar is 'closed'. It is very difficult to get the cabin crew's attention during that time if you have not pre-ordered a meal. If you need water, or anything else, you'll have to verbally interrupt them serving food and ask. (They ignored the call bell in both directions during those times). Overall, a very happy first-time long haul low cost experience. Good aircraft, good enough service for the price you pay, and an easier night's sleep thanks to the 'sunglasses mode' windows. Give it a go.

### "staff were rude and unhelpful"
I flew with Norwegian from Gatwick to Alicante on the 06/09/2016 through Thomson and the flight was comfortable and the staff helpful and nice. The aircraft was clean. The flight home was uncomfortable, the staff were rude and unhelpful, they didn't do the safety routine but put a video on then turned it off then restarted it again. Once up in the air passengers started to go toilet at the back of the plane were I was sat (which was fine) but the toilet on the right side was disgusting it had to be locked off. The staff response of - oh how did it get like that, the toilet opposite was filthy with no toilet paper. Never again will I use this airline.

### "the flight was cancelled"
My wife and I were booked on Norwegian to fly home from Palma de Mallorca to London Gatwick on Saturday 24 September 2016. We had checked in online the night before and had our boarding cards. When we arrived at the airport for our flight home to London Gatwick, we queued for over an hour to be told that the flight was cancelled. Norewgian had not contacted us in any way beforehand (phone / email etc. ), and there was no Norwegian representative or office at the airport. Iberia staff told us that Norwegian had informed them to 'tell passengers to make their own arrangements to fly home'. All Iberia staff told us that they had never experienced such a bad situation before and that Norwegian had behaved disgracefully. We tried every airline office in the terminal but no flights to London were available that evening except a very busy Monarch flight to London Luton airport. We bought the last 2 tickets on this flight but had to ask our son to drive 264 miles to collect us at Luton at 03.00 the next day, drive us to Gatwick to recover our car, and then return home exhausted and very angry. I believe the flight was cancelled to save costs (another Norwegian flight to Gatwick left the same evening), but the company gave no thought to the awful consequences for the passengers they abandoned.

### "now in to a 24hr delay"
Disgusted with the way we have been treated by Norwegian. Our flight was cancelled and there was no explanation as to why. We were in the airport for 4 hrs before being told of the cancellation and then we were herded like cattle to a bus which took us to a hotel an hour away from the airport. At 11.30 that night we were told that they couldn't accommodate us with flights home and we would have to do everything ourselves in the morning. We then had to pay to get back to Malaga airport where we were told that unfortunately Norwegian couldn't help us and we had to buy another flight from another airline. Of course my husband and I couldn't afford to buy a new flight, so after a few cross words we were offered a hotel for another night only and they would try and get us a flight. We were given a number to call for assistance and guess what, all was spoken in Norwegian. We are now in to a 24hr delay and still don't know how or when we are going home.

### "was fantastic to fly with"
Cologne-Bonn to Alicante. Norwegian was fantastic to fly with. Normally we fly Ryanair, which is ok but not the best. This was the first time that Norwegian was cheaper than Ryanair so we chose Norwegian. WiFi was not working. The leg room was better, the airplane was beautiful and everyone was friendly. Check-in at the airport (Alicante) by person and not by machine.

### "the service was great"
Oslo to Los Angeles. I loved the Boeing 787, best I've ever flown on! The premium seats were reasonably spacious and comfortable, the service was great, the entertainment system was awesome! I had chosen as options an assigned seat and their "nice and tasty menu", which was average as airline food goes. Enjoyed the hot meal of curried chicken, though the accompanying pasta salad seemed a little odd. That was served shortly after takeoff. The cold meal, served shortly before landing, was quite OK. There were no shades on the windows, but they automatically darkened gradually as we flew. Loved the option to order snacks whenever wanted through the entertainment system! Flight attendants would then deliver them almost instantly. The flight arrived on time after 10 hours and 40 minutes nonstop from Oslo to LAX. I will definitely try to fly Norwegian next time I go to Europe - though will avoid leaving from Oslo Gardemoen even if I have to take a train to somewhere else.

### "FA's were courteous"
Copenhagen to Oslo. Self service check in was smooth. Staff on ground was helpful in assisting with their self service baggage dropping. Boarding was smooth as flight was not full. FA's were courteous. Wifi is available but were slow, still you can watch some programmed videos on their app which you can download on your own device.

### "are helpful and very courteous"
Oslo to Rome. Self service check in and baggage drop were smooth and convenient. Gate staff are nice. Cabin crew are helpful and very courteous. No wifi on the aircraft so even the Norwegian app cannot be use on my personal ipad. Flight was smooth and on time. Landed nicely. Baggage were a bit delayed on arrival although its given as plane was parked far from terminal.

### "their crew for being attentive"
I was travelling with my family (including my 81 years old grandmother) from Reykjavik (Iceland) to Bergen (Norway) on 26th August 2016. We would like to send our greatest thanks to Norwegian Air because of their crew for being attentive and did their extra mile during our flight. My grandma was feeling not well during the flight, and the stewardess gave their best to help my grandma by giving her oxygen, move her to the front seat, ask her whether she wants an emergency landing and even prepare ambulance once we arrive in Bergen. The Pilot did his best, we are supposed to arrive within 2hours 40mins, and we  landed within 2 hours. The flight the crew is friendly and helpful, we also got free sandwich and beverages. Thank you Norwegian ! I will definitely recommend and use your airline again in the future!

### "a good low cost product"
Travelled Norwegian in early September from Amsterdam to Oslo in the afternoon service. The take off was delayed by 45 mins due to delay in arrival of aircraft. I was lucky to have allocated the first row window seat at the counter, after request. The first row has very good leg space. The take off was smooth and the captain made up significant time in the air and the flight landed only 30 mins late. Overall, a good low cost product, considering the ticket was only $50 and efficient crew.

### "4 flights, 3 were delayed"
London Gatwick to Budapest via Copenhagen with Norwegian. My first flight to CPH was delayed. I asked at the check-in gate at LGW to assure me that my short connection would be ensured. Check-in staff could not promise, but if I missed the connection, I would be put on the next flight and if that flight was not until the next day, Norwegian would put me in a hotel. I got no help for my connection, had to run 1km to the gate. My connecting plane was still at the gate, but the boarding staff of Norwegian refused to allow us to board, saying the flight was closed. She told us to go to rebook. The counter staff was surprised to see me, and asked me why I had not gone straight to the gate for my flight, as the flight should have known I was coming and should have waited for me. I explained what had happened and the staff was embarrassed. She told me the quickest way was to rebook me via Stockholm, where Norwegian would “put me in a hotel” and I would fly to my destination the next day. I agreed. My flight to Stockholm was delayed until 01.00. I arrived at ARN at 02.10 and went straight to assistance counter to ask for accommodation. I found absolutely nobody to help me. Security told me “all the hotels in Stockholm are full” and suggested I “get a car, go to Uppsala, try to find a hotel then send the bill to Norwegian”. I had to get back to the airport by 08.00 so that was not realistic. I arrived at my destination the next day at 12.20, more than 15 hours late, after a sleepless night and having been treated disrespectfully Norwegian staff, or there was nobody there. I am disgusted. Of 4 flights, 3 were delayed. I complained to Norwegian but they didn’t reply.

### "great service"
My wife, daughter and I travelled from Rome to London Gatwick on 17th August on the late evening flight - I was impressed with the facilities provided by Norwegian for my injured wife. My wife had an accident while exploring our holiday in Rome. She twisted her ankle. It was extremely difficult for her to walk from the airport counter to the aeroplane, she was specially taken on a wheelchair and from the boarding gate all of us were transferred to the aeroplane by a special ambulance via the emergency entrance. The staff at the counter and in the aeroplane were kind and supportive. They asked Gatwick airport to provide the same facilities which were also provided later when we landed at London Gatwick. Great Service. My very special thanks to Norwegian.

### "recommend Norwegian any day"
London Gatwick to Tenerife South. Really good service, crew were nice, smooth flight and there was WiFi on board which is good, recommend Norwegian any day. The best lowcost airline, keep it up. A good map of the flight, quick and no delay. Can spend points, comfy seats and more.

### "some internet troubles"
Copenhagen to Dublin. Had many flight with Norwegian company before, never had such a trouble. Couldn't get my check in online, tried over 20 times during 24h, because sometimes might be some internet troubles or some other things. So came up to Copenhagen airport to do check-in at check-in machine, tried over 5 machines, couldn't do that because I had ID-card, so was looking for the Norwegian desk to sort that out. They don't have that. You need to go to baggage desk. Wait in the waiting line, and heard then two guys couldn't get check-in because gates are closed, checked the time, my gates closing shortly, asked everybody to allow me to sort that out and got the same answer, sorry you not gonna fly today. It cost me 180€ to get other ticket with other company next day and done check in in less then a minute.

### "the best value in flying today"
Los Angeles to Copenhagen. There are a lot of horror stories about Norwegian. I almost had one of my own, but speaking for myself and this time, I must say I was a happy camper. First, Norwegian has the first scheduled non-stop between LAX and Copenhagen in over 20 years. For someone who flies often to Scandinavia from Southern California, this is a godsend. Second, the "almost" was the fact that we pushed out for the gate on the dot, then sat on the taxiway until the captain announced we had an "electrical issue" and would have to return to the gate. An hour and a half later we were in the air, arriving CPH 45 minutes late. I checked Business for class flown. Some might object, calling Norwegian Premium, "Premium Economy," but I think "Business" is closer to the experience. Separate check-in, fast-track security, Business lounge, priority boarding, separate front cabin and toilets. Only missing are lie-flat seats, china/linen meals and endless alcohol. (You do get wine/beer with the meal and choice of three entries.) The seats are roomy and recline way back. The One World Business lounge at LAX, which admits Norwegian Premium passengers, is world class. Norwegian has a problematic on-time statistic, but most flights are on time or close to it. And, most important, for those who get it, Norwegian Premium is by far the best value in flying today.

### "they don't do customer service"
Flew from Budapest to London Gatwick. We consciously took hand luggage to minimise time at the airport so that we could get our connecting train on the return journey (as a result of waiting for our luggage we missed our train which had a knock on effect to the rest of our 6 hour journey). On boarding the plane (late and chaotic process) we were told by cabin staff that our bags would have to go in the hold because other people who boarded before us had too many bags. What's the point of having rules about hand luggage if no one has to follow them? The cabin staff blamed the airport check in staff and shrugged as much to say 'I don't care'. Some members of staff were brusque to the point of being rude and when ordering food (most of which they didn't have!) the air hostess was dealing with several customers at the same time and having several different conversations - very rude. If I see Norwegian on any future holidays I will just look for something else - they don't do customer service.

### "both of the flights were delayed"
Both of the flights were delayed. Furthermore, on the first flight, not only was it delayed, but we also had to wait for another hour and a half due to an electrical problem. Nothing was provided to the passengers during the wait, no meals, beverages or snacks. The second tier of the trip, from Copenhagen to Madrid was also delayed for an hour and a half.

### "Professional staff and good service"
Trondheim to Gatwick. Very impressed by both outbound and return flight. Very clean aircraft and comfortable seats with plenty of foot room (I am 6'1"). Professional staff and good service from pay as you go trolley. Free inflight wifi and this worked well for email and provided programming. Certainly the best Intra-European flight that I have had in a while and much better than economy product of US airlines. Easy check-in and quick bag return on both segments.

### "bags had not been loaded"
Gatwick to Barcelona. Flight was delayed by an hour which wasn't a major issue. Onboard I found the service from the Spanish cabin crew unfriendly and unwelcoming. On arrival at Barcelona we parked at a gate with a jetbridge but despite this they insisted on bringing stairs and a bus to carry us 10m to the airport door. Got to the baggage carousel and eventually 10 bags came out before the belt stopped with more than 50 people still waiting for a bag. A rep from Norwegian came to the belt and started talking on his radio - he told us that they were checking the plane to see if they had missed any bags. Eventually the message came through that there were no more bags and that more than 50 passengers bags had not been loaded. Without any form of apology he passed out a form and told us to fill it in and give it back and they would call us if the bags were found. He refused to supply tracking numbers and denied that the airline had any duty to supply vouchers for essentials. Eventually 48h later my bag turned up. On way back my bag was not loaded and got delivered (care of British Airways) 24h later.

### "the best low cost airline"
Flew from Warsaw to London-Gatwick. I always consider choosing Norwegian as I invariably have good experiences flying with them. The crew on most flights are kind and smiling. What is more, they are helpful and do their best to make your flight comfortable. I find the aircrafts new, tidy and clean and I really like the new Boeing's sky interior which you can find on most Norwegian's planes. This means there are slightly bigger windows, more space for cabin luggage and mood lighting. The other feature I think of when choosing airline is the comfort of seats. With Norwegian the pitch of the seat is comfortable and the seats reclines as well. Furthermore, if you arrive at the airport early, you can ask for an extra legroom seat (1st row or exit rows). I think it's also a good idea that they show the safety demo on the monitors onboard (it's clear and you can hear and see everything). Overall, Norwegian is the best low cost airline I have flown with.

### "cheap and easy to fly with"
Gatwick to Budapest. I love Norwegian because they are so cheap and easy to fly with. The flight was on time and arrived a bit early. Flights start from GBP 30, and you get the best service to cost than any other airline on this route. The new Boeing 737-800s are brilliant, comfortable and very fuel efficient.
