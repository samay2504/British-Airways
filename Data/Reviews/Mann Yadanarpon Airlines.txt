### "very friendly cabin"
Nyaung U to Mandalay. Booked this flight a few months in advance and due to a change in their schedule, I was changed to another flight of them without any notice as I checked about two weeks in advance, however this flight was never going to reach Mandalay. Made contact with them in order to change me on a different flight and they just send me a mail to reconfirm my change. Mailed again and was finally placed on the correct flight. This took about three days to adjust. Early flight from Bagan to Mandalay which is just 78 miles far. Chaotic boarding by old bus, but welcomed to a very friendly cabin while the cabin was about 1/4 full from a previous flight with passengers that were going to continue with us to Mandalay. Choose a free seat (no seats assigned to you). After the safety briefing, we quickly departed to Mandalay which was barely 25 minutes long. Barely any service provided by any cabin (too short of a flight), but were served some candy. Landed ahead of time and bus to terminal, which took about 10 minutes for our luggage to arrive.

### "service was excellent"
Flew the short 45 minute flight from Yangon to Thandwe (Ngapali Beach) in January 2017. One class cabin with economy seats in a 2-2 setup. Despite the short flight, service was excellent with a breakfast snack (mainly pastries) and tea/coffee served, as well as lollies on descent. Having flown Air China the day before on two flights of 1.5 - 2 hours, Mann Yadanarpon Airlines were in a different league. Smooth flight, good views, though given the still developing infrastructure in the country flights were expensive.
