### “Worst customer service ever”
Allegiant cancelled when we were already at the airport. Worst customer service ever and anyone we talked to over the phone was rude. They cancelled our first flight on a round trip and then didn’t tell us the other one was cancelled until the day before. DO NOT FLY ALLEGIANT.

### "Worst customer service"
Worst customer service I ever experienced in my life. Flight was supposed to leave at 2:30 today they said it got canceled because of a plane issue. And then now they are saying it’s because of the weather. There weather is great over here. Not snowing, raining, or windy. I’m very upset because they do not want to accommodate anyone. There’s me and 20 other people including children stranded at this airport without any food, water, or lodging. If they really cared about their passengers they would give them some type of voucher to get us by until we can get to our destination. I wouldn’t recommend this airline to anyone.

### "so much entertainment and energy"
I’m not used to so much entertainment and energy from the flight crew. Elissa and her crew (Holly) were phenomenal. They used a sense of humor to convey the dos and don’ts of flying. They made sure they had every passengers attention before giving us the safety run down. They kept unruly passengers from ruining the flights of others and kept us up to date regarding weather conditions and flying conditions. Other flight attendants are so stiff they seem robotic. Not true with Elisa and Holly. They were charismatic but stern when regarding safety issues. I would fly much more often if I could have this crew every time.

### “One unhappy customer”
I would NEVER fly this airline again. Left yesterday and arrived to the airport 1 hour before my flight left, was told that they will not take my checked bag and the flight was already boarded up and ready to go. Spoke with the so called manager named “Mackenzie” that worked at flint airport, she continues to discriminate me and said I was late for the flight asking me why I was late when I was actually on time. 4 workers standing there and no one could assist the situation. Such an absolute joke. Needless to say I was told by them to go buy two duffle bags and use those as carry-on, yup let me just take all my personal belongings out of my suitcase and shove them in a duffle bag. Had to make my family member drive all the way back to the airport to pick up our suitcase. As we were running to the gate because we were told the flight is all boarded up we get through tsa and arrived at our gate and the plane is delayed and not even there yet. One unhappy customer. Plane was also a joke the manager came on board of the plane and warned the flight attendants about us? So unprofessional! Absolutely will never waste me time and money on the airline again. Also had to have my suitcase overnighted to me for $750.00.

### "It was the worst experience"
We had to turn back midway through the flight because of what I believe was an engine issue. I'm not sure what exactly occurred, as we were not informed. They didn’t communicate anything to us. Our next flight was scheduled for 3-4 hours later, but then it was announced that it would be rescheduled for the following day. They provided us with a $150 voucher to use for another flight with them and asked us to wait for another hour so they could arrange a hotel. They informed us that they had booked a room for us at South Point. We waited an hour and a half for the shuttle to take us there, and when we arrived, the front desk told us we had to pay for the room ourselves because Allegiant hadn’t covered it. It was a frustrating experience. Additionally, the check-in staff for Allegiant in Las Vegas wanted us to pay $210 for three small bags that I typically travel with for free. It was the worst experience I've had with them.

### “next available flight is 2 days away”
Allegiant cancelled my flight without telling us the reasons. The next available flight is 2 days away, the customers have to pay for the extra cost from hotel, car rental etc. I tried to call the agent to reschedule, but I was put on a hold for 2 hours, still nobody picked up my call!

### "frustrating and disappointing"
Such a frustrating and disappointing flight experience. Expect long delays and an uncomfortable flight. Departure flight was delayed by 3 hours (plane and gate changes, mechancal issues). They also told us it would only be 2 hour delay and has us start boarding then we got to sit on the plane wating to take off for another hour. No updates provided in that last delayed hour. On the return flight we paid $50/seat extra for the "extra" leg room seats only to find out the space for our feet was half the size of the other 'extra' legroom seats, so we still had a cramped feel and my under the seat bag didnt fit. Our seats were two asile seats, 2c and 2d, in case that helps anyone. Brutal experience. Do not recommend and we will not be flying them again. 1 out of 10 since they did actually get us to our destinations.

### "both trips were extremely frustrating"
Not Verified |  I flew Allegiant round trip from Appleton, WI to Sanford, Florida and back and both trips were extremely frustrating. Both flights were delayed for over an hour and then we had to sit and wait for maintenance issues for additional time both times.

### "the classic nickel and dime"
Allegiant is not much, if any, cheaper than major airlines once you factor all the stacked fees. And if you value your time, Allegiant is a loser. Allegiant Air's business model is the classic nickel and dime. If they could charge for air or light in the cabin, they would. I know planes are tens of millions and operation is terribly costly. Allegiant needs to make a profit. Their model is annoying and extremely wasteful of time negotiating ordering pitfalls, lack of customer service and persistently delayed flights. We were supposed to leave at 4 PM, at 7 PM we're still not off the ground.

### “changed their flight significantly”
Not Verified | I asked this question and was told no. I think it's reasonable considering the circumstances. This is my first time flying Allegiant. This flight was changed and now arrives just before midnight instead of 5pm. That's a pretty big difference. I'm traveling with my children and we had plans to drive up to Jacksonville for an appointment. I can change my plans, but I can't drive that late at night as it is unsafe for me to do so for many reasons. I looked into other options (other flights with Allegiant) and there aren't any. I get my girls on Friday 20th at 3:30pm and it's an hour to any airport from where we live. If I switch airlines at this point, it will cost me more than double to travel on the 20th or 21st. I am a single mom and can't afford to switch. I don't have a return flight with Allegiant because I had a discount with another airline that I used to make traveling during the holidays affordable for me. I'm just asking for either hotel accommodations, a similar price with another airline on 20th or 21st, or something to make up for the major change this is in our plans. I'd like to work something out that is fair to both of us since Allegiant changed their flight significantly.

### "I will never fly Allegiant again"
Not Verified |  I have a flight today that departs at 12:54pm. I was planning on adding my two bags under the airplane early this morning due to getting paid today. The allegiant app checked me in automatically, which means I am unable to check in my bags for the price of $50. I would have to check them in at the airport which will be $75 per bag. Now you would think that you would be able to get in contact with allegiant 24/7 customer service. Nope, no one answers. I have been sitting on the phone since 4:00 this morning. I wonder how many people had to be charged extra do to this issue. Allegiant should not be giving false information about their 24/7 customer service when they actually do not  have a 24/7 customer service rep answering customers calls. And this issue with the app automatically checking people in is outrageous. I will never fly Allegiant again.

### "only recommend this airline for select routes"
Could not check in (in Albany) because they were still checking in another flight. Unable to check in more than one flight at a time led to long lines and frustrated customers. Also, when we landed in St Petersburg (PIE) it took over an hour for our bags to come out. Absolutely unacceptable. I would only recommend this airline for select routes.

### "I am fully disappointed"
Not Verified | There was a carry on luggage bag size issue. I really didn't know that the size is not correct (which I'm still not sure) because when I checked it's dimensions on the scale it looks ok but the attendent told me that the size is bigger just by 1-2 inches. However I got charged twice for one luggage and the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE failed to refund me. They were just telling their terms and conditions bla bla. I am fully disappointed.

### "flight was canceled"
Not Verified |   After delaying our 6:20 flight three times, we got to the airport and received a text that the flight was canceled and rescheduled for 2:30 the following afternoon. They offered us $175 back plus a $100 flight voucher. Does not cover the hundreds of dollars lost for a car rental and Airbnb for the night plus missing an entire day of our vacation.

### "helped me when I got sick"
Not Verified |  Linda from Allegiant flight 2598 on August 8th, 2024 at 7:11 pm, was great. She helped me when I got sick on the way to Florida from Syracuse. I was so sick and she gave me a trash bag and took care of it. And no judgement.

### "disappointing and outrageous"
Not Verified |  On August 4, 2024, I was scheduled to return home to Virginia from Austin, Texas, on Allegiant Air flight 1516. Since it was a 2:34 PM flight, I arrived at the airport with my two daughters and my 78-year-old mother two hours early to check in and wait. Starting around 1:40 PM, boarding was repeatedly delayed due to various issues, and eventually, we were informed that the plane needed to fly to Houston for refueling. (Delays due to refueling are a very frequent occurrence with this airline!) Since my children had their school orientation the next day, it was crucial for us to get home. Despite several delay announcements, we waited at the airport for over 7 hours before being told that the flight was canceled due to weather. The weather in Austin at the time of departure was clear, and there were no issues at the destination. We were told it was due to Tropical Storm Debbie, but I learned that if the flight had departed on time, it would have been unaffected. The airline’s response was disappointing and outrageous. The ground staff shirked responsibility, directing us to call the service center to reschedule or request a refund, offering only a flight on Thursday or a refund. After 7 hours of waiting and growing frustration, I protested but was threatened with being removed from the airport by security, seemingly because of my Asian descent. We were eventually forced to leave the airport and had to contact relatives in Austin to pick us up. Desperate to get home, I persisted in contacting the service center. After three lengthy calls and an hour-and-a-half wait, I finally spoke with a representative who offered the same irresponsible options I had faced at the airport: “The earliest flight is on Sunday, or we can offer a full refund.” Are you saying the next available flight is on Sunday, August 11th? What about the additional lodging and travel expenses? Am I expected to cancel a flight I booked months in advance at a low price and find a last-minute, expensive one-way ticket? This is unreasonable. I demanded the quickest option to get close to home and refused to hang up. As a result, I was offered a flight to Pittsburgh at 6:30 AM the next day. I accepted and rented a car to drive approximately 190 miles home. Due to the airline’s refusal to take responsibility, I endured two days of delays and confusion at the airport and incurred additional costs, including $500 for the rental car.

### "extremely disappointing experience"
Not Verified |  I had an extremely disappointing experience with Allegiant Air that felt nothing short of a scam. My flight 1233 from Minot International (MOT) to Orlando Sanford International (SFB), scheduled to depart on Monday, 05 August 2024 at 5:43 PM, was delayed to 12:30 PM on Tuesday, 06 August 2024. This last-minute rescheduling caused me significant financial loss and inconvenience. As a self-employed professional, I rely on timely travel to manage my business commitments. The delay resulted in a full day’s lost earnings and additional expenses for accommodation, meals, and transportation. Despite their claims of prioritizing passenger safety, Allegiant Air showed no regard for the financial and personal impact their delays cause. To make matters worse, when I reached out to Allegiant for compensation, their response was dismissive and inadequate. This level of customer neglect and mismanagement is unacceptable, and I feel cheated by their false promises. I will certainly be taking my business elsewhere and advise others to do the same.

### "Delayed 3 hours"
Delayed 3 hours to get another plane. Overbooked flight while they begged for passengers to voluntarily reschedule. Landed at 7:54 pm should have been 4:47pm. After we landed it was lightning so when we were cleared there was no one to taxi in plane  By the time they got someone it was lightening again  So now currently still sitting here for an hour and a half on the runway. They said if we sit for 30 more minutes we get complimentary water and pretzels. I don’t want, I want off this plane.

### "make their phone hold times less?"
Not Verified |   Seriously, with the technical advances we have, they can't figure out how to make their phone hold times less? They can't figure out the logistics of seat assignments for different planes? They can't make refunds automatic when they have to change seats for their customers. I paid for front row seats months in advance and they can't refund me without a 45 minute hold time when they took those seats away? It's worth more money to fly another airline than to deal with their service.

### "overall experience was satisfactory"
During our recent flight from Myrtle Beach to Rickenbacker, the overall experience was satisfactory. The flight proceeded smoothly, with a seamless takeoff, landing, and minimal turbulence. Onboard, we had a team of four flight attendants, three of whom carried out their duties effectively. However, one of the attendants exhibited concerning behavior. She displayed signs that suggested she may have been under the influence of some substance, as her actions appeared erratic and unusual. Additionally, we overheard her speaking in a sharp tone, expressing frustration regarding passengers fastening their seat belts and storing their luggage. Throughout the duration of the flight, she maintained a displeased expression, causing several passengers to comment on her apparent state.

### "just lost our future business"
After a 5 hour delay and it may end up being longer, you just lost our future business. This has happened too many times. So many children here waiting to go to Disney and not one restaurant is open for them. What a rude, inconsiderate way to run an airline. Several here just experienced this same delay last Thursday. We have to call off work tomorrow because of this. You have no pilot even. Make this right to your customers.

### "return flight was was canceled"
Not Verified |   I fly into Fort Wayne, Indiana fine and on time. Apart from cramped seats the flight was acceptable. The departture flight was good. The return flight was was canceled less than 24 hours before departure. I needed to return by Monday and this was Sunday. Allegiant Air gave me a refund but not enough to pay for a last-minute flight on another airline. I was not happy. I was shocked as this never happened before.

### "first complaint I've ever had"
I paid in advance for a window seat, but it was going to be on the side of the plane in the sun. I wanted to sit on the shaded side so I went into the app and changed it about 2 1/2 hours before my flight. I changed to the very last row on the opposite side. I also paid for priority boarding so I could board quicker, and once I got back to my seat I noticed there was no window at all. There were 2 flight attendants in the back and I told them I wanted a window seat and asked if they could keep me posted as to whether one came available. I was originally going to be in seat 30A and changed to 32F. The seating chart showed one person in that row in the middle seat. All 3 of the seats in row 30 were empty until one young man came and sat in the original window seat I had until 2 1/2 hours earlier (30A). I would have been happy with any window seat at that time and I knew he was sitting in the wrong seat because he saw there was no one in the window so he moved over. I asked one of the flight attendants if she could just check with him to see if he was in the right seat. She said very rudely, that if they could accommodate they would, but she wasn't going to check everyone's tickets to be sure they were in the right seat. I told her that's not what I said or what I was asking. I told her I'm a bit claustrophobic and really wanted a window. She asked if someone had sat in my original seat, or how it was that I managed to get the one I was in. I tried to explain all of the above to her, but she just repeated she wasn't going to check everyone's ticket and they would let me know if there was another window available. I was just going to stay where I was at, but the other attendant found an empty window for me. I just got moved and then we had to de-plane for some issue, but that's unrelated. So, yes, I changed seats at the last minute. No, I didn't know there was no window in the very back. I simply asked if she could verify the seat if the gentleman in 30A, to be sure that's his correct seat. She said that if it wasn't, the person assigned to that seat would come and he'd have to move anyways. I have flown Allegiant for years and I've been their biggest advocate. Anytime someone turns to up their nose when I mention flying Allegiant, I have always said that I've never had any problems. This is the first complaint I've ever had. I've worked in customer service my entire life, and I know what good customer service is and this isn't it. This may sound very trivial, but it means something to me. I don't need this sarcasm when I've paid money to fly this airline. Asking to verify one person's seat is not asking too much. Just a note: all of the other crew members and airport staff were wonderful.

### "staff is always kind and helpful"
Allegiant is convenient when you like to avoid the larger, busy airports. The staff is always kind and helpful. That’s about the best I can say about Allegiant. The planes are so crowded due to the cheap fares that you are shoe horned into the seats. If you are sitting next to an average size American you probably won’t rest at all due to bumping into your fellow passengers in the adjacent seats. The seats are hard and uncomfortable, and leg room is minimal at best. There is no in flight entertainment other than people watching and the sounds of unhappy young children crying or screaming. My flight today was delayed. I was notified of the delay via email and text 2:15 hours beforehand, just as I arrived at the airport and had checked in my rental car. I had my family of 5 in tow and we ended up having to Uber back to our hotel who graciously allowed us to have our room back until 7 hours later when we had to head back to the airport. We were given meal vouchers which was a nice gesture, but I think transportation reimbursement would have been reasonable as I would not keep my family at the airport all day long.

### “very disappointed and dissatisfied”
When we first got to the IF airport, we were charged an extra 150 dollars to check our bags, and the man helping us said that our carry on is the right size and we wouldn’t have to pay for it. We then were boarding our flight, and the lady looked at us and said our bag was too big to be a carry on. She was very blunt and rude, and we asked about the other bags people were bringing in that were the same size. She said to put our bag on the measuring box to see, and when it went about an inch over she looked down on us. We then had to pay another 75 dollars for this carry on. She was not kind to us at all, not talking to us like real people. I’m very disappointed and dissatisfied with how she treated me and my 2 cousins, nobody should be talked down to that way.

### "Nickel and dime you to death"
Wish I could give a zero. Do yourself a favor travel with anyone but them. It won’t save you money because they will charge you carry on prices for your personal items. Nickel and dime you to death. Then lose your luggage. Not just one persons luggage lost…our entire planes luggage was lost for almost two hours to the point the police had to be dispatched. I will walk to Florida before I fly this airline again.

### "Do not recommend this airline"
There were over 20 infants on my flight and they screamed the entire flight, I didn’t pay for someone to bring their kids because it’s free to fly with a child under 2 so people inconvenience people with constant screaming. Do not recommend this airline.

### “claim to be pet friendly, but it was not”
Not Verified | Allegiant is very popular in my town as the only airline at our small airport. Direct flights into other small airports. It is well known that it's a no frills type of service. I have flown with them prior, and had no issues. But this time I traveled due to an ailing friend who died during my visit. I decided last minute that I couldn't let her cat go to a shelter. So we put her in an approved carrier and I paid to bring her home. She's a quiet gentle kitty, but was meowing as we boarded the loud plane. Though I hardly knew the cat, she had been quiet, only making noise when being moved around. So when the stewardess came to me and threatened to have me kicked off the plane if I didn't get her quieted immediately, I was shocked and dismayed. Already distraught over losing a friend, and now wondering and hoping I can make new kitty's presence work in my home, I sure didn't need someone making impossible demands. I had never flown with an animal like that. Some, more sympathetic passengers, offered advice of tranquilizers, etc. But I was in the pickle NOW. I really didn't want to miss this flight! They moved the passenger in front of me. But kitty quieted once we took off and hardly made a peep the rest of the flight. I was in tears off and on during the 2 hour flight, realizing this cat was all I had left of my friend. It made it difficult to communicate with passengers, or the crew. I realize that's a personal problem, but a real part of my experience, here. It is the next day, and I still feel traumatized by the whole ordeal. I wish they were more specific about pet travel in their policy explanation. I really had no clue that a generally quiet, but a temporarily meowing cat was reason to be removed from a plane! I have traveled with children and babies screaming, but never heard anyone suggest drugs to shut them up, and never a threat to kick them off! I will likely use Allegiant again because of the convenience. But I just want to forewarn others who might be considering taking a pet. They claim to be pet friendly, but it was not my experience.

### "Nothing good about it"
This is the first and last time flying this horrible airline. Nothing good about it. Prepare to pay as much for carry on bags as you do for the ticket.

### "biggest mistake ever"
Not Verified |   I'm a 100% disabled vet. Before my flight I had a medical emergency which I was hospitalized, which caused me to miss my flight. 45 mins on hold the day before flight, was told they couldn't do anything for me. Then was told to call back and use different numbers to get someone else. Just to be told same thing, only this time was told to go to website and email customer care. Just to be told there was nothing they could do for me or my family. So 2k later and no flight. This was my first and last time ever flying with this company. Had a similar issues like this with southwest and they were more then helpful. Wish I read a lot of these reviews before choosing to fly with this airline .. biggest mistake ever.

### "an absolute nightmare"
I recently had the unfortunate experience of flying with Allegiant Airlines, and it was nothing short of a nightmare. From the moment we arrived at the airport, it was clear that this was going to be a disastrous journey. Despite arriving more than two hours early for our flight, there were no staff members at the ticketing counter, and the line was outrageously long, stretching out the door. In a panic, we tried calling Allegiant's customer care line for assistance, only to be met with rude and hostile customer service representatives who seemed more interested in blaming us for the situation rather than helping. It was abundantly clear that the fault lay squarely with the airline for not having enough staff to handle the volume of passengers. After what felt like an eternity of waiting, we were finally able to speak with a supervisor, who was perhaps the most rude and dismissive person we encountered throughout this ordeal. Despite our pleas for assistance, he callously informed us that the next available flight wouldn't be for another five days, leaving us stranded at the airport with our 5-month-old baby and all of our belongings, including our car seat and stroller, which were already on the plane. To add insult to injury, Allegiant initially claimed that they had loaner car seats and strollers available to help alleviate our situation. However, when we asked for them, suddenly they had nothing of the sort, leaving us completely helpless and at their mercy. In summary, our experience with Allegiant Airlines was an absolute nightmare. From the lack of staff at the ticketing counter to the abysmal customer service and the complete disregard for our well-being as passengers, it was by far the worst travel experience we have ever endured. I would strongly advise anyone considering flying with Allegiant to think twice and explore other options, unless they enjoy being treated with disrespect and left stranded at the airport

### "never been treated so badly"
When i arrived at the airport they were not yet checking in my flight. I was about the 7th person in line. They said it would be at least 45 min before they started my flights check in. I couldn't stand that long so i went to the restroom and then outside to find a place to sit. By the time they opened check in the line was horribly long. There was only one person at the desk checking in an entire plane full of people and the line stretched past security for well over an hour. As a disabled person that marked on her reservation that i was in need of a wheelchair i attempted to use the priority check in lane because i am unable to stand for long periods of time without extreme pain. Even though there is a handicap sign on the priority check in lane i was told that because i don't have your credit card i would have to wait in the excessive line. I explained that i needed a wheel chair and was told that i could grab one myself and someone would come around to help me. I pointed out the handicap symbol on the priority sign and was told that i couldn't just skip the line (but apparently that's OK if i have your credit card? ). I sat in a wheelchair and moved myself through the long check in line as no one came to help me. I finally made it to the desk to check the bag i prepaid for and asked if someone was finally coming to help me get to the gate and was told to wheel myself to the side and just wait. They finished checking everyone in before taking me to the gate. The flight was delayed and i was the last person on the plane. I fly often and have never been treated so badly. No disabled passenger should be forced to stand in pain because they don't have your credit card. This is my first time flying your airline because it was the best option to get down to Destin but if i hadn't booked a round trip ticket it would have been the only flight i ever took with you.

### "Great experience"
Not Verified |   Great experience, no delays, great service, flight team member performed magic acts for passengers. I saw no issues with free carry on pieces with other passengers. Friendly service.

### “was told I had to move”
Paid for a seat and was told I had to move to accommodate a mother/daughter who did not pay for their seats. I was told loudly that I would have to move or continue to be petty and leave the plane. I’ve read reviews here that have reported the same senerio. Evidently this is an accepted practice within this airline and goes against their written advertisement where they encourage you to pay for your seat to “ guarantee your comfort and location onboard your flight”.

### "reps were rude to me and overreaching"
Not Verified |   I was very excited about the flight to Jacksonville to meet my first grandchild who was born on Tuesday, April 16. When I came up to the counter, probably to read the signs, A lady asked me if I was flying Allegiant, and where I was going. I told her that I was going to Jacksonville, and she said she was going there too. She said that she was from Afghanistan, and her English wasn't the best. She asked me if I would help her. I was happy to help since we were going to the same place, even though my plan was to hang out at the USO eating chips and drinking soda as I am a veteran's spouse. We both sat down until the counter reps came out and the line began to form. I checked in online before getting to the airport, so I checked my bag first. Then I stepped over to help the passenger from Afghanistan. While we were in line, I asked her if she had her boarding pass, and she only showed me her reservation, and I saw that she hadn't checked in yet. So, I tried to walk her through the steps to checkin online on her phone like I did. This took a while because I tried to explain step by step, and there were a lot of steps involved to check in. The check-in was interrupted when it was my turn at the counter. So we had to start over. The check-in was interrupted again when she got a phone call. So we had to start over again. It was very important for her to check in online to avoid the $75 charge for the 2nd bag she wanted to check. She preferred to pay the lower charge, $30, offered online. I tried explaining this to the Allegiant counter reps hoping that they would somehow make an exception, save her the trouble, and just let her pay the $30 at the counter. Instead of making an exception, they began questioning me and asking the passenger from Afghanistan about me. She told them several times that I was there to help. The counter reps were rude to me and overreaching. They reported me to security! The reps lied, reporting to security that I wouldn't allow her to talk to them. The passenger I helped spoke to the counter reps the whole time. I was just standing there to help and repeatedly trying to walk her through the check-in process on her phone. One of the reps tried to force me to render my boarding pass and ID unnecessarily. The passenger I helped explained several times that I was helping her. She apologized to me, the security officer who questioned me also apologized to me, however, the counter reps continued their weird behavior, taking pictures of me, and writing notes about me when I boarded the plane. It was unbelievable! I asked the passenger a couple of times if she still needed my help, and she said yes, so I stayed, since I said I would help. I was relieved when the counter reps finally checked her bags even though they did so by taking her phone and forcing her to download the app and on top of that also forced her to pay $5 for the boarding pass... I would think that she could access the boarding pass through the app. Anyways, I felt very uncomfortable and undervalued as a customer. I felt falsely accused of something I didn't do. It's still hard to believe, and it hurts a bit to be treated like a criminal when you're only trying to help someone. Allegiant Response, I am really sorry to hear about your experience, but thank you for letting us know. All of our team members are expected to be professional, respectful, and assist however they can. We truly regret that your experience contrasted with this. While I cannot

### "cannot check your bags more than 2 hours early"
No where is it posted that you cannot check your bags more than 2 hours early. We waited in line for 2 hours to check our bag only to be turned away and told we have to wait another 2 hours to check our bags. There is no where to sit or eat. We have 2 small children and had no where to go. The attendants taking the bags were incredibly rude and slow. Playing on their phones and talking with each other while the line was literally out the door. Once we came back to check our bags, again the attendant was rude. Our gate was changed without notice. The attendants working the gates didn’t even know it was changed. Again when asked they were rude giving the information.

### “have not had any bad flights”
Not Verified | I have flown on Allegiant many times. I like this airline and up to April 4th have not had any bad flights. Thursday afternoon (this is not the airlines fault) a small child was seated behind me kicking my seat and playing with the fold up tray through a 2 hr. 30 min. flight. What is the proper procedure to attempt to encourage the parents to make their child stop.

### "horrible customer service"
Flight delayed from one day to the next an almost 17 hour delay. Horrible customer service. Had to book a flight with another carrier to get home due to work, kids, etc. Absolutely horrible customer service and ended up costing almost an additional $900 due to this.

### "charged $75 for a book bag"
Not Verified |   Allegiant charged $75 for a book bag that should be free. It is smaller than their guidelines call for and easily fits under a seat. In fact, I flew last month with this same bag and contents for free. Yesterday, some very rude employee decided to be miserable and make everyone else miserable and told me the bag was oversized. He charged me $75 and wouldn’t listen to reason. Customer Service was a joke. They tried telling me the bag was oversized without even seeing it. They told me the maximum dimensions allowed before being charged. The bag I had was under that size. When I offered to send a picture with the measurements, they declined and wouldn’t discuss it further. I have always flown Allegiant and have their MasterCard. I will no longer fly with them and will happily give up my card. In the long run, they are no cheaper than any other airline. Stay away from them.

### "told her I paid for that seat"
Flew round trip. First flight delayed several hours before boarding- no water in bathrooms. once the problem was fixed, we boarded. After boarding completed, we then waited another 45 minutes because two luggage compartments would not stay closed. It took two men with proper paperwork to arrive with duct tape to secure the bins. No joke; duct tape. Return flight again delayed several hours. I purchased and pre-paid for an aisle seat in the front of the plane. Once seated, the attendant told me I needed to move over into the middle seat. I refused, told her I paid for that seat. She did not care. there was a husband that needed to sit with his wife (across the aisle) and I would be removed from the plane if I refused to move. As infuriating as the demand to move was, it was ten times more infuriating due to the cold, callous way in which she commanded me with nothing close to an apology for the inconvenience.

### "most rude and incompetent airline"
This is without a doubt the most rude and incompetent airline in existence. I have flown many different airlines across the years, including cheap airlines like Spirit, and Allegiant simply is not worth the money — no matter how cheap the flight, it is severely over-priced because this airline is garbage. On this occasion, I had to change my flight so I could leave a day earlier and I waited hours upon hours for someone to answer my call. Then this incompetent man, at some call center ex-US, disconnects me. I have to repeat the entire process, more hours spent waiting for someone to answer. I was on the phone all day, literally. So I finally get my flight changed and the incompetent man charges me to change the flight, despite that I had paid extra to be able to change my flight. So the man issues a credit to me for a future flight instead of a refund. Fast forward to my flight day and I am getting notices about my original flight, not the flight that I am headed to the airport for. So I go into the Allegiant app to see what is going on and even though I have a boarding pass for the new flight I am still booked on the old flight. Obviously a 9-year old can see the problem in this, but the incompetent Allegiant customer service rep cannot. So I attempt to cancel the the incorrect flight and I get a pop-up. It tells me it is too late to make changes and to call a special “back door” phone number. Here it is for you: 702-637-7038. My call is answered right away but by this time I am in my car headed to the airport. The agent, who is in the US, tells me that I am not actually on the flight that I am headed to the airport to board! I did mention that I have a boarding pass, right? Tell me how that happened! So she straightens everything out for me. She also tells me that the voucher the incompetent man emailed to me is unusable. So she sends a credit voucher that looks completely different. Now since I had a credit on Allegiant, I had to dreadfully fly with them one more time. But never will I ever fly with this lousy airline again. So this time around, everyone that I communicate at Allegiant via phone or email regarding my request for accommodation as a disabled person for seat assignment and medical equipment is extremely rude. And as a disabled person they gave me an extremely hard time about accommodating my medical needs. I had to threaten them three times with going to the authorities — they attempted to lie to me and tell me that they are complying with all applicable laws. I told them that I know my rights and I would not let them get away with violating them. Finally they acquiesced but to be insolent they assigned me a seat in the last row of the plane and it was all very unacceptable. I had previously told them many times over that I need a far forward aisle seat to accommodate my medical needs. They refused! Their website even states that they will assign the seat to accommodate a disability! I have flown a lot and used many different airlines. My request for accommodation as a disabled person has always been met with prompt polite service. Until I traveled on Allegiant. What a bad business.

### "had to pay 150 for the luggage"
I am a frequent flyer and used Allegiant check not luggage. I carry a backpack with two computers and a overcoat (weather dependent). I have placed this under my seat fully on over 50 Allegiant flights with no problems. This week I was last to board and as I entered the jet bridge someone started yelling at me and my companion (equal sized duffle). It was a gate attendant claiming we had to pay 150 for the luggage. We attempted to explain our history and show the size easily goes under the seat. The response was a hostile “if you want to fly tonight you have to pay for the luggage”. Extremely hostile. Feeling harassed and scammed, we paid to make our meeting. I followed up to the airline with pictures and requested clarification of policy. Their Customer Services team claims they can’t see/receive photos and it is staff discretion on luggage. Buyer beware.

### "never fly on this airline again"
Not Verified |   Every flight that I've been on for the last year with Allegiant the stewardesses are extremely rude. I tried to use $121 worth of vouchers today to make a flight to St. Petersburg. After multiple tries and being on hold for 48 minutes for help with their customer service, I was unable to use my voucher dollars. I've concluded that no matter how inexpensive Allegiant they're just not worth it. They can keep my $121 voucher and never intended to allow me to use it anyway. I will never fly on this airline again

### "Allegiant airport’s lack of security"
Not Verified |  Flight 945 went well, but when we landed in Pease airport in Portsmouth on February 5, 2024 @ 5:36 PM it was dark outside. Retrieved luggage, then went to go outside as directed for taxi service, to find there was construction work with a few cement barriers guiding passengers to get to the taxi service areas. No direction signs posted and no outside lighting to make it clear and safe for us to get around the construction to the taxi area located on the other side of the building nearby the “departing flights main entrance area. Pulling luggage around a dark area without any personnel to direct people through a dark outside parking area on a rough walking path is dangerous. We were completely shocked by Allegiant airport’s lack of security and safety precautions and measures for their customers. We are senior citizens and are completely shocked that an airline/airport had not ensured the safety of their customers/passengers.

### “next available flight was 3 days later”
Sat in the airport while flight was delayed for several hours to only hear the flight had been cancelled and the next available flight was 3 days later, which was when our return flight was scheduled. The pilot announced that they had to cancel due to a service issue causing a smell and that she wanted to be home by 8pm to put her kids to bed. In the meantime, my husband and I and our family are out $6000 for our vacation rental because we were not able to supply a 24 hr cancellation. When asking Allegiant about a refund for our vacation rental, we were basically told we were out of luck.

### "Worst experience ever"
When I got to the airport there was no one at the luggage counter to grab my checked bags that I paid for. So I had to bring them all through security. By the time I got to the terminal two staff wouldn’t let me on the flight claiming I was late when it was still grounded. They would not refund my $266. The manager was super rude & unprofessional. I went back to the bag counter & this staff just treated me like a loiterer when I was trying to get my refund & told me to leave the counter. I was inconvenienced my 10 year vacation that took weeks to plan along with hundreds of dollars for hotels with no resolution other than ”Your money is forfeited” from their customer service rep. Who clearly had no idea what she was doing after an excruciating painful wait time on hold. I had to wait hours for a cab because it was after a Packer game & they were the only cab in town. I emailed their customer service and got the same canned response. I asked repeatedly for a legal representation which they constantly dodged. Worst experience ever. I do not plan on, or recommend flying with this company ever. Spend the extra money & use a reputable airline that will actually let you on the flight you paid for instead of an off brand that profits & takes advantage of the average man.

### "customer service is none"
Not Verified |   On October 30, 2023 our flight 321 was cancelled from Nashville, TN to Cedar Rapids, IA. No reason was given and we were told to retrieve our baggage and prepare to stay overnight in Nashville. We were given two $50 vouchers for use on future Allegiant flights and also were sent an email for $175 compensation. That email content follows: Dear Valued Allegiant Traveler, We want to apologize for the inconvenience you experienced. In this instance, we did not meet our own expectations, and we are very sorry for the disruption it had on your travel plans. As a gesture of goodwill and demonstration of our sincere apology we have extended you additional compensation. To claim your funds, please select a payment option. Please click here. This link will expire in 48 hours. Our commitment to our customers is to provide a friendly, straightforward, safe and affordable travel experience. We are also committed to continuous improvement and hope you will give us an opportunity to better serve you in the future. Sincerely, The Allegiant Customer Care Team I followed the instructions carefully, choosing the virtual card. I received nothing after that message and trying to respond again to the link stated I had already been given the $175. The problem was, I never received anything further and since that time I have been trying to get someone to pay attention to my request to have this promised compensation delivered. I have contacted Allegiant customer service. I have contacted Paynuver customer service. I have been messaging via the Allegiant Facebook messaging link and have communicated with four different agents. I am told now that all agents are swamped with other issues so getting to my issue has taken a lower priority, if it has a priority at all. I simply want what was promised. I did not receive the $175 even though Allegiant records indicate I did. Nothing ever showed up to allow me to access the funds and I was told at one point (while communicating with Paynuver) that Paynuver would send the funds back to Allegiant so the process could be started again. The last Facebook message I received from Allegiant said..."Unfortunately, it is quite a process to get the funds reissued. Your information has already been sent to our Paynuver team and this will be reissued as soon as we can. We truly appreciate your patience. If this process is this difficult when a problem crops up, why would Allegiant continue using the same process? Why would they continue to make promises of compensation, when they can't deliver on that promise? I could not be more flustered about this and though Allegiant may claim customer service is second to none, I would maintain that customer service is none.

### "not to give us credit"
A travel advisory was issued for northeaster with anticipated 8 inches of snow - if our flight was cancelled or delayed we would not be able to return home for another 5 days. We called allegiant to change to an earlier flight, they acknowledged the snow storm but said I would lose all my money for my original flight. I even asked for just a credit as they now had 4 tickets unused for a flight but they also refused. One agent initially was going to at least give us a $230 credit but she then said she changed her mind, naturally my wife went off on her and she stated she would not our reservation so any future agents could see not to give us credit and then hung up. We tried talking to a supervisor but they never got on the phone as they refused. I’d strongly advise to avoid the lower cost and go with a reputable airline

### "$382 out the window"
Not Verified |  This airline has given me plenty to complain about over the years, but they fly out of a local airport so I have dealt with it. Just cancelled a flight due to weather. Outside of their seven day policy, otherwise you get nothing! $50 cancellation fee per passenger. (Not happy about it, but I can deal with it). $44 carrier usage fee per passenger. (Don't even know what that is, but I see no reason to pay for it when the flight has been cancelled). Then, they keep the $100 I paid to fly my dog. Are you kidding me? So $382 out the window, and to finish me off the turn what's left of my money into a voucher that must be used within twelve months, so I can feel the pain all over again.

### "airline is an absolute joke"
This flight back has been a nightmare! First they changed planes and told me that I had ton rechoose my seat after I paid extra for the front row for the leg room. Then when I got to the gate to board I was told that my paid carry on was too big and that I had to gate check it. The lady at the counter was extremely rude, told me it wasn't her problem that I didn't check in with her to make sure that it was okay even though I got the approval from another agent. When I got on board there were multiple bags that were in the overheads that were larger than mine. This airline is an absolute joke and a big rip off.

### “Wow what a rip off”
Not Verified | Wow what a rip off. So I had never flown with this airline before but they were offering significantly cheaper flights so took a chance. The mobile app was confusing and the option to check bags was grayed out. When we got to the airport I'm informed I could have checked bags online for $30 each but since I hadn't (grayed out) it would cost me $75 per bag. So I cough up this additional expense and then board. In flight I'm offered a beverage and snack and then charged per item. Nothing complimentary on this airline! Next I complete my trip and go to head home on my round trip flight and am informed my bags were not checked for round trip and I need to pay yet another $75 dollars. So my $200 flight ended up costing me right around $450 after all the hidden fees. What a scam these guys are running. Be warned.

### “Allegiant doesn't care for your plans”
Not Verified | Plane has been delayed for 3 hours now. Nobody is doing anything with airplane and so far I've lost my show tickets. All I want is a reimbursement. Allegiant doesn't care for your plans or you as a person. If they did they would reimbursement all of us. Never flying here again and don't recomend this airline. Time to expose them on social media.

### “What was your goal? To embarrass me?”
Not Verified |  We flew from Ft. Lauderdale to Norfolk VA on Nov. 28th on flight 496. I would give 1 star but giving 2 stars to Allegiant Air because the pilot landed the plane with perfection and most of the crew were nice except for one woman. This flight attendant walked all the way from the back of the plane to my seat just to tell me that I didn’t flush the toilet. Now, I remember flushing it and thinking “wow that’s so loud,” but maybe it didn't go down all the way or maybe I my pregnancy brain got the best of me and I actually didn’t flush. You would have thought I left something disgusting behind but it was only toilet paper. Either way, what gives you the audacity to walk all the way up to my seat to tell me that I forgot to flush in front of the other passengers? When I tell you that I thought I did, you continue to argue with me that I in fact did not. What was your goal? To embarrass me? To teach me a life lesson? Did you feel better about yourself after telling a paying customer that you all just cancelled a flight on the night before after waiting half a day in the airport only to have it cancelled after boarding because the crew was timed out? We got a free soda for our trouble and a rude crew member. My entire life I have worked in the service industry from being a server to ER nurse and I understand that sometimes we get annoyed with people but I have always treated them with dignity and respect. You are dealing with the public and you represent a company that is providing a service and without that service, you wouldn’t have a paycheck. Keep up the attitude and you will be flushing your career down the toilet.

### "they don’t seem to care"
Not Verified |  My wife and I flew to Illinois for a funeral for my best friend in high school. I requested wheel chair assistance. We had wheelchair assistance plus we were allowed to take my wife’s walker up the ramp & they would store it until we got to Rockford, I’ll. Upon our arrival at Rockford the plane emptied out and my wife and I were left on the plane as other assisted passenger’s were taken off the plane as no one came to help us. One of the crew members had to call down to the airport for assistance. On our trip back from Rockford to Punta Gorda we arrived in Punta Gorda and got up in line like other passengers. The stewardess very rudely said you have to wait until all the other passengers deplane before you can. Well, lady we were ignored on our flight up so why wouldn’t we push forward to the front of the plane to make sure we’re not forgotten. We along with others were assisted off the plane in Punta Gorda. When we got to the bottom of the ramp we looked down at our walker that had been unloaded only to find the brake handle had been broken. We filed a claim ticket for the broken walker. We have yet to hear from the airline about this claim. I took the walker to a shop in Fort Myers and the gentleman told me it would cost $85.00 dollars for him to send it into be fixed plus the cost of labor and parts. He said I would be better off to buy a new one. I ordered a brake handle online for $24.00 of which I couldn’t find the right one but was able to replace the handle but the brake does not work. Needless to say we will pay more for our flights rather than fly Allegiant again. This was a very bad experience and on top of everything they don’t seem to care. Their attitude is probably they don’t care as they have plenty of other passengers that will fly with them.

### "super frustrating!"
Not Verified |  I have flown Allegiant 4 times in 3 weeks- same personal item (backpack) each time with no issues. On my 5th flight I went to board and the gate agent said I needed to talk to another one of the gate agents - not knowing why? I was asked to put my bag in their measuring device / it was overstuffed a little and she said you have to pay $75 now or you won’t get on the plane. I was flabbergasted. I explained I purchased this this backpack for exactly this reason and made sure it was in their personal item measurement requirements. Her comment to me was - Well I guess you are just lucky for the the 1st 4 flights and saved money. I was shocked and very mad. Paid for the carryon so I didn’t miss my flight - Mad and frustrated - got in my seat, tested the size of my backpack and it fit under my seat in front of me, but put it in the overhead bin, since they made me pay $75 for a space in the bin. Let’s just say- the flight was not full, we waited on the tarmac 45 minutes to take off, because they had to check everyone’s boarding pass individually again because individuals had not shown up for the flight, and top it off the overhead bins were 1/2 full. So the fee they made me pay was more than my flight- how is that even right? To finish off my trip I had one more leg of my flights from Las Vegas to Provo, UT. Checked in with the exact same backpack as a personal item and had no issues with its size and it was put under the seat in front of me with no questions. I will not be flying with Allegiant Air anytime soon - super frustrating!

### “Not a single care given!”
Not Verified | TERRIBLE! Got on one plane, to sit for an hour to get off the plane, then wait 4 hours for another plane, to get on a plane to sit down and be told the pilot time is up and they can't fly. Got off flight called customer service 4 times in total, flight rebooked for the NEXT DAY! First told leaving at noon, then told leaving at 8am, then told ten am. Now I have no boarding pass, told to go wait in line. They do not care! All for a 1.25 hour flight. Waste of my time. I was on hold that long! Not a single care given!

### "Find another airline"
I had a family health emergency and had to cancel my flight. They refused to work with me refunding the ticket and issued a credit which I will not be able to use. Will lose the entire amount. Also, they are a “cheap” airline and the ticket indeed is cheap, however, you have to pay for your seat, your carry on, your checked baggage, and if you want priority boarding. Any food you want including water must be paid for. Find another airline!

### "planes are so dirty"
This airline should not even be allowed to fly. Bad service, flight attendants could not be worse, planes are so dirty that smell bad! When I boarded my seat was wet and greasy. Complained with flight attendant and all she did was to give me a piece of paper towel and advise me to clean it myself!! This was on flight 481 (FLL to AVL). On the return flight (496 AVL to FLL), boarding process started at 3:00 pm and was interrupted due to maintenance after 1:17h there is not even a agent at the gate and nobody had the courtesy to even provide an update. The worst is that this is just their routine. According to FAA chances of mechanic failures on Allegiant planes are 3.5 X higher than the average airline in the US. They changed the name but Allegiant Air is the same Las WestJet…

### "They should be ashamed"
As I have flown so many times with Allegiant Air, recently I flew with them for my girls trip to NC. They should be ashamed of how they “handle” their consistent, returning, paying customers. I boarded my flight, row 4, and as usual, no overhead space for my carry on luggage. The flight attendants offered no assistance in trying to find space in the overhead compartments, and said, “you just have to look”. They also do not police patrons who board first, sitting further back, who just wanna throw their luggage up in front by so they can just grab it and go once we’ve reached our destination. I flew with 2 friends who managed to find spots, I however did not, so my luggage was taken by a flight attendant, who said it would be complementary checked, and was then taken off the plane. When we arrived at our destination, I went to the baggage claim, and when I saw my luggage, I couldn’t believe my eyes! The handle on my luggage literally was snapped clean off. No note, no one to meet me to explain its condition, just my bag circling the carousel with the broken off handle laying on top of my luggage. Went to customer service, directed to the Allegiant counter, filled out the claim form and was told that a representative would be contacting me. Received an email requesting pictures, the cost of my luggage, my mailing address and phone number, which gave me hope that perhaps compensation would be made. I am sharing my experience along with pictures of the condition of my luggage before I boarded the plane and then when I claimed it at the airport. I followed the instructions I was given. Not to mention I paid a carry-on charge of $30 which I feel I should be refunded since they took my luggage off the plane. Following is an email I received from Allegiant. Allegiant Air takes no responsibility for or accepts any liability for damage to my luggage and basically blamed me for having what they say is luggage with wear and tear not sustainable to the various handlings of luggage. My luggage is not very old and in perfect condition. So I guess this means they feel it was susceptible to damage. Just wanted to warn fellow travelers of this unfortunate experience and hope no one requires customer service with Allegiant Airlines because it is awful.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. The flight there got canceled till the following morning due to fog, and the same thing happened on the way back. We had to book another night at the hotel last minute. The airline offered no accommodations and no refunds. They did not offer a refund for the hotel. Will never fly with them again.

### "I would recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  I had a problem with finding my flight. They spent time on the phone with me, very courteous and helpful until the issue was solved. They found me a window seat when I had not chosen a seat. Very important. They are so kind and helpful. They told me about deals for Veterans and were so friendly. I would recommend this airline to anyone. Thank you allegiant for a great experience.

### "they charge for everything"
Not Verified |  Worst airline. The price is cheap but they charge for everything. It even costs $5 to print a boarding pass. Delayed almost always. Cancels flights constantly.

### "One of the worst flights"
One of the worst flights of my life. The staff was selling alcohol to people that were already obviously drunk which resulted in obnoxious and rude yelling for two hours straight from a group of guys in their 60s. I paid so much money to check my bag, pay for a carry on (which I wasn't even allowed to put in the overhead bins because it was a duffel bag and they told me they had to make room for more bags), and I couldn't even get a glass of water.

### "worst customer service experience2
Not Verified |  So it became clear that I was not going to be able to make my Allegiant flight. Three weeks before the flight I called the airline. I prefer speaking directly to a human and was hoping that I could get through to someone, or that there would be a call back option. I was a bit surprised that there was no toll free number. I suppose I'd be happier to wait on hold if I knew it wasn't costing me money and if I had some rough idea about how long the wait would be. Anyway after 15 minutes on hold (and knowing that the meter was running) I decided to try a different approach. I sent an email with all my information and asked that someone from the airline please contact me at their earliest convenience. I assumed I would hear from someone. Two weeks later after not hearing anything I reached out via the chat option on your website. I explained my situation and my previous attempts to contact the airline and hoped that my situation would be successfully resolved. The agent who was handling my file could not have been less helpful. Turns out the flight was seven days from the chat day so she said that according to the terms of the deal she was not obligated to refund or credit any portion of the flight. She seemed to really enjoy sharing that part. When I tried to highlight the fact that I had unsuccessfully reached out on precious occasions and that I thought that should be taken into consideration she responded rudely and was extremely condescending. When I asked to speak with her supervisor she ended the chat. I tried to get back in touch expecting that you had other agents working there but I got her. When I insisted that my concerns were not adequately dealt with, and when I again asked to speak to either her boss or another agent, she refused and ended the chat. This is honestly the first negative review I have ever posted. I found this to literally be the worst customer service experience I have ever been a part of. I do understand that you're a discount airline, and that probably means that you can't allocate unlimited resources to your customer service department, but you should really try to hire people who genuinely care about your customers and also care about the reputation and image of your airline. The person I dealt with today very clearly cares about neither.

### "They refused to refund me the money"
I booked a round trip flight with Allegiant in July. I've used one way and canceled the other one which I got a voucher for. I went ahead and used my voucher to purchase a new flight. But guess what when I made it to the airport I could not check in because they told me my ticket was canceled by Allegiant, they did so without even notifying me! They canceled it for no reason and the lady at the airport told me I had to buy a new one at the counter for 300 dollars in order for me to board the flight! When I tried calling Allegiant, I spent an hour waiting for them to pick up, I ended missing the flight! They only told me they are sorry they will look for another flight for me. But they couldn’t give me a valid reason why they canceled the ticket! And they told me the next flight available was in 5 days! When I had a second flight to catch on the next day in Florida. I requested to speak to a supervisor, they told me no supervisor is available. The agent even told me that the supervisor will not take the call because he already told me everything. They refused to refund me the money. They didn’t care about me losing my next flight! They just didn’t care at all! They kept on saying we can give a voucher or put u on the next flight in 5 days! Really! This is the worst airplane.

### "We arrived in Albany and no pistol"
I always check to see if I can bring one of my pistols. The state of Tennessee allows this so I brought one with me for our trip and have done this many times. In Albany Airport the drill is bring the locked case to the counter of the airline you are flying, whoever is working the counter calls TSA, TSA agent arrives, I open the locked case and then the TSA agent calls one of the Albany County sheriff’s and both look at my drivers license and my pistol license a I fill out a TSA card and sign it, the signed card goes in the case and I lock it, receive a baggage claim ticket and the locked case goes with all bags. On Friday we arrive at the Nashville airport and go to the Allegiant counter where we checked our bags and I tell the folks at the counter that I’m checking my firearm. All 4 had a deer in the headlights look. Now mind you this is Tennessee, not Connecticut or Massachusetts or New York. None of them knew what to do. So, I told them that they needed to call a TSA agent. My wife and I waited for 10 minutes and another Allegiant employee arrives, he fills out some paperwork and has me sign it and then tells me to take the paperwork and my firearm thru TSA security and give it to one of the people at our gate I looked at my wife and looked back at him and said “Are you sure about this, I have never done this before.” He said “Yes.” So off we go to TSA security with locked firearm case in hand. When we get to TSA security I explain to the TSA agent what just took place and he looks at me wide eyed and says “That’s disconcerting.” I then hear people yelling and turn to see 2 of the people who were working the counter and they said “sorry you need to come back to the counter and check your pistol.” Now the Allegiant employee has me open the case looks at the handgun puts paperwork inside and I lock the case and he takes it. My wife says “Are you going to give us a baggage claim ticket?” He replies “No, I’m going to put it with your bags.” My wife “Are you sure?” He says “Yes.” We arrived in Albany and no pistol. I spoke to an Allegiant employee who said “Nashville is the worst Allegiant station in the country.” Of course my stomach is in knots because I’m worried that my handgun could be in the hands of a criminal. As I’m filling out paperwork my wife asks this gent “Should we file a police report?” He says “I would, these people need to learn a lesson and someone should be fired.” My wife locates 2 Albany County Sheriff deputies who come to the counter and I tell them the same story and both of them look at me in disbelief. The one sheriff walks away saying “let me make some phone calls.” Thank God for these 2 sheriffs. My pistol is in the hands of the Nashville PD, Thank the Lord. So tomorrow I have to call Nashville PD and speak to someone in charge of the evidence locker and have them ship it to an FFL. We also plan on calling Allegiant corporate headquarters and telling them the story. I have called Allegiant corporate headquarters multiple times and left multiple messages and no one has called me back.

### "I will never fly Allegiant again"
Found out I couldn’t have my carry on bag, they charge $75 to put anything in overhead storage. Delayed almost 4 hours. With the added cost of baggage I should’ve just flown Alaska. I will never fly Allegiant again. This has to be the worst airline in America.

### “The absolute worst airline”
Not Verified | The absolute worst airline ever in 70 years of travel. Their website is constantly down-I can't book a flight online; this was a problem for many people. I waited on their phone line for 50 minutes before getting a Rep. who put me on hold 11 times because he didn't know what he was doing.The flight attendants are rude to the point of ignoring you - unless they chastise you for crossing the line to wait for the restroom. The only reason for flying with them is proximity to my daughter, which is no longer a good enough reason.

### "horrendous customer service"
My luggage was lost flying home to Punta Gorda from Pittsburgh. After 2 weeks they still couldn’t find my luggage. After calling everyday and being on hold for 1-2 hours with no result. I was lied to by representatives saying it’s at Pittsburgh airport and I’ll receive it the next day which never happened. This was told to me over and over. I’ve left messages with no return calls. After the 2 weeks I emailed the CEO of Allegiant and all of a sudden I received an email almost ASAP saying my luggage is at the Pittsburgh airport and will go out today and I’ll receive it the next day which is today. Haven’t received it yet but we’ll see. Allegiant has horrendous customer service and they do not care for their traveling public. I will never fly with them again.

### "this company just doesn’t care"
Canceled flight 1 hour before boarding, called customer service 3 times each time on hold over an hour, last time 2 hours, this company just doesn’t care, never fly this airline again

### "a terrible experience"
Not Verified | My wife was hospitalized and waited over 12 combined hours to get a voucher for our flight and still are waiting on hold to speak with someone. The call timed out 3 times without being able to speak with a representative. The flight is today and we have been calling since yesterday morning to get this taken care of. As a valued credit card holder - this service is unacceptable. Regardless of system changes or updates, that should have been taken into consideration before making the change. This has been a terrible experience and am considering no longer being a credit card/frequent flyer member

### "No one wanted to help"
Not Verified |  Missed my flight because they never announced the change in gates. Sat there for 2.5 hours until I approached the counter and that is when I found out about it. Nobody could help me and they also told me that they didn’t care that I missed my flight. Employees at the airport and also customer service when I called to inform them were very unprofessional and rude. No one wanted to help and could care less about what me and my family were going through. They refused to refund my money and I had to spend an additional $1000 with another airline.

### "a no service airline"
With tripflex I tried to change my flight from September 7th to September 10th. I started at 10:00 a.m. in the morning and was never able to get the website to change my ticket. I gave up after 7pm. I called the only phone number and waited an hour and a half for someone to pick up to no avail. The plane left this morning without me. $200 plus down the drain. Fortunately a friend is driving home so I can hitch a ride back to Florida on the 9th. My daughter-in-law just tried to book tickets which she does on a regular basis and the travel agent said they do not book Allegiant ever. So my daughter-in-law tried to book her ticket which she has done many many times - again to no avail. How the heck are they still flying? This is a no service airline!

### "worst customer service"
Not Verified | The worst customer service on the planet. I was on hold for 3 hours spoke to two representatives who just push me along. Screwed my checking account up - charged me eight times for a flight. I had to go to my credit card company to make sure I get credits. I will never use again. I highly recommend no one ever uses a Allegiant.

### "I will never fly Allegiant again"
I was boarding my plane with my AED in one hand (I have a heart condition) and a bag of diabetic medical equipment (my wife has type 1 diabetes) in my other hand. I have flown with this equipment before as a free carry-on item both with Allegiant a few days prior and other airlines before then and have never once had to declare anything and have never been given any problems. As I board the plane, I walk by the stewardess. She looks me up and down and then turns to her friend and says "Here we go again. I can't believe people are trying to get free carry ons. Her friend responds with, "Yeah, maybe you should tell them to put that in the special bins on the outside of the plane. Implying to throw my medical equipment out of the plane. I was completely taken back but I did not want to get into an argument at this point so I did not say anything because I just wanted to get on my flight and go home. After a few minutes go by another stewardess comes up to me after I sat down and she starts asking me questions about what am I carrying and why. I explained that I have a heart condition and that my doctor recommends that I carry it with me but is not required. She leaves and after about 5 more minutes the gate attendant comes up to me asking to have a private conversation about what's going on so I walk off the plane with him. Side notes this has now gotten the attention of everyone on the plane and everyone was staring at me and probably wondering what's happening. The attendant precedes to start asking me very personal questions both medical and not medical which I do not want to repeat. They threatened to have me removed from the flight if I did not provide the information. All because I am carrying a medical device that was already approved by security. I am very upset at this point. I give them all of the information they ask for and then wait outside the plane for 15 minutes as they are talking both on the phone to people and in person. At this point the captain, airport security, 3 stewardesses, and gate attendant were all around me, the gate attendant was extremely rude and disrespectful. They finally let me back on the plane while my whole family is waiting and every single person on the flight is staring at me as I walk to my seat. One lady come up to the front as I was walking back on to ask "why did you take him off the plane? The only kind person that I talked to was the pilot, but everyone else was rude, mean, and disrespectful of my privacy. I will never fly Allegiant again. I have tried to call customer service multiple times and have sat on hold for multiple hours and never got to talk to someone.

### "Absolutely no accountability"
This was the worst flight experience I've ever had. The flight was delayed 14 hours, and not a single employee cared about anything. Not a single compensation, rewards points offer, free transfers, inter-airline communication, refund, or deal. They stranded 100-150 people in an airport and made it clear it wasn't their fault so everyone was on their own. Absolutely no accountability and the customer service line given was no further help but rather an echo that Allegiant doesn't care about its customers. Horrible airline, and I will never fly this airline again. Needless to say on top of that, they tried to charge me $75 for a carry-on after being delayed 14 hours and REFUSED to comp it. I only got out of it for being military but when I asked about compensating everyone else's, the manager ran away saying "if you have any suggestions let us know. Allegiant cares. As I was literally giving her a suggestion and she didn't care. Then even after we finally boarded the next day, we sat on the tarmac for ANOTHER hour with no update other than an announcement saying "if you're in a large group, can you tell us if you're missing someone? I presume they miscounted or someone was missing, but still no communication from the staff. AND THEN they boasted that the stale peanuts and soda was "on the house to make up for the delay.

### "quality customer service"
Not Verified | Fantastic crew provided quality customer service with smiles! I've flown multiple times in the last year on this airline. Highly recommend. Plane is always clean. Thanks for providing excellent service. Wish you weren't seasonal as I'd fly more with your airline.

### "Will never book with them again"
Not Verified |  Zero customer service. I was only told “no” about 10 times on the phone. Lady seemed to hate her job. Within 7 days you can’t pay for the difference in a flight. You have to pay full price for an additional flight. Will never book with them again. Spirit is a better airline and that’s sad.

### "Expect zero customer service"
Expect zero customer service or customer relations when you fly Allegiant. On July 1 my wife and I flew from Tampa to Portsmouth. The woman in the row with us took her dog out of its bag. The stewardess told her two times that pets must stay in their bag at all times but did nothing to make sure she complied. The dog had diarrhea all over the place, ruined my wife's running shoes and bag. Unbelievable, right? The woman apologized but set the soiled dog carrier on my wife's lap while she worked to clean up the mess. It reeked! The stewardess came over and spritzed some air freshener but did nothing to help us. When I contacted customer support requesting reimbursement or a voucher, an agent told us there would be no reimbursement or vouchers saying Allegiant "has no control over the behavior of passengers. I am totally shocked. Otherwise, Allegiant has always got us where we are going at the best price with no frills.

### "not worth any amount of savings”
Disaster. Third time wasn’t a charm. Got delayed in TSA mess and no attendants at the gate. Was there 18 minutes prior to the flight departure. Staff came out from the locked door and said they had a jam up in the jetway, couldn’t get in as they closed the door behind them. Watched the plane pull away for 18 minutes. I’ve had three flights cancelled… now sitting on hold for 30 minutes so far just to get a flight credit worth nothing. Avoid these people - not worth any amount of “savings”.

### "Don’t ever fly with Allegiant"
It was hell from the moment we entered the airport in Cincinnati. They had zero organization and when we finally got to our gate there was no one at the gate. There was no announcements and no gate agent with our take off time came and passed. Our flight crew arrived and they told everyone we’re just waiting on the gate agent. Where is this gate agent? No answers no information nothing. Don’t ever fly with Allegiant

### "Will never use Allegiant again"
After delaying our flight MULTIPLE times, when we finally got close to leaving they announced the flight has been cancelled due to no plane there to take us (for our scheduled flight). We lost $1,300+ for our hotel that they were not willing to give any compensation for due to them canceling our flight after we had been there for hours. Will never use Allegiant again. It will be worth the money to fly with a larger airline to ensure we are taken care of.

### "This is exactly how you lose loyal customers"
Not Verified |  Our flight was scheduled to leave at 6pm on June 30th. The gate was very full of excited people who were supposed to be flying to Fort Lauderdale. My husband checks his phone and sees the flight is delayed in the Allegiant app. I checked Flight Aware and Google which both said on time. I went to the desk at the gate and no one was there. I asked other passengers what was going on, they said they didn’t know either but someone who works for Allegiant was at the desk just long enough to tell them, “I don’t know what’s going on. Just sit still.” So they did. I checked the Departures board, said on time. 15 minutes later, everyone’s phones go off. Allegiant sent a TEXT to all passengers about the delay. Not one human interaction! We go get dinner. We are waiting in the USO for our now 8.18pm flight. I’m checking my phone every five minutes since not one person could tell us anything. 35 minutes before we should board, we get another TEXT. This time, it’s cancelled! I furiously went to the gate desk. Once again, not one human is there to tell us what’s going on. Just a lot of angry passengers. I ask any employee I can find, where can I get help? Every single person I asked said to Google it and call Allegiant. I tried but “due to the cancellation of your flight, we are experiencing high call volumes.” Couldn’t get through. Now we are panicking about where our luggage is. Once again not one person could tell us where it was. Finally, after my daughter and I ran to the baggage claim, I found a gentlemen who worked for the airport that pointed us in the right direction. My husband went to the Allegiant desk where you check in. They told him they didn’t know anything about the flight either but that everyone would get vouchers and $150. What about the money we spent on the vacation we were going to? All communication was via text! Shame on you Allegiant! My family has loved flying with this airline. This is exactly how you lose loyal customers.

### "I had no issue whatsoever"
Had two great flights and great experience from start to finish. Agent in Asheville on 6/19 was very friendly. No-frills flight was as expected, a no-frills flight from point A to point B. Return trip 6/26 was the same. Apparently, unbeknownst to me, there was a seating issue. Manuel and Jaelynne at Punta Gorda fixed without issue. They were friendly, kind, helpful and very respectful. Not sure why so many negative reviews online. I had no issue whatsoever.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. I flew with them a few times and every time they were delayed, and  I wouldn’t not recommend this airline. Bathroom are so dirty.

### "$40 dollars for boarding passes"
Not Verified | I have been so ripped off in my life. $90 for one bag going out and another $50 on the return. $40 dollars for boarding passes. I ever consider this airline again even if I have pay more up front.

### "12 hours waiting my second flight"
4 hour late in Las Vegas. I spent 12 hours waiting my second flight. Nobody had answers. First time I get a flight with this airline and last too. Terrible.

### "I will pay higher fares to avoid them"
This was my return trip and I was charged $50 at the gate for my “additional carry on bag”. I had a shoulder bag and a purse, both of which fit comfortably below the seat in front of me. I had both of these same bags on by first trip and was not charged. Ridiculous. They seemed to be very interested in getting everyone boarded early and as quickly as possible on both legs of the trip. The first leg we were able to leave early just to sit on the runway for an extra 30 minutes because there was no gate available. This trip we were rushed to board just so the gate staff and the flight attendants could chat while the pilots still got ready to depart. All the while we were stuck in our very uncomfortable seats without the ability to recline and practically on top of each other. Even the tray tables were more of a phone holder than a table, they were so small. You have to purchase even water, and there is no Wi-Fi or anything similar available. I can’t stand Southwest Airlines, but Allegiant makes Southwest look like a luxury airline. Taking Allegiant saves me 3 hours of driving to and from the airport and I will drive to a farther airport from now on and pay higher fares to avoid them.

### "So disappointing and astounding"
Not Verified |  I write reviews a lot online, and 95% of the time, I only write reviews for positive interactions. I feel that negative reviews are generally screwed by emotion, frustration, or anger. And that we have enough negativity in our world. So I try to keep things positive. In this case, I think it’s necessary to document the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced - which came from Allegiant phone customer service. I have never been treated so poorly by an employee of a company that I’ve spent hundreds of dollars patronizing (or any company, for that matter). There was a mix-up when my family flew in for a visit. Their return flight was canceled after they missed an outbound flight, and when we realized this (the night before their return flight), I called to understand the situation. Originally, the gate agent told them their return flight would not be canceled but that they could keep it. So we were surprised when we couldn’t find the reservation for them to check-in. The person who I talked to on the phone to try to fix the problem was unbelievably rude. After discussing the situation, she didn’t believe my family because the agent didn’t make notes, and her attitude toward me was unlike any experience I’ve ever had with a customer service person. I intentionally did my best to stay calm, not raise my voice or have a frustrated or angry tone and asked to speak with her supervisor after she yelled at me. After continuing to be berated by the employee, I calmly continued to ask to talk with her supervisor. She denied me the opportunity several times (she said the supervisor couldn’t help) and eventually *hung up the phone on me! * I understand and can appreciate how hard customer service jobs must be. So again, I did everything possible not to talk down to this person or raise my voice. And I was hung up on. I don’t understand how this airline could possibly prioritize basic respect for one another if this was how their employee acted. I assume they are not teaching patience or customer care (human care) in any fashion. Honestly, nobody should be treated with the disrespect this person showed. The way I was treated was not worth saving a little money to fly cheaply. I could not get this person's name or employee information and am not sure how to follow up on such an extreme situation, so I’m writing a review online in hopes of steering others away from such a challenging circumstance and genuinely negative interaction with another human being. Our world has enough trouble and challenges these days; there should be no reason to experience interactions like this one, especially in a professional setting. So disappointing and astounding that this happened.

### "flight was delayed by 4 hours"
Not Verified |  Our flight was delayed by 4 hours last minute. No compensation, customer service said they had no idea why the flight was delayed. Then, the departing flight from Vegas was Delayed an hour, and once we did board (an hour after that) We are all told that the air conditioning on the plane is broken. They're very quick to apologize for the inconveniences. First time flying Allegiant Air. Probably my last.

### "canceled it at the last minute"
Not Verified | I had a flight from Norfolk to Ft Lauderdale and they canceled it at the last minute supposedly due to bad weather in Florida, checking the weather map there is nothing true. It was the excuse of canceling the flight so as not to compensate, since I am afraid that I will have to buy a more expensive ticket because it is at the last minute.

### "nickel and dime you to death"
Not Verified | I will never book with Allegiant again. They kept me on hold for over 15 minutes on the telephone and via chat. I was told 2 different things by 2 different agents about a credit voucher after requesting to cancel a flight 7 days in advance due to my son’s medical emergency! I was only given a $108 credit for a $448 purchase. They nickel and dime you to death but are not flexible. The WORST airline with the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!

### "disrespect and a bad attitude"
Check in staff is horrible. They talk to you with disrespect and a bad attitude. It's like we are bothering them. Tried to add a bag online for 35 bucks but could not so i ended up paying 50 at the counter. Staff is always saying bad words regardless of young kids. They are disrespectful to military personnel. 1st and last time flying this airline. Not to mention the delays.

### "he decided not to fly at all"
Flight was originally scheduled May 12 from FNT to LAS. We received an update flight was being delayed reason given was that there was air traffic controller issue at LAS. FAA site confirmed that a runway had to be closed etc. The problem here is a few mins after the announcement I saw the pilot walk off the plane with all his belongings. But the gate agents continued to update as flight is delayed. Hours later the airline gave an update calling it an extended delay and the flight will not leave until May 13. I thought it was odd that the pilot who left never returned. Because the pilot got tired of waiting he decided not to fly at all. The crew from May 13 advised us of that. So we missed a vacation day, lost money on non-refundable tours, etc… all be use Allegiant pilot through a childish temper tantrum for a 3 hour delay. We could have flown and made it to the destination on May 12. Allegiant found a loop hole pertaining to cancellation of flight by calling it an extended delay vs. cancellation. So by doing so they avoid providing refunds for the trip. Not sure about anyone else, but if a scheduled flight does not leave the day it’s supposed to then that is a cancellation in my book. Allegiant ruined a part of my vacation and we only got a voucher that did not even come close at recovering the money we lost because of a single pilot was tired of waiting. I’m astonished that an airline who operates this way is still even around. . This is a low cost airline, and I know that you get what you pay for but there are limits to that even. On a good note airline had to call in a crew to fly us to LAS on their normal day off. That was about the only nice thing that came of this.

### "Next time, I’ll walk"
I would rather walk than take another Allegiant flight. My flight out was delayed 4 hours. We ended up spending more time sitting on the runway than actually traveling. I was running late for my returning flight (my fault) and I spoke to every employee I could find to help me make my flight. They said you’re going to have to run and maybe you’ll make it. So I was one of those people sprinting through the airport up and down stairs through crowds and I make it to the gate and they said we have a delay. Something they could have told me before I pushed my cardiovascular health to its limits. At this point we have a 2 hour delay because of “mechanical issues” with no end in sight. You always hear the cheap airlines are bad: Allegiant might be the worst of them all. If I could, I would rate them -10/10. I booked this flight in the first place in an act of desperation: it was the only option. Next time, I’ll walk.

### "Horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Was supposed to fly out 5/12/23. Flight was delayed for 2 hours with no explanation. Then, 3 hours after we were originally supposed to fly out, they cancelled the flight. The reason for the cancellation was there was not a flight crew scheduled to fly the plane. Not sure how it’s possible to book tickets for a flight when they can’t even provide the crew. Horrible experience and horrible communication from all Allegiant members.

### "my last time flying with Allegiant Air"
Not Verified |  We were supposed to board 5/12/23 at 1:15 pm and then they gave us an announcement that our flight got delayed and they didn’t know for how long the FDA delayed the flight due to high traffic. So you’re telling me every time there is a holiday you are going to delay/ cancel a flight because of high traffic? Ridiculous. Not to mention last time I flew with them I was stranded at the airport for 4 hours because they were fixing the brakes of the airplane and I didn’t get to my destination till 1 am. This will be my last time flying with Allegiant Air.

### "professional service and your sweet personality"
Not Verified |  My seat and aside of my seat had crushed potato chips all over it. I asked the Airline Stewardess if she could quickly clean it with a small vacuum cleaner. She said airlines don't have any. Alison didn't let that stop her. With a smile on her face and determination in her heart she cleaned it without holding up anyone boarding. Thank you Alison for your professional service and your sweet personality! You deserve a raise.

### "flight was delayed 2 times"
My flight was due to take off at 6.10, 05/05! The flight was delayed 2 times before they rescheduled while we are in the airport with 2 kids after 7pm due to maintenance which is understandable! Now when you reach out to get help rescheduled through customer service due to their inconvenience the representatives are so rude like you inconvenienced them or something! This was my sons 16th birthday trip and it has been nothing but a hassle! The didn’t want to help with the rental car I also booked through them to pick up on the 5th I asked for a supervisor wasn’t given one the smart mouth lady came back and said she issued a credit for my first day of the rental car which I haven’t seen!

### "unreliable and unprofessional choice"
I had an extremely frustrating experience with Allegiant's customer service when my bag was lost during a recent flight. It took weeks of back and forth in emails before the bag was finally shipped to my final destination. Throughout this process, I found that Allegiant's customer service team kept tossing the ball to each other, with no one taking responsibility or ownership of the issue. Despite my repeated attempts to get a resolution, there was no customer service whatsoever. No one was able to take responsibility and fix my issue. To add insult to injury, the file was closed on their system without issuing the refund I was promised. It was a complete nightmare, and I am extremely disappointed in the way Allegiant handled my case. Overall, I would strongly caution against using Allegiant for travel. Their lack of customer service and failure to issue refunds when necessary make them an unreliable and unprofessional choice. Save yourself the trouble and choose a different airline.

### "zero customer service"
Not Verified |  Worst airline I have even attempted to deal with. They broke my luggage on the way to Vegas. This can happen so no big deal however their count was vacant so I could not report it. We ended up mangling to carry and drag it to the parking lot. When returning for the flight back home, the counter agent was unable to help us with the issue and give us a number to call for support. I have called the number over 50 time with zero answer. Their online concierge is a joke and also can not support in any way. I have send several unanswered emails. This airline is a joke, they have zero customer service!

### "I will never fly your airline again"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight last year and had to cancel and they gave me a "voucher" which I was given a year to use. I just went in to book a flight to use my voucher but cannot do so through the portal. I am writing this review as I wait to talk to customer service and have been on hold for over an hour. What a disgrace and I hope the 400 bucks was worth it as I will never fly your airline again.

### "untrained and extremely rude employee"
I fly frequently and experienced the worst customer service ever with Allegiant. I had to go to the agent at the desk to get my boarding pass printed because my ID was not scanning with TSA. When I asked the agent at the desk to print my boarding pass she demanded that I pay for another bag. All I had was my small personal item and a paper bag with food in it ended up leaving my bag with my dinner in it because I didn’t want to pay the $50 charge for another bag. So ridiculous. It says right in the rules that you are allowed to bring food in addition to the personal item. Clearly an untrained and extremely rude employee. I submitted a complaint to Allegiant and got nowhere. Just a vague apology. I had requested to be reimbursed for the food that I had to inappropriately throw away. Just some reply about how they couldn’t possibly do anything else at this point. Zero effort to take responsibility for their untrained rude and inappropriate employee.

### "lying to customers"
Totally trash. They delayed for 2 hours first and then additional 3 hours. And it was only for 2 hours flight to Sarasota. They told that "there is heavy air traffic at Sarasota" but when I checked over Flight Radar there wasn't a huge amount of traffic. They are lying to customers.

### "The worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  The worst airline ever. Do not fly this airline unless you don't care if you make it to your destination. They canceled my flight today for no reason and no explanation given. They had no other alternative flights. This is the second time this has happened to me. They, by far, are the most unreliable airline. Service is poor and they run a cattle car system. Not worth the time or effort to trust this airlines with you travel needs.

### "I have nothing positive to say"
Canceled my outbound flight. Delayed over 5 hours on return. No snack or drink provided. No communication about the delays. Seats suck I have nothing positive to say about this entire travel experience. No one could tell us the time we were delayed too. The crew thought they were leaving and they tried to hold them. No one has any idea what is going on. No TV no nothing.

### "every flight has been delayed"
I had 3 of my employees on this flight, one just beat cancer and was still weak but she really wanted to come. We were supposed to fly out at 8:50 pm we got to the airport at 6:45 everything was OK tell a hour later when the first two hour delay happened, then from 11pm to 12am, then 1am, then 2, we boarded the plane at 4am sat in the plane another hour before taking off. We missed our car rental had to take a $300 uber straight to Orange County Convention Center so we wouldn't miss the education we were there for, zero sleep, we left the Convention at noon had to find a car to rent from there. I was so upset with the customer service I kept the rented car and drove back to Indiana 20 hours and several extra hotel meals. That delay if they would have told us from the start I could have made other flight plans, but we were told it won't be long now. So many times. When we did get on the plane they didn't give us any beverages and I'm even a Allegiant air card member, I have had 3 flights this year with them and every flight has been delayed.

### "canceled my flight for no reason"
Not Verified |  That canceled my flight for no reason and no explanation given. They had no other alternative flights and we had to buy very expensive flights from other airline. This is the second time this has happened to me.

### "They are very unreliable"
On flight home in 4/2023 left stranded 1350 mi from home. In early morning Hrs,- unable to access email, They canceled flight for no apparent reason other than under booked flight! Their only response was to refund my return trip and rebook me for 4 days later at an additional cost if $86 to me! No concern that I had to find hotel & transportation until then, at a cost of no less than $700 to me. They are very unreliable and not worth the risk

### "Never flying this airline again"
Awful experience, sat in the plane for 2.4 hours as they tried to repair a door that wouldn’t close, then a parking brake that wouldn’t disengage. They deboarded us and after about 45 mins had us board a different plane, and it had a problem with its door too. Another hour in the plane waiting for repairs. And then they wanted to charge us for sodas and chips. Found out our flight is late 60% of the time. Never flying this airline again, I can’t imagine they’ll be around very long anyway.

### "Do not use this airline"
Do not use this airline! Cancelation is frequent. Our flight was cancelled while we were at the airport, eaving us stranded for 2 days! My tickets were over $1000. They were gonna reimburse me $800.

### "This is the worst airline"
This is the worst airline. They cancelled my flight without notification. The pilot was too tired". While I am pleased the pilot didn't attempt to fly, the airline did not offer any other option. They sent a link for $175 for our inconvenience but the link does not work and in fact, expires! The very next day, the new itinerary, was moved from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm in the evening. Again, no notice and this time it was "the airport delay". For the pleasure of flying with Allegiant, I incurred over $1200 in additional travel expenses. Not one professional apology or effort to make the travel better. It doesn't matter that individuals had deadlines and places to be and they could care less. The final straw, we had rebook the flight because the second flight was cancelled. They had the nerve to recharge us! Unbelievable. Trust me, you get what you pay for with this airline. Just pay Delta; get to your destination without worrying about this BS.

### "Allegiant rep was very rude"
Allegiant Air managed to lose my luggage in nostop flight. There is no luggage counter in Indianapolis, so I went to the 2nd floor to the ticket counter. The Allegiant rep was very rude to me, threatening to call the police if I will not leave without my luggage.

### "Highly do not recommend"
Highly do not recommend! Our flight delayed twice and then canceled last minute due to “maintenance issues.” They didn’t offer anyone accommodations and only offered a $200 refund. My family and I are now stuck driving 12 hours home tomorrow with my special needs child after finally finding a rental car and being stranded.

### "We will never ever use them again"
Not Verified |  At 4 o’clock in the morning we received a cancellation of our flight for a flight that was to leave at 7 AM in the morning. We were offered no other options for other flights. The best they could do was three days later .. now scrambling to try to find a way to get home. We will never ever use them again

### "Disappointed an understatement"
Not Verified | Absolutely horrible airline - their staff’s negligence and incompetencies lead to 60+ minutes sitting on the tarmac due to 10,000 POUNDS of over-fuelling; with no air circulation, compensation offerings (on, or off the plane), and the demand for a de-plane with a subsequent 2+ hour delay. Their excessive and inexcusable oversight caused countless missed flights, canceled classes, and over-heated, parched, passengers. The least they could do is offer SOME compensation for their passengers for their mistake(s), but that never came. Disappointed is an understatement, I will never be flying with them again.

### "currently having to drive 16hrs straight home"
Do not take this airline! Canceled our flight 1 hour before we were supposed to depart and their excuse was they "didn't have enough staff". Told us there wasn't going to be another one until 10pm on Monday when it was currently Saturday. We had to rent a car and are currently having to drive 16hrs straight home. They didn't even care to cover the cost for all the extra money we had to spend because they were unorganized and irresponsible. Take my advice and spend the extra money on a good airline! I have to give them 1 star to submit but they deserve a big 0!

### "our bags never made it onto the plane"
Not Verified |  A friend of mine and I traveled to Florida for a golf trip in January of 2023. We arrived several hours before our flight boarded. We dropped our bags off at the ticket counter as usual and proceeded to board our flight. When we arrived in Florida we discovered that our bags never made it onto the plane. Allegiant offered to put them on the next plane to Destin, but that was Sunday evening and we were returning Monday and our bags would do us no good at that point. We were told by the agents at the ticket counter in Florida that we could purchase whatever we were missing and we would be reimbursed. We were told that we would be reimbursed for the baggage fee since they never sent our bags. It's been months since I've sent our information to be reimbursed without any response. I've emailed, called, and left messages with nothing in return.

### "Very satisfied"
Not Verified | Clean, courteous. 30 min boarding delay. Fastest direct flight ever! 3hr 19 min. Upgrade for extended leg room in rows 1-7 worth it! Free drink. Very satisfied. No WIFI. Seats don’t recline.

### "I wouldn't recommend it to anyone"
My flight was delayed and I had to wait in the airport for seven hours. I emailed Allegiant to ask if there was anything they could do to make this situation right, but they told me the case was closed and I wasn't entitled to anything per company policy. I will not be flying this airline again, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

### "Terrible experience"
I'll preface this by saying the crew was fantastic. Unfortunately that's the only positive. First, they charge 50 bucks for carry on. I got that free on the flight to Austin with Alaska. Then a gate agent called too many zones at once and it turned into a big mess. On-board it was cramped and the seats are just metal with fabric. My back is feeling it today. And there is no wifi nor even a tiny snack or cup of water available, even water is pay only. Terrible experience. Shouldn't exist as an airline.

### "The worst airline ever"
The worst airline ever. Plane was dirty, crumbs on the seats. Stewardess were extremely rude. By the time you pay for the check in bags, the carry on bag, and then tried to charge me for my purse because it was a personal item. Zero form of entertainment, and 400% up charge on snacks and drinks simply makes the cheap tickets worthless.

### "I do not recommend this airline"
Horrible experience, I flew with my wife and 3 children, The flight was set to board at 6:15 and it didn’t. Then once boarded it took about an hour to fly out. When we finally flew out everything was fine until the pilot flew into a storm and did not even warn the passengers or flight attendants who were in the aisle selling beverages with the cart. The Turbulence was horrible and out of nowhere the plane dropped several feet in the air with passengers scared to death and screaming. My children had a horrible scary experience, the pilot finally tells everyone he is in a storm and to buckle up that if he has to descend and land he will but for now buckle up and stay in your seats the flight attendants had to run back to there seats and secure the drink cart. Very horrible trip. I do not recommend this airline to anyone.

### "the worst I have ever experienced"
This flight was the worst I have ever experienced in my entire life, my children were scared to death, it was super late to board and fly out. The pilot gave no warning of an upcoming storm and while the flight attendants were out giving drinks the entire plane dropped several feet and the people on the plane screamed in fear. My baby woke up scared to death and my two other children yelled. They continued to fly in the storm instead of go around it and put us all in danger. Do not fly Allegiant.

### "the most unreliable airline"
Allegiant Air is absolutely horrible - they leave people stranded all the time - twice now they have cancelled my flight from West Palm Beach to Minneapolis in the month of March, 2023! They are the most unreliable airline that I have ever flown - do not trust them at all - they will cancel your flight less than two hours before you are to leave and for no reason at all - they never respond to emails, phone calls (after being on hold for 4 hours), or Facebook Messenger! They need help - some other airline needs to buy them now!

### "Cheap Rude Airline"
Not Verified |  Cheap Rude Airline. When they cancel for maintenance or weather. They do strand you. They will not help you get home. They might give you a voucher to fly again for a portion. (If you can get a hold of them). Cost me $800 for 2 people to get home when they canceled the flight for maintenance. Originally cost $200ish round trip. One year prior, they did the same to us. Cost us an extra $400 then. Different airport. Will never fly again. Was offered $10.00 refund for our flight home this time. Ask to talk to a supervisor, and they will say no, take it leave, or they will hang up the call was their response.

### "shorted us $15 on the refund"
Not Verified |  We've been using Allegiant Air for a while now. We recently booked two flights and it automatically upgraded us to some weird bundle, which resulted in almost a $200 up charge. Naturally, we cancelled and rebooked. The only problem was that we used some of our points to book the first time. Not only did we not get our points back, they shorted us $15 on the refund. We waited for hours on the phone to talk with someone. Never even got through. Very annoying.

### "Minimal space for seating"
Not Verified |  Don't fly with this airline unless you want to be 1-3 hours late. The flight to and from were both delayed 1-2 hours. The flight arrivals were 1 hour late and you spend another hour sitting in the plane waiting for it to start moving. Minimal space for seating, smallest tray tables I've seen on any flight, and they will charge you for beverages or food/snacks. They offer no in flight entertainment. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money for a much better airline.

### "absolute worst experience"
I absolutely hate Allegiant. Our flight has been delayed traveling both ways. I have been delayed for hours now and still no notification (email or text) that the flight was delayed. The absolute worst experience I have ever had flying.

### "I’ll forever be grateful for them"
I was recently on an Allegiant flight from Asheville NC to Minneapolis MN (Flight 237). I was feeling nauseous after 45 minutes into the flight so I got up to use the restroom in the rear of the plane. Once I got to the back i became extremely dizzy and I blacked out. I could hear people talking to me but I couldn’t see anything. The Allegiant flight attendants acted fast to put an oxygen mask on me and laid me down on the floor. I believe two nurses were on my flight too who checked my pulse and blood pressure. I wish I knew their names so I could thank them for jumping up to make sure I was ok. Very scary moment for me but everyone who helped me made sure I was comfortable as I came back to and I’ll forever be grateful for them.

### "This is unacceptable!"
Allegiant is the absolute worst airline. My boarding pass said to to board at 7.20 am and to be there 2 hours prior. Showed up on time, waited for over an hour and no Allegiant employee ever showed up to check myself and my bags in. This is unacceptable! This was supposed to be a surprise birthday trip for my elderly grandmother and this companies lack of compassion for its clientele has ruined it! This is a weekend I will never get back!

### "having computer issues"
Not Verified | Been on vacation to Punta Cana. Get to the airport and check in at 10:30 am for a 1:00 pm flight home. Sat on the plane for 2 hours while they explain to us that they're having computer issues. After 2 hours they make us all disembark from the plane and haven't given us a status, just keep pushing the time out. First time ever flying with this airline, will be the last. I'd be willing to fly the Three Stooges airline if there eas such a thing, before ever flying Allegiant again.

### "non-existent customer service"
Not Verified |  I am pretty sure that the Allegiant Air executives do not care to read or to pay attention to the reviews of their airline - for them, the revenue and the profit is the most important. Not the passengers. Not the service. I was scheduled to fly from Harrisburg, PA, to Ft. Lauderdale, FL on March 2nd - Allegiant flight #507 leaving at 6:26pm. Without any notifications or warnings, the flight has been re-scheduled 8 times for the departure at 10:45pm (more than 4 hrs delay). At the same time, there was NO ONE from the airline at the gate to convey/explain the delay or to communicate any related information. I've tried to chat with the customer service via the website but to no avail ("sorry, our agents are not currently available"), tried calling the customer service - waited for 1.5 hrs to no avail either. Overall, it is an ultra low cost airline (although I paid a pretty hefty price for a one way ticket - the same as on United Airlines in opposite direction) with a non-existent customer service and the lack of responsibilities. If you are enjoying spending long-long hours being delayed and arriving in the middle of night (2-3am instead of 9pm), having "zero" customer service - yes, choose Allegiant Air!

### "I'm through with Allegiant"
Not Verified |  Flight 1911 originating in Bangor Maine. Scheduled to take off at approximately 3:40pm on 2/28/23. 90 Min delay right off the bat. Then another delay and another delay. Then boarding takes place and we have to be de iced. Had to get in line for that. waited an hour then went to runway, waited so long there de icing had expired. Back to De icing area, sat and waited. Never happened. Then Flt attendant said airport closing for an hour. Back to the gate, deplaned. After a while boarded again. Went to de ice. Never happened. Say for 30 or 40 min. Back to the gate. Flight attendant says they ran out of de icer. Please keep in mind this is Bangor Maine in mid winter. Flight is finally delayed until 3/1 at 1 pm. 3/1 1pm no plane2:30 still no plane. in the meantime, their flight scheduled for 31 are taking off. Customer service rep tells us that they are flying a plane in from Pennsylvania to finally take us to our destination over 24 hours late. I've spent the better part of two days now at the Bangor airport and I'm not spending any more and so I asked for my bags back, and I rebook with a flight to Tampa on Thursday evening. And I drag all my bags back to the car and leave just spend another night in the motel and then I think better of what I've done and so I cancel everything, including the booking that I made for the end of March, I'm through with Allegiant. The customer service people were very nice and unfortunately they are trapped with the angry customer so they have the worst job of anyone. In fact, I just acquired and allegiant air credit card because I was using the airline so much and I will be cutting that up in the very short pieces and sending it to someone with instructions on what they could possibly do with it.

### "I would not fly them again"
I was set to fly and when I got to the airport my service dog was denied. I asked why and the attendant had no idea. I lost the flight. I have trying to get in touch and that is a laugh. They do not return emails or answer the phone. I have sat on the phone for hours and no attendant. I have lost the $500 and I have tried to reach out to them and they just ignore you. I would not fly them again.

### "an awful flight there and back"
I will never fly Allegiant again. Was an awful flight there and back. First flight had 3 drunk guys sitting behind us at 9am. Many complaints but flight crew didn't do anything about it. They would rather save 3 than the many who sat around them behind bothered by the yelling and bad language. The flight back was even worse. The people directly behind us had a medium size dog that whined and yelped loudly the entire 2.5 hour trip. The dog was under my seat so it was even louder for me. The owners only were addressed by the crew when they were caught with the dog sitting openly on their lap. Not being bad enough, the dog was also passing gas. One of the requirements listed on Allegiants website is the animal must be "non disruptive". This definitely was not the case and the flight crew was not eager to do anything about it. Not to mention that both of us are allergic and were sneezing. I did reach out to Allegiant with my complaint. Their answer was shocking and dismissive to say the least. They pretty much said, in short, that it's my problem and they did nothing wrong. I asked to speak to someone else and I've been brushed off. Again, they are going to lose passengers to save the feelings of two people. This isn't very good business!

### "Poor planning, horrible customer service"
By far the worst airline and service. We flew to Plattsburgh from Florida and back to Florida- without landing. Apparently, conditions were too icy to land in NY so the entire plane was flown back to its Florida destination. We had been on the plane since 7 am and during the now 7 hour flight we were offered complimentary pretzels and water. Everyone’s trip was ruined, we were exhausted, and hungry sitting in seats with no cushion, and that’s the best they could do. Also - did no one check conditions before that plane took off? And why could it not have rerouted to Allegiant Albany terminal which was fully operational? Poor planning, horrible customer service, and the most god awful experience I’ve ever had. You’d be better off walking.

### "first and last trip with them"
On my return flight from Puerta Gorda to Nashville, their baggage handling destroyed my Samsonite, indestructible up to their handling, Hardcastle golf case on the return trip to Nashville. Instead of having a complaint Baggage claim desk near Baggage claim, I was forced to drag my damaged golf case as well as my other luggage back upstairs too the ticketing, Check-In desk to file a claim. The attendant, while being one of the most pleasant people was unable to file a claim. They took my information and was told, we will contact you. For those who purchase Samsonite products, you have to believe they purposely destroyed my property. That case, over the last two years has been in 3 different continents. Only Allegiant managed to damage my property. I have no doubt that they will not contact me nor provide, at the very least, repair my golf case. This was my first and last trip with them. They are cheap in every meaning of the word. Next time I will pay more to land farther away from my destination, rent a vehicle and arrive happier.

### "Allegiant doesn't care about their customers time"
We had a morning flight that they screwed up sending the check in email. We went to check in at the desk and they wouldn't do it because it was “too close to boarding time”. Funny thing is, boarding hadn't even started and the flight wasn't scheduled to leave for 43 more minutes. Keep in mind this is a tiny airport, and going through security and getting to the gate takes 10 minutes or less. But anyway, they wouldn't do it and so we had to reschedule for a later flight. We came back a few hours later and and waited at the gate only to be told that our flight was canceled because they needed to do maintenance on the plane. The next flight wouldn't depart for another 7 hours. In short, Allegiant doesn't care about their customers time or inconvenience, and they definitely don't care about good communication.

### "will never fly Allegiant again"
We were ticketed for the early morning flight from Provo to Mesa. Rcvd and email saying time to check in so the night before we did our check-in. Silky smooth using the Allegiant app. All good, flight says on time, this is about midnight for an 8:15am departure. We show up at the airport to do the bag drop but there is no bag drop line. Just one line for ticketing, checkin and bags. We wait in line and after about 20 mins an agent calls out anyone on the Mesa flight has to see her. Turns out the flight the night before was 8 hours late so our flight was getting bumped 12 hours. Didn't we get the email? (no email, no text, no alert on the app.) None of the other passengers we talked with had any notice either. Agent offered to book us on their noon flight but that flight is full. The event we were traveling for was for tonight so our plans were blown up totally. We offered to drive to SLC to get a flight on another airline but they were unwilling to book us. Told we should be getting a $100 voucher and our tickets would be refunded in a week or so. And if we don't get refunded come on back in and they will work on it. Last minute pricing and flight available prevented us from rebooking ourselves so home we go. Love flying out of the smaller regional airports but will never fly Allegiant again.

### "beyond infuriated with our experience"
My husband and I were seated towards the back of the plane. Row 25 to be exact. It was a full flight. No issues there. However, during take off one of the other passengers managed to leave an open alcoholic beverage in the overhead carry on area. This alcoholic beverage found its way 2 seats back to pour onto my husband and I. I do mean poured on us!! Overhead luggage was soaked in what smelled to be whiskey and so were our clothes. Let me also add that my husband is 11 days out of Alcohol rehab! So needless to say this caused even more issues to the 3 screaming babies on board and the 4 very intoxicated passengers surrounding us. Those are things we could have handled and expected, but to be doused by alcohol during take off and to return home with our luggage soaked in it was infuriating. To add insult to injury, when we brought it to the flight attendants attention, she was attentive to drying out the over head bins with paper towels but never offered to hand us something to dry off with. I am beyond infuriated with our experience with this airline!

### "denied access to the flight"
Not Verified |  They absolutely refused to check the dimensions of my wife's bag, but insisted that it was too big. We measured it beforehand to assure it was the proper size. They tried to strong arm us into paying $100 for the bag. We even re-arranged items between our group to fit their request, but the worker still refused to check the bag. Needless to say we were denied access to the flight, and were told there was no refund.

### "gate agent ruined the whole trip"
The flight was on time and most things were perfect. Unfortunately there was a gate agent who ruined the whole trip. I was traveling with my wife and we both had small carryon bags, about half the size of a 20" piece of luggage. My wife had a very small over the shoulder bag, about a tenth the size of most purses. I decided to help my wife with her bag and carry it for her when we moved up to scan our tickets. The gate agent forced us to get back off the jetway and jam the tiny bag into one of other bags. I'm pretty sure when I was checking things out that 2 bags were allowed per person so either he was stupid and couldn't figure out that each of the larger bags belonged to 1 person, or he just decided to be a jerk. My money is on the latter. We had been polite and compliant up until that point. We did what he asked but made sure he knew we weren't happy about it. There was a long line of people behind us as well and I don't know they could have interpreted the gate agent's actions any other way than being a jerk. Once back on the jetway, I was not quiet about my displeasure either.

### "comical, unbelievable errors"
My daughter flew from Phoenix to Idaho Falls flight 636, Jan 3rd. Here is the sequence of comical, unbelievable errors by Allegiant, but most disturbing was the nonchalant attitude with no communication and mitigation to the errors. -Flight was late (not usually that big of a deal). After arriving, she waited over two hours for a "paid" check baggage, with no communication at all on eta or reason from Allegiant staff. She had been picked up by a mother with a baby, so they had to call it a night after 2.5 hrs. A passenger wandered out to the Tarmac to see if he could get info about what was going on .The passenger came back and reported that there may have been an accident with the ground crew, that Allegiant was short staffed, and they had no ETA. At no time did Allegiant send a message to my daughter through Text or the App (even though you have her information, and knew she checked a bag - With no information, and with no-one at Allegiant Airport picking up the phone or calling us back (we left messages) the communication was completely irresponsible and non-sympathetic to the passenger schedules (like college classes). I called twice myself and no one returned calls. She went back, paid for transportation there on the next day, Jan 4th, but no one from Allegiant was there (couldn't you pay for 1 staff to be there to hand out luggage?) She found airport staff who said they couldn't help, but to come back on Friday the 5th at 9am or 2pm when Allegiant had a flight and therefore staff. Turns out there was no flight in the afternoon, but we were lucky and we stumbled onto that fact, no thanks to Allegiant, so she went in the morning. Why couldn't Allegiant take action to at least communicate? To deliver the baggage would have been even more helpful, even it was for a fee. Why not use the system which knows she checked a bag? Why didn't someone the night of the Arrival come tell the passengers "we had an accident, we are short staffed, Allegiant doesn't offer services (or care) so come back when we have a flight so that you can stand in line and have an agent help you get your luggage that we will hang on to for 2 days and have you at our convenience come get it, taking a chance on when you arrive because we don't communicate because walking to the waiting customers or sending an email or text is too expensive. Please let me know what happened, and why. I tried contacting Allegiant but they won't answer via phone nor email.

### "extremely frustrating experience"
I had an extremely frustrating experience with Allegiant's customer service and refund process. After I could not check my bag 45 minutes before my flight, thus not being able to board, I spent hours on the phone trying to reach a representative to assist me with an insurance refund. When I finally got through, the customer service agent was unhelpful and dismissive, offering little to no assistance. Furthermore, when I requested a refund, I was told I needed to cancel my flight an hour before takeoff. If I knew I could not check my bag 45 minutes before the flight, I would have done so. Overall, the customer service and refund process provided by Allegiant was utterly unsatisfactory, and I will not be choosing to fly with you in the future.

### "Allegiant will not help with anything"
Not Verified |  Allegiant ended up cancelling the flight for my son and his girlfriend to fly back to school due to weather. Allegiant customer service informed them that they will not be rescheduling the flight and they would have to travel to Vegas or Arizona to get a flight instead. Now we all understand that weather can cause these issues but after taking with customer service they informed them that they will not help with a rental or flying my son to either Vegas or Arizona. I spoke to a manager after learning what they told my son and she came on the phone really aggressive and just straight told me that Allegiant will not do anything to help them and they will refund our money. But at this time the cost to get a new ticket is 3 times as much as what they are going to refund us. When I informed her of all extra costs, extra stay, and now a rental car to drive to Arizona, she told me that that is all on us and Allegiant will not help with anything. Then I asked her if she would be ok if her kids were stranded somewhere and their airlines wouldn’t help them. She then got really hostile and and tried to hang up. We have flown them a few times but I can assure you that me nor anyone in my family will fly them again. We have 3 kids in college that play sports and we fly a lot. Allegiant will never be getting our business again. I can’t believe the way their customer service was and they were not willing to help at all after leaving a plane full of passengers stranded in California with their only option to book a new flight out of Vegas or Arizona all in their own dime.

### "I will never fly with this airline again!"
The Allegiant employees at the check-in counter at Dulles held me up by forcing me to check my carry-on suitcase. It's the same standard sized suitcase made for overhead bins that I've taken with me on many flights without any prior issues. However it was slightly too thick to fit all the way into a suspiciously skinny test bracket they have fixed to the ground beside the counter, so they forced me to pay extra and check it in. This hassle also delayed me from getting through airport security, but I went along without complaining. After I arrived at the gate, I discovered that the plane had left the terminal about 10 minutes earlier than its scheduled time! Two other passengers missed the flight as well. I called the airline and asked for a refund of the return portion of my itinerary and they refused! And that was after I had been assured by an Allegiant employee at the gate counter that a partial refund would be issued. I will never fly with this airline again! They lie to and rip off customers!

### "no confirmation for my stay"
When I booked my flight I was given the option to add a hotel which I did however when I went to check in at the hotel there was no confirmation for my stay. Allegiant charged me, sent me confirmation but the hotel did not have the confirmation and basically I was left no hotel and had to rebook directly from the hotel. I called Allegiant the day of and was on hold 3.5 hours since this was the day I flying I could not stay on hold. I have emailed them but have not heard back. Their chat is unavailable. My flight was fine and I was able to confirm but if you want a package do not book it with them

### "Absolute horrible experience"
Absolute horrible experience. Flight delayed 6 hours and no update. They gave me a meal voucher worth $10 and a $4 drink. Thanks for the consideration. What about the $300 for missed Airbnb $60 for car rentals? Appreciate the $14 gesture though.

### "I couldn't recommend to anyone"
Worst airline I have ever flown on, chose them due to being the cheapest tickets available, you pay for what you get, before the flight started there were two delays postponing the flight for hours, after takeoff we were informed we would be circling the circling airport due to weather concerns, after circling for 2 hours we were diverted to another airport in a neighboring state, after being told not to worry and leave our bags on the plane because we would be flying back towards the original destination airport by the pilot, we waited for 3 hours to finally be told to come get our luggage, the flight was canceled, and good luck with the remainder of the trip, but this was told to us by the workers at the airport because the allegiant airline workers and pilots had already left and were nowhere to be seen to help the now stranded passengers. Upon calling Allegiant air's customer service via phone we were told not to worry and that the flight would be refunded due to the cancelation, they then informed us that due to our approval to divert the flight to another airport while the flight was going on they would not be refunding any of the cancelation and each member flying would get a 50 dollar credit, this is the kind of bare bones airline I couldn't recommend to anyone and can't still imagine how they are still in business, stay away at all cost/they stranded my family.

### "customer service is 100% awesome"
Not Verified | I just want you to know I have flown with Allegiant for many years and in this December we had a ice storm I had to reschedule and cancel 3 times. This customer service is 100% awesome. I would recommend Allegiant Air to everyone. Customer service is number one and they have it. I'd like to thank everyone at Allegiant for being so accommodating to I will fly again.

### "increasingly disappointed in Allegiant"
Not Verified | I have to say that I am increasingly disappointed in Allegiant Air every time I have an interaction with them. They are cheap, and I will give them that, however on many occasions over the years of flying that I have done with them I realize that they are more trouble than they are worth. They delay the flights often for many hours (this has happened on multiple occasions), charge you for a change in flight date, and charge you if you cancel a flight after 24 hours for a lot of money. Their flight attendants at times are not on time or they are poorly managed. There are many issues that I have personally witnessed and I am unhappy with the service I have received from them.

### "never disappoint at being a disappointment"
Not Verified | Absolute garbage of an airline. Not once have I ever been on a flight with Allegiant that has been departed on time. I learned my lesson a long time ago, but this trip was booked by my parents who swear “it’s not that bad”. Imagine my surprise when we get a text notification as we are walking into the airport that we are looking at a 2.5hr delay. Great news with two senior citizens and two kids under the age of 11 and one toddler. After looking at FlightAware I found that this was a rolling delay that had been hours in the making. This notification could have been sent out hours before just like any other airline notifies their customers. So, now we are sitting at a small regional airport for more than two additional hours with small children with an ETA of 1AM. Ideal situation. Upon arrival we were told that our baggage would delivered to carousel 3 but instead it was a delivered to carousel 6 (in another building). This was only after entire A320 worth of passengers with screaming tired children waited for over an hour. Our return trip was no different. We arrived to Sanford to be treated by a departure board showing 22/32 flights delayed. Three gate changes one plane change after boarding, three hours of waiting we board our “new” plane. Just like any terrible infomercial, “but wait there’s more”! After boarding we waited over an hour for them to load the baggage. I don’t know who thought loading everyone onto a plane with 10 children under the age of two BEFORE the baggage was a good idea after more than a two hour delay, but they need to find a new line of work where common sense and consideration are not necessary. Allegiant, you never disappoint at being a disappointment. I guess someone has to be at the bottom.

### "I will keep flying Allegiant"
Class act from start to finish, very accommodating. The flight was perfect, crew was kind and very helpful. Overall A + service I will keep flying Allegiant.

### "Worst flight experience in my life"
Not Verified |  Worst flight experience in my life. Both my flights on my round trip was delayed by at least 3 hous, my first departure was delayed by 6 hours. Staff was very unhelpful and unsympathetic to any of the problems that occurred, and seemed irritated when all the fault was on them. They loaded a total of 15 bags on my return flight, and sent the rest to God knows where, and sent the flight off anyway. Instead of fixing or helping the whole rest of the customers they seriously inconvenienced, left typed instructions with a pile of papers saying write down your problems and we will deal with them later. Very unprofessional, do not expect any good experiences with this company if you decide to fly with them.

### "We do not recommend"
Not Verified |  Horrible communication. Delayed the flight 4 times without an explanation and then cancelled the flight too late on Christmas Eve to book anything else. They have lost a customer forever. We will never fly with them again. We do not recommend.

### "delayed 6 hrs then they canceled"
Not Verified | It was delayed 6 hrs then they canceled the flight for a fuel problem and there were no other flights to Denver with seats. Would not recommend this airline.

### "Horrible customer service"
I've flown Allegiant multiple times and I'm at my last straw. Horrible customer service and weak flight cancellation excuses are reasons my family will never fly them again. I had a flight cancelled last spring with little notice due to not having enough pilots (they used covid as an excuse but the real reason was there wasn't enough people on the flight). I was forced to rebook thru Delta for $2000 more due to the late timing. Allegiant did nothing to help offset the cost or make it right. Even after waiting on hold to talk to a manager for 2.5 hours. I had another flight scheduled to take off tomorrow 12-24-22 and I received a text this morning saying my flight has been cancelled due to weather. The weather tomorrow is in the 40s and Mesa is in the 60s PLUS the other airlines are still flying. After waiting on hold for 2 hours, there was nothing they could do. I asked to speak to a manager and she said sorry, I would need to call a different number and easier on hold again. Terrible company! Just spend a little more and go with a real airline!

### "too much fuel on the airplane to take off"
Not Verified |  I’m sitting in the airport writing this as it unfolds. They just announced there is too much fuel on the airplane to take off. They are going to remove the fuel and fly to Tulsa and get more fuel but they don’t know if they can find another flight crew to complete the trip to Florida. Just spoke to the pilot who said the previous announcements were false. The pilot said he will fly the leg to Florida but the plane will have to stop for fuel in Tulsa. This is complete mismanagement. Planes have to calculate total weight with fuel and passengers.

### "canceled our flight, no explanation"
We had booked with Allegiant a month and half before Christmas and planned to fly home the week of Christmas for a family reunion. I am military and my family hasn’t all been together in over 5 years. Less than 24 hours before our scheduled flight. Allegiant canceled our flight, no explanation. Looking for next day tickets is a fortune and now we are driving 21 hours to make this family reunion a reality. What was suppose to be a convenient and quick trip has turned into 40+ hour road trip and less time with family over Christmas because now I have to leave a day earlier to accommodate driving. My wife and I are beyond upset, the less than 24 hour notice is mind blowing! How can they do this? And with no explanation?

### "has no ethics or consideration"
Seats available but they split the family, leave the kids by themselves. I need to pray to my kids don't spills soda on the next passenger. It's not because the 50 bucks to change 4 seats. The company has no ethics or consideration for the consumer. Do you think that 50 for 4 seats will change the company's results?

### "absolutely awful at all aspects"
Not Verified | They are absolutely awful at all aspects of a flight experience. Rude people. Unapologetic or sympathetic to being almost an hour delayed. Seem to have never flown in a cold weather city or know it’s cold in winter. You get what you pay for. And I’m this case WAY, WAY, less.

### "not very customer friendly"
Not Verified |  Truly it is not very customer friendly to fly Allegiant. My flight was delayed from 7pm to 12:50pm and there was no sort of refund at all. Also another time they flew above the Provo Utah airport and decided not to land even though they could have (I may add though they were worried about potential ice) and took us straight back to Mesa AZ. They then gave us a flight to Ogden the next day. I believe that there is a much better way to administrate this airline and be more respectful to customers. It is cheap, but it is to the point where it may be more worth it going on American, Delta, or anything else.

### "I can’t believe this airline treats their customers like this"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline. We found out our flight was delayed 9+hours exactly 1.5 hours before take-off. When we went to contact customer service, we were on the phone for 3+ hours and no one responded. They gave me a voucher for this trip since we wound up having to fly on a different more reliable airline. When I went to use the voucher, it wouldn’t work and I contacted customer service with no response for 2+ weeks. I contacted them again and they told me my voucher had been voided. They would not even hear my side of the story and responded with “this is the last time we will reply in regards to this matter.” I can’t believe this airline treats their customers like this. I’m out 200$ now not including the price of the new flight, food, books, etc we had to buy while waiting at the airport.

### "management is terrible, communication is subpar"
Not Verified | The few flights I’ve been on with this airline have been average at best, but this most recent trip was a disaster! Our flight was originally suppose to leave at 4:00 but was delayed due to some reason that was never made clear. After hours of waiting, there was another flight scheduled to leave for this same route at 6:48, but instead of putting us on that plane like they should’ve done since we’d already been waiting for several hours, they let the original passengers take flight, while making us wait for our plane to arrive. Our plane finally arrives and we board the plane around 7:10. After waiting for about an hour to take off, the pilot informs us that the vehicle that was supposed to taxi the plane won’t start and we’ll have to get off the plane until they can “formulate a solution” really? They only have 1 vehicle that can taxi the plane in the whole freaking airport? So that brings us to now, it’s currently about 8:30 and we are all sitting here with no idea what’s going to happen. Allegiants management is terrible, communication is subpar l, and I will drive the 10 hours it takes to get before I fly with this lousy airline again. 0/10 for me.

### "scores minus zero in my book"
Not Verified | I was not able to actually take the trip for the ticket I purchased. According Allegiant's website, changes would be easy to make if necessary and only required a $25 fee. I attempted to make changes on Thanksgiving Day and could not reach them by phone, email, or the chat feature on their website. Hold times were in excess of 3 hours. Understanding this is the case during the holidays, I kept trying to reach them until I finally reached someone 4 days later by setting my alarm to wake me up at 4:00 a.m. so that I could call them. At this point, I was outside of the 7-day window, but tried to explain to the representative that I'd been trying to reach someone well before the 7-day advance notice requirement for changes. The key word here is that I "tried" to explain. The representative I spoke to was the rudest person I think I've ever reached in a customer service department. She kept cutting me off and reciting what sounded like a script that she was reading off of her computer screen. By the time she was finished listing all of the applicable fees, she said my $200 ticket was really only worth $23. I asked to speak to a supervisor and again attempted to explain the extenuating circumstances under which I needed to make a change, but she continued to rudely cut me off mid-sentence. Finally I was so angry I just hung up the phone. The airline needs to anticipate high call volume around holidays and still provide a means of communication with its customers. I was assured by the website that my email would receive a response within 24 to 48 hours, but now almost 2 weeks later I still haven't heard from anyone. They should also train their phone representatives to have some common courtesy and allow customers to speak and not treat everyone as if they're stupid. Let me also add I actually drove 45 minutes to the airport to speak to a representative in person, but there was not one single Allegiant employee at the airport that I could speak to. Overall, this airline scores minus zero in my book!

### "I will never fly this airline again"
My experience flying with Allegiant is my first and last. The ticket agent who checked our bag for the flight down was incredibly rude and tried to bully us into paying 50 for my carry on saying it wouldn’t fit under the seat and threatened it would be 80 at the gate. My bag was smaller than many on the plane. Ended up being fine but she added a lot of stress and irritation to the flight down. Also their bag weight is 10 lbs less than almost every other airline in an effort to squeeze more money out of the passengers who are already flying this airline due to limited funds. On the flight home over thanksgiving weekend we arrived 3 hrs before boarding to reduce stress and ensure no issues getting on the flight. We waited in line for 30 minutes only to be told they would not take our bags until 2 hrs prior to check in. All other airlines are 4 hrs. I was uncomfortable with this and asked about the long line at security as well as boarding being so early and doors being closed 10 minutes before departure on way down. She said you can do priority bag check and the lines at security shouldn’t be that bad. So I am currently stuck outside security with no seats, no food or drinks and stressing out as I watch the security line hoping we can rush through in time to catch our flight. We certainly won’t have any time for dinner before our 8 pm flight so maybe it’s another way to make us spend money on the plane? Not sure but I am certain I will never fly this airline again.

### "I’ll never use this airline again"
Not Verified |  50 degrees and partly cloudy is all it takes to stop a 17 year old minor from flying after being charged 50 bucks for a single carry on that cannot be refunded directly. They can take your payment directly but not issue a refund for a service that was never used. I’ll never use this airline again.

### "This company is really going downhill"
They are seriously going downhill. Bought a ticket for my deaf/disabled son from Flint, MI to Nashville, TN. He had to get a ride to the airport that was over an hour away and was notified that his flight was canceled until after he arrived there. He wasn't given a reason for the cancelation. He tried to communicate with the desk representative and could not understand them. They did not have/were not prepared to deal with a deaf person. My son started to panic and contacted us because he did not know what to do. We had to get him a ride back to Lawrence Technical College and are still trying to figure out how to get him home. I guess the $200 they refunded us is supposed to take care of this mess. I've emailed them and I'm now on hold with them for over an hour. This company is really going downhill. I checked the weather at both airports and it's clear. Haven't been given a reason as to why it was canceled. If they can't provide the service then they shouldn't be selling tickets. And if they are supposed to meet ADA requirements then they should be prepared to have an interpreter on hand to communicate with them. I'll be contacting the ADA to file a complaint.

### "They do not care about customer service"
My husband's flight from Phoenix/Mesa to Idaho Falls was scheduled to leave at 8.30 am. With no explanation, no warning and seemingly no care, it was moved to 2.30 pm. He found out when he was dropped off at the airport. I know you get what you pay for, but even then, Allegiant isn't worth the price. They do not care about customer service or, quite frankly, their customers at all.

### "first impression with a new customer has been an epic failure"
Not Verified |  Allegiant first impression with a new customer has been an epic failure. I get a text message and email my flight was canceled within 2 weeks of my holiday travel. How so unkind of a carrier and service. Never again will I book with this discount airline. I should have stuck with Frontier, way way better discount carrier. As I read other reviews I'm not the only one experiencing such thing, if it keeps up I'm sure this airline won't last long.

### "my seat was changed to 36D"
Not Verified |  I paid an extra $29 so that I could select my seat (6D). Just as I was boarding, my seat was changed to 36D. I was both embarrassed and frustrated as to why this happened. I pay extra for a seat in the front of the plane for a reason. I contacted Allegiant, explained what happened, and expected a refund or credit of $29. Their response was that they would check into it and have heard nothing since.

### "Very disappointed in this airline"
Not Verified |  Traveling home and canceled flights and couldn't rebook for a whole week, had my children with and left us high. Very disappointed in this airline, shame on you for leaving not only me but other customers in a bind and make other arrangements. Had to get a car rental which was way more then my ticket!

### "staff was exceptional"
Allegiant staff was exceptional. They were kind, efficient, and very friendly. Hadn't flown for 25 years and they made it enjoyable. Would fly Allegiant again.

### "messed up our trip plans"
The vehicle the pushes the plain back broke a part. Therefore, due to some paper issue that the Allegiants Air Staff did not have readily available, we were 1 hour 10 minutes late leaving. This long delay was unnecessary and really messed up our trip plans.

### "better than I expected"
I flew from Austin to Orange County CA via Allegiant and had a seamless experience. After reading all the bad reviews, I was nervous, but it turns out, I was one of the lucky ones. My flight had a departure time of 1:50pm and the gate was in the south terminal, away from the main Austin terminal (about a 12 min drive to the other side). My flight started boarding at 1:05. TSA was easy to get through, although they do not have a separate line for TSA Precheck. After walking up the aircraft, I was surprised to see a spacious walking aisle and more legroom than I was expecting. The seats are stiff and do not recline, but you have lots of room for your legs in standard economy. I had a middle seat and was fine. Definitely bring your own entertainment as there is no Wi-Fi or movies available on board. Also, bring snacks and a refillable water bottle filled from the airport. For a $120 last minute ticket, this was better than I expected. We left and landed at the exact time listed. I would recommend.

### "making my flight an enjoyable experience"
Not Verified |  I booked my travel in March, for a trip to Key West. I was meeting my daughter there. I flew Indianapolis to Key West, she flew DCA-EYW. I had not seen her since January. I was so excited about reuniting. We had a wonderful time ! When I booked my reservation, I did not anticipate rotator cuff surgery. I was so concerned about being comfortable. I decided to research Allegiant. I was horrified at the amount of negative reviews. So on my departure I was a bit anxious. But I am here to say I had a wonderful experience. CSA and all the crew were so friendly and very helpful. I did not want to ask for help with my carryon, but the FA literally took my bag and put it in the overhead with a smile on her face. I was so grateful. My return flight went just as smooth. They even drove me to the aircraft to board first. Now everyone complained about the seats. They were not first class comfort, but I had no issues, my flight was 2.5 hrs. Would I want to do this on a flight more than 3 hrs, probably not. But I will definitely book on Allegiant when I meet my daughter again next year. Thank you for making my flight an enjoyable experience. (Even while wearing a sling). Happy flying everyone. I hope your experience goes as smoothly as mine did. (I did not have any delays, or cancellations). Thanks again Allegiant, and I will see you next year.

### "Book with a more reputable airline"
Not Verified |  First off if you choose to fly this airline you better have extra money and a back up plan because when I say they will leave you stranded somewhere and not care less, I mean it. This airline cancelled my flight back from Vegas at 4am without an explanation and zero help to get another flight. Refunded my money and told me to leave. Not their exact words but what happened. Luckily I was able to find a flight later on in the day to a town in my state (not the one I left from). I without a doubt I can say I will never fly this airline again unless they offer flights for about $50 and that's a big maybe. Because that's all this airline is worth $50 a flight (maybe). At the initial start of my journey the Allegiant Airport staff were just rude and condescending to everyone. It was a topic of discussion among passengers once we finally boarded. Enjoyed my trip until it was ready to fly out and my 6am flight was cancelled around 4am without explanation. Only as (former) customers can we stop using these airlines and stop giving them our money. Book with a more reputable airline for a few more bucks get treated better and have a more comfortable and roomier seat. For the extra $100 I should have chosen another airline (the one I flew back on). A lesson I will not forget.

### "I will never fly Allegiant again"
Terrible experience. Even worse customer service. Instead of simply apologizing for the horrible experience we had the email (that took 3 months) said we aren’t required to do this and that. It’s how it goes basically. Delays, a horrible flight attendant nearly knocking us all down during boarding, and then that causing us all to get back off the plane and wait hours. It is a cheap airline and you don’t even get your money worth at that. There was no safety issue. The email response that took months is a joke. I would have much rather had a simple apology. I will never fly Allegiant again. There are other discount airlines or I will pay more and go with an airline who treats their customers and employees well.

### "Not worth your money"
Every single time I’ve flown with Allegiant the flight has been delayed at least an hour. That on top of expensive baggage fees (not letting you bring a carry on) and no in flight food available. The seats are also extremely uncomfortable. Not worth your money. Just buy a ticket that’s originally a bit more expensive because you’ll end up paying even more for Allegiant in both service fees and time.

### "wait in a airport for 4-5 hours"
Not Verified |  Keep the times that you had. Making people wait in a airport for 4-5 hours is not ok. People's time is worth to some people but to Allegiant Air it is not. Do better. This is exactly why everyone chooses anyone else.

### "worst company I've ever dealt with"
Not Verified |  Allegiant Air is the worst company I've ever dealt with in my life. I booked a ticket for myself to Orlando. A week later, my 14 year old daughter wanted to come to visit a friend of hers. I was unable to book her ticket on line because she is a child, and Allegiant won't allow a child to fly alone. I called their customer service and was on hold for four hours and 7 seven minutes after which I just hung up. The next day I went to the airport to speak with an agent in person. When I got there, there was no one there at the counter. Apparently they only show up two hours before a flight. How does one know when they will be there? Good question. Apparently you should check every destination that Allegiant flies to from your airport to see if there is a flight on that day/time so you know when to go there. Brilliant right? Someone at the Delta counter helped me out and told me when the next Allegiant flight would be that day and so I had to come back later. So I come back later that day,and wait on line. I get to the counter and explained my situation. The woman there said only that she couldn't help me and that I had to call customer service. I explained that it's physically impossible to reach a human when calling their customer service. She said she couldn't help me. I mean this very literally when I say that this woman could not have cared less or had any less interest in helping me solve my problem. Hands down the worst customer experience I've ever had with a company.

### "not offer a comparable flight/dates"
I purchased two round trip tickets from Phx/Mesa airport to Belleville, IL airport departing 1/6/2023, returning 1/16/2023 to visit with my family post holidays. Since I knew we would be taking this flight, I purchased a non-refundable hotel ticket since 1/6 flight was early and we live 150+ miles away. I was notified flight was canceled. Early October I tried to call but was on hold for over 30 minutes. I was on the phone 29 minutes - Allegiant advised me they refunded my flight; however, I explained the situation and requested hotel reimbursed. Supervisor refused any other compensation but said she could send me an email explaining the situation. Allegiant Air had my payment for over 2 months and could not offer a comparable flight/dates. Allegiant may have lower flight costs but not worth what I went through and lost $119.27 that will not be recouped.

### "delayed for 4.5 hours"
Flight #2910 from Kentucky to Sanford FL The flight was supposed to leave at 3:45 was delayed for 4.5 hours due to mechanical issues. For the last hour We where told they were waiting on a signature! That is absolutely absurd! They loaded the plane 2/3 thirds full and closed the doors. No one was allowed to get up and walk around for the first two hrs. There were kids on that plane. They didn't give us anything to even drink for hrs. I'm pretty sure the captain and crew weren't happy either. I never like flying and this confirms why.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
This is the worst airline I have ever flown. The staff are not friendly and accommodating. The flights are often times delayed. When we fly out from Vegas to rapid city It was delayed for one hour, and now it’s our return flight to Vegas we just got an announcement that our supposed flight of 6:19 pm to vegas will be delayed to 8:30 pm. What a joke.

### "Absolute JOKE of a company"
Not Verified | Didn't even make it to the flight because their system had an error that made it so our flight leaving was after our flight coming home. Spent $700 on the tickets and was told there is nothing they can do, I have to rebook on my own dime. Absolute JOKE of a company.

### "Poor service all around"
Not Verified |  We were getting ready to leave Vegas when we were starting to take off they stopped on the runway for about 45 minutes. Everyone was getting hot and crabby and some were having a hard time breathing including my sister and I. They finally said that there was an issue with the screen and we will have to go back to the gates. We went back and continued to wait for another hour in an unbelievably hot plane. People were yelling and asking for air because it was so hard to breathe. At this point we were having full blown panic attack and they refused us water until my sister almost passed out and demanded it. This could’ve ended very badly. Such a poor airline and the people working didn’t care. I’m disgusted. If we got off the plane the next flight was 5 days after and we couldn’t have our bags. Poor service all around.

### "customer service is the worst"
Not Verified |  This is not my first encounter with Allegiant keeping my money. Last January 15 2021 flight 998 I came down with Covid and was unable to fly. I contacted Allegiant and held on the phone to talk to an agent for 5 1/2 hours for them to tell me they would not refund me I needed to give them 7 days notice how ridiculous I was sick. They keep $130.00 This year my friend and I planned a trip to Florida Thursday September 29- October 6 well we know what happened next Hurricane Ian. Allegiant notified us on Monday September 26, 9:04 pm our flight was canceled. We understand due to circumstance. I booked the reservation in a credit card that is a closed account. My husband went in and corrected the account number for the refund of $764.00 . Allegiant refund terms indicates it will be refunded with in 72 hours. It is now October 10 and no refund. I am currently waiting on hold to talk to an agent my hold time is 90 minutes? We will no longer flying with Allegiant. Their customer service is the worst, making people wait for hours on the phone. Keeping peoples money is still a crime.

### "Worst customer service experience"
Had a flight out of Peoria to Denver on 10-7 of 2022 at 4:30 p.m. I showed up 2 hours early just like I was supposed to. Sat in the airport until 4:00 p.m. when they boarded us on a plane. Sat on the plane for an hour at the gate until they finally told us that one of the four flight attendants wasn't feeling well and they were going to deport the plane. Went back into the airport and sat for another hour until they finally came across the PA and told us the flight was canceled. Went home and got on the phone with Allegiant Air and sat on hold for another 2 hours until 9:30 p.m. to get my credit back, but when the lady finally got on the phone all she told me is there was an issue with the third party company that gives back the money and I could expect a call back in 6 to 8 weeks. Worst customer service experience of my 53 years. Do NOT book flights with these people. Pay the extra money and stick with American Airlines.

### "never fly with these guys again"
Not Verified |  Great airline if you have no plans and nowhere to be by a certain time! If you do, book 3 days ahead so you can get there by the time you need to be. But otherwise great for if you’re into casually taking a flight for no reason at all, and enjoy spending 7 extra hours in an airport. Complete insanity, will never fly with these guys again.

### "Worst customer service"
Paid extra to sit in front. Really a budget airline but once you start adding the “options” the price can easily reach the price of the major air carriers. Still, they service some markets otherwise not readily available. No Wi-Fi, no entertainment, no food or beverage. Not certain the savings are worth it. Forget about customer service! Several ways to reach out to them on their website but consistently get “chat is unavailable”, “voicemail box is full”, “can’t take your call”, etc! Finally got through on phone and over 2 hr wait! Unbelievable. Maybe they should add $5 per passenger and improve their customer service. Great airline if you know what you’re getting (or not getting) AND everything goes off without a hitch, BUT if you need help, forget about it. Worst customer service I’ve ever experienced with any company.

### "What a racket to take advantage of 80yr man"
Not Verified | Nashville to Pittsburgh. My father booked a flight in May to fly 9/30/22 when he called to do his 24hrs check in system said canceled. He called and was on hold 1hr 45min on 9/29. He is 80yrs old - so he booked another flight triple price - now they say he is double booked and wants to give him a voucher for the first flight. He is 80 he wants his money back for the 2nd triple price flight because of there system. What a racket to take advantage of 80yr man.

### "staff very hard to understand and rude"
Not Verified | Jacksonville to Pittsburgh. I have flown Allegiant Air many times. This is the first time I had to cancel an Itinerary. I paid extra for something called Trip Flex. When I called to cancel I was connected using a terrible VOIP phone system with staff from another country that were very hard to understand and rude. I was told I would receive a credit good for travel until August of 2023 but not even a partial refund. I had included a rental car in my purchase. Not only did I have to pay for the entire flight but also for the rental car. The real surprise was when I was told I would be charged an additional $121.00 to cancel the reservations. This added insult to it all a credit but a fee to get the credit.

### "I can no longer use the promo code"
Booked a flight and used a promo code I found on line. Forgot to use a voucher I had that was about to expire, so I canceled the flight 20 minutes later to rebook the same flight to apply my voucher. The agent told me I can no longer use the promo code since I "already used it". But I didn't use it. Waited on hold for a supervisor to say "sorry that's just the way it works, we can't help you". This flight was being used to help hurricane Ian refugees. That didn't mean anything to them either.

### "4hrs and still on hold"
Not Verified |  4hrs and still on hold. I don't care what's going on, this is completely unacceptable! Every flight I've ever been on with Allegiant has been delayed, postponed, or canceled. Once they even stranded my wife and I in Minneapolis by canceling the flight and using the planes to go to Allegiant field after a football game. Just left us there! Even if if costs more, use a different airline.

### "Allegiant Air has the worst seats"
This is the first time flying Allegiant Air for me. After this round trip I can safely say I will never be flying Allegiant again. I can not and will never recommend Allegiant Air. Both my flights were delayed. My flight to Las Vegas was delayed by almost 2 hours. Completely ruining my plans for Thursday night. Then when leaving Las Vegas on Sunday my flight was delayed again by more then an hour. And now they need to do maintenance on the plane. I'm currently writing this stuck on the plane while they're doing maintenance. Why have everyone board the plane then do maintenance. Absolutely terrible planning. Plane was supposed to be leaving at 6.00pm. It's currently after 8.00pm and we're all still sitting on the plane with no estimated take off time. These seats are the most uncomfortable seats I've ever sat in. A concrete park bench is more comfortable. I've flown with other airlines and so far Allegiant Air has the worst seats. United seats are like recliners in comparison. Worst experience of my life and I've had a colonoscopy. Just pay the few extra dollars and fly with any other airline.

### "unprofessional and unsettling"
Not Verified |  Our flight was cancelled, which is totally fine—that happens! However, how they handled it was terrible for the following reasons: The gate workers were blatantly laughing about the situation in front of us. Extremely unprofessional and unsettling. When I asked questions to the gate workers, they gave sassy answers and were, in my opinion, disrespectful. They were untruthful several times. The most flagrant was when the flight was cancelled at around 10pm they said we would receive an email in the morning about when the flight would leave. We had no idea what time the flight was leaving until we looked it up for ourselves in the app. I woke up at 4am waiting for the email but it never came. 4) They lowered our compensation for no reason. Allegiant was generous and gifted each traveler a certain amount of money for future flights. Then as soon as we left, Allegiant lowered the money we received by $50 and did not provide a reason for why. Ridiculous. Flight details: Provo to Mesa original depart time: 8:14pm original depart date: September 22, 2022 The complaints only apply to the gate workers on 9/22, but the gate workers the next day were fantastic

### "great experience"
Great airline. Polite staff, comfortable flight, great experience. Allegiant was great especially for a budget airline! Food was decent but definitely average airplane food. 10/10 would fly again.

### "the most horrible experience"
Not Verified |  It was the most horrible experience of my life. I am a retired Hispanic female. When I arrived to the Allegiant counter, I opened my app and had a notification that I was unable to check in through the app. I showed the notification to the female at the counter. The "supervisor" behind her informed me I had to go to the website and try again. Did I mention I'm retired. My tech skills are lacking. When I asked the supervisor if she could help me she said loudly "your bag looks too large and if it doesn't fit in that box I need 50 dollars! I was traveling with my daughter who paid for a checked bag and a carry on. She only had a checked bag so we were good so I thought. With a large line behind me the two customer service females offered little to no assistance. I could have just fallen to the floor crying. I felt humiliated and ashamed for my poor tech skills. I thought about it all night. They were bullies. When my daughter and I arrived to the gate it was as if the females notified the female at the gate because I was targeted once again. She interrogated my daughter about my carry on. I feel like I'll never get over this. It was the most horrible experience of my life.

### "staff was extremely rude to me"
Not Verified | Pasco to Los Angeles. On 07/24 I had a flight from Pasco to Los Angeles at 2:48 pm. At 1:15 I started the check-in online, tried to pay my luggage $21, twice and it showed a sign that said "Unable to complete advanced Check-in" Please see an allegiant airport check-in agent for assistance. I have the screenshot of it on my phone. I get to the airport at 1:30 and there is a huge line to do the check-in. By the time it's my turn, the girl at the counter wants to charge me $50 for my luggage and $5 for printing my ticket. I explained to her that I tried to print it and pay for my luggage and it told me to come to the counter. She said I needed to do it 1 hour before the flight, I show her the screenshot that I tried to do more than 1 hour before and that is not my fault that by the time I get here you have 50 minutes of waiting in line to get to the counter. She said right now she couldn't do anything. The staff was extremely rude to me and told me that I was wasting her time, that she needed to continue with the next customer, and started calling the next person while I wasn't even checked in. She said if I want to complain, call this phone number, 702 505 8888. She said "you either leave the luggage here or you pay". I paid out of desperation to get on that plane. I called that number 4 times, more than 2 hours of waiting time. When I finally can talk with someone, after waiting in line for 90 minutes, the person told me there is nothing they can do once I paid for my luggage at the counter, next time call them and they will add the luggage to my card if I'm having trouble. How do they expect me to communicate with you if you have 2 hours of waiting time during peak hours when my flight is leaving in less than 1? Nothing makes any sense. How am I supposed to be in the counter more than 1 hour before the flight if you have more than 1 hour of line? How am I supposed to call and ask for help if you have 2 hours of waiting time on the phone line? This is beyond ridiculous. I know I took a low-budget airline and for that, I had to pay for my luggage, I'm not trying to pay, I just want to have the extra money that I paid back. I put my card twice to pay for $21 dollar luggage, and they charged me $50. I tried to print/download my boarding pass, they charged me $5. I would like to have a refund of my $34. Since I haven't received an answer for more than 6 weeks, I contacted them by chat and they kept sending me their policy of non-refundable page, and get me disconnected twice.

### "never be flying with this airline again"
I had a flight 3 months ago GR MI to Nashville TN. they delayed the flight a lot during the day and kept doing so until about 11pm and as everyone is commenting over the intercom that we are going to Nashville over and over again -  they so casually cancel it. So unprofessional, so careless, and disrespectful. Just cancel it after the delays hours before because you obviously knew you weren't going to do the flight. Things were promised after, 72 hours after,  but to no ones surprise things haven't happened the way promised. 200 dollar vouchers promised per flight, I had 2 under my card info and I have reach out countless of times through phone, email, chat and course no answers. I received one over a month after ... and still waiting on the other 200 dollar voucher. I had to travel to Nashville regardless for work related things and so my friends and I rented a car, thinking great the money to help will be there but no. They have 0 concern. I will never be flying with this airline again. who cares if its cheap .. later on ends up costing you more anyways and also they just are a joke.

### "The woman became very rude"
When they just boarded, they left her squished with both boys, & her service dog in row 18, instead of moving her like like she was told. She's a Bernese mountain dog who is 125lbs that they have smooshed in there. The woman at the ticket counter was beyond rude to all of us regarding my sister's service dog. She flipped out, because supposedly they didn't get some email from her "48hrs prior to boarding. Although they could see everything in the computer, minus this 1 form that she obviously knows to carry with her anyways. The woman rudely asked her, well did you send in everything like it asks? Email, & all? She said yes. The woman became very rude, & said she had to call customer service to help her, & to step aside so she could help others until she got in touch with them. Mind you this whole time it's making the line stare at us, as she shuffled us from counter to counter. Then she asked for  papers as she has to send a copy to someone. While waiting for the papers she asked her why she had the service dog. What tasks she needs R for. She explained stage 4 breast cancer, she helps me with x,y, and z. She looked at her funny, so she repeated it to her, & it wasn't because she didn't hear her. She legit looked at her, with this look of disbelief, & she repeated as this lady just stared at her. She then proceeded to tell the other person on the phone well the dog is huge, & she's just laying on the ground. Then she says to the woman on the phone, well all of her paperwork is in a plastic sleeve, I don't know why it's like that. She's just shredding her about how she needs to be at Portland airport 48 hrs in advance to register R, for the trip back in 8 days, & the email she just sent went through without issues, so she didn't know why we had issues. Oh, & she couldn't do it while she is there when she gets off the plane. I said well if it's only an email she needs to be sent 48hrs in advance, can we have the email that you just used so it will be easier on her? She said no. She had to go to the airport in person 48hrs prior, or R could be denied! I said why can't she have an Allegiant email that works to be sure the paperwork is sent in? I explained that she's literally 1 hour 1 WAY to the airport. I explained that she physically cannot do that (as this was already very clearly insanely overwhelming), especially if all they need is an email. She then says ma'am are you flying today? I said no, I'm her sister, as well as one of her caregivers, & I really want to know why you're making her jump through extra hoops, when you just said it just needs an email. Well she put in the memo/notes of her return flight that's already booked through them that she HAS to come in person 48 hrs in advance, or the dog will be denied. She then said to me, well if you're not flying I've got a whole other line of people to help, & so have a good day. Oh yeah, & to top it off, their bag was between 41lbs, & 42lbs, & she made her take out 2lbs. Another person weighed his, it was over, and that was ok though.

### "overall a great experience"
From the check in counter to the flight attendants the customer service was great! The woman at check in (sorry I didn't get her name) was wonderful, knowledgeable and kind! The seating was a bit tight, but overall a great experience!

### "business travel with this airline is risky at best"
This particular flight was delayed for over 3 hours and when the plane finally arrived and the passengers unloaded - only then did they tell us our flight was cancelled - they did send a 200.00 apology but that does not do much when your family is waiting and days of plans need to be cancelled/rescheduled. The telephone agent that I waited 45 minutes for after the cancellation because I had a rental car and could not do that online, was rude- very rude! I understand she was probably having a rough day dealing with upset people but I had a rough day too and was not rude to her. I have had so may bad experiences with them lately and I have multiple friends/family that have experienced the same it is just a shame. This used to be a decent way to travel with direct flights and lower cost but the underlying 'costs' are just too much. Any business travel with this airline is risky at best.

### "Do not book their bundle"
Not Verified |  Flight got cancelled a month in advance, no problem, call customer service, very sweet rep helped me greatly getting me a new booking and no additional costs. Just called again, hour and a half hold time, needing to adjust my car rental included in my bundle, rudest rep ever. I had to wait an hour for someone to be stuck up with me. I could barely hear her first off, she would randomly place me on hold as i had the speaker to my ear to understand her, so that was so kind of her to allow the hold music to blare into my ear with no warning. I had a question about costs on the rental with the bundle and what exactly im “saving”, instead she mouthed off “IF YOU READ THE EMAIL IN THE RED, IT TELLS YOU THE TOTAL COST ISNT INCLUDED, FEES ARE PAID AT THE RENTAL COMPANY”. I understand, i was needing a breakdown of why its still $550 plus $200 in fees at the rental company. When if i just book through the company it would be $530 altogether. Do not book their bundle, you aren't saving anything. You’re just going to get stuck with a rude representative telling you your dumb for not reading the red. When i did. I wasn’t hostile towards her, i understand the rude people these reps get over the phone, but there was absolutely no reason for her to have this tone with me and treat me as if i were stupid.

### "how unreasonably rude this woman was"
Not Verified |  For some reason one of the Allegiant employees was going around the waiting area demanding to see everyone’s boarding passes then very rudely demanding to see how much baggage they were carrying on to the plane. I understand there are limitations in place and specific allowances for baggage so that was not the issue here. The issue was how unreasonably rude this woman was. When confronted by her I showed her that our family of four had the approved amount of luggage and that the extra piece was a medical device thus not part of baggage allowance. She was extremely rude about it. There was no reason to be as we were complying with her requests. She moved on and continued to be rude to the other waiting passengers. I mean you don’t expect much from a low budget airline like this but basic respect and courtesy.

### "Worst flight experience ever"
Not Verified |  Worst flight experience ever. Plane sat on the tarmac for almost an hour longer than it should because the stewardess felt the need to go down every single row and confirm that each passenger was in their assigned seats for a flight that wasn’t even fully booked. Empty window seat next to you? Too bad, you must sit in your assigned seat anyway. Then they did a front to back passenger head count, only they spent so long checking the seats that multiple passengers had gone to the bathroom. So they had to start over every time someone left. Even the pilot asked over the intercom if we were cleared to leave yet. Absolute disaster. No airline I have ever flown has obsessed over passenger head counts and assigned seats to the point that they delayed their own departure flight. The flight attendants either have a power complex or there is needlessly strict policy tried to their take off.

### "very bad customer service"
Very bad service, very bad customer service. Rude staff that will not assist you if you need help (Des Moines Iowa Airport). It is not just once but every time we have used Allegiant Air. I don't understand how you loose a luggage on a direct flight. Delayed flights, every time. Disappointment.

### "overcharging for check-in bag"
I have never been treated so horribly in my life. Two of the tickets and check-in crew were rude and disrespectful. The manager and staff at terminal 1 of the Las Vegas airport were mean, rude and disrespectful to me. I wonder how they sleep at night knowing how horribly they treat her passengers in addition to overcharging for check-in bag.

### "a rude tone and ending downright nasty"
Not Verified |  Rude employees. Was told one thing in Florida, but the opposite happened once we landed in New York. How dare I question an employee where my bags were?! This individual interrupted me 3 times, never actually listened to my question. She just kept repeating herself, starting with a rude tone and ending downright nasty. It's an economy airline, and I've flown many times. I can deal with the tiny, cramped seats; the high cost of any in-flight food or beverage - including water! ; the complete lack of onboard entertainment or Wi-Fi. The absolute least I expect from this airline is respectful employees, and they did not deliver.

### "by far the worst flight experience"
This has been by far the worst flight experience I’ve ever had. I’ve flown with Spirit, American Airlines, & Delta throughout my life with little-no issues. My friends and I ended up waiting at the airport for 7 hours with no updated information on our flight. My friends and I were patiently waiting for absolutely nothing. This airline was only able to offer free water and pop for our troubles. Allegiant also offered cheaper vouchers to be used for the future, which is of absolutely no value to any of us since we’ll never use this company again. Despite this terrible event, we decided to attempt again in the morning as directed by the email. The flight was supposed to leave at 11 am and here my friends and I sit at the airport again with a possible time to leave at 12:30 pm when the plane was supposed to depart at 11 am. This situation is extremely unprofessional and does not know what is going on, what to do, or how to keep their word. I am baffled about the circumstances. 0/10 would recommend.

### "lowest rating seems overly optimistic"
Our original flight left 30 minutes early with no prior notice. Normally I would see this as a positive, except for the fact that I wasn’t on the plane. And they told me there was no way to rebook and there were no flights going into the area for another four days. Then I overheard someone getting on a flight to a very nearby city. I asked to get on that flight and thankfully got transferred after a long back-and-forth. That flight was then on track to leave 20 minutes early as well! However, the flight was eventually delayed after they realized they had put on 9000 pounds too much fuel. Then the computer crashed and we had to go back to the gate to get a paper copy of the release to fly with the extra weight. We are currently sitting on the tarmac. At this point we would probably be just as well off if we taxi down the expressway to our destination. The fact that I am limited to one star as a lowest rating seems overly optimistic on their part. What is less than one star?

### "The worst airline in my opinion"
The worst airline in my opinion. Customer service is horrible from lower level to upper management. They will delay your flight and won’t do anything for you. Avoid them at all cost.

### "incredibly rude to their passengers"
Not Verified |  The Allegiant crew in Asheville that were loading passengers onto the plane were incredibly rude to their passengers. Our flight was delayed 2 hours and passengers were getting no reasoning on why it was delayed or what was happening. Many passengers went up to the Allegiant workers to get clarification on what was happening, and their responses were sickening. These female Allegiant workers were yelling at multiple passengers for asking simple questions. It was evident that the majority of passengers were confused and maybe addressing the situation could have been more efficient, rather than yelling in individuals' faces. These female workers represent the company a as a whole, and respecting passengers should be the number one priority. Watching these encounters first-hand made me realize the disrespect and rudeness that was created from the Allegiant workers. I am incredibly disgusted in this behavior and it has made me think differently about the airline as a whole. Yelling at passengers because they were expressing their confusion is completely uncalled for. Allegiant needs to realize how to treat their passengers, and once they do I will think about flying on this airline again.

### "Seats weren’t comfortable"
Not Verified | Belleville to Destin. Awful. 0/10. Canceled two flights for some ungodly known reason. Never again. Seats weren’t comfortable. Computer rest was broken. A/C for my row didn’t work. Worst flight experience i’ve ever had.

### "zero value for your money"
Planes are barely functional. Deplaning now after 4 hours in plane. Their computers are not working. They don’t have a clue as to when we might be able to leave. It’s 9 am been here since 4 am to catch their horrible flight time of 6 am. Never again. You get zero value for your money.

### "won't let you check in until 2 hours before your flight"
This was my second time flying Allegiant. We left early to get there and get through security quickly and relax. Unfortunately Allegiant won't let you check in until exactly 2 hours before your flight. There was no self service kiosk either. The app is also hourly. So since were there more than 3 hours before the flight we were told to take a seat until 3.15. We do such and as we get closer people wait in line while most of us are seated. Before you know it the line is 40 prior deep as a group of college age kids let all their friends cut in line. I get to the counter visibly upset and she can see that. I say that I'll just keep my mouth shut and from point on I'm talked down to. Get there early is simply a waste of your time and to not Pittsburgh security is insane. I've been to bigger airports and somehow Pittsburgh TSA just can't seen to get it right. TSA are rude and just clueless half the time.

### "an excellent trip both ways"
Not Verified | Bellingham to Las Vegas. Had an excellent trip both ways! Flight was even early and very smooth! Will definitely fly with Allegiant again! No problems very friendly. Booked package w hotel was excellent

### "Would not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Would not recommend this airline, as they are more worried about selling snacks than they are about kindness or human dignity. Flew in July 2022. We sat on the plane for 40 minutes before taking off. As soon as they starting selling drinks I tried to use the restroom (I was recently treated for cancer, had a transplant, and was on extensive medicine that often caused stomach problems). There were carts at both ends of the aisle, but neither cart was more than 2 rows into service. None of the 4 attendants were willing to let me through, even when I expressed that I could not wait. When I asked if they could just back up a few feet I was told “the cart is too heavy to lift”. I had to return to my seat and wait until they passed before rushing to the bathroom. Only when I emerged crying did one attendant show any kind of pity and offer me a glass of ice. They never apologized in any way and in fact avoided making eye contact with me for the rest of the flight and while deplaning. In short, it was more important for them not to be inconvenienced by 6 feet that it was to show kindness.

### "seek alternate transportation"
Not Verified |  I reluctantly booked a flight from Asheville North Carolina back to Melbourne Florida in spite of all of the negative reviews about this airline, A few days before our flight tried to contact Allegiant customer service as many times as you can imagine even up to 2 o'clock in the morning and nobody answers! Got on their website and left them a request to contact me regarding a change in flight schedule. Other than an automated email response never received any communication from allegiant air. We stopped by the ticket counter in Asheville North Carolina and was met by two ticket agents one on both sides of the counter staring into their computers and waited in line was absolutely nobody else in the terminal without being recognized or spoken to. I finally said hi and asked who would can help me please? Neither Agent spoke or motion for me to come forward they just stared at me with literally angry faces. I walked up to the female agent and said hello and related my story of needing to change our schedule flight. The male Angry agent said in a very stern manner we cannot change your itinerary you must call customer service! Related the fact that I've been trying to get through to Customer service many many times by phone and email and had no response so we decided to drive out of our way and hopefully get assistance at the ticket counter. The female agent explained in the most unfriendly manner That she couldn't help me just call Customer service. I replied if I can't get through to customer service can't you help me at all with the change of schedules and the mail customer service agent said once again we can't change your itinerary in an angry manner at which point we exchanged a few final words and he blurted out that they do not work for Allegiant Air they are just contractors working as ticket agents for Allegiant! Either way they didn't change our schedule and we were out $800 for our flight. We did not choose Allegiant to save money although it was the only convenient way to airline to Melbourne Florida. My strong advice is to seek alternate transportation elsewhere because if this is the way customer service is conducted at allegiant airways you're sincerely making a mistake.

### "I was chased down and told to return for my checked bag"
Due to my wife’s flight on another flight with Delta and the fact that we had to return our car rental earlier in the day, I arrived at BNA airport 4 hours and 15 minutes early for my flight. I checked in online and stood in line to check my bag. I completed the check in process/checked bag and as I was walking towards security, I was chased down and told to return for my checked bag because I was too early. I was told to return to check my bag in 2 hours and 15 minutes, so now I am sitting on a bench in the baggage claim. Every other airline that I have flown with has allowed me to check in early, but not Allegiant. Now I am unable to walk my wife to her gate and shop the airport as I had planned. Absolutely ridiculous.

### "Fly another carrier"
Not Verified |  Worst Airline for online booking, for hidden fees, for website ease of use, for customer service, and for customer assistance. A flight to FL which looks like on line it would be under $150 was $400 after all the fees they charge, on top of the fees they charge. This airline is not an economic good choice. Everything is extra, even if you don't want to pay for seat selection, you pay for seat selection. You walk across the tarmac to deplane and board in FL, there is no water on flight unless you pay for it. Changing flights is a nightmare. No credit was issued when I changed a flight and I was charged more for a flight that cost less. I waited on line for 4 hours to talk to someone profoundly disinterested in customer service. The plane was comfortable and it was an easy board. I don't think that is worth the agony and time spent trying to get the reservation and then get a credit for a cancelled flight, another rip off. Fly another carrier, it will be cheaper and easier.

### "worst customer service"
Las Vegas to Austin. In the hundreds of flights I’ve taken during my lifetime, this was the worst experience I’ve ever had with any airline. This returning flight home was delayed 24 hours for “maintenance issues”. Never have I been on a plane that has been delayed that long for any reason, weather or otherwise. The Allegiant staff at the Las Vegas airport are truly doing the bare minimum with no regard for your schedule and had no urgency to try and get us on another flight. Their voucher won’t even cover a hotel room for tonight - not to mention the extra day of work myself and my friends are now having to forego because of this. Truly ridiculous. Going on hour 12 of being stuck at the Vegas airport. Truly the worst airline, worst customer service, and worst flying experience you will ever go through if you choose Allegiant.

### "more concerned about the money to be made"
I have flown with Allegiant several times in the past and typically have no issues with them. However, when it comes to making flight adjustments, if I could give them less than 1 star, I would. The first time I needed to make an adjustment back in 2020, my fiancé was having major back surgery that got moved up at the last minute. For that reason, I needed to cancel my flight and drive up a couple of days early to make it in time for the surgery. I bought the trip protection, and they informed me that my situation did not "qualify" for the refund. Never saw a cent of my "protected" flight. More recently, we had a flight scheduled but had a last minute COVID-19 exposure (my roommate tested positive for COVID the day of the flight). When I contacted support, they proceeded to tell me to show up for my flight as scheduled and that if I was not positive, they did not care who I had come into contact with (more specifically, that "we come into contact with asymptomatic covid positive people everyday"). I made the conscious decision to miss the flight (without any form of refund), because I could not knowingly put other people in harms way. Ultimately, this came across to me as being more concerned about the money to be made, than the other passengers well being. Respect was lost after this experience.

### "Rude flight attendants"
Rude flight attendants. I did not want to place my personal bag on the floor under the seat. Had my son place in overhead bin. Flight attendants said I could not. I explained and showed them the food crumbs and debris On the floor. They were nasty to me telling me the floor was clean. Threatening to Have a rep come on board to talk to me and basically escort me off. So they let me leave it in the overhead but came back 5 minutes later to poke me again about it. Totally made a scene. Bottom line if the floor was clean as it should, we would never of had the conversation. But you get what you pay for. Discount airline, discount customer service.

### "Allegiant is the absolute worst airline in the industry"
Just my 2 cents! I wish I could give less than 1 star review. We are a stranded family of 5 from Greensboro, NC. Our Flight was delayed for 2 hours and then flight was canceled, no explanation! Their Business model is completely dysfunctional, it doesn’t provide passengers with any options and or any way to get home. An 1.5 hour canceled flight cost my family an extra $1,000 dollars on a rental car, a hotel room and a day wasted driving to NC. Thanks for the headaches! Allegiant is the absolute worst airline in the industry. I’ll go through life telling everyone I meet the same thing!

### "customer service also gets a zero"
Worst experience ever! I will never fly with Allegiant again! The flight to and from Florida totally disappointed. On our flight down we were delayed 3 hours. The airplane breaks caught on fire when we landed. The flight home was delayed 4 hours and at 10.00 pm it was canceled. We were stranded in Punta Gorda! The Airline announce it canceled the flight and basically you’re on your own on. We were stuck trying to figure out how to get home, we had to catch an Uber and take it to Tampa’s airport. Cost 500.00 dollars. There were 5 of us. Luckily we found a flight with Frontier Airlines. Their customer service also gets a zero. It’s better to pay the extra money with a decent airline.

### "cancelation right at boarding time"
This is unacceptable. The cancelation right at boarding time, the fact I'm still on hold with customer service after 2 hours and 21 minutes. Just how bad is this company messing up to have that long of a hold time? $200? And when will we actually get that? Not in time. How is that going to pay for lodging and a ticket the next day? I needed that flight to leave asap. Time is of the essence. Allegiant doesn't fly out on Fridays from BNA. The next earliest flight is $400. My family and I have spent thousands of dollars with you guys. Never again. Shame on this company.

### "do not use a budget friendly airline"
I live in central KY and planned a cruise leaving from Miami so I decided to use Allegiant Air to get me there. Within 40 minutes of departure on a Friday evening, they cancelled the flight! I had a room booked in Miami for that evening, so i lost that money. But the cost of finding a new flight was where the losses really began to incur. I spoke with a customer service rep who hung up on me after telling me the flight was only delayed, not cancelled. i called him back twice and he offered no help, only insisted the flight was delayed. The cost of booking 2 tickets last minute with another airline to get me to Miami was nearly $2000. I had no choice! Allegiant did refund my tickets, just under $500 and gave me an additional $200, but that does not even touch how expensive the other plane tickets were. I suggest do not use a 'budget friendly' airline, the chaos at the airport is not worth it. They did not allow me to check in when i arrived at the airport upon my return, they actually moved me out of line twice. Once checked in, the flight was delayed twice and I missed my ride at my home airport by 45 minutes.

### "Allegiant Air was an absolutely horrible experience"
Not Verified |  As usual Allegiant Air was an absolutely horrible experience. The service is not too great, as much as my flights do usually take off on time you are almost guaranteed to wait over an hour after landing, because there is no available gate. They also really love to keep telling us the wait will be 10-15 minutes, when in reality I know it will be 60+ minutes. The only reason I actually keep flying with this terrible airline is because the tickets are dirt cheap and it is one of the only airlines that has the flight I need.

### "they cancel my flight to Florida without explanation"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline, I arrive to the airport and they cancel my flight to Florida without explanation not for one or two hours but for a whole day, I have to wait until next day to fly back home. I have to work and of course they don’t care. They do not refund your money, do not offer hotels or any help to pay for another day. I am losing a day at work due to the flight cancellation. Do not fly Allegiant, they are the worst airline.

### "This was the most awful experience"
This was the most awful experience I've ever had through an airline. I will never fly with Allegiant. They initially delayed our flight from 7:21 to 9:35. As soon as the incoming flight got off the plane, they canceled our flight to Nashville, without a reason. This was on a Thursday, I was going to a concert with my daughter on Friday and we were coming back on Sunday. Of course, there was no option to get on another flight bc they didn't fly again till Sunday. We missed our concert, I still had to pay for our tickets and our Airbnb. I'm still waiting for the money back for our flight.

### "I’ll never fly with Allegiant"
Newark to Knoxville. I've flown on 150+ international and domestic flights in my life, and this has never happened to me before. This is my second time flying with Allegiant and my 9:55am flight initially got delayed by 1h20min. Come time to board, they’ve just deplaned the previous flight and five minutes later, announced that there’s a mechanical issue so the flight got delayed from 11:20 to 2:40p. Around 1:30, they delay to 7:45, saying it could be as late as 9 that we board, with the potential for the flight to get cancelled as a whole. Now, it’s 10:05pm. No other communication and they keep pushing it back. We’re forced to wait here for total uncertainty. They won’t give us our money back unless they cancel the flight. All they gave us was an $8 meal voucher for a 13 hour delay - and the voucher doesn’t provide change. Use it on a $3 cup of coffee and it’s gone. People are unsure of whether to go home, stay at the airport, and even whether the flight is safe since this is a mechanical issue. They’ve told us absolutely nothing. No flights tomorrow for the same route. This is the worst flight experience I’ve ever had, and I’ll never fly with Allegiant Air again.

### "they kept delaying planes for 3 hours"
Not Verified |  The one trip we booked with them they kept delaying planes for 3 hours. This is completely ridiculous. I glad our plans didn't include something at our destination within that 3 hour time frame. I would rather pay exorbitant airfares on other airlines than to deal with this ever again. At least they didn't make us pay for the check in like they did coming out. They don't even give you complimentary water on a four hour flight. Nope you get to pay $3 per bottle just like if I bought it at the airport.

### "They were impatient and no help at all"
The worst airline to book, had a flight for today booked, I just added on a child on the phone and it turns out the lady changed the whole date of the flight without me knowing and nobody on the crew wanted to help me, they gave me their worst attitudes even though we were polite and tried to explain our situation. They were impatient and no help at all, they kept questioning our decisions and kept giving their personal views on it. I had proof that their side was wrong and I had emails stating that I was on this flight, and forwarded the email as they wanted to 10 times and it kept saying sent and they claimed that they never received it and didn't want to do anything, and I called directly to Allegiant when I made the child change no other 3rd party. I called customer service and 5 hours later and nothing, haven't talked to no one, and we don't know what to do.

### "worst customer service experience ever"
I had the worst customer service experience ever with with Allegiant Air. My partner and I tried to change flights due to a last minute emergency. We tried calling an agent who would not help or move our flights and honor our previous purchase. They were rude and could not explain what they were trying to do and just pushed us to customer service. The hold time to talk to anyone was 2+ hours. We called off a different phone and asked to speak to a supervisor or manager so we could just move our flights. We were not asking for refunds, or even any money back and we're willing to pay a difference due to how last minute it was. They didn't want to accommodate us, and were asking for us to basically book a whole new trip. No matter who I spoke to (all of which were outsourced agents and no one from the States) no one would help us out. We were forced to eat one passenger, and the other had to travel alone to not loose money. I will never fly Allegiant again, and would rather travel out of my way to another airport to fly with another airline.

### "delayed our flight for 5 hours"
Not Verified |  This company delayed our flight for 5 hours. Then they rescheduled our flight to the next day at 8:00 p.m. approximately 24 hours later. We were stranded in El Paso Texas for the evening. We had to purchase a flight with another airline company Southwest Airlines. We also have to purchase a hotel for the evening so we had a place to sleep. The next day we were getting more alerts saying that the next flight was being delayed further after we had even already canceled. On top of that before we keep it took this flight delayed our flight from 3:30 p.m. originally til10:40 p.m. this flight was supposed to fly July 10 2022. They do not have a sister company that they can switch you to. They will not offer you any emergency hotel stay. Be sure to have extra money for a back up plan or it can get ugly.

### "worst flight i have ever been on"
This flight was the absolute worst flight i have ever been on. We fly allegiant regularly to Florida. This flight started out being delayed an hour and 19 minutes for boarding due to the pilots running out of flying hours and having to wait on new ones. After boarding it was almost another 30 mins before leaving. When we finally reached our destination we hovered for about 20-25 mins due to a storm. Finally it was decided to detour to Nashville 2 hours away from the original destination due to needing fuel. After landing for fuel and sitting on the Tarmac for almost 2 hrs we were told we would not be going to original destination and would either be staying in Nashville or going back to Florida. If anyone were to stay on the plane all checked luggage would go back to Florida as well. I was traveling with a 3 year old and a 7 year old with checked car seats. So I was forced to make sure everyone was getting off and checked bags would be staying in order to decide due to needing my car seats. There was absolutely no communication with this flight as to what was really going on and a 2 hour flight turned into a 5 hour ordeal and being left in a city 2 hours from where i was suppose to be. There was no compensation offered nor food or anything for that matter. It was after midnight when we finally got off this plane after being on it since 8ish and never even arrived at our destination. I am unsure that i will even use this airline again after the way this situation was handled because it was completely ridiculous.

### "there is no solution to my problem"
Not Verified |  My flight was fine until they lost my 8 month old car seat. I gate checked my stroller and car seat at the gate and when I landed in Bishop airport they only had my stroller. How am I suppose to travel with a newborn baby without a car seat. I landed at 1.46 pm June 11th, I wasn't able to leave until 4pm. I was extremely tired and had no choice but to leave and hope I didn’t crash or get pull over with my child. I’ve contacted customer service, no luck with the phone number always busy. I’ve call Bishop and I was told it’s nothing they can do. I can’t afford another car seat. This is horrible and they have no regards for the safety of my child this is the worst thing I’ve had to deal with and it seems as there is no solution to my problem, I would not recommend this flight they don’t take care of your property.

### "impolite and unprofessional behavior"
The worst service I have ever received from an airline. They even did not give me a receipt for charging my luggage! I emailed them asking for receipts! The answer was that it would take 4-6 weeks! Very impolite and unprofessional behavior from Allegiant airline staff at the airport. I will never try that airline.

### "I wouldn’t recommend this company"
Absolutely the worst airline we have ever flown with and the customer service is just as bad. We chose this company because they 'honor veterans and military'. After booking our flight in May to fly from GSO to PIE June 24th to return July 1, we realized military veterans and traveling family were 'supposed' to get free checked bags, we had 3. We emailed customer service with documentation twice. After a couple of weeks and no response my husband called the customer service, after holding almost 2 hours he was told we needed to show the military ID at the airport for verification and call back after our flight for a refund. June 24 rolls around, we get to the airport for almost 2 hours, they won’t take bags and we wait to hear if our flight is cancelled. Finally they allow us to check in at the desk and take our bags. As instructed my husband provided his veterans ID and the lady said we were all set. After several more delays we finally made it to PIE. July 1, our day to fly home we get a text message a couple of hours before our flight that it had been cancelled with no reason or rescheduling, we would receive a refund in 72 hours. There was not another flight out until July 4 so we were forced to drive 10 hours home. This morning 7/7 my husband called because we had not received any notice showing our refund and it wasn’t showing pending on our account and all record of the flight was removed from our app and online. After holding forever he spoke with a staff member who told him that the check in terminal did not do what they were supposed to in order to refund our baggage for military so we would not get a refund for the baggage on the flight there. She did after an extended hold, process the refund for our return cancelled flight. When asked why it wasn’t automatically refunded as our message said, she said the systems do not always process the refund. So if he didn’t call we would have never been refunded. This was our first experience flying with them and I wouldn’t recommend this company.

### "Worst airline I ever flew"
Cheapest airlines. If you don't checkin online, charge you $15 for boarding pass. My friend had a small drone case along with personal item. She had a checkin but didn't choose as all she had was a personal bag and a drone case. They initially asked to pay $50 for extra bag. Once she explained that she had checkin and didn't choose it, coz of the size. They still charged $15. I guess that's how they operate cheap flights=. Even the water is not free, you need to pay for it. Worst airline I ever flew.

### "Got delayed 4 times then canceled"
Not Verified |  Got delayed 4 times then canceled, vouchers for hotel that wasn't open that night, held hostage at airport in Vegas to be told a new flight at 7 in morning, then canceled for half the people that time, no hotel, miscommunication on all fronts, never recommend.

### "Allegiant Air is the worst"
Allegiant Air is the worst! They change or delay every flight. They moved our late morning honeymoon flight to the wee hours. They delayed my spring break trip. The trip we are supposed to leave on today has been delayed 4 times now. Mind you there are clear skies. I am livid! By the time they nickel and dime you, it’s not any cheaper either. Only book Allegiant if you want to start and finish your vacation with a headache!

### "an early morning flight, delayed for 5+ hours"
Not Verified |  It was an early morning flight, delayed for 5+ hours. Compensation was an 1 dollar meal ticket where a burrito costs double that. So they made a profit over everyone who had to eat because of their 5+ hour delay. Should be illegal.

### "Awful customer service"
Make sure to read their small fine print, that I still have not been able to locate. The flight was delayed by 2 hours causing us to miss our connecting flight. The supervisor told us the only accommodation they could offer is a referral letter that allows us to sleep on the airport floor. I really thought he was kidding, he was not, We we’re offered no other solution and told it states when we book that they are not responsible if their flights are delayed. As I mentioned, I cannot locate this info. I called their customer service line and waited on hold for 2 hours only to be told "sorry there’s nothing we can do". They offered nothing. In fact I don’t even remember them apologizing. Awful customer service. We missed our flight by 10 minutes.

### "2 delays then a cancellation"
This airline blows. 2 delays then a cancellation. Had two rent a car drive 2.5 hours to another airport, purchased another ticket and that flight was delayed. Was supposed to be in Vegas at 7PM, ended up not getting in till 2am. Return flight was also delayed.

### "So done with Allegiant"
Not Verified |  So done with Allegiant. They cancel your flights and give you vouchers, so you cannot schedule your own life. I used the vouchers for family members, but needed to make a change to the car reservation - have been on hold for 2 hours and 18 minutes. And be very careful of their car rentals - it appears that they are a bit less expensive but the fine print says there are no taxes or fees collected from them. So really they turned out to be more expensive than other sites. I so hope they don't cancel these next flights for my family, because if they do then I will be stuck with more vouchers. My husband has encouraged me to ignore them until they just expire. I guess that is the best course of action.

### "won't travel on this airline anymore"
We bought 5 tickets to travel on October 14. Two or three weeks later we received an email that the flights had been cancelled. We contacted the airline and they did not tell us a reason why they canceled our flights. Something like this had never happened to us before. We won't travel on this airline anymore.

### "Disappointing customer service"
Not Verified |  Disappointing customer service. Flight was fine, travel was fine. Returned on an early evening flight and my luggage had been damaged. The handle had been damaged and I couldn't pull it up to use it. Stopped a nice man in the airport to try for me. Wasn't sure of the process to report it so I got online as soon as I got home and sent in a complaint within 8 hours. No response for weeks, sent another, no response. Left a message. Finally got a response telling me I didn't file my complaint timely because they had the recorded complaint down in June (my third attempt to contact them). Sad what has happened with customer service.

### "First and Last"
First and Last. Refused to check me in more then 2 hours prior to flight, despite emailing me and telling me that I needed to check in 3 hours prior to my flight to clear security on time. So I sat in a terminal for almost 2 hours before they staffed the counter again.

### "Obviously a staffing shortage"
Not Verified | Sanford to Flint. The flight was fine and on time, however when we landed in Flint it took 1 hour and 30-50 minutes to get our bags. No one was at the ticketing area to address our concerns and questions. In fact, no one was at ticketing to help customers arriving for a future flight. I was told by local personnel working at the airport that Allegiant hires young and inexperienced people who do not know how to manage others. Obviously there is also a staffing shortage at Flint airport.

### "Never again will I fly Allegiant Air"
Not Verified |  Allegiant cancelled flight while waiting in line at the airport. No notice, no assistance with rescheduling, no full refund. Only option offered was a Flight 3 days later. Or a 1/2 refund because we could fly out on a flight 2 hours away with Allegiant. Let me add there was no guarantee that either flight would leave as scheduled. Never again will I fly Allegiant Air.

### "it was the most miserable experience I have had"
Not Verified |  First of all it was my first time ever flying, absolutely no one around to help guide you or offer any assistance. Took me an hour and a half to make it in the building only to wait in line. Get pulled from line for last call to Bozeman Montana just to check in and told I have to pay $200 more right now or I can move it to Thursday. When I said let's move it to Thursday they then said I had to pay all over again. So they just made $400+ for free. I didn't have the money to pay. So now stuck in Vegas and my phone dies. Not even a half hour after all this I'm trying to figure it all out when a security guard approached me asking for proof of a ticket and since it's on my phone I couldn't show him. He tells me to leave the airport. I'm outside trying to figure it out when an hour later I decide to go to the other side and see who could help. When entering the building I'm being paged over intercom which you couldn't hear outside to pick up phone and dial 0. So I do and my daughter bought me a new ticket. Had to find charger to get proof. Once I do ticket is for thee next day and I had nowhere to go. I was not refunded a penny and it was the most miserable experience I have had in my 40 years of life I will never ever recommend this airline or airport for any reason. I would rather travel by buss than to ever deal with the rudeness of this airport and airline ever again.

### "Just the worst experience"
Just the worst experience. They cancelled the flight per email. Could not reach them by phone. Had to re-arrange everything by myself. No empathy. Would never try and fly with them again.

### "Will never use this airline again"
Not Verified |  The worst airline ever. If something goes wrong with baggage or flight (delay or cancellation) be prepared to figure it out yourself because this airline has no credible, willing employees who can assist you. The telephonic customer service is non-existent. I was on hold for 4 hours after flight was cancelled--and no one ever answered the phone. Had to make hotel, transport and flight reservations back home on another airline by myself and I also absorbed all the extra cost of doing that. Allegiant refused to pay. Will never use this airline again.

### "they seriously go above on beyond to accommodate you"
Not Verified |  My husband and I booked with Allegiant Air from Nashville to Harrisburg PA. I was furious when 10 min before our arrival to Nashville we were notified the flight was cancelled. I couldn’t believe it so we had to find a last min flight with different airline. Allegiant cancelling flight at last min was annoying and inconvenient. Since that flight cancelled these people have gone so far above and beyond to apologize and make it right the best they could. Including refunding our money giving us a flight credit and then sending us funds for our inconvenience! Please know they may be a smaller airline but if they have to cancel or make a change they seriously go above on beyond to accommodate you. I’m super impressed!

### "You’re better off walking"
Not Verified |  You’re better off walking. Used Allegiant 4 times. 3 of 4 were delayed by more than 3 hours. Zero stars. This has to be the worst airline since the Wright brothers invented flying.

### "don't recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  First and last experience with Allegiant Air. My return flight home for my two girls and I got canceled, we rescheduled and it got canceled again with no explanation, couldn't get through to anyone, not even a robot as the so called customer service # was either busy or not available. And forget getting any email response as I didn't. I missed more days of work, had to get a ride home which was very inconvenient with unexpected expenses with gas, food, hotel ... roads were full of delays with construction, drove about 8+ hours to hotel for rest and another 8 hours the next day, home at last! Absolutely don't recommend this airline!

### "worst travel experience for me"
The worst travel experience for me ever. My whole family went to the airport with our boarding pass just to find out that our flight was canceled. The reason is simply because they don't have enough passenger on the plane and they will lose money if they fly. But what about my booked hotel, rental car, tours at the destination? We lost thousands of dollars, our precious vacation time and the time spent on researching the trip. Our vacation turned out to be just staying at home and being disappointed. When asked if it is possible for us to be on other flights to get to our destination, the answer is of course no, because they don't work with any other airlines. Needless to say I will never use Allegiant Air and this review is to help you to avoid such terrible airline so that you can enjoy your vacation.

### "it has cheap prices for a reason"
Not Verified |  Allegiant Air canceled my flight in the last minute without any reasons. I tried to call their customer service but no one picked up, later on the phone was not even ringing. It was not because of bad weather or something. I tried to call and email later but no response at all. They just simply sent the email said the flight was canceled, not delayed, and it messed up my whole trip. We will never book our flights with Allegiant Air anymore, it has cheap prices for a reason. Very disappointed!

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service. Waited in line for over an hour for someone to even appear at check in/bag check. Employees were rude and unhelpful. There were many hidden costs. By the time all was said and done, we should have flown with a better airline. We didn’t end up actually saving any money, and it was a horrible experience. Do not fly this airline.

### "has no customer service"
Not Verified |  I can't even believe a company is in business that has no customer service. If you call their customer service number it doesn't work. If you click on the chat button on the website it says it's off line or not available, that leaves you to send them emails which they don't respond to. The airline cancelled my flight 3 hours before holiday weekend flight and just said "sorry we couldn't fulfil our promise". I've gotten no refund. So hard to imagine how a company can get away with charging for a flight. Cancelling it with no viable reason like weather, etc and then ignore customer and not give them their money back. I'd be so embarrassed if I represented this airline in any capacity.

### "tries to Nickle and dime you on everything"
Once again Allegiant has had another one of my flights either canceled or delayed more than two hours. In my last five trips using Allegiant one leg of each trip has been canceled or delayed. This airline continues to be a joke and even with cargo bins completely open the stewardess with still not allow you to put your personal item in the overhead bin this is after everyone has already boarded. Unfortunately this company tries to Nickle and dime you on everything and even their flights are not cheap anymore, but flying into ND seems the they are one of the only options. However if it's their screw up and has a 4+hour delay or even a cancelation they don't often allow any type of compensation and talking to a customer service representative will sometimes leave you on hold for 5+hours before you can even get through.

### "No rebooking, no rental cars and no hotels!"
Terrible customer service, flight was delayed three times and then canceled! Had to wait two hours to get our luggage and it wasn’t even loaded on a plane! Employees yelling at customers, was told that there was nothing they could do! No rebooking, no rental cars and no hotels! One agent specifically said “It’s not my problem”. Absolutely the worst Airport Experience I’ve ever had! I will never book through them again. I will pay the extra money through another airport with better service! !

### "no one cares to help or even care"
Not Verified |  We were on a family (12 people) vacation to Florida for a week. We got to our destination with little problems. One of our people needed to fly home early. We dropped him off in plenty of time to board his flight, which had already been delayed once. Later, his flight was delayed again, and then later canceled. Guest services did nothing to help him find a flight or figure out any other options. We ended up getting him a flight out of Orlando International Airport with a different airline (Delta). A few days later when 6 of us were headed to the airport at 3:30 am, we were notified that our flight was canceled. We opted to drive the 21 hours back home. We still received texts about the flight menu, on flight options, etc during our drive.We will never use this airline again. Too many issues and no one cares to help or even care!

### "I was appalled. This is not customer service"
It’s unreal to me what the airline industry has become and Allegiant is at the bottom of customer service. My flight was cancelled 30 mins prior to take-off after being delayed twice. Had it been cancelled earlier I would’ve had the whole day to drive to my 12 hour away destination which I already had to do. This cost me 2 days of my trip due to driving there and back, two nights in a hotel to stop during the drive, gas, time, heartache after a long anticipated vacation. This basically ruined it. After standing in line for a half hour after finding out my flight was cancelled, I was finally acknowledged by the gate agent that basically meandered around ignoring the huge line at her counter, I asked her to help me rebook my flight and she literally said “no, you can do that yourself on your mobile phone.” I was appalled. This is not customer service.

### "paid for garbage, received just that"
Syracuse to Ft Lauderdale. Allegiant is quite possibly the worst airline in history. Our flight to Fort Lauderdale was canceled (we were notified late via text message), and rebooking took over 3 hours. Their customer “service” line never picked up after 2 hours on hold. The next day, the subsequent flight was delayed due to “maintenance” for over 2 hours. I have never had a worse passenger experience on an airline, and would urge anyone NOT to book with them regardless of how cheap their tickets are. Sometimes you get what you pay for, and in this case, I paid for garbage and received just that.

### "Pick another airline"
Not Verified |  Left hand doesn't know what the right is doing. They directed us to the wrong concourse where we walked across the entire airport, then had to go through security twice. Never again. Pick another airline.

### "asked her if I'd be able to move"
Years ago, I promise that I would never fly this horrible rotten excuse for an airline again. Unfortunately it's the only plane from Phoenix going to Provo utah. So I booked my ticket and got to the airport and got on the airplane after choosing My premium seat which cost an extra $15. When the plane was completely boarded, there were nine seats in front of me that had extra leg room and were by the exit doors. Two people had paid the upgrade to there and one of the people's friends stuck in and got the free upgraded seat. After the horrible flight attendant came up to give the speech about being able to open the doors and had to give a verbal reply, I asked her if I'd be able to move from my cramped seat to one of the empty seven seats that were more roomy. Seven empty seats and she said it would be $50. That's absolutely ridiculous. Why not just for a matter of good customer service say okay no problem.

### "I will never give them my business again"
Not Verified |  Flight was cancelled within 30 minutes of departure. Apparently because a shortage of flight crew. They still flew the plane to its destination with nobody on it. This makes absolutely no sense. They did not offer a stay in a hotel or a connecting flight on another plane or airline. No electronic kiosks to get my ticket. Nobody at service desk to check bags. Customer service phone number gives a constant busy signal. This airline is complete garbage and I will never give them my business again.

### "would never book Allegiant again"
Not Verified | Cincinnati to Las Vegas. I’ll start by saying if you google Allegiant there’s a reservation.com site that pops up as if they’re affiliated with Allegiant whole time they’re NOT! After trying to book my flight online 5 times my purpose of using google was to get Allegiant Air phone number to book by phone instead. I spoke with an agent who pulled all my info up as if he had access to the Allegiant screen. They repeated back to me the names of all the travelers so I was certain he was apart of Allegiant staff. So everything goes through and they requested that I covered all my numbers besides the last 4 on the card I booked with along with my drivers license. This was my first time booking a flight by phone so it didn’t seem odd because I assumed they just wanted to be sure I was the card holder for the card I was using. So I booked a flight for a total of 5 people and a mini van through Allegiant site but rental was with Enterprise. About a week before my trip I called Enterprise to get a rough estimate on how much the insurance through them would be. Enterprise informed me that they had no reservations with me but did see one that had just recently been cancelled so of course I freaked! Then I remember they agent had given me his personal direct line in case I had any questions or concerns. He goes to tell me I cannot contact Enterprise OR Allegiant whatsoever! He then goes to say that if I were to do so again, the $3,300 for flights and rental would result in a total loss! Mind you when I booked my three older aunts needed wheel chair service! When we got to the airport they saw nothing about wheel chair services! So that annoyed us all! we was also told that it would be no problem that my aunt had her oxygen tank and she could fly with it. The oxygen was confiscated by TSA! The flight was terrible! We were on a 4 hour flight and no snacks or beverages were issued out. This entire time I thought I was saving a ton by doing a bundle deal with flight and rental car only to arrive in Vegas to enterprise and get hit with a $200 fee BEFORE insurance charges! So Allegiant doesn’t tell you about the hidden fees that comes along with you thinking you’re getting a deal! You even have to pay $5 for boarding passes! Could you imagine doing so for flights you have layovers on so that’s an extra $5 on top of there was a couple whose boarding tickets didn’t work SIX times! So they went from TSA back to front desk 6 times and 7th it finally worked! I would never book Allegiant again! If I could give them 0 stars I would!

### "I will never fly Allegiant again"
Not Verified |  Flew for a graduation left my 3 kids at home with grandma and this morning I get a text that the flight has been canceled with a link to my refund. I just got off the phone with Allegiant Air after a 2 hour wait on the phone to talk to a representative. I had to book the next available flight which was American Airlines for almost triple the price and upfront coast of over 1000$ I also have a rental car that I booked through them. They told me their next available flight is Friday because they only fly Mondays and Friday and that they do not offer expenses for rental cars or lodging and there max is refund is the ticket price and 200$ extra each ticket. They also told me the flight was not canceled due to weather etc but was just canceled. So here I am stuck in SD with out my kids unless I upfront 1000$ to get my wife and mother home late tonight. They were not apologetic and just said 200$ is there max and did not care that prices cost a ton to get a same day flight home or wait a week when they cover no costs, it feels illegal. I will never fly Allegiant again and will tell all my family to not fly them either. Does not matter that there ticket prices were cheaper because they dont actually fly and leave you stranded paying same day ticket prices desperate to get home to my kids and work.

### "My last several flights with Allegiant were delayed"
Not Verified |  The app doesn't work to add your bags, and the airline is more than happy to charge far more at the airport. Customer service line is perpetually busy. I finally connected, was on hold for 2 hours, and they never picked up. This is how they ensure to overcharge you for your bags in both directions. My last several flights with Allegiant were delayed for no reason.

### "staff were beyond rude"
Not Verified | Flint to Tampa. On 4-22-22 our return Flight from Tampa Fl was cancelled resulting in a $501.46 refund. It is 6/3/22 and I still have not received it. I have tried calling for a month and always a busy signal. When I finally got through, I waited 3 hours just to be disconnected. The staff at Flint Bishop Airport were beyond rude. You can feel their hatred of their jobs dripping form them. I have emailed also just to get an immediate reply that they received my email but if it is not about a flight within 48 hours they will get back to me in 4-6 weeks. I believe they are scamming the public. If they keep $500 of 1000 passengers money, they are making money on our money. The flight attendants made fun of people struggling trying to put their carry on in the overhead bin instead of helping them. Also made fun of people in wheel chairs. A far as their Honors Program for Veterans and Military, they don't honor their claim that they get priority seating. The scoffed at my husband when he showed his Veterans ID card. The plane was filthy. Do not use this airline. After this experience with inept staff, it's a wonder we made it back.

### "First and last time booking Allegiant"
3 hours before my flight is scheduled to leave, I receive a message that it was cancelled. No explanation and cant get ahold of anyone to reschedule me. Next flight I can find under 1000 bucks isnt until 3 days later. Refund is only a fraction of what I paid. First and last time booking Allegiant. I'm a travel agent too so I'll never booka client through them either.

### "Why did they only refund less than half of the ticket?"
Not Verified |  April 19, 2022 purchased a ticket for my sister to fly down to visit me. May 27, 2022 flight boarded and went out on tarmac, pilot turned plane around and went back to gate stating mechanical issues. Everyone got off plane and waited at gate area. 45 minutes later announced flight was canceled. Sister went to desk and advised refund since there wasn't another flight out until Monday the 30th which was the day she was to fly back home. She filled out paperwork to issue refund to my ccard. June 1st, 2022 a refund issued back to my ccard for 197.00 and of course you can not get thru to anyone on their customer service phone line and no online chat people available. Why did they only refund less than half of the ticket? did they think she was going to fly back to Michigan when she didnt have a flight to Florida? Absolutely ridiculous.

### "Really terrible service"
The flight out was ok, we waited a good 30 minutes to check in and had a 2 hour delay due to weather. The flight back was miserable. My husband got motion sickness and there was not any bags for him, he tried to go to the restroom and a flight attendant yelled at him and said to use the bag provided (still, no bag) so he had to grab one from a different passenger. She was extremely rude. Then once we landed we waiting over an hour (still waiting so let’s be real i don’t know how long exactly) for our baggage because they’re “short handed.” Really terrible service. Pretty pathetic.

### "Awful! Totally unreliable!"
Awful! Totally unreliable! They take your money and all you get is your holiday ruined and the added cost of having to book last minute with a competent carrier.

### "wanted to charge me 400 dollars to cancel"
Not Verified |  Had to cancel my flight because I tested positive for COVID 19. Waited on hold for 4 hours before giving up. Obviously had to cancel with positive COVID test but they wanted to charge me 400 dollars to cancel. That’s more than the original ticket? Why would I have to pay more to not fly? Horrendous and vile. What a terrible company.

### "Worst flight experience I’ve ever had"
Worst flight experience I’ve ever had. Not worth saving the money. There is absolutely no such thing as customer service with this airline. They lost my bags and after calling different numbers for about an hour, a woman told me that she hopes I will get my bag back and that she hopes they will contact me in the next 24 hours. I hope I get my bag back, too. The airline only has staff present in the airport when there is a flight, not one single staff member otherwise.

### "Absolute worst airline"
Not Verified | Columbus to Orlando. Absolute worst airline on planet earth, don’t fly for any price unless you want to fear for your life, have any mental health condition spiked, arrive late, be mistreated by the flight crew and hear a credit card sales pitch for half-hour flight while you’re stuck in a seat you can’t get up from. This airline has been my way to visit my family in Florida from Ohio for 6 years and I can confidently say after over 20 flights, if I could have afforded to fly any other way I would have every single time. Now that I can, I will not be retiring to Allegiant. Always a rough take-off, flight; and landing. Always delays based on crew mistakes (today's issue is as the captain literally lost the logbook, ya know; like the one that lets him know if the plane is safe to fly or not? ), we waited a half-hour until he “found it” and we took off for a flight in which passengers (complete strangers) literally held hands and prayed for a safe landing at our destination. This is one instance of this but is completely indicative of the trend I’ve experienced for years with this airline.

### "rude, uncaring, and I was horrified"
I've submitted the same complaint to Allegient 3 times. The concern has not been addressed, and the only responses I've received are automated emails from customer relations. The purpose of the planned trip was to return to Clearwater, FL, where I was vacationing with my husband and our dog when my father’s health took a severe downturn. I traveled from PIE to LEX on Allegiant flight G4 1917 on Jan 30, 2002, leaving our dog behind with my husband. My father passed away a day after I arrived in Lexington, and my husband traveled from Clearwater, FL to Lexington, KY on Allegiant flight G4 1917 on Feb 10, 2022, along with our dog, to join family during a very difficult time. My husband returned to Clearwater on Allegiant on Feb 17, 2022. I was not allowed to board my return flight to Clearwater on Feb 20, 2022 with our dog because the pet carrier did not meet Allegiant size specifications. However, our dog had traveled from PIE to LEX with my husband in the very same pet carrier on Feb 10, 2022. Also, I purchased the pet carrier based on the fact that it was identical to a pet carrier that was on my Allegiant flight from PIE to LEX on Jan 30, 2022. The passenger with the in-cabin pet on my Jan 30, 2022 flight told me that she had flown from LEX to PIE using the same pet carrier. Allegient allowed my dog to travel one way with my husband but did not allow her to make the return trip with me. This is incongruous and inequitable and leaves passengers in unfortunate situations. Enforcement of Allegiant specifications would appear to be at the whim of the staff on duty, rather than being consistently applied by all staff at all Allegiant service counters. The staff at the Allegiant counter at LEX, including the Manager on duty, did not appear to have empathy for my situation, and did not care that the pet carrier was allowed on a prior Allegiant flight. They were rude, uncaring, and I was horrified. Allegiant is not consistent with enforcement of its pet carrier policies, nor do they respond to only complaints to Customer Relations.

### "they just give you the run around"
Not Verified |  The worst experience I’ve had with an airline. I flew an employee down for work. He got to the gate 20 minutes before the flight was supposed to take off and saw it leave the terminal. I called Allegiant to try and get a refund. After waiting for 2 1/2 hours, I spoke to an agent for less than 10 minutes explaining the situation. She said “I shouldn’t even be talking to you this long since you cannot verify the information.” I gave her all the information. She was just embarrassed because I called her out for not accommodating or making any sense. It’s clear they make you wait on hold for an inconceivable amount of time then if you are patient enough to get a “support” representative they just give you the run around then hang up on you. It’s pathetic an airline like this even exists.

### "I will never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Yesterday night I got held up at TSA due to carrying a diaper bag that contained formula, bottled water and infant body wash. I showed up to board the plane 2 minutes after the 15 minute grace period due to running through the airport with an infant on my chest, a diaper bag and a bag of clothes for myself and my child. They would not let me board the plane or speak to anyone about it and were so rude I began to get upset. I explained that this was my first time flying with my baby as I am a new mom , but also under immense depression due to the passing of a family member. Despite telling them I’m flying for my fathers funeral, seeing my infant and also had 2 TSA members run ahead of me to explain to them I was coming and held up due to testing everything in my diaper bag. They were extremely rude, wouldn’t direct me to someone to at least switch my ticket and completely shewed me away. I have flown with this airline multiple times but I will never fly with them again. I also cannot reach anyone for a refund or credit

### "acted like we were an inconvenience"
Our flight was delayed by over an hour, which I understand sometimes happens, but there was no communication. No one could tell us when we would board or land and the flight info was never updated. Employees acted like we were an inconvenience trying to find out when to tell our rides to arrive at the airport. Then my luggage was lost. Neither airport has Allegiant baggage support or customer support. Their customer service number gives a busy signal and the few times I’ve gotten through directs me to the website and hangs up. I’ve submitted 3 requests online for lost luggage, but received no response. Someone at St. Pete accidentally answered my phone call and said she’d call back in one hour, 5 hours ago. The Memphis Airport Authority told me they get calls like mine everyday, but there’s no way to hold them accountable. Oh and if enough time passes, they’re not liable. It’s almost been 24 hours of calling and emailing and I’ve spoken to one person who won’t call back. I’m leaving out so many other terrible experiences.

### "Terrible experience in general"
The absolute worst airline I have ever flown. We were mistreated my the staff just because we waited to get off the plane,  because we had one infant and one toddler. This is far from a family friendly airline. Terrible experience in general.

### "should be ashamed of themselves!"
Worse experience ever! On 5/13/2022 I drive from Louisville to Cincinnati to catch a flight to Vegas at 6:00am. I arrived to the airport right at 4 and was in what I thought was the line I needed to be in to check my bag only for them to keep calling for Denver flights and never once mentioned Las Vegas. So several of us made our own line since the Denver flight was their main priority while I’ve already been waiting to check in my bag for almost 45 min which was 5:00 am by that time. So I was next in line and looked away for literally one minute to turn around and see that an old lady had jumped in from of me. Although I was in a panic pressed for time I let it slide because I do respect my elders little did I know she was blind and needed special services which took around 20 min for them to check her bag then walk her to her seat then waits with her for someone to accompany her. So by the time I was able to check in the lady that worked with Allegiant was extremely rude and immediately told me I couldn’t check my bag as it was too late (mind you I had been in that line for over an hour at that point). So she told me I could go through TSA with my checked bag. So me being determined to go on my trip that I had planned months prior I attempted it. Once I waited in the TSA line for another 20 min waiting on the dogs to sniff everything then they had to search my suitcase bc it had all of my big bottles of toiletries that I had just bought so they could throw them all away. By this time it’s 5:50 so with tears in my eyes I asked the TSA gentleman to please hurry bc I was about to miss my flight. By time he was done it was already 6am and I had just missed my flight! So I immediately call Allegiant to express my frustration after waiting on hold for over two hours just to speak with someone I explained the situation and although they admitted to it being their fault and me being there in plenty of time because of the unorganization. They refused to give me a refund and only gave me $842 towards a future flight although my total flight was $1400. I’ve flown with Allegiant multiple times and have never had a bad experience before now. So not only did I miss out on my first time experience to Vegas I also missed out on a music festival that I had paid $500 for months prior. Because of how rude and unorganized Allegiant in Cincinnati was/is, I will never be using Allegiant again. This is wrong on so many levels and Allegiant should be ashamed of themselves!

### "the experience is terrible"
I have flown Allegiant Fort Lauderdale to Concord, NC many times. Every time I have to contact customer service, the experience is terrible. No more pandemic, but there's still a 2 hour wait time, they suggested calling off peak hours between 9pm and 3am. The chat feature indicated it was working many times, but it was not. The best option was email. The flights have always been good but the customer service is absolutely disgusting. I can no longer support this airline and will fly to Charlotte via a different airline in the future. If you are considering flying with Allegiant, I would reconsider. Seriously. You'd think I would have saved money because of their fares. Wrong, it's actually cost me more than flying a major airline. Just don't do it. Reconsider.

### "Horrible business practices"
Horrible business practices. I arrived at Midway six hours early. Checked my bag. When I arrived in Fort Walton, my bag never showed. I later found out they put my bag on a plane that went to North Carolina. Although it was tagged for Fort Walton. I immediately reported my lost bag, that's how I found out where it was. They said they would mail it to my house. A week later, it arrived with the entire width of the front ripped. I took pictures and emailed them upon it arriving. Forgot calling, you can't get through. They said to tell them how much I paid and when I bought the bag. I stated it was $95 and it was bought 2016. That was in March. Today, May 16th I just received and email for a virtual card for $38. They claim depreciation. Am I wrong but isn't a suitcase an item you either use or don't use. I don't think you trade it in for new ones like cars. And 60 dollars less than what I paid for it.

### "Very unprofessional behavior"
Very poor staff at the checkin. She was on the edge while getting the boarding pass, we had to pay 10$ extra as we didn't check-in online, then once done paying she proceeded to throw the checked bag on the conveyor and just stood there. Very unprofessional behavior

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified | Phoenix to Tri-Cities. I have been trying to contact anyone at Allegiant by phone and chat for the past 3 days. Their policy to change or cancel flights was updated for covid so it is only $25 but it has to be 7 days prior to the flight. We tested positive for covid 4 days before our flight. The only options were to cancel and lose our entire purchase amount or reschedule for some future trip we don't have plans for (only $20 off each ticket after fees anyways). We responsibly did not go to the airport and get on the plane where we could have infected other people, but it almost seemed like that was encouraged by Allegiant since there were no viable options to cancel without completely losing our money. Waited on hold for hours each day just to be disconnected. Terrible customer service and Covid policy, 24 hours I could understand but a lot can happen within 7 days.

### "The airline stranded 7 people with no way home"
6 days before our spring break trip, our flight home from Sarasota on 4/9/22 was cancelled by Allegiant. Since we could not get through to Allegiant's customer service department, we sent an email requesting a 1/2 refund so that we could book another flight home. With no notification, Allegiant cancelled our entire trip, including the flight to Sarasota. When we rebooked the same flight they charged us an additional $500 for the same flight we had booked since October 2021. There was no one for us to talk to on the customer service line (waited on hold 6+ hours once), no one available to chat with on-line and no one available to help us at the airport. After 4 separate trips to the airport, we finally found an Allegiant manager who then informed us that he could offer us no help. The airline stranded 7 people with no way home during spring break week and offered no assistance. We had to find another airline (Delta) and paid $1000 more for a flight from Tampa, just to get home because Allegiant offered no other options. We have read on-line that they have offered $100 cash vouchers per passenger for their inconvenience. But when we finally got through on their customer service line today, their service representative, refused to allow us to speak with a manager and then hung up on us.

### "Super upsetting and really badly organized by this airline!"
Not Verified |  After speaking with 3 different representatives from the airlines regarding my Service dog, without them mentioning the need to submit the form 48hrs prior to departure, I showed up to the airport, with all the required forms and they then refused my registered service-dog. The H.R. department of Allegiant Air in Cincinnati were the department that denied entry, don’t really know why they had the final say-so? One of the representatives showed the one and only place obscurely placed notice where it stated 48hrs notice. You would think it would be more prominently posted as well as mentioned by the 3 different representatives I spoke with. Super upsetting and really badly organized by this airline! Last time I’ll book with them!

### "will never have my business again"
Not Verified |  So very disappointed with the customer service! I chose this airline because they offered direct flights from Indianapolis to Austin, TX. I bought 6 tickets for my family. Later, I received a notice that they were changing my return flight. Due to the airline arriving much later, my nephew was no longer able to go. I tried to change the passenger name on their web page but it said I call customer service. First, I called on 6 different occasions and the phone rang as "busy". When I finally go through to a recorded message, they told me that the wait time was 2 hours and 40 minutes. They recommended that I call back between 9 pm and 4 am. I did that and still had to wait for 2 hours. When I finally reached a live person, she told me that they could change the name if I paid $75. I first asked about the message that I heard repeatedly over the last two hours which stated that their change fee was reduced to $25 due to COVID. She told me she didn't know what I was talking about - she asked her supervisor and told me I would have to pay the $75. I expressed my concern that $75 was their normal non-COVID rate and there should be some concession for the flight change just for good customer service. She indicated that she could refund the ticket but it would require cancelling all of my tickets and rebooking it which could lead to additional "air fares". I couldn't trust that she would get it right and my entire trip wouldn't be cancelled so I paid the $75. Congratulations, Allegiant. You took an extra $75 from me and will never have my business again.

### "worst experience I've ever had"
The worst experience I've ever had. It was my first time booking with the airlines and will definitely be my last. First and foremost, this this airlines has the only direct flight from OKC to Las Vegas. The day of my flight, actually 20 minutes before the flight to Vegas took off, we were all notified that our returning flight had been cancelled. The worst part about it is that they sent the voucher and information through text which seemed very sketchy. The passengers around me actually didn't believe it was from the airlines until we saw the confirmed email of cancelation. The staff didn't even tell us while we were sitting there. I had to book another returning flight with another airline which was double my original flight. What's even worse is that all flights from the moment my flight was canceled, Allegiant canceled all of their flights for the next few weeks! With that being said, all the phone prompts stated and even emails as well said that if no action was taken the amount would be refunded to the card on file. That was a lie. I waited till after my trip to see if the money was there. It said 72hrs so that was also a lie. I called the support line which was complete trash but was able to get a hold of someone who was very helpful. They finally issued my refund (I have email proof of my refund and what I'm owed) which seemed that if I hadn't have called they would have kept my money. They then said I would received my refund in 5-7 business days. Those days have now passed and the money has not been placed back into my account. I've waited on hold for 3 hours while I work for someone to pick up and they still haven't. I've been promised a refund twice and have not received it. This airlines is definitely taking money away from their customers. I will never fly with them again.

### "such awful customer care"
I have never experienced such awful customer care! I had to fly to Ohio for a sudden family death. My grandfather passed away unexpectedly, after I had to have emergency surgery in April for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Needless to say, funds were short, time frames were sporadic, and emotional distress is at an all time high. We found a “really good deal” via Allegiant Air at Toledo Airport. I arrive an hour prior to my flight (yes, I’m aware “2 hours is recommended”, Toledo airport is small enough I can walk end to end in under 10 minutes.) The guy at the airport won’t let me on. Okay. I spend 3 days trying to get ahold of someone from customer service. Finally get through, explain the situation, and the guy tells me because i arrived an hour prior, and not to “recommended” 2 hours, that it was a no show and I forfeit my funds! Absolutely not. I have arrived at this airport 30 MINS prior to departure, and never had an issue. The guy from customer service continues to tell me I simply forfeited my funds. You can escalate higher, but it won’t matter”. Neither my family nor friends will ever use Allegiant air.

### "the worst, hands down"
Destin to Minneapolis. This company is the worst, hands down, never again. I booked my rental car through Allegiant and needed to modify it due to a flight change. Was put on hold for over 6 hours and then they disconnected me. Called the next day, the morning of our flight, was on hold for over 3 hours and had to hang up as it was time to board my plane. I emailed Allegiant over a week ago about this issue, still no response. At the airport today, with my veteran husband. According to their website we’re each allowed 2 checked bags as long as we’re on the same itinerary. Nope, lady insisted I needed a spouse ID card as well. I asked for the manager, who just stood there and did nothing. I asked for her to connect me with the Customer care center. She handed me a card with the same phone number as I called last week, 702-505-8888 for which no one will answer, ever. My only option was to pay the additional $100 to check 2 bags. So far, this trip with Allegiant has cost me an additional $200. I’m aware they change for everything, however, this never should’ve happened! Lesson learned. I will never ever fly Allegiant Air again. I would give them a second chance if I knew they had a working Customer Care center, which they clearly don’t.

### "spend the extra money to fly on a credible airline"
Not Verified |  One of the worst experiences I’ve ever had. Perfect weather on both ends with multiple delays on both ends. To include being stuck in the plane before taking off and after. I understand there are employee shortages but whatever you do spend the extra money to fly on a credible airline. I’ll be surprised if this outfit isn’t bought out within the next year. Poor communication, poor customer services. The flight attendants were nice. Other than that poor quality.

### "Do not fly with them"
Orlando Sanford to Lexington. Do not fly with them. First, they charge you an astronomical amount for carry-ons. They also don’t offer refunds in the event of bereavement. I now have a plane ticket for an airline that I don’t usually fly with that won’t refund me my money even though I can’t fly because my uncle passed and his funeral is on the day of my flight.

### "Will start shopping other airlines even if I have to pay more"
Not Verified |  Though they have great price and they used to have good service now you can not count on them being anywhere near their departure time. I have flown with them almost monthly for close to a year and airlines seems to always are having delays or cancellations. Will start shopping other airlines even if I have to pay more. I feel my time is worth as much as theirs and they offer no perks for poor service on their part.

### "Horrible airline"
Not Verified | Ashville to Orlando. Horrible airline from all aspects of employees. Not one bit of customer service with this airline. This company needs a complete revamp all the way around. I wouldn't recommend to anyone.

### "you will be highly disappointed"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline ever. They cancel the flight for no reason and then lie about it so you can't get your money back or your flight rescheduled. I hope this airline is soon shut down for scamming people out of their flights and money. Save your time and money and do not fly with this company, you will be highly disappointed.

### "Terrible experience"
Terrible experience. Original ticket was $109 and another $20 for a carry on. Then they charged me another $50 for a checked bag and another $50 for it being over 40 pounds. I fly a lot and have never had to pay extra for a carry on, and every other airline I fly on allows checked bags to be 50 pounds. The Allegiant website does not make any effort to alert the traveler to these significant differences. In flight they offered drinks, but ALL were at a cost, even water. I cannot recommend anyone fly Allegiant. If you have to other option be aware they will charge very high prices for things other airlines do for free.

### "didn't even give up a free bag of chips"
This allegedly two hour flight was delayed from Newark to Destin. The pilot told us all 90 minutes ago there was a small plane crash at Destin. My dad was waiting an hour there and saw NO police, balances, etc. I asked for water or snacks and we all got zilch and have been sitting here two hours and nothing is happening. Allegiant didn't even give up a free bag of chips. Your airline sucks.

### "I don’t think I could recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  I rented a car through Allegiant and it was in unacceptable condition and I was told that I had to work with Allegiant to get a refund. I have tried several times to call customer service and sent several emails with no response. I don’t think I could fly or recommend this airline to anybody in the future.

### "delayed and delayed and delayed"
Allegiant flights have terrible seating, big aisles with small uncomfortable seats. They're cheap so you use them, but then they can make an entire trip bad. They delayed and delayed and delayed for hours, until at night, last minute, they cancel with only offering a lousy refund as they only have flight certain days. This causes everyone to panic and have to buy a hotel and find a way home. Absolutely poor but we will see how customer service is with my reasonable request for them to accommodate my purchases for new flight and hotel.

### "Poor customer service!"
I was not allowed to move up to a front row seat for more leg room (just one seat in front of mine) even though there were 2 open seats. I had bundled my flight so I could pick my seat, have a carry on and check a bag. I asked the agent to change it prior to boarding the plane, but it would cost me. After I was on the plane, I asked the flight attendant if I could move and she told me no because that seat costs $30. I told her I bundled my ticket, but she said it didn’t matter. Poor customer service! To top it off, I was not allowed TSA pre-check b/c it wasn’t listed on my boarding pass. So why bother having the pass when they can deny at any time. I asked why and they said it was Allegiant that makes the decision. I do not have a record and not a risk. Just a 55 year old woman.

### "I would not fly again with Allegiant"
My flight coming from Asheville, NC was cancelled on April 26. I re-booked for April 25, that flight was delayed 3 hs. I lost money for not refundable hotel accommodations and parking for my car and one day vacation. Very unreliable company. I would not fly again with Allegiant.

### "they are a joke"
Not Verified | Destin to Grand Rapids. I had an emergency flight to Michigan after my mother had a stroke. The flight was scheduled for take-off in the afternoon. Allegiant Air kept delaying/changing our flight time. Finally, at 9:30pm (when the airport was closing) they cancelled our flight claiming "We had to time our pilot out for exceeding flight hours". Our pilot landed from Nashville, TN in Destin, FL. All of the passengers and staff were abandoned at the airport. We were told no refund could be provided but they would get us on a flight at 7:30am the following morning. They changed our flight on us 4x - we didn't end up boarding until almost 24 hours later. They issued us vouchers for $100 ea (x2) to be used anytime between June 2021 - June 2022 for an apology. Surprise, they closed the VPS/Destin concourse for an expansion and aren't booking any flights until September 2022. There is no other Allegiant Air route within a 3-5 mile radius from me. So, not only did I lose 2 full days of seeing my ill mother, they gave us vouchers knowing we couldn't use them. A concourse expansion is a planned construction project and to shut it down for over 6 months and not let me know is wrong. I need to get back to Michigan to see my ill mother for Mother's day 2022 and now have no choice but to drive or spend $ on another airline. This used to be my favored airline, and now they are a joke.

### "Stupid, inconsiderate, and uncaring"
Allegiant has declined so much over the years. Have been reading horrible reviews about them, but decided to give them a chance. The last flight I took was delayed for “mechanical issues” flying to my destination. And flying back was delayed because they overbooked by 2 seats. Stupid, inconsiderate, and uncaring. This will be the last time I give Allegiant the benefit of the doubt! !

### "our flight has been delayed 6 times"
Horrible service. 2 weeks ago our return flight was canceled. 9 of us booked in January. Day of flight our flight has been delayed 6 times. We have missed a show we purchased for 12 of us (rest of party are waiting for us in Vegas) which cost over $1200 for the tickets.

### "do not fly with this airline"
Not Verified |  Please do not fly with this airline. I am in Florida with my mother and had a flight back to Michigan at 7. Our flight has now been delayed 5 times to 10:30 due to lack of preparation on the airlines part. We have 3 hours to drive after we land in flint and won't get home till 4 am now. I spoke to allegiant desk at the airport they didn't even know if the plane that is coming to get us had even taken off yet.

### "advised me the cut off was 5 minutes ago"
My flight was on April 22, 2022 at 7:30am. I downloaded the app on my phone the night before and checked in to my flight with in 12 hours of my flight time. I got to the airport at 6am and went and sat in the Cafe by the security clearance until it was closer to time to get to my gate. At 6:30 I went to the security line, I got the the front of the line and was advised by a very nice TSA agent that I wasn't checked in on the app and would need to go to the front desk. I got in line and waited for an Allegiant representative as I approached the counter I explained the situation with the representative who was very condescending and even grabbed my id out of my hand with force. She advised me the cut off was 5 minutes ago and that I would have to reschedule my flight and pay a new fee. I told her that I don't want to reschedule because this is a very important military event I have to be at. I just needed to check in and she yelled that there is sign on the counter and that is the rules, if I didn't like it I could call the 800 number and to get out of her line. I did move to the side and called Allegiant and spoke with a representative to whom I explained my situation and she advised me to go back to the counter and have the agent check me in since they have been having glitches with the app lately. I did so but was told that didn't put a key note in so shes not going to do anything and I could go to another airline but she don't have time to deal with this pettiness and walked to the back room even the other employees standing there kept apologizing for her rudeness. I got home and sat on hold for over 8 hours and no one answered.

### "I am done with Allegiant"
I've booked 4 flights with them in total ever, they canceled 2 of the 4. I am done with Allegiant. I have an upcoming flight to their "hub" airport, hopefully, they don't cancel.

### "What A disaster!"
Not Verified |  Advised of 2.5 hour delay, too late to change our Uber which was already in route. Got to the airport and no one staffs the airline Check-in service desk! A line had already formed and would be standing there waiting for appropriately 4 hours! As Seniors, we went and sat down in a different area but had no airport amenities such as dining until after we check in God knows when! On the other end, our hosts will be inconvenienced until after midnight on a work day. What A disaster!

### "first bad review I’ve ever given"
I purchased a round trip flight. My returning flight got canceled. They emailed me, so I went into their website to change it, and the website confirmed my flight had changed. I thought all was good. Proceed to day before I depart, I’ve heard nothing. So I check and I am not booked for the flight. So, I called, after 3 HOURS on hold they proceeded to tell me that because they “didn’t see the change”. All they could offer was a different flight (I had a hard return date). They didn’t offer anything other than a different flight that was DAYS later. I don’t expect much, I don’t care about a refund, but come on. I asked them if there were any fees for canceling if I booked the new flight (just in case I couldn’t get a flight with another airline), I was told no. Luckily I found another flight on the day I needed to be back. So, I proceed to cancel my flight that is days later with Allegiant and was told it was a $95 fee to cancel. I already paid for my flight, and extra for a carry on, now they want to nickel and dime me even more? Especially after they are the ones with a faulty system? I called again (only an hour on hold, this service agent was much nicer). Luckily the fees were bi-passed and a refund was issued. I’m the type of person who only writes reviews for exceptionally great and extremely terrible experiences. This experience and their service was so bad that this is the first “bad review” I’ve ever given in my life. Yes, the flights are “cheap”, but after this I’m willing to pay more to make sure I don’t have to deal with allegiant (or anyone like them) ever again!

### "Get it together Allegiant Air"
Not Verified |  If I could give this airline a 0, for not only their online booking, but also their so called customer service I would! So frustrating! I have the Allegiant credit card that I had a $300.00+ fraud on my account, which the bank was able to fix and send me a replacement card. I have been online and calling for 2 weeks and have never been able to book online or book through customer service. They tell you to leave a message but the message system is always full. I went into their website to send my concerns to corporate only to get another error message and could not “send” the message! I managed a customer service arena for 35 years and this is totally unacceptable! I must say that I love being able to fly from Maine to Florida in a little over 3 hours but only if I’m able to book a flight!! Get it together Allegiant Air before your stock crashes and you are no more!

### "best service I could ever ask for"
Not Verified |  Today, my wife and I had to cancel our trip from Knoxville — to Phoenix, the cancellation was due to ear infection and was impossible to fly. The decision was finally made about 2 hours before flight. I was advise from managed your trip to call — after several calls I was unable to cancel the flight. To my surprise, 30 mins before the flight I get call from the local agent asking if were able to arrive in time. I explained that we could not make the flight and I tried to advise Allegiant air, we would not be able to fly today. The agent, advise me that she would call back within 30 mins to help me rebook my next flight. In 30 mins, I get the call, agent was able to assist me with a credit for my next flight. The Knoxville Agent went out her way to help us. n 30 years of flying, this was best service I could ever ask for. Thank You Allegiant Air, the Knoxville Agent.

### "they do not have any customer service"
Not Verified |  So we’ve flown Allegiant multiple times over the years and almost every time we have either a delay, rude attendants, or the current situation we are in now a cancelled flight. As soon as we were notified of the cancellation we attempted via Allegiant.com, the Allegiant App, via phone by several different numbers, and even attempted to chat live with an agent. The line was continuously busy for hours, the live agents are offline, the app and website both will say either “something went wrong” or “prices have changed” preventing you from making any changes. I even went to their Facebook page to attempt communication with someone. So what I’m trying to say is, don’t expect help resolving any issues that may arise from this company because they do not have any customer service what so ever.

### "I will never fly Allegiant again"
You get what you pay for with Allegiant. The airline is extremely cheap and offers the worst customer support as a result. Both of our flights to and from our destination were canceled. Both times the airline offered a small voucher and when I decided to cancel and use a different airline on the return flight, they did not refund me my full money for the tickets. Customer support is absent, you will never get a hold of them. The company uses horrible integrity and treats customers terribly. I will never fly Allegiant again and suggest anyone else do the same.

### "Not even an apology or explanation from crew/staff"
Over 10 hours in the airport from delays. Not even an apology or explanation from crew/staff. Customer service literally replied to my email a week after I had sent it. Would not recommend.

### "staff were very pleasant"
Not Verified | I was apprehensive (a gross understatement) to fly on Allegiant. I needed to go to Titusville for 2 nights and thought I would try Allegiant because it leaves from Harrisburg (very close to my house) and arrives in Sanford (easy airport). I fly a lot and am fortunate to have experienced some excellent airlines in coach, business and first class. I was NOT looking forward to flying Allegiant and was reading to have delayed flights, dirty planes and rude staff. My flights were ON TIME, the ground and in flight staff were very pleasant and the planes were as clean (or dirty) as my previous flights on other airlines. My flight to Sanford was on an A319 while the return was an A320. The seats on the A319 are VERY VERY CLOSE with little leg room and are very much like lawn chairs! The return flight seats had a normal amount of leg room. Seat do not recline. My only complaint would be with the Sanford airport and not the airline. Because the airport is small it is very easy to navigate and car rental and returns are a breeze. While waiting for my flight I ordered a drink. Well alcohol is $15 a drink! I am fairly use to 'airport pricing' and thought this was a bit high. Last month in Baltimore I ordered the same and it was a 'mere' $10 for the same. Maybe the price to pay for the small and easy airport convenience.

### "the worst budget airline customer service I have ever encountered"
I would not use Allegiant Air again if they paid me to do so! I have been attempting to simply upgrade my car bundle to a larger car for weeks and weeks and weeks. The car rental service (Enterprise) cannot assist me, because they say it was booked thru Allegiant. I have called and called and called and called and have been placed on hold for periods that exceed 2 hours. No one ever answers, and the call just hangs up on you after you have been holding for extended periods of time. In fact, often the customer service line simply rings busy. I have tried their online chat and there are never representatives available. I have sent multiple emails and never get a response. It is not worth the tiny savings you think you are getting. They indicate that you can make changes and even cancel for free but trust me, you will never reach anyone to help you to do so. Avoid them. This is the worst budget airline customer service I have ever encountered.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Terrible customer service regarding cancelling flights, baggage etc. I tried calling Allegiant for over two weeks daily and never got through to them to discuss a cancellation I wanted to make - it cost me $100 Baggage. I flew from point A to point B and then with the same carry on I was pulled out of the boarding line and told it was too big by 1/4 inch and charged an additional $50 on top what of had already paid for a carry on. At least be consistent if you’re going to gouge customers.

### "an example of poorly run operations"
Not Verified |  Allegiant cancelled the flight due to rain and they refused to do anything about my return trip. So there I was thousands of miles from home, stuck to find another airline at the other airport to try find some way home. They never offered any type of remedy. No amount of cost savings is worth the stress and anxiety of trying to find a flight on Easter week. I was such a fan of Allegiant until this disaster. What an example of poorly run operations.

### "seen their last dime from my family"
We have friends who frequently use them and they have recently told us that they have had delays and even last minute cancellations. We booked a quick weekend getaway to Las Vegas. The flight out from Belleville was delayed almost an hour, not in love with this but, hey, we’re going to Vegas so let’s just be happy and enjoy. That’s what we did and it all worked out. After spending a few days there we were enjoying our last afternoon and preparing for dinner and a show and I hear my wife say “OH NO!” We found out around 6:00p.m. That our flight for the next morning had just been cancelled. Saturday evening plans had to be put on hold. We tried finding alternate flights and Allegiant had none to offer. Other airlines were filling up faster than we could book seats. We had a 3 way call with our in-laws as well as our daughter and we were all trying to get seats on a flight so we could get home today (Sunday) to pick our pet up and prepare for the workweek. Finally our daughter text us at 10:00 Saturday night telling us Southwest had just opened a flight that would depart at 5:30a.m. this morning 04/03/2022. We were fortunate enough to be able to jump online and get 2 seats booked so we could get home. Those tickets cost us and additional $1,400. Allegiant messaged us telling us how sorry they were and that they would give us a $150 voucher to be used on a future flight They wanted us to know they were here for us and appreciate us. We aren’t interested in a voucher! We are interested in our money back and the difference we had to pay because of the inept business practices of Allegiant Air. We don’t know if we are even getting a refund on our tickets because when we try to call they are experiencing higher than normal call volume and our wait time is approximately 2 hours. They suggested we call between the hours of 9:00p.m. and 4:00a.m. Pacific time. Allegiant left us and a lot of other customers high and dry. If possible they have seen their last dime from my family. Not sure how long a business model like this one can last but I’d say things don’t look good for them!

### "cancelled our flight while we were checking in"
Not Verified |  They cancelled our flight while we were checking in and they didn’t notify us in any way. We stood there trying to find something else and they were no help. The only available flight for us was Thursday. We will never use them again. We ended up having to drive 12 hours home.

### "Bad business practices!"
Bad business practices! It seems they are cancelling flights based on the amount of passengers not on the amount of employees. Canceling last minute and saying you can schedule another flight at no extra charge but making none available. When you go back to their website you can book but not at original price. They have done this several times.

### "cancelled 2 hours before departure"
Not Verified |  Our flight was completely cancelled 2 hours before departure. Due to a little rain shower in Tampa. Completely ridiculous. They couldn’t even just delay the flight a couple hours. Completely cancelled it. Even during spring break. When many families including mine have had trips planned for months. Never flying Allegiant Air again.

### "get much less than you pay for"
Not Verified |  Avoid this airline. You get much less than you pay for. Initial price sounds great but when they ruin your vacation you will wish you flew on a real airline. Customer service is horrible. They just don't care. On my most recent trip they ruined my golf club case (tore the handle off and didn't even tuck it inside so I could fix it - it was just gone). They took two weeks to review my claim and then denied it (of course) because their policy is that you have to file it within 4 hours of the flight arrival. Their was not one at the airport to file a claim with. So after waiting for my damaged bag to arrive, then getting home, the 4 hour window was expired. If you sucker for the cheap price Allegiant offers, you will be disappointed on what a miserable experience it turns out to be.

### "Flight got cancelled last minute"
Flight got cancelled leaving Fort Wayne to Florida last minute on a Saturday almost at midnight. So after waiting several hours at the airport since 5:30pm we were not able to leave. Next flight was not available until Monday night, so we lost several days of our already booked vacation and paid for hotel rooms. Mondays flight was then delayed and we didn't get into Florida until after midnight and by the time we got the the hotel we had essentially lost another day.

### "I've had it with them"
Not Verified |  The return flight of purchased round trip flight was cancelled by Allegiant Air unexpectedly a few days prior to the trip. Email and customer service number direct you to manage your travel online. Tried multiple times to change our return flight to no avail. Kept getting error code despite trying to change flight to other available flights on work computer, home laptop, and via app on cell phone. Called customer service number and says 2 hour wait time. 6 hours and 20 minutes later no answer just same message over and over stating someone will be with me shortly. Called my wife's phone also and that phone has been on hold for 3 hours with no answer either. Really only chose to fly Allegiant as it is only direct flight from Asheville to South Florida which is "easier" with kid but after multiple flight delays and cancelled flights I've had it with them. Rather pay more to take connecting flight with Delta or drive to larger airport for direct flight.

### "Never again will I fly Allegiant"
Get to the airport at 4:15 eastern time. Flight was to leave out at 6:30. Allegiant has 2 gates at Indianapolis. B3 was schedule to depart to New Orleans and B4 to Las Vegas. I see several flight attendants and pilots coming and going from each gate. They then switched gates, and then delayed the New Orleans flight by an hour saying due to weather. Both planes were in the gates so I knew it was a lie. Weather is clear across the board for that flight. Las Vegas flight boards and departs, and then New Orleans is canceled. Next available flight was 4 days later! Every other airline flying to New Orleans was over $600. Allegiant offered nothing, just a $30 refund for the $103 flight i purchased! I’m from Louisiana and was up to plan my wedding. Finally found a $211 flight out of St. Louis to Dallas, and Dallas to New Orleans. Took a $100 Uber to Terre Haute where my mother picked me up! Never again will I fly Allegiant. If you can’t sell enough seats and blame it on weather what’s the point of even keeping the flight scheduled until after it was supposed to depart!

### "flight was 4 hours delayed"
Every single thing is wrong about this flight. They delay the flight and tell us due to a technical error and then say because stewardess didn’t show up on time and then the stewardess shows up and says they messed up on her schedule and just called her in. Lie. Then I had 3.5 hours on hold to talk to customer service and no answer. Then the flight was 4 hours delayed and the returning flight took off 10 minutes EARLY so I missed the flight. I call and they tell me they are sorry and.

### "I will never fly this airline again"
Where do I begin? It may sound dramatic but being stuck at the gate on a plane for over an hour while the airline figures out how there are two extra people on the plane! First the seats and space is tiny. I’m average height and my knees are almost touching the seat back in front of me. The seats are incredibly uncomfortable and there is zero elbow room. The seats do not recline so my what would have been landing at 12pm now will be after 1am. I will never fly this airline again.

### "never fly with them again"
I had a flight booked for 3/20/2022, 3 hours before I was supposed to board my flight they cancelled with no explanation. I’m currently here for my new flight and they have now delayed it 3 times. Horrible airline. I will never fly with them again. 22 cancelations in the last MONTH ridiculous. I was also offered $100 for my cancelled flight and have yet to receive it!! !

### "customer service was so abhorrent"
There was an accident on the freeway that caused a 2 hour delay. Didn't make my flight in time. I reached out to Allegiant and their customer service is absolutely the worst most unorganized circus I've ever encountered. Truly it's laughable. After being given 6 different numbers to call and trying to navigate their app site that wasn't working at the time; I gave up. I didn't fly with them because of the 2 hour traffic jam delay so I can't review the flight, but the customer service was so horrible that I feel I should warn people. Everyone gave me a different number to call. I will never book a flight with Allegiant again because they obviously do not train their staff to care about customers. It felt more like dealing with a fast food employee that doesn't care because they hate their job. Allegiant, the Greyhound bus of the skies. Never again. I've learned to pay more for good service. I never got on the plane. Their customer service was so abhorrent I'll never try Allegiant.

### "There is really no one you can talk to"
I had booked my brothers a flight from Nashville to McAllen on 2/25/22 for travel dates 3/24-3/27/22. While I was booking the flight the website kept glitching and trying to refresh. I finally got their tickets booked. So yesterday on 3/23/22 I pull up their itinerary to check them in and print their boarding passes, I get an error message saying it is not within the 24 hour time frame to check in. So, I immediately look at the departure date and time and realized that the departure date was incorrect. I then checked the return date and it was the same exact day 3/27/22. So the flight "I supposedly booked" was supposed to depart at 8.52am to land in McAllen at 10.55am then to get off that plane and board the next plane since it departs at 11.38am and come right back home. I tried to modify the flight to correct it. They were wanting to charge me $652 to change the date. I looked up the correct flight and realized that there were not many passengers on that flight. I called the (702) 505-8888 and waited for 5 hours and 25 minutes with no response. My phone died. I ended driving to the airport and of course there was not anyone at the desk. I sat down and tried the "chat with a live agent" option before leaving the airport. The website told me it would be a 25 minute wait. I waited for those 25 minutes and more and I got a "Null Response" whatever that meant and the screen never changed. So at this point the only chance I had to modify the itinerary was to go to the airport the morning of. We show up this morning, I immediately politely ask to speak to a manager. They said it was only a supervisor present. I explained the situation and told her I would mind to pay the difference of the tickets of what they cost today. The whole trip came out to be $338 for 4 passengers. The "supervisor" stated that she could not make any changes on her computer, that she would have to call CS. She then reiterated everything I told her. She said to make the changes they are going to charge you $780 and that's waiving the $75 modification fee. I told her I was not going to pay the $780. I was willing to pay half of $780. Why could not they catch the error, I booked the dates correctly. Had their system had not glitched we probably would not have this problem. The flight was empty! Less than 30 had booked that flight. I asked to speak to the guy on customer service, but they said I could not talk to him. I would have to call that 702 area code number. They came back and said the best they could do was for me to pay $554 after tax Which I ended up paying. There is really no one you can talk to. No one answers that customer service number they provide. The chat service is a hoax. I've read on multiple sights that they do not respond to emails. First and last time!

### "I promise its at the bottom of the barrel"
Not Verified |  Is there a zero? I've had to use them twice when the route and time I needed was only met by Allegiant. Nobody died, but otherwise ugh. Cranky staff, lost luggage, weird staffing (they close the counter to work the gate) means no service. Mind you that fits the lousy website, insane hold times, etc.. You name a service and I promise its at the bottom of the barrel.

### "the flights never took off"
I booked a round trip flight through Allegiant because they are flying the new route from Boston to Flint. On not one, but both the legs of my trip, my flights were canceled. I could say I won’t be flying with Allegiant again but, I did not even get to fly with Allegiant since the flights never took off. So, I guess it is better to say that I will not be booking with Allegiant again and I will definitely be warning friends and family not to as well. It was awful to have my flights canceled at such late notice. I needed to arrive in Michigan for a wedding in which I was a bridesmaid in. My returning flight was canceled less than an hour before take off when I was already at the airport. I had to rebook last minute flights on a different airline and of course the prices were astronomical. I had to pay $665 to pay out of pocket for my new, last minute flights when Allegiant messed up my plans and did not even provide any reasons for either cancellation.

### "Horrible way to treat customers"
We had a round flight from McAllen to Orlando. Our returning flight was delayed at first and then completely canceled. We were already inside the plane when we were informed. I tried chatting with customer service, they said they couldn't so much and disconnected the chat. I've tried calling but was placed on hold for almost 4 hours and I gave up. I've called back multiple times but Allegiants line sounds busy and disconnects. I've emailed them with no response. The people at the ticket counter could only help with certain questions. We were rebooted for Monday March 21, 2022. We were supposed to leave Friday March 18th 2022 originally. They are not making themselves responsible for hotel or transportation, or anything else due to the canceled flight. It was my first time flying with them and it will be the last. Horrible way to treat customers. Some people didn't find a returning flight till a week later. It is terrible. We are losing time from our jobs, missed appointments, etc. We understand issues happen. But they should be considerate and cover hotel and transportation costs at the very least.

### "First and last time on this carrier"
Disney weekend. Left Thursday. Supposed to return Sunday am. Flight canceled 3 am Sunday. No reschedule flight. Terrible airline. First and last time on this carrier.

### "They don't care about your children's well being"
Do not use this horrible airline. They seated my child next to strangers, breaking their own policy in doing so. When I was told to call to complain, I was on hold for over 7 hours (see screen shot) before the call finally dropped. They don't care about your children's well being. There are way better airlines to use at better airports and at the same price or cheaper so just don't.

### "Can't stress enough do not fly Allegiant"
Can't stress enough do not fly Allegiant. We sat more than 7 hours in the airport. Delay after delay. At 2.30 am finally cancelled flight. Tried giving some voucher that we couldn't use. No hotels and not one person gave a damn. While they all left to go sleep somewhere they said we could sleep on this hard floor. No place to eat if you fly evening. Was the worst experience. They get a 0/10 rating from us.

### "never fly Allegiant again"
Sitting here waiting for the plane. Please rewrite your policy on veteran’s dependents bags since you’re not going to honor it. The line was very long and they only had 1 attendant. When we finally make it to check in, my DD-214 wasnt enough for them to check my wife’s and kids bags along with mine. Their policy clearly reads that as long as we are flying on the same itinerary, dependent bags are free as well. Ask for assistance with my elderly mother in law. Was told someone would come get her, they never did. Luckily a TSA agent seen us struggling and offer to help. He even told us how terrible Allegiant’s service is! Will never fly Allegiant again, so beware of the lower fare because their service is terrible.

### "I have spent hours and hours on the phone"
Not Verified |  Unbelievable that they cancel days before flight. You can't change anything online, it all has to be done through Allegiant. I have spent hours and hours on the phone and still haven't talked to anyone.

### "their services will be a test to your patience"
Not Verified |  Allegiant Air is always consistently inconsistent and a headache. If you fly with this airline, make sure you allocate more than enough “spare time” into your traveling schedule. Nothing they do is quick and their services will be a test to your patience. I would much rather pay more money for more organization.

### "Save yourself the headache and money"
This company is despicable. We purchased a flight and rental car. My husband was flying out of Vegas and due to misinformation by security guards he wound up missing his flight. We tried calling the customer care number and I was told that my hold time would be 2 hours. I guess they meant 2 times 3 because I spent 6 hours on hold trying to pay the $75 rescheduling fee. We wound up getting him a flight on another airline to Nashville for today. We spoke with Alamo and they said the rental was good for 24 hours so if he made it to Knoxville he could still use that portion of the trip. He drove from Nashville and was told to speak with someone at the airline. The ticket agent finally got someone on the phone from customer care and he said the car was forfeited by missing the flight and although he can pay $75 to reschedule the flight he can’t reschedule the care. Are you serious? It was purchased as a package but can now be divided to keep money. The car was more than the ticket and that’s what we cared about at this point. Now he has to rent another car for a week. Not to mention the day he wants to fly back (3/24) home they don’t have service, so now he’s out of $977.00, a new rental car fee and possibly 3 nights of unplanned hotel stays because they can’t get him on a flight until 3/27. These people suck as a company and it’s insane that they actually are still in business. We’ll definitely never use this airline again. Save yourself the headache and money.

### "They didn’t even care"
They canceled the flight with an option only to reschedule two days later. The customer service representative had no empathy. They didn’t even care when I stated that this was a bad experience. Also, I had to call 10 times and stay on the line for 2 hours to get a response.

### "Terrible first experience with Allegiant Air"
Not Verified |  Terrible first experience with Allegiant Air. First flight was delayed twice so we arrived two hours late at our destination. Return fight delayed 3 times then canceled. Our options were to reschedule flight or get a refund. The next flight was not for 3 days so we opted for a refund. That was a joke as they offered 1/4 of the original price. The new airline does not fly into our original airport where our car was so we had to figure that out as well. What a way to treat you customers Allegiant.

### "Worse airline I've ever been on"
Worse airline I've ever been on. We have been sitting in these uncomfortable seats for 3 hours, because they needed gas now maintenance issues. The only thing they offered us was 1/2 glass of water and a tiny bag of pretzels.

### "A shameful disgrace of a company"
Canceled scheduled flight- the next available flight was three days later. Contact center rang busy for 2 days forcing us to schedule another carrier. Website showed only one available seat and we needed two so could not re-book online. Finally got on hold on third day, over two hours on hold. They got us on the plane but offered no reimbursement or even flight credit. Just $22 in vouchers for 2 days of hotels, food, and $200 in cancel fees on the alternate carrier- cost us well over $1000 total. To not have anyone available at the contact center or the website accurate/ functional for two plus days is beyond unacceptable. A shameful disgrace of a company.

### "What a mess!"
Not Verified |  Will never use this airline again! Flight delayed 2 hours when our Florida vacation started, then when we left Florida a week later flight was delayed 3 times! When we finally boarded wee sat on the plane an additional 45 min then they made us all get off the plane? Mechanical issues? No explanation! After everyone got off with their luggage the flight was cancelled! Everyone to receive $300 voucher but we then had to rent a car and stay another night in a hotel! What a mess! Will never use this airline again

### "The flight attendants were nothing but rude"
By far the worst airline, honestly they should be shut down. Flight got delayed from 3pm to 4pm then after getting to the airport they over booked the flight by 1 person so they were delayed for another 30 minutes so they could kick someone off. Finally we board and sit there for over an hour and a half because they were having “mechanical issues” which they have every flight. We then get told to deboard the plane and switch planes. After we had to sit for another hour and was scheduled to get to Albany at 10 pm when we were originally supposed to get home at 5.45. The flight was so uncomfortable and the pilot clearly had no clue how to take off a runway. The flight attendants were nothing but rude probably because they work for the worst airline. Last time I flew through them in August they made us sit on the plane for 3 hours for again “mechanical issues”. Maybe if you have this many mechanical issues you should just not be an airline.

### "not an airline, it is a circus"
Not Verified |  This is not an airline, it is a circus. They drop a bunch of flights at one time leaving you stranded. Was in the airport 2 hours early going on vacation and a text comes across that they flat out canceled the trip. Not a lot of choices at this point to get out of Appleton to meet my family. Just stranded. Phone number is busy and website barely works when they drop them. Low and behold my brother reluctantly booked with them and they did the same for his Spring Break trip. A joke and travel at your own risk plus be prepared to maybe be stranded a couple days or have the funds to get booked on a much higher fee. I was in the airline industry for 8 years and this one plus its cousins are a crap shoot at best.

### "still no word from Allegiant"
Key West to Nashville. Trust me. Book with any other “airline”. Was notified via the Allegiant app our flight home was cancelled a couple hours from departure. Tried every phone number I could find for Allegiant for hours. You either get a busy signal or put on hold for hours with no answer. Commuted to the airport to find all Allegiant staff had left already and would not return. Other customers and airport staff suggested to rent a vehicle and drive to Miami or Ft. Lauderdale to find a flight home. 48hrs and 2500$+ later still no word from Allegiant. Still unable to reach them via phone, chat or email. Praise the AA agent for finding us a flight the next night when no flights were showing for the next two days with anyone. We will never fly with Allegiant again. You shouldn’t either.

### "a message that flight was cancelled"
Not Verified |  I bought roundtrip ticket from Austin TX to Fayettville, Arkansas. I was supposed to fly back tonight 3/14/22. I received a message that flight was cancelled. They don't have anymore flights to my destination until 4 days from now. Tickets in other airlines will cost me between 500-700 one way to return home. Allegiant gave me the option at no cost to fly back with them 4 days from now. I chose that option, had to pay for a seat. I tried cancelling flight and I can not speak to anyone. Ticket cost about $300 and t hey were only going to refund 48 minus the seat option. I cannot even get that refund since its impossible to speak to someone.

### "I just want to be done with them"
Not Verified |  Flight cancelled with no explanation while I was in the middle of my 2 hour drive to the airport. I was already using a voucher for a big spring break trip with my son. The vouchers are set to expire in June. Had to rebook last minute on another airline for twice what the entire trip with hotel and Vegas concert tickets cost previously. At this point, Allegiant cancelled more flights with me than completed. I wish they’d just reimburse me the value of the voucher and I’d walk away. Heck, pay a discount value for the voucher. I just want to be done with them, but the voucher value is significant.

### "There is no way I'd fly with this airline again"
Not a good experience! The flight out was just fine. However, the flight home got canceled the day of just hours before I was supposed to start heading to the airport, tried to book an alternate flight on app, it froze, went to airline desk for assistance, attendant told us flight was full, stepped to the side and booked seats on website on my phone since app was not working, went back to the same attendant and told her we booked our flight and needed our boarding passes. Then we had to fly into the middle of nowhere (Huntington WV) just to get close to home, get a taxi, stay overnight in a hotel, and book a rental car that wouldn't be available until the next morning to get the rest of the way home, ALL of which I had to pay for myself. Pretty pathetic my phone was more useful in booking a flight than the desk computer at the airport. Spent more time and money trying to get home because of this experience than it would have cost to just book a different commercial flight through another, more reliable airline. I also had to find a coworker to cover my shift I will now be missing in my efforts to just go home, as well as emergently asking our pet sitter to stay another night. There is no way I'd fly with this airline again unless I truly had no choice, and there is no way I'd recommend this airline to anyone unless they love unexpected "adventures " and have unlimited funds to dig their way out of it. Can't wait to see my credit card statement after all this nonsense!

### "livid, appalled and extremely upset"
Worst Airline of all airlines for sure, no wonder they're so cheap it’s like buying a great value brand product with this airline. Don’t expect them to be punctual, my flight has been canceled twice to go home in the last two days. So I left Greensboro to go to Florida and visit my family for spring break I flew Allegiant like I usually do had no problems flying here on my way back home to fly got to the airport which was 2 hours away only to find out an hour later my flight got canceled. I guess the weather was perfectly fine in Greensboro and Florida but maybe there was weather issues in route towards Greensboro - they never gave me a reason to as to why it got canceled. The people at the desks weren’t very helpful in this situation and couldn’t afford another flight back so I booked another flight home on Sunday with them. I waited to Sunday, drove to the airport and 2 hours into my drive there I get a notification my flight has been canceled again - at this point I just want my money back as I’m not flying with them again. I’m not taking a chance that they’ll cancel my flight again so I try to get a refund on the app, it says error, I have to call customer service. I call customer service and every time I try to call the call disconnects. I can’t get a hold of anyone I’ve missed out on work and school over this. I just wish I could get a reason as to why they keep canceling flights. I just want a justifiable reason and they can’t even give that to me. Come to find out my buddy is also flying Allegiant on the same day a couple hours later to Virginia out of Florida, Virginia is very close to where I was supposed to be flying to and are flights are scheduled only a couple hours apart - his flight doesn’t get delayed or cancelled his flying the same route almost and almost around the same time but his doesn’t get canceled. I’m livid, appalled and extremely upset. I can’t believe or understand as to why this has happened to me twice. .

### "appalled at your customer service"
Not Verified |  I am appalled at your customer service! I sent you several emails telling you of my having to cancel my trip with Allegiant because the flight schedule did not work with the sudden challenges I was dealing with in the rapidly deteriorating health condition of my Mother. I received emails back telling me what to do, calling CS if I was within 72 hours of my scheduled departure. I complied with what was asked and was repeatedly told that my wait time was at least 2 hours. However, if I was to call back between 9pm and 4am I would be able to talk to a customer service agent. On the 8th of March, I did just that, calling at 12:15am and waited on hold until 2:30am, well past 2 hours, hanging up, never having talked to a CS agent. Allegiant misrepresented CS options to me. I did look at the FAQs and found that Allegiant does not offer a bereavement refund for a scheduled flight. In addition, Allegiant wanted proof that I was making that claim. Is Allegiant that insensitive? Basically, Allegiant’s inept & insensitive customer service policies cost me $166! I do have a choice in what Airlines I use for travel. I will NEVER choose to use Allegiant again! Allegiant can try to be the most low-cost airline available, but if Allegiant treats other customers like Allegiant treated me, Allegiant will not have any customers to fly.

### "worst travel experience I have ever had"
Not Verified |  Safe to say Allegiant Air is the worst travel experience I have ever had. They are made up of the most incompetent staff I have witnessed and are as helpful as a pile of bricks. They canceled my original flight at midnight and told all passengers that they would not be helping us rebook or reschedule, and that we would have to go on the app and do it all by ourselves. I had to scramble to pay $830 for a new flight 2 days later. I also called their customer service over 60 times in one day about getting a refund (also sent two emails) and have yet to hear back. My new flight has now been pushed back five hours and there isn’t a staff member in sight to answer any questions or help anyone. These people should all be fired immediately!

### "Cut Rate Airline with Cut Rate Service"
Not Verified |  Cut Rate Airline with Cut Rate Service. Is it really worth the small savings? Cancelled our flight last minute without providing a back up or a reason. Left our party of four without transportation to our vacation. Prepaid for our condo, car rental, 24 rounds of golf (4 people times 6 rounds) and the cut-rate airline. Not sure how this will turn out. Flew Allegiant two weeks prior to Punta Gorda. The return flight was utter chaos trying to check in with hundreds of other passengers at the same time. Lines went throughout the airport and ended by the baggage claim. Apparently, they booked several flights to take off around the same time (Rookie Mistake and Poor Management). My wife has had it with this outfit and will not do business with them again and will cancel their credit card. What an extremely poor run operation with no attention to the customer. Do yourself a favor and use any other airline.

### "I will never fly them again"
Worst experience ever. I was scheduled for a 11am departure and received a text alert at 8am the flight was delayed to a 2pm departure. We had already crossed the border into Buffalo so stayed in the general area burning time at a nearby store shopping and were going to head to airport for noon; 2 hours before the revised flight departure. At 10:55am, I received another text that the flight had been moved up to depart at 12pm, literally 1h5m from the time the text was sent. We rushed to the airport and were in the line to check in bags within 10 min of this time. At exactly 1115pm the single person working behind the counter announced they would not check in any more bags even though myself and at least 40 other people were still in the line. From the time they sent the text with the new departure time to when she announced the cutoff, it was not physically possible to check in all the people there. Things just got insane from there with everyone screaming, people taking full luggage through security. The one person working just screamed at everyone they should have been there earlier despite all the revised departure notifications. The manager was apparently hiding upstairs and would not come down to help. I have never seen before where they delay a flight by 3 hours and then bump it back up by 2 hours with 20 minutes notice! The flight ended up leaving an hour late with half the passengers, everyone very angry and many stranded. This was completely avoidable situation if it had been managed properly and passengers were given more than 20 minues notice of the earlier times. I will never fly them again

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. Cancelled flight after putting bags on plane. Cancelled all flights on their airlines from Nashville to all over. Seemed for no reason. Weather was fine. Then we waited an hour after cancellation for the bags to get off the plane. They lost my husbands suitcase. How can they lose it, when we never had lift off? They did! We have to eat $5,500 of our hotel cost. All other airlines are booked since it’s spring break, including future flights on Allegiant this week.

### "We now have a 12 hour drive tomorrow"
Not Verified |  Allegiant cancelled our spring break flight to Destin yesterday - the day before the flight. No reason given. There are no options to fly other airlines. We now have a 12 hour drive tomorrow. Never will I book again with Allegiant.

### "never choose Allegiant Air again"
Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. I never expect a lot from Allegiant Air because they are one of the cheaper airlines but come on Allegiant. After receiving news Saturday morning that my grandpa passed away that morning, my siblings and I immediately look for flights to be with our family in jersey. We chose Frontier to get there from Florida. That flight was perfect, no issues. The reason we decided to take Allegiant for our flight back was because my older brother was already there and we wanted to fly back together. We originally got our flight back for Tuesday. After being with our family for Sunday and Monday we realized the funeral was going to be on Wednesday and we needed to be there for that. We call Allegiant and after waiting 1 hour to speak to a representative we were told they could get us flights for $230. So our flight home in total for all of us ended up being $800. Which was $600 more than what we paid for our flights to begin with. My sister asks if there is anything else they can do due to it being a death in our immediate family and funeral arrangements being made, we were told In this terrible time we should have chosen the flight protection and that she was doing this as a courtesy. Charging us $230 more than our original ticket. We will never choose Allegiant Air again.

### "Stress I did not need!"
My flight was canceled with no explanation 3 hours prior to boarding. No assistance with rebooking. 1 hour and 45 minute hold time on the card holder Concierge line (no benefit there). Refund will take 3 days and they canceled my return flight without verifying. I had to rebook at a higher price. Booked a next day last minute flight on a competitor (Southwest) at double my initial cost. Work has already been missed a day and a half was missed with family but will hopefully get to Florida in time for a Sunday memorial service. Definitely not VIP treatment! Stress I did not need!

### "what a complete waste of our time"
Absolutely the worst airline. Had seasonal weather and plane sat on ground overnight. Flight was scheduled for 3pm. Instead of checking the plane before hand they wait until everyone is boarded and then have issues. We sat on the plane for 3.5 hours before we could take off - unacceptable. The return flight has already been delayed 5 hours, what a complete waste of our time.

### "No compensation, no flights"
Allegiant not only canceled one of our flights with no reasoning given. They turned around and put us on a different flight leaving out of Tulsa and by the time we got to Oklahoma canceled that flight as well with no compensation. They told me allegedly they canceled due to weather but since I was already in Tulsa there was no weather. No compensation, no flights in a ruined spring break trip is all I got from Allegiant.

### "Do not book with this airline!"
Not Verified |  Do not book with this airline! I booked a flight close to a month in advance and 6 hours before the plane was supposed to depart, the flight got canceled. I received a refund for my ticket but no refund for the 35$ processing fee they charged me. Similar things have happened in the past according my friends who have also flown this airline. The website did not give me the option to book another flight (the option was greyed out) and when I called customer support it went to voicemail (at 3.00pm on a Thursday). I ended up having to book a flight with Spirit Airlines for the next day. I think Allegiant should cover the cost difference.

### "never attempt to fly Allegiant again"
Not Verified |  I'm so upset with this airline. Our flights were canceled a week and a half prior to flying out for a memorial service. Because it's last minute I now have to find a flight for $500-$1000 to get to my destination on time for the service. I will never attempt to fly Allegiant again. It would have been nice if we had more notice so we could attempt to get cheaper flights on another airline. I've tried calling several times this morning and all I get is a busy signal.

### "horrible experience and money grabbing"
I'm a disabled veteran who recently separated and hasn't been home to see my family much at all in the past decade. I booked a weekend flight home for some much needed quality time with my loved ones and to see my dying grandfather before he passes. They canceled the flight while I was standing in line to check my bags at 930 PM. I called to get another flight home after being refunded the next week but there is nothing they can do since it was after 72 hours. The flights for the next few months are much more expensive then the flight I was scheduled to go on. I called and just wanted to pay my original fair for the amount I was suppose to fly out that day. I don't think thats too unreasonable. Now I have to buy another set of tickets that cost much more than the original and take more days off of work. This is costing me more than I would have spent not to mention a much greater hassle. Thanks Allegiant for the horrible experience and money grabbing.

### "pay the money to book a real airline"
I shouldn’t have expected much on a flight with Allegiant Air. Low expectations but even lower delivery. Try boarding half the flight before realizing one of your flight crew missed their flight to the airport. Or leaving 2 hours late because nobody in your company communicated with each other. Honestly- just pay the money to book a real airline. The anxiety of wondering if you will even make it home from your trip, and realizing you are more stressed than when you left on your 3 day vacation isn’t worth it. Don’t book Allegiant.

### "Worst experience ever with an airline"
Not Verified |  Worst experience ever with an airline. Flight was originally planned to leave at 2.11, was delayed until 2.45. The plane didn’t get to the gate until 2, from there we waited an hour to board the plane. After boarding the plane we waited two hours because they were conducting maintenance on the plane. After two hours of sitting on the flight, we were told to get off the flight and we were delayed again for another two hours.

### "I will never fly with them again"
We waited at airport from 1500 to 0100 just to be told our flight was canceled. We couldn’t book another flight because they kept saying our flight will go out tonight. We waited until 0100 and was told then it was canceled. We couldn’t book another flight until next day. Lost out on $1600 fishing trip and a $200 night at hotel in which none was refundable. The airline manager at the gate told us she could get us a hotel so promised 350 dollars for this event. After waiting and waiting only received $175 dollars. I took a video of the Manager stating all of this and they still will not honor what they said they would. I will never fly with them again unless I see come customer services in which is honorable.

### "90 minutes to get checked baggage"
Not Verified |  Waited over 90 minutes to get checked baggage. Eventually realized they are such a terrible company they waited for another flight to get in over an hour later and bundled the checked bags from both flights together forcing my flight to wait 90 min for their bags. Completely unacceptable.

### "canceled the morning of travel"
Not Verified |  Bought round trip ticket from PIE to Key West and back. The trip to Key West was fine. However the flight back was canceled the morning of travel without explanation. Although we received a refund for the canceled leg but doesn't help much when you have to scramble to get another flight/ airline in that day. Same thing happened two weeks later for friends visiting from Kansas to St. Petersburg Florida. Return to canceled by carrier without explanation. Terrible airline

### "on hold for 5 hours and never got through"
Not Verified |  I had two items I needed to speak with a customer service professional on - the first being a refund for paying for checked bags then learning checked bags are free for veterans - I wanted to see about getting a refund. The second item was the fact that my husband's TSA Precheck was not on his boarding pass although mine was. I called several times and after being on hold for hours I was never able to get through. On top of that, a friend I was traveling with had a critical issue (she could not check into the hotel which was reserved through Alliant) and she was on hold for 5 hours and never got through. This is completely and utterly ridiculous!

### "I never received any replies!"
Not Verified |  Needed to cancel the flights due to a death in the family. Tried canceling online, the site was down. Tried again the next day, when I clicked the cancel flight, was prompted to call. Upon calling the number several times over the next 4 days...got recording "Due to high call volumes, we are not taking any calls right now. Found another number on google for Allegiant, just kept going to a busy signal. Tried to use the online chat agent, said no agent available at this time. (Tried several different times). Last option for contact was to use the email link, I have sent 2 emails and received no response. Can't even say it was poor customer service, because I never received any replies!

### "The attendants watched and stood watching without any help!"
Not Verified |  Until the end of the flight I was going to give a 10 out of out of 5 stars, I would give 5 stars because the flight attendants were very helpful and friendly helping people in the front row place their carry-on over head because the front row was not able to use the 1st 2 storage areas because the crew uses them and they made sure the 3 set of storage was for the first row. The were kind and friendly throughout the flight. Until the end of the flight! Once we landed I asked the 2 flight attendants directly sitting facing us "are we going to be able to get out carry on items before everyone behind us rushes up to the front to get off the plane? The attendants stated "sometimes it works but it’s a free for all. Let the free for all begin! It was very uncomfortable because people behind us were rude and stood in the aisle and didn’t care that we needed to get our carry-on items out before we could leave since the flight attendants didn’t want to work any longer or help any longer my husband assisted the 2 elderly men sitting in the front row on the other side to get their carry inside while the people behind us made it difficult! The attendants watched and stood watching without any help! Very inappropriate! Allegiant could of had a great review and the attendants destroyed it at the end!

### "No regard for the customer whatsoever"
Not Verified |  I agree with all the negative reviews for Allegiant Air. Looks like the flights are cheap until you add all the “extras”. Everything is extra including seat selection. My biggest complaint however is their Customer Service. Tried to find out why my rescheduled flight cost me $300+ each for person by calling Customer Service. We called 3 times and each time waited over 3 hours for someone to answer phone. Each time we finally hung up. Who ever heard of a 3+ hour wait to speak to a person. What a joke. No regard for the customer whatsoever. Flying with this airline is not worth the aggravation. You may pay slightly more going with a more reputable airline but it would be worth the extra money.

### "We had to fly out on an American flight the next day"
I will never fly with Allegiant again. Our flight was delayed 15+ hours with the gate agents always telling us it would leave in 45min. Eventually the flight was cancelled and the gate agents very clearly stated what we would receive for compensation of which I took a video of for proof. We had to fly out on an American flight the next day at our own expense and still have not received the compensation which they promised. Customer service says there is nothing they can do (spent countless hours on hold). This airline is full of crooks, liars and thieves.

### "will never fly Allegiant again"
Not Verified |  Horrible airline. Avoid at all costs. Prices look cheap but they are listed with no carryon, no checked bag, no seat assignment. After adding everything up a regular airline is about the same. Seats are hard plastic and don't move. Customer service is horrible. Was on hold for 30 minutes after they reassigned our seats to ones I didn't want. They would not change to an aisle seat like I had before they reassigned me because it cost $1 more. I offered to pay $1 but customer service rep said no - she was horrible - will never fly Allegiant again.

### "company has lost all reliability"
I’ve flown Allegiant for years. I’ll never fly with them again. It’s worth the extra $100 to know that your flight won’t be cancelled with our accommodation and to know that when you get on the flight it’s going to leave less than an hour late. This company has lost all reliability.

### "Worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service I’ve ever encountered. I will never book with this airline again. I tried every method to get hold of this airline. Live chat (wasn’t working), email (never received a response), phone call (waited on hold for 5 hours and finally gave up). Their policy states you get a refund if you rebook due to weather advisory but I have yet to receive one. And the up charges on your flight are insane. But the customer service is what it the most appalling. There is NO way to get a response. Maybe if I’d stayed on hold for another 5 hours? At the very least they could offer the call back service other airlines provide so you don't waste hours listening the same recording over and over every 10 seconds. Do yourself a favor and never book with this awful airline— you end up paying more in the end and they don’t give a damn about their customers.

### "Very frustrating"
Not Verified |  Waited on runway 45 minutes to deplane. Been in baggage claim 1 hour and 20 minutes, no clue where the luggage is, could be a while. Excuse is short staffed, well no problem booking my ticket and taking my money but can't get my luggage into the terminal. Very frustrating. Staff absent, no one to answer questions. Just want to get out of the airport!

### "I will never fly this airline again"
I have never had so much trouble with this airline. They delay my flight 4 hours and then cancelled it. I wanted to try and reschedule this flight, but every time I called, they hung up on me. I will never fly this airline again.

### "Cancelled our flight with no apology"
Worse airline in the world! Ruined our Disneyland trip. Cancelled our flight with no apology, and we had to find a 15 passenger van to take our grandchildren to Disneyland. Kids were in their carseats for 12 hours. I tried calling to make sure they would at least keep the return flights and our children and grandchildren would flight back and we would drive the van alone back to Salt Lake, but after a two-hour hold, they did not answer the phone. They should be forced to close their business. They are careless about their clients, rude, and they do not respect anyone. They break every possible rule.

### "Not worth the hassle dealing with them"
Not Verified |  Our flight from Flint to Punta Gorda was unable to land in Punta Gorda. Plane was changed to land in Stanford Orlando. Children without adults traveling to grandparents were not given help 250 miles from Punta Gorda original destination where grandparents were waiting to pick them up. Senior need assistance were left with no help. We had to drive 259 mile each way to get our family. Then they would not give us our luggage, and told us we had to pick it up at Punta Gorda the next day but wouldn't give a time. Tried calling Allegiant to see when it came in. Might just a well call the moon. Not worth the hassle dealing with them.

### "taking advantage of budget travelers"
My parents were supposed to fly out of St. Petersburg Airport at 6:45 PM. They began getting 4 delays and finally were set to fly out at 9:45 PM. AT 6:00 they cancelled the flight with no other flights leaving until Monday (3 days later). My parents would have to spend another 450.00 in lodging to stay until Monday and their dog sitter could not stay any more days. My dad had to pay another 150.00 that he doesn't have to stay the night and I had to spend 800 to pay the difference to get them flights out of Tampa. I was on hold with Allegiant for 4 hours and they never picked up the phone. There was no weather and no reason given for delay. They are predatory and make a business out of taking advantage of budget travelers.

### "A very poor customer service"
I have flown with Allegiant Air many times in the past, but this was my last time I will fly them. The last four times I have flown with Allegiant Air the flight either got canceled or delayed by more than five hours. This last trip was the last straw. I had 2 major issues this last time and I will highlight them below. 1. I am legally blind so I require extra help getting where I need to go. For the most part a family member or friend that takes me to the airport gets me to my gate and at least gets me in line to point me in the right direction. I was sitting in the gate area with my grandmother and was basically denied service. My grandmother walked up to the Gate counter and asked the gate agent when we started boarding if someone would just walk me to my seat. The man at the desk said and I quote “you need to stay with him. We are short staffed right now and since he’s not in a wheelchair he is considered lower priority“. So  just because I’m not in a wheelchair means that my disability isn’t credible enough for you to care. Eventually a gracious passenger who was sitting next to me in the gate area offered to help me. Speaks a lot of volumes when the people getting paid to do this stuff can’t even do their jobs. The flight was delayed by four hours which I understand does happen and it’s out of the control of allegiance staff. Where I take issue is when we get literally zero updates about what is going on. My 84-year-old grandfather picking me up in Greenville had to sit there for over two hours because he had no idea when I was getting in and I could only give him updates when I received them. A very poor customer service. In conclusion this is one of the worst airlines I’ve ever flown. If you can avoid it please do so and save yourself the trouble.

### "Horrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Horrible customer service. My return flight was cancelled less than an hour before take off. Waited in a massive line at the ticket counter only to be told there was nothing they could do. So many people were upset, the police were called to the counter. I was not offered a voucher to fly another airline, I had to find a hotel for the night and fly out the next day on a different airline which I had to pay out of pocket, plus I had to miss a day of work because of the delay. What's worse is that I never received a refund for the flight! Customer service is rude and uncaring about the havoc they cause. Never again will I be suckered into another trip with them.

### "never going to fly with them again"
They canceled my flight the day of while I’m at the airport. I called customer service and they promised me the world saying I can reschedule my flight, I’ll get a cash voucher for another flight, I’ll get a cash reward for all the hotel in trouble I had. I didn’t get a single thing the customer service has you on hold for 2 to 3 hours they tell you that there’s nothing that they can do it’s a different department anytime you need help whatever they promise you is a lie they don’t give you anything they promise they just want you off the phone worst customer service ever I have never taken my flight. That was four months ago. I haven’t gotten a refund on the ticket that I did purchase even though they canceled it I didn’t get the cash reward that they offered because I had to cancel my hotel and rental car. I also didn’t get an extra airline voucher for a ticket. Whatever you do don’t fly with them you will get nothing in return. And it’s sad because I had their credit card and it’s the only airline that I’ve flown for the last two years 30 or 40 trips and now I’m canceling the credit card and never going to fly with them again over one flight.

### "Absolute horrific mess"
Not Verified |  Absolute horrific mess. No options once your flight is cancelled when they only fly 1 time and 1 day! Tried 4 different airports. Never again. Wouldn't consider even if it was free. They cancel flights when all the other airlines are flying circles around them.

### "Lousy way to run a business"
Not Verified | Provo to Santa Ana. Our return flight was cancelled and we had to scramble to find a flight home with another airline. This cost us a lot of money and a lot of stress! Also, we were only given about one fourth of what we should have received! My family will never fly Allegiant Air again. Lousy way to run a business.

### "cancelled within a couple hours of takeoff"
Horrible what they did to us. The airline cancelled within a couple hours of takeoff. We had to fly with other airlines the following day for triple our previous paid flight. We had to get a room for my wife and our two daughters, food, car rental, fuel, we all lost a day of work, and the airline ticket counter said it was because the airlines was short staffed due to COVID. They said they would refund us, and we would have that refund within 72 hours. 5 days later no refund and another $2,495.00 in cost for the trip. When I finally called them for our refund, they said it was due to weather. No benefits because it was an act of "God. However, if you cancel a flight in less than 24 hours there is a $75.00 per person/ticket fee. They don't pay that same fee to you as a customer, you're just screwed. NO alternate flights. No nothing. If they were kind enough to do anything for us at all we wouldn't be this upset. I hate writing a review on some business. This hurts to no end.

### "Cheap flight means cheap customer service"
When flying back home from Arizona our flight hovered over the airport in Provo then turned us around and sent us back to Arizona. Canceled all departing flights for the rest of the day and had one girl working the help desk. Poor girl had to cover 2 canceled flights by herself and couldn't even get ahold of Allegiant customer support herself. Waited in line for 2 hours to write my name on a piece of paper to get a full refund. Had to call allegiant a week later to actually start the refund process. Told me I would receive the refund in 7-10 days. Well it has been a month now and I have not received my refund. I have sent emails, tried their online messaging, as well as wait on hold for 2+ hours. I am out a lot of money due to that one trip because I had to hurry and book a one way flight home with another airline the day after the 26th. The flight crew was great and super helpful but as for their customer service line it is crap. A month later no refund and I have tried calling everyday for the past 2 weeks but it is constantly a 2+ hour wait to speak with someone. I guess you get what you pay for. Cheap flight means cheap customer service.

### "frustration and discomfort"
Not Verified | Worst experience with an airline. We were supposed to leave at 3:30 pm. It is 6:17pm. TNow we are leaving the gate. The frustration and discomfort in these hard seats isn't worth saving a few bucks. On the positive the flight attendants and captain, were professional and nice.

### "Allegiant doesn’t have what it takes to be an airline"
These clowns don’t even deserve a review, hopefully I can save someone the trouble of dealing with absolute idiots. Two of us purchased tickets to fly out Monday evening non-stop to Las Vegas for an 8 am class on Tuesday, at the world of concrete convention. We got an email two hours before departure that said our flight was cancelled. I called the phone number on the email and asked why it was canceled, the guy said it was because they didn’t have a crew available. We ended up having to drive 7 hours to Denver and catch a 6.30 flight. We were exhausted and also late to the class. Allegiant doesn’t have what it takes to be an airline. I won’t waste my time looking at there ticket prices in the future and sure hope nobody else does either.

### "money you save is not worth the headache"
Not Verified | This review is for my adult daughter, who I bought a ticket for her and her boyfriend to travel from Spokane, WA. to Las Vegas, NV on Jan. 13, 2022. 45 minutes prior to departing, the flight got cancelled due to "weather". My daughter asked the gate agent why other airlines were taking off and if the agent would re-book her with another airlines. The gate agent told her that the weather caused the flight to be cancelled and it was not her job to re-book her onto another airlines. I was on the phone with my daughter when all this took place, even though she's an adult (20), she doesn't have much experience dealing with this and I was trying to help her. I was appalled by the customer service this gate agent was giving to my daughter and hearing her deal with other customers in the area. She lacked professionalism, courtesy, intelligence and patience. My daughter then took a picture of the weather 30 minutes prior to departure and the weather was clear and the sun was shining and, still, other planes were taking off. The money you save is not worth the headache in dealing with this airlines. You have been warned.

### "airline cares more about the profits"
On January 14, I flew Allegiant Air from Mesa Gateway to South Bend International Airport. Prior to the flight leaving; they advised quite a few passengers that there was a change in seating. I paid for a window seat in the back of the plane. However, they changed it to an Exit row in the middle of the plane. I advised the flight attendant of the situation and that I paid for a window seat. She said the plane was absolutely full and no arrangements could be changed. She said that I should be happy that I have extra leg room. In any case, when I sat down, the gentlemen that they put me next to was very rude. He was a larger man and wasn’t budging on room. It made it very uncomfortable for room. It was just disappointing that this airline cares more about the profits than they do the customers.

### "Worst customer service ever"
Bundled my rental car with my flight. Allegiant cancelled the flight due to "staff shortages" but refuses to refund my missed rental car. Worst customer service ever.

### "worst experience I have had flying"
I woke up this morning at 4 AM to get to the airport to deal with rude service desk people and to be told my flight was canceled. I was stranded in Florida for over 14 hours. I was suppose to fly out and be home by 10:30. I had to fly to another airport where my vehicle was not at, so I had to find a ride there and pay extra parking fees on top of what I had already paid. I had to pay 100$ in Uber fees so I could eat and not have to starve due to not being allowed to check a bag, find someone to keep my child while I was stuck in Florida, pay extra for my hotel to allow me to stay longer. This was the worst experience I have had flying.

### "I will never be using Allegiant again"
Allegiant is the worst airline ever. Booked a flight and with only two days till my departure they canceled my return flight. I rebooked twice and those were also canceled. They refused to book me with another airline for my return and said they could give no compensation other than a flight voucher. I had to scramble last minute to find another flight. The customer service people are not helpful in any way. Was hung up on the first time that I called after expressing my frustration. I will never be using Allegiant again.

### "If you don't mind missing your trip, this may be the airline for you"
They cancelled this flight due to fog, but no other airlines cancelled. If you don't mind missing your trip, this may be the airline for you. Not worth the stress of trying to rebook along with all the other passengers looking to get on another flight and missing a whole day of your planned trip. They didn't sell enough tickets is my suspected reason they actually cancelled. Leave their customers hanging with only other airlines to book with too.

### "Terrible Customer Service"
Terrible Customer Service from 1 agent in particular. She actually hung up the call rather than listening to the customer complaint and appropriately responding/sharing feedback. She belittled the customer and did not provide courteous feedback. She let me know she made a note that we spoke to her on the account but refused to allow me to give any feedback over the phone that she could proactive relay to the team. Let me add that I was chatting with this individual after being on hold for 4 hours and after a 2 hour delay on 1/9/2022 on Flight 712.

### "I will never fly with them again"
Allegiant flew my family to Orlando but on Friday Dec 31 at 5 pm cancelled our return flight on Jan 2. It was not due to weather. No return flight was offered until jan 5. We had no hotel after jan2, no rental car, my husband & 1 would have lost wages starting from jan 3. We had to get a 1way rental car and leave Orlando on new years eve and start driving the 18.5 hours back to Michigan at an additional fee of almost $1000. Not to mention the additional fee of gas used, a hotel for 1 night. We also couldn't use our remaining theme park tickets, left our previously rented condo 2 nights early, and had bought food we had to throw away. Allegiant only reimbursed us for our cancelled flight. Nothing else. They stranded us 1200 miles from home and said only "sorry for the inconvenience". It was terrible. I will never fly with them again.

### "it's worse than I could have ever imagined"
Not Verified |  I am disgusted by this airline. They are literally incompetent and do not care at all about their passengers. I had a flight scheduled from Vegas to Spokane that was canceled less than forty eight hours in advance. I did understand this, since many flights are being canceled due to COVID. However, this airline has been unbelievably unhelpful since my flight was canceled. I originally waited on the phone for more than an hour and a half to get in contact with a customer service representative to see if there was any way they could help me rebook my flight or provide compensation, as every flight is obviously significantly more expensive now than when I booked my flight on Allegiant several months ago. As this airline barely goes anywhere and has no relationship with any other airlines, they provided no way for me to get to my destination and did not seem to care at all that I'm now stuck without a way back to school. The airline did provide a small voucher for having to cancel the flight last minute but the voucher did not work, saying that my intended method of receiving the voucher was not working. I am counting on this voucher to help purchase another flight but am unable to get in contact with anyone from this garbage airline. The call wait time is scheduled for more than three hours, I received an automated response to my email saying that it would take upwards of a week to respond and that I needed to call instead. The online chat is unavailable. I thought I knew what I was getting myself into by booking Allegiant, but it's worse than I could have ever imagined. I don't care how big of a savings it is, nothing is worth the headache of this airline.

### "Horrible way to treat customers"
Not Verified |  Allegiant is the worst airline out there, and that's saying a lot because airlines these days are pretty horrible. They offer a very competitive flight rate and no frills. My husband booked a flight to Las Vegas, they changed his flight there from night to morning, so he had to miss a day of work and then they just cancelled his flight home, no reschedule. They refunded the ticket and then gave a $150 check to get another flight home on another airline. This would have been fine, but all the other airlines were way over this amount. Because it was cancelled 2 days before the flight, the prices for flights to get back home were mostly over $500! I called Allegiant to ask how $150 was supposed to get him home and their answer was that it was nice of them to give the $150 and basically we have to pay the rest out of pocket. So either we pay the remaining amount, or my husband lives in Las Vegas now. We will never fly Allegiant again, and will discourage anyone from ever flying with them, even though they were so kind to give us a voucher for another flight with them in the future. Horrible way to treat customers. Don't risk getting stuck and hung out to dry by this company.

### "This is bad bad service"
Not Verified | We left Cincinnati Airport going to st. Pete Florida 12/30/21 until 1/2/22. We had a party of four. When we landed in St. Pete we were told the belt broke and our luggage never arrived. They was around 20 25 other people on our flight that didn't get there luggage. The lady gave us a slip on the slip it said get what items we need and keep our receipts they would reimburse us. All we had was the clothes on our back. We only went down to Tampa for a new years eve event. It was a upscale event we purchased tickets for. So the next day Cincinnati Airport called me and Laura said someone at cvg dropped the ball and FedEx didn't pick our stuff up. She said it's a flight leaving the next morning it will be on there. I asked her to called me the next day to confirm it was on there she did call however she had bad new said the flight got canceled. She said she could FedEx it but now she said we wouldn't get it til Monday and we leave Sunday night. I said that will not work. She said we can get our luggage when we come back that night ... she said she was looking at 100 bags and she felt bad for us. I told her we have nothing but what we had on out back she said go get what you need keep your receipts and we will get our money back. I feel like they should pay for our rooms flights bags the ubers we used to go get things we needed that were in our bags in Cincinnati our clothes we had to buy and the new year eve event we missed. Allegiant emailed me today saying they would reimburse us for the luggage we never got and give a 25 credit for our next flight. I told them no this is unacceptable. This is bad bad service. I also left my number on email and asked for someone to call me. I never received that call.

### "wouldn't let my daughter fly because she's a minor"
I wanted to warn anyone considering having a minor fly alone with Allegiant. Allegiant wouldn't let my daughter fly because she's a minor (3 months from 18) because of the weather (I assume, which I don't know what was so bad about it), so she was stranded at Midway with no flights for her to take. That seems much more dangerous than just letting her sit in a seat (that she paid for) and flying. We had to get her an Uber to O'hare and book her another flight. She had to wait at the O'hare airport for 5 hours before finally flying home. This all started at 3:30am and didn't end until about 8pm. The craziest thing is the crew wouldn't help her at all, just no can't fly with us...good luck.

### "Very unprofessional!"
We scheduled a flight and return flight months ahead, departing from Knoxville to Punta Gorda Fl, Friday December 24th, with a return date of Wednesday, December 29th. While on the beach, late Tuesday afternoon we received notice our return flight was canceled and would not be rescheduled. We had to cut our beach time short so we could try and make arrangements to return. The website would kick us out each time we tried to schedule for the next flight date and phone wait time was est at 3hrs. No rental cars were available, leaving us stranded without enough medicine and a dog sitter leaving. 24hrs later we were able to make other arrangements other than allegiant. Very unprofessional!

### "Absolutely terrible airline"
Not Verified | Had to check all baggage despite being early to airport because they don’t have enough room. Allegiant can not seem to ever get it together, the only reason we’re flying them this time is because we have a voucher from a flight they had to cancel last time in a whole different screw up. Absolutely terrible airline, if you can fly anything else do so.

### "an absolute disgrace"
The manner in which this airline provides service to it's customers is an absolute disgrace. I've been trying to make a change to my reservation for 6 days (emails, chat is disabled and more than 25 attempts to contact by phone). My calls to the company either say "user busy" or I get stuck on hold for hours upon hours. Now, I'm inside of the 7 day window so I'm on the hook to purchase another ticket so I can get to where I need to be.

### "They won't tell us anything"
This is the worst airline I have ever been on. First they say there's too much weight and 3 people need to switch planes or 15 bags need FedEx. Then I find out it is a mechanical issue and still waiting to see if the flight is canceled. Its been over 3 hours and still waiting. They won't tell us anything. Do not fly with Allegiant.

### "Worst airline we’ve ever dealt with"
Not Verified | We’ve had our last 3 flights with Allegiant cancelled, causing additional hotel and rental car fees. My wife has been on hold with their customer service for over 3 hours trying to get a flight home. Last time we had to take Delta home at our expense. Worst airline we’ve ever dealt with.

### "Thankyou for all the hospitality"
Michale (if I'm spelling it correctly) was absolutely amazing. He was extremely accommodating, and helpful with everything I needed & very attentive. I really appreciated the kindness of all the other flight attendants as well, but I didn’t catch their names. The pilot was hilarious, made the flight so much easier. Thankyou for all the hospitality!

### "Flight delayed for 13 hrs"
Not Verified |  Flight delayed for 13 hrs. Get back to the airport only to sit on a plane for 1.5 hours and receive silly excuses. First the plane needs to be deicing, that should have been taken care of, now there's too many Christmas gifts so gas has to be burned. Then this flight is taking 5 hours. Allegiant Air is horrible and there needs to be some type of compensation for this nightmare of a day. Credit funds back or something, there are lies been told somewhere and the least you can do is refund the passengers something.

### "$5 dollars for a printed boarding pass"
Money hungry airline that gives priority to people who pay extra over their Military. I do not recommend this nickel and diming airline. $5 dollars for a printed boarding pass, ridiculous.

### "They were just so rude"
Worst service by air hostesses. They don’t know how to greet their passengers. They were just so rude. It was my 3 months old babies first flight and I wanted to take picture and they were just so Rude that they kicked me out from the plan saying we are not free here. While the pilots were taking pictures with other passengers. It was so rude. Worst service by this air hostesses.

### "cancel flights because they aren’t fully booked"
Received notification at 2am (4 hours before departure) that our flight from Asheville to Key West was cancelled. We received vouchers immediately along with additional $100 voucher for each ticket. To avoid losing $3500 in resort costs we had to rebook and were fortunately able to book to Fort Lauderdale later in the day. We then had to secure a rental car for an additional $1000, drive 4ish hours to Key West, extend our vacation by one day, drive 4 hours back to Fort Lauderdale and book a room in Fort Lauderdale for our final night. Original cancellation was blamed fog- older planes and landing issues. We checked on the day we were originally to return home and our flight from Key West to Asheville was cancelled as well. There was no weather issues in Asheville. Allegiant- don’t cancel your flights because they aren’t fully booked.

### "been on the phone on hold for 3 hours straight"
Not Verified | I paid for a round-trip plane ticket in July to go home for Christmas from Provo to San Diego. When I arrived at the airport on Monday for my flight they told me I was not on the manifest for some reason. I had my confirmation number, the email they sent me, and I checked my bank account and showed them that I had obviously paid $209 in July for my flight. The plane was about to leave but they told me the ONLY way I could get on the flights if I was on the manifest (list of people on the plane). They told me I had to buy another plane ticket to get on the flight which was ridiculous! They told me the next opportunity I would have to get on an allegiant flight would be 4 days later! My brother was with me- he got a ticket the same time I did and he had no problems. They had me pay for another plane ticket and gave me a card for a number I should call to work out these issues and get reimbursed. I have been on the phone on hold for 3 hours straight with no one picking up these fast few days! I am completely stuck. They stole $200 from me and I wish I could reach someone to help me.

### "I would avoid this airline, if possible"
Not Verified |  My flight was cancelled minutes prior to its scheduled takeoff, only after waiting at the gate for 90+ minutes. Since it was a late flight, it was rescheduled to the following day. This worked out for some passengers, but certainly not all. There was no notice of flight cancellation in advance, so everyone was scrambling to find accommodation that night and alternative travel options. Thankfully, Allegiant did put us up at a nearby hotel, however, their lack of advance notice was entirely unprofessional. Furthermore, they have made it nearly impossible to get a refund for the canceled flight. I would avoid this airline, if possible.

### "Thanks for making my vacation stressful!"
Not Verified |  Allegiant is by far the worst airline with the worst customer service I have encountered. My husband and I were traveling with young children, and paid for specific seat selection. Upon checking into our flights, our seats were changed without our asking. I tried to email customer service and two weeks later, still no response. Tried to chat with an agent, but no one answered. Tried to call and the wait time was greater than 2 hours. At the counter, they offered us row 31 (we paid for seats in row 2). The same thing happened again on the way back. I was given a customer service number to call - again to wait on hold more than 2 hours. They damaged our stroller and then told us that they accept no responsibility because of their “limited liability policy”. They sent a very snide “apology” saying that we probably don’t agree, but this is our final decision. What terrible customer service. We did have our stroller in a protective bag, but was I shocked by this? No, because they clearly disrespect your items then don’t want to take any responsibility. I’m so upset I gave this airline any of my money. I will never fly Allegiant again. Thanks for making my vacation stressful!

### "I am beyond disgusted"
I am beyond disgusted with the quality & efficiency of this airline. I booked a flight from Nashville to Pittsburgh for 2pm. That flight was delayed & later canceled. Allegiant then booked me on another flight from Nashville to Allentown (opposite way of Pittsburgh) for 7pm. That flight was also delayed & later canceled. Allegiant provided me with an $8 food voucher that no concessions in the airport accepted from me. I am dissatisfied as I don’t think Allegiant takes their passengers into consideration as I had to pay various food & travel expenses & miss work in order to get home. They were also nearly impossible to contact & when I was reached, they were absurd.

### "no one was there to check me in"
I arrived an hour and 30 minutes before my flight and no one was there to check me in. The baggage workers told me the Allegiant airline check in agents left to the gate already for boarding passengers. I was unable to check in. While there is the option to check in online, I needed my bag to be weighed and sent through and no one was there to do that so I couldn’t go on the flight. There was no one for me to speak to. I called customer service they didn’t say sorry they said it was my fault for not being there two hours before. There was the confirmation email sent out recommending two hours before but no where did they say it was required or I would not make the flight. This airline is nonrefundable and non creditable so I couldn’t even get a different flight. Basically if you show up an hour and 30 minutes early instead of 2 hours early they won’t let you on the flight, won’t reschedule and won’t refund you. Without ever telling you it is mandatory or required to arrive two hours early just recommended.

### "several mask violations"
Not Verified | I flew from Indianapolis to Jacksonville on Thursday, December 16th, 2021. Throughout the flight there were several mask violations. A woman let her two children keep their masks only over their chins, one of which was coughing consistently through the flight. There was also a passenger directly in the row behind us who removed his mask and coughed for most of the flight. This passenger was sitting beside a flight attendant, who made no attempts to enforce the rule. Even though they announced over the intercom it was a violation of federal law, no personnel on the plane did anything. Very disappointed. We have been trying to cancel our return flight trip all day but the customer service phone line says the wait time exceeds two hours. Ridiculous.

### "The flights are clean with friendly staff"
Not Verified |  We fly Allegiant at least 6 times a year and our family flies with them very often also. They are absolutely amazing. Some things are a bit different but in my opinion, much improved over other airlines. The drinks are a great deal and the selection is very good. The flights are clean with friendly staff.

### "Never flying this airline again"
Our flight from St Pete Fl to Ashville NC was delayed several hours due to a "bird strike". It was to leave at 9:55pm originally. Then delayed to 11:55pm, then 12:15am, then 12:57am.Then once we finally took off, we were told there was too much fog in Ashville. We flew in circles using reserve fuel according to the pilot waiting for it to clear. When it did not clear we were then told we would be diverted to Knoxville TN and options would be given there. Once we landed all accommodations were taken off the table. No transportation or hotel stay at 4 am. We were to originally land in Ashville, around 11pm Dec 17th. And that was the plan when all the passengers purchased the tickets. Now we have nothing and are told to figure out how we are to get to our destinations on our own at our own expense. This is at no fault of ours but entirely on the airline. The bird strike delay and then a weather issue. They claim that since it's a "weather cancelation" nothing can be done to accommodate the passengers. The weather is "unforeseen circumstances". The weather issue should have been known ahead of time. Allegiant knowingly refused to cancel the flight until it took off to be able to refuse refunds. Now almost 200 passengers including children are stranded in the wrong state and have to figure out what to do next. That is unacceptable. Refunds should be given or the airline should pay to get the passengers to their agreed destination. Or at least somewhere to sleep as their delays got us here at 4am. This is crazy. Never flying this airline again

### "The worst customer service we ever experienced"
2-hour wait time to check in, was told we are late, rushed to check us in, harass us to pay for baggage fee, the baggage ended up being missing. The worst customer service we ever experienced then the worst airline we ever flew with, we would not recommend Allegiant Air for future customers.

### " I will never fly with them again"
Absolutely atrocious. They cancelled our return flight with two hours notice due to “weather.” They gave us a refund but had no other flights until Sunday and refused to offer any form of Compensation for their decision. They said since it was due to weather they don’t have to compensate. Shocking since every other airline was still flying out of California to Utah that day. Just not Allegiant. Seems very convenient for them to cancel a flight and say “not our problem.” I will never fly with them again. The rates are no longer that competitive and after having this experience I would rather go with a big airline who actually cares.

### "lack of concern for passengers was a disgrace"
Due to weather, we were rerouted to Sandford, Florida, 2.5 hours away. The airport was closed due to late hour. Flight was declared “cancelled.” Airline deplaned us at a closed airport, thus, no rental cars, hotel shuttles, airport staff available. Very limited (and premium priced at 2am) Ubers/Lyft available. Many senior citizens on our full flight, with no transportation options available until the airport opened the next morning. Airline offered a small compensation, which didn’t even cover uber cost back to original destination. No refund given for cancelled flight. I know weather emergencies happen, but their poor communication, lack of concern for passengers was a disgrace!

### "never want to fly with Allegiant Air again"
I never want to fly with Allegiant Air again! We were delayed for like 45 minutes because 1 person was missing on the flight. They had to do attendance 3 times & still kept missing 1 single person. It was very frustrating. There were 2 ladies that went up and down the isle to check for the people that were supposed to be on the flight. Instead of having to scan out boarding pass, they only typed in our boarding number. So I already knew something was up. We took off & it was fine for a little bit. And it’s ridiculous how the water is $3. Seriously? I fell asleep & woke up to the lights still on & it was dark outside. People were being very disruptive and just standing up, not in their seats. I was very confused. We got to our destination & we had to wait like 30 mins to get off the plane. It’s like they had to take attendance again. Never again will I fly with Allegiant Air.

### "I will never fly with them again."
I have CoVid and moved my flight to hopefully accommodate my illness. I was told this was a one time courtesy. I ended up being more sick than I thought. I called the next day and customer service said I had my one time courtesy and could call back later as no mangers on duty. Call wait time is up to 2 hrs. I ended up paying for another ticket on a different airline. Very rigid and unaccommodating. I will never fly with them again.

### "absolutely horrible airline"
This is an absolutely horrible airline. Our flight was delayed and hour and we were told the airplane was in route and landing soon. The plane landed and all of the customers got off the airplane. When we were about to board they cancelled the flight last minute. They were unable to find us any flights until the next day which resulted me missing a day of work and pay. They got us a hotel for the night but told us we had to pay for our own transportation and that they would reimburse us. We finally get home and sent our receipts to be reimbursed and were told that it was a misunderstanding that they will not be reimbursing us for our costs of having to pay to get to a hotel or for any of our food costs. All they gave us was an $8 airport food voucher 20 minutes before our rescheduled flight was to board.

### "Horrible airline"
Not Verified |  Horrible airline, didn’t take off until 3 hours after. Horrible service - made us deboard, missed 2 meetings and cancelled plans. Never flying on Allegiant Air again.

### "Hands down worst airline operating in the US"
Not Verified |  Hands down worst airline operating in the US. I’ve had the displeasure of flying with them approximately 6 times over the past year. They are the only option for the route I needed so I kept coming back but I’m officially done. Of the 12 legs on the 6 round trip flights, 4 had delays of 2-6 hours. 1 was canceled while we were en route to the airport and 1 was canceled after we boarded the plane. Don’t fly this airline under any circumstances. Pay more, take a connecting flight. Whatever it takes.

### "4 flight delays"
The worst airline I have ever flown. 4 flight delays, far worse than Spirit. The absolute worst airline experience. Do yourself a favor and stay far away.

### "Email never arrived"
I was issued a travel voucher in December 2020 for $1500 for previous flights cancelled by Allegiant. Voucher had an expiry date of December 2021. Due to COVID, I could not travel and after many calls and emails over several months, they extended deadline to January 2022. I forgot about the voucher and booked a flight for February 2022. When booking this flight, my on-line credentials had no mention of this travel credit. Immediately after booking and filing flight info into my Outlook Allegiant folder, I saw the credit voucher. After numerous emails (phone hold time 1+ hours) with no reply, I couriered a FedEx package showing my voucher along with explanation of flight booked. October 22, 2021 I received a email stating within 48 hours, I'll receive an email from [email protected] to issue a full credit for $1500 travel voucher. Email never arrived. November 10th, couriered another FedEx package with paperwork asking for an update. November 26th, no reply.

### "total lack of customer service"
Not Verified |  My flight was cancelled twice in one week. Both times it was cancelled within a few hours of takeoff. This was the first Thanksgiving trip to family in many years. The last cancellation was so late there were no other fights I could get. People should know about this airlines total lack of customer service.

### "refused to give me my money back"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight for 4 of my in laws, one in a walker and one mentally handicapped with my sister in law and her daughter to come for thanksgiving. I checked them in online 2 days prior and they had their boarding passes ready to go. The bar codes on the boarding passes were not working so they wouldn’t let them on the flight. They also asked several people at the airport for help as to what to do and could not get anyone to help them. I was on hold for 1 hr 37 minute trying to get through to Allegiant trying to get a refund or get them on the next flight. They offered to fly them to Phoenix, Az 4 days later but I would have to pay again and refused to give me my money back. I’m outraged and will never use them again and am out $554.00. They clearly don’t have compassion for senior citizens or people trying to be together for the holidays.

### "absolutely terrible in every way"
Allegiant is absolutely terrible in every way. They don't open check-in desk until 2 hours before so if you have to check a bag you are waiting forever and cannot enjoy the lounge. The flights are always delayed seemingly for no reason. Why are we always sitting on the plane for 1 hour before taking off? What is wrong with this airline? The seats are incredibly tiny which is to be expected from budget carrier but stop making us sit on the flight for longer than needed. On a positive note, I have only witnessed positive staff members and they are very good at enforcing the mask mandate which unfortunately some of the lower end customers of Allegiant don't want to follow.

### "Never again will I fly Allegiant!"
Four days before a long anticipated trip, our outgoing flight was canceled, requiring us to pay more than twice the original price to use a different airline. On our way to the airport for the return flight we received a message that it was canceled as well, necessitating a very last minute high price flight on another airline with an all night layover. Never again will I fly Allegiant!

### "not be using Allegiant air for future flights"
My husband and I were supposed to fly out of Chattanooga to Orlando on Sunday night October 31, 2021. That flight was canceled until the next day at 2:30 PM in which that caused us to miss a full day at the Disney part we had already paid for. However we did proceed with our flight schedule to enjoy the rest of the days in Orlando. Our returning flight was to leave out at 7:42 PM on Thursday evening November 4, 2021. When we arrived at the airport two hours early we receive the news our flight has been delayed until 10:00 PM. At a later time we receive news the delay has been pushed back to midnight. Our flight was eventually canceled in which they did not offer a returning flight the next day. We had to get home to our sons state playoff game but they only offer the next flight home which was the following Sunday. We were told our other option will be a full refund! Therefore we opted for that choice. However after booking another flight the next day home having to rent a vehicle and spending a total of $660 we get home to find out we are only reimbursed for half of what we were told we would be reimbursed for. Upon speaking with staff they would not follow through with what we had been told we would receive and did not five any further compensations at all. This was their mistake and was the ONLY reason we opted for the refund! Now not only are we out of pocket for the Disney park we didn’t make it to in time, we are also out of pocket for most of the $660.00 we had to pay for a returning flight the next day along with a car rental! This is poor business but I found out very quickly they do not care! And they obviously do not follow through with the information they give to their customers! I will not be using Allegiant air for future flights.

### "told me that I had missed my flight"
I’ve never had an issue before with allegiant but today, we encountered a particularly sadistic receptionist. We checked our bag and I had my boarding pass screen shot and ID ready. The screen shot was of too poor quality to scan (my bad). I asked if she could print my pass and she refused saying download the allegiant app. I asked again and she rolled her eyes and said no, download the app. I download the app and am locked out of my boarding pass (I think bc I viewed them on kiwi first?). The tsa printing machines are all not working so I run back down to the counter. I was served by the same receptionist who told me that I had missed my flight and was too late (it was 10 min before the doors closed). She said she too was locked out of the boarding pass too and couldn’t print them. When I explained the situation, she raised her voice at me, stating that I took up her line. Realizing she’s ready to full on yell at me, I request to just reschedule the flight if I am too late. She says she has one three days from now. At this point, I’m desperate because I’m a veterinarian and have a day full of appointments to see tomorrow. She suddenly says actually just try and prints my boarding pass! She lied about not having access then also held them hostage from me when she could have printed them for me 10 minutes ago, knowing I was missing my flight. She never offered to call ahead to check on where the flight was and guess what? It was still boarding and we made it.

### "Worst airline experience by far"
Not Verified |  This airline decided to cancel our tickets to Las Vegas and they did not offer an explanation as to why. When I tried to contact them via phone, I had to sit on hold for hours. When trying to chat with them, they never had an available agent. This airline is a joke. They will never get my business, no matter how cheap they are, and you all should do the same. Worst airline experience by far and I do a lot of flying.

### "don’t want to fly Allegiant ever again"
The worst airline. Today our flight was canceled within minutes of boarding. They had 8 seats available and we didn’t get either of the 8 seats and I booked 2 months in advance. All they could offer us was a 150.00 voucher. I don’t want to fly Allegiant ever again so that voucher is not going to suit me at all. Book at your own risk. This company is horrible and now I’m out of more money.

### "Worst customer service"
Not Verified |  I had the worst experience ever with Allegiant Airlines. They canceled my flight 2 hours before departure and when I asked for compensation for a non-refundable hotel that I booked, they did not take any responsibility. I chatted to an agent named online and he cut the chat. I called the customer service and they cut my phone after they asked for my information. Worst customer service. They don't value you.

### "Avoid this company at all costs"
Friday flight starts with a 6+ hour delay. No reason for the delay, no monetary compensation for the delay and a $50 credit for future flight was offered. Sunday flight home, starts with a 1 hour delay, then turns into a 2 hour delay and then at 9PM they decide to cancel the flight with no explanation. I call to get on another flight and they offer Monday night as an option. I tell them I need to leave in the morning for work and they tell us sorry. I ask to speak with a supervisor and they put me on hold for almost 50 minutes. By the time the supervisor gets on the phone, they tell me that Monday night flight is sold out as well and the next flight is Wednesday night. They offered us $250 each for the "inconvenience". When I explained that it cost us thousands to drive in a car to South Carolina (hours away), for new flights booked the day of, for a hotel and for meals, they told me sorry and that they are not even required to give us anything. What kind of customer service is this? Worst airline experience I've had in my life and I work in the industry. Avoid this company at all costs. They are clueless when it comes to being guest centric. I have emailed them multiple times since my experience and no replies have been given in over a month now. What a joke of an airline.

### "No customer service available"
Not Verified |  Never again. We flew with no issues Indy to Orlando/Sanford. Our flight on the way back was delayed by 45 minutes (turned out over an hour). Then once we landed it took over an hour for them to get us our checked luggage. No customer service available to call or in the airport at all. Emailed them immediately with my complaint and have not heard back.

### "Flight was great"
Not Verified |  Flight was great. Both from SGF to LAX and back. For a budget airline seats were comfortable enough and had leg room. Flight attendants need sensitivity and manners training. Flight was on time, no hassle.

### "never fly with Allegiant again"
Would never fly with Allegiant again. Paid an insane amount extra for carry on which I then discovered I wouldn’t have needed to do. Then my return flight was canceled only an hour before and I received no help in getting a new flight to my destination. Allegiant didn’t have any other flights for four days. Have to pay on board even for water. Terrible experience.

### "stranded with my dog at the airport"
I always fly with my service animal. I went to drop off my bag at the counter and showed them my ticket. The girl said she couldn't find my DOT service animal form. I showed her in my phone the email that Allegiant had requested with the pdf form attached. She said she wasn't sure if she could accept that as evidence. I opened the pdf for her to see. She said that would not work now because they would have needed that form 48 hours earlier. I said, you really aren't going to tell me that I can't fly today? Yes sir, that's right. I told her and the weekend manager that I wasn't leaving unless I got on that plane. She called a security guard and the manager said "We've cancelled your reservation and returned your money sir. I've never had an airline work so hard to not accept a fare before. I'm 66yo, disabled, and after Uber had dropped me off after an hour I was then stranded with my dog at the airport looking for a way to go home

### "mistreats its customers"
Not Verified | Grand Rapids to California. The way Allegiant mistreats its customers is unacceptable. I had a flight today scheduled for 6:30 am from Grand Rapids, Michigan to Los Angeles, California. 4 hours before the flight Allegiant cancels the flight without explanation. They send you a text and an email at 2:00 am saying "sorry, your flight has been canceled". It is a total lack of respect for the customer. Allegiant does not care if we have to pay one more day for a hotel, car rental, food and having to buy another flight at the last minute with how expensive the tickets are. Allegiant has to take responsibility and refund every penny we had to spend for the last minute cancellation. It is a disgrace that they mistreat their clients this way.

### "Outstanding customer service"
Not Verified | St. Petersburg to Newburgh. First time having family fly from St Pete airport. Outstanding customer service. Very polite and friendly service. Excellent assistance with two wheel chairs and allowing me to get a pass to go with them until boarding time. The entire staff and security was friendly and always smiling. Will continue to fly from here. Airport was clean and very organized.

### "would not recommend this airline"
I would not recommend this airline. We had been in the air until we were supposed to be landing and then they announced there was no power At the airport so we had to divert to Sarasota. Not Tampa or St. Pete which are in the same area. I am not clear on why we couldn’t circle until they figured out the issue. Then they wouldn’t let us off the plane in Sarasota as we sat on the tarmac because we couldn’t go to a gate and we needed fuel to get back to Clearwater where we were supposed to land originally. I’m out the money I spent to book a car at the airport and now not sure if I can get one to get home.

### "more stressful than any other flight"
My fiancé is a transplant patient and now waiting for another transplant. She has a designated medical service dog, not an emotionally support dog, and actual trained, doctor prescribed (UofU transplant team) service dog who detects and warns of blood sugar levels. Normal airlines allow at time of check in to allow verification of service dog. I called before the flight and waited on hold for 90mins to speak with a customer service agent who explained since it was within 48hrs of the flight I would need to bring her verification letter to the desk check in. We arrived early and was told abruptly by the gate check in that she needs prior approval and wouldn't even listen or talk to us as other people were on the flight and wouldn't discuss it, she just kept saying "it's not my choice it's not my problem". We waited for the line to go down and then I showed her on their own website that at the gate the gate agent can accept the paperwork. She refused. She then called customer service herself and told me on the phone that there was nothing that could he done. He said he had no record of me calling, he told me there was nothing to be done and then because I got upset and angry that if I didn't let him finish telling me how it was all my fault he would cancel our tickets with no refund. I asked what we could do then he said "find somewhere to put your pet". I then asked if I could just take her on as a regular pet, of course I could, for $50! But then complained that the bag she was in was not compliant (service dogs don't have to be in regular bags, she has a designated bag). After arguing again with the service gate agent she finally accepted my money but with condition it was non refundable but the air stewards could still refuse the bag. We rush to the plane where the air stewards at first refused, then when we explained she was a service dog and showed her service vest still resisted. The stewardess than says "oh the vest doesn't mean anything you can just buy that online" I then showed them the written doctors note and she simply said fine and wouldn't look at us. It's a 1hr 45min flight and has been more stressful than any other flight I've been on. The staff are rude, won't accept responsibility and all they want is to nickel and dime your money. Even if it seems cheaper, never fly this airline.

### "I do not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  I do not recommend this airline. Our family was looking forward to a trip to Florida for two years. There was also a very important event that we were planning to attend there. Our youngest (5 years old) was excited as this trip would supposedly be her first time on an airplane. Imagine our disappointment when we were told that our flight would be delayed by 45 minutes due to a problem. And then 2 hours. And finally, after waiting for two and a half hours, it was announced that our flight was canceled. There was no possible way for us to get to our destination. The man who announced this (a crew member) seemed very impatient and annoyed with the crowd. We had booked two hotels for out stay. We were forced to call those two hotels and request a refund from each. One hotel was not able to provide us with a refund but the other was able to give us a refund for one day. Logically, we would also be unable to attend the race, which the kids were also looking forward to. The kids were extremely disappointed and we drove home in low spirits. In total, we wasted around five hours waiting in the airport.

### "Last time we will fly Allegiant"
Not Verified |  This is 3 for 3 since last March. Long delay for the 1st blunder causing us to miss our connection. 7 hour wait for a new connection. 2nd blunder. Woke up early and checked status of flight only to find it was canceled. No bad weather, no explanation, just canceled. 3rd blunder. Bad weather caused inability to land at Key West. Took us to Punta Gorda and dropped us off. Told if we got off in Punta Gorda we were on our own, only other choice was to fly back to Cincinnati. Last time we will fly Allegiant.

### "This airline needs to shut down"
Not Verified |  I will never use this airline ever again! I do not recommend anyone to use it! Our flight was for 8:30 PM departure and they started sending us msg delaying out flight early in the AM! All day they couldn’t decide what time we were departing. They told us the flight was departing at 11PM and as soon as we got there it changed to 2:30AM, after almost 5 hrs waiting, the plane got there and they changed the departure to 3:30AM, and guess what happened? They cancelled our flight due to flight attendants not being able to work for the rest of the night. this flight had at least 50 kids ready to go to Disney, kids sleeping on the floor! No food available at the airport, no one to help! This airline needs to shut down.

### "never recommend taking this airline"
Not Verified |  This might be the worst airline I’ve ever taken. I would never recommend taking this airline. It’s terrible, flights get delayed, you don’t get what you are promised, it’s all in all awful airline. Even if it’s cheaper, allegiant is not worth it in the slightest. You can almost guarantee you flight is delayed or canceled and you don’t get what you paid for. The best part is that they had every opportunity to fix their mistake and they never do.

### "No empathy, just a sad sorry"
Not Verified |  Twice burned! I should have known better. Cancelled 3 flights on me, 2 in one day - what's worse, they had no alternative and I was going to a funeral. No empathy, just a sad "sorry". I am now sitting in an airport 2 hours from home missing the funeral and no help with my getting home. This also happened on a flight with my dear brother who was going of cancer. After going to airport, waiting through 3 delays, they cancelled the flight. Had to drive my brother back home another 2 hour drive.

### "on hold with customer service for 2 hours"
They delayed my flight twice then cancelled. Nobody will answer the phones or online chat I have been on hold with customer service for 2 hours. They will not give us a reason why they cancelled the flight and only want to give us a credit for all the money spent. They didn’t even give us a notification that it was delayed / cancelled until we were getting ready to leave so all the money we spent on rental car and hotel stay just went down the drain because the check in date has passed so it’s now non refundable. they don’t make any effort to get you on a different flight they expect you to figure it out on your own and “hope for the best”.

### "The representatives do not seem to care about the customer"
Not Verified |  Charges to print your boarding pass! Our flight was delayed for several hours with no explanation or indication of time for delay. Communication is key. The representatives do not seem to care about the customer. This is a quick way to go out of business. We will never use this airline again.

### "Satisfied returning customer"
Not Verified |  This is more of a shout out for common sense despite the rules. Due to a mistake by our bank, our payment for bags did not go through ,more bank issues also meant we had no cash or means of using our cards. Moments before boarding, we were at a loss-as how to resolve the issue. Miriam realized our dilemma and allowed us to board without luggage payment. Thankyou Miriam for using common sense. Satisfied returning customer.

### "This airline is great for a quick cheap flight"
Not Verified |  Not bad for the price. This airline is great for a quick cheap flight. I will admit that both my departure and arrival flight ran a little late but it wasn't terrible. You also have to pay for drinks/refreshments which i think most airlines still do provide the most basic refreshments for free. I also got my luggage checked for free because it was only "slightly" bigger than a carry on for my return flight. I think for the price I paid (150 RT to Tennessee from Chicago) this was well worth it. I would definitely utilize this airline again. Their app was also very user friendly and came in handy when I almost missed my departure flight.

### "Poor communication all around"
They charge you for everything imaginable. 5 bucks to print a boarding pass. I prepaid my checked bag to avoid their arbitrary additional fees. It was a pound or two over, so I had to pay 50 more dollars. Their weight limit is also 40 pounds. Literally every other US carrier I looked up is 50 pounds. I’ll never fly with them again if I can avoid it. Flight was delayed. Gates moved. Poor communication all around.

### "Absolute train wreck of a flight"
Absolute train wreck of a flight. Was supposed to take off at 908 pm 30 September 2021. Didn't take off until after 2 am. Arrived at Gand Rapids at almost 5 am. So now I have to wait at the airport until the rental car place opens at 8am. Also no ride to my hotel room so lost out on that. And all they offered us was a lowsy food voucher. Yep done with this airline. I guess when they mean cheap fares that means service too.

### "additional $50 for a carry on bag"
Worst airline ever. Customer service sucks. Had to pay an additional $50 for a carry on bag that was already paid for. Fees, fees and more fees. Take your money and fly another airline. This will be my last flight on this airline.

### "Worst airline out there"
Was going to arrive on time (30 minutes before boarding started) and was an hour into my drive to the airport. I then checked my ticket to see that they had moved my flight 40 minutes earlier so I missed my flight and now have to drive home. Worst airline out there.

### "nickel and dimes you for everything"
From check in to flight Allegiant looks to lure you in with a great up front price then nickel and dimes you for everything. $20 for emergency exit for leg room, $30-$50 for carry on and checked bag $5 to ask for help at check in Snacks and beverages cost in flight In addition to the grift on your wallet the airplane itself is cheap and sounds and looks like it's going to rattle apart. The staff hate their jobs, and you if you ask for help in any way they'll be curt and rude to you the whole time while they "help" you. They try to infect your phone with their cheap data mining low quality app. They sell your email and advertise to you constantly. Buyer beware, this airline sucks and I will not recommend it and I won't use it again.

### "1/3 of the total cost as unreturnable fees"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline. When purchasing all indication is you can cancel free and apply full purchase price to a future trip. However, when you actually are ready to cancel you find they charge almost 1/3 of the total cost as unreturnable fees. Trying to call gets you on hold forever and you never get through. The option to live chat is met with a message "no agents available". After being nickel and dimed when buying the ticket you are met with many dollars fees when you need to cancel. Stay away or at least know that if you have to cancel you are going to lose a good portion of your payment.

### "without ever leaving on time"
For the love of all that is good and right, please don’t fly this airline! I cannot believe I had to use them again. I swore them off after multiple frustrating trips - without ever leaving on time. Here we went again! Horrible service, expensive tickets, never on time. That has happened 3/4 times I have flown- the other time was just 2 hours on the tarmac without an explanation.

### "Worst airline I've ever flown"
Worst airline I've ever flown with and I will never be stepping on to one of their aircrafts ever again. One employee was the rudest woman I've ever come across let alone to actually have someone of her caliber to actually be working for an airline says absolutely everything about their airline!

### "every time there has been a delay"
Great news they said: “there’s a direct flight from Santa Ana, CA to Medford, OR (where my wife’s parents live)… your family can fly from its new home in Orange County to Medford so to see the grandparents and vice versa”. Well, as of today we are on our fourth leg of doing so and every time there has been a delay. Maintenance today, as was the case on the first leg of the first trip, while on the other two delayed legs the issues have been unexplained. Seats are rock hard, flight attendants are rude, and we all know how these “discount” airlines charge for everything you do (pick your seat, carry on a bag, etc, etc) after paying the “affordable fare.” I really don’t care about all that, and was just happy to have a direct flight, but since Allegiant’s planes seems to be delayed 100% of the time it’s probably just as well to book on a real airline and make a connection in San Francisco or Portland. Allegiant is a joke.

### "incredibly irritating"
Orlando Sanford to Cincinnati. I am so tired of this. The airplane was originally supposed to take off at 11:43 and land at 1:45. The flight has been continuously being delayed over and over again, mind you it’s not due to weather, something about paper work (which you think an airline would have everything complete before the flight) We boarded the airplane at 12:44 and we have just all been sitting here crammed for almost 2 hours now waiting to take off. We have been sitting on this airplane longer than the flight was supposed to be. So what was really only supposed to be 2 hours on the uncomfortable plane, has now turned into 4 hours. All the children in the airplane are all screaming their heads off and I genuinely don’t blame them, this whole situation is incredibly irritating.

### "plane was absolutely filthy"
The plane was absolutely filthy. We walked up to our seats and had to brush chips off of the seat to sit down. The floor was covered in food. I’ve flown allegiant, delta, southwest, and more, never have experienced such poor quality on a plane. The worker was nasty, rude, and made us pay $50 for the same carry on bag that we brought with us to Savannah with the same airline and we did not pay for a bag traveling to. I have always traveled with a purse and have never been told that was considered my one personal item and I would have to pay $50 if my purse did not fit in my bookbag. Overall, If the worker has handled this differently, we may feel differently; but because of her disgusting attitude and the filth of the flight, I will never fly Allegiant again and will never recommend them to anyone ever. In fact, spend the extra money to fly another airline that treats you with decency and cleans between flights. We are in a global pandemic and this flight WAS NOT CLEANED before we boarded. They actually boarded early and took off early and had no time to clean.

### "not care about helping a customer"
Not Verified |  I had a trip planned to fly from St Cloud MN to Destin FL to ask my girlfriend to marry. 6 days before we were to leave we receive an email that our flight was cancelled. I couldn’t believe it. How could you do that to someone then offer no consolation. They couldn’t get me another flight. They do not work with any other airline. Allegiant bullied me into making a decision whether I wanted my money back or vouchers. They stated I have 48hrs or I will receive vouchers. No other airport was flying into Destin FL so our whole trip was messed up. We had to replan the entire trip due to not flying into Destin. All of my deposits were not refunded due to the short notice. I had to spend an extra $2k to make my trip work. I had to rebook flights and hotels and rental cars. I reached out to Allegiant to look for some sort of help or reimbursement for all the money I was out. I received nothing. For a month I reached out to them and finally received the most generic email ever. Allegiant does not care about helping a customer. Honestly, I have flown so many different airlines and this one makes Spirit look like a private jet.

### "understand that when you fly Allegiant, you are going to be nickel and died, but "
Not Verified |  I will never fly with Allegiant again due to their lack of communication and disrespect. My flight to LAX was fine. Had a few surprises, but nothing to really gripe about. My flight back home, however, was a disaster. We got to the airport to check our bag and were met with over an hour wait. The check in gate opened exactly 2 hours prior to departure and only one person came out at that time. She was very slow moving and was more interested in talking to the gentlemen helping her load the bags onto the conveyer than she was to help those of us waiting. About 30 minutes later, a second woman came out to help followed shortly after by a third. We finally made it to the front of the line and I asked to speak with someone so I could address my concerns. The woman helping us promptly raised her voice with me and began talking over me telling me I should have "checked my app. I let her know we just wanted to be sure we had time to feed the kids we were traveling with before it was time to board and she told me that was "too bad because the terminal is under construction and they have no food. At this point, I just wanted to leave and get to my gate because I'm feeling very frustrated and disrespected. She finishes with our bag and when I ask for my receipt she cuts me off and says to just update the app. I understand that when you fly Allegiant, you are going to be nickel and died, but I still expected good communication and customer service. I have reached out to Allegiant 3 times in the last week and have yet to get a response. Fly with caution.

### "leaving us stranded in Montana"
The airline cancelled my flight last minute leaving us stranded in Montana. We have spent 5+ hours on hold with customer service to only be hung up on. We have sent 10-15 emails with no response from airline. We have requested reimbursement via BBB, DOT, and the airline with no response. I am owed $752.80.

### "I will never fly Allegiant again"
The agent didn't say final call so I missed my flight! I have herniated discs and it's difficult for me to stand in line. They called the final call for all flights before mine. a different agent actually called out the names of people that were missing on other flights with the same company. I saw a different agent shut the door and my friend ran to the gate to try to get us on that flight. The flight was delayed because of fog so I had to sit at the gate for over 3 hours. They charged me extra to put me on a flight that was 4 hours away from where I was actually going. It was a horrible experience. All because this agent didn't say last call for boarding. I will never fly Allegiant again and I will never recommend this company to anybody!

### "I greatly appreciate the patience she had with us"
My husband and myself had a couple of problems boarding the airplane. Once we were on and seated a stewardess heard us talking about being upset. She handled her job very well and professionally and she got us calmed down. Took my information and gave me a card to explain what happened at the airport. She gave it to her supervisor and everything was taken care of. I greatly appreciate the patience she had with us and her professionalism. I can’t thank her enough. We will definitely be traveling by flight with Allegiant any time me travel!

### "Very annoyed"
Flight was delayed twice because their employees were late and calling off. Everyone at the gate was notified by phone first before the gate attendant decided to say something. Very annoyed.

### "I couldn’t check my bags"
I was going to fly out of Phoenix gateway in Mesa Arizona to Des Moines Iowa. I went to check my bags and the agent tells me I couldn’t check my bags. I would have to have someone pick up my items and had 15 minutes to do so. I informed the agents no one would make it in time. So please take my luggage off the plane. They informed me It was then 10 minutes later said it wasn’t. They told me I have to wait till Friday for my luggage to be delivered back in Phoenix. Or i could play to do next day shipping or travel to Iowa go get it. I ended up paying for a flight to Des Moines the next morning at 10 am. When I got there the counter was closed. So I had to wait another 24 hours to get my belongings. I now had to miss two days of work and my return flight was delayed.

### "start demanding I check my bag"
Not Verified |  While the flight attendants were nice the employee working at the counter at the Key West airport was horrible. I simply asked for a printed boarding pass. She instead decided to be aggressive and start demanding I check my bag. I told her the bag for coming down fit but she demanded I check my bag even though I paid already for a carry on. She also scanned my ticket going onto the plane and I said thank you and she screamed at me “what did you say?” Very unprofessional. I would suggest not having unprofessional employees like this. I attached photos of other people’s luggage that are clearly bigger than they are suppose to but they were allowed to bring a carry on. Completely unacceptable, you should never be conventional with the customer.

### "Unacceptable level of service"
Not Verified |  I am a frequent Allegiant passenger, they are the only airline that does not provide baggage check staff availability 2 hours before boarding time as the TSA recommends. My wife and I were standing for 1 hour and 45 minutes just to check bags and hoping to get a meal after clearing security on Aug 10th while flying back from a Nashville weekend. Unacceptable level of service! Frontier has my next flight!

### "couldn’t get out for 2 more days"
I would give them 0 stars if that was an option! The customer service my family and I experienced was horrendous. The service attendant refused to print boarding passes for my husband and kids, sending them through TSA without boarding passes. Of course, TSA couldn’t let them through so we went back up to the ticket counter and was then told that since the plane was already boarding now, she couldn’t print tickets. So we missed our flight and couldn’t get out for 2 more days and had to pay $75 a ticket to rebook our flight that they caused us to miss. When I questioned the customer service lady and her supervisor on why they wouldn’t print boarding tickets she lied and said we never asked. The prices may be low but they will scam you every chance they can! !

### "They really don’t seem to care"
Not Verified |  One week prior to leaving the first leg of my flight to San Diego was cancelled. Consequently I needed to book with another airlines (at my cost). The very next day my return flight was canceled, once again, with me having to pay for one of my flights home. They’d either pay for San Diego to Phoenix, or Phoenix to Bellingham… not both. In the meantime when booking with another airline, that flight was cancelled, 12 hours before my flight. It all started with Allegiant, & they say it’s all due to Covid. I talked to an agent, & my response was that due to the Delta variant, people are canceling flights. How long can an airline stay in business with this type of customer service? They really don’t seem to care. I, being one customer, had to pay more than my flight cost for additional routes. It’s quite pathetic that they treat customers this way, & I won’t be recommending flying Allegiant to anyone I speak to, inquiring about my experience.

### "I’m so upset on all the money and time wasted with this airline"
Not Verified |  I will never fly Allegiant again! First, I was given an email and text message that mine and my families flight was delayed to 1.25. So we get there an hour before “take off” and was told the Fort Wayne flight already took off. In other words it was never delayed it took off on its original time of take off. Another thing is they set me up with a different flight for the next day to fly to South Bend airport and charged me $75 a person because of changing flights. There was 11 of us in total we paid an extra $825 for their mistake! I will not fly with Allegiant ever again, I’m so upset on all the money and time wasted with this airline. I have proof of all the things I wrote here today!

### "never had such a horrible experience"
Not Verified |  This was my first experience ever with Allegiant, and let me tell you, this will be my last ever unless I have no choice! My grandma unexpectedly passed away and my sister and I needed to fly down from Anchorage, AK to Harlingen, TX for my grandma's cremation. We bought our tickets through Kayak.com; we were supposed to leave from Anchorage and fly straight to LAX (Los Angeles, CA) with Alaska Airlines and then from LAX straight to McAllen, TX with Allegiant. We already had to worry about the hassle of getting off of our Alaska Airlines flight, getting our luggage, bringing it to the Allegiant counter to re-check the baggage, and then going back through security in LAX to get to our gate with Allegiant, and we had less than an hour to get it all done! By some miracle, the plane leaving LAX was delayed, but even with the delay and us running our butts off through the terminals we just made it to the gate .... only to find out 20 mins later that the flight was completely cancelled due to crew. Allegiant refused to give my sister and me any kind of assistance out if a situation they put is in. We were 100% stranded in LA; since this trip was last minute and sudden, we had used all of our money plus help friends to get down to TX in the first place. When the flight to McAllen was cancelled, the only thing Allegiant offered was a refund plus compensation OR a rebooking on the next flight to McAllen which wasn't until Saturday morning. Mind you, the cancelled flight was supposed to fly out at 8 AM Wednesday morning, and the next flight out was Saturday morning. There were no hotel vouchers offered to help with the two day wait time, which left my sister and me stranded in the airport. Allegiant didn't bother to help with finding any type of connecting flights. Even if you had elected the refund, there was a 5 - 10 business day wait on actually receiving the refund, so we couldn't exactly go back to the counters to buy another ticket to McAllen, which was THE only other solution Allegiant offered; which was even more money out of my pocket that I didn't have. When I asked them if there were ANY other options they could help with, all I was told was that I could elect to receive the refund and compensation OR wait for the next flight. Those were my only two options, with no other assistance at all out of the airport. They said those were my only two options: refund and compensation or wait for Saturday morning. With no where to wait. I've never had such a horrible experience flying. Ever. When we started trying to call around to see if there was any other airline that could get us out, the other airline's response was "well at least they can go wait at the hotel while we figure this out" and when we told them Allegiant hadn't even offered any type of hotel vouchers or anything, even THEY were shocked. Like I said, this was my first experience flying with Allegiant and it was horrible enough that I will avoid them at all costs and will tell everyone I know to do the same. I hope that Allegiant will look at their customer service procedures and modify them for future situations like these so that other people that may end up in a similar situation may have a better experience than I did.

### "Worst airline I ever flew on"
Worst airline I ever flew on. I purchase a round trip ticket but had to find my own way home at my expense because the airline forgot to rebook me on a flight with my fiancé after our original flight was canceled. I was told I would be refunded and compensated. I was refunded but never compensated. It cost me more money to get home because I had to catch a Uber and had to fly out of Orlando on a totally different Airline because Allegiant refuse Place me as a priority .. my fiance had suffered a stroke and seizures and was recently released from the hospital, so she had to fly home alone unaccompanied. I tried calling the airline to resolve the issue but had to wait on the phone for three hours before talking to someone only to be told I would not be compensated - the airline gave us $100 for the cancellation to stay at a hotel but never compensated me for my expense to get to another Airport and purchasing my ticket. I repeatedly request that I be compensated but Allegiant Air refuse to consider. Allegiant Air that's not care about it's passenger it only cares about the passengers money.

### "a flight attendant was late"
Worst airline. Flight got delayed because a flight attendant was late. A whole plane of passengers had to wait over an hour to board because one employee couldn't be on time but everyone else has to.

### "Terrible service and we barely got our bags back"
Not Verified |  Awful me and my friend were stranded in the airport because they wouldn’t let us board, we are both 16 years old and are allowed to fly alone but because of “weather” and “visibility” they let everyone board except for us, the guy was very rude and didn’t help us at all, he said the next available flight was 4 days later! Terrible service and we barely got our bags back before the flight took off.

### "worst mistake I have done"
Not Verified |  I booked ticket with Allegiant Air one way from Indianapolis to Los Angeles. That is worst mistake I have done. Flight was over booked, captain called in sick and flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. I was charged 120$ for one way and 20$ for carryon bag. No in flight services, not even water, no charging ports.

### "needed to cancel only my outbound flight"
Not Verified |  Ok, I get it. Covid, .discount airline...labor shortage etc. I get it. But no context excuses how abysmally bad Allegiant Air's customer service is. I booked a flight for my wife and I. After we booked, circumstances changed and I needed to cancel only my outbound flight. Their website has instructions on how to cancel all passengers' outbound flight and how to cancel only 1 passenger's entire flight, but again, I need 1 passenger, only only 1 leg of the trip cancelled and I cannot find out how to do that. So I tried their online chat function and got a message that no agents were available. So I tried an hour late, then a day later, then a few days later .. same response every time. I reluctantly tried calling their customer service about 15 times and every time the number was disconnected or busy. The only possible explanation, is that the company has fired every single customer service agent.

### "never heard anything from the airline,"
Not Verified |  4 of my children flew on this airline. Somehow, my youngest daughter's suitcase is missing. So, we let them know that it was missing and they gave us a claim number and on the piece of paper they gave us said that if her suitcase wasn't found within a certain amount of time, to call the claims department. So I called the number and all it does is ring once and then instant voicemail. That alone is frustrating! I left a voicemail stating the claim number and never heard back from them after calling numerous times. So I noticed that there was an email, and I emailed them, and they send a return (I am assuming an automatic reply) message, stating how anything over $100 of items need to have had a receipt. My daughter was gone for 7 days! There are 7 days worth of clothes, and their grandparents bought stuff for them. How do you account for something that was purchased a long time ago!? That is insane! The luggage was probably had about $500 worth of stuff in it. Granted mostly clothes, but it was money spent! I got tired of calling and never heard anything from the airline, they don't care, and honestly, this has never even happened to us. I would have expected more professionalism in this, and I understand that airlines are busy and luggage gets lost a lot. So maybe compensate for that?! Have more staff to better assist your customers! I can't believe that it has been over a month and I have not heard anything about my daughters suitcase! If people need to contact your claims department, someone should be at the phones. Pandemic or not! We are all back to real life, and you are running a business! So really everyone needs to get with the program!

### "recommend you avoid Allegiant"
Had our flight cancelled, not postponed, but cancelled! Had to then wait over 4 days to get another flight. When asking about the reason for the cancellation, they would only say operations reasons. Called to ask what this means and waited on hold for over an hour. When I finally was answered, I asked what “operational reasons” means and they wouldn’t tell me a specific, but would say it could mean staffing issues, supply shortages etc. When I finally get a flight 4 days later, my bag weighed 1 pound over the 40 point limit (I had to buy some more clothes since my trip length more than doubled). The lady at check in tells me the extra weight is $50! I ask to quickly pull a couple things out to move into my carry on and she acts all disgusted. I then leave my bag and get through security to my gate when I get called over the intercom to return to the check in counter. When I get there the lady asks what I did with the luggage losing sticker on my suitcase. I say I did nothing and she is accusing me of removing it. She then asks if I was traveling with someone and I reply that I am (my wife). And she then accuses that she must’ve removed it! I assure her that isn’t possible because she wasn’t even with me at check in counter when I dropped off the bag. She then tells me to wait there and goes trying to check all over the airport for the sticker that must’ve fallen off. She finally returns with my bag and discovers that the sticker was stuck on the bottom all along… She then tries to tell me that it was my fault for setting my suitcase on the scale wrong? (I set it on its side and she stuck the sticker on the bottom). To fix her mistake she tells me to go to the back of the regular check in line and wait to get a new bag tag to put the sticker on the top! As we are at the gate to board I witnessed two other incidents of altercations with Allegiant employees and it was a small flight! One passenger ended up crying and saying how they will never be flying Allegiant again and how terrible the service is. A quick weekend trip ended up costing me thousands of dollars for my wife and I in missed work, hotel, clothes, food etc. To reiterate, I will and would recommend you avoid Allegiant. They trick you into booking with low fare but you end up spending way more than if you just booked with a better airline. Allegiant made very little attempt to make anything better and I am extremely disappointed.

### "I don’t understand how this airline even functions"
I used to fly Allegiant all the time back 7-15 years ago. They have continued to decline in service but for the price I don't expect it to be perfect. I’ve had two flights canceled by them leaving me stranded, because of Covid I have been more than understanding, however my last experience will insure I never use them again. I bought a ticket for my brother to visit me. I paid extra for all the protection and ability to change my flight especially due to covid and issues arising with that. Sure enough a Covid issue occurred and I needed to reschedule my flight. I tried going online and couldn’t change my flight, I called the customer service number and it was disconnected, I tried the chat and there was no one there. I started this process of trying to get a hold of them three weeks before the flight. I emailed their customer service three times. No response. A week before the flight with no other choice I canceled the flight instead of rescheduling it. Now I am out all of the fees and processing of the flight instead of being able to reschedule it at no cost. I received a voucher and when I tried to look into booking another flight there were no flights out of LAX for the rest of the year and none into next as well. My voucher is only good until April of 2022 which is a year from when I bought the ticket not the flight in July. After researching I discovered they are moving terminals at my airport which is why I'm guessing they have no flights, so I will have to drive to another city to use my voucher and fly out of it. My option is Vegas which means I have to fly or drive there (will cost more than the voucher is worth) they are not helping with the situation or extending my time considering I cannot fly due to their issue not mine. Today I received an email stating that they received my email to them more than a month ago and over two weeks after my flight was to take place. If you don’t have people to answer your phones or answer your chats and your email responses are taking place after the flight that the issue was about you shouldn’t be in business. I don’t understand how this airline even functions, I am out the money for my flight with no time to rebook and no assistance from the airline. I will never fly them again. You will not save money. Your problems from flying this airline will cost you more than booking with someone else. If you need a budget airline try frontier or spirit not much better but they’ll at least answer the phone when you call and try to resolve your issue. If i could give 0 stars I would.

### "customer service is an absolute joke"
Not Verified |  4 hours and 35 minutes on hold for an issue that was resolved within two minutes. I drove up to the airport to resolve the issue and no one was at the kiosk. Their “customer service” is an absolute joke.

### "Allegiant has cancelled the flight out to Bellingham"
Not Verified |  Our family of five booked our flights on Allegiant from Oakland to Bellingham to bury the ashes of my father-in-law. About two weeks before the trip, our return flight was cancelled. We scrambled around, changed our plans to find and book a flight back on Alaska. Now less than two weeks from our planned trip, Allegiant has cancelled the flight out to Bellingham. What's the use of booking a flight, if they're going to cancel it at their whim?

### "never fly Allegiant airlines again"
Not Verified |  I was supposed to fly out this morning from Los Angeles to Des Moines and Was at the airport an hour and a 1/2 before our flight was to leave. We stood in line to check in for 30 minutes and then when we got upstairs to TSA, Our boarding passes would not Scan. We had to go back down to stand in the line again to get our boarding passes printed out and by that time at time we had 30 minutes to make our flight and they wouldn't allow us to try and make it. They told us that we wouldn't be able to make the flights so we needed to call customer service and make other arrangements. We had almost 40 minutes to make it To the gate and the representative just told me to call customer service and figure out another flight. Of course now they won't clutter won't credit me any of the money I've bought my tickets with because supposedly it was my fault that we missed the plane. Why have us check in online if the barcodes won't be read at TSA? Why wouldn't they let us go try to make a flight? I will never fly Allegiant airlines again!

### "I will never fly Allegiant again"
Not Verified |  The worst ever. Canceled flights. Never received a refund two weeks later. Looks like they gave me a flight credit rather than a refund. Two weeks I've been trying to speak to someone. I've been on hold from 2-4 hours a day until I give up. I will never fly Allegiant again.

### "This airline is cheap for a reason"
Not Verified |  This airline is cheap for a reason. Terrible customer service and random cancelations. We had a flight from LAX to Reno and they just cancel it without any reason as to why it was canceled, so when we tried to call them all their phone lines are busy or not working. This company is a disgrace and should go down under. They never even helped us refund our flight, just get a voucher, which they still haven't replied about.

### "By far the worst experience"
I was given a notice two days before my flight that my flight had been cancelled. I was willing to drive to another city, but Allegiant cancelled those flights too. I tried to rebook online but their website is glitched. I called Allegiant and was on hold for 7 and 1/2 hours and then they hung up on me before I even got to speak. I have not received a refund from them. I had to book a flight with a different airline out of an airport 8 hours away from where I live. I am now out money and have heard nothing from Allegiant. I have emailed them multiple times and have heard nothing. By far the worst experience I have ever had with any airline. I need my cancelled flight refunded to my original payment. I will never be flying Allegiant again.

### "the worst airline ever"
This is the worst airline ever. Please do not let the “low costs” make you use them. Allegiant Airlines delayed my daughters’ and I’s flight multiple times in the 3 hours leading up to the flight, then finally cancelled in and rescheduled it for the next morning. The very next morning the flight got delayed two more times. My husband was supposed to be meeting us on Thursday night using Allegiant and they once again delayed his flight multiple times. 5 minutes after his flight was supposed to leave they announced that it was cancelled and they would not be rescheduling or refunding the trip. They are blaming weather but what it amounted to was that there was a crew change in another city which put them behind schedule and ended up pushing my husbands flight time during a storm. You try and call customer service and it’s a 2+ hour wait to speak to anyone. AWFUL airline. Do not waste your time or money on them.

### "try to keep the money I paid"
They cancelled my flight 10 days before. They try to keep the money I paid. Instead of having me wait on the phone for over an hour in order to cancel! Prior to calling, I was calling approximately 20 times. The phone line is always busy. There's no human who can take your call. I prepared my two confirmation numbers and the woman on the phone told me she needed the itinerary #s instead and told me to call back. Eventually, she was able to look up my itinerary using my phone number. She didn't ask for my phone number as an option instead wanting to hang up on me after I had wasted 2 hours of my precious time.

### "not be flying with Allegiant again"
After cancelling my flight just a few hours before it was supposed to depart, I couldn't even dial into their customer support line. After a half hour of dialing, I finally got through and waited on hold for 2 more hours. First of all, they couldn't even tell me why my flight was cancelled. Then they went on to tell me me they couldn't help me reschedule my flight, even from another airport and I was forced to miss my sister's bachelorette party. I will not be flying with Allegiant again.

### "was the worst travel experience"
I have flown all the major airlines for over the past 20 years. This was the first and list flight with Allegiant because they are cheap to Punta Gorda. Well you get what you pay for. They tout a sub-$100 flight however after all their fees, two round-trip tickets with carry-ons totaled $580. Other airline non-stops were the same price after all the nickel and diming from these clowns. Anyway, our flight was delayed 4 times. As we're driving to the airport, we kept getting notifications that the flight could move to an earlier time or delay further. After we board the plane, we see that the exit row seats we paid extra for were narrower than the other seats and the dividers could not be raised. We sat there for two hours while the pilot and co-pilot ran in and out of the plane trying to get a fuel pump to work. After two hours on the tarmac we finally take off for a 2:14A arrival time in Punta Gorda FL. During those two hours, not a single complimentary drink or snack was offered. They then came around and if you had their rewards card you could get a free soda. Otherwise you had to pay for a drink or snack. Without equivocation or hesitation I can easily say this was the worst travel experience in the last 25 years. I do not recommend this airline despite their touted savings. You WILL end up paying for it in in the end either monetarily, with delays, or discomfort.

### "phone number has been busy for 5 hours"
Not Verified |  Allegiant cancelled my flights less than two weeks before scheduled departure. Just a text message and an email, and no reasons given for the cancellations. The phone number to call for help has been busy for 5 hours!

### "Mask wearing is supposedly required but certainly not enforced"
Not Verified |  Mask wearing is supposedly required but certainly not enforced. Many passengers had masks down over their mouths but not noses and after some heavy turbulence, about half the passengers I saw just took their masks off or wore them under their chins. The plane was filthy and old.

### "I will never fly with you again"
I have never flown with someone who made every single aspect of the trip miserable. The people on my flight here were rude. The seat was uncomfortable. There was no space to hold anything. My flight is leaving late. They wanted to charge me $5 to get a ticket even though I wasn’t able to check in online because of them. I don’t want your app on my phone, and I was told that it would be even more difficult to use the website. You charge for a water even. Horrible. I will never fly with you again.

### "Worst experience I've ever had"
Not Verified |  Worst experience I've ever had and the worst service with the nastiest flight agent. I never got onto the flight because of everything they put me through and all the hidden and extra fees they add on at the last minute almost giving you no choice. The best part about all of that is the fact that I canceled the Allegiant flight went right over to Delta saved over $200 flying comfort class with Delta They had the best customer service the flight stewardess the flight attendants even the captain was wonderful. With delta so save yourself the headache the money and the aggravation.

### "never had a good experience with this airline"
Not Verified |  No staff and the few they have are so rude. Flights cancelled due to "weather", after 11+ hours in an airport with kids bc they promised the flight isn't cancelled (our plane was on the ground). Pilot even stated there is no weather and why aren't we leaving. People waiting 4 hrs to check a bag? Then to cancel and say it's weather related leaving 4 flights stranded in an airport and not have to compensate for over night expenses? Not worth the savings ever! We have never had a good experience with this airline!

### "a terrible experience"
Absolutely a terrible experience! I had booked a round trip flight with a hotel and rental car all through the airline. My outbound flight was canceled at the last minute with no option to reschedule. They didn’t offer anything at all to compensate for the loss. I had to rebook through a different airline and reschedule my wedding, loss of vacation days so much time and money. They could not make it anymore inconvenient and just terrible. I could never recommend them to anyone. Total nightmare.

### "the lack of cleaning"
Not Verified |  Allegiant is a "no frills" airlines which is definitely noticeable. This was our first time flying Allegiant and we did set our expectations low. Thankfully we did. First and foremost, let me say that no matter which airline you fly, the flight attendants should be welcoming and friendly. They were far from that on our flights. Don't bother to say hello because they will look through you. Secondly is the lack of cleaning. Allegiant wants to get their planes back in the air as quickly as possible. In order to do this, they refuse to clean the planes in between flights. You would think in a pandemic that they would be more thoughtful in their approach to cleanliness. As far as flying Allegiant again, not for us!

### "Don't save $20 by flying this operational nightmare"
Not Verified |  They cancelled the flight because the plane was broken. They scheduled for the next day. No compensation. Rude people all along the way. I tried to help a lady in a wheelchair they abandoned. They left the next day, stranding everyone. They would not list the new secret flight in the airport. They would not put the name of the airline on a piece of paper to help people find it. They made no announcements about it. People had to go to the windows and find the plane. An hour after canceling the flight I went to their ticket counter and they would give me nothing even though the cancelation was their fault. They would not say why. Don't save $20 by flying this operational nightmare. Their seats are smaller than Frontier. Planes are filthy. Food served is stale and past exp date.

### "We will never book Allegiant ever again"
Not Verified |  Allegiant Air is the worst. Our original flight was delayed a few weeks out (understandable), but come the day of the flight it kept getting pushed back later and later which would have caused us to miss the pickup window for the camper we had planned to rent out of Denver. We tried calling the customer service number - it was always busy. We tried chatting online, there was no one to help us. We tried emailing - 2 weeks later we never got a response back. We had to be across the state the next day so the late flight wasn't an option. We ended up booking last minute with Delta and regret not booking with them in the first place. We will never book Allegiant ever again and will tell all of our friends about their horrible customer service. I understand that flights can be non-refundable, but at-least have someone answer the phone to tell me that.

### "never had such an awful experience"
Not Verified |  I have never had such an awful experience with an airline before. It is absolutely not worth to pay a few dozen dollars cheaper so an amazingly unprofessional company. My flight got canceled two hours before leaving, the customer service wait time on the phone had a two hour wait and the chat function doesn’t work. So we drove to the airport to speak to someone at the desk only to find an inexperienced attendant crying because she couldn’t help any of us. Couldn’t rebook anyone’s flights. Couldn’t give refunds. Didn’t know any policies. She promised cash vouchers besides our refunds so that people walk away from her and obviously that was a lie. Who runs this company? Management needs to take a hold of this train wreck fast

### "Never flying Allegiant again"
My first time flying Allegiant was terrible. We were suppose to go to Nashville. First the flight got delayed, and then got delayed again before getting cancelled completely. Left many many people stranded and some not being able to see injured love one’s for the last time and such. I am 16 flying with a friend who is also 16 and we payed for this trip ourselves. We also relied on getting there last night at some point. If we didn’t have a family member in town we would have been screwed also considering it wasn’t an overnight stay airport. It was cheap, but in the long run was more expensive than Delta and United. Wish we would have just went Delta and United like we normally do. It’s almost ensured that they will get you there in a timely manner and safely. Never flying Allegiant again, and I am pretty sure they lost a whole plane full of customers.

### "It's not worth the stress"
Not Verified |  The old saying, you get what you pay for couldn't be any truer when it comes to Allegiant. Our flight was cancelled an hour prior to take off. An hour! We were stranded as we were going home and the next available flight with Allegiant wasn't until two days from our original flight. They blamed the weather which was total BS. There was no other airline that cancelled flights that evening due to weather. We even checked with neighbors. Weather was fine! The flight there wasn't any better. Was supposed to take off at 7:30 pm - didn't take off until 10:30. Worthless! Got into Bozeman at 1 am. What a waste. This time it was mechanical issues. The navigation system in the plane kept turning off. My hubby and I were concerned that there was something seriously wrong with the plane. I am never booking a flight with Allegiant again. It's not worth the stress and you'll end up paying more money just to get home.

### "Absolute worst service"
Not Verified |  Absolute worst service. Flight canceled three times. Missed a family reunion. Spent over 3 hours on hold trying to get a refund. Airport hot and filthy. Not that cheap when you add baggage costs. They've canceled my flight before just as I arrived at the gate and I swore then if never use them again. I took a chance and got screwed.

### "Not fun, nor professional"
Not Verified |  Terrible experience - sat at gate prior to departure supposedly waiting on baggage. No bags were loaded for 60 minutes, while flight attendants giggled in cockpit with pilots. Not fun, nor professional.

### "cancelled our flight back home"
They say they have cheap flights but you end up paying full price anyway. If you want a drink in flight you have to pay for it and on top of that they cancelled our flight back home. They don't answer phones and we had to go buy tickets from Frontier just to get back home. I don't even like giving them one star.

### "customer service experience is very poor"
Not Verified |  Allegiant Air's customer service experience is very poor. If you attempt to contact them through their website, you fill out a form, then when you hit submit it says you are unauthorized to submit. There is a phone number, but when you dial in, it says the wait is more than 2 hours. There is no option to select to be called back. Likewise, their technology does not work well. I modified a trip on their website to change a return flight and book a hotel and rental car. The itinerary they emailed was not consistent with what I purchased.

### "No reimbursement for the inconvenience"
Not Verified |  I purchased ticket for my 11 year old granddaughter to fly from Knoxville to St. Petersburg, wwas told it was fine she just needed to bring her birth certificate and I would need to fill out paperwork showing who would be picking her up at other end. We get to airport at 4:30 AM only to be told she could not fly alone. Had to cancel her flight and pay 3 times as much so I could fly round trip with her tomorrow. No reimbursement for the inconvenience just had to change entire plan.

### "never fly this airline again"
I will never fly this airline again. Cancelled my flight to Florida 48 hours before departure. My cousin is being buried and I can't make it. Was on hold for hours and had to give up. Will get a refund. I have no interest in their credit. Never will make this mistake again

### "My feet were frozen"
First they lost my golf clubs. There is no one on site to help or answer questions and cant get thru to anyone on the phone. They have 45 days to get back via email then they can decide how to handle past that. Then on the way to Florida, the emergency was whistling and I would see air coming in. They cleared the row and asked my row if we are OK still sitting there. My feet were frozen and I could see two holes at the bottom of the door (looked like daylight). I did take a picture of this. Very disturbing.

### "They refused to bring in a replacement plane and crew"
On short notice Allegiant Air canceled my flight. Initially they said there would be a delay because a mechanic was needed. The delay expanded over 3 hours at which point the flight was canceled. They refused to bring in a replacement plane and crew. The entire treatment was not very transparent or caring and we lost half a day just sitting in the airport not to mention reclaiming our bags. By the way we booked only a few days prior and our fare was not discounted. It was ruinous of my trip and my time off. Never again will I fly out of Fort Wayne, nor will I fly Allegiant. Pathetic. Poor management.

### "extremely unnerving, stressful and unsatisfactory"
We had an extremely unnerving, stressful and unsatisfactory experience with Allegiant. We have flown with many airlines, and when a situation arises for someone to give up their seat for monetary compensation, there is never an issue. We were to fly out July 9, from Stewart International Airport on flight 2278 to Sanford, FL. The flight was overbooked. Therefore, the gate agent started by requesting 3 volunteers to be bumped for $200 cash and a rebooked flight. No one offered including us. After a few minutes the gate agent announced the offer was now $400 and a rebooking. Again we did not offer nor did anyone else. A short time after, the gate agent announced an offer of $800 and a rebooking. This offer piqued our interest and the 3 members of our party volunteered. As we walked to the gate agent, other passengers commented to us they wish they could volunteer, but couldn’t  - comments were overheard exclaiming “$800 dollars cash, that would be nice”. We arrived to the gate agent, who we later came to know was the station manager. She was overwhelmed with the amount of people trying to get on the plane and asked us to hold tight and wait to “take care of us”. When the flight was all boarded with the gate doors closed and the plane pulling away, she commenced the process of arranging our compensation. To our shock and extreme disappointment, we soon received emails containing a link to only flight credits, and not the monetary compensation we were expecting. She simply shrugged us off and said we misunderstood her and the only option was the $200 cash or the flight credits. We insisted that she call again and tell them we were told $800 and not flight credit, however after getting off the phone, she told us take it or leave it, $200 in monetary compensation or the Flight credits, even telling us that no airline would give that much as compensation. This we know for a fact not to be true, as we have had previous experiences with other airlines (American, Delta, United, Jet blue) which have offered $400, $600 even up to $1200 for giving up a seat. At this point, apparently the state trooper was called, however we were at no time violent, not swearing, not being belligerent or yelling. We were strongly defending our position for what we and all the other passengers around the gate clearly understood was offered, $800 per passenger for the 3 seats that were needed. We insisted that the manager call again and tell the office we were not satisfied with the $200, she again stated we were wrong, and that we would never get more than the $200. We told her to call again and speak to a manager, which she finally did. The result was a $400 offer which we reluctantly accepted. There was an email that was supposed to come through, and she informed us just to leave and we would receive it within 15 minutes. Our trust in the airline had been clearly damaged, so we did not wish to leave until we received the email. She left us there telling us it would come through and that she was done. She walked away and left us with the state trooper to escort us out. This is how Allegiant repays their passengers who inconvenience themselves to allow the airline to carry on with the scheduled flight, give us less money and call the police to escort us away. The offer as was understood by all present at the gate was $800, now we were stuck in NY for 3 more days until our rescheduled flight

### "Fly another airline!"
Flight was delayed, then boarding delayed once plane arrived, taxied for almost an hour, then when we finally arrived in Stockton, there was another Allegiant plane that had just arrived so we had to sit on plane! No apology or sense of hurry. I sent a complaint to Allegiant but never heard from them. I guess that’s just the way they do business. Fly another airline!

### "Arrived without incident"
Flight was delayed by a little over an hour, so it and these reviews had me nervous but after that there were no further delays, both the pilot and crew were very apologetic and actually got us there faster than estimated. Space is a bit tight but paid way less than the next airline so it wasn't an issue (for me at least). Arrived without incident and am about to board my flight back now (which is on time and has the friendliest pilot who's been chatting with us and other passengers). Overall, the delay wasn't too bad, they gave a 5 hour heads up so I wasn't even at the airport yet and the rest of the trip was comfortable!

### "Once again my expectations were correct"
Once again my expectations were correct! Every, I mean every time we fly with your airline the staff at Harrisburg International Airport are the absolute rudest! I can not fathom why these employees still have jobs. I understand that this the airline tickets are cheap, but that does not mean poor customer service every time!

### "You get what you pay for!"
Not Verified |  First and last time. You get what you pay for! 4 hour flight turned into 8 hours. One thing after another. Here we are on the return trip and now we're delayed again! I have flown all over the world. The is the worst airline ever!

### "Worst experience traveling in my 48 years"
Not Verified |  Our family will never fly Allegiant again. Delayed leaving in addition to long lines to check baggage. Once on the plane, duct tape on the overhead baggage bins and a broken bathroom. No food because “they’ve been flying all day”. Sat on the ground for two hours due to a storm. Then, sat another two hours at baggage claim because all of their workers left for the evening and didn’t finish the luggage for three of their flights. We just left the airport at 3am frustrated. Worst experience traveling in my 48 years.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
Not Verified |  The worst airline I have ever flown. Not trustworthy at all. Waited in an airport for 5 hours and then waited on the plane with no air for an extra hour and 30 minutes with no working air.

### "would not recommend airline"
Not Verified |  Airline was cancelled with no reason and no flight out for several days. We had to fly to a different airport and arrange transportation. It cost an additional $600 to get home. I would not recommend airline to anyone. Flights are often delayed or cancelled very last minute

### "Avoid this airline at all cost"
Not Verified |  Terrible experience, flight got delayed, no explanation, we boarded and were told we needed to get out of the plane again. We were supposed to arrive at 8 15 but we did not get go Fll until 1 am. Never mind on the Way to Fll to Asheville we had similar issues. Avoid this airline at all cost.

### "an intolerable experience"
Not Verified |  If you like delays and all things slow, this airline is for you. You'll enjoy multiple unexplained delays, equipment issues and staff that could be friendlier and on top of their game. Seriously though, my wife and I flew Allegiant on 7/15 and we were delayed 3 times for unknown reasons. Then, when everyone was on board and we were seemingly ready to push away from the gate, a problem with one of the tires was discovered and the plane had to be deboarded and all carry on luggage removed. This was our fourth delay of the night. Finally, everyone was back on board and each step of the process to get in the air took longer than I have ever experienced for such a small airport. Its not like we were 10th in line for take off or anything. The entire experience was very frustrating and that is not the way air travel has ever been for me before on Delta, United or AA. If you're after a stressful experience, cramped seating and less than enthusiastic Crews, this is your low cost best bet. My apologies for the sarcasm but really this was an intolerable experience unlike any other flight I have been on in my 30+ years of travel.

### "never flying Allegiant Air again"
Not Verified |  Ridiculous, problem after problem. On the departure flight it kept getting postponed 3 times with no information. Once we finally boarded, there was some sort of issue where we had to sit for nearly an hour on the plane before taking off. On the way back, it got delayed again. Once we finally arrived back home, there were no gates open!! Seriously, get your stuff together! We had to sit on the tarmac forever waiting to find a gate and deplane. I’m never flying Allegiant Air again.

### "we didn’t even have help to find other flights"
We got to the airport an hour before boarding, we were excited and ready to fly. Then on the intercom they announced that the flight was cancelled. We are a family of 4 with 2 kids. This was horrible, there was no one to help us. We had a hotel booked and had family meeting us. Now we are on our way to another airport and are flying. Not only did we not get a refund but they gave us vouchers for their airline. I will never fly Allegiant Air ever again. We had no help, it was way too stressful and put a dint in our plans and vacation. I’m extremely annoyed that we didn’t even have help to find other flights.

### "every single aspect of the Allegiant experience was awful"
Horrible, horrible, horrible in every possible way. Text messages were changing times and gates, gate agent was yelling “pay attention”. Just a disaster. First time flying as I’m Platinum with Delta and tried Allegiant. My ticket was not cheap and every single aspect of the Allegiant experience was awful.

### "Worst mistake ever"
Not Verified |  I never heard of this airline but took a chance. Worst mistake ever. They cancelled my son's return flight less than 24 hours before departure with no reason explained. Spent several hours on the phone and was not able to talk to anyone. They sent me a credit voucher for future flight which was unbelievable. I used American Express so I will get charge taken off. This airline is pathetic and I would never take a chance with them again. Thankfully, I purchased travel insurance and will get reimbursed but my son almost didn't make it back and for that reason I will never book with them again.

### "canceled our flight home"
Not Verified |  Terrible experience on both ends. They canceled our flight home with no help or assistance what so ever. My family is stuck, and now we're scrambling to find a hotel and a way home.

### "return flight had been cancelled"
Not Verified |  Our family vacation flight from Illinois to Florida was nearly perfect. However, three days into our trip and two days before we were to leave, we received a text message saying that our return flight had been cancelled with no replacement options. I spent nearly an entire day of my vacation scrambling to find another way for my family to return home, and ended up spending $800 more dollars to get home. We were able to get a refund on our original tickets, which was a relatively easy experience, but we are out $800 dollars and a day of vacation and won’t get that back.

### "Next time we’ll stick with a real airline"
First flight on Allegiant and will be our last. Airline had overbooked the flight by 6 seats. Announced at the gate that we would not board until there were 6 volunteers to accept a payout. The next flight to Austin on this airline is four days from now! Would not board. Then we boarded the plane already late. However the crew couldn’t reconcile the passenger count with “the home office”. This was another 75 minute delay. Not mechanical, not weather - a simple passenger count. Seats were awful - think grandma’s dining room chairs that force one to sit up straight. Service was grudgingly done early in the flight - even water was not complimentary. When we arrived in Austin, the terminal was like something in a banana republic. Booked this for the direct flight. Next time we’ll stick with a real airline.

### "Allegiant did not accommodate the displaced passenger"
Unfortunately this may have been our last trip to ever fly with Allegiant. On Sunday, 7/10 we were suppose to fly from Las Vegas to San Antonio. Early that morning we were notified our flight was delayed an hour, no big deal. When we get to the airport and board, we are notified we have to deboard the plane for maintenance, no big deal. However, once we are off the plane we were not given any update for about 30 minutes. Finally we are told we'll be boarding around 5.30pm. Our original delayed depart time was 3.30pm. Once we are back on the plane, we remain at the gate for about 35-40 minutes with no update. We eventually leave the gate, maybe take one lap around the airport and the pilot let's us know the computers are having issues related to the heat outside. A few minutes later, he says we cannot take this aircraft to San Antonio and all the passengers receive a notification that we'll be leaving from a different gate. Fine, no big deal. Everyone is under the impression we are changing planes and will be on our way. They ask everyone to deboard again, and wait until everyone is off to inform us that our flight has been cancelled. It is now close to 8pm, 10pm central time in Texas. There are no flights coming back to Las Vegas tonight that will be returning to Texas. Because Allegiant waited so long to call it quits, about 4 people were able to jump to another airline and get home Sunday evening. We ended up having to spend over double what we paid round trip for a Southwest flight the next morning to go one way. We were also forced to find a place to stay because Allegiant did not accommodate the displaced passengers. It was ultimately a stressful and exhausting 24 hours due to the lack of communication from the Allegiant crew on the ground. Many people may have been able to find better accommodations that were not ridiculously expensive had our flight been cancelled much earlier. After returning home, we spend over 4 hours on hold just to talk to someone about the refund process. My first and last Allegiant experience was such a let down and exceptionally disappointing across the board.

### "seats were changed to unwanted seats"
Chose and paid for seats. Then seats were changed to unwanted seats. Airline only one who could change purchased seats. Forced to double pay for seats in order to get acceptable seats. Rip off!

### "they canceled our flight at 2.30 this morning"
Not Verified |  I was trying to enjoy a nice little get away with my mom before I leave for college and so far it’s been a pretty rough start. We booked our flights with Allegiant a couple of weeks ago, this morning July 11th and we were supposed to fly out of Des Moines Iowa at 7 but they canceled our flight at 2.30 this morning, we fortunately got a flight at 1.30 in Omaha. We drove to Omaha and when we got there, there were no staff at our terminal check in. We eventually boarded and sat down and then waited an extra hour to fly out. While we were waiting we sat next down to this very nice gentleman, he had his mask on and all and took it off for food, a couple of minutes later the attendant asked for him to get off the plane and was escorted out without explanation.

### "My family and I were stranded in Florida with no way home"
Not Verified |  Do not book with this airline! Departing flight was delayed 3 hours, returning flight was cancelled with no options given as a return! My family and I were stranded in Florida with no way home. We spent one entire day of our vacation trying to find a way home! We ended up finding a return flight 2 hours away from where we flew out of. We incurred an extra $200 just in fees for last minute tickets and rental car fees above and beyond an extra $500 we had to shell out last minute for a flight home for 4 of us. Not to mention, having to find a ride home from flying in 2 hours away from where our car was at the departing Airport. My refund is now 12 days over due and no one will answer the phone at Allegiant. I've waited on hold for 2-3 hours to no avail. They owe me $460 that has yet to be refunded. I'm starting to lose my patience with this airline. As I said, do not use them and avoid this nightmare! I wish I could have them a -100 because 1 star is still being generous!

### "This airline has no respect for the military"
Not Verified |  My son has recently just graduated A.I.T in the United States Army. He was allowed to fly home for a week to celebrate. He went back to fly him, his wife and 2 children home to find out after getting to the airport right before they were to board the plane they cancelled the flight. They rescheduled him to Houston instead of Austin where his car was. They didn't let him know there were no rental cars in the Houston airport due to this COVID-19. He simply wanted a refund so he could book a flight with another airline. Only to be told that he would have to call some number that had a wait time of 3 hours. This airline has no respect for the military of the country that they half way operate in.

### "was told too bad, no refund"
Not Verified |  Tried to cancel because of a medical emergency and was told too bad, no refund. Only a credit offered as a one time consideration. They don't have flights near where I am moving to.

### "They oversold the flight"
Not Verified |  Haven't boarded our first flight with Allegiant Air and it is already chaos. They oversold the flight by 6 people and announced they will not board the plane until they have six volunteers to take a payout. This is the only flight they have at this airport today.

### "I’ll never use them again"
My husband and I fly quite often, this was the worst experience I have ever had, we waited 2 hours in line due to negligence of the lady at the counter waiting to check our bag, we missed out flight, she scanned our boarding pass said oh your flight is closed, handed us a slip of paper and said call. While my husband was on the line with customer service I was booking another flight to get to our son, thank goodness Delta has one the same day, he stayed on the line for 4 hours and someone hung up on him, I have emailed them everyday with no responses. Yes they have cheap fares, it’s not worth the headache or hassle. I’ll never use them again and advise no one else to use them.

### "do not fly with them"
Not Verified |  My flight gets delayed over two hours just for them to cancel it due to mechanical problems. I had to spend $500 on tickets from another airline just to fly today. I am still at the terminal and other flights through Allegiant are being delayed for hours as well. Save yourself some time and stress and do not fly with them.

### "entire experience is being beyond chaotic"
Not Verified |  The entire experience is being beyond chaotic. Once landing at Sioux Falls I had to wait 45 minutes in the plane. On the way back to LA, the whole claiming baggage is ridiculous. We had to wait for almost 2 hours to claim our baggage.

### "I will never fly Allegiant again"
Not Verified |  Worst airline experience I've ever had, and this is my first time flying since COVID. My flight was originally scheduled to depart 6:21pm on Friday. I paid $65 for an Uber to take me to LAX and I get there 2 hours early. With less than 2 hours to go they cancel my flight and reschedule it for the following day, Saturday at 4:21pm. I tried calling Allegiant but after almost 2 hours on hold, I finally gave up. Then on Saturday I'm on my way to LAX again, also trying to be 2 hours early and I get an alert that my flight is delayed. I'm leaving this review while stuck at the airport waiting for my delayed, rescheduled flight and I have little confidence that I'll even get on this plane today. I've now spent more money on Uber going back and forth to the airport than the cost of my plane ticket. I will never fly Allegiant again and I suggest you stay away too.

### "Wake up for my 8am flight to be cancelled"
Not Verified |  First time to book a flight with allegiant. Will be the last. Booked a flight months ago to go on vacation to Florida. Wake up for my 8am flight to be cancelled the day of. Next flight for them is next Saturday! Never again!

### "3 hour delays, possible cancellations"
Not Verified |  I live in Michigan, my kids live in Florida, have been flying to Orlando from Grand Rapids for years, also flying my kids back and fourth. 50% of the time there is an issue with Allegiant flights, but never this bad. I am done with them. 3 hour delays, possible cancellations, destination reservations needed to be canceled and no refundable. I could fly 1st class on other airlines with the lost expenses Allegiant has cost me.

### "Called numerous times and received no answer"
Not Verified |  Emailed three times in the last month never received an answer. Called numerous times and received no answer. One of those calls I was on hold for two hours. In January I needed to cancel a flight from Allentown Pennsylvania to Fort Lauderdale Florida. It was a $157 flight which I paid in September 2020. Upon trying to make another flight last month they did not credit my $157 for payment even though I had cancelled the January flight. Truly disgusted. So am I supposed to assume I am out $157?

### "unprofessional and unnecessary"
Not Verified |  The lady that checked our tickets was extremely rude which was very unprofessional and unnecessary. She didn’t even look at our tickets long enough to recognize that we had TSA precheck. There’s no reason to be so mean to 14 year old or his mother. If you don’t like your job get another one! Sincerely, thanks for making the beginning of my travel to a funeral so memorable.

### "Customer service was atrocious"
First and last time flying Allegiant. Customer service was atrocious and blatantly inconsiderate. Check-in clerks covering one check-in counter with approximately 60 to 80 people in wait for baggage check in. There is no savings in opting for this airline. Do not recommend this for any traveler!

### "zero customer service skill"
Not Verified |  These airlines have zero customer service skill and do not help at all. Flight was delayed until cancellation due to weather but was allowing other flights to land and take off. The following day the flight had an engine issue and they tried fixing it right in front of everyone’s eyes at the gate and had us waiting for almost 12 hours and only gave us an $8 food voucher when the food court cost minimum $16 for one meal. I didn’t even use it because the fine print said “accepting this, you cannot reach out to Allegiant for other issues”. They finally sent a different aircraft after being delayed overall 18 hours and ruined 2 days of my vacation. If I could give 0 stars I would!

### "Customer service impossible to get a hold of"
Not Verified | Destin airport is a joke, too small to handle tourists. Allegiant check in with bags was like a third world country. Felt like cattle. Never fly again. Customer service impossible to get a hold of.

### "never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  Delayed more than 5 times today. Flight was 2 hrs late arriving and then had toilet issue. 5 hrs later we all still waiting at the gate. A lot of young families with tired and grumpy children are having the biggest problems but it's super frustrating for all of us. Not worth the few dollars we saved. We will never fly this airline again.

### "never had an airline cancel a flight and refuse to help"
We’ve had our flight booked for weeks. We were planning on leaving at 6.45am this morning, but awoke to a message that was sent at 3am saying the flight was canceled. There was no explanation for it and there were no other flights going out today. We’ve spent hundreds of dollars for the hotel and flight there and back. Two adults having taken off a week of work where PTO is scarce. I spent 2 hours on hold with Allegiant customer service and never got to talk to a real person. After years of flying I have never had this happen. I’ve never had an airline cancel a flight and refuse to help after the fact. I will never mess around with Allegiant again, I’d rather spend a few extra hundred dollars on a reputable airline to ensure my vacation isn’t ruined before it starts!

### "Do not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  The last 4 times I’ve flown with Allegiant Air my flights been delayed. Not a 30 minute delay but multiple hours delay. This time it got delayed when we were suppose to be boarding. They delayed the flight for 2 hours and couldn’t give a reason why. The delay now is costing me a half day of PTO due to them delaying the flight. You can never rely on Allegiant to get you to your destination on time. The worst part even though they know all the flights have been delayed I don’t get a refund discount or anything. Seems like they play it off and act like it’s just normal to always have flights delayed. Very annoyed and will likely never fly with Allegiant unless I have too. Do not recommend this airline.

### "It's steadily declined in recent years"
I've been flying with this airline for years. It's steadily declined in recent years. Yesterday, 7/3/21, the flight was first delayed prior to flight time. Ok. These things are to be expected. Next, we were unable to land due to another plane being at the gate. We then waited for over an hour (around 9:30-10:45) at baggage claim. The icing on the cake was that the handle of my suitcase is broken! Completely careless!

### "worst airline in the United States"
Not Verified |  Allegiant Air is the worst airline in the United States. The have absolutely no care for passengers, even including their boarding, the cleanliness of the aircraft, the extremely tiny vinyl covered seats with very limited legroom, and normally no advance announcements of are the known conditions which delays a flight. Allegiant requires you to pay for any seat choice, and if you do not choose and pay for a seat, they will give you the worst seat to encourage you to pay for a better seat. Last year at the height of covid, on one of my flights there were 17 rows of three seats with no passengers, but in spite of that they chose a seat where the entire row including my sea was full. Talk about not caring about covid transmission, eight months before the first vaccines were available. I have an upcoming flight, and with Hurricane Elsa possibly coming close to impact my home in Fort Lauderdale, so last night July 2, 2021, I wanted to ask about changing my outgoing flight from Syracuse to July 4th, instead of July 8th, and called customer service, and after three hours and thirty minutes, was on hold, with the volume low on speaker, so I could continue to enjoy other activities, and finally just gave up, but proof of their horrible customer service. While on hold, I made three attempts to use the chat service, and each time no agents were available. Lets also not forget that Allegiant has a very substantial background of mechanical failures that delay or cancel flights. Also, many times if you have a computer, with lets say Windows 7, you cannot even book a flight, as their IT people are not intelligent enough to match any other airline in the world, where you can book online.

### "no one seems to be available for a live chat"
I'm trying get reimbursed for for checking in bags for 4 flights I booked weeks prior. Unbeknownst to me, checking in bags are free for veterans. For the past week after returning, I've tried multiple times to get a hold of someone that may be able to help. So far, their number always seems to be busy, no one seems to be available for a live chat, and all 3 of my emails have not been responded to. I get that I made the mistake. However 2 gate agents have told me to contact Allegiant and they will gladly work with me to get refunded. Doesn't appear to happen anytime soon, so I'll just write a review to warn of Allegiants lack of customer support.

### "pathetic excuse for an airline"
Not Verified |  Absolutely pathetic excuse for an airline, this is my first time flying with this airline. They are cheap, which should have been the first red flag, but I guess you get what you pay for. Boarding started an hour late. No announcement as to why. No communication. No one was even at the desk. After an hour late, we finally boarded. Keep in mind this is July 2021 coming off a pandemic. I go to my seat, and there was half-eaten cookie/pretzels all over the seats and floor in front of us. No one vacuumed or sanitized between flights. When brought to the attention of the flight attendant to see if i could switch seats, she just said "sorry, it's a full flight. did not offer to help clean anything up or even act like she cared. So i used hand sanitizer & kleenex from my carry-on to try to clean my backrest the best i could. Spent the whole 2.5 hour flight leaning forward, with my feet in who knows what.

### "Never flying with this company again"
Not Verified |  Do not fly with Allegiant Air. Flight was scheduled for 2:22 to take off which got delayed to 4:22. Everybody boarded the plane and then the captain said we were delayed again for 6:45. Never flying with this company again.

### "Don't trust Allegiant! I will never use them again"
Not Verified |  Do not fly Allegiant! First flight was scheduled to leave June 29th, I missed my flight, my flight was leaving at 10.13am, I checked my luggage in and thought they gave me my boarding pass, went to TSA they said I didn't have a boarding pass. I'm 85 years old and don't understand very well how all this technology works, so I told them the pass is on my phone and would they help me with it, they said they couldn't and the flight already left, this all happened at 9.30 am flight boards at 9.28 and door closes at 9.58. I was marked down as a no show, but my luggage made it to Sanford. They did scheduled me to fly out the next day. I was waiting for the flight to leave then it was delayed due to weather. After several delays and several excuses the flight was canceled. I sat in McAllen Airport from 5pm until 3am. Come to find out there were no weather issues, no mechanical issues, it was because they didn't have a crew to fly the plane. Allegiant lies about everything. Now I'm trying to get my luggage back with all my medications. Don't trust Allegiant! I will never use them again. Allegiant is based out of Nevada, I guess you pay the money and take your chances!

### "unreliable, poor customer service"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline, they cancelled my flight home at 1 am by text the morning of my flight with no explanation. Had to book a return flight with American. This was a financial hardship for a family of 4. You get what you pay for, with all the extra fees you really don’t save much, the only thing assured is, unreliable, poor customer service, and uncertainty of reaching your destination.

### "Do not trust this airlines advertised rates"
Not Verified |  Do not trust this airlines advertised rates. They tacked on over $269 in additional funds which brought the total ticket and car package way over costs we thought we were going to be paying. We purposely selected this airline due to the advertised rates. We are used to honest and transparent costs with other airlines. What you book is the final cost. Not so with Allegiant. After our return of rental car, they charged us "additional fees" and did not give us a receipt with breakdown. They said it would be emailed. It was not. I have taken hours of "hold" time to speak to a representative to get a breakdown of costs and still haven't gotten through.

### "cancel within 24 hours of purchase"
First my flight was booked last minute due to a family emergency, read the terms and service saw in bold “can cancel 24 hours after purchase for a full refund” then after the fact of trying to cancel saw it said in small print “only if the flight was booked a week in advance” then tried to speak with a customer service agent and only got a busy signal, tried calling over 30 times, finally gave up, terrible customer service when I comes to speaking with an agent and terrible policy. To be fair they offer the flexible plan but that is after the terms of service say “you can cancel within 24 hours of purchase”.

### "this airline is the worst airline ever"
So I wanted to wait until my flight home to give the benefit of the doubt and I now can honestly say this airline is the worst airline ever. I have flown for 30 years and have flown every airline in the USA and most in Europe and this airline is a total joke. I see they get a 3/10 and honestly don't know how hey get that high of rating. I honestly would not fly them for free and for me that is really saying something.

### "would not recommend flying with them"
This was the worst flight I have ever dealt with. We arrived at the airport four hours prior to take off. Half of the plane ride was still in line to go through TSA. The plane delayed for a short few and then departed. Once we got through TSA we rebooked for a later flight. That flight was then cancelled. The next flight did not leave until later the next day. We had to spend the night at the airport on the floor with disabled member in our family. We chose to fly into Indy so we wouldn't have to wait until later the following day. We had to find a ride from Indy to CVG where our luggage was shipped. We spent over an extra $400 to feed the family at the airport and extra day of parking in long term at CVG. Allegiant was not accommodating at all. I would not recommend flying with them in the future!

### "No one is communicating"
Couple hundred feet before landing pilot pulls up hard to abandoned the landing. We reach maybe a thousand feet and being so low the plane is shaking. No one is communicating to us. It was terrifying. Later when the pilot finaly did talk with the passengers he spoke of a wind shift making us unable to land ... just saying some earlier communication would have appreciated. People were crying and praying, yelling requesting info, it was just a lot for a "wind shift".

### "Worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever. We have family and for the 2nd time they have cancelled their flight! Causing them to say 4 days longer and missing work! I have zero confidence in their re-schedule flight (3rd time) will take off tomorrow. It would be quicker and safer to hitchhike cross country than flying Allegiant Air.

### "What a waste of time, money, and energy, emotions"
6/28, 9pm. My daughter missed her grandma’s funeral because Allegiant told her there was a weather advisory. My daughter will be 18 in three months. The website says anyone older than 15 is considered an adult. They told her that there was a heat wave advisory for Lancaster which is in the desert not even within the vicinity of L.A it was dropped at 9pm, which was the time of her flight from Indianapolis, and since she was a minor she could not fly. The agent took her phone and went through her emails to check for confirmation, which was never sent. They laughed when she walked away. I asked if they could hire someone to accompany her as the website says but the agent told me that they didn't do that. What a waste of time, money, and energy, emotions. They told her they could reschedule in July. What a joke and very irresponsible. I tried calling but no one would answer. Horrible company. Spirit for now on.

### "you get what you pay for"
Not Verified |  Cheap flight, you get what you pay for. flight was direct. flight was pleasant. I was not happy with customer service took me three days to get through. and I only got through because I eventually just picked the Spanish option and luckily the person spoke English. Do not I repeat do not get a car rental through allegiant i asked multiple times that if i needed the car for less time than needed will i be reimbursed they said okay. i got the rental for 2 days and a half total was 250 dollars. which was fine. I only ended up using the car for 5 hours. i was still billed for 2 days and a half. please go directly to the car rental place. my bill would have only been 120.

### "Very bad customer service"
Very bad customer service. 45 minutes After everyone seated they announced that their systems are down. Due to that they manually count all passengers. It took an hour to count all the passengers. 85% of passengers were very tired and started calling for just “water”. The flight attendant got bad and started responding rudely to some of the passengers. However, no water was provided. They did not allow anyone to get out of the flight to buy food, according to the flight attendants if you step out you can not return to the flight. However, we did not have any knowledge of when the flight will be ready to depart. The departure time was 5:05 pm we stayed with terrible services with no water till 7: 50pm

### "the worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever. Paid 170 for bag and early preboard. An hour in heat and sun before got inside to wait 2 hours to check a bag. Then flight delayed, get on plane and broke so had to get off and wait hours for new one! Then no priority boarding. Do not pay that $170 extra but would highly recommend not to fly this airline it is the worst airline ever.

### "I can not believe this company"
Not Verified |  
I had to get an emergency flight to my Mom because she broke her hip and needed me to take care of her. I booked a flight with Allegiant Air and within 10 min. of booking the flight I realized I had booked a flight in the middle of the night and thought it was an afternoon flight. I cancelled that flight within 10 min. of booking it. I had to book with another airline to get to my Mom in a time so I could be picked up by family. I called the customer service line several times and they never answered...in fact the customer service line doesn't even go through, it just rings a few times and hangs up. I had to look up their corporate office number and have them connect me. They refuse to give me my money back! $195.00 for a mistake that was realized within 10 min. Of booking! I can not believe this company. I do not fly often about every 5 years or so. They refuse to give me a refund for a flight reservation that was canceled with 10 min. of making it. What a despicable company!

### "Never did get anyone to help us"
Not Verified |  Most uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in. Had a family emergency and needed to rebook, called the help line over 20 times and spent over an hour on hold. Virtual chat also too busy to answer. Never did get anyone to help us. I will never fly this airline again.

### "flight crew were very informative"
Not Verified |  In June we flew from Tri Cities to Orlando Sanford. The aircraft was very clean and comfortable and the equipment was more than expected. The flight crew were very informative. They were nice and caring and went beyond the call of their duties. We rode flight 2240 outbound and then on our return trip we rode 2247 back to Tri Cities. On both flights I will give the all a 10+ for their service and commitment. It was our first flight with Allegiant and we look forward to many many more to come. Keep up the good work Allegiant.

### "should be ashamed and embarrassed"
Allegiant Air did absolutely nothing well. The level of organizational ineptitude is indescribable. But I'm not sure what was worse, the abysmally poor communication during the debacle that was flight #1733 from Concord to Fort Lauderdale on June 20 that finally departed on June 21 or the entitled school marm attitude of their flight attendants. I guess I would go with the poor communication. They had to know that the flight was going to be canceled at the time they sent out the delay message. FAA regulations dictated that decision and a second grade math skill level would have let you know you were going to exceed the pilot flight time limitation. And the staff handling of the situation and lack of communication during the episode was so bad that it deserves to be in case studies on how NOT to handle that situation. The staff failed at every level. They should be ashamed and embarrassed. Absolutely disgusting, disgraceful, and disappointing.

### "couldn’t of imagined an airline this bad"
The worst airline experience possible. Rude customer service and it’s extremely slow. Tried to check my bags in 2 hours early, they said wait 30 minutes and after 10 minutes the line was to the back of the airport. Had two people working. Honestly couldn’t of imagined an airline this bad.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Stay away! By far the worst airline out there. Flight was delayed multiple times (both ways) then ultimately cancelled after the terminal was told “the crew is exhausted.” Save your money. Not worth the discount. Pathetic. Keep your voucher.

### "will never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  First Flight we took a flight from Belleville to Destin after the plane was already 1hr late,the plane broke down at the Airport. They called a Mechanic from STL Lambert to fix the plane. 4 hr delay! After we landed in Destin they kept us waiting in the plane for another 45 min because they didn’t clear a dock. On our way back our flight got delayed by another 4 hrs. This airline is the worst and will never fly with them again, I rather drive.

### "doesn’t care about families"
They loaded up the plane then made us wait 2 hours on the tarmac claiming a latch was loose. They didn’t know this before they loaded the plane? They handed out a tiny bag of pretzels as compensation, I asked if I could have a second bag and they said no. I was supposed to arrive at my destination around 6:45pm but unfortunately we arrived at the gate at 8:45pm and was starving. Most sketchy Airline, even worse traveling with kids who are tired and hungry as well but apparently this airline doesn’t care about families.

### "What’s going on with customer service"
Tried to book my flight to go pick up my minor daughter that was visiting with family. I booked our flights separately since I was a round trip and she was a 1 way to have the issue of not being able to successfully book her flight because she was a minor. I instantly after numerous tries of trying to book her flight got on the phone and live chat and was not able to reach customer service for help in booking her flight successfully, then live chat wasted my time and said my only option was to get through by phone to add her to my return flight. Moving forward 5 days, multiple phone calls and a ton of wasted hours with no success of getting a human on the phone I had to drive an hour to the airport to confirm I wasn’t loosing money, to be told I would be paying an extra $200 and that there was no other options. I’m severely turned off and will never fly this airline ever again! What’s going on with customer service, all around disgusted. Fly Delta or any other airline. Good luck getting through to a human to try and adjust anything with your travels.

### "customer service was definitely very poor"
Not Verified |  Our flight from Lexington KY was cancelled 3 hrs prior to set time departure, our only option was a flight leaving from Cincinnati at 6.48pm, where we had just driven from, then that flight gets delayed 2 hours due to “maintenance.” Now the scheduled time was 8.48pm. New crew had to be called in delaying it again til 9.30. One called in sick cancelling the flight after we had waited 8 hrs to make sure it’s all good. Last chance was the next morning at 8am. All was finally well with this departure until we arrived to Destin and now have waited over an hour to even pick up our luggage. On top of it customer service was definitely very poor all around at the airport.

### "poor customer service no excuse"
My flight was canceled. Not the complaint because I would rather be safe than sorry. But then you give an incentive card that won’t load. So I sit on hold with customer service for over two hours while no one ever answers. Try live chat and no one is available. Send a email and no one responds. Like I said I can handle the cancellation but poor customer service no excuse!

### "Multiple issues with this flight"
Multiple issues with this flight: First notification of a delay (6.30am to 8.45am) was sent only two hours before the flight. Of course, we were already through security at that time. Had to wait around at the gate. Finally started boarding at 8.00am. The boarding process was chaotic with anyone lining up and boarding regardless of Zone. I was in Zone 2 and 2/3 of the plane was already in line and boarded ahead of me. Apparently there was an issue with the pilot and they had to call another pilot to come in. He lives across the state and wouldn’t be at the plane for an hour and a half after our delayed departure time. They boarded everyone regardless (they knew of the issue) and had us sit on the plane two more hours waiting for a new pilot. Horrible.

### "They don't care about their customers whatsoever"
I have been sitting in this airport for 7 hours now with no updates, no apologies, no vouchers. Everyone in this airport is extremely upset and we have only been told that there was mechanical issues and it would be an hour delay. Then delayed 2 more times. They said they are sending a plane from Florida and come to find out it wasn't even in the air yet. They said they can't do anything and we will have to call customer service. I've been on hold for 1 hour and hung up on once before after waiting 45 min the first time. They don't care about their customers whatsoever. Kids are crying, people are missing their rides, and we need to go to work in the morning. After people asked to speak to a manager calmly, the one and only employee in this airport called the police. They were nicer and more informative than he was! Ridiculous, rude and costing us time money and suffering.

### "compete absence of communication"
Not Verified |  Horrible management of passenger loading in Austin. Staff can not give passengers any information on loading time. Very poor management of a late flight making the situation much worse than it needed to be. No consideration to help passengers social distance due to compete absence of communication.

### "excuse after excuse and apology after apology"
Not Verified |  They dropped the size of the airplane leaving the flight overbooked on a smaller airplane. Offering $300 then $400 voucher for another flight (until they told people when their next flight was and that was 4 days later) (A) Don’t stop start boarding the plane if your going to stop it because you want to continue to offer the same amount to people over and over and over. (B) Common sense would say to put someone on another plane as another option at the same time so you would have to pay the voucher on top of that! But you offered the voucher, then those that accepted you tried to negotiate giving them less of a voucher while everyone is sitting waiting to board and leave! (Now 20 minutes behind schedule) a gentleman disrespects a lady, he was acknowledged and spoken to by an employee yet you let him board the plane? Yet again no common sense! You allow us all to sit 30 more minutes on the plane and yup take that guy off the plane! (50 minutes behind schedule) Finally get rolling but we are second in line and 1 hour behind schedule we are in the air! Instead of being cheap and not using a brain you will lose several people from this flight as I personally came into Florida with 7 others on this flight for a poker tournament. Not that we personally need anything nor wanted anything, the fact nothing (not even a dam bottle of water was offered) just a dragged out apology and excuse after excuse and apology after apology, when it only would have taken was commonsense. This company blows my mind and that was the last straw and a disgusting display of business!

### "It's not worth it at all. Just spend the money"
Not Verified |  If you're here you're probably considering using Allegiant to save some money on your next trip. Nope. Don't do it. Don't cheap out. All of the negative press is real. There is quite literally a "60-Minutes" documentary episode on how bad Allegiant Air is. Their booking systems are a mess. There were four attendants checking people in, all four of the people in front of us had separate issues they couldn't resolve. The return flights were all canceled the morning of stranding us there. Not a drop of rain or bad weather at either airport. We later found out all Allegiant Air from that and connecting airports seemingly randomly canceled. When we arrived at an airport someone who knew told us their tech systems had totally failed or something and that it was a common occurrence. We got a refund of a tiny fraction of the cost of our tickets (legal?). In order to receive the refund we needed to use a sketchy third party website and enter our full bank routing information (feel confident about giving them your full bank into after all I mentioned?). We ended up driving back home 800+ miles, entertaining ourselves with news stories about how Allegiant Air screwed over customers. And what's crazy is that we were home long before our content ran out. Anyways - back to you. You're looking at saving $250-$350 vs Delta or American or something. Don't do it. It's not worth it at all. Just spend the money.

### "horrible experience with Allegiant"
I had a horrible experience with Allegiant. My flight was at 3:08 on June 5, I arrive at the gate after checking me, my brother, my son, and our pet puppy in once at the gate their was this lady there who stated that I can’t get on last minute because the dog was on a hard sided cage where on the websites it’s said both is okay and I spend 2 hour on the phone the previous day to get a representation on the phone to add the dog and was also told it was okay. She had no sympathy she gave me short blunt answers and didn’t even offer a alternative or a apology once I ask her what I can do she stated I can purchase the soft sides one but she’s closing the gate. Before this whole incident happen I spoke to her before where she saw the dog in the cage and didn’t say nothing and when the incident happen I ask to speak to higher up since she was a supervisor but she said there’s no one else I can speak to. Long story short I was denied access on the plane and my sister had to drive 1:39 min back to come get me to go home. Allegiant pet policy All pets must be transported in a soft-sided or hard-sided enclosed leak-proof carrier

### "straight up cancelled the flight"
Not Verified |  I drove to Ft Lauderdale for my Allegiant flight. Initially they delayed my flight for 2 hours then straight up cancelled the flight. I noticed a pattern with Allegiant. Just before they cancel a flight, all workers disappear so you have no one to talk to. I called their 800 number and they told me there would be a flight out of an airport 3 hours away at 6am the next morning. I drove the three hours and at 5am, the workers all disappeared. A moment later, the flight was cancelled. This is the second time they have cancelled my weekend trip to see my grandkids. Their cheap flights aren't worth the headache of cancelations.

### "a lot of hidden prices"
Supposed to arrive at our destination at 6:55pm. Instead we arrived at 9pm. The snack cart came through it was Ball park Stadium prices. Be prepared, you definitely get what you pay for, a lot of hidden prices with this airline.

### "Everything has a $ with Allegiant"
Not Verified |  Everything has a $ with Allegiant. Asked Male flight attendant for a little assistance with bag. Told if I can’t handle should have paid more for check below. Will prefer to drive this route than every take a greedy airline like this again. Guess financial investment in port Charlotte is hurting this airline.

### "Horrible customer service"
Out of all the airlines I have used (Spirit, Southwest, Frontier, Delta, American and JetBlue) I have never had a worse experience. Horrible customer service, delayed flight and small plane. The workers at Niagara Falls were disrespectful and not helpful. Staff are not welcoming and talk back when dealing with complaints. I will never use this airline ever again (there are plenty of better options that are just as affordable). Also you have to pay for every little thing, you’re nickel and dimed over everything (which most cheap airlines do). My bag was okay and a few others but my fiancé’s wasn’t even though I have used it since I was 10 on flights before!

### "costly and just total abandonment"
Not Verified |  They cancelled our flight on Thursday and said they were not rescheduling the flight and that we could rebook on their next flight for Sunday! They offered no hotel/food voucher. They did not help with luggage transfer or information for other flights. We had to last minute book with Southwest which was expensive last minute. It was costly and just total abandonment. Do yourself a favor and book Southwest the first time around! It will save you more in the end!

### "waiting in the airport for 12 hours"
We have been waiting in the airport for 12 hours because one lightbulb on the plane didn’t work. Boarded and deplaned twice. All we were given was an $8 meal voucher (valid at one singular restaurant). Never again.

### "bag was 43 pounds and they made me pay $100"
Not Verified |  The staff is so rude. Just spend the extra money and fly with a more personable staff! I asked to switch to an empty row right in front of me (after the doors closed) and was told no! I was taking a work phone call prior to takeoff and the male flight attendant told me to get off of the phone as if he has speaking to his child. They nickel and dime you for everything. We paid so much in baggage fees that it was ridiculous. Not to mention they are the only airline who has a 40 pound bag limit - my bag was 43 pounds and they made me pay $100.

### "I've never been so dissatisfied ever while flying"
I've been flying Allegiant for 6 years down to Florida to visit family! I bring my backpack plus a cross over wallet not even a purse I mean a wallet. They tried making me pay 50.00 for something that fits in my pocket. Pathetic! Not to mention the ladies were quite rude. Also they put my kids car seat "small booster seat" on someone else's walker yet everyone is so concerned about covid and wanting to take precautions per them not me like they care so much but let's throw your child's booster on someone's walker. I've never been so dissatisfied ever while flying. My family and I will not be traveling Allegiant any further, there's 11 of us every time and we will be going elsewhere. When we left Flint we had zero issues but leaving Florida was sickening.

### "problem was the customer service portion"
Not Verified |  The flight down to Florida was acceptable without incident. The flight crew were courteous and proficient. The problem was the customer service portion. I am a veteran and the airline claims military courtesy for luggage cost which is all well, but if you get charged and try calling the customer care number for reimbursement you can forget about getting through. I have called 4 times and the wait times have been anywhere from 25 to 40 minutes without a response. It appears the number given is going to a dead line.

### "flight attendant was very rude"
The flight attendant was very rude, I was very sick due to motion sickness. I asked the flight attendant, whom was sitting on her cell phone, in the back of the plane, doing absolutely nothing, if I could find a seat closer to the front of the plane. She asked me to pull up my mask as I continued to throw up, Im not sure how this is possible, but what do I know? She rudely informed me to sit in my seat and that nothing could be done to help me. I found this extremely inconsiderate being that other passengers were trying to help me, by giving me bags to throw up in, yet she did nothing but sit on her butt and scroll instagram. Perhaps simply getting off your phone and doing your job would be sufficient, rather than leaving a passenger on the floor of the plane throwing up.

### "Absolutely terrible experience"
Not Verified |  Absolutely terrible experience. I recommend everyone avoid Allegiant at all cost. Allegiant canceled our flight with no rescheduled flight for 4 days. We rented a car and drove 3 other people from our flight home. After a month of trying to reach out to Allegiant I had to Facebook message them to get a response! They are not reimbursing us for the cost of the car and only providing a voucher for the flight instead of a reimbursement. Customer service staff were terrible.

### "Staff were borderline rude"
The absolute the worst flight I have ever had. Will never fly in this terrible airline that nickles and dimes you to death. The seats are uncomfortable, the delay going was an hour, coming home was 4 hours, vouchers given were not accepted for food in the airport. Turbulence was terrible. Staff were borderline rude. Spend the money and go to Southwest or any other airline.

### "This was the very worst"
Not Verified |  Never fly this 1.5 hrs after touching ground I still did not have my luggage I called customer support to deal with all types of ghetto. This was on top of being delayed 40 mins and not being able to find anyone at my gate and than landing and waiting a extra hour for them to find a gate to let us out at. This was the very worst.

### "proceeded to remove me from the plane"
Was harassed by flight attendant as soon as I got on the plane about my mask with a filter on it told me that wasn’t a regulation mask. I proceeded to tell her that if the mask that you’re wearing can see light through it that the virus can pass through it. I said that on my seat proceeded to open up my yogurt to eat it I was done harassed about not wearing a mask then they sent somebody over there to tell me to put a mask on even though I was eating. He returned to the plane saying that I was asked to be removed being that I was disruptive and not following the rules even though I was eating they still proceeded to remove me from the plane and told me that it’s because I was being disruptive and causing people to be unsafe. The person trying to remove me from the plane was not wearing a mask properly, the irony of the situation is just unreal, Horrible flight service, horrible flight attendants, never recommend this airline to anybody

### "getting worse and worse"
I fly Allegiant often and because each experience is getting worse and worse I’m going to start reviewing each flight. Last week I flew allegiant from lit to sfb and got to spend an entire sunny day stuck inside an airport for a 12 hour delay. Today, a week later, I’m sitting on the runway writing this. Been here for an hour past departure so far. The plane is half empty and I am crammed in a row with two other people. After seeing some fellow passengers move to other seats to allow for possible social distancing, I proceeded to do the same. The whole row at the back of the plane had no one in it. I made my way back to it (2 rows behind my current position mind you) and was met with the most rude female flight attendant I’ve ever experienced who would not allow me to take one of the many empty seats to give myself and other passengers social distance. A very disrespectful person. Unfortunately I’ll be flying this airline again, but I’ll be sure to review each flight to bring awareness to “you get what you pay for” I guess it’s too much to ask for a flight attendant who can respectfully communicate or for a reliable flight schedule.

### "None wearing masks"
Unruly passengers in the terminal group of about 10. None wearing masks. They were then allowed to board flight and did not wear masks. It took at least 5 people close to where I was sitting to complain to stewards before the asked passengers to wear masks. Passengers continued to ignore them. Pilots announced it. Passengers allowed to leave plane with no consequences.

### "pay for every piece of luggage"
First off I purchased the ticket not knowing you have to pay for every piece of luggage, the cost does not even cover 1 checked baggage. You would be better off buying from the other airlines because if you have to pay for luggage you will end up spending twice the amount. I paid $270 for the ticket and the baggage cost me another $140, I found tickets for another airline for $325 and I know that covers a checked bag. I only checked 1 bag instead of 2 and now the airline wants to only give me a credit for the difference when the girl at the counter told me that I could call customer service and they could issue a refund. I called customer service and they told me credit only for my next flight, well they charge for drinks and snacks, even water, there is no on-flight entertainment, and their staff is not friendly. Why would I even fly with you again. No I do not want a credit because I would never use your airline.

### "I just want to use my promo"
Not Verified |  TSA and check gate employees were rude - even to elderly passengers and veterans! Terrible. Also, I'm currently trying to book a flight for a friend using my promo code from Allegiant in my email. Flight dates align with promo requirements, it's good until midnight tonight, and no destinations are mentioned in promo details. Yet, the Allegiant site says it's expired! Called the number for Allegiant and had a rude rep answer. Called a different number and have been on hold for 35 minutes! I just want to use my promo .. went ahead and purchased the flight, writing this while on hold, and will ask where else to leave a bad review.

### "I wasted more money and time by flying this airline"
Not Verified |  Awful Spokane to Las Vegas. Flight was at 2.45. Didn't leave till 5. Did role call, head count. Some people didn't even get their names called. Nobody knew what was going on. Rescheduled 4 different times. Even the pilot came out and asked what they were doing. The airport staff even said, "what are you doing?, we checked in all 120". The lady that checked in from the terminal didn't even check how many people were with us. Literally anyone could have just gone on the plane with us. Sat on plane for over an hour. Be careful with budget airlines. It bites back and we lost our time and the tickets I bought for a show in Vegas are non refundable. I wasted more money and time by flying this airline.

### "They rescheduled our flight for 27 hours later"
Not Verified |  On a Saturday night we were booked to go to Florida from Fort Wayne, IN. The incoming flight had turbulence and a flight attendant injured her leg. After waiting a couple of hours, they cancelled our flight. They rescheduled our flight for 27 hours later on Sunday evening. After waiting a long time, we finally got our luggage back. They had assigned one college aged girl to take care of all of us with the new flight and the luggage. We found an early Sunday morning flight in Grand Rapids, MI so we drove 3 hours there and got a hotel and flew out early Sunday. Our loss was one night of payment on our Florida condo as well as a whole day of our vacation. Our gas money to Grand Rapids and the hotel in Grand Rapids. Allegiant says it's not their fault and we can't get refunded for anything. I would be happy if they would at least pay for our hotel. Now I understand why all the people in the line were saying "Allegiant has done this before, but this is the last time. I won't fly Allegiant again".

### "never book a flight with Allegiant again"
Not Verified |  I can't say enough bad things about this airline. How they still operate is beyond me. They delayed my flight multiple times making me leave at 1140 pm. I called customer service and after waiting 30 minutes was greeted by a very rude and condescending woman. I asked her if the flight was going to cancelled or if they will still flying at almost midnight. She was not helpful and told me they'll fly even if it's 3 in the morning or else I'll have to take the next flight in 1 week! I originally paid extra for the very front row seats and they ended up changing and moving me back with no explanation and no price adjustment. At approximately 854pm I was notified that our flight was now leaving at 1000pm. I hopped in my truck and booked it to the airport (25 mins away). I was already checked in and only bringing a carry-on so I ran to my gate. I arrived there at 935 and guess what? The plane wasn't even there yet! I will never book a flight with Allegiant again. They advertise low prices but by the time you pay for seat selection and fees, you pay just as much as other airlines that operate at a professional level.

### "Complete nightmare. Never use them"
Not Verified |  It took 40 minutes on the phone to book. Could not understand the agent and the process was so complicated. Drove 3 hours to the airport to find the trip canceled and they had no other options. They could not work with other airlines to book me because they have no relationships with any. Complete nightmare. Never use them.

### "Check in was a nightmare"
Not Verified |  Very upsetting with their customer service. Everyone in the Orlando airport was extremely rude. Check in was a nightmare causing us to miss our flight along with 20 other people going to different destinations. I will never fly Allegiant again nor will I ever recommend them.

### "They are never consistent with anything"
Not Verified |  Horrible Airline. Stay away at all costs. They will cancel flights to merge flights so they can fill the plane. They are never consistent with anything.

### "I have never had such an unacceptable experience"
I have never had such an unacceptable experience. My spouse and I are teachers and wanted to travel on spring break, from Chicago to Asheville. Spring break is only a week long. They cancelled our flight and only offered another one four days later, impossible on spring break of only 7 days. Our vacation, after finally getting vaccinated and teaching remotely for a year, was ruined. They offered a refund, which was nice - I suppose, but we lost our vacation. They wouldn’t rebook us on another airline, and had no other options other than leaving days later. If you want to get somewhere on a specific date and time, avoid this airline. Here I sit - at home, when I should be on a vacation I spent hours planning and paying for.

### "Don't bother with this airline"
Don't bother with this airline. Their low rates very quickly go away as soon as you want any bags, to pick a seat, even to get water during your flight. They literally charge for everything. Additionally, I booked a package deal with them and yet was charged by the rental car company and the hotel in addition to the package price I already had paid. Additionally, it is obvious they don't clean their planes between flights. That's bad enough in a normal environment. But completely inexcusable as we deal with COVID. They should be ashamed of themselves. And no one should ever fly this airline. Additionally, no one responds to e-mails or online chats or picks up the customer service phone.

### "plane was not disinfected or sanitary"
Not Verified |  The plane was not disinfected or sanitary like promised. My seat was filthy and they did nothing about it. I arrive at the airport early it was closed. I waited outside for it to open no big deal. We board the plane and about 20 minutes later start running into delays normal. We had to deplane so they could fix an issue. After about an hour of waiting for answers the intercom goes off “stop asking us questions it’s not our fault your flight is delayed if you want answers ask the flight attendants and pilots” of course they were sitting in plane when this announcement went off. About 30 minutes later they told us we will have an update in about an hour telling the status if the plane. That update didn’t come for a hour and a half. My flight was suppose to leave at 5pm now it is 9pm and they tell us our flight is cancelled and to not talk to them until after we have received our bags. We wait an HOUR to receive or bags from baggage claim by threat time the airport was closed and they didn’t have any answers for us on why the flight was canceled. Left many people stranded because there was no Uber’s or lyfts just the airport shuffle that took you to a $200 hotel a night. They didn’t even offer or give out any vouchers or discounts. I heard them tell multiple people that this is a typical thing Allegiant Air does and I even asked myself. Okay fast forward 24hours I’m back at the airport only to board a disgusting plane. It had gum in my tray and filthy area. It’s surprising because it’s COVID 19 and you didn’t disinfect or sanatize the seats before allowing people to board the plane. And getting a hold of customer service is a 5 day task they are terrible. I highly recommend flying with anyone but Allegiant, that was my first and definitely my last time. Allegiant just wants your money they don’t follow protocols.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Not Verified |  Flight will leave even when you make it on time. My bags were on the plane and I arrived at 6.40, 20 minutes before the plane was scheduled to depart at 7. A girl boarded 30 seconds before I got there. The staff were extremely unkind to me, he told me I was not able to board even though I made the flight by 20 minutes. My family was on the flight already and told them I was running late. Terrible service. My bags were on the plane, it departed with my bags still on. No refunds or apologies by anyone. I would not recommend this airline.

### "none of them was professional"
From the front desk staff at the airport to customer service answering your phone call none of them was professional on a scale 1-10 I would give them 1. I wish if I had read the reviews before I booked this flight.

### "Very poor service"
I was an hour early to the airport, had my luggage claimed then went to TSA to find out that my flight had departed. I called 3 times, first woman hung up on me, trying to act like she couldn’t hear me when she clearly shuddered twice when I spoke to her while she “couldn’t hear me”, then hung up. Second call was a supervisor, she was extremely unprofessional and hung up on me as well when I told her I was going to write a review. Then last I had a call with a staff member who was patient and tried his best to provide me information to create a claim. This flight will take your luggage and still leave without you before the flight is scheduled to take off. Very inconsiderate of their customers. They left me with no clothing and the next flight was 5 days away, they did nothing to accommodate this inconvenience. Very poor service. Literally makes me sick to my stomach since I’ve been a regular customer for years.

### "Keep up the good work!"
Not Verified |  We had a wonderful experience flying Allegiant. The best part was our flight attendant. He was entertaining and hilarious from the start of the flight to the very end. He greeted everyone personally as they boarded the plane, kept us all entertained during the flight, and he said goodbye to each and every person as they deboarded the plane, telling each us to have a blessed day. Keep up the good work!

### "accused of mask wearing compliance"
Worst flight experience we’ve ever had, St Cloud to Mesa. Rude staff and unfairly accused of mask wearing compliance. Escorted off plane by police and questioned. Reported to TSA and received a warning. No due process. Last $$$ they’ll see from us. Despicable.

### "wouldn't recommend to anyone who wants to meet a timeline"
3rd time flying this airline. Sits on the runway 15 minutes after real departure time, arrives 30 minutes after scheduled arrival time. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who wants to meet a timeline.

### "always a delay for mechanical issues"
Every time we fly there's always a delay for mechanical issues, stuck on the runway and taxied back into sit for 3 hours on a hot plane. Worst Airline possible. Yes, flights are cheap, but you get what you pay for, horrible.

### "Worst flight ever!"
Not Verified |  Worst flight ever!! I have had my seat choice, 3D, reserved for several months. Why is it when I board the plane, a. There is someone in my seat, b. I am the one that has to move and c. I’m put next to a screaming baby? The 2 front cabin flight attendants were less than helpful in trying to locate a better seat on the plane for me and there were seats available. It will be a very long time, if ever, I fly Allegiant again. And would not recommend to anyone.

### "This company is pretty terrible"
Probably the worst customer service we have experienced with an airline. We asked them to print us tickets since our online check in boarding passes werent working at TSA. They proceeded to try to get us to download an app etc. Said they could not print us tickets and we ended up not making the flight since the tickets they were pulling up werent working at TSA. We went to TSA 3 times with tickets they had pulled up. Talked with customer service at baggage claim later who said they can print tickets for $5. Again the ticket counter never offered this even though we asked for our printed tickets. This company is pretty terrible.

### "I wish I had realized how bad they were before booking"
I will never fly Allegiant again. Be warned, this airline does not care if it inconveniences you or if you actually need to arrive at a destination at a certain day and time. They are perfectly comfortable listing multiple flights and then cancelling and merging flights to maximize their bottom line at the expense of your experience. I wish I had realized how bad they were before booking, so I am warning you. I thought it was just the reality of value air travel so you have zero perks. I didn’t realize they were this unprofessional so as to cancel with no compensation or care. Cancelled my return flight a week out, rescheduled to an earlier time that removed one day of our 3 day vacation. Then they cancelled my departure flight at 1am the night before departure, only option was way late in the day so I lost the first day as well, then they delayed it again (ultimately 8 hours later than original departure time). Beware! If you have any other option, book with any other airline. Not worth any savings you may think you get. I wish I could give a zero or a negative number for this review. The fact I have to give at least a 1 feels generous.

### "The worst customer service ever"
Not Verified |  We all know that Allegiant is an economy airline. And that they charge for absolutely everything that you want, including water. I had prepaid for a carry on. When I went to get my boarding pass, they charged me $5 to print it. They saw my carry on and didn't say anything. Went through security and got ready to board. It was 2" too thick. It would have easily fit in an overhead compartment. They said I needed to pay for it to be checked. $50. I asked for a credit for what I had already paid for the carry on and I would pay the difference. She was completely rude and said Allegiant never refunds or credits. Allegiant just started flights out of Santa Maria. The plane is not even half full. With this attitude I doubt they will be here long. The worst customer service ever. Flyer be aware.

### "Fly with caution!"
Absolutely horrible business practices! The trip started with an understandable weather delay which developed into a 36 he mechanical delay because the plane was not properly maintained during the storm. Allegiant refused to recognize it as mechanical issue instead of weather despite the fact that other airlines were flying in and out in those conditions. This delay cost me an overnight stay waiting for the flight to either be fixed or a rescue plane sent. Additional cost for food as there was only one venue available and we were told to stay near the gate. I also lost money on my destination lodging which was no longer refundable or able to cancel because delays took so long. when I contacted Allegiant customer service about the issue they absolutely refused to acknowledge any wrongdoing and stated that they were not required by law to provide any kind of compensation. I recognize that there is no legal obligation but there is an obligation for the business to act in good faith towards its customers. All told, I paid $270 for the flight and an additional $250 in food and lodging expense as a result of the delay. The company refuses to do right by the situation. This is not my first go round with delays and cancellations with this company but it will be my last. Fly with caution!

### " asked about some possible and future charges"
Not Verified |  I was flying with this fly airline company due another passenger gave me this fly ticket as a gift. Before leaving from my home, I decided to call Allegiant Air's customer service, making some consult, specifically, about the laptop fly classification. Due the cheapest value of this kind of ticket, I asked about some possible and future charges at customer service. The answer was the computer doesn't have any charge at the airport front desk. Believing the information I received; I decided to use my most and loved let her and personalized computer suitcase and carry my computer in. Into the airplane, ready and waiting for departing, I saw a lady who was carrying, not only a hand suitcase, a computer suitcase plus a back bag. I was curious and I decided to ask how much she paid, not by the laptop (50,00 US$) but by the backbag. She answered me nothing.

### "I never had a problem with Allegiant"
Not Verified |  I never had a problem with Allegiant. I fly them a lot. Nice new planes and great staff. Best cheap airline I found. Some people think they have to be treated like royalty. Allegiant makes a poor boy like me feel like a king because I can afford their prices. Thumbs up.

### "hidden fees in packaged deals"
Beware hidden fees in packaged deals. They may be near the packaged deal cost. Recent experience for 4 nights additional cost $282.14 for resort fees and rental car taxes. Contact airline, hotel, car rental individually and create own package with concrete costs and fees so, no surprises.

### "forced us to pay for them in Memphis"
They’re a scam, selling cheap tickets and then charging you at the airport for things that just don’t make sense! For the same carry on bags they didn’t made us pay in Miami, they forced us to pay for them in Memphis or they wouldn’t left us go into the flight! We call to customer service and they just say they don’t trust us and that their people are always right. No words for that, just never flying with them again. A

### "My flight was cancelled!"
My flight was cancelled! I have to book with another United airline paying $500 for another flight and had to $96 uber to the Sanford airport to pick up my car! None of my extra charges was accommodated! Be wise and have extra cash if the cancel your flight as they do often!

### "Absolutely unacceptable"
Flying to New Orleans was fine. An hour before boarding in New Orleans to go back home the flight was cancelled. The customer service agent at the airport explained how much he hated this airline and that the next flight was in February and there’s nothing he could do. I’m an officer in the military and had to be home Monday AM so my only option was to rent a car and drive the 11 hours to NC. When I finally made it home close to midnight the airport had no attendants on site to receive the car so I then had to drive the car back home - in the city where I don't have additional parking available for a second vehicle. I parked the car on the street and of course, got a parking ticket for being 8 minutes late to move the car. Then today I got to drop off the rental and pay for an Uber to get back to my home. The cost of renting a car, gas, parking ticket and Uber of course isn’t covered by the company who stranded me in New Orleans. Absolutely unacceptable, I will never use this company again.

### "Worst plane service out there"
Not Verified |  The people that work are the most disrespectful people I have met. We boarded the plane and 1 hour later they tell us there's a 2 hour delay. We get back on the plane, they say its all good. 12.15 was the leave time. Still in Indianapolis at 4pm. This company need financial aid, this company need to learn how to take care of their planes and not hiring elementary graduates. The crew were laughing and eating together. Never asked us for a complimentary drink while waiting. Worst plane service out there. They don't deserve help.

### "Never again will I fly with them"
My from Allentown to Orlando Sanford flight for 7.30 am is delayed until 1pm yet again. And they never gave us a reason. Never again will I fly with them!

### "Allegiant never fails to disappoint"
Not Verified |  Allegiant never fails to disappoint. This airline is never on time and always has a delay with boarding and take off. The flight attendants are not the friendliest. If you want to waste your time sitting on a plane while they figure out passenger count, etc - then fly Allegiant. Horrible.

### "Worst airline I have ever flown on"
Worst airline I have ever flown on - the stewardess was rude and snappy! Packed in like sardines - I will never fly this airline again. Pay the extra money and fly with any other airline! Trust me.

### "Save yourself the headaches"
Not Verified |  Save yourself the headaches. Fly with anyone else. Yes this year has been crazy, but companies like this sure don't help. I was supposed to travel for work to Vegas to go to a week long professional conference. Of course had to pay out of pocket and would get reimbursed. However, here comes COVID....and of course Allegiant only offers a voucher. A voucher that says travel must be completed by February. What good does that do? Half the states they fly to from here are so locked down there is no point to even go. Been trying to get a hold of Allegiant to see if that can be extended due to the continued pandemic....not looking good. Basically out $500 because of the pandemic. Judging by the reviews, this isn't a new practice. Surprised by the number of people with 1 star reviews their business practices haven't resulted in a class action suit yet.

### "the hidden charges and surprises are endless"
Not Verified |  After standing in line for what seemed like an eternity, what I thought was a good deal turned out to be as bad as Spirit Airlines, the same nickel and dime game, the hidden charges and surprises are endless, not to mention the lower bag weight limits, uncomfortable seats, no wifi or entertainment and to top it all off ridiculous expensive snacks on board. I will never fly this airline again, I thought I was saving some money, in the end turned out to be more expensive that any other airline. I strongly recommend you find another airline to give your money to.

### "out of his way helpful and kind"
Not Verified |  I am a mother of an adult son, who’s disabled with traumatic brain injury. Just walking into the door of the airport we were greeted by staff member Pat. He was out of his way helpful and kind. All the staff members were as nice as they could be. I wish, I could remember all of their names to give them the credit they so well deserve. I put my son on the plane with full confidence he will be taking good care of. I will always fly Allegiant Air. Thank you again for treating us like family.

### "I am extremely disappointed"
My flight was scheduled to leave Cincinnati at 6:30 am as I was getting in my car with my 2 adult children to leave for the airport i got a notice that my flight was delayed by 10 hours. 10 hours? Seriously? We lost an entire day of our vacation. We had a RV reserved that had to be picked up by 4:00. With the flight arriving later than that we were unable to pick it up. Unfortunately not only did we still have to pay for that day, but I had to scramble to find a place to stay for the night in Vegas AND pay for that too. We had planned our trip According to the weather forecast as well and due to this delay we ended up in snowstorms and really unable to enjoy the things we went to see. Had we had that extra day we would have been a day ahead of the weather. I am extremely disappointed in the communication received by your airline and completely disappointed that we had to spend in excess of an extra 300.00 that I was not expecting to spend. I understand short delays but we literally lost an entire day, an excessive amount of money and lots of good weather. I do want to acknowledge however that the 2 male flight attendants were simply amazing and recognize them for their good work. I sent this to Allegiant and was told that there would be zero compensation. I was quoted an FAA quote that says that they don't have to do anything. My response, just because you don't have to doesn't mean you shouldn't. I will never fly Allegiant again. No explanation No apologies No nothing. The flight attendants on the way home were horrible too. The only good thing about this flight was the flight attendants on the way there

### "not a brand I’m willing to support"
Not Verified |  I’ve flown through both of these airports several times with no issues. Their prices aren’t much different from Southwest but the Mesa airport is closer to my destination. On this flight they randomly decided the carry-on bag that I’ve used every time was too big and had to be charged for. I watched this lady allow several people with the same size bags go on without any issue. Why she targeted me? I don’t know, maybe Allegiant has employees that are comfortable discriminating. I think this is a major ethical red flag and not a brand I’m willing to support.

### "They refused to compensate me"
Not Verified |  My flight was canceled 3 hours before takeoff. The next available flight out of the airport was 2 weeks away. The cost me $250 to extend my car rental and drive to another state to catch a flight home. They refused to compensate me, even with a voucher, for these additional costs and inconveniences. I will never fly them again and strongly suggest against doing so yourself.

### "no attempt to enforce the mask mandate"
Allegiant very clearly stated at the time I made our reservations and annouced at the gate several times that face mask were required and to be worn correctly. Yet, passengers were allowed move around freely in the cabin without a mask. One of the flight attendants wore a mask but did not cover her nose. There was no attempt made by the employees of Allegiant to enforce the mask mandate.

### "I wouldn’t recommend Allegiant Air"
Never got to go on this flight as it delayed so many times over the course of two full days. Was scheduled to take off at 9:19 am on October 1 and didn’t depart until almost 6pm on October 2. When we received a delay announcement on day two after the long day sitting at the airport and waiting, paying for hotels and loosing our rental car, condo reservations and boat passes at our Destination, we opted to contact Allegiant via phone and with no explanation other than maintenance, they refunded our money. The disregard of the staff for what they had put us through was the reason for this review. There was no compensation for our troubles other than the refund which we were grateful for. But we all spent 2 days in Columbus for no reason whatsoever! I wouldn’t recommend Allegiant Air to anyone that needs to actually get somewhere.

### "no social distancing on these planes"
Not Verified |  Phoenix AZ to Rockford with Allegiant Air. There is no social distancing on these planes, every seat is filled. Not very safe in these times right now, I was very dissatisfied to see this. I won’t use again during the pandemic.

### "disregard for the health of the passengers"
Not Verified |  I am sitting on a flight, ready to take off. Around me are passengers who are not wearing their masks correctly ... under their nose, on their chin. The steward when told, clearly, could not care less. As we boarded, one stewardess stood in the front, greeting the oncoming passengers slowly sipping a drink. I guess as they say, you get what you pay for - but the blatant disregard for the health of the passengers, who do care, it is appalling.

### "everyone was crammed in two seats"
Got on the plane, everyone was crammed in two seats. They had tons of open seats, asked if I could move she was not happy with me. What happened to 6 feet apart and Covid?

### "not a proponent of masks"
Allegiant air refused me boarding. I was waiting in the boarding area when an agent told me I must cover my nose. At this point I was over 10 feet away and no one within 10 feet or more. In 5 or so minutes he came back by and told me to cover my nose. At this point I moved out of sight and sat down with my back to them. Around me were 9 to 10 people who were not covering noses, just in the area I was in. When time for boarding came the agent would not let me board. I did have the mask on and nose covered because I was in social distance of people. I asked for a supervisor and she would not let me on based on the agents testimony. This supervisor was intent on not letting me board. I asked to talk to her supervisor. After a brief conversation with her supervisor she said I could board. I had to promise to keep the mask on. I was the last person on the plane. When on the plane I was upgraded to the front of the plane so they could watch me. My cabin mates across from me were not obeying and had there masks below their noses. Numerous times the stewards would pass and not say anything to them about there masks. I hope that Allegiant air will give some sensitivity training to their employees in this pandemic time. I am definitely not a proponent of masks for all situations. There are times like on a plane where I believe they might do something, but come on man, when your 10 feet or so away let's get real. Science hasn't convinced me totally on how a masked society at large could save the world. I was constantly monitored on the plane about my mask when right next to me were 2 people that obviously were allowed to wear there masks below their nose without any mention.

### "never book this airline again"
I got to the front desk to check in my bags to receive my military discount am hour and a half before my flight. No one ever came to the counter. Me and 8 other people missed the flight because of needed to check a bag. Sat on the customer service line for over a hour trying to get assistance. One a representative came to the line he then proceeded to tell me per his records he show I am the only person that missed the flight. I then asked him to repeat his self for the other people standing here who also missed boarding the same flight. Then and only then did a manager come to the phone and tell me the best she can do is book me for the next flight which is 3 days away at the price $75. So not only did they cause me to miss my flight but also charged me for another one. The staff was so unprofessional and didn’t care. Everyone had to purchase new flights. I will never book this airline again.

### "not my fault for the delay"
Ok, so I understand things happen. Flights get delayed, canceled, whatever. If thats the case, however, then accomodations must be made. I did my part by arriving early and prepared to board. Im paying to get from point a to point b at certain times. Its not my fault for the delay. So now Im here, stuck at an airport where i was just told we will have to leave because its closing. I'm losing a day or more (since they have no idea when the next flight will be)of work, i have a brother who will miss this flight and another since he is going to another destination. My 2 year old diaebetic daughter has no place to stay and i have no means of getting them to another location. The best the staff could offer? That I, me, not them, call customer relations. Do the right thing. If you cant hold to your end of the bargain, then you must make things right. What a joke.

### "Do not  use Allegiant’s bundle options"
Do not ever use Allegiant’s bundle options! This is the 2nd time I have tried to use them with a rental car option. Last time they claimed I did not have a car rental reserved despite my conf number. This time they bumped our flight from arriving at 8 pm to 10:30 pm We arrived with all car rental booths closed! Entire family waited until midnight for a taxi that cost $127 to get to our condo. I called Allegiant and was told I could go back to the airport at 8 am the next day- another $127 to get my rental. No reimbursement for the taxi, no apologies. Simply told me I should have checked Alamo hours! Really?

### "always pleasant in flight also"
Customer service was great on the phone accommodating us after they changed our flight times! They are always pleasant in flight also. Glad to see direct flights from Fort Wayne! We rented a car with our airfare this time when they sent out a coupon for us to use. I do not recommend that at all! Ended up paying another $335 in fees at the rental center. Had I known I would have just rented on my own like we usually do and saved a few hundred dollars.

### "lost our luggage on a direct flight"
Not Verified | We flew from South Bend to Las Vegas 7/2/20 where baggage lost our luggage on a direct flight and was never found. We we’re told we could file a claim and be reimbursed for items lost and items we had to purchase while there. We filed a claim with receipts as proof two things in our suitcase and purchased things needed while there for almost $1900 we get an email today from the baggage claim saying they’re offering us $287 this is despicable. I will never step foot on a allegiant flight again. Why submit all these things with proof of cost if they aren’t going to even come close to giving you the money you spent and lost from them losing your baggage.

### "flight time was changed 3 times"
I have traveled with Allegiant a lot. Until today I have not had a problem. After booking my flight my flight time was changed 3 times. The last change would have gotten me into Sanford at 10:00 pm then I have a 2.5 hour ride home and have to be to work at 5am. The big problem is that it is very obvious that the crew with this airline couldn’t possibly care less. They will do whatever they want and don’t care how it effects their passengers.

### "not be flying with this airline again"
The day before departure, we were offered the opportunity to upgrade for a small fee. Considering that I’m an exceptionally tall person, my girlfriend immediately took advantage of the opportunity and got us seats in the front row. Our seats were confirmed at the gate but upon boarding the plane, we were informed that their policy is to keep the front rows empty. As I write this, my knees are in the seat back in front of me and will not be flying with this airline again.

### "the worst airline ever"
Not Verified | By far the worst airline ever. My flight got delayed twice. There departure times are never accurate. The staff working on the plane were not paying attention on their jobs and instead on there phones. I’ve been waiting at my gate since 2:30 in the afternoon expecting to leave at 4:30 but had to wait another hour or so to leave at 6:10-15.

### "won't be flying with them again"
They did not do much to prevent Covid or practice social distancing. They didn't sanitize after the fight before us got off, we lined up and got right on after. They handed out masks but it was optional to wear them. They also condensed fights and every seat was full. Had i known all this i wouldn't have flown with them. Very disappointing! We won't be flying with them again.

### "packed in like sardines"
Reno to Las Vegas. As COVID cases are raising, this airline is doing absolutely nothing  to help prevent the spread. They have the airplane packed in like sardines. They’ve also double booked seats. I would not have flown if I would’ve know they were being this careless.

### "plane was full with no social distancing"
Allentown to Punta Gorda. I returned my rental car to enterprise and they didn’t have the phone number for Allegiant even though they are in the same building. An enterprise agent did wheelchair me to the check in counter. Then they sat me in the wheelchair waiting for someone to come. After 15 minutes I used the ladies room. Again waited...I felt that I needed to struggle walking to the gate as no one showed up and I didn’t want to miss my flight. Two couples without masks were allowed on the plane and the plane was full with no social distancing. From Florida to Allentown everyone had an empty seat next to them. Not on the way! Have they forgotten how deadly the virus is? So within a month we went from being responsible and trying to keep distance between people and now it’s as though the covid-19 is a non issue.

### "people not wearing a mask"
I am an emergency room physician. My wife and i are both over 60. Shame on Allegiant for risking my life and those of the other 100 or so people on that plane by not following basic protocols for social distancing. We arrive at the airport and loading instead of being done in a organized fashion maintaining the 6 feet spacing is business as usual as people are standing on top of each other in the aisles. After landing in Niagara Falls it was really bad as no attempt to keep people seated to offload appropriately was even tried. In addition people are on the place not wearing a mask. Middle seats were not left open. It was business as usual.

### "concerned about the crowded conditions"
Not Verified |  We provided this complaint into the Airline’s email complaint system, then posted letters to the CEO of Allegiant and the Washington State Department of Health. We then submitted an official complaint to the FAA. Three days later, we have yet to receive a response. So much for government accountability! Allegiant Flight 582 on May 24, 2020 from Mesa, AZ to Pasco, WA Regarding the subject flight, we were very concerned about the crowded conditions on the subject plane. Most rows had every seat taken. In our row the middle seat was taken by an individual who was not a family member and not wearing a mask. My wife, Marjorie and I are also a member of a vulnerable group, age 70 and above. There was never any opportunity given to us to request to be seated in a row that complied with social distance guidelines. We wore masks and gloves for the entire flight, but wonder if these measures were sufficient given the crowded conditions in your plane. I might remind you that New York subways had high death rates when train were crowded with passengers. There were a number of children who were crying almost the entire flight. The flight attendant did give a bottle of water to one of the infants, and that seem to calm that child down. What other measures might have been taken like giving some candy? Upon boarding your plane, we were given a package containing a mask, gloves and Sani wipes but there was no requirement to use them. We noted that the next flight announced boarding before we even reached the luggage area. I conclude that the plane could not have been completely cleaned by the airline personnel! Thinking back on our flight, boarding was started 10 or 15-minutes after the last passenger debarked! I conclude that both flights (and most likely all flights made by that plane on that day) could not have been properly cleaned. Was it your plan to leave up to passengers to clean their own areas? If so, this deficiency should have been announced to all passengers. We were not traveling for pleasure, instead travel for us was essential as we were attending the funeral of my father who died at an age of 95.

### "attendants did not wear masks"
Not Verified |  Extremely disappointed with Allegiant Air. Before booking air travel for an elderly family member we were assured of the safety measures that they were taking to prevent the spread of Covid 19. We were told that seats were being assigned to insure social distancing of passengers (ie. Not assigning the middle seat) and that all passengers would receive a safety pouch with mask, gloves and sanitizing wipes. Our family member was seated in a FULL row with a very full plane. No safety pouches were ever distributed (masks only were offered -not required). Once in the air they proceeded to have drink service and attendants did not wear masks! The passenger right next to our family member ordered 2 drinks. Of course consuming them without a mask. Does this sound like a safe flight to you? Very upset and concerned for our family member. Please be aware air travel not as safe as the airline might make it sound.

### "I should not have lost $174"
Not Verified |  During virus scare my flight was cancelled. When I received a voucher for the flight it was for $174 less than I paid. I used a voucher when I booked the original flight and they did not give me credit for it. Because they cancelled the flight I should not have lost $174.

### "Not too bad and thanks"
I canceled flights because of corona virus and tried to get a credit voucher over the phone today. After calling, I was immediately connected to Ashley who emailed me my vouchers which I received within 5 minutes. Not too bad and thanks!

### "a horrible business to support"
Given our current covid-19 pandemic I called the airline in order to get a refund instead of a credit due to the fact that my family is high risk and we will not be taking a flight anymore. Once this pandemic cleared up we would plan to drive instead and have no need for the airline ticket. When I called the lady I spoke to was not only incredibly rude even though I was very polite and professional, she also threatened me after issuing the refund by saying that they have documented in my account that they will never waive any type of fees for us. Talk about incredibly rude and a horrible business to support. They need to be more understanding and respectful of the fact that we are in a pandemic. I will never support this business again!

### "helped make the changes quickly"
Not Verified |  Peoria to Punta Gorda. Just wanted to say kudos to the young lady who helped with my flight change. Due to the virus outbreak wife and I had to push our Florida trip out a few months. The young lady was a delightful person who helped make the changes quickly. She was also considerate enough to inquire how we were doing during our stay at home situation. I didn't get her name but you need more like her.

### "staff was amazing"
Punta Gorda to Cincinnati. I was in Naples, Florida house/dog sitting for friends. Long story, short, their trip was cancelled, so needed to get back home. Could not get through on phone line, the website was overwhelmed. Went directly to the airport to try and exchange the return trip ticket for that day. It was all hands on deck, some people had worked 12-hour shifts, still, the staff was amazing, tried to make whatever it took to accommodate passengers request. They all looked a bit frazzled. In a situation like this, that no one has experienced, you just can’t fix stupid and some people are just jerks.

### "phone lines are busy all day"
Cincinnati to Ft Walton. I have been trying to call Allegiant to cancel my flight due to the Coronavirus and phone lines are busy all day, I have been trying for 5 hours now! The web site states you can cancel on line with no Penalty, and either a refund or Voucher will be issued. It showed me how much I was getting refunded and it’s less than what I paid for the tickets for me and my son and this is only on my Departing flight, it will not let me cancel my returning flights! It gives you a non working number to call! So if I can not get through to anyone, the main number is busy or off the hook and the number they give you is a non working number how are our flights going to get canceled and how our we getting refunded the amount we paid for our tickets.

### "I can’t get through on the phone"
Memphis to Fort Lauderdale. I have been calling customer service since Friday and the line has been busy. I had to cancel my flight due to the Coronavirus situation that’s going on and I don’t think that it’s fair to only be given a voucher for $167 when I paid $381. This was going to be my 1st time and last time flying. If I can’t be refunded all of my money I wanted to see if our tickets could be reinstated but no one is responding to my emails and I can’t get through on the phone lines. I need help with this issue asap.

### "make sure all our questions were answered"
Not Verified |  My review is based on a flight (Detroit to St Pete Clearwater) this coming week which, we canceled due to the coronavirus. I had heard the wait was long so I prepared for such a wait at this trying time for all. My wait was a little over 2 hrs. I was happy to get a wonderful gal in the other end who was thoughtful and took time to make sure all of our questions were answered regarding getting our refund and how to use in the future. She waited until the emails came in and made sure we got or vouchers. It made the expected wait time all worth it.

### "least military friendly airline"
Los Angeles to Springfield. Allegiant has to be the least military friendly airline operating in the US. First they change their baggage policy to require active duty to be flying with dependents, without notifying customers, which makes no sense. Especially in light of the fact that our spouses can't fly right now due to DOD orders. Then, when active military can't fly due to DOD order, they want to charge a cancellation fee online (even though they say they don't) OR you can call a number that is always busy. We have several reservations to fly with them, and considering we either have to fly now/later or get a voucher, we have no option for full refunds and are forced to complete travel or lose money. Ticket prices with Allegiant ARE NOT cost effective when you have to check multiple bags, as many military families do due to living so far away from home. We will never book another flight with Allegiant again.

### "make changes without penalty"
Not Verified |  Trying to change my son's flight due to the Corona virus!! What a nightmare. Started the process 2 days ago. They said you could make changes without penalty. I tried doing that through the website but it would not let me. The number busy for days. I drove to the airport an hour away to be turned away. Currently been on hold for 2 hours starting at 12.45 am. Ridiculous. Never again will I use this airline!

### "never fly with Allegiant again"
Not Verified |  Phoenix to South bend. Allegiant Air has the worst customer service of any airline I have ever experienced. Despite efforts of emailing, calling and Facebook messages multiple times over the last week, we could not reach one airline employee. Finally, we decided to go to the airport in hopes of a flight change. Despite an email from Allegiant on the 8th stating that flights could be changed due to the pandemic, they would not stand behind their offer to change our flight. Around $400 was lost on the flight. I will never fly with Allegiant again nor suggest them to anyone.

### "Her luggage was lost"
Nashville to Gulfport. My sister and I fly together. We checked our luggage at the same time at the Allegiant air ticket counter. When we arrived in Gulfport, only my luggage appeared on the conveyor. Her luggage was lost. It took about 27 phone calls and several emails before being able to reach customer service. I spoke with Two customer service representatives. The first one was Carol. She was rude, degrading and hateful. And then I was conveniently disconnected. When I finally reached a second representative, Orlando, he was also unconcerned. Final results of spending my very first day, without luggage, on my vacation, was that my luggage would be shipped to the resort but Boone was able to tell me when it would arrive. I was also told that I needed to keep receipts of anything that I purchased, within reason. And I asked if I would be reimbursed, her response was, “why else would I ask you to keep your receipts”. The second person, Orlando told me not to purchase any namebrand items or they would not reimburse me for those things. There was no compassion that my vacation was ruined. There was only 39 people on the airplane. Two people did not receive their luggage.

### "more reliable airlines out there"
Bismarck to Las Vegas return. The flight itself was good. But we had about a 1.5 hour delay before we left and over a 2 hour delay leaving which messed up a lot of our plans. Customer service after our 2 hour delay was horrible! Think twice about using Allegiant! Their are plenty other more reliable airlines out there!

### "There was no refund"
Punta Gorda to Indianapolis. I have always flown Allegiant and I fly quite often. With this Coronavirus scare, and reading that there will be no penalty for canceling a flight, I tried emailing, calling and Facebook messenger to connect with someone. No response and via phone for the past few days all it says is all lines are busy. Are they deliberately doing this so no cancellation can be made during this time? I finally cancelled my return trip via the app. There was no refund. Now I’m stuck. I will never fly Allegiant again! I will pay more for a flight and fly an airline with better customer service!

### "such an unethical company"
Allegiant is such an unethical company. We had a flight from LA to Boise. They cancelled our flight and told us they would refund our money or let us take another flight 4 days later. The amount they offered did not come close to covering the costs of the cancellation between food, hotel, transportation, etc. Even more atrocious is their customer service. I tried calling customer service to find out what to do and literally waited for OVER 3 hours without anyone every picking up. I then drove to the airport at 7:00 in the evening and there was not a single Allegiant representative at Los Angeles Airport. I tried to chat online but they were kept giving me an all agents are busy. I wasn't able to get ahold of anyone until after I got home and they were very rude and unapologetic. Their excuse is they are busy.

### "not accommodating at all"
Not Verified |  Cedar Rapids to St Petersburg . Asked to get a credit on flight dates and times due to the outbreak of the corona virus. Allegiant was not accommodating at all. Charged you 99.00 per person and the difference between the price of tickets now and future prices. We purchased tickets for 200.00 for existing trip and would have had to pay 400.00 per ticket to change our dates. Every other airline has been making accommodations for flights and offering vouchers. Not Allegiant! I hold their MasterCard and use their airlines often. We will be finding other airports to fly out of and will discontinue with their MasterCard. It’s very unfortunate when not everyone is on board with unforeseen events.

### "single worst flight experience"
Not Verified | Allentown to Sanford. Not one part of this experience was enjoyable. They boarded us an hour and a half before our flight took off, as soon as everyone was ready to depart they said we would be on the runway for an hour and 10 minutes. As soon as we landed there were more problems and we remained on the runway for over 40 minutes as no stairs were attached for us to depart. The single worst flight experience my family has ever had.

### "learn to train their staff"
Not Verified |  Ft Lauderdale to Asheville . The lack of a "Take Charge" person at the ticket counter in Fort Lauderdale was extremely disconcerting. Over 200 people were in line and there was NOT one person that had the backbone nor (obviously) the authority to actually make an announcement about a cancelled flight. The fact that most of the travelers had more common sense and understood the situation better than the Allegiant staff is very telling about the direction this company is heading. The staff did not know the reason for the flight to Knoxville being cancelled to the following day. They had no manager on staff. The staff was kind, however, when you have 200 people that are being told they have to find a place to stay for the night, the kindness wore off very quickly. Each passenger was given an $8 food voucher .. what a joke! All the restaurants are on the other side of security. You cannot get through security without a valid boarding pass! No one was offered accommodations for the night. It became intense rather quickly. The staff were not trained and were ill prepared to deal with the scenario unfolding in front of them. There was noi management to handle the situation. I am seriously questioning whether I want to fly with this airline again. Corporate needs to learn to train their staff to communicate in an effective manner to disgruntled customers.

### "delay the flight one hour at a time"
Not Verified |  Louisville to Ft. Lauderdale. I fly this airline multiple times a year, and you get what you pay for. They will delay the flight one hour at a time until you have been wait for 5 hours. This has happened more times than I can count in the last few years. And good luck trying to get a hold of someone on the customer service line. I honestly wonder if anybody even works there or it's just a answering machine. I will never understand why they wont just tell people the flight is delayed until the last minute. I don't mind to wait I just don't want to sit at the airport for hours. And many people I have spoken with feel the same way.

### "Worst airline experience"
St Pete/Tampa to Indianapolis. Worst airline experience ever. We were delayed 6 hours first due to a runway problem but then followed by a series of very poor decisions by Allegiant. Avoid this company at all cost. The small price savings is not worth the high level of stress and delays that are regularly happening with this company.

### "terrible customer service"
Concord to Sanford. Our flight was originally delayed by 15 minutes. As the delay stretched longer and longer, no one could officially tell us what was going on or how long we would wait, only that they would not give any refunds but that we could transfer flights to another day without penalty. However in order to even do that, we would have to leave to go to the ticketing office, which was outside the TSA security checkpoint. TSA had left by then (with stancheons up that prevented anyone from leaving), so our fear was that of we left, and didn't get rebooked, we couldn't come back and wait for our current flight since there was no security left. We waited for over 2 hours with no information. Eventually we were told that we would be leaving FOUR hours late. We eventually did, but after asking what would happen since we would arrive in Sanford five hours before the rental car agency counter opened (or three hours after it closed), we were told that we would just have to wait or ask them when we got there. When we got there there were no employees of Allegiant there to ask so we asked the Allegiant luggage check in supervisor, who was working with departing flights and she said she was just contracted through Allegiant (though she had an Allegiant shirt on and was working at an Allegiant counter) and that I had to contact Allegiant customer care...which was closed then since it was 4 am. She also said we would have to wait for five more hours for our rental car and there was nothing she could do even though we booked the car through Allegiant. At least the rental car agency was open and had good customer service (unlike Allegiant) and we didn't have to camp out for five additional hours. We heard no updates until we has already been sitting there for hours. And even when we had an update, we were never, to this day, provided with an explanation. Terrible, terrible customer service. We were there with a friend who was waiting for over 6 hours for her flight to St. Petersburg FL. This is not a stand-alone incident.

### "Everything costs you extra money"
Punta Gorda to Niagara Falls with Allegiant Air. Everything costs you extra money. Boarding passes on your phone not on the app cost another fee. Might as well book with a decent airline and get a free cup of water.

### "don’t recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Stockton to Las Vegas. This was my first time using this airline. It had pretty good reviews but had been notified of delays before. I went ahead and booked with them. This is the first time and definitely the last time!!! A delay on a bright morning? In the afternoon? I should have just went to Sacramento international airport. I don’t recommend this airline at least in small cities!

### "They know absolutely nothing"
This was to be my first flight on this airline. I fly often and was reluctant but thought I would give it a try. I booked a Thurs 2/20 trip from Concord to St Pete, FL. It was snowing that night so they had a delay to de ice the plane. The guy in the de icer truck ran into the plane. We had to return to the terminal. They have no mechanics at the airport so it took 1.5 hrs for one to arrive to inspect the damage. What were our options we wanted to know. How long would it take to inspect? Would they have another plane come and get us? Was there another flight the next day? They said "we have nothing to tell you, we are waiting on corporate but if you leave the terminal you forfeit your ticket". After 2 hrs they said there was another flight next day but there was only 28 spots available. The ticket counter was outside of security. There was a huge line. Did they provide food and drinks? No. However they lied to the local TV channel and said they did provide as well as give meal vouchers. At 9pm they announced last call at the concession. At 10pm they closed the TSA security checkpoint so if you went out to change your flight and waited in line for 2hrs you couldnt get back into the terminal. I gave up and left the terminal and went home at 10:30 expecting to eat the cost. I did have my wife call customer service to try and get me rebooked for the following night. She got through after a 1:20 minute hold time. They did refund the ticket. I was told the flight arrived in St Pete at 2 AM All the staff at the customer service, gate people, and guys working on the runway are all kids, 18-22 area. They know absolutely nothing and really dont care. Remember, if you fly this airline there are only 2 flight a week per route so if it gets cancelled you are stuck

### "service is mediocre at best"
Northwest Arkansas to Sanford . I have flown Allegiant on several different occasions and more times than not the fights are delayed. The current flight I’m waiting on now has changed from 8:30 PM now to depart at 11 PM. One would think I would learn by now that there is a reason this airline has flights for so cheap. The service is mediocre at best, the flights are ok when you finally get to get on them, and the baggage charges are high. I think it’s about time I upgrade to a better airline.

### "superb crew and good communication"
Not Verified |  Concord to Orlando Sanford. Excellent flight with superb crew and good communication from the cockpit as well. Makes a passenger feel better when the Captain or First Officer chimes in during the trip.

### "more and more disappointed"
Fort Lauderdale to Norfolk. I am growing more and more disappointed and frustrated with this airline after each flight. The lack of timeliness has gone from bad to worse! To think it’s not that cheaply priced when you add all the extras up. I used to recommend this airline with hopes it would be a good experience and not represent the horrible experiences it has created for myself and my family thus far. Customer service is at the bottom of their priorities which is even sadder because that should be done well and free in a client service industry.

### "poor excuse for an airline"
St Pete Clearwater to Indianapolis, they really need better management or coordinator. My flight today was set for 9:27 departure. Delayed. They said it was weather, but I fly small planes and it could have landed just like the plane that came in a few minutes later. Rerouted to Orlando. It's now 11:30, the plane was only supposed to be gone an hour but 3 hours later. They tell everyone it's still in Orlando. Can you not do better than this. I could have gone to Tampa with delta and could have been there by now. Poor excuse for an airline.

### "everything like pulling teeth"
Not Verified | Fort Lauderdale to Concord. This airline is easily the worst of the worst. To get a hold of an actual human being is next to impossible. They make reservations easy (the part they make money) and then everything else is like pulling teeth. This airline, for full clarity, did one good round trip and then this one happened. I thought I found a winner until I had an issue. Then I get no information outside of “your flight has been delayed”. You can’t even speak to a real person because they are so cheap that the ticket agents double as boarding agents. This airline has two planes that leave this airport a day. How on earth they have a mechanical or otherwise delay is beyond me. I can guarantee that the only thing keeps these planes in the air is the FAA because the amount of dollar stretching is ridiculous. I’ve personally seen this airline make people miss cruises, hold people hostage in an airport (because the tiny airport TSA checkpoint closed so you couldn’t leave and come back), and make you wait over an hour on hold to talk to an actual person. I tried to allow them to reimburse me for my day lost on my trip but the fact that each and every time they screw something up to me is unacceptable. I hope this company gets the exposure they deserve - that they are run by people who care more about profits than passengers. The flight crew has been nice so it’s clearly not the ground staff. This is a corporate issue. If the people that owned this airline had to fly this way I guarantee someone would be fired. Spend the extra hundred or two dollars and fly an airline that knows how to communicate and fly on time.

### "ruined due to cancelled flight"
Not Verified |  Our trip to FL and Universal Resort Orlando was ruined due to cancelled flight and the inability of Allegiant to get our Universal resort hotel rebooked to match offered flights! There was nothing comparable available! Do not book your hotel thru Allegiant, there is no recourse from the hotel to help with rebooking! Also be aware that Allegiant only offers a flight on selected days, so if there is a problem, you are out of luck. Thank God we didn’t have children who would have been so upset. Don’t plan an important vacation with Allegiant unless you have a lot of flexibility.

### "Outrageous behavior"
Greenville to Ft Lauderdale. Outrageous behavior by Allegiant staff. Flight G41759 February 7. Approached counter and requested boarding pass because one could not be obtained from kiwi.com. The counter woman told me that I would have to pay for my boarding pass. I ask her why I would pay for a boarding pass. She printed the ticket and in a condescending voice stated "Well since you're a beginner traveler (truth: I'll be 62 in a few days and am a retired attorney and research librarian and have traveled by air for 50 years without incident) you won't have to pay the $5.00" I failed to reply, took the ticket and walked on.

### "Everything was better than expected"
I very rarely leave reviews but after seeing all the awful ones for Allegiant I felt I should post about my good experience. I absolutely hate flying and am very picky about the airline, but my husband and I took a short flight from Provo, UT to Mesa, AZ on Allegiant and the experience was great. Planes were on time, no issues whatsoever, flight attendants were very kind, and they have such nice perks for military and dependents. Everything was better than expected. Thank you!

### "This was my worst travel"
Not Verified |  Stockton to Las Vegas with Allegiant Air. Was charged $50 each way for a small carry on. One attendant would say it’s ok, another says no I have to pay $50. and they were rude - horrible service. They should just say no carry on whatsoever. Do the math and tack $100 to your flight ticket and see if it’s better to use Southwest or another airline. We were crammed in small seats with tickets costing more than SW. This was my worst travel.

### "additional $50 charge for the carry on"
Ft Lauderdale to Syracuse. All of Allegiant policies for carry on are clear cut. They allow a carry on bag, coat, dog etc. Upon checking in just now I was ordered to pay an additional $50 charge for the carry on. Absolutely unacceptable! Not to mention the space was overbooked, and smelled horrible.

### "Would not recommend"
Not Verified |  . Bangor to OrlandoBooked hotel and flight together for family of 5. Our flight was delayed several hours with no explanation. The worst was the hotel they offered, it was a less then 2 star, unsafe and unsanitary. They booked us for 2 rooms for 3 kids and 2 adults, but not adjoining rooms. There were cockroaches and ants in the rooms but no soap or toilet paper. We left this hotel after we tried 2 different rooms (3 bolt locks on doors with a sign to use them, main security door was busted). Allegiant refused to refund the remaining nights for the 2 rooms. Would not recommend.

### "a 9-hour delay"
Not Verified | The flight was to depart at 10:55 am. Arrived 2 hours ahead of flight only to be notified a half-hour before departure that there was a 9-hour delay then delayed again for another 45 min. I fly this airline twice a month and this is the second time this has happened so it will be the last time I fly Allegiant!

### "will never fly Allegiant again"
Not Verified | Ogdensburg to Sanford. Allegiant left my family and I stranded in Sanford for the return flight home. Allegiant's solution was to fly us home 7 days later, which was unreasonable. They played the "because of the weather" card so that they don't have to be responsible for us and offered the reimbursement very quickly. There was no issue with the weather at all which was confirmed by our weather regulator. I will never fly Allegiant again

### "has been the worst experience"
Punta Gorda  to  Portsmouth. This has been the worst experience of my life with so many delays. I’m trying to get some where I don’t want to sit and have to wait. Delayed on the way down and delayed on the way back. Seats are uncomfortable, no elbow room, you have to pay for legit every bag.

### "Thanks a lot for nothing"
Las Vegas to Stickton. We came to the airport thinking our flight was to be at 3:17 and after we checked in and looked at our Boarding Passes, we noticed they had switched the flight and wasn’t leaving until 6:17. Having the flu, staying an additional 4 hrs was not desirable for obvious reasons. When we inquired they said it was a “corporate decision” due to there only being 10 passengers on the 3:17 flight. Thanks a lot for nothing Allegiant. Also they charge for everything .

### "provided service above and beyond"
Not Verified |  We were running late for a flight from Kansas City and Allegiant provided service above and beyond. Thru TSA I was able to obtain the phone number of the manager. She was at home, not even at work, yet returned my phone call and thru text messaging, helped us get on our flight. I was amazed at the personal service and meeting people in corporate jobs who actually care about their job and actually also cared about me, the consumer. Go Allegiant Air!

### "not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Punta Gorda to Rochester. Terrible experience. 3hr delay on trip to FL, and another delay of 3+hrs on the way back. Nothing was offered to make up for the huge waste of time. Flight itself was comfortable, did not experience much turbulance, landing and takeoff were smooth. Would not recommend this airline if you value your time.

### "unpleasant and embarrassing"
Concord to Punta Gorda. The flight attendant was extremely rude, creating an unpleasant and embarrassing experience for me during the flight. I have flown with Allegiant plenty of times and have never been super impressed by the staff affiliated with this airline, but this woman was completely disrespectful to me when I went to order my adult beverage and showed her my passport. I am not one to leave negative reviews but that was completely uncalled for when I am paying for my experience and supporting the business. It doesn’t help that I had a long layover with multiple gate changes and delays on the way home from St. Petersburg. I am considering whether to book with this airline any more after this.

### "The worst airline ever"
Chicago Rockford to Punta Gorda. The worst airline ever. No real customer service, expensive add ons, flight changes constantly, uncomfortable airplanes. This airline should not be in business.

### "No customer service"
Not Verified |  Took Allegiant Air from Asheville to Ft Lauderdale. The flight was an hour and 40 minutes. It took Allegiant an hour and 20 minutes to get the luggage to the carousel in baggage claim. No customer service, no one at the ticket counter, no one to answer why I was held hostage.

### "My flight was cancelled"
My flight was cancelled at 8am, flight was to take off at 10:18 and they supposed help. Well not so much my 2.5 hr flight turned into over 7 hours. The 3rd party company used to compensate did not cover change in flight. I had to go to a airport 30 miles further then go back to Sanford Fl airport to get my car. I ended up over $100 in the hole and ruined the ends of my holiday vacation. Customer service basically said So! Please don't fly this airline I know I won't.

### "I was on hold for 2 hours"
I’m a big Allegiant fan but yesterday I tried to add a minor passenger to our trip home and I was on hold for 2 hours! Then the representative took all my info and credit card and booked the minor the opposite direction of the trip I asked for! I then had to wait another 25 minutes on hold for a supervisor to fix the mistake. By the time I hung up I had been on hold or working to add my passenger for 2 hours and 45 minutes! Come on Allegiant, I love you but really?

### "cabin crew were extremely nice and helpful"
Not Verified |  Asheville to Fort Lauderdale. My flight with Allegiant Air was much better than I expected. The cabin crew were extremely nice and helpful. Takeoff was smooth and landing was butter, which is unusual for a discount airline. *Cough* Ryanair *Cough*. The seats were usual discount airline seats and food was slightly overpriced. Overall, the value for your money is good for the fact that this is a discount airline.

### "Highly disappointed"
Omaha to Las Vegas booked for February 2020. Highly disappointed. We mistakenly booked our upcoming flight to Las Vegas a day later than the party we are meeting in Vegas in February 2020. To add to this disappointment we will be missing a once in a lifetime experience with our friends. I made attempts to call on 3 occasions with exceptionally long wait times. After 3 frustrating attempts I took to the live chat and independent options only to learn it would cost $324 dollars to change our flights. Frustrated with this information I wanted to hear the facts from a live person. I waited out a 53 minute wait time. The representative was courteous but unable to make the changes at any less expense. This entire process was very disheartening considering there are open seats on the flight we need and it is more than 2 months in advance!

### "we got what we paid for"
Not Verified |  Ogdensburg to Sanford. This is known as a discount flier, so we got what we paid for. People were good and plane was excellent. People just need to remember that it is not built around full service. Reason I am saying this is that some passengers complained about luggage rates, but it is clear from the start on the site that all those fees are extra and prices are right there for you to see. Liked flying out of Ogdensburg, but out of Sanford not so much as hotel options are not that great

### "I would never fly Allegiant again"
Cincinnati to Newark. I was traveling for Christmas on 23rd Monday to visit my family. My flight was at 7 am. I checked in my luggage at the ticketing center (long lines for luggage Checkin), and there was extremely long line at security check point as well, so ended up reaching the counter at 6:47 am. No one was at the desk. I  hopped on to next counter. The lady there said the door closed 5 mins ahead. I was already at the airport with the luggage checked in, but still they didn’t wait for literally two mins. The lady at the counter was just saying the next flight is on Friday 27th or book another flight with Southwest. I understand I didn’t consider extreme long lines at both ticketing center and as well as security clearance, but I would have very much appreciated if they could consider literally 2 mins. I would never fly Allegiant again.

### "made no attempt to provide anything"
Our Allegiant flight from Ft Lauderdale to Asheville was horrendous. We had a 7.30 pm flight on Dec 21st 2019 that was first delayed until 9.00. When 9.00 came, the flight was delayed until 11.05. When 11.05 came it was delayed until 12.00 am. When 12 came, again it was delayed until 1.09. We were told that the plane had finally arrived and we could line up to board. As soon as the flight emptied, it was announced that the flight crew had timed out and the flight wouldn't leave until 5.30 the next morning. They offered a $100 voucher. No updates or explanations were given and through most of this there were no attendants to be found. The airport terminal was freezing and all of the vendor areas were closed. Allegiant made no attempt to provide anything to make folks more comfortable. At this point it is 3.00 am and everyone is shivering. Not sure if the flight will go at 5.30 am as promised

### "no hotel vouchers would be given"
Not Verified |  On Sunday Decmber 15, 2019 was scheduled for departure 9:28 PM from gate 5 at the Chattanooga airport flying to Orlando. We started boarding later than the scheduled time, and after sitting on the plane for a little while, an announcement was made that there was an issue with a filter that the crew was working on resolving. Shortly after, we were asked to deplane, as they were having trouble removing the old filter. Once we had deplaned, an announcement was made that they were working on the issue. They informed us that they were working to get another plane in from Orlando that night. However, if they weren’t able to by midnight, we would have to wait until morning to fly home. They announced that all of us had the option to move to a different flight on a different day, going to a different airport. Another announcement was made by Allegiant staff that they were still working to get a replacement plane and crew in tonight. They informed us that if not, our flight would be move to around 0800 am in the morning, and that we would be provided with hotel vouchers. Shortly after this, a cart with a large number of pizzas was brought in and everyone was offered a slice of pizza. No drinks were offered at this time. I do recall that there were a small number of sodas and an even smaller number of very small bottles of water on the gate desk as we were deplaning. This original number of drinks was not enough for everyone, and no other drinks were offered. This was late at a small airport, so there were no vendors open to offer other drink choices or food. Sometime between 11 pm and 12 am, we were informed that we would not be flying home to Orlando tonight, and that our rescheduled flight would be departing at 0537 am the next morning. We were informed that no hotel vouchers would be given. We were informed that we would have to go back to the pre-security area of the airport because we weren’t allowed to stay post-security through the night. We were also informed that we would all be given $100 in vouchers with Allegiant. Our party included 3 adults and 2 boys ages 3 and 6, and we were in a pre-security area. We were concerned about falling asleep while his children were there. We found an area of floor to try to get some sleep. For the next 2 hours, I attempted to get some sleep, but was unable to due to the airport getting colder and colder, and it being noisy and well lit. I got to the point where I was shivering, so I got up around 2:30 am. I went to the Allegiant check in desk, and found a staff member. He informed me that the manager never showed up, which was expected by the staff. He found my suitcase for me so I could get another sweatshirt and a beanie cap to keep warm. I went back to the room with my friends to try again to get some sleep. After a while I finally dozed off, to be awoken around 0400 am. We immediately went up to security, and went through, back to gate 5 to await our flight. $100 in vouchers, that we were given each, was just kicking us while we were down. I slept less than an hour prior to getting on that flight that morning. $100 in flight vouchers isn’t worth much. $100 in flight vouchers might cover a round trip flight somewhere, if I can find some of your lower cost fares that are going a place I want to go on one of your schedules that I can work with. This is assuming that I don’t want to check a bag.

### "100% satisfied with them"
Palm Beach to Asheville. Excellent service for a budget airline. No different than the ‘big ones’ out there. Cheap, but quality service. Allegiant gave me no issues rebooking my flight when my flight had the possibility of being redirected to a different airport. They even let me change it a second time without a change fee. They also accommodated my husband really well, they ended up refunding one of his tickets entirely and let him change another for free despite this not being their normal way of operating. The flights themselves are fine too, wonderful flight attendants and even the food and drinks aren’t that expensive to buy. The seats don’t recline, but they’re at a comfortable angle, something that’s great for a person with back issues like myself. It might become more uncomfortable on longer flights, but I only fly short flights with Allegiant. Flown a few times with them now and 100% satisfied with them. For a budget airline, they are on top of their game and give much more than I would otherwise expect from a budget airline. Will continue to fly with them for sure!

### "I got what I paid for"
So I'm addressing the complaints of all the people who clearly didn't take the time to read the fine print. This isn't a fancy airline, my ticket was $48. I wasn't expecting premium service, seats, or attendants and I got what I paid for, which was perfectly adequate in all 3 cases. Yes, they ding you on the luggage. The information is however, literally the 1st thing found when you google "baggage information Allegiant airline". It's 40 lbs per bag, not 50 so I spent 30 minutes the night before pitching things to make my 2 bags each go from 43 and 44 lbs, to 37 and 38, respectively. I carry a travel luggage scale with me (best $10 you'll ever spend) and if you don't have 1, Walmart carries them, they weigh about an ounce. Upgrade to a seat with more leg room, you'll be glad of it. For $48 I felt like I could afford it and was reasonably sure I wasn't going to have to cough up an extra $50 per bag at check in. Again, glad I did. No, there's no complimentary anything on these flights, but so what? Get food and bring it with you! There were no delays so I can't comment on that, but it does seem to be a problem with this airline. The attendants were quite friendly, no complaints there. I get it guys, you're there at check in thinking one thing, only to hear something else. Maybe it's because I travel a lot, but it was honestly the work of 30 seconds to find out they only honor 40 lbs on their check in bags and yeah, you bet I was grateful I'd looked ahead of time. When I got to Harrisburg I went to Walmart and restocked what I'd thrown out. Cost? $13.66. Sure beat that $100 I'd have had to give them if I'd not been paying attention.

### "never fly with them again"
Orlando to Evansville. In short I arrived at the gate for my flight at 12.33. Gates closed at 12.39. The girls at the gate told me my flight left at 12.30. Sent me downstairs. The flight had not left and this was misinformation that directly caused me to miss my flight. After one lie after another and changing stories to suit the airline I had to buy a new ticket. Airport manager told me the flight left early. Customer service (called them the next day) told me the flight did not leave early. I told him in short the girls at the gate mistakenly sent me away. By the time we realized they were mistaken it was now to late! He repeated over and over that the gate closed at 12:39. I said well it was 12:33. He then changed his story and said well that’s a different gate the other gate closed earlier. They offered me a generous discount of a $75 new flight ticket. When I looked up the app it was priced at $61. They did nothing to acknowledge or accommodate us. I have 4 more flights booked with Allegiant between now and Jan and I will never fly with them again when these are seen through.

### "no assistance with accommodation"
Not Verified | Flight straight through from St. Petersburg to Roanoke. The flight was fine until we arrived in Roanoke. Our arrival and upcoming landing were announced. We came into heavy clouds in and out. The passengers were aware something was going on, but we weren't receiving information. About 30 mins later we were informed that the landing wasn't a good idea at that time. We were going to fly into Knoxville, Tennessee. After 45 min. being held on the plane we were told there wasn't going to be an improvement in the weather in Roanoke anytime soon. We could get off the plane there without our luggage and no assistance with accommodation or we could fly back to St. Petersburg where they could possibly help with hotel and food. There were multiple passengers making phone calls and discussing options. It was difficult to hear my husband so we could make a decision. There was no guarantee we would fly out of Florida the next day either. We chose to get off the plane in Knoxville, rent a car and drive the 6 hrs home. We were given our luggage since there were several passengers who chose to do the same. My mother in law covered all expenses. If not I'm not sure how we would have managed.

### "I wasn’t able to make my first flight"
Phoenix to Redmond. My flight with disappointed me greatly with the circumstances which unfolded. I’m in the military and took a pass for the thanksgiving holiday to spend time with my family. I choose Allegiant due to the more reasonable flight prices. This flight gave me the ability to leave Wednesday afternoon and return late Sunday night. Due to military training running late I wasn’t able to make my first flight to meet my family and had to purchase a ticket for the following day. I don’t blame this on Allegiant which is why I was more than willing to purchase my one way ticket getting me home for the holiday the following day. As I have purchased a round trip ticket as long as I get home my return flight has been paid for and I will be able to use it to get back to my duty station. Come time to check in Sunday morning for my late afternoon flight my reservation, I already paid for, popped up as cancelled. Leaving me stranded without a way to get back to work. I called Allegiant immediately to inquire as to why I no longer had a reservation for my seat I paid for as a customer, they said they reserved the right to void my purchase and keep the funds without telling me about it. Essentially saying I, as the paying customer of a service am required to communicate, but Allegiant does not have to communicate. Allegiant left me no choice but for me to pay for another one way ticket for a seat on a flight I already paid for. Moving forward allegiant will not be an airline I look to recommend as an airline I can trust or be reliable for myself, friends, family, or my Soldiers.

### "polite and extremely helpful"
Not Verified |  Savannah to Cleveland. Great experience flying with them. The flight attendants were all very polite and extremely helpful. Food price is as expected for an airline. They don’t serve free food but it’s fair since the tickets are so cheap. Overall, it was a great experience for my family and I. It was my sons first time flying and the flight attendants got them to see the cockpit and meet the captains. Very cool.

### "Never again Allegiant Air"
We fly Allegiant from Harrisburg to Orlando Sanford several times a year. Today will be our last. We had a 6 hour delay leaving Harrisburg for “engine repairs”. Now we get to Sanford to go hone and were very rudely handled by staff at the check in counter, the rudest customer service person I’ve ever dealt with. Now we just saw our 5pm flight is delayed till 7:30! Everyone always says “get what you pay for”. Allegiant air is the epitome of that statement. Extremely rude customer service at their airport, phone customer service that runs you around in a phone loop and then hangs up and now flights delayed. Never again Allegiant Air. Where I come from if you treat customers like this, you are out of business.

### "Travel protection was joke"
Not Verified |  Indianapolis to Orlando. I needed to cancel our vacation plans. I only received a travel voucher and no refund option even with travel protection. There needs to be a huge screen that pops up to warn people who book that if you don’t go, you won’t get your money back even when you have the travel protection. I told them I don’t fly on a regular basis. I was a single mother trying to take a vacation; however, I had to cancel due to the cancellation of my sick family member. This airline deserves to go under. I give them 0/10 because their rude service, claiming that it was clearly stated on the website (which it is, hidden like teir contact information) and I waited on the phone for 28 minutes to not even have the chance to get my money refunded to help me out. Travel protection was joke.

### "This company is a sham"
Indianapolis to Las Vegas. I flew out on Friday 11/22/19 1:32pm and was immediately delayed. Once we got on the plane I realized a couple things there is no creature comforts as in the chair doesn’t recline, WiFi or even padding on the seat. This is an absolute joke, but this is where it gets even better. My brother passes away on Saturday morning unexpectedly or I wouldn’t have left home. My wife called multiple times to get us home ASAP and was told we needed a death certificate no problem I will produce it when I receive it we called the same day Of his passing. Nor was I looking for a refund or sympathy I Just needed to get home. Well the best they could is get us on the Monday flight at 11:37am and we were delayed again til 8:30pm. I will not get home till 3am and have funeral arrangements to make at 8am Tuesday. This is absolutely the most ridiculous encounter I have ever been involved in with a corporation. I will continue to spend the extra money on a different reputable airline since I was not allowed to specifically name one I use frequently. This company is a sham.

### "flight was delayed 7 hours"
I took a flight last night from Allentown to Nashville. After being loaded onto the plane, they told us there was an oil leak and we could not leave. They were unable to find the mechanic for an hour. After sitting on the plane for over an hour, we were deplaned. We got notifications from our phone that it was delayed about an hour. This continued until the flight was delayed 7 hours. We were only offered a $50 voucher for waiting 7 hours. This was my first and last time using Allegiant.

### "We did not even get an explanation"
Not Verified |  Extremely disappointed with Allegiant Air. I will not suggest this airline to anyone. It will be my absolute last choice to ever fly with them again. Poor communication about delay. Kept setting back our delay. Ended up being over a 6 hour delay leaving us up the entire night. My total travel time was close to 11 hours. I could of driven to Grand Rapids in less time then it took to wait around for this flight that continued to get pushed back. They did nothing to work with us. We should be getting money back. This should not be happening. We did not even get an explanation of why we were delayed.

### "a pretty awful experience"
Not Verified |  Albany to Punta Gorda. Worst airline, worst travel experience ever. This was the classic "bait & switch" tactic. Allegiant reels you in with promises of inexpensive flights only to up-charge you on everything. Started out with 2 tickets for $107. By the time we were done, it was nearly $400. The 40lb. weight limit on bags is laughable and purely designed to get customers to pony up an additional $50 per bag for even the slightest overage. The check-in agents were rude ... one of them even caused a scene that led to the line being slowed for nearly 10 minutes. The planes are crammed with no room to place your carry-on under the seat. We were traveling with our small emotional support dog (which they charged us for despite documentation). He was in a carrier that fit the airline's prescribed parameters, but we couldn't get him far enough under the seat because of the limited space. The flight attendant told us he needed to go further under the seat, but that was impossible. We finally convinced her we couldn't get him any further under the seat without hurting him, but she didn't make it easy. The plane took forever to take off as we sat for quite sometime before we even began to taxi. All in all, it was a pretty awful experience. As one commenter mentioned, you shouldn't waste your money. Fly a real airline instead. It really made us appreciate airlines like Southwest so much more. I've deleted the Allegiant app from my phone. I only wish I could delete any memory of this travel experience.

### "Worst airline experience"
Not Verified |  Ft Lauderdale to Indianapolis. Force you to put your carry on in a tiny, undersized test bin before boarding - only to be forced to pay more - even if it would have fitted on the plane. The test bin is intentionally smaller than the overhead compartments. Baggage claim takes forever, gate agents are rude and flight attendants are rude. Worst airline experience by far.

### "Had an excellent flight"
Had an excellent flight on Allegiant Air from Oakland to Vegas 11/15/19. Staff took the time to talk to our party and make us feel welcome as well as gave some amazing recommendations for places to stop by while in Las Vegas. Put a great face on Allegiant Air and would definitely have me recommending Allegiant to friends based on their excellent hospitality and service! 5 stars - would fly again!

### "said you lose that money"
Las Vegas to Pasco. Booked flight, paid, immediately got call I couldn't make it. Called them with 15 minutes, asked to be moved or refunded. They said you lose that money but we can rebook you for same price but of course you'll have to pay. So i just called Delta and they hooked it up. Pretty gross way to handle customers.

### "Over 13 hours in airport!"
Belleville to Destin. Over 13 hours in airport! Repeated mechanicals different planes- no updates to times - staff rude and told we would board the plane when it got here. Flight was 2pm. It is now 4am. Never again!

### "use a reliable airline"
Not Verified | Punta Gorda to Columbus. Every time we fly Allegiant it is delayed. Always. The seats are crammed and uncomfortable. I am not sure what the money for our flights pays for other than the salary of the workers. Some of the times you spend more time on the plane waiting for take-off then actually on the flight. The attendents have no answers and I don't think it's because they aren't telling us it's because no one is telling them. I would rather spend more money to drive further and use a reliable airline. Don't waste your money.

### "fly a real airline"
Phoenix to Provo. Another Allegiant flight, majority delayed and now we get to unload and get on another plane. I don't have a lot of confidence we'll get out of here. Spend the extra money and fly a real airline!

### "extremely helpful and nice"
Sanford to Indianapolis. Courtney & Sebastian were so very nice to me and my dog Lollipop. They were extremely helpful and nice. Apparently, I didn't fill out the correct paperwork to have my service dog go with me on the flight. My friend was still waiting for me, because I never took my service dog. Next time I'll fill out proper paperwork. Lollipop did so incredible when I was in hospital for 4 months and I was really proud of her going through security and Airport. She got very nervous up Escalade and doesn't like elevators. Just want to thank Courtney & Sebastian again for helping me make my flight and being extremely nice and professional. Keep up the kindness and professionalism.

### "24 hours delay"
Not Verified |  Cincinnati to Destin. This company needs to go out of business. 24 hours delay (not canceled) and still delayed out of the gate by over an hour. NO customer service, no explanation, no assistance. Had to pay for a hotel out of my own pocket for my elderly mother.

### "charges you for every little thing"
Tulsa to Las Vegas. They get you under the guise of cheap flights but charges you for every little thing. Boarding passes are $5. You have to pay for carry on bags. Pre-paid $30 for a checked bag, get to the gate and my luggage is 45lbs. Every other airline is 50lbs, but Allegiant limit is 40lbs. They charged me $50 for the extra 5lbs.

### "Priority boarding and drinks included"
Punta Gorda to Harrisburg. Living near one of the Allegient Air airport routes (15 min from home), our family has travelled 10-15 times from Allentown, PA to Punta Gorda and from Punta Gorda to Harrisburg, PA to visit son at college. We knew ahead of time the airline was no frills and gets from point a to point b. I have never had any issues with the airline and instead have seen multiple flights take off and land ahead of time. Once they have the plane boarded, they are free to take off which ends up with early arrival. I recommend purchasing the tickets at the airport whenever possible as they will exclude the tax which is about $35-40 per RT ticket. We also use flex trip which allows for unlimited changes to your flight. The seats on all aircraft I’ve flown have been redone however still do not recline which some look at as a problem (unless your the 6’4 person behind the recliner). For flights that are less than 2.5 hours, this airline has been better than average and much more convenient than driving from Newark or Phila on east to take national brand carrier. We have also used their credit card which pays for itself after the first flight. Priority boarding and drinks included with credit card as well as credit to be used on any portion of future ticket. Both kids are in college and have airports within 20 minutes where Allegiant flies to our home area. I’ve been platinum on other name brand airlines and have chosen Allegiant for these regional flights which have made life much easier for our family. The delays mentioned on reviews are I’m sure real however weather in some of those areas would have any airline grounded. Hopefully Allegient Air can get their act together with this and come up with a stronger marketing campaign to advance their efficient brand.

### "On time and friendly"
Not Verified |  Asheville to Sanford. On time and friendly. The hidden fees are not hidden if one reads everything prior to booking. Cancellation policies are clearly stated as are the different types of refunds. Seating policies are also clearly stated. Booking at same time and then “hoping” to be together is a guarantee of unhappiness. I believe many frustrated passengers are simply not reviewing the policies of Allegiant. This is a company in business to make money by offering true budget flight options. If you want frills go with a different airline.

### "Horrible communication"
Not Verified |  Bellingham to Las Vegas with Allegiant Air. Horrible communication, delayed flight for 12 hours. Customer service continues to flail arms while just asking for updates. Terrible experience. $16 food voucher for 12 hour delay when the cheapest item in restaurant is $16.50. 0 compensation. I appreciate cheap flights but this company has no class.

### "Every little thing costs extra"
Not Verified |  Redmond to Las Vegas. Allegiant was terrible. Flights weren’t on time, no complimentary drinks/snacks, gave me a hard time for not taking facial cleansing wipes out of my bag. Wasn’t enough room for everyone’s carry-on luggage. Also, their carry on size is way smaller than other airlines so if your carry on fits on a different airline it doesn’t mean it will with them. Every little thing costs extra, by the time you pay for it’s around the same price to fly with a better airline.

### "haven't been disappointed yet"
Sarasota to Richmond. I have flown on Allegiant airlines five times now and haven't been disappointed yet. Staff even went out of their way to help me figure out a problem with my allegiant app. For a low cost airline Allegiant air is definitely the best deal for your money. I would highly recommend them.

### "attendants are the rudest"
Mesa to Provo. I have flown this route a few times and I will say that the flight attendants are the rudest and nastiest people in the industry. Rather than communicate professionally and assume the best the flight attendants verbally jump on customers about their regulations. I’m sure that they have a lot of crazy people they deal with but chill out. I hope the attendants can find joy in the journey. I’m sure it comes from the management and translates down to the customers and you do get what you pay for. I’m so glad that there are other choices.

### "has gone downhill over the years"
Not Verified |  Have flown several different times throughout the years. It was a great deal back then, but has gone downhill over the years. First, the price has sky rocketed with no additional services, you do not get peanuts or a drink without paying additionally for them now! The flight attendants were more interested in taking selfies than attending to the passengers. It is not fun to fly this airline and unless absolutely necessary I will not go on this airline again. Actually, its much cheaper nowadays to take a few extra days and just drive, my husband and I could have left Wednesday and got to Vegas Thursday afternoon. Stayed until Sunday and been home Monday evening for half the cost of this flight and hotel accommodations at the Luxor. At the Resort the room was shabby, popcorn ceilings were falling down, room smelled musty, asked for a King Size Bed but had to settle for a Queen size, I paid for a package deal which cost us over $1500 for 3 nights and the hotel charged another $150 for resort fees for no additional services. We will not choose this again there are many better places to stay and for a better value. Done with Allegiant unless its the only thing available.

### "total train wreck"
Not Verified |  Asheville to Ft Lauderdale. I have tried to stay loyal, but every flight we take is delayed multiple times. You get the feeling you're living in the airport. I am finally finished with Allegiant. I know people put negative feedback because they get aggravated but I fly monthly with Allegiant. The reviews are true. A total train wreck. I'm out. Peace

### "I hate this airline"
Albuquerque to Las Vegas. Absolutely horrible company to fly with! They will sing you and charge you to breath. Forget about being on time. My flight is 9 hours late. It finally arrives and there is another maintenance delay on the airplane. The freaking airplane doesn’t work! What a ridiculous joke. But hey, there brought pizza! I will never fly with this atrocious company again! Hopefully I can do all I can to deter anyone from ever flying with this stupid company ever again! I hate this airline!

### "everything on my trip was perfect"
Nashville to Sarasota., I’m terrified of flying, and everything on my trip was perfect. Smooth, quick, and easy. I would definitely recommend this airline to others. And I’ll be flying again soon.

### "staff courteous"
Punta Gorda to Pittsburgh. Airline staff on ground and in flight courteous. However, expect to wait, wait and wait if you have any need that must be addressed via telephone. Over an hour for me personally. Multiple occasions. Biggest Complaint" is being forced to pay an additional $112 this trip to pick up a rental vehicle at PIT airport that was prepaid many days earlier and itinerary updates up to a few hours prior to flight verified the original charges. This was all booked in advance using my Allegiant app. Very dishonest to take advantage of a person away with an expectation that proper planning was done to secure transportation. You can either pay extra unexpected charges to get the vehicle you reserved or Walk away without it.

### "just let it be over soon"
Not Verified |  Medford to Los Angeles. This is the first time I had flown Allegiant Airlines. Ticket counter agents seemed to take longer to process people than other airlines. While waiting at the gate, the time became close to boarding time, but nothing happened, no announcements, etc. The time eventually even passed takeoff time with everyone still waiting to board and no announcements regarding the delay. Finally, we boarded the plane an hour after scheduled takeoff time and the captain on board the plane explained over the intercom that something happened earlier in the day to throw off the schedule and "they hoped to make it up to us in the future" (an odd statement, given that it is impossible to make up a time delay). So we are an hour behind our takeoff time and the ticket agent (now on board the plane) begins to call out particular passenger names to see if these people are on board. I'm wondering, wouldn't they already know who's onboard from the tickets being scanned at the gate? Then the same agent begins going down the rows, one by one, saying the first name of each passenger that is supposed to be in that seat and wanting those passengers to confirm their identity. I had never seen this before in all my years of flying (I'm 58 years old). I'm thinking, there must be an easier way! I took some Benadryl prior to the flight for allergies, hoping that it would knock me out and I would have a blissful nap en route but, lo and behold, the seats don't recline, even the slightest bit (no button on the armrests, etc.). When did this become normal? How am I supposed to nod off in the full upright position? The seats are also thinner (less cushion) than those of other airlines. Oh well, I'll just read the inflight magazine. But it is very thin as well, more like a pamphlet, without any interesting articles. I look at the beverages available on the flight and I see that there is a charge for everything. Not even a free soda like other airlines. Aren't sodas about 12 cents a can when purchased in bulk? Well, I'm not paying $3 for a 12 cent soda! Apparently I'm not the only fussy passenger - there is a baby behind me that starts crying which inspires other babies to start crying. Unfortunately, they are healthy babies with lots of energy and they don't stop crying for most of the remainder of the flight. I'm thinking, "Oh please, God, just let it be over soon". We finally touch down. Babies still crying. One hour after our scheduled departure time. Never again.

### "Would not recommend"
Not Verified |  Tucson to Provo. The crew was rude, especially one flight attendant. Allegiant does the bare minimum and doesn’t care about their customers whatsoever. They charge for every little thing so they advertise and cheap and affordable, when really they are the same price as any other airline. Would not recommend.

### "issues with myallegiant website"
FT Lauderdale to Knoxville. This my seem trite, but has anyone experienced issues with being able to view and or change their flights through manage travel on myallegiant website. I have had this issue since December 2018. When logging in I receive an error message that reads: An unexpected error has occurred and we are looking into it. Please try again later. I have been receiving this message since December 2018. I have talked, chatted and emailed Allegiant multiple times and keep getting blown off. This may seem trivial, but I will tell you this, when you are attempting to evacuate your daughter from a hurricane and relying on Allegiant website to manage and change flights it becomes much more. The last time this happened, just recently during Hurricane Dorian, I had to phone customer service, I was on hold for over three hours in the middle of the night before I needed to evacuate her and when I finally reached the agent and explained my situation the agent hung up on me. I can assure you I was courteous and professional while attempting to remedy the situation. This is in no way how anyone should be treated during a difficult time such as this. Thankfully for my daughter things worked out ok. I would hate to think someone in a much more affected area had the same plight.

### "changed my seat"
Not Verified |  Reno to Las Vegas. I reserved a seat by paying money for my return flight. Then they have changed my seat and didn’t even let me know. What is the purpose of ‘reserve’ by paying money?

### "a very stressful situation"
St Pete Clearwater to South Bend. The original flight for me was to return on August 28th. We left with plenty of time to spare. Traffic was backed up and horrendous. There was a very bad accident on the freeway, and we made it to the airport at 8:45am. The plane was to leave at 9:00am. My daughter and I had no bags to check and I was already prechecked in and ready to go. We knew it was a longshot, but we went straight to the gate just to see if I can make it. We were informed that the plane had already left. We looked at our app that had originally still said 9:00 AM it changed to the plane had left at 8:51 AM. We remained calm and went to the ticket counter to see what could be done. As time passed and the lady continued to attempt to help us, she let us know we would be charged 75 dollars as a comp fee for a flight on Saturday. We immediately felt upset and I had a panic attack. People behind us had also missed their flight and began to complain. The woman and another woman behind the counter began to become upset with those of us that missed our flight stating that we should have been there two hours prior. We asked to speak to a manager. The second woman kept saying “well many others were here on time, they were two hours early as you should have been, we can’t hold the plane for you”. We kept saying “we know you can’t hold the plane that’s not what we’re asking we don’t understand why we have to pay again when it’s not our fault that we missed“. We explained to the lady that we did not want to compare ourselves to others that were not on the road when we were on the road that were not affected by the accident like we were affected. She appeared to have no remorse. As they began to get a manager they asked those of us that missed the flight to step aside to another side and that we would be served once he came to the counter. A family came up and got in line and it had been maybe two minutes before a gentleman came to the counter, one of the people who missed their flight was a little old woman who went up to him thinking he must be the manager. However they told her that she needed to wait her turn that those behind her were actually in line, and had been waiting an hour to check in for their flight. Although maybe their perception of an hour is different or maybe it was the stress, but those people had just gotten there and those of us that were waiting for figuration of our missed flight and the cost of a second flight since it was not our fault that we missed our plane, we had only been waiting maybe 30 minutes if not less. What seemed like an eternity during the situation was really not that long, and those of us that had missed our flight were the only ones standing in line until they moved us aside and a family came up right behind us. Overall it was a very stressful situation with customers just wanting some clarification and understanding from the company and workers of the company just not having remorse and probably feeling stressed themselves as well. Overall the manager came and comped to all the flights for free for those of us who were involved in the freeway of the accident that had occurred and we were not able to make it to the airport. Although we greatly appreciate the consideration and understanding and compassion of their manager it still can’t be helped to feel uncomfortable or uneasy and just simply sad and stressed over it all.

### "horrible customer service"
Not Verified | St. Petersburg to Cedar Rapids. Bottom feeder of all airlines. Make their money off of people who have no convenient routing. PIE horrible customer service. Phone lines even worse.

### "what I was expecting"
It was fine. Exactly what I was expecting. A $115 direct flight between Indianapolis and Austin. The seats were uncomfortable and the FAs were largely disengaged, remaining in the galley for the entire flight, save for the one drink service. I paid the $6 for early boarding. And I paid extra for more leg room. I'm only 5' 9" but I have back problems. All in all, I got exactly what I was expecting, not much.

### "They simply don't care"
Not Verified |  Allegiant Air's lack of a meaningful, real time complaint process speaks volumes regarding the company's total lack of concern regarding the treatment their passengers receive. You cannot phone in a complaint at all. Their live chat is limited to business hours, Monday thru Friday. Other wise, you can snail mail, or email. The email form provided is not designed for complaints, quite the opposite. I was moved from a premium seat I paid for to an inferior seat because of my oxygen concentrator. The only thing they did was refund the $15. Absolutely no other concerns as to how that decision was made, it's effect on me and my health, nothing. They simply don't care.

### "flight has been delayed 3 times"
Bellingham to Las Vegas. Absolute worst airline ever! We have spent much the whole day at the airport because our flight has been delayed 3 times. This is inexcusable. How can they think that it is ok to mess with people's lives like this! We only had two days in Vegas with one day spent at the G#D Dam# airport because this airline can not seem to get their act together! We will never fly with this poor excuse of a company ever again! There are plenty of choices out there. I would rather pay more than to put up with this garbage.

### "charge you for everything"
No curbside checkin you can see the line to expect leaving from FLL. Arrive 2 hours in advance for domestic flights only to have your flights delayed(see attached). They let a passenger onboard who was not supposed to be on the flight we were on and the only reason they figured it out was because the seat had been sold to someone else. You cannot even take a nap on your flight because the flight attendants are broadcasting and distributing snacks in a loud manner If you have another airline you can choose (which I didn't flying to Asheville besides Spirit) easy choice, anything but Allegiant. Every seat on the airline is the same (seats do not move no leg room or place to fit a water bottle on the A320), they try and fit as many people on the plane it seems and delay departure times to fill every seat. Best of all they charge you for everything. Bring snacks

### "Absolutely horrible"
Not Verified |  Belleville to Punta Gorda. Absolutely horrible. Taken this flight twice in 60 days. Both times it was 7 hrs late. Sitting at Belleville airport now with hundreds of stranded people due to 5 late Allegiant flights.

### "We had a great experience"
Kansas City to Destin. I would strongly recommend flying with Allegiant. We had a great experience. Greg the flight attendant was the nicest attendant we have encountered, Our flight was a very nice one, all the other staff were very nice too. We got a very good deal and very nice prices for our tickets, and luggage. It was a nice non stop flight from KC to FL. We will definitely fly again with Allegiant this was our first time using this airline.

### "fly someone else"
Orlando to Knoxville. Orlando check in is awful. The lady named Joe was miserable. 40lb limit is a joke. If the is any other way, fly someone else. Flights are cheap so expect cheap.

### "had such a delightful experience"
Not Verified |  My husband and children traveled from Sanford, Florida to Niagara Falls, NY on August 2nd 2019 in the early am (6:27am) and we had such a delightful experience today. The flight crew Kristen, Michelle and the other two lovely ladies went out of their way to make this flight perfect! I had an emergency happen and needed a personal hygiene product and the girls came to my rescue! They were so interactive with my two children and made my girls feel so comfortable during the flight. Allegiant Air is our carrier of choice as it’s close and convenient to where we live in Lake Mary, FL! And I just want to give a shout out to the entire crew for a job well done! !

### "comment about the wonderful experience"
Newark to Destin Fort Walton. I just had to comment about the wonderful experience my husband and I had. Everyone was so friendly and courteous! When we added a carryon the woman helping us took the time to show us how to do it online in order to save $60. Also, there was a stewardess who went out of her way to help those with small children. We look forward to using them again in the future As for the person who said they nickle and dime everything, I lived the large selection of snacks they offered. $2.00 for a Diet Pepsi was very reasonable! !

### "Nickel & dime you"
Las Vegas to Medford. Literally the worst experience I've had flying over 10 airlines. Nickel & dime you to the point you wouldn't believe! $118 for a carry on duffle bag. and small backpack, $3 for mini water ! It gets worse, 60 minutes did a show on just how bad they are.

### "Horrible experience"
Phoenix to Central Nebraska. My daughter was scheduled to fly from Mesa to Grand Island. She arrived at airport, checked her bag, ( which they took and put on the flight!) went through customs, got to her terminal and was told they closed it and wasn’t allowed on! The people who work there were terribly rude to her. First, why would they allow your luggage to go on the flight if they were no longer taking passengers, second, she was not they only one this happened to, there were 5 other people they did this to. We have used Their airline many times, this was the first incident we’ve had. Very disappointed in their customer service. Horrible experience for a lot of people that day!

### "Never will fly them again!"
Not Verified |  St Pete/Clearwater to Norfolk. I traveled on July 18, 2019. The Allegiant staff at St. Petersburg/Clearwater Airport in Florida were extremely rude and impatient. They apparently have no skill level in how to communicate with customers in a civil manner. Thor demands were rigid and not accommodating to the customer. No attempt was made by 2 of the staff to timely check in customers. Cramped seating! Never will fly them again!

### "super price, free checked bags"
Phoenix to Grand Junction. I was thrilled to find these tickets - super price, free checked bags and carryon bag if you bring your veteran card or DD214, 3 miles from my home, and the Allegiant employees were professional and efficient. Cons do include the inconvenience of waiting in line. You must pay a fee if you want seat assignment. There’s not even water available without a fee. The seats are very narrow. Tips: get there early. Don’t take an over-weight bag. Get your bags tagged. Enjoy the cheap flight.

### "Everything went without a hitch"
I have seen a lot of negative reviews about Allegiant and I have to admit that it was with some trepidation that I decided to take a trip with them. I don't normally submit a review but I wanted to share my experience. The fee-happy structure is intimidating and your experience can be different than what you are used to on another airline. At the Airport, plan for more time at the ticket counter. Individual flights seem to have their own line. Don't get in the wrong line. Plan on more time with the ticket counter agent. If you are checking a bag or carrying on a bag, they will review this information with you. You will receive a tag for your carry on. Your carry on luggage may well be considered "too large" and will need to be checked. Similarly, your checked bag can only be 40 lbs (most airlines give you 50 lbs). Make sure your luggage conforms to their published dimensions and weight. What is considered carry-on size for Delta may need to be checked on Allegiant. There is a lot of homework to do or you could end up with an unpleasant surprise. What I found that WAS a very pleasant surprise is that if you are a veteran and can prove it - you can check up to 3 bags and a carry on for FREE! It is the most generous offering in the industry. There are other perks for veterans too, so check their website for a full,detailed list. The flight was on time, the flight crew was pleasant. They made it quite clear that nothing on that beverage and snack cart was free and they went through the cabin very quickly. It was easy to move around since the the carts swept through the cabin much quicker than airlines which give complimentary snacks and beverages. The chairs (I won't call them seats) were narrow, hard and did not recline. For the hour flight we had, it was fine. For the price, I did not mind at all. For my destination, they make only two flights per week. Its a little scary to think about a cancelled flight, so that is a risk you must be willing to take. Everything went without a hitch and i got to spend a great weekend with my friends and I could not have driven there for the cost of the flight. With their generous perks for veterans and the attractive pricing, I am for sure, a satisfied Allegiant customer.

### "just told no as an answer"
Sanford to Rochester. I have booked many trips on Allegiant as I book for a construction crew and for myself. I have enjoyed the prices that they offer and always get Trip Flex for bookings. A couple weeks ago, I booked a business trip for myself to go to Rochester. Today, I learned that my colleague's mother is in heart failure and wanted to change my flight to next week to allow him to have time to gather himself. A simple task? Well apparently, somehow I did not purchase Trip Flex this time and I discovered this when trying to change the flight to next week. I tried to call and chat to get help. I typically use Allegiant or Southwest depending upon the city that I am going to. Well, it is almost an hour later and am still on hold waiting for a human. Octavia came onto the chat with me 30 minutes after trying to initiate a chat. I can tell you that my level of frustration was already elevated. When I explained the situation the attitude was less than having any interest in helping me and I got links to terms and conditions. I was not given the opportunity to speak to a supervisor and was just told no as an answer. I will tell you that I have spent almost 5k dollars in the past 6 months booking flights on Allegiant but will no longer utilize them based on their inflexibility. I have never asked for any special treatment and needed some help this one time. What a business model! Instead of trying to get a supervisor, they simply disconnected the chat. I did not use profanity of any kind and was simply demanding to speak to someone who would help me. Octavia did not say she was disconnecting as she could not help me or anything else. She simply and abruptly disconnected the chat! What kind of customer service and lack of compassion is this? I can assure you that I will spend a tiny bit more with a competitor to have the flexibility that I need.

### "this airline is a joke"
❎ Not Verified | Myrtle Beach to Allentown. Truly the most disorganized experience I’ve ever had, and this applies both to and from our destination. Both times aircraft were not fueled enough to make the trip so passengers waited over an hour for take off. By the time the aircraft was fueled a storm hit and we not only had to sit on the plane and for an additional hour but the route was changed extending the flight by half an hour. Staff was completely unprofessional also. If you have any other option, take it, this airline is a joke.

### "was very rude to me"
Las Vegas to Oakland. The person in charge of the boarding process was very rude to me and my friends . I fly with Allegiant all the time and generally I find good affordable deals! Other than the couple times my flight has got canceled, but I’ve managed to accommodate. However the service I’ve had today was unbelievable, not only was she rude but she made me and my friends step out of line for no apparent reason. It’s one thing if we’re doing something wrong but at least treat us with respect.

### "ended up only being refunded $28"
I had to cancel my trip due to health concerns. Online I was told several different refund amounts. I paid over $200 for my flight originally and ended up only being refunded $28. I canceled 14 days before the flight date. Don't ever try to contact the customer service line, 1-702-505-8888. I was on hold for over 90 minutes and eventually hung up because I got no where. I never even spoke to a representative. Smaller airline companies such as Spirit and Frontier blow this company out of the water, and believe me those other 2 airline companies are't anything special to write home about. If you have two legs I would recommend walking to your destination before taking this airline.

### "told that the plane already left"
Not Verified |  My father and niece were scheduled to have a flight, they arrived early and checked in via app. While in line to verify If the bags were ok to carry on, there were people being pulled from the line because there were planes boarding for other locations. Then a lady behind us asked the lady if she could skip the line because she had a flight that left in 15 minutes. The manager asked her where she was going and told her she had plenty of time because all of Allegiant was using 1 gate and there was a line of planes. So after paying $50 more for a carry on bag, my family arrived to the gate only to be told that the plane already left. They also charge for everything. Need a boarding pass? $5 need to bring a carry on? $50. They would not even refund the $50 for the carry on that was just paid for. On top of that, good luck getting in contact with the 702-505-8888 customer service department

### "Worst service and experience"
My wife has been waiting since 4 pm to leave Ft Lauderdale to Ashville. Just advised (9:30 pm) will be 3:30 am before departure. Worst service and experience in 50 years.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Not Verified |  Bismarck to Phoenix. Very disappointed in the late notice for the rescheduling of my flight. They first delayed my plane and I received plenty of notice. However, they don’t notify you if the plane is cancelled. They didn’t email or call and waited till I was at the airport to cancelled. It’s very unprofessional and for such a price, I’d hope for better customer service.

### "the worst experience ever"
Had the worst experience ever. I paid for priority check in and They had me standing in line letting all the regular passengers go before us. By the time they called me it was an hour before my flight was scheduled to depart. They said I was late and wouldn’t let me board. They told me since I got there an hour before instead of two hours prior I forfeited my flight. They kept my money and they also kept my car rental money, since I did it with them. It felt like a scam. They were extremely rude and unwilling to help accommodate us. I was traveling with two minors. This airline’s staff was extremely unprofessional. The first thing the girl at the counter asked me, was if I had rented a car through them. As soon as they saw that I had a car rented through them, they pushed to make us miss the flight. It turns out that I called enterprise and I had the right to cancel and get full credit until 8PM. However, since I did it through air allegiant I couldn’t. They have to do it. This is probably why they were unwilling to help us make the flight. I tried to get someone on the phone and explain my situation and they just don’t care. The plane was empty, it was a local flight, they had an hour before take off, and they didn’t help me. I felt like if I was in the twilight zone. Don’t waste your money or your time.

### "never use this airline again"
Not Verified |  Little Rock to Los Angeles: June 19-22. Paid to check luggage $70 round trip. Luggage never arrived in LA. Customer service lied about getting my luggage there by Fedex the next day. As of this day, I have not seen my luggage. Contacting Allegiant by phone is a nightmare. Had to buy clothes to put on. The cheap route is not a good route. Will never use this airline again. First time and last time.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Rapid City to Las Vegas. Flight was late leaving Rapid City so we ended up paying for an extra day of parking, paid for an extra night at the hotel that wasn't needed because we arrived so late. Flight was one of the most horrible experiences I've ever had. Leaving Las Vegas was delayed 2.5 hours and we were given no explanation of why when our plane was already in Las Vegas and the weather was clear. Terrible customer service as well - no representative at the gate until 10 minutes prior to boarding and then boarding was delayed another 30 minutes while we all were standing around waiting. At the end of the trip we did not save any more money or time by flying Allegiant. Last time I will waste my money and time with this company.

### "all around horrible experience"
Not Verified |  My fiancé and I took Allegiant Air from Vegas to Memphis for our Wedding. We had our two kids with us as well so believe me when I say we arrived in plenty of time. Upon arriving to check our bags with Allegiant the line at McCarren airport was out the door with only two people checking in bags. We stood in line for so long that I had to pretend I was handicapped to make the flight for our wedding and was only able to do so because I had my dress as a carry on. While giving our bags to check in (which I had checked one online and we had to check another) I was told I did not pre pay for a checked bag ($35) which we had done everything online and had our confirmation. Also, we paid over $700 over three months ago for our family of four to fly to Memphis again and they had us on standy! We had to literally beg for our seats on this flight. Absolute horrible experience from the get go. On the way back to Vegas, Memphis airport only had 1 person checking in bags! We were in line again for over an hour! Also, we tried once again to pre check bags since it’s cheaper, this time it would not let us pre check ANYTHING or even check in early because we had our children with us and they had placed us all in different seats. So, due to Allegiant Ais inefficiency, we were over charged on this trip over $100 because of luggage, their inadequate app they try to get you to use and double charging us for luggage. This was an all around horrible experience and we will never fly Allegiant again. Much better off paying the extra money and being comfortable and taken care of on a Southwest or Delta flight.

### "cost me a lot more in the end"
Fort Lauderdale to CincinnatiStaff at bag check was rude and way behind schedule. Flight was delayed 45 mins and they did not even consider it a delay, I guess because this is their normal? No big deal. Had a okay flight, little bumpy but I wasn’t as phased as many. Ready to get back home, waited for checked bag for almost an hr. Grab it, scuff marks down the back of the suitcase and handle bent it is now not functional. Made a claim, as well all know suitcases are pricey, they state it varies from what damage they would intend to see if they were responsible. Long story short they won’t be covering a thing! Be careful, my “cheap” flight cost me a lot more in the end. (All of this after changing my original flight by five hrs a month before take off)

### "a cheaper experience"
Not Verified |  Las Vegas to Boise. The aircraft was not very comfortable and of course everything including snacks and drinks are extra. The computers were down at the airport and the line was huge waiting to check bags. Not enough staffing at the baggage check desk and generally not very impressed by the overall quality of the flight experience with Allegiant Air. I will not fly with them again because they tout amazing deals on flights, but you always get what you pay for and the cheaper tickets is equivalent to a cheaper experience.

### "I saved money and time"
I’m going to tell you about my experience flying with Allegiant Air. First, I was so sceptical about it, I was worried if we would get to our destination because it was so cheap and it’s a direct flight from Savannah to Albany. At first, I booked our flight using another airline and the total was $1471 and we had to stop in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Allegiant Air flight was so much cheaper, for 4 of us only cost $580. So, I canceled the other airline tickets and booked with Allegiant Air. Our flight went smoothly from Savannah to Albany, no delay and the flight attendants were super nice to us, even the pilots. So from now on if there is an Allegiant Air going where I want to go I’ll always use this airlines. Yes, they charge you for your snacks and drinks but hey for the money I save that’s no problem to me. I rate them 10/10. Great, great experienced, I saved money and time.

### "worst flight experienced"
Kansas City to Punta Gorda. As I arrived at the airport I was notified that the flight was delayed 2 hour late. No explanation why. 2 hours later I was again notified by text that the flight was delayed another 2 hours for a total delay of 4 hours. I called the airline to see if I could take a different flight in the morning because my mom and dad would have to pick me up at the airport at 1:04 AM instead of 9:22 PM. I was on hold for over an hour and finally gave up on that. Once in the air. I was never offered a refreshment from a flight attendant. in fact was never even offered a glance from any of the 4 attendants despite having paid a premium to sit in Seat 1D first row isle. Attendants sat up front and conversed with each other the whole flight. At 12:20 the pilot announced that we could not land at punta gorda airport and will be diverted to St Petersburg 2.5 hours from Punta Gorda. We were told that they had no way to transport us from there, there were no rental cars available. My Mom and Dad had to drive 2.5 hours to pick me up and 2.5 hours home. The worst flight I have ever experienced. This company should be shut down.

### "Horrible experience"
Arizona to Bozeman with Allegiant Air. Horrible experience. Plane was delayed 2 hours. Said we were switching planes then said never mind and we continued to wait another hour. Do not recommend.

### "no more to drink for you girls"
Punta Gorda to Lexington . Customer service on plane was very poor. My sisters and i were in our way to Punta Gorda to visit with our sister and as we were getting seated on plane in Lexington the stewardess looked at us when we were sitting down and said no more to drink for you girls - just because we were laughing and cutting up. Yet a guy 2 seats up was staggering and spilled his drink and he was still served.

### "additional fees for baggage"
Not Verified |  Ft Lauderdale to Covington. We waited in line for over an hour and there were no Allegiant workers at the desk even checking customers in for their flights. Not one worker. On our flight here the staff were rude when we checked in. The quality of the plane was poor, and there were additional fees for baggage and refreshments on the plane which are typically complimentary with other airlines. Do not fly Allegiant.

### "every flight I've flown is delayed."
Las Vegas to Phoenix. Nearly every flight I've ever flown with them is delayed. And they don't let you know until the time the plane was scheduled to board passes. Don't try to make reservations or show tickets, because Allegiant is by far the most unreliable airline I've ever given the opportunity to earn my business.

### "worst customer service"
Fort Lauderdale to Asheville. This is by far the worst customer service I have experienced. I’ve flown with Allegiant 6 times since January 2019. There has been some sort of dilemma each and every time. I am currently on hold (and have been for 52 minutes) to simply get some information regarding a trip I have booked with them. I am also on their chat (which they advertise for faster service) and keep getting connected to “null” who does not reply to any of my messages. Spend the extra $100 to go with a better airline that cares about their customers or is at least staffed to take phone calls/chats for those customers that need help once they have purchased their tickets. Funny how simple it is to book a flight with them, but will have you burn your ear off waiting for someone to answer their customer service line. Thank god for speaker phone.

### "his company has no courtesy"
❎ Not Verified | Memphis to Fort Lauderdale with Allegiant Air. The customer service desk is the worst ever. My bag was overweight (71 lbs)and I understood that so I got to the side and started emptying it, the lady told me that I needed to get back at the end of the line, therefore I did. When I asked if I could weigh it to see how the weight was she told me I had to wait in line, so I did. When I got to the front of the line my bag was now (41.5 lbs) and she said that if I wanted to go through I had to pay $112. Therefore she made me go empty my bag and get back on the line. This company has no courtesy nor does it’s employees, worst company ever. I would not recommend anyone to fly with them, this is not the type of company that anyone should support.

### "no customer service"
Both fights were late. The bathroom was broken on the return flight. I ran into issue on the first flight and called to get assistance. I had all 4 family members calling because I could never get through. Only for no one to help . We call called back and were on hold for 47-72 min. All discussed the issue and again, no one would help until I became ugly with the person and told them I wanted a supervisor. During the time we were all holding I was trying to CHAT. Each time it would tell me it would be at least 16 min. Each time it would disconnect me. The is absolutely no customer service. After our return flight was delayed, bathroom broke, we have landed and not can’t get off the plane and were told it would be 20 min.

### "delay after delay"
Provo to Phoenix. This Airline is terrible, we have delay after delay after delay. It is currently delayed for 4 hours due to mechanical issues. Our flight at this time is due to depart at almost midnight. Not a single person has communicated any other options to fly out the next day. There are families with small children. We are all just sitting here with no other options but to wait and wait and wait..

### "Messed up our baggage claim"
Sarasota to Harrisburg. Messed up our baggage claim and then proceeded to make us wait to get our bag from someone who took them. No one at counter. Been waiting over an hour for our luggage. Worst service, slowest people, once they have your money they don’t care about you at all.

### "they don’t have a crew member"
Not Verified |  Indianapolis to Sarasota. I have long given Allegiant the benefit of the doubt but my patience has expired, too many delays and not because of weather but because they don’t have the crew to support flying on their jets, we are delayed once again because they don’t have a crew member here going on three hours delayed and weather is perfect and not departing any time soon. I’m very disappointed in Allegiant. Allegiant needs to employ more employees so that you can have the crew available that is required. I’m going to have to seriously consider to stop flying with Allegiant and i am a monthly+ flyer.

### "Good riddance Allegiant"
Oklahoma City to Orlando. Worse Customer Service I have ever experienced. Was on hold for an hour to reschedule an upcoming flight due to a family illness, staff  was rude and wanted to charge full price to reschedule, thats not going to happen! My family has used Allegiant multiple times in the past and will never use them again. Frontier is just as competitive and has much better customer service. Good riddance Allegiant.

### "costs more in time and aggravation"
Cincinnati to Ft Lauderdale. 8:00 am departure, now 4th delay leaving at 4:30. How is that ok? I asked gate agent after first delay if I should change airlines because I had an important business meeting. No. So I believed him and had no outbound flights available. Ruined so many plans and wasted so much money. 2 hour luggage line each way. Only fly this airline if you don’t care when you get there. This costs way more in time and aggravation than you can save.

### "Allegiant is a scam"
Stockton to Mesa. Allegiant is a scam! My fiancé had 2 flight (round trip) scheduled and paid in full for an out of state job interview. I have to accommodate on a conflicting schedule and had to arrive a little earlier and couldn’t make the first flight. I had plan to fly back on the return flight. Unbeknownst to us, Allegiant decided to cancel the entire flight including the return flight as well? What kind of service is this? I agreed, the flex trip wasn’t paid for so the 1st flight should be cancel without a refund. No problem, but for them to also cancel the return flight that we had paid for separately is just plain straight scam! This airline is the worst and comes up with tactic and loop hole like this to scam people. So if you plan on doing a round trip without a flex trip fee paid, it’s best if you just pay one way each so if Allegiant cancel the flight you missed, then they won’t be able to cancel the other one as well. Such an incompetent airline and this is how they scam people. A con artist airline that is out there with tons of small loop holes to scam customers. It was on the last day and we were put on hold for more than an hour. Didn’t want to argue with the lady on the phone so the lady said she will only charge us an additional $75 and she will be able to get me back on the return flight. So in addition to having to pay for the return flight I’m being charged an extra $75 because apparently it’s in their policy that if we missed the first flight, then the entire flight that was scheduled will be cancelled. So I question if the flight was to be scheduled separately then, they can’t automatically cancelled the entire flight?

### "Cancelled return flight"
Salt Lake City to Phoenix. Worst flight ever. Cancelled return flight at last minute. tried to reschedule and no flights available for 5 days. Cost me around $1000 to get back home to a different airport. I cannot believe they only refunded me $52 a ticket. How is this dishonest operation still in business? Could not get ahold of anyone on customer service. On hold for hours and emailed with no reply!

### "they would pull up their socks"
Bellingham to Las Vegas. I understand this is a cheap airline, but customer appreciation should still be afforded. We were delayed almost 3 hours at departure. Never once was an apology given. Finally when two Allegiant planes arrived we boarded and the other on schedule flight boarded. We sat there for a long time wondering again what the reason for the delay was. Meanwhile the on time plane next to us had left. Still not one Sorry about that. We have flown Allegiant dozens of times and after the bad publicity would think they would pull up their socks. Both to and fro flights had a number of empty seats. Now I can see why, especially when in the past the planes were full.

### "thankful and appreciative"
Not Verified |  Sanford to South Bend with Allegiant Air. The flight attendant was very accommodating and helpful in getting me a more comfortable seat. I am 6’8, have an artificial knee, and was originally placed in the back. However, the attendant was nice enough to give me a whole aisle. I am very thankful and appreciative for their willingness to work with me on my leg room issue.

### "the very best experience"
Flint to Clearwater. This was the very best experience we've had flying. We fly every year, and normally use Delta or Spirit. We decided to Allegiant a try, and we will only use them from now on. Getting through TSA and boarding the plane was a breeze! Very friendly, fast service. The seats were decent, we paid to sit in the exit row. They offered the typical drinks, snacks and alcoholic beverages for purchase. Was a smooth flight and no delays at all. The prices were unbeatable, too!! We paid nearly half what we usually pay other airlines. I highly recommend this airline.

### "The staff was pleasant"
Not Verified |  Toledo to St. Pete–Clearwater. Amazing airline! My granddaughter and I just took a quick trip to Florida and back. The staff was pleasant, the seats were in perfect condition. Both ways were on time. I have nothing but good things to say about this airline. Price was also very good. Thanks for letting me give a shout out to them.

### "Read the fine print"
Salt Lake City to Phoenix. Read the fine print. We had an emergency with our housing situation and tried to cancel our flight. It costed more to cancel then it costed for the flight in general. It’s $75 per trip per person bringing our cancelation fees to $150 per person being that it was a round trip flight. For 2 people. Which means the total cancelation fees were $300 for my husband and I. We rented a car on top of that as well. They wouldn’t refund our money instead they offered a voucher to fly with them again (which why in the world would we want to do that?) and the voucher would only be for $122. We paid $498 total and can’t get not one dime back. First time booking flights with them and last time ever. Horrible horrible service and like mentioned in other reviews, you do get what you pay for.

### "This airline is horrible"
Not Verified |  This airline is horrible! I had a family member die while on vacation in Florida. I tried to change my flight up one day just to make it on time for the military service for this family member. They had five extra seats available and refused to change my flight without charging me a change fee and for the extra flight which I could not afford. Leaving vacation a day early is completely not what I want to do, basically told me I was lying after sending them an obituary and everything. After I sent an obituary that they asked for as proof they wanted a “note from the funeral home”. They made a horrible situation even worse for me and my family I was so sick after 5 phone calls and I’m tears. Would never recommend this airline and will never fly again.

### "Expect delays and cancellations"
Expect delays and cancellations! We've had terrible experiences with Allegiant Air and will never fly with them again. It's a cheap airline and travelers do get what they pay for, which is a lot of inconvenience. We've flown 4 round trips with Allegiant and all eight legs of our journeys were marred by delays and cancellations. Allegiant always has ready-made, convenient "reasons" for the delays and cancellations (like mysterious "mechanical issues") but it boils down to the fact that they don't fly any plane that isn't booked to full capacity. If there are any empty seats on your flight, chances are your plane is going to be delayed or cancelled altogether. I can't believe it took me four round trips to come to the realization that this is their pattern. In June 2016 they delayed our flight 4 times over the course of 8 hours and then cancelled the flight just prior to boarding because the crew had "timed out" of their work hours for the 24 hour period. Yes, the crew "timed out" because they kept delaying our flight for unknown reasons! We've lost entire days of our vacation and hotel costs because of Allegiant. Also, their customer service is horrible. I've waited over two hours on hold (speakerphone) before I finally gave up. They don't answer their phones or respond to online inquiries or emails. I will pay more to get to my destination on time. Buyer beware!

### "Staff were very unapologetic"
Not Verified |  Had a terrible experience traveling with Allegiant Air. The flights themselves weren't bad but the delays and how we were treated while waiting was the worst of it. On our way to our destination we were delayed about 12 hours, in 30 min/1 hr/2 hr increments overnight - from 8 pm until 8 am the next morning. I was 21 weeks pregnant at the time and sick with a terrible cold and would have gladly even paid for myself to go sleep in a hotel (though they should be paying for it or offering some kind of reimbursement) had they just told us our flight wasn't leaving until the next morning but instead they kept coming up with excuses and making us think we were leaving soon and then pushing it up even further. One of the worst nights of my life at the airport. Flights were not delayed due to weather or "unpredictable" circumstnaces but due to staffing and airplane scheduling and maintenance issues. Staff were very unapologetic and not kind whatsoever. On the return flight we didnt think anything would be delayed because it couldn't possibly happen twice but again the flight was delayed 4 hours (not so bad this time) but also was delayed in short increments, when likely they could just tell everyone the truth from the get go. Our flights with Allegiant were $350 for two passengers round trip, so cheap, but i would have gladly paid twice the money not to deal with them again.

### "very bad experience"
Medford to Los Angeles. First time and last time flying with Allegiant. The flight was delayed 3 hours. They charge me 50$ for my small carry on, plus they did not let me take it with me on the plane! They told me it would have to fit under my seat. When I arrived to the plane there was plenty of empty spaces in the above head compartments. When I asked the flight attendant about the incoherence of my carry on, the only answer was “I do not know”. They said we were going to get a 50$ voucher that I will never use because I will not fly again with them. I do not recommend this airline, very bad experience.

### "had terrible experiences"
Toledo to Orlando. We've had terrible experiences with Allegiant Air and will never fly with them again. It's a cheap airline and travelers do get what they pay for, which is a lot of inconvenience. We've flown 4 round trips with Allegiant and all eight legs of our journeys were marred by delays and cancellations. Allegiant always has ready-made, convenient "reasons" for the delays and cancellations but it boils down to the fact that they don't fly any plane that isn't booked to full capacity.

I will pay more to get to my destination on time. Buyer beware!

### "Both flights were delayed"
Indianapolis to Jacksonville. Both flights were delayed. Not slightly but by hours. Not weather related. I fly frequently with standard airlines. Tried this airline once and only once.

### "so happy and grateful"
I left my wallet on the plane without realizing it. When I returned to the airport the next day, a very kind Allegiant employee took the time to walk me over to the Lost and Found. It was closed, however, she used her ID badge to go in herself (not her assigned duty that day) and found and returned it to me after I confirmed my ID. The $100 cash was still in my wallet, although I was happiest that I would not have to replace all my cards! I asked this employee if she would accept cash as a thank you and she declined. She was just very happy for me. It’s how someone responds when the chips are down that you see a person’s or a company’s true colors. I was so happy and grateful not just for this employee but also for the employees who found my wallet initially and delivered it to Lost and Found. Thank you Allegiant Air employees!

### "budget bare bones airline"
Indianapolis to Sarasota. My husband and I have both flown Allegiant in the past. We know that it’s a definitely a budget bare bones airline. However they recently started a route that flies directly to his parents hometown so we thought how do we pass that up? I’m a nurse so the best way I can write this review and explain would be in military time. Day one 0800 - get an alert on our phone that our 0900 flight will be delayed about an hour. We were instructed to wait in the gate area. Announced that for weather reasons the flight may take off at 1000, they will keep up posted. Boarded flight and take off around 1030 to Sarasota destination. 1200 get an announcement on the plane that we are about 50min our from our destination and are beginning our descent. 1230, updated that a plane ahead of us encountered bad weather and we are being rerouted to Destin, Florida so we can refuel and then take off once the storm has passed. Water and Chex mix were passed out. Taxied around Destin on the plane until about 1340 and then are given the option to get off the plane at Destin. Three other Allegiant flights had also been detoured. The tiny Destin airport was completely overwhelmed with an hour long Quiznos line and a handful of outlets that were being guarded for dear life. 1530 got an announcement all flights to Sarasota should reboard. Boarded, watched the seatbelt demonstration etc and were taxing for about 45min assuming that we were just waiting our turn to take off. 1630 announced that our plane didn’t pass one of the maintenance checks and that they needed to have some people come out and work on the plane. 1700 from the captain “well the bad news just keeps on coming” now our crew was reaching their maximum work time and they would need to find a new crew. 1710 - deboarded for a second time. Announced overhead the flight would be leaving around 1800. 1755 - announced our flight was canceled and would be rescheduled for the following day at 0700. All chaos then ensued. In the announcement it was said to see the ticket counter for our voucher for a hotel and meal. One long line of our entire flight (200 people) wrapped around the ticket area and multiple times we were instructed to split off into different lines that ended up making zero sense. Two times we followed the instructions given by Allegiant staff that ended up having us in a completely different area while the main line continued to move. People were absolutely heated and little to no information was being distributed. Where were these hotels? How would we get there? Destin is a small city with only a handful of Ubers. We were asked by one Allegiant staff member in a loud tone “if we even knew how a line worked.” Probably not the tone you want to use with a bunch of confused customers who have been standing in lines and waiting going on 12 hours. Then without warning the line structure went out the window and the Allegiant staff started yelling out passenger names with the paper voucher in their hands. Three employees were yelling names over each other and sometimes just using first names, not very helpful. To the lucky that got their names called they got a second piece of paper with five hotel options we could call and book to see if they had availability for us, a few hotels didn’t even know if they accepted the Allegiant voucher so that was not encouraging. Unfortunately we never got our names called so we waited in the ticket counter line for over an hour and got our voucher around 1945.

### "Left gate late as usual"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Asheville. Left gate late as usual - 30 minutes, when landed we sat on the tarmac for 50 minutes. Poor planning on Allegiant part especially into a very small airport. Do not recommend this company. Charge cheap rates until you pay $50 for a 40lb bag and charged for soft drinks.

### "at the gate 2 minutes late"
Orlando to Grand Rapids. There were 5 different passengers (not traveling together) who were at the gate 2 minutes late. They would not let us on. The door to the jetway was still open and they had 13 minutes before departure. We were all 1-2 minutes late, ran from security, the security line was unusually long. Then, we were selected for secondary screening. I’ve never been turned away from a flight while there are still people on the jetway. Very unaccommodating. Very unprofessional. Will not be flying Allegiant again. They just made $75 pp to have us re-book. What a scam.

### "not be getting on this flight"
I left St. Petersburg/Clearwater I traveled with them before so I knew we get one personal item so I use the same bag each time when traveling. My flight there went as usual as planned. On April 15th I was due to return home with the same bag. After going thru TSA, I went and took a seat to wait to for my flight as I was waiting I see a Allegiant Rep/ Mid-America Airport worker coming to passengers on the flight asking them if they have a personal item or carry on mind you I have my bag sitting next to me she never once said anything to me she tagged people’s bag who she said she felt wasn’t a personal item - she looked and me sitting there and my bag and still said nothing to me. Well about an hour later they start calling my flight, as I was walking up toaboard the flight the same woman said “that’s too big for a personal item” very rudely and stern. I said  I flew here with this and never had a problem before with prior travel, she said your not getting on my plane with the bag unless you pay for it. She took my bag and put it in the slot to see if it fit in the personal items (which it did) she says it’s still to big so at this point I’m frustrated and want to get home so I go to another representative and tell her to look my reservation up and she said she found my reservation so I offered to pay for my bag and I would take it up with Allegiant when I got home. She said well your bag is free I’m not going to charge you because you will not be getting on this flight.

### "Never again Allegiant"
Punta Gorda to Raleigh. Never Again. One way ticket to RDU. Purchased on a Monday, flight on Friday (only flight of the day at 6am), 95 bucks, good deal! First time flyer with Allegiant Air. Arrive in lobby, no self check in kiosks. Go to counter to confirm reservation email / confirmation code. Speak with nice lady, she says “Yes, I have you here, you’ve completed your self check in online, however you will require a boarding pass.” She further explains that the Allegiant app would be able to provide that in the future. Ready? Hard copy of the eticket boarding pass? 5 bucks. Make it through TSA, awaiting zone to be called when I hear announcement in gate area “Those of you carrying any carry on’s will be checked on your ticket to confirm you are allowed to carry a bag on our airline.” A standard size carry on to be placed in the overhead bin the day of travel at the airport of your departure, 50 bucks, but wait, there’s more! So a standard size carry on 14 x 9 x 22. A checked bag the day of travel at the airport of your departure, 50 bucks, not weighing more than 40 lbs and a maximum size of 80 linear inches (H + W + D). A 40 lb bag vs a light 15 pound bag, literally dropping off before the TSA screening vs carrying onto the plane is the same cost. Well as I’m one of the last several people to board the plane, spot several empty seats. As to not be a jerk to the 2 people that are seated and to make them get up and move, so I can grab a window seat, I say “That’s alright, no worries, I’ll just hop in a seat over here.” No, I’m told not until we are in the air, only when the seatbelt sign has been turned off by a stern flight attendant.” Lady from NY that is seated next to me says, we would have chosen different seats elsewhere, but it would’ve been an extra 40 bucks (20 each) to choose. At this point I’m doing the math in my head and am just glad the plane is leaving on time and we’re in the air. So I go to the iPad and begin to watch some mindless Netflix. 45 minutes later, our snack / drink service comes around. Dehydrated from the early coffee and altitude, I ask for cup of ice water. We have bottles for 2.00.” Oh, well then how about a ginger ale on ice? Yes sir, that will also be 2.00” Ah, I see, no thanks, what about a bag of pretzels or nuts then? Yes sir, 4.00”. I just laughed at that point and said, I’ll just wait until we land. Talk about a nickel and dime airline. Unbelievable. Worst experience I’ve ever encountered. The worst part as a consumer, make your policies known in large font on your home page before people decide to purchase “A good deal airfare ticket.” Wait, better not, your customer purchases would probably rapidly drop and your company would lose millions. What a racket. Never again Allegiant. Never again.

### "attendants condescending and cold"
Not Verified |  Flint to Punta Gorda. This was my first time traveling Allegiant. I found several of their representatives, check in and flight attendants condescending and cold. I have a disability and needed assistance. One asked me several times if I was traveling with someone as it was not their job to provide me with assistance. Another gave me information that I knew was incorrect. The Punta Gorda airport boarding ramp is on the tarmac and steeply ramped to the plane door. I had to be placed in a wheelchair to board and deplane as my scooter could not handle the ramp. Those folks tried their best to accommodate me. I was not aware that there was a charge for all snacks and beverages. When asked what was complimentary, the response was Ice, did I want a glass? Overall, I think more emphasis needs to be given to customer service.

### "stood in line for at least an hour"
Fort Lauderdale to Cincinnati. Let me just say its ridiculous that we cannot check in our luggage more than 2 hours ahead! They could have checked us in, let us go through customs and wait on other end of airport where there is plenty of restaurants and shopping. Seriously we stood in line for at least an hour before we could even get to the agent. Only to be turned away and told come 2 hours before.

### "poor customer service"
This was my first time flying with Allegiant, as I usually fly with Southwest. I thought I would try this airline to return home from an unexpected short vacation to FL. My seat was 3D (a seat I had paid for), and I had a carry on bag. I attempted to put my bag in the overhead bin, but it was closed, and I was quickly corrected that those were reserved for rows 1 and 2 passengers and their items. The bins for the next several rows were full of other passenger's items, so I placed my carry on about 5 rows back in that bin. I was thinking how inconvenient this would be when I went to get off the plane, as I would have to backtrack to get my personal items. As rows 1 and 2 filled, the flight attendant opened those 2 overhead bins, and after there was no more traffic from passengers boarding the plane, I realized there was still plenty of space to put my small carry on bag right above my seat. As I got up and went several rows back to grab my bag and move it, the flight attendant quickly corrected me and told me they were still waiting on 1 more passenger and they may need that space. She was rude and loud. I told her if another passenger boarded and there was not room for my belongings, that I would move them again. She replied with another rude comment, rolled her eyes, and kept to herself. Another passenger never boarded. There would have been space for my belongings the entire time, as there should have been, because again, I paid for this seat, and I have just as much right as any other passenger to store my personal belongings near me. The FA was so rude that even the other passengers around me noticed, and were caught off guard by her attitude. When exiting the plane after landing in Louisville, I grabbed my carry on (which was now above me in the overhead bin due to me moving it), and watched as the FA said "Thank you for flying with Allegiant, have a good day! to passengers exiting before me; when I exited, she didn't look at me, nor wish me a good day. Overall poor customer service.

### "not adjustable and very uncomfortable"
Not Verified |  I have now flown with Allegiant Air 4 times total and it is always the same little flight from Provo to Mesa and back again. For an hour flight it is ok to fly. The seats are not adjustable and very uncomfortable. The tray table on my last two flights is only as big as a cell phone. Why would they downgrade a tray table in a plane? For any flight longer than an hour I would never fly them. The only reason I do use them is because they are the only airline out of the airport closest to me.

### "By far the worst airline"
Indianapolis to Cancun. By far the worst airline we have ever used. Delays both there and back. One was a mechanical issue and they claimed the other was due to snow. Friends reported no snow/ice delay issue with another airline they used, and we saw no snow or ice when landing. In total we had almost 7 hours of delays. We had to take buses to the airplane to board from steps on the tarmac after our gate of departure was changed due to the airplane's late arrival The flight attendants were unfriendly on both flights. One of the flight attendants was asleep during part of the flight returning to Indianapolis. Another couple told us that the same attendant would not assist them in throwing away items when requested. All seats were of the same class, but the first few rows received a package of misc. snacks and the rest of the plane received none. Our friends were in one of the rows (5th) that did receive the package. They did pay the same price for their flight with no request or upgrade made. I would not recommend this airline to anyone and will not be using Allegiant in the future.

### "rude and uncooperative"
Clearwater to Norfolk. The staff at the Norfolk airport for Allegiant Air was absolutely wonderful. Being it was my first time flying with this airline I was very pleased. Sad to say that my returning flight wasn't as nice. The baggage check was rude and uncooperative. I had to pay 5 dollars for a boarding pass and she separated me and my wife even after asking to keep us together. Given the fact that the couple before us got asked where did they want to sit and that it's up to their discretion to let people sit together if the plane isn't full. I had to pay for one of my bags and that was fifty dollars. But because my bag was five pounds over they was trying to charge me fifty more dollars. Then I found out that the scales was off because she said I was fine then after taking it off the scales to close it she put it back on the scales the weight was off. Then when trying to board the plane the lady told me I could have my carry-on bag because I am military but when I get to the lady at the door she wouldn't let me on. I told her I was military and she was extremely rude and told me to get out of line. Then I see another after I tried to talk to her again she just dismissed me like I wasn't even there. So when I see another milyguy get on the plane with a roll on I brought it to her attention and she told me because he was military with hostility like I was getting on her nerves. Once again I stated and other people started stating the same thing is when she finally let me on stating I never showed her my ID. When she never gave me a chance to. It's sad to say that I don't see myself or my family using this airline again.

### "The worst airline ever"
Albany to Punta Gorda. The worst airline ever. Charged me $5 for a boarding pass. 4 hours delayed and counting. No one is sure of anything who works here. Do not fly with this airline. Spend a few extra dollars, fly southwest! Unless you want to vacation at the airport.

### "Staff was pleasant"
Not Verified |  Fort Wayne to Mesa. This was the first time I'd flown with Allegiant and was very happy with both outgoing and inbound flights. Staff was pleasant and approachable. Do not have a negative thing to say about it.

### "cheaper than others"
Not Verified |  Peoria to Punta Gorda. Our plane was new and clean. The staff was very friendly. Our flight actually left 15 minutes early. This airline charges extra for luggage, but still was cheaper than others. You don’t have to pay extra for your seat and can do this at check in for free.

### "Very bad first experience"
Idaho Falls to Phoenix. First of all, my flight was delayed. Second, my window seat I paid extra for was taken and flight attendant asked me to sit in an open middle seat. I waited over an hour after getting off plane for bags to come. When they did arrive, my new suitcase had a large dent in the top corner. Very bad first experience with allegiant.

### "worst customer service"
Fort Lauderdale to Indianapolis. Absolute worst customer service I’ve ever seen! Not sure they even understand the meaning. I waited in a line of 100+ people for nearly an hour and a half. Then when I got up to the front I was told to get out of the line because it was exactly 2 hrs from my flight. Everything was paid for, we already had our boarding passes, literally just needed to hand them our bag and go to our gate. The attendant still told us we had to wait another hour. I’m tried to explain that we’ve been in line over a hour and a half and in that time, the line had only gotten longer and more disorganized. The attendant still told us to go to the back of the line. We booked these flights because they were a bit cheaper, but honestly if I knew what I do now, I would happily paid the extra money for an airline that has their stuff in order. This experience has been horrible - they (as a team) give absolutely zero about how they’re making their (paying) customers feel.

### "Worst customer service ever"
My trip with Allegiant Air was the worst trip of my life. I rate this airline 1 out of 5. My flight for Wednesday was cancelled. When I talked with them at the airport they said that I had to call customer service. They cannot do anything. Customer service put me on hold for 4 hours to reschedule my flight. Worst customer service ever. When I talked with them, they say that they can put me on flight which is three days later (Saturday). So, they put me on flight for tomorrow to a different destination (Fargo, North Dakota) which is a four hour drive away from my destination (Sioux Falls). I had to make travel arrangements to my destination on my own. Further, they didn't even provide me any compensation for my accommodation and food. I had to stay in hotel in Vegas and pay for food on my own on Wednesday. I reached Fargo the next day around 8 pm. I couldn't get a flight at that time. So, I had stay in a hotel that day also. So, I reached my destination the following day. In short, I was supposed to reach to my destination on Wednesday. But thanks to Allegiant Air, I arrived home on Friday. I was on the way for three days.

### "never use Allegiant again"
Made reservation from Syracuse NY to St Petersburg/Clearwater International on Feb 19th, to fly out on Feb 22nd for a family emergency with a car rental. The car rental did not register correctly. Needed to call Allegiant customer service. On hold over a hour to make update. Arrived in St Petersburg/Clearwater and picked up Alamo car rental. The next day I went back to Alamo to see if I would have a problem returning the vehicle and the representative said no and that I would only be charged for the one day I had the car rental. The Alamo representative asked me for my credit card and that I would only be charged for 1 day. I kept checking my credit card and did not see a credit so I called Alamo on March 14th and was told that I needed to call Allegiant. I called Allegiant customer service and was on hold for over 1 and 1/2 hour to be told that any package deal was refundable. I told Allegiant representative I was told by the Alamo representative I would have not problem returning the vehicle and was only going to be charged for 1 day and the representative said that the Alamo representatives do not know the contract that is between Allegiant and Alamo. Do not get a car rental or a hotel together with Allegiant. I would have never returned the vehicle I the representative would have told me I would not be refunded any money. I also paid over $141 in taxes and fees to Alamo for the one day having the rental on top of paying for an entire weeks rental that I would not have returned if I had been told that I would have not been refunded the money from the unused time. I will never use Allegiant again nor will any of my family members or friends.

### "definitely use them again"
Cincinnati to Las Vegas. This was my second trip using Allegiant Air. Both trips were very good. On my latest trip, all Allegiant staff that I encountered were professional and friendly. I had the same captain on both flights and he was very friendly and even walked through the cabin to introduce himself to the passengers. Both flights were in time even though we had a gate change on the return flight. The seats were not comfortable, but for the price and experience, I will definitely use them again.

### "Save yourself the trouble"
I flew with my 5 month old son. I checked his car seat at the gate in Niagara Falls. When I arrived in Florida, there was loose pieces of someone else’s car seat in my seat. The base of my seat was broken into 3 pieces and the large piece was never found. I have given them proof and purchase price and date. $400.00 and it was 5 months old. They are offering me $80.00. That won’t even cover half of a new base. When I landed in Florida it took 1.5 hours to even get someone to actually help me and not just pass me off to someone else. Save yourself the trouble if you have children.

### "never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Fort Lauderdale to Asheville. I will never fly with them again. Their customer service is horrible in Fort Lauderdale. They made us wait to check our bags until an hour before the flight. You literally get what you pay for. The air conditioning broke on the plane and our flight was delayed twice.

### "experience was absolutely wonderful"
It was my first time flying ever. I had no idea what to expect. I had done my own research on Allegiant and have seen a lot of bad things and not a lot of good. My experience was absolutely wonderful. Flights both ways were on time, staff were all very kind, and even though the plane was full both ways it wasn’t overwhelming. Plus the price to fly was 70 dollars both ways that’s amazing. Will definitely fly with Allegiant again in the future.

### "Customer service was zero"
Not Verified | Booked our direct flight from Indianapolis to Orlando for a short vacation. Read the reviews and thought a delay would be the worst we would encounter since there were no layovers. Day prior to flying out, I received a call that our flight has already been delayed an entire 6 hours! That took away one full day by the time we arrived. Couldn’t imagine that it would get worse but of course it did. Arrive for our return flight and all appears on track to leave at the correct time. Then the delays started rolling in. First delay was for 30 minutes. Second delay pushed it back another hour. This continues until we are 4 hours past our departure time. Still all good long as we make it back (my girlfriend had an important meeting the following evening). Then the cancellation happened. Huge problem a stranding 100+ people with no option out until the following night at 6pm (30 hours after our selected departure time)! Immediately called customer service (as the line for the onsite crew ran into the food court). Customer service was zero help aside from reimbursing us for that leg of the trip. Found out from customs service the initial reason for the cancellation was due to weather. How is that possible when I’m looking at the weather in both locations and it looks impossible to be due to weather conditions. Upon mentioning that, customer service then stated it wasn’t actually due to weather but mechanical issues (found out later that this has been a huge problem with many Allegiant planes). No help finding flights out. No help finding hotel accommodations. No help in any way. I totally understand there is a limit to the help someone can provide over the phone but it came across like I knew more about the flight statuses and options going near our return location than customer support searching through their system. As all flights canceled one by one that were going to our home state, we resigned to the fact we’re going to need a place to stay or book another flight from Orlando. They literally expected everyone to crash in the airport or scramble to book a last minute flight for that evening or the following day. With a limited number of options to get back in time, we booked the last two seats on a flight that cost a whopping $2,200 total. Made it home 10 hours later than expected and exhausted from all the travel hassle. Lesson learned here. Never flying Allegiant Air again.

### "The worst experience"
Not Verified |  The worst experience. I will Never fly again with this airline from the beginning customer service was aweful there are too many hidden charges thAt are not told to you in the beginning and the staff was the worst in informing you when you asked questions. I was charged $100 for a carry on $50 each way I asked the rep first off why didn’t the lady in the front inform me of a charge when I got my boarding pass which cost me $5.00. Then to begin boarding the plane I’m informed my bag is $50 then told we are charging you a $100 what the hell. Misleading a fair that was $130 turned to $265 it’s not the money it’s the misrepresentation and then only being told it’s on the website No one books a ticket reading a websites total disgrace to the airline industry.

### "Thanks for a job well done"
Punta Gorda to Omaha. The Allegiant staff at Punta Gorda were amazing, very polite and professional. Didn’t meet a rude person at all. The flight attendants went above and beyond! and added humor to our flight. Flights were on time and smooth. I would fly Allegiant with this group again anytime. Thanks for a job well done.

### "couldn't check my luggage in"
Not Verified |  Since when did handling luggage become complicated? Arrived two and a half hours early for flight and was told I couldn't check my luggage in now as they were still handling an earlier flight. This does not accommodate the TSA wait lines especially when you only have one person working the counter. We have been flying for over a century folks and have embraced technology, so what has put Allegiant at Syracuse airport behind the times.

### "In a word disgraceful"
Fort Walton to Newark. Allegiant Air canceled my return flight by text at 8:48 pm last night. Was scheduled to leave Fort Walton FL. at 7:30 am today 2-23-19 to Newark. Weather is perfect at both airports, my father was rushed to hospital yesterday after falling and hitting his head and I’m stuck here till tomorrow at a cost of approximately $1300 for the extra day and Allegiant is not responsible for any of incurred expenses. In a word disgraceful.

### "One of the worst experiences"
Sioux Falls to Sanford. One of the worst experiences of my life! So they have been booking flights that get in so late that all the rental car places are closed. So I couldn't go on the trip because of this and they wouldn't credit my money back. Pretty shady if you ask me! They should know that the rental car places may be closed and post that when booking tickets. Had I known that I wouldn't have booked the flight at all. I'm out $385 now cause of it. Also they do charge extra for everything too. Even carry on bags are extra. Nothing is noted about this either. I had to add them for an additional $80 then right after that that's when I went to add a rental car and little did I know not only their affiliate car rental places were closed by the time the flight got in but all the rental car places were closed so the tickets were completely useless cause of that. There's not even a hotel around that airport either so yeah after hours of being on the phone with countless reps and disputing the charges with my credit card company I'm still stuck with the charges cause of the non refundable BS they have even though I cancelled with plenty of time for them to resell the seats. They didn't even try to though cause I kept getting email updates on the flight that I cancelled. I highly suggest pay a little more and use a better airline that doesn't charge extra for things that should be included and they would actually help you out if you need a rental car and that isn't shady about it.

### "one of the worst airlines"
Rockford to Punta Gorda with Allegiant Air. This is one of the worst airlines on the planet. Bought a round trip ticket for my daughter and they canceled her flight a couple of hours before it was schedule to take off. Went on their app to cancel the coming home flight and it ended up cancelling the whole trip. Now we are stuck with my daughter who doesn't have a flight back to school. Called customer support and this was another disaster. On hold for about an hour and finally got the rudest customer service agent which couldn't do anything to help. She said there was nothing we could do to get her flight back and if I wanted to get the same flight I had to pay double the price of the original ticket. I ended up getting another flight from Spirit. They didn't refund the whole amount for my tickets and short $26. I tried to call back and can't get through. Never again using them.

### "Staff uncommunicative"
Provo to Los Angeles. Staff uncommunicative and didn’t even send us through TSA in time for the boarding time posted on our tickets (we have ten minutes until we board and no passengers have been allowed through TSA yet). Completely unorganized and an unpleasant experience overall.

### "Do not fly this airline!"
El Paso to Las Vegas. Do not fly this airline! We got to their ticket counter, within an hour of our flight, to check in and no one was there. The airport called over the intercom three times for an Allegiant rep to come down to help us. Finally, a rep comes down within 5 mins of our flight taking off and says she wouldn't open the ticket counter back up because the flight was already 80% full. Then, we called customer service for a refund. They would not give us a refund but would give us a credit with an $80 fee attached. Seriously, the worst airline service I've ever experienced. The absolute indifference the Allegiant rep showed to us was incredibly telling of how this airline treats their customers. Especially their military customers! I am stationed a few states away from my family and do not see them often. This was supposed to be a family trip and for everyone to see my 11 month old daughter (that most of my family hasn't met yet) however, now isn't happening because the ticket agent wouldn't open up the ticket counter "because they are 80% full. This airline might be affordable but you are getting what you pay for.

### "They charge for everything"
Idaho Falls to Phoenix. Horrible service. They charge for everything, including a charge for not paying beforehand. Never flying with them again. They may seem like they offer better rates but they don’t.

### "Highly recommend"
Staff was amazing! We flew from Appleton to Mesa and it was our 1.5yr olds 1st flight. I was beyond nervous, but from gate checking our stroller to playing peek a boo to helping get our bags out from our above compartment the flight crew was awesome! Highly recommend this airline! !

### "make sure you read the fine print"
Knoxville to St. Petersburg. Just an FYI to anyone checking a bag - make sure you read the fine print and understand that this cheap company has you paying $50, $25 online per 40lbs, unlike every other airline who lets you have 50lbs. Fun little trick/scam that they have so that you’re forced to spend an extra $50 on top of what you already paid at the counter - so now I’m paying more ($150) rountrip to get my bag in the air than myself. Pretty ridiculous. But bravo to the genius who came up with that one on Allegiants part!

### "Worst flight encountered."
Albany to Punta Gorda. Worst flight I have ever encountered. Flight was suppose to leave at 1038am I am still sitting on the aircraft at 448pm. Took us hours to get a lousy $8.00 and also a $50.00 credit that I will never use because I will never fly this airline again.

### "Terrible baggage policies"
Not Verified |  Cincinnati to Phoenix. Do not check baggage unless you are on your return trip! I was on a direct flight on a Friday afternoon and my luggage was lost. It went to Savanna instead of Phoenix. I completed a lost luggage claim. The baggage handlers in Savanna knew they had a errant piece of luggage but did nothing to attempt to get it to the correct location. Allegiant’s policy states they will contact the passenger in 24 hours to inform them of the location of the luggage but by Monday afternoon I had still not heard from them. I finally received word that I would receive my luggage in Arizona Wednesday night, but I return to Cincinnati Wednesday morning! Now I will not get my luggage until February 4th-10 days after my departure! Terrible baggage policies and extremely poor customer service.

### "changed our flight time"
Not Verified |  Allegiant notified us nine days before flying that they had changed our flight time to six hours later in the day, effectively cutting a half-day off of our vacation. No explanation was given other than it was a "market decision". This caused issues with our booked accommodations and in meeting up with another couple. The solutions offered involved either driving 2/2.5 hours to fly out of another city (and the accompanying cost of a rental car and overnight hotel), fly four days earlier (sooner than our accommodations reservation) or, cancel our reservation which was made in early December and try and re-book on another airline. None of these were acceptable so we were forced to cancel and re-book at a cost $220 higher than our Allegiant tickets. We had flown Allegiant before without a problem, but, this ridiculous situation will likely mean we would no longer even consider flying Allegiant. We last flew Allegiant in either 2016 or 2017.

### "you get what you pay for"
Indianapolis to St. Petersburg. Overall very low budget airline and you get what you pay for with this company. Understand you are getting a very cheap flight to your destination with no frills or thrills and limited functionality from other airlines. No WiFi and they nickel and dime you to death. They will stop you and charge fees for the carryon almost habitually. Again you get what you pay for with this airline. It’s cheap they will get you there but everything else about it is pretty terrible from a customer stand point.

### "not given us a full refund"
Concord Regional to St Petersburg. After waiting two hours on a plane that never showed up, we were informed that our flight was cancelled and would not be rescheduled. It's been over two weeks and Allegiant still has not given us a full refund. Keeping monies paid for a product/service you don't provide is unethical and illegal. After multiple calls and emails the problem still isn't resolved and they still have our money. If you are reading this and considering booking with this abysmal airline do yourself a favor STAY AWAY!

### "Excellent experience"
Excellent experience flying from Newburgh New York to Sanford Florida both ways. I didn’t expect frills from a budget airline and they were not any but the staff was friendly and helpful, both flights were on time and we didn’t have any problems.

### "everything was perfect"
I was apprehensive after reading over other reviews, but I'm so glad I took a chance on Allegiant!! From check-in to luggage retrieval, everything was perfect. The staff at the check-in counters at both airports were friendly and efficient. I think I spent two minutes, maximum, at each counter dropping off my bag, but I didn't feel rushed. Both flights left and arrived on time, and my luggage was available quickly. I felt like the website was very clear on the prices, and the airline sent multiple reminders to pay my baggage fees prior to arriving at the airport. I sat in an exit row on both flights, and checked a bag, and still paid significantly less than I would have flying any other airline, and I didn't have to go through Portland or Seattle, as I typically do to fly to Medford. I'm very happy with everything about this trip.

### "won't be flying them again!"
Not Verified |  "Ma'am - I really don't care if you fly Allegiant" - Punta Gorda gate agent Jan 2, 2019. The gate agent for our flight (1596) today - Jan 2, 2019 was quite possibly the worst I have ever dealt with in my flying history. I've flown all over the world and our family flies every 4-6 weeks - mostly frequently between Rochester NY and Southwest Florida. Until this past year I refused to fly Allegiant due to their bad on-time and service record but heard through friends that it wasn't too bad and have since flown with them 8 times. Today - the gate agent in Punta Gorda went out of her way to be nasty. I realize that, for the most part, you get what you pay for. This is why I always pay for upgraded seats (meaning we sit forward in seating position - not to be confused with better, bigger seats - because they are not. Not a problem. I know that and do not expect bigger better seats - still I pay more). In all of the previous flights, prior to today, I have traveled with the same luggage that I carried on today. As we approached the gate agent rudely told us to get out of line and stand aside as we needed to pay for a carry on. I told her I had flown with the bag, never having paid before, her response was "Well Today YOU DO. We watched many others board with the same or larger bags, before my husband approached and said  "these people have the same size bag, why are they not paying? She then looked for a passenger with a bag, took his phone from him and tried showing it to us. It was awkward and extremely unprofessional. When the rest of the plane had boarded and she was finally ready to "deal" with us and another passenger, she turned to us and said the bags we were boarding with had to be paid for. I  tried to explain once again that we had boarded the flight to PGD without incident, as well as many other Allegiant flights with the same bag. She could not have been ruder as she turned back and said that all of the of the other gate agents are not paying attention which, then, makes her job that much harder. At this point, I turned to my husband and said if this is the way Allegiant is going to treat people, we won't fly with them in the future. Having overheard my comment to my husband, the gate agent then addresses me and says "Ma'am I really don't care! Thousands of people will. WOW - through this whole ordeal I was thinking...it takes just as much energy to be nice as it does to be nasty - Yet she chose to be as snarky and rude as she could possibly be. I paid for a checked baggage, paid for seats, paid for my pet to fly - obviously I would have paid for a carry on bag if I had realized the necessity. This flight did change my opinion of Allegiant Air, what if the pilot and crew on board had the same "Ma'am I really don't care attitude"? We won't be flying them again!

### "poor customer service"
Not Verified |  Allegiant cancelled our flight 3 hrs prior- no explanation just a text. No reason given, no options given. Website is not user friendly. 24 hr customer service line - can’t get through- after 1.5 hrs on hold was Hung up on. We did not know what to do so we Decided to head to the airport. We were placed On an alternative flight which at least put us In our own state- then had to rent a car and drive home 4 hours after only 2 hours of sleep. Poor customer service or lack thereof. Since we took an alternate flight they “cannot help us Further”. They didn’t help at all to Begin with! It was a very stressful situation. The only way I was able to reach someone about my concern was via private fb message On their fb page. But they do not tell anyone this is an option- The options for getting ahold of someone That they provide are useless. Avoid this airline at all costs or you may miss your destination. And you will get zero help resolving your issue. Not worth saving a few hundred bucks. The flight attendants were very nice- not their fault- it’s the company that has poor customer service policies.

### "cancel the flight hours before"
McAllen to Orlando. Booked a flight to Orlando, Florida with months in advance and the airline decided to cancel the flight hours before! Not even to reschedule for a later time or for the next day. Just cancelled. Why? due to weather” when there are no blizzards in either area or thunderstorms. Very disappointed with their customer service and lack of accommodation. Not only did we lose out on that, but the hotel reservations and 4 day theme park tickets and reservations to restaurants. Their response and a way of apologizing was “we’re sorry for the inconvenience, there's nothing else we can do for you”.

### "Allegiant has been such a hassle"
St Petersburg to Tampa. Flying Allegiant should be the last option unless you are just looking for a cheap flight. You're not allowed anything free to drink including water unless you pay on the flight (but I was told I can get a cup of ice and wait for it to melt). Seats don't recline. Takes at least 45 minutes to get anyone on the phone for customer service. Once I was at the gate for departure and they told me I hadn't been checked in, even though I had their desk. Very rigid rules. The baggage restrictions are similar to other airlines as far as the maximum inches (H+W+L).. however if you're carrying on the plane, they want you to fit your carry-on in this skinny metal stand and if it doesn't fit they will charge a $50 fee. I was surprised because I had a piece of luggage that fit the maximum inches but because it didn't fit inside this skinny stand they made me pay and wouldn't refund my carry-on fee I paid for. Truth is if my carry-on was completely empty there was no way it would have fit, or anyone else's. I was shocked at how skinny it has to be. Also as I got on the plane, I counted about 14 other bags that were my exact size luggage that weren't asked to fit in their carry-on checking metal stand. Allegiant has been such a hassle.

### "rude and unprofessional"
Cincinnati to Jacksonville. Haven’t taken off, would get off now if I could. This airline is rude and unprofessional. Never again. I love a good deal but this was not work it in the slightest.

### "disappointed with this company"
Raleigh Durham to Tampa. Very disappointed with this company as I usually use to fly myself and my family back and forth between NC and Florida. The terms state you can be charged if the flight is cancelled or changed within 7 days. I've spent the last 24 hours getting in contact with a representative to cancel and now I finally have they are trying to charge me 75 to cancel even when it's more than the 7 days from my flight.

### "she kept telling them to shut up"
Los Angeles to Cincinatti. I am a customer who flies quite frequently for work and personal life. I have two emotional support dogs that I have had for 10 years and I have flown with them on many airlines including Allegiant before with no trouble. I purchased a ticket in September to fly home and surprise my family in Cincinnati for Christmas. I received an email from Allegiant in November, 2 months after I bought my ticket, saying that the emotional support policy had changed. I downloaded the documents that they told me I had to have it cost me $220 to get health certificates for both my ESA dogs. I showed up at the airport with my letter a form they made my doctor fill out, my ESA forms that cost me 220 and I checked in at the ticket counter. she said everything was fine. I go up and wait for an hour and a half at the gate nobody says anything to me. I go to check in for the flight and the worst customer service employee ever says to me I have removed you from this flight we’re getting your bags removed from the plane you’re only allowed to have one ESA dog. I was shocked and I said what and she said you have been removed from the flight step aside. that was it so when I tried to get information she just kept saying you’re only allowed one is a dog and I said I flew Allegiant in June and we were allowed to have two. I’ve never had a problem and she said the policy change December 10. She spoke to me so horribly and I already suffer from crippling anxiety which is why I have the ESA dogs, I started to panic and hyperventilate and cry uncontrollably so bad that other customers were trying to help me and she was telling them to shut up that she didn’t have to talk to them. She was so cold never offered any assistance as to what I could do to fix it she just kept saying you’re off this flight. I asked her if I could pay for a second animal and put them in the carrier and she yelled at me where you going to get a carrier!? I told her I had one in my luggage and she said you’re off this flight. when other customers ask for a supervisor she said there was none. A lady that was on my flight Looked online and said your policy says you can have two dogs. She responded that’s for normal inflight people not people with disabilities and ESA dogs. Why would people just flying be allowed more courtesy and then people with disabilities flying? And why would a customer service agent go out of her way to not help someone or give them any options or any comfort in a terrible situation? Other customers were trying to offer to put my dog in their bag and she just kept telling all of them to shut up she didn’t have to talk to them. I’ve never experienced anything like it do not ever fly Allegiant ever it’s horrible. Why would people just flying be allowed more courtesy and then people with disabilities flying? And why would a customer service agent go out of her way to not help someone or give them any options or any comfort in a terrible situation?

I’ve never experienced anything like it do not ever fly Allegiant ever it’s horrible

### "last thing we need to hear"
Mesa to Belleville. First i would like to say the app and update notifications are great. Nothing about the airline is a problem up until you actually get there. Yes we are aware that its a smaller hub with cheaper flights (unless you check bags etc) so there are things you have to just understand and go with the flow about the process. However, whenever I get to the airport blatantly frantic and apologetic knowing I'm running late but have just enough time to make my flight, the last thing someone in my position wants to hear is "yep, you're not gonna make it. You might as well not even try. Your bags not gonna make it either. Go talk to the lay at the end" I was given attitude by the check in lady along with the lady once I made it to my gate (I would like it to be known i in fact did make my flight and got to my destination even after being held at the check in desk for an unnecessary amount of time). I'd like to point out to the employees that nobody chooses or wants to be late for a flight to see their family. You don't know what happened before getting to the airport that made them late. That being said, your attitude is the last thing we need to hear during that stressful time. The customer service experience alone makes it not with the potential savings in money for the flight.

### "Avoid this carrier at all costs"
Washington to Asheville. Cancelled my flight home for Christmas with less than 3hrs notice, no reason, and no options to reschedule or transfer. I was already on the train to the airport when I got the message. When I called the number I received to find out what happened, there was no answer. I was stuck at the airport frantically Googling on my phone to find another flight -- which, 5 days before Christmas, was expensive to say the least. I'm fortunate enough that I could cover the cost, but I'm sure the move ruined a lot of holidays. Avoid this carrier at all costs!

### "extremely unresponsive"
Fort Lauderdale to Asheville. I have been trying to cancel my trip for a week now. Support extremely unresponsive on both phone calls and emails. I will now start a chargeback on my credit card to get my trip cancelled. Absolutely terrible customer support.

### "slow customer service"
Not Verified | Fort Lauderdale to Indiana. Long line to check bags, slow customer service, not friendly, crazy pricing strategy that leaves you feeling angry. On flight personnel were professional although not particularly friendly.

### "everyone was soaked"
Not Verified |  St. Petersburg to Niagara Falls. Boarded in St. Petersburg in pouring rain, by the time we got on the plane everyone was soaked. They should have installed a canopy to keep passenger out of the pouring rain. It is very unpleasant to sit on aircraft for 3 hours with wet clothes.

### "were not given any refunds"
Sioux Falls to Mesa. My wife and I booked our hotel, car rental, and airfare in a bundle package from AllegiantAir. We flew down to AZ to close up my in-laws house (who both passed away this summer) and were planning to return on Allegiant, but our plans changed when we couldn't sell my in-laws vehicle and had to drive back to MN from AZ. We cancelled the return flight, hotel, and car rental two days early, but had to forfeit the entire cost and we were not given any refunds. We ended up paying for two nights at the hotel and two days of the car rental that went un-used. We also had to forfeit the airfare for the return trip - all told about $700 that was forfeited. I understand that we might take a hit on cancelling the return flight, but I don't understand why we also lost the hotel and car rental fees. I'm sure the hotel was able to re-book our room for the two nights. Buyer beware if you plan to book using the all-in-one "convenience" with Allegiant Air, and don't pay the extra $75 insurance fee for the opportunity to cancel your flight.

### "rude and disrespectful"
Not Verified |  Las Vegas to Stockton. Yesterday during our departure an employee at the gate, pulling people out of line. She was checking to make sure that people had paid for carry on luggage. She didn’t check everyone just people she didn’t “seem” to like. One was my wife. She rudely pulled us out of line told us we hadn’t paid for one of our bags and then told us to “pay”. She did this in front of all the other passengers. She was also doing this to other passengers. She was rude and disrespectful. The other passengers became irritated at her and began calling her names. This lady delayed the flight over a few on unpaid bags. My wife’s bag was an oversight not done intentionally however this lady embarrassed us and the other passengers.

### "should be held accountable"
Los Angeles to Oklahoma City. Absolute worst airline ever. Flew out to LA for a weekend, our returning flight was cancelled without reschedule. We were left stranded in LAX with nowhere to go except spend $1000 per person x6 to get a one way home. This was on a Sunday, we were not given any alternative options. The airline posted a delay for 2 hours, after 2.5 hours we were one of two that received an automated call saying the flight was cancelled. Only 2 people out of an entire plane were notified. The attendants wouldn’t even tell us! When asked what we could do they offered to book us on the Thursday flight, leaving us to pay for everything for 5 days without reimbursement and they also couldn’t guarantee the flight! There were so many families on the plane stranded without any money or the ability to do anything at all and the airlines wasn’t accommodating or helpful in the least. It was so sad to watch these people scramble to figure out what to do. Many of which were left in huge financial distress because they had no other option! It disgusting that an airline is allowed to operate under this lack of service and zero federal regulations. We had to purchase astronomical one way tickets to the closest airport and rent a car home on our own dime without any offer of help. It’s disgusting. Allegiant Air should be held accountable. No one should pay their hard earned money for a service and be left stranded without a way out! It’s absolutely despicable.

### "not be using this airline again"
Omaha to Las Vegas. My wife and I were not able to leave for our late honeymoon because there were maintenance issues with our plane that delayed the flight almost 24 hours. After waiting on hold for almost 45 minutes and having to call several times to actually speak to a person I was told the only option was reimbursement for the flight (which would take us off the flight plan) or they could put us on a flight in Grand Island as long as we were willing to drive there. This would have been ok accept the flight left in 2 hours and the drive was just over two hours leaving us with no options even after asking for any kind of connecting flight. A friend of ours who would have been on the same flight received a $100 voucher for the flight being delayed and was reimbursed for the hotel she was unable to make it to, but we were not given the same treatment. I asked if we would be compensated for the inconvenience but was told there was "simply nothing we can do" and they would not reimburse us for our hotel because we did not book the hotel through their website because they were "not responsible" even though the only reason we didn't get to the hotel was because of the airline leaving them at fault. All together the airline did nothing for our inconvenience and the representative I spoke to made no attempt to help with our situation. My wife and I will not be using this airline again.

### "worst travel experiences"
Provo to Mesa. This is hands down one of the absolute worst travel experiences I’ve had with the worst airline company I’ve ever dealt with. We are very unhappy and displeased & this is not our first issue with Allegiant. I am very upset with this company & bothered from start to finish!! They have lost many customers (myself, my family and friends) from this situation & their lack of help/response. We were at the airport & a very light snow flurry started that lasted less than 10 min. They tell us that there has to be a over ¼ of a mile visibility for the plane to land. Within a few minutes of the storm hitting we could see to the lake which is about 1 mile away. They then told us that the “plane does not have enough gas to circle while waiting for weather” They said that the plane had to fly back to Mesa (over an hr flight) to fuel up. We find this upsetting & hard to believe as the FAA has very specific rules and guidelines about how much gas a plane has to have. They should have had enough to circle & wait for the short flurry to pass. I have been on planes before that circled for 30 or more minutes before turning to go somewhere else. Even had a plane turn back around and land where we were supposed to after circling and waiting. So this is completely unacceptable! We are then told it will be a 2 hr delay (in the worst, most uncomfortable and claustrophobic airport I’ve been in) so they can go fill up the plane. This is upsetting & frustrating but we can handle a 2 hr delay. Shortly after this we are told that it would be even more delayed further into the evening causing a 10 hour delay. They said that they did not have snow removal equipment at the airport so the plane can’t come back. How does an airport in Utah not have snow removal equipment? It snows there half the year but they don’t have the equipment!! But then we see a snow plow in the parking lot.. All of this is completely uncalled for, unnecessary and ridiculous. If we had been in the Salt Lake airport we would have taken off and been in our destination on time. We had to pay for an uber to get us to and from the airport which cost us even more money. Thankfully we live within 30 min of the airport. When we got back to the airport there is another delay! The incoming plane doesn’t land until it is almost time for our flight to take off. They finally load the plane and we sit on the tarmac for an extended period of time waiting without any reason, they never told us why we weren’t taking off. Once we land we then sit on the tarmac again, once again with no explanation. When we were on the plane we were not offered anything as an apology, no free snacks or drinks from the over priced selection. Staff did not seem apologetic for the issues or problems with the flights! Our entire first day of the trip was completely gone and ruined! I have been trying to contact customer service since this all happened. I have emailed a few times with no response. I spent about 4 hours trying to call Allegiant today to no avail.

### "not had a problem with them"
Not Verified |  I have flown with Allegiant Airlines several times over the past few months and not had a problem with them. They get me to the destination I need to go, and no issues with check in or boarding. They may not serve any complimentary drinks or snacks unless you buy it but that doesn’t matter to me since the flights I’ve been taking are only about an hour and a half long. I also had my flight canceled recently due to bad weather but I called to reschedule my flight for another day and their customer service was efficient and great, and made the rescheduling very easy. I would recommend flying with Allegiant, especially for shorter distance flights. I’ll definitely be flying with them again in the future.

### "relatively pleasant flights"
I have used Allegiant Air two times over the last few months. Once from Boise to Las Vegas and from Boise to Mesa. Both times I was on an Airbus A320 and had relatively pleasant flights. Service was easy and the people at the desk in the airports and customer service (phone) were friendly and helpful. The only drawbacks from my experience were the customer service phone wait time (over an hour) and paying for a carry on. However, on my second flight after a little more research I found that Veterans get free checked bags and carry ons which was very cool. My flights were short (under 2 hours) so the snack situation was not an issue. Big point is if you do your research and read the info provided by them then you should have no complaints. I've seen too many bad reviews where people complain about stuff they would have known if they researched and read what was provided to them. Those reviews make me laugh and are unhelpful to say the least and I give them an unhelpful vote whenever I can. I wholeheartedly would recommend Allegiant and will happily fly them again.

### "treated so unprofessionally"
Oakland to Bellingham. The flight associate at the ticket counter at Oakland airport was very rude. As I got in the line, one associate was already yelling at another customer who had issues with his carryon bag, he was treated so badly and was threatened with security. Then came my turn when a different associate half sleepy (6am) doesn’t even greet and was damn rude about my bag being 5 pounds overweight, I said I will take out items and balance it out, she just stood there yawning and making rude comments while I was balancing the weight. I asked her if she was having a bad morning and she said no I’m having fantastic morning. Never ever in my life have I been treated so unprofessionally at an airline ticket counter. I will think twice next time flying this airline.

### "never use Allegiant Air again"
Orlando Sanford to Tri State Milton. I will never use Allegiant Air again or recommend them. They charged me for 2 people when it should have been 1 on a trip from FL to VA. I tried to call them but no one ever actually answers the phones, so I could not see for sure of the double charge till I received my monthly credit card bill. I emailed them to ask for a correction and a refund, had to wait a long time for their response and was basically told too bad, so sad, no refund for you! I will never use their services again. I was double charged because of a mistake due to their part and left feeling angry and disgusted. Horrible Customer Relations and Service.

### "they won't refund me"
Horrible customer service. I didn't pick up the rental thru them due to me losing my license the day before and they won't refund me. I called Alamo and they said they cant refund that Allegiant have to but they mention they wont refund you due to them still trying to make money through a rental. But I didn't use it?

### "Very poor communication"
Not Verified |  Louisville to Punta Gorda. Very poor communication during incident on arrival during disembarking the plane with 30 minute delay without explanation or apologies. A similar delay at Louisville 30 mins near gate but unable to off load on 20 November due to gate occupancy. Service and communication poor at best.

### "Knew I was in good hands"
Syracuse to Ft Lauderdale. Flight in both directions on time. Pilot did excellent job take off and landing. Same with return flight. Pilots greeted passengers as we left plane. Knew I was in good hands. Planes were nice.

### "I definitely don't recommend"
Richmond to Nashville. Arrived 75 minutes prior to our flight departure from RIC, which is a small airport (2 terminals). Had to wait in line 50 minutes to drop off our checked bag after mobile check-in. Mobile check-in wasn’t working and people were being returned from security because passes weren’t being accepted. 1 person working behind ticket counter to process the entire flight! Working the final 7 people in line, she calls the gate (in front of me) to let them know how many people are left and that she’s working us thru and we will make the flight. Got thru security and to the gate only to find the pilot “made the decision” to depart on time and leave passengers standing at the gate. No luggage because it was already on the plane. No additional flight because there’s only 1 per day. Sit on hold 70 minutes to get a representative who re-books on different airline, for 10pm that night. Their flight was then delayed until the next day, so a hotel stay and nearly 24hrs later, we leave for our trip. Was told by Allegiant they were short-staffed that day which caused a disruption. The pilot was more concerned with leaving on-time than taking care of the customer. It’s beyond comprehension they could not wait an additional few minutes for the rest of the passengers to clear security since they only offger 1 flight every 3 days? So this “economy flight” ultimately cost more than traveling a normal airline, caused a lot of additional stress because of very little customer service, and ruined the first-time flight experience for a little girl. I definitely don't recommend.

### "just one minute late"
Charleston to Indianapolis. Ineptness begins with their phone service. Either you get put on hold for hours or reach travel agents from India. The next thing is their manipulative and deceptivity at their ticket counters where, if you are just one minute late, they aren’t there. Then there is their pettiness, where they get back at their distraught customers for yelling by not applying the refunds they had previously agreed to, the biggest all around assessment is their ineptness, so be glad if you miss your flight or something.

### "never seems to be on time"
Not Verified |  Oklahoma City to Los Angeles. Terrible airline. Delayed our flight for 4 hours so it was past midnight. They never explained the reason for the delay, and then when boarded the plane one of the engines went out so we got stuck for another couple of hours. This airline never seems to be on time. Its not that cheap compared to other airline and I regret getting its credit card. will use it to buy American Airlines tickets instead, at least much more reliable

### "Fantastic airline"
Not Verified |  Flew Mesa, AZ to Missouri. Fantastic airline! Very clean and the plane was roomy. I highly recommend Allegiant Air to friends and family! Easy check in and the lines move fast. Very professional personnel.

### "copy of their birth certificate"
I love Allegiant's price, but when it comes to flying with children it is the worst. If you are flying with a child that is 2 or under on your lap you have to have a hard copy of their birth certificate which I think is the dumbest thing. If you don’t have one then they will make you buy a ticket for that child or you can’t fly. With all other airlines you just need a picture which makes my life a whole lot easier and less stressful, plus I don’t want to fly with my child’s hard copy because it could get damaged or even lost.

### "so disappointed with Allegiant Air"
I am very disappointed in Allegiant Air. I find that they are very greedy in wanting to charge every little thing. My husband and I are traveling to Arizona for a little vacation and booked our flights weeks ahead of time. There are plenty of seats left on the plane. I have never had this ever happen to me when we book together. We don’t care if we sit up front or in the back. Usually when you book together, you get seated together. Unless, it’s a full flight then I understand why seats are needed to be bought. Needless to say, it is not a full flight. We are traveling with an infant and of course they see that and had to split us up knowing we would have to pay to sit together. Like I said, never had this ever happen to us with any airline. There were plenty of open seats left when we called and they said it was a 50/50 chance. Well what are the odds of them splitting a family. All they said was if we put the infant with one adult. Well no duh. Of course our son had to be with one adult. I can’t inagine why they would split him up too. And he was a lap seat. So he wouldn’t be needing to split up. Allegiant Air customer service was not helpful or great but of course we had to pay to get our seat changed knowing there’s other seats available. It’s definitely a tactic strategy that they had to do to charge for every little thing. Other airlines would have never had this happen. I am so disappointed with Allegiant Air. Will never fly with them again.

### "Worst experience ever"
Orlando to Little Rock. Worst experience ever. All passengers had to deplane due to “paperwork” screw up. Flight was several hours late. Had to sit on the new plane for an hour on the runway after having to change gates. It was mass confusion and they didnt know what was going on.

### "never fly Allegiant again"
I was on flight 2138 yesterday with "nonstop service" from Orlando Sanford to Concord NC. Our flight was initially delayed for "mechanical issues". We boarded, were then deplaned (still in Sanford) and loaded up onto another plane. When we descended into Concord, our pilot had to pull up abruptly two times because of missed approaches. This scared many people on the plane, but that's not the worst part. Many people on the plane had family members on the ground who were waiting for their arrival. We were told since our pilot couldn't land us, Allegiant instructed him to return to Sanford. Everyone was disappointed by that decision, considering there were dozens of closer airports to divert to. On our way back to Sanford, we were told we would stop in Savannah to refuel. While we were stretching our legs on the jet bridge, we were told we would attempt Concord again. A few moments later, we were told the jetbridge hit the door of the plane and we would be grounded until further notice. Remember those people sitting at the airport in Concord waiting for their loved ones? At this point, most of them finally had a chance to talk to their loved ones. While they were at the airport, Allegiant refused to give them any answers about what happened to the plane and why it didn't land. They hid from the terrified people who wondered why their loved ones' plane didn't land. When I finally called my mother from Savannah, she was hysterically crying and told me that her and three other people stood outside in the 46 degree rain to watch for the plane at the fence, when Allegiant couldn't give them any answers as to where it was. Was Allegiant scared to hint that their pilot was incompetent because other planes were landing safely at that time? Whatever it is, it's not fair what they put the people on the ground through yesterday. My flight was supposed to arrive at 2:29 PM and finally got in around 12:30 midnight. 10 hours late. The flight attendants did their best to accommodate passengers, however we were told we were only allowed one free snack and drink & the FA's were too flustered to accept payments. Many people missed lunch and dinner during this ordeal, including children, and the least Allegiant could do is offer up snacks to these people who were unable to eat meals. One flight attendant stood out from the rest and we could really tell she had the best intentions for everyone on that plane. She did the best she could to keep everyone comfortable, while still trying to follow Allegiant's stingy orders. All in all, this was my first flight experience with Allegiant. As a fairly frequent flyer with other airlines, I opted for Allegiant because the airport is small, convenient and only 5 minutes from my house. I understand that mechanical problems happen. I even get that the pilot didn't feel comfortable with landing the plane (maybe he needs to be trained better). What I can't forgive is the terrible communication from Allegiant to our loved ones on the ground and the bad call to "send us back to Sanford", where I'm sure you would have deplaned us & cancelled the flight, leaving us stranded. I literally could have driven from Orlando to Concord NC faster and made it there safer than I felt on your plane. Please use this as a learning opportunity because there were many people on our flight who swore to never fly Allegiant again.

### "Absolutely the worst"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Grand Rapids. Absolutely the worst. Lost one of our bags. No one from Allegiant was available anywhere to help us. The only representatives would be at the ticket counter and they are only there when checking in a departing flight. Calls to baggage customer service went to voicemail and their mailbox is full! Wait times for general customer service were 15+ minutes and we're futile. Absolutely no solutions! Airport guest services tried to get in touch with them, but basically gave the impression that this is a common occurrence with them. I don't understand how a company can operate this way.

### "worst customer service"
Bellingham to Las Vegas. The worst customer service ever. Cancelled the flight, even though other Allegiant flight took off. Refused to put us on that flight because they were not able to print the tickets. No apology, the supervisor didn't even show up. Gave a food voucher for $8. Don't take a chance to ruin your vacation.

### "didn’t care and were not helpful"
I bought 2 tickets from Austin to Destin along with a rental car. The flight was fine, but when we went to get our car that we had already paid for, they could not do it because we did not have a major credit card for the car to be rented. I asked the person I was with if we could put it under their MasterCard so It would be no big deal, but the car rental company would not let us. I called Allegiant and asked if they could switch the name on the reservation to the name on the credit card and they said no. There was nothing more to it, other than I had to eat the money I had already paid for a rental car on the reservation. They didn’t care and were not helpful that they had left me stranded at an airport. I’d pay the extra money for an airline that actually cares about its customers.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Fresno to Las Vegas. Charged me $200 for a carry on bag, not check bag, carry on! Absolutely ridiculous. After my trip I called Allegiant Air and they were rude and did not help me at all. They do have cheap flights but they make up for it in the baggage fees and on flight beverages. The only flight I know of that will charge for a glass of water. I will never fly Allegiant again!

### "we ending up getting a sauna"
Not Verified | Flight 2246 from Orlando to San Antonio, everything was ok and the flight was on time. The punishment started after they closed the door at 3.00 pm. The flight supposes to be for 3.12 pm. We was happy for going before the real departing time. We noticed the was no air conditioner running in the cabin. After they close the door the situations turned from bad to worst in a matter of minutes. My wife have a High Blood Pressure, I have to raise my voice to the flight attendant, he said "all going to be OK, after we are moving on the runaway" he was wrong dead, we move for minutes and stop again. The situation was boiling and everybody was complaining, finally some one notified the passengers that this flight will we delayed, no one say for how long. After been in this "sauna" for over a hour and half, finally this flight 2246 starting the runaway, but the air conditioner never came. From 530 pm, east time to the arrival in San Antonio there was not air at all. Many time we has flight with Allegiant Air, some time we have one or two delayed but never ever something like this. What is bother me is the miscommunication with the the passengers. Also the noise inside the cabin was so loud that we don't heard the instruction coming from the pilot. We paid for a flight and we ending up getting a "sauna" and the chamber of horror, we paid to get a comfortable flight and we ending getting a nightmare. I was there and many "sauna passenger" was saying "this is the last time we will flight with Allegiant". If the company do the thing the correct way I, am the first to complimented, but in this time I raise my voice to complaint, this is wrong and do not reflect the real value and the standards of this company.

### "have zero compassion"
Not Verified | Orlando to Syracuse. Was meant to fly with Allegiant on Thursday but had to cancel my trip due to a family bereavement. Now most airlines and travel companies offer refunds for bereavements with an upload of death certificate. Not Allegiant. Upon closer inspection in there terms and conditions they do not offer refunds for bereavements to 'keep fares low'. Allegiant: At least have the courtesy to amend your terms and conditions to speak the truth and say 'we do not offer refunds on bereavements because we as a company have zero compassion and don't view flexibility for the bereaved as a decent thing to do. As a business we feel that maintaining our status as a budget airline is way more important than being decent human beings

### "I’m shocked right now"
Des Moines to Las Vegas. I’m shocked right now. I feel like I should decompress and take a few days before writing a review but the threatening behavior and jokes made are far too unprofessional to not write about, immediately. I hope this review discourages people from flying with Allegiant Air. After the 4th person near me complained about the flight attendant, I figured screw it - she may be having a bad day or something because she was being so rude and short with customers, but I must file a complaint. I travel for a living and I’ve never experienced such obnoxious service. Well, anyway, I didn’t want to be confrontational so I asked her co-worker for her name. He flipped out on me. I went from filing a complaint to feeling like I was about to have to defend myself. The guy clearly works out with his physical shape so I’m assuming he had maybe, a steroid rage moment - but the conversation ended with him leaning toward my face in an aggressive manner saying “what, are you gunna do - you some kind of tough guy - I’ll make it so you never fly this airline again!” I simply responded with “Don’t worry, I will never fly this airline again.” Then he literally started to lip talking insults to me from 2 rows away. I was sitting in 4D so I was near the front where he was sitting. He was egging me on as if to provoke a fight. Just crazy. So unprofessional.

### "will be cancelled or delayed"
Cincinnati to Jacksonville. Don't have set plans, as your flight will be cancelled or delayed. This airline is such a joke. Everyone I know has had problems. So, yeah, take a different airline.

### "definitely fly Allegiant again"
Not Verified |  Richmond to Nashville. We flew out of RIC on Monday Sept 24, 2018. We were 45 mins late leaving, arrived 45 mins late in Nashville. This was not a big problem for us. We had read many bad reviews, so 45 mins late was ok. The crew were fine and courteous. The flight back to RIC on Friday, Sept 28, 2018 was fantastic. Left on time, arrived on time. Crew was again nice and courteous. I would definitely fly Allegiant again. I think some of the problems on the ground that people complain about are related to not having enough employees to work at the ticket counter, etc. But, that's also how they keep prices down. We were so happy that we had a good experience.

### "policies extremely deceptive"
Allegiant Air travel insurance and cancellation policies are extremely deceptive. You purchase these so changes or cancellations can be made without additional fees, right? But they don't inform you of the additional charges for cancellations. And that if you do it online you get a fee for that too. And they are a no refund company as well. So just kiss your money goodbye. We just won't go to how rude customer service is. So rude, would not let me speak, kept speaking over me.

### "Do not use Allegiant"
Nashville to Myrtle Beach. I booked my flight in July not knowing that a catastrophic hurricane would hit the week before I fly. I called them to cancel letting them know I would not be able to even get out of the airport to go visit family in Lumberton NC because all the roads were either flooded or caving in. They showed no sympathy and said basically I’m outta luck and gave me a small credit for a future flight. So if this was my first flight with them what makes them think I would use them again. Do not use Allegiant Air.

### "would not reimburse me"
Myrtle Beach to New York. I live in Wilmington, NC and we were just hit by a catastrophic hurricane. All the roads are flooded and trees are down everywhere. I called Allegiant and Spirit Airlines as I will not be able to travel (my home was ruined by the storm) and all the roads out of town are flooded. Spirit understood that this is a natural disaster and reimbursed me the full amount of my flight. Allegiant would not reimburse me, they told me that they are not a company who reimburses. They would only give me a small credit for a future flight, not the actual price I paid ($160). I think this is a true reflection of the company. The customer service was horrible (waited over 30 minutes for a representative) and both the employee and their manager were extremely condescending.

### "flight experience was awesome"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Eugene. This was my first time flying Allegiant, using them for the cheapest fare for a trip to Oregon from Sept 7-10 for our family of 4. I didn't think to look at reviews until the day before our departure and I was horrified by what I read. But I prayed hard and remained hopeful and our flight experience was awesome! On time departures on both ends. On time arrival on the front end and early arrival on the back end. First plane must have been new-so clean that it sparkled, no dust or grime or scratches or anything! The plane on our return wasn't as immaculate but I would still consider it clean. Flight attendants friendly and I appreciated their diversity in age, look, size, etc. I chose to save money by not selecting seats in advance because I knew that our kids wouldn't be seated alone. It worked out great that my husband was seated near the kids and I got a break by sitting across the aisle or, even better, two rows behind on the flight back! I thought the seats were the most comfortable I've ever experienced, and I've been flying for almost 50 years, both domestic and internationally. I must admit that I'm 5'2", not overweight, and prefer firm straight-back chairs which probably doesn't characterize most folks, but I loved the seating. There was enough wiggle room in the seat and in front for legs/feet. The guy next to me stretched his arms behind his head and there was enough room that I didn't get elbowed in the temple. The center aisle felt really spacious to me which is funny because I know it's not that wide but there was enough room to walk with bags and not bang into armrests or passengers knees. Customer service before the flight was totally lacking. Tried calling in July and no one ever answered. Emailed instead on July 20 and got a reply 3 weeks later on Aug 8 which said my concern about rental car timing was handled, only to find out the day before our trip that it wasn't fixed. Luckily, someone answered the customer service phone that day I called after 40min of wait time, and I got great service for that issue. Overall, I was pleased flying Allegiant and would use them again.

### "forced to buy the seats"
Not Verified |  Phoenix to Great falls. I fly Allegiant air quite frequently and am always disgusted by their flight attendants and staff. However, today I am beyond over them. I brought my liquids in the exact amount that is allowed on the plane from Phoenix to Montana there were absolutely no issues with the liquids. However today on the way back it is now against their policy. So I had to throw away over a $100 worth of soap, shampoo, conditioner, and other things you need on vacation. This is not my only issue they are always rude, absolutely nothing is free and everything is over priced. They talk to everyone like they are children and refuse to allow anyone switch seats because and I quote "the plane has been weight calculated based on everyone sitting in their assigned seat. I had to pay an extra $47 today in order for the three of us to sit next to each other! We bought our tickets together and we are traveling with my son. There is no reason that we should have to pay extra in order for us to sit next to each other! Good luck trying to switch seats. So you are forced to buy the seats. Cheap is proving to not be worth the constant headache.

### "delayed for 6 hours"
Not Verified |  Louisville to Savannah. Worst for customer service. Flight delayed for 6 hours. Did not offer to feed anyone with the long layover. Was told if we removed our luggage we would lose our ticket and money for the flights. After asking to deplane and then plane was ready to go it was then used to fly other passengers to Fort Lauderdale. As of 8.30 PM we still have not heard whether we get to travel or not. We lost money on our hotel rental car that we had to pay for and not even in the city to get to use.

### "no longer a viable option"
Not Verified | Tri Cities to Orlando Sanford. On the last 5 times myself or a family member has flown Allegiant, the flight has been delayed at least 2 hours for mechanical problems. I believe the convenience of flying out of tri cities is no longer a viable option and my family and friends will be going to Charlotte to my make our trips to Florida.

### "Poor customer service"
Departing Flight from Cincinnati to St. Pete–Clearwater departed 25 mins before departure time. Returning flight was cancelled due to early departure from the departing flight. That was my first and last encounter with Allegiant. Poor customer service via the phone.

### "worst experience ever"
Grand Rapids to Las Vegas. The worst experience ever. Our flight was over an hour delayed and there was no information available giving notice. The employee at the gate told everyone to follow her, then when we did she made us all turn around and told us we were going go all go to jail for trying to board the plane without getting our boarding pass scanned. I paid extra for priority boarding and extra leg room but if you are in an exit row, you are not allowed to board priority. Which we didn't know until we were trying to get on the plane. The plane itself was in need of updating and repairs. The carpet with coming up and the seats were stained. I called to talk to someone about the priority boarding situation and was told "A supervisor is available to listen to your concern but cannot do anything about it so you will have to email the company. After waiting on hold for 14 minutes. Worst. Experience. Ever. Oh! And we booked transportation from the airport to the hotel through allegiant which uses Bell's transportation and the bus broke down in the middle of the road and because we didn't book directly through bells, they will not refund our transportation fee.

### "works great"
Denver to Cincinnati with Allegiant Air. Seemed fine, left on time, you can take a backpack "for free. Expect to pay $2 for a soda or what not on the plane if desired (though you can actually bring food from home or from the airport [except drinks, only from the airport] through security and onto the plane). Only bummer is having to pay extra to pick seats. But you might be able to work around it by paying for the seats "at checkin time" (i.e. online) so you only have to pay for reserved seating of 3/4 of them or what not, if all you care about is sitting together. So, basically if you have a flexible departure time frame and don't check bags, and don't need inflight entertainment, works great! They even let us have our 1.5 year old sit on "mom's lap" no problems.

### "seats are the narrowest"
Nashville to St. Petersburg. This was my first (and last) experience with Allegiant. The fare price was great but other than that there was not much good. When I arrived at the airport about 90 before the flight I received a text that my 12:44 pm flight was going to be delayed to 2:55 pm. Not a big deal but when I checked the board in the airport it still showed everything on time. I also got an email at this time with a $50 travel voucher from the airline. So I called home to let my wife know and told her to watch the flight so she could pick me up at the airport. At 1:41pm I got another text pushing the flight to 5:34 pm. Again, no update on the airport boards and apparently not on the internet either as my wife called when she was at the airport to pick me up and I answered the phone, still in Nashville! At around 4 pm someone with some customer service savvy brought pizza to the gate for everyone waiting. While all of this was going on the info board at the gate was out of service and there were no announcements from the gate agents who were sitting around in the wheel chairs at the gate. Finally, at around 5 pm we boarded the flight. Once loaded, the flight attendants and gate agents came through the plane at least 7 times by could not agree on a passenger count. I know this was the issue because I was sitting near the front and could hear everyone trying to blame each other for the issue. We sat on the plane until a little after 7 pm at the gate waiting for fuel and a good head count. We arrived in St. Pete at 9:36pm 9 hours late when I received a final text saying the flight was going to be delayed until 7 pm. At no time was an announcement made on board letting the passengers know what time we would be landing so we could notify people at the destination. The gate agents were nice but not communicative enough. When asked what the delay was I was told that a "Rescue" plane was being sent. That was alarming considering Allegiant's maintenance history. The plane was nice and I am sure that they have the widest aisles in the industry because I am also sure that the seats are the narrowest. I paid extra for more leg room but if the seat I got had more leg room I could not find it. Overall a horrible experience. I have well over 1,000,000 miles in the air and this was the worst!

### "they don't have enough agents"
Concord to Punta Gorda. I purchased a flight and added Flex Trip to my purchase. I went online to make a change to my departure flight from August 24th to Sept 7th. The amount to change my flight showed $0. When I went to add my seat assignment it stated that I owed $11. I already paid the same amount for my original seat assignment so I called their customer service team. I waited on hold for 50 min. The rep told me that the seat prices change daily. All I wanted was to sit in the same row and asked why I had to pay for my seat again. She told me that I was not paying for the seat I was paying for a change in my flight. She quoted that I would have to pay and extra $4. However, my flight change states that I have a zero charge, not to mention that I have Flex Trip and nowhere in their policy does it state that I have to pay again for my seat. I asked to speak to a supervisor and she refused. Stating a supervisor cannot help me. In summary, they don't have enough agents to answer the phones, they remind you of how you can go to their online portal to make changes yet the price they quote on the portal is higher than the price given by the agent, they do not honor their policy when purchasing flex trip and they refuse to provide you with a supervisor.

### "Customer service is horrible"
Knoxville  to Orlando. Customer service is horrible. Waited for four hours for ticket counter to open. Was told I could not check my bag because my flight was more than two hours from departing. However, the ticket agent was checking in another flight that was more than two hours from departing.

### "I was very impressed"
Not Verified |  Destin/Ft Walton Beach to Oklahoma. This was the 1st time we had actually flown. I was very impressed with how smoothly things went. We arrived at the airport to park in the long term parking area, went right to baggage check in, went thru TSA and boarded the plane with no problems at all. The plane ride there and back was very smooth. I was concerned with the reviews regarding the seats and leg room, but this proved to be no problem at all. My husband is a big guy and had plenty of room. The seats could be a little more comfortable, but our flight was less then 2 hours so it wasn't an issue.

### "miserable flight experience"
St Pete to Richmond. Allegiant is the most miserable flight experience. The customer service alone completely ruins my experience every time. The flight attendants could not be more rude and customer service remains consistent every time: rude, unpleasant, unfriendly. Pay more to fly with a different airline to ensure that you are treated correctly.

### "all staff were rude"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Medford. Even if I ignored the extra 110$ of which I ridiculously paid for for printing the boarding pass and and my carry on. All staff were rude and always looked for opportunity to add more charges to me. My conclusion is that I bought this flight because it was a little cheaper, but after the extra 110$ (on top of the 280$ I paid) it turned out it wasn't cheaper than the other companies. And now on top of this I was stuck with poor seats and service. By the way, they didn't even have space for my bag, so it's under my legs right now while writing this. Me or anybody I know will never fly with Allegiant again! Have a safe trip!

### "worst flying experience"
Indianapolis to Fort Lauderdale. The worst flying experience of my life. We have been waiting on the plane to take off for an hour and a half. No worries the captain keep informing us that they are "trying to figure it out. Thank god for Allegiant. I will never be giving them my business again.

### "delayed due to maintenance"
Concord to Fort Lauderdale. Don’t ever give these people money you’ll hate yourself for it. I was stuck in a tiny airport with two gates for almost 7 hours because our flight was delayed due to maintenance. They shouldn’t even have the privilege to own an airline what a joke, kept telling us the plane was in the air and would be landing shortly, it went from 4:00pm to 9:30pm to 9:45pm to “its in the air” it’ll be here in 50 minutes then 50 minutes later they said it would arrive in 30 minutes and said that about 3 more times after that. Don’t ever waste your time with these hooligans.

### "will not use them again"
San Antonio to Las Vegas. I have no complaints about the staff. They were pleasant but the company as a whole seems unorganized. I was delayed on both trips to and from over an hour and half on the to and over an hour from. If you need to be some where on time please don’t use this company! If you have time to waste and want to save money then you should use them. I personally will not use them again.

### "worst airline ever"
Tampa to Columbus. Absolute worst airline ever I highly recommend you take your money else where they're nothing but a headache and very unorganized as a company I made it to the airport 1 hour and 10 minutes before my flight which left at 8am and I had downloaded the allegiant app as prompted on my itinerary and went to the front desk and they directed me to my gate once I made it to the TSA check in they were unable to scan the bar code off the app so I was told to go back the front desk so they can print me a copy of my boarding pass well once I got back to the front desk they told me it would be a 5 dollar charge to print and that they only accepted credit which I didn't have on me only had cash but he insisted that the app would work and to try again. I went back and again it didn't work and I even expressed how upset I was to the TSA attendant so he tried a few times for me and still nothing so again I go back to the counter because he suggested they could just use the card the flight was purchased with for the boarding pass well. I went over to the counter again and they scanned it just fine and claimed that if it worked at there desk then it would work at the check in so I took a screenshot of the barcode and zoomed in on it and it and it worked the third time finally and went through security. Even though all the running around it was still only 7:44 so I proceeded to my gate which was empty not a person in sight so I went to the next gate and asked where the flight to Columbus boarded and told me I had missed it, I asked how could that be it wasn't supposed to leave until 8 and she told me doors close 15 mins prior to departure and i looked at my phone 7:46 and said so 1 minute ago and she said sorry there's nothing she can do. I asked to speak with a manager and she told me I would have to go all the way to the front desk so at this point I knew I was screwed because the front desk is on the other side of the building and I would have to go through security again so I go to the front desk and of course there isn't a manager on duty and that I would have to call customer care so I do and explain the whole situation and they tell me there is nothing they can do for me besides charge me for the next flight which is two days out.

### "aren’t friendly and very unorganized"
I wish I could rate Allegiant Air under 0 stars because that’s its value. I understand charging for a carry on bag. But if you didn’t pay on your way there at your first departing airport they shouldn’t charge you on your returning flight, especially $50 that’s absurd for a two and a half hour flight. Definitely won’t fly Allegiant again. The staff at Elmira Airport aren’t friendly and very unorganized.

### "Do not fly Allegiant"
Nashville to Ft Walton/Destin. Do not fly Allegiant. My Granddaughter, daughter, and myself were stranded in Ft. Walton Florida July 9, 2018 due to pilot clipping another Allegiant aircraft causing our flight to be cancelled. They wouldn't assist with letting us know why our flight was cancelled, what our options were, or anything until almost 4 hours after they had cancelled the flight. All they offered was a refund for our returning flight, or to put us on the next flight (with them) to Nashville which was not until Friday July 13th (Keep in mind this was a Monday, when we were suppose to be going home) which left us to find transportation, lodging, and accrue additional food expenses for the 3 of us, during one of the busiest tourist seasons in Florida, and it was all at our own expense due to and I quote “ We are a small company and not able to assist you with your unexpected monetary expenses” So we were on our own, stuck, frustrated, and incredibly stressed due to having to find last minute lodging, car rental, having extra food expenses, and my daughter almost losing her job because we could not return home when scheduled her company expected her to be there Tuesday July 10th to work but due to us being stuck in Florida with no options to get home until We finally found an option with Southwest airlines, granted it was out of Pensacola, Florida, for Wednesday July 11th, now this was a last minute flight so our tickets cost us $327.00 each totaling $981.00 plus all of the other expenses of the two days/nights prior, the stress from not knowing how we would get home, where we were even going to stay and sleep at night while having my young granddaughter with me. It was a very traumatic experience for all 3 of us, along with a lot of additional expenses that should not have been our responsibility to pay for, due to the airlines pilot clipping another aircraft. I have sent 3 emails to corporate since we have returned home and still NO response.

### "Worst experience ever"
Indianapolis to St Pete Clearwater. Worst experience ever. My flight was delayed twice without even notifying me, I found out through a friend who happened to be scheduled for the same flight. The delay was 6 hours and there was no reason provided. I cancelled my flight and got a refund. However, they ruined my weekend plans and had me take half a day off work thinking my flight was leaving at 5pm instead of 11pm (the airport is an hour away from me). Customer service left me on hold for so long and the manager was not helpful either. Horrible first and last experience with Allegiant.

### "very traumatic experience"
Nashville to Fort Walton Beach. I would give 0 out of 5 stars if that was an option! My mother, daughter, and myself were stranded in Ft. Walton Florida July 9, 2018 due to pilot clipping another Allegiant aircraft causing our flight to be cancelled. They wouldn't even assist with letting us know why our flight was cancelled, what our options were, or anything until almost 4 hours after they had cancelled the flight. All they offered was a refund for our returning flight, or to put us on the next flight (with them) to Nashville which was not until Friday July 13th (Keep in mind this was a Monday, when we were suppose to be going home) which left us to find transportation, lodging, and accrue additional food expenses for the 3 of us, during one of the busiest tourist seasons in Florida, and it was all at our own expense due to and I quote “ We are a small company and not able to assist you with your unexpected monetary expenses” So we were on our own, stuck, frustrated, and incredibly stressed due to having to find last minute lodging, car rental, having extra food expenses, and almost losing my job because i could not return to work from us being stuck in Florida with no options to get home. We finally found an option with Southwest airlines, granted it was out of Pensacola, Florida, for Wednesday July 11th, now this was a last minute flight so our tickets cost us $327.00 each totaling $981.00 plus all of the other expenses of the two days/nights prior, the stress from not knowing how we would get home, where we were even going to stay and sleep at night while having my young daughter with me.

I have sent 3 emails to corporate since we have returned home and still no response.

### "not recommend this airline"
I was very dissatisfied with Allegiant Air. All of the extra fees are very inconvenient and actually frustrating. I would recommend allowing the 50lbs luggage weight requirement instead of 40lbs. The representative at the counter during our return flight was very unprofessional. We also were told contradicting information regarding military baggage allowance. Upon reading the baggage information we noticed that the clerk on our return flight was not knowledgeable of the correct rules and had a nasty attitude. At the baggage terminal we were all standing st the wrong claim area due to incorrect information posted on the screen. We were finally redirected to the correct conveyor belt by an employee. I noticed customers looking for their luggage at the baggage terminal. They were being sent to find the airline office despite the fact that a member in their party was in a wheelchair. I would not recommend this airline to anyone.

### "I would still recommend"
Denver to Bellingham. Staff was great and price was right. Only airline to fly direct. Seats were uncomfortable and don't recline. I would still recommend. Made sure to pay extra for legroom in the exit row. I would fly Allegiant any day over Frontier.

### "No problems whatsoever"
Destin to Indianapolis. No problems whatsoever with this airline. A lot of bad reviews online but this was the first time I have ever flown commercial and it was flawless. Boarding passes were easy from my phone, gate check in was smooth and quick, and flight departed on time and arrived on time. I had flown privately many times with my company but this was my first commercial flight and I was very satisfied for the price I paid. I will definitely fly with Allegiant Air in the future.

### "Do not fly this airline"
Destin to Knoxville. I sat at the airport for more than 7 hours thanks to multiple delays. The Allegiant employees at the airport were not helpful at all. Paid extra for a seat selection and when we were able to board the plane they told us it was open seating. Not to mention, they downgraded to a smaller plane and crammed adults and children into seats. I will not be flying Allegiant again. I will pay the extra money to fly with another airline. I will be calling Allegiant for a reimbursement for the money I spent on my seat. Do not fly this airline.

### "not worth the cost"
Richmond to Nashville. Worst flying experience ever, under staffed, poor communication and absurdly long delays. I spent almost a full day at the airport and still don’t know how I’m getting home. There’s been no communication, and confusion or intentional deception relayed by the staff. This is awful! I have never, in all my years, seen a company run so inefficiently. This is an embarrassment to the airline industry. I do, however give props to the wonderful pilot and flight crew on the way out here. They were understaffed, but provided humor and warm smiles. The pilot was also great. The business is just in complete and utter chaos, which trickles down from what I would imagine is the worst leadership in the industry. This is not worth the cost.

### "adventurous experience"
Let me start my bad experience with a number system. I checked - in online and download the boarding pass. I believe the concept of having E - boarding pass is to save some time at Airport. So I download the boarding pass and went a head to security but unfortunately my boarding pass bar code is not working here I have to mention the security person at check point he was so helpful to guide me using the barcode but no luck the bar code messed up after server attempts he advised me to go and get the boarding pass printed. Me again going back from the check point to the front desk wasted my time double then what it would take. (crazy is that they say they charge 5$ for printing boarding pass in person). Okay let me continue so I went and explained my problem to the lady at front desk she replied “they are very lazy they cannot even zoom the phone” I understand that she is referring to the security folks at check point and then I said me and they tired it several times and it did not work. After me giving the boarding pass to her She asked me “are you Nathan ?” Me what ? No I am not. She asked my first name and last name again. (she has my boarding pass In her hand) dunno why she asked again. When she said are you nathan ? Then I realized that my boarding pass might be messed up with a person name Nathan. While I was going through all this stuff I am worried about losing the flight as they said boarding time is 4:38PM I almost confirmed that I will miss my flight. But the good thing for me and bad thing for airline is some people said “sir, don’t worry they never on time” but still I am little bit tense and the boarding was delayed 30mins because the flight I have to board arrived at gate at 5:13 PM approx. Ultimately I had a very tensed experience because I am not local and staying in USA I am from India and I am visiting my family in San Jose. Thanks Allegiant for the adventurous experience.

### "never travel again with this airline"
Indianapolis to Fort Lauderdale. First time traveling Allegiant and will never travel again with this airline and I haven’t even boarded the plane yet. Sunny, no clouds in Indianapolis and sunny, and no clouds in Fort Lauderdale yet, our flight is delayed 3 hours and counting. Plane is here. Everyone has checked in. Allegiant employees are saying the delay is due to the weather. I just flew through a tropical storm last month in the Caribbean via another airline - can’t be worse than that! Ruined my whole first day of vacation. Will tell everyone I know to avoid at all costs. Would rather pay double to fly a reliable airline than deal with this nonsense. Allegiant Air quick way to eat up your PTO and ruin all your travel plans even on the sunniest of days! All other airlines have a 50 lb bag limit and theirs is 40 lb - it’s gonna cost ya.

### "avoid this inept airline"
Not Verified |  Worst experience of any airline here or overseas. Our first time on this airline. On 7-15-18 delayed over an hour before take off from PGA. On landing at Nashville we were kept 1.5 hours on the plane before it had a gate available. Departure 7-19-18 on arrival at Nashville there was a line of 150 people to a single desk = long wait. 6.15pm flight to Punta Gorda delayed to 7:15 then to 9:15PM. This is what I might expect from some 3rd world Airline. Pay more and avoid this inept airline.

### "return flight was delayed"
Tampa to Louisville. Got delayed due to mechanical issues for 2 hours on the way to Florida and the 2 more due to “crew rest,” whatever that means. Then this return flight was delayed 2 hours soon as we arrive to the airport. We both the plane and all of a sudden the pilot still hasn’t arrived. Then all of a sudden the plane had something that was broken so we had to deplane for another 3 hour delay. Staff are rude and the customer service line rings off the hook with no answers in sight.

### "the worst experience"
Not Verified |  This is the first time I’ve ever flown this airline (I fly every couple months) and it was the worst experience. They charge you for everything, our return flight was canceled and rescheduled for the next day and they are very rude. They did give us travel vouchers we’ll never use and offered to reimburse us for extra expenses. However. I’ve sent receipts via email twice with no response after the “we’ve received your email” response. I waited on hold to talk to someone for 2 hours and 5 minutes for them to tell me there’s nothing they can do and hung up on me. (I was being pleasant this was uncalled for) I can’t believe they’re in business!

### "worth the money you pay"
Not Verified |  Great experience with Allegiant Air. Website was easy to use and loved the ongoing reminders and alerts I was getting. Check In was  easy. Flights were good. Smooth landing. Seats are bit tight and you have to pay for any food/beverages but no big deal as it was a short flight. Definitely worth the money you pay for the flight still. Only issue was temperatures on both flights were very high and too cold for comfort would suggest wearing warm clothes or bring blanket. Would definitely use again and recommend. Wish they were closer than the drive to Niagara Falls NY.

### "not flying this airline again"
So it started off with the morning of my flight. I received a notice that my seat assignment has changed. No big deal” I thought, “it happens to every airline. About an hour after that I received another notification that my flight is delayed an hour. Keep in mind this is around 8AM and my flight was scheduled for 2PM. Again I thought “no big deal it happens”. However, as the day went on my flight kept getting delayed. Eventually we get to the airport and the flight is now delayed to 7PM. So I sit down and relax until it’s time to board. Finally” I think to myself “I can now relax”. I sit down and wait for the rest of the flight to board, that’s when they tell us to deplane due to a maintenance issue. I hoped it wouldn’t take that long, but we were told that it can’t be fixed tonight. We’re told that they are sending a new aircraft but it’s not going to arrive until 11PM. All the while I’m thinking “how can an airline allow this much of a ripple effect to happen, to allow a flight to get delayed 9 hours. I’m not flying this airline again.

### "never fly Allegiant again"
Ft Lauderdale to Concord. Where to start? I have flown Allegiant for a few years because their airport in Concord is much closer (ten minutes) to my daughter's family than the Charlotte airport (forty minutes). But I have never enjoyed it mainly because one is never sure if the flight will happen. But this last trip took the cake and apart from returning home on my existing ticket, I will never, ever fly Allegiant again. I was accompanying my two grandsons, (11 and 14) back to their home on a 3:59 p.m. flight, arrival around 6:00 p.m. on July 13. Around 2:00 I got a text that flight delayed until 5:00, arrival 7:00. The problem was the plane coming to Fort Lauderdale (FTL) had equipment problems. The fact that the waiting area was clogged with folks on an earlier (10:30) flight one lady said, was a bad sign. Then we got an announcement they were sending a "rescue plane", yay, but it was smaller and they needed 4 volunteers and we had to get new seat assignments. Finally we boarded at 5:30 and left, only to land at Sanford, normally a half hour flight, an hour later where we deplaned. We left Sanford on yet another third plane with the same crew. The pilot apologized for the lack of info but said on the prior flight they had lost navigation and instrumentation and so had "been pretty busy". Thank God he and his co. had known what they were doing. The crew came through with the cart and I asked if they really meant to charge for beverages under the circumstances. I got three bottles of water for the boys and for me. We finally touched down at 10:30 p.m. The boys were exhausted. Their parents had tried to call customer service and were told there was a "356 minute wait for an agent"! This morning I got an email with a lousy $50 voucher; I wonder if I could use it for drinks and snacks on the way home, since I will never fly Allegiant again. By the way the agents in FTL were wonderful and patient and tried their best under terrible circumstances. I don't think this airline deserves them. The upshot is that I have never flown an airline where so many of the delays were caused by equipment failures, as opposed to weather issues. Must be a very old, poorly maintained fleet and I no longer trust its safety. My recommendation: run, don't walk away from them.

### "we waited two hours"
Terrible. Delayed three hours and waited for luggage for 2 hours. Our flight time was shorter than the wait for our luggage. No one came to tell us why we were waiting so long, called the airline and they replied with an "unavailable" message. Other flights with Allegiant got their luggage on time while we waited two hours. No one came to explain why, 0/10. Seat trays were small, no food was offered, you could not lean in front and lay down to sleep.

### "bullies you into paying"
Not Verified |  Ft Lauderdale to Cincinnati. On the trip from Cincinnati to Ft. Lauderdale we were delayed 4.5 hours. Communication was horrible from attendants. On the return trip, I was stopped at the counter before boarding. They said the roller bag I was carrying on to place in the overhead bin was too large. Mind you, this is the same 22" roller bag I have flown with for years and placed in an over head bin. In fact, I flew down with this bag in the overhead bin on the same plane as I was returning. I was told I would be charged $50 for an over sized bag or I would not be able to fly. I ended up paying even though I had already paid a charge for carry on. I then boarded the plane and placed it in the overhead bin. I feel Allegiant bullies you into paying for all these "extra" fees to make up for the low airfare. I paid up front only to be hassled as the gate. I will never fly with them again even if they are cheaper.

### "planes are very old"
Portsmouth to Orlando. I would prefer to fly on the newer planes. The planes are very old with no USB slots for charging, no free wifi, no monitors on the back of each seat, the seats are very old and uncomfortable. There's no padding left. Have you ever heard of memory foam cushioning? Not even 1 free can of soda. There was nothing wrong with the flight other than the 2 hour delay. 3 hours of you count the very first change to the flight time a few months earlier. Every time we fly allegiant air there's a delay. The on time percentage must be in the 30% range. Landing and take off went as expected. The flight crew was nice.

### "just got the runaround"
Not Verified |  I purchased 2 tickets round trip from Provo, UT to Los Angeles, CA for myself and my husband. Our return flight was scheduled from LAX on 6/8/18 at 11:50 AM. We spent 2 full days in the airport between delayed and canceled flights. We then get told in the end our flight was canceled completely and we had to find our own way home. We were given 2 prepaid cards and told they had $300 each. After we LA we found out both were empty. We spent an hour and a half on hold on with customer service on 6/10/18 only to be told they couldn't do anything and we had to e-mail in. I ended up speaking to a manager in the Provo airport, and was assured by him that the checks were already in the mail to refund the $600. We have waited over a month and have not received the money back. I am beyond furious at this point. I lost 2 days of work, totaling an amount of $330 in lost wages due to this. I am also out the extra money we had to spend on food while because we were there longer then expected. On top of all of that we our also out the money we had to spend to get myself and my husband home. We keep getting promised over and over that you would fix this and make it right, but in reality we have just got the runaround.

### "they cancelled our flight"
Not Verified |  Ft Walton to Raleigh. I had read that they are unreliable, but the prices were so cheap I couldn’t resist. I wish I had. Sure enough they cancelled our flight with no reasoning. And no apology. I wish I had just paid more for a real airline. Don’t be like me. Don’t fall for their prices.

### "airline is terrible"
Not Verified |  Flew Knoxville to Fort Walton Beach. This airline is terrible, on our flight to Knoxville there was a 3 hour delay due to issues and on the way back there was a 1.5 hour delay due to the passenger count from the computer being different from the flight attendants count. This has been a terrible experience and I will never fly Allegiant Air again!

### "we cannot recommend it"
My review is two-fold. 1) Actual trip experiences and 2) Modification of existing reservations. Trip Experiences: We have flown from Memphis to Orlando on two separate occasions. Seat comfort: Seats are molded plastic with basic pad covering. Seats have no reclining feature, which is uncomfortable on flights over two hours. Flight attendants were generally agreeable, Bag check in lines were long, with a single attendant. Modification of existing reservations: I was unable to modify an existing reservation online. As a result, I placed a call to the call center. It took 1 hour, 23 minutes before I was connected to a call agent. Because of the type of ticket purchased ("standard ticket"), there are "stiff penalties" to make changes. Those penalties are $75 per person, per flight. All the call agent could offer was to waive half of the $300 cancellation fees (total of $150) and my pre-booked bag fee, but would not waive the other half. I was informed it would not be "fair" to the other passengers who paid for the flexible type reservation. Our request to change dates was made 11 days after the original reservations were placed and 2 weeks prior to our trip. Allegiant Airlines will be able to sell the seats we are unable to use and keep all proceeds from the sale of those seats. After adding the penalties for reservation changes to the original ticket prices, we could have flown on a first class carrier for less. Caution to Allegiant fliers, be aware of cancellation/modification penalties when booking your flights. Conclusion: After this third attempt to fly with Allegiant Air, we cannot in good conscious recommend it.

### "sat on the plane for almost 2 hrs"
Not Verified |  Tri City to Jacksonville. Arrived to the airport and boarded our plane to depart TN at 2:52, we sat on the plane at the gate for almost 2 hrs with no a/c and being told the fuel have was not working on one of the engines so they had to check it manually? First, too much info I needed to know, the pilot also said we need to make sure we have enough fuel to land, why would you say that to scare everyone on the case we do take off? They finally let us off the plane back to the gate area because of the heat. I should have been home by 6:30, I got home at 11pm.

### "overpriced for the poorest service ever"
The organization of Allegiant Air is the worst I have ever seen. Notification of a delayed flight went out way too late. A flight delayed until 3.15 but did not board until 3.45 and no announcement was made. A text msg did go out saying Boarding began at 2.26pm when it was after 3.00pm. There were then 4 flights going out of 2 gates within minutes of each other. No one knew what was going on or what flight was being boarded. I will never fly Allegiant again. Paid over $300 for a disaster of a travel day. Ridiculously overpriced for the poorest service ever!

### "Don't say I didn't warn you"
Las Vegas to Fargo. I will never fly with Allegiant Air again. The way this airline does business is deceiving and they knowingly try to take advantage over their customers with add on nickle and dime fees, and poor customer service. I booked my flight for me and my family 2 months in advance. At that time we had 1 checked bag and 1 overhead carry on. We ended up needing 2 checked bags and no longer had use for the 1 overhead carry on. I tried to remove this carry on via their website and app but they don't allow you to do it. You can add bags no problem, but if you want to remove a bag they literally will not let you! I asked the customer service agent at the airport if they could remove the $43.00 bag charge as they could plainly see we did not have an overhead carry on with us. They told me no. I had to call their 1-800 number in order to get reimbursed. On our way back home I actually asked another customer service agent again if they could help be take off the bag and they told me the same thing: call the 1-800 number. The flight was actually pleasant and the everyone was friendly on-board. A few hours after I got home from the return flight I called the 1-800 number. I was literally on hold for 1 hr and 25 minutes. I finally spoke with Kelly and told her what happened. She placed me on a brief hold and this is what she came back with: "after speaking with my manager we can offer you a $43.00 voucher. I told her I did not want a voucher for a bag I never brought on your airplane after notifying both customer service people at the airports. Her response was: "since the customer service agent at the airport didn't make a notation on the computer system we can only offer you the voucher". I told her my situation again, assuring her I did not bring on the overhead bag and that I notified both customer service people at the airport that I was not bringing a carry on bag onto the airplane. You would think the right thing to do would be to refund me $43.00 to keep the customer happy and move on? Do they think I'm lying and trying to sneak on a carry on bag for free to save $43.00 when I spent over $1,200 total on this trip? It makes no sense once so ever. I asked to speak with her manager directly and she would not let me. I asked her if $43.00 was worth losing a family of 4 for life? Her response was: "Since we do not have proof you didn't bring the bag on the airplane we can only offer you a voucher" So, because Allegiant makes it impossible to remove a bag once it is added and because you do not have the option to take this bag off either online or at the actual airport before your flight, they basically swindle you into yet another "hidden charge". I told her to keep the voucher and that me and my family will never be flying with this joke of an airline ever again. If you book a flight with Allegiant buyer be ware. It is not if, but WHEN you will be sucked in a nightmare of a situation either with fees, delays, customers service, you name it. Don't say I didn't warn you.

### "stranded in an airport"
Louisville to Savannah. After being nickled, dimed, and even pennied (which could have been over looked due to the price) I was then stranded in an airport for 7 hours due to a delay. The long delay was a result of maintenance on the plane, not weather. This could have been easily prevented and or fixed by sending another plane after the 3 hour delay announcement. My flight which was scheduled to take off at 2:30 is now taking off at 9:30 for a 1.45 hour flight. At this point it would have been faster to drive the 9 hours home. They did however provide a voucher for a discount on a flight and a refreshment. The crew has been as accommodating as possible but I will not be redeeming my voucher in off chance this happens again.

### "customer service is rude"
Grand Rapids to Sanford Orlando. Horrible experience, the customer service is rude. My brand new luggage was completely ruined. And all the said they could do for me was give me a $25 check which would be sent in the mail. Waited over 2hours to speak to a supervisor who was rude. I will never be flying with this airline again.

### "5 hours for a 2 hour flight"
We were trapped in the plane for 5 hours for a 2 hour flight from Wichita to Phoenix. They had a discrepancy on the headcount with one more person on board than was supposed to be. After the whole crew and a ground personnel counted multiple times, they brought the passenger manifest and verified and again were 1 off. Then they verified by boarding passes and still had the problem. About 15 minutes later when we had waited for almost 2 hours. They decided that it was a bag that they had been mistaking for a person. They pulled away from the gate and sat for 15 more minutes. We started taxing and then they stopped again for about 10 minutes. They decided that they did not have enough fuel, so we went back to the gate for more fuel. Finally, after almost 3 hours, we got to take off. No free drinks, no snacks, just a nervous apology. I know why they were off by one person, but they never figured it out. We could have had someone with bad intent get on the flight and they just called the extra person a (bag).

### "The worst experience"
Las Vegas to Des Moines. The worst experience with this company ever. All the way from customer service to gate agents. Two flights cancelled on the front end and back end while at the airport due to maintenance of planes. Do you not know before hand when plans need to have scheduled maintenance? However they do feel they fairly compensate you with an $8 food voucher and put you in a undesirable hotel. You ever try to buy a meal at an airport for $8? Not to mention the travel vouchers you receive when they cancel your flight is insane for all the hardship they cause. Please just post a standard way of how you compensation/vouchers online so you can be consistent. A flyer on our same flights received double our voucher.

### "worst experience ever"
Cincinnati Ft Lauderdale. This was single worst experience ever. First we were all on plane door closed safety speech was given and then they asked us to exit the plane for mechanical issues. They kept us waiting around for 3.5 hours before canceling flight by this time there were no more flights available to get to Ft Lauderdale. The gate agents left because they had no answers and hid, as matter of fact 4 agents quit on the spot. This airline doesn't give hotel and ground transportation vouchers instead they give you an Amex rewards card that is supposed to have $300 on the card, but of course mine had zero. So I had to pay for Uber and Hotel out of my pocket. Now onto the next morning for my rescheduled flight at 8:00 AM out of CVG to Ft Lauderdale. I get to the gate at 7:10 the monitor says on time and boarding to begin in 10 minutes, problem no plane. Then at 8:00 AM gate agent tells us flight delayed mechanical issues she will update us every 30 minutes. So I call customer service wait 25 minutes for someone to answer, he tells me they are getting new plane, be taking off at 10:00 AM. Then gate agent tells me new plane has mechanical issues and no time is set for take off. The gate agent then goes and hides and nobody at gate to answer questions. They put out Soda and Ice. Well I spot a stack of meal vouchers and I find the one with my name on it and give to a women who is hungry and she uses the $8.00 voucher for some food. Another woman asks the gate agent who appears after 90 minutes and the agent looks woman in the face and lies, says we have no such vouchers. Well finally at 12:30 flight takes off and we get back to Ft Lauderdale. Where I now have to pay $30 extra for parking and $50 extra for boarding my dog and $250 extra for a Nurses aide to help my mom because I could not be there. Now let's talk about customer service and the $300 I am supposed to have to help offset these extra expenses. I have spoken to 7 or 8 agents, supervisors etc. They tell me it is Amex's fault I don't have the money, please wait 36 hours from time we got card to check for funds, well 36 hours came and went still ZERO on the card. I call Amex as told to do by customer service supervisor and Amex whom I never had a problem with in 33 years of membership and they explain that it is on the airline. So I call back and now management at customer service now is not available. In closing If this airline was only option to go somewhere I just wouldn't go. By far worst experience ever and I was just going home.

### "don't book Allegiant Air"
Cincinnati to Orlando. I wish I had better words for how awful this experience was for us. We checked in at the terminal desk over an hour before our flight was to leave, but when we got to the terminal 30 minutes before the flight was to leave it was closed up. Not a person on duty. Not an attendant. Doors locked. We watched them load up the luggage in the plane, watched them pull vans up, then pull away. Watched them finally pull the equipment away from the wheels and then pull the extendable gate back so they could take off. 30 minutes of complete powerlessness. We stayed on the our phones and even sent a support email trying to get through to customer service the entire time hoping we could get through to someone. Delta saved our butts and got us to Orlando in time to catch our cruise sailing out in those few hours. But wait. There's more. When we get back from our cruise and go to check in for our return flight they cancelled our return flight. No emails. No calls. And they tell us at the gate we can pay for another ticket for a flight we had already paid for. Thankfully a gal at Allegiant did refund us for the return flight so that we didn’t pay twice. But still working on resolution for almost missing our cruise. Do your vacation a favor...don't book Allegiant Air.

### "Excuse after excuse"
Not Verified | Sanford to Cedar Rapids. 1:40 flight boarded 25 minutes early only to be left sitting in hot plane for an hour after original depart time. Lightening storm. Then servicing the bathroom for 30 minutes. Excuse after excuse. Would not give a water but the flight attendant stood in front of me with her ice water. Seriously get it together. You may fly to random places so people use you. But this will be our families last. Always always late taking off and rude when you inquire. It’s a sad unprofessional way to operate an airline company. I’ll be cancelling credit card as well. Won’t need to accumulate those points.

### "airline is the worst"
Not Verified | Sanford to Elmira. This is the worst airline and I will never fly them again. Got to the airport 2 hours before my flight, I waited in two different lines for almost 2 hours while Allegiant employees shouted names and flights. There is no intercom. Customer service is rude and argues with you. I missed my flight than was charged $150 change fee, waited 7 hours in the airport, missed my rental car, and had to fly to another city 4 hours away! This airline is the worst in all aspects!

### "Never fly this airline"
Not Verified |  I put my children and grandmother on flight 1109 leaving from Harrisburg pa to Myrtle Beach SC to meet my mother. They were scheduled to take off at 9:15, so we arrived two hours early. When we left our house(an hour away) the flight was still listed as on time. 15 minutes before arriving to the airport I looked it up and saw it was delayed until 11:20. When we arrived, no Allegiant employees were at the check in counter and we were informed by a skycap that they won’t arrive to answer questions until 2 hours before flight time. So with the delay we had 2 hours to wait until an employee could answer any of our questions. Imagine sitting in an airport with two young children excited to go to the beach. 9:00 rolls around, the employees offer no explanation as to the delay, we check our bags and head to security the TSA agents put my children and grandmother through, and as they were walking through the metal detectors an agent mentioned that since their flight was delayed to 11:45 (mind you the last update we received and was posted was 11:20) they may not get to take off by midnight and if they can’t be in the air by midnight the flight would be cancelled. So I’ve sat right outside of security since 9PM (now 11:33 and the incoming is just landing) waiting to hear if the flight will take off. Only problem is? There are no longer any TSA agents at security, and all of Allegiant employees have left for the day. How am I supposed to feel safe knowing my children and grandmother are on this flight? Especially when no employees are here to answer any questions or offer any explanations to delays. To top it off the skycap that greeted us at our original arrival shrugged his shoulders and said “its Allegiant that’s what they do, they delay flights for no reason with no explanation” Never fly this airline.

### "Terrible experiences"
Very bad customer service. 8 hours before my flight I find out that my flight got cancelled. I was supposed to leave 8am Thursday morning and found out late Wednesday night that my flight had been cancelled with no explanation or warning. I took off many days of work for this trip to happen and now I am unable to do the full trip. I am losing out on money that I could have made at work and losing money on my flight. The $150 voucher compensation is not enough to make up for this awful mistake. All that voucher does is encourage you to come back and spend more money on their flights, which may or may not even happen. I cannot trust Allegiant Air anymore. Just about every time I fly with them my flight either gets cancelled or pushed way back. I would encourage everyone to stay far away from this airline. Terrible experiences.

### "didn't have a moments trouble"
First time flying Allegiant Air from New Orleans to Pittsburgh. Was pretty skeptical at first reading all the bad reviews but I didn't have a moments trouble and will definitely be flying with them again soon.

### "No more Allegiant for me"
This is now the 4th time my flight to Memphis has been delayed because of a ‘mechanical’ problem. The South Terminal in Austin is not a fun place to be stuck for several hours. The staff seem excited to update us every 25 minutes that there is no scheduled departure. Even though the boarding pass and screen times were ambitiously set, but different. No more Allegiant for me.

### "What is going on?"
Oakland to Kalispell. Late flight due to continuous different issues. First, apparently there was a medical issue. Then a paperwork issue. Then more paperwork issues. Then, more paperwork issues. We are still sitting here, full plane, crying babies and all and no movement. Is the staff incompetent? What is going on?

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service. Every time I have flown out of San Diego on Allegiant Air has been frustrating. I’ve flown with the same carryone bag for the past 5 years, have flown on Alaska, Delta, Southwest and Alligiant with the bag and never had any issue with putting it under my seat. Today as I am getting on the plane I’m told my bag is to big and I must pay for an overhead bin spot. I flew down from Bellingham the week before on the same aircraft and no issues. Same thing happened with my wife and we were slapped with $100 fee to take our bags on the plane even though 6 days prior we had flown with no issue. Customer service at the San Diego airport is non-existent. Last year I was flying with my 1 year old son and was not allowed to board because I did not have photo ID for him. I had flown down From Washington 2 days ago with no issue but was not allowed to board in San Diego to go home because no photo ID of my 12 month old boy. I wish there were some way to actually solicit change with Alligiants service, however they are making a killing profit wise so why change.

### "do not recommend"
Not Verified |  Las Vegas to Austin. Flights out of Austin are out of a terminal 30min away from the main airport no notice given. One day into trip got notice of flight being cancelled for return trip. Allegiant will not work with other airlines to re route our return flight. Have to pay $500 to get a flight home out of pocket. Miss a day of work. Allegiant will only refund the cost for the return flight. Will never fly again. Highly do not recommend, they will leave you stranded and stressed out on your vacation.

### "never fly with them again"
I will never fly with them again. They canceled my flight 48 hours prior to take off. They gave me 100 additional dollars to make a last minute flight. It is impossible to make a last minute flight for $300 total. I should not have been so cheap and went with a reputable airline instead. In the long run using this "bargain"airline cost me more. If you are on a strict schedule go with a better airline.

### "most uncomfortable seats"
Not Verified |  Fort Lauderdale to Concord. Most uncomfortable seats ever. This plane appears to have been bought from a developing country that was fitted with city bus seats. Right now I’m returning and the flight is 4 hours late. Worst airline I have ever flown.

### "Worst airline ever"
I am so disappointed with Allegiant and will never book with them again. Coming to FLL our plane was delayed two times and now going back to Concord its delayed again twice. Why even have a time to come or go back? It wasn't because of the weather neither trip. The weather has been nice in both states. I think the fact airline does not think about people having other things to do and places to go. Worst airline ever, greatly disappointed.

### "This was ridiculous"
Not Verified |  My issue doesn’t really stem from the travel itself, but rather the customer support. My saga began when I received an in-app notification to check-in for my flight. I began the check-in process and planned to change my seat assignment (I was traveling with my 11 month old son and thought it would be best for everyone if I reserved a window seat). I was more than willing to pay $25 for this “upgrade”. So I selected my new seat, but there was an issue with the check out process (not sure what). I tried again, I tried a third time with a different card (perhaps they didn’t like that I used my Delta Airlines Amex to pay for my upgrade). Still can’t check-in, I switched to my laptop and tried a fourth time, now the website said “you’ve tried checking-in and we can’t process this”. What! So I send off a contact us request (the automated email response said they would get back to me in 7 days!). As I am flying the next day I call the number provided (not a 1-800 number, so I have to run up my sister’s long distance bill). Now, here is where it gets frustrating, I get a busy signal, for an hour I try calling back, each time I get a busy signal. Finally, it rings through, at which point I spend an hour and a half on hold before my issue is resolved. This was ridiculous, I wasted the last day I had with my family to take care of this issue. I’m so upset and frustrated with the whole process, the discount price is not worth this chaos!

### "a terrible experience"
Not Verified |  Punta Gorda to Cleveland. Delayed 2 hours on each leg with only 24 hours notice. When complaint was filed they said you had 24 hours to make other arrangements. Well there were no other Allegient flights, they gave no rationale about the delay, they just gave the “coined” platitudes and moved on. Uncaring, terrible customer service, just a terrible experience. Will never fly with them again.

### "delayed for 6 hours"
Bellingham to Las Vegas. Keep in mind while reading this that Allegiant and Alaska Air were the only airlines at this airport so my choices were nil. After turning in our rental car we proceeded to ticketing/check-in only to be told that our flight was delayed for 6 hours (1:26 am). They asked if I received an email (obviously I did not) and I replied no then she said it's because we went through a 3rd party booking agent and that was the only email address they had. Now if they would have contacted my agent, they would have emailed me and made arrangements accordingly but as it was I missed my connecting flight in Las Vegas and was in their airport for over 12 hours trying to get a flight home. I lost 2 days of work and an additional $1100.00 for airline tickets. Allegiant was gracious enough (I state sarcastically) to give us each an $8.00 voucher that expired at midnight. And I never received the $50 voucher by email that they were going to send immediately. If you have to use them then by all means please have a back-up plan. But if you don't have to then I suggest you find another.

### "they are unreliable"
Not Verified |  St. Pete/Clearwater to Greensboro. After 6 hours of constant incremental delays of 1 hour each and 2 gate changes, my patience was exhausted. My daughter expected to meet me at the Greensboro airport around 8 PM. Now, if they weren't lying again and a plane was actually going to show up, my daughter was looking at having to meet me at the Greensboro airport at 1:20 AM. I had enough. I asked the gate agent if I could cancel my flight and get a full refund. She assured me that I could and quoted me the exact price that I paid and told me the refund took about 2 business days to get back in my account. I cancelled the flight and left the airport because Allegiant could not live up to their advertising hype. The full refund was also a lie. After sitting in the airport for 6 hours and being "compensated" with a couple of slices of cold, stale pizza and a soft drink, Allegiant emailed me a voucher for $50.00. The flight did get to Greensboro eventually, but there appeared to be one more delay and the arrival time in Greensboro was 2:30 AM. As far as I am concerned, I will never fly Allegiant again. The CEO can take my voucher and stick it. I found a major airline that flies from Tampa to Charlotte for $3.00 less. It's a 1 hour drive for my daughter to Charlotte, but they don't have 7 hour delays. Based on Allegiant's interminable delays, I could have driven in only 5 hours more time at a lot less cost Allegiant continually highlights the difference between being transported and being shipped. Do not fly Allegiant. They are unreliable and customer service means nothing to them.

### "thanks for poor service"
Not Verified |  St. Petersburg to Norfolk. It's ok to delay a week or so prior to flight. Not ok to do several times the day before and on the date of flight. It's a huge inconvenience for the people flying as well as people picking passengers up. There were no weather issues and they don't have any explanation as to why. The 2nd time I've had issues with allegiant. When flying in January VA had a snow storm the airport reported closed that am. Allegiant still had it as the flight was still on time and flying it. Allegiant waited to an hour before the flight was set to take off to send notification the flight was cancelled. The airport was an hour away and a huge inconvenience. You can forget calling because the wait was an hour hold. This time I had issues with delays the kept making again, called in and waited 30+ minutes to get someone. Asked to speak to a supervisor 8 times the rep refused and was down right rude. Didn't see why I had an issue and suggested I cancel my flight all together. I was on the phone over an hour and still never got a supervisor and still didn't get checked in my flight. No kind of accommodation or willingness to assist. And you guys damaged my suit case! Thanks for poor service Allegiant.

### "no text message about delay"
Not Verified |  Ft Lauderdale to Indianapolis. Congratulations Allegiant for being the worst airline in history. Major delays both to our destination and back. The return home took the cake. Our 2:15 flight was delayed until 4:30 with no text message about this delay, and they also acted like this was the normal flight time and not a delay. We had no internet while we were on vacation, so we could not check email about delays. Then the Allegiant attendent said we couldn't check our bags in for another 3 hours. Then we asked where their was a place for us to eat where we didn't have to go through security, and she said it was around the corner. That 'around the corner' was a mile and half walk schlepping our luggage along to find a restaurant. We were also told there was no shuttle to that restaurant, but there was. Took the shuttle back to find that there had been restaurants downstairs in baggage claim. We didn't even have to go that mile and half. Finally check in takes place, and the attendant says that she has to charge us 25 dollars for printing out our boarding passes. This did not occur when we took our flight going to our destination. Also, when we took our flight to our destination, the Allegiant attendant weighed all our bags together to get a total weight for overage. We did not go over at that time. Coming back, we did not have any additional weight in our bags, but the attendant couldn't add the bag weights together to get a total. Apparently she flunked math in school. So another 50.00 was charged. This is addition to not being able to pick our pets up in time and getting charged another night at the kennel. You also cannot reach a human on their phone. Nice dodge Allegiant.

### "never fly Allegiant again"
Not Verified |  Tulsa to Tampa. I have flown this trip to Florida 6 times now. 8 out of 10 of my flights were delayed. Today we was notified of a 2 hour delay but as we were going through security we were told another 6.5 hour delay. So after being dropped off at airport we are stuck here for 6.5 hours. They give me a $50 voucher good for next flight only. We will never fly Allegiant again.

### "delayed both leaving and returning"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Indianapolis. This is our first flight with this airline. We were delayed both leaving and returning by 3 hours each time. Delay notifications weren’t sent out until already at the airport. Do not use this airline unless you plan for delays in your travel details. I would like to have some of my money back but that won’t happen because they rip people off. I will never use this airline ever again.

### "invent new ways to create delays"
❌ Not Verified |  Our flight to Sanford was delayed around 5 hours because our original aircraft was deemed “non-operational” after it landed (which is worrisome itself) and another aircraft from Memphis had to come pick us up. Our flight back to Bentonville was delayed nearly 2.5 hours because they “needed to collect all necessary signatures to complete their paperwork”. It’s like they invent new ways to create delays. When you factor in all the fees, cost of food/drinks, etc this airline is only minimally cheaper than other, more reliable airlines. And depending on how much you value being on time and keeping your schedule (many travelers on our Sanford flight had reservations at DisneyWorld which were missed due to the delay), it isn’t worth it at all. The flight attendants said each time that the delays weren’t typical, which I find hard to believe since nearly all Allegiant flights at both airports had “delayed” next to them on the arrivals/departures screens. The fact that it is a direct flight is great, but unless your trip has a few days of flexibility at the beginning and end of it to allow for similar delays, I’d recommend using another airline.

### "Absolutely horrible airline"
❌ Not Verified |  St Petersburg to Ft Wayne. Absolutely horrible airline. Was sent from one ticket counter to another trying to check-in. We went all the way through security only to get to the wrong set of gates and was told to exit and go back through the original security check point were we started. Barely made it through security in time to get on the plane, didn't even get a chance to eat beforehand, and were at the airport over 1.5 hours ahead of time for a domestic flight. Absolute trash.

### "had to pay an additional $260"
❌ Not Verified |  Austin to Orlando. Booked a flight towards the end of June to see my father who was in hospice, but his condition suddenly took a turn for the worse and so three days after I made the reservation I had to rebook so I could fly out to see him before he died. I called the airline hoping they might rebook me with some kind of discount considering the circumstances, since I was already really stretching my budget with the original booking. Was told they didn't make any exceptions for "bereavement" and had to pay an additional $260 on top of my original fare. Looking online, that policy is hidden so deeply in their fine print you wouldn't even know about it unless you thought to look it up beforehand. So, now on top of my dad's death, I get to enjoy being short on bills.

### "Over 10 hour delay"
❌ Not Verified |  Columbus to Orlando. Over 10 hour delay (pushed out 3 times) without explanation. Not weather related, “operational” was all that was shared by customer service after a 45 min wait on the phone. Very frustrating, spend a little more and fly an airline that’s more reliable. It’s worth it!

### "It’s not worth the discount"
Knoxville to Baltimore. Flight delayed 2.5 hours while sitting on the runway. First a delay, followed by a delay, followed by more delays every 30-45 minutes. Finally they let us off the plane back into the airport. Then another 1/2 hour delay then back on the airplane. The return fight was Cancelled completely after 3 more delays. Save your time. It’s not worth the discount.

### "delayed over 6 hours"
Louisville to Sanford. Save time and money and don’t bother with Allegiant. My flight has so far been delayed over 6 hours. Absolutely no ground service to take complaints and questions and no certain answers as to whether or not our plane will actually arrive on time. No compensation has been given for the well over 150 angsty passengers sitting in the terminal. Don’t fly Allegiant. It’s a nightmare.

### "worst experience ever"
Rochester to Sanford. Flying with Allegiant has to have been the worst experience ever. On my way to Florida my flight was supposed to depart at 10:30 am but I we didn’t board until almost an hour later and didn’t take off until around 12:30pm. On our way back we almost missed our flight because we were held up for over an hour trying to figure out why we had to pay for our baggage a second time and then we found out that one of the staff mixed up our reservation and added one bag to the wrong reservation. Long story not so short is basically I’ll never fly with them ever again.

### "never be flying them again"
Cincinnati to Myrtle Beach. My family and I chose Allegiant air solely based on price, and I can say without hesitation that I will never be flying with them again. First flight was not only delayed an hour and a half, but once we boarded a safety issue was discovered which took another hour to resolve. Flight home was delayed 3 hours and then to top it off we had to switch planes due to a safety issue with the first. No amount of money saved will ever make this experience worth it. Spend the extra money for peace of mind. The only reason I gave 1/10 is because they gave us a complimentary snack for our troubles.

### "Never again will I use them"
❌ Not Verified |  San Antonio to Las Vegas. This was the very first time I traveled with Allegiant Air. Never again will I use them. My flight was supposed to leave at 1:30 p.m. and I did not get out on my flight till 10pm - 11:30 p.m. I did not arrive at my destination till 1 AM. That was a 10 hour delay flight from me. All they told me was it was going to be delayed for a few minutes due to maintenance. After a few minutes then delayed again and delayed again. They never said the main reason. I felt like they were giving excuses after excuses. They did give me two food vouchers and a $100 voucher for my next flight. Which I don't think it's enough for what this Airline took away from me that day. I had reservations at a certain times, I could have gone to work and I missed a whole days of work. I had plans and Allegiant ruined it all. And the flight returning back home was 2 hours delayed, not too bad, if i compare it to my 10 hour delayed from days prior, but still delayed. If anyone plans on traveling with Allegiant Air make sure to take a sweater or blanket. You may be there longer than expected.again.

### "Hungry. Tired. Disgusted"
St. Petersburg to Hagerstown return was a disaster as both legs were over 3 hours delayed and put us in MD and FL, respectively in the wee hours of the morning. The outbound was said to be due to "mechanical" problems. The return gave us no reason. So we waited in Hagerstown airport from 3pm until 12:30 am with no food available and the constant loud din of TSA warnings every 45 seconds for 6 hours. The seats were hard, the Avis rental car agent had gone home for the night. Misery! Hungry. Tired. Disgusted. Never agin will we fly on this airline. We are 80 years old and the discomfort, the danger of driving to our hotel/home at 3 a.m. in the rain is something never want to do again.v

### "was the worst experience"
❌ Not Verified |  This was my first time flying with this airline and it was the worst experience I have ever encountered with an airline. I absolutely do not like flying Spirit Airlines but I would choose them any day over Allegiant. I was out of town on personal business and the communication from this airline is unprofessional, bootleg, rude and inconsiderate. My flight was to leave out on May 20th heading to Fort Lauderdale and I was given no notice until after 30 minutes of me standing in line. The airline didn't even bother to notify me before my flight, i learned from other passengers. Then they were attempting to place all of these passengers on an already booked flight with no compensation for the troubles. I had to pay $400.00 to catch a flight out of North Carolina with another airline. The customer service suck, the communication suck and this company sucks.

### "our flight gets canceled"
Orlando to Puerto Rico. This airline ruined out honeymoon. When I purchased these tickets everyone told me and warned me about Allegiant but I figured I would find out myself - unfortunately they were right. The Stanford Orlando airport staff lack of any leadership they do whatever they want and treat customers terribly. We were yelled at told to wait and wait wait until finally our flight gets canceled and no other ones left to PR same day. I had to purchase all brand new tickets with American Airlines go make it back home. Worst part about it is they wouldn’t refund all my money back.

### "Horrendous customer service"
Checked in the front and Our gate was c4. Security was loud and backed up. Evidently while we were in security, our gate changed to c6. Boarding ended at 10:11am and we ran to the gate and arrived at 10:12pm only the be refused entry onto the plane because everyone was boarded. This was a flight for work. I've never been denied a flight when a minute late especially when the gate was changed by the airline at the last minute. I had to buy a ticket with another airline today because of 1 minute. I'm disgusted! Horrendous customer service. First and last time with this airline.

### "made flight very uncomfortable"
Las Vegas to Oakland. My family of 4 people including 2y.o. baby flew from Oakland and didn’t have any problem with car seat, but in Las Vegas they decided it’s too big. We also had checked in one suitcase exactly 40 lb. The weight and size was absolutely the same as in Oakland. Yes, it was little baby pillow and 6 extra diapers inside, what is weight no more then 1 lb. So I had to move diapers to my purse and pillow we were carrying in hands. A front of the whole line of checking in crowd this scandal was stupid! Did it change total weight of our stuff on the plane? No!!! They just made our flight very uncomfortable and destroyed our mood on the way home and aftertaste of our vacation. On a top of this, check in employee made a mark on our printed tickets to make extra search before boarding on plane in baby stroller, so we waste extra time and stopped the crowd for boarding. And nothing was in stroller! How stupid revenge she did! And one more on a top of this: flight was delay 50 minutes. And in Las Vegas they made us to run between gates: at first it was gate 11, then 8, and finally 4. What a comfortable and friendly Allegiant! Thank God flight attendants were super nice, and to relieve our stress we bought wine and snacks. And this is the last time we spend money with Allegiant, goodbye !

### "kicked off our flight"
Las Vegas to Springfield. Worst airline. Never fly with them. We were kicked off our flight for no reason. Was told couldn't have a new one for 2 days and they will not pay for the hotel or anything. I am a young adult on a budget and I am not able to afford to nights in a hotel in Vegas not expecting it. The staff were extremely rude and when we were kicked off they told us they would get our bag and call over the intercom where it was. When we waited an hour to hear we went and found out that the didn't get it off the plane. So we are stuck for 2 days with absolutely nothing. Worst experience of my life. I will never fly with this airline again.

### "friendly and professional"
After watching the 60 Minutes investigation and reading some not so favorable reviews, I had a lot of aniexty about flying Allegiant. However, my husband had already purchased the tickets. I am very happy to say our experience with Allegiant was great! Both to Vegas and back to Belleville, we were on new planes. The flights were smooth and on time. Also, the pilots and flight attendants were friendly and professional. I will definitely fly Allegiant again!

### "crammed in the middle seat"
Cincinnati to Ft Lauderdale. False advertising, paid tons more fore first class when in fact most of the seats, with exception of emergency exit rows were exactly identically small and cramped. My husband who is handicapped, was crammed in the middle seat with his knees pressed into the seat in front of him. The flight attendants were nice, but young and immature in their behavior. We spoke with someone at the Allegiant counter when we landed in Fort Lauderdale and that representative told us that Allegiant falsely labels seats as first class when they are not. She told us that is the biggest complaint she receives but she can't do anything about it. We will not use Allegiant ever again.

### "be treated with respect"
St Pete to Belleville. We had to change our flight on Allegiant Air. We paid for seats and priority boarding. When we had to switch dates we were promised by customer service agent that we had all of the things and seats we had previously paid for. Our seats were changed and our priority boarding was not on our boarding pass. I went to gate agent at gate and tried to explain what happened but he would not listen to anything I was trying to explain. We paid for service that was changed when flight was changed. A different gate agent listened to what we had to say and in fact verified what we had paid for previously. All we wanted was what we paid for and to be listened to and treated with respect.

### "delayed twice with no explanation"
This airline seems to always have issues and I’ve given them multiple chances. The first time I flew with them from Hilton Head to Columbus, they accidentally sent my belongings to Seattle. I understand mistakes happen but they didn’t reimburse me for the items I had to go re-purchase nor offer any kind of apology or incentive. Another incident, my husband and I got married in Hilton Head last year and my aunt and uncle and 2 friends were on the same flight from Columbus to Hilton Head and their flight was continuously getting delayed all day and then canceled due to technical difficulties. They were told that they would fly in a separate plane and leave the next day. The flight was then delayed again all day and they finally left that evening. They had missed 2 whole days of their vacation and Allegiant offered to pay for those 2 days they missed at their condo however, when it came down to it, my aunt kept reaching out and never heard back to get reimbursed. My most recent flight with them from Fort Lauderdale to Columbus was my final straw with the airline. We were heading back home after a cruise and our flight was scheduled for 3.20pm. We had to be off the cruise ship by 8.15 so we got to the airport fairly early. We were expecting to be able to check in and get through security to be able to eat breakfast and lunch to occupy our time. They wouldn’t let us check in until 12.51pm because we were checking bags. So we sat at the airport with 7 of us and all of our luggage for 5 hours with no access to food or shops with snacks, etc. The girls at the check in desk didn’t apologize for the inconvenience or explain why they wouldn’t let us back. Instead, they chuckled. We then finally got to check in and our flight was delayed twice with no explanation. Finally, we get on the plane and sat for an hour and a half before taking off. The whole time we sat there, there was a continuous loud beeping noise the whole hour and a half sitting waiting to take off. We then take off and they offer us complimentary water for the inconvenience. Needless to say, this airline is a joke, their employees are extremely rude, and we will never fly with them again. I would rather spend more money with a reliable company than with this joke of a company.

### "missed the first leg of my flight"
Pittsburgh to Orlando. I had to pay an extra 105 for my return ticket because I missed the first leg of my flight out. They claimed I was a no show even though I was at their ticket counter explaining why I missed my flight and trying to get on another one. I paid the 105 so I could get home just to find out that it was delayed 2 hours, then 4 hours, then 5, and ended up not leaving till 1:30 in the morning, 7.5 hours later than the original flight was scheduled. We arrived to an empty airport at 4 in the morning. They’ve refused to refund the extra money for a seat I had already paid for claiming it was a courtesy that I even got on the flight. They issued everyone a 50 dollar voucher for the flight delay. I highly doubt most of those people, me included, will ever fly this airline again.

### "cancelling the flight"
Bismarck to Las Vegas. Scheduled to leave at 1.25 pm and they are cancelling the flight. Allegiant  claims the wind is too strong for them to land here in Bismarck - every other plane scheduled is on time and landing and taking off. So now we must sit here in the airport until 11.15 tonight when they can get another airplane in here. Allegiant is doing nothing to accommodate customers. They simply don’t give a dam. I called customer service and they said there is nothing they can do. Why don’t you try being honest and tell your customers the real reason you cancelled this flight.

### "$5 person to get our boarding pass"
Myrtle Beach to Pittsburgh. Not happy at all. Big plane 35 people would not let us move seats very rude people. When we asked to move they said yes but would charge our credit card. Charged us $5 person to get our boarding pass! Never again would we use this airline.

### "lost my entire flight fee"
Orlando to Rochester. I had to cancel the flight. I was unable to contact Allegiant during the required time frame and lost my entire flight fee. They were not answering customer service numbers at area code 702 and email responses take 7 days. Then I found out something worse! I had made my car reservation through Allegiant, cancelled directly with Enterprise in Rochester NY but this is known as third party booking. I could not get a refund from Enterprise because they did not collect the funds. Allegiant does not give any refunds for any reason, including car rentals and hotels which are done when booking your flight on the Allegiant site.

### "little communication from anyone"
Flight #1857 from PIE to IND was supposed to depart at 4:27pm on March 16th, 2018. The first notification of delay came at 11:20am saying that the flight was delayed until 5:40pm. The second notification of delay came at 1:08pm saying that the flight was delayed until 7:00pm. The third notification of delay came at 5:04pm saying that the flight was delayed until 11:45pm. The fourth notification of delay came at 7:57pm saying that the flight was delayed until 12:45am. The aircraft did not arrive in PIE until 2:00am. The flight did not leave until about 3:00am on March 17th, 2018. We finally arrived at IND around 5:00am, but could not get off the plane until 5:30am because the crew at IND was not ready for us. We arrived 11 hours late. The crew at PIE said they were giving out meal vouchers to everyone on the plane, which is fine except the only thing available to eat at PIE includes: a small coffee shop, a limited bar, and a gift shop, which all closed around 8pm. Realizing their mistake, the crew at PIE orders pizza for the passengers. They did not account for people which dietary restrictions, like myself. I could not eat the pizza, otherwise I would get severely sick. So I sat in the PIE airport/airplane for about 11 hours, only having water. I was physically ill once I arrived in IND because I had no access to food for such a long period of time. I would've purchased some snacks on the plane, except the flight attendants did not serve everyone. I was one of those individuals that was not served. One would think that after 11 hours of delay, someone, just one person, would show some kind of customer service, but nope. I did not eat for 12.5 hours that day, because I did not have access to food, even on the airplane. One might ask, "Why didn't you just leave the airport and go buy something at a restaurant? and then answer is "because we physically could not leave. TSA closed around 12:30am. Nobody could leave or enter the airport. Nobody. We were legitimately trapped inside the gate area. The option to cancel my flight or reschedule the flight was given. Except once you cancelled or rescheduled your flight, you couldn't leave the airport. You were still trapped inside the airport with those waiting for the aircraft to arrive. I was faced with two options in reality: 1) Wait for the plane to finally show up at 2am, with the possibility of it being cancelled (as explained in the next paragraph), or 2) Cancel/Reschedule my flight, but not being able to leave the airport until TSA opened the next morning so that they can open the exit doors. That would have left me in the airport, which i was told, until 5am. Physically being trapped in the airport, I decided to stick it out because at least I would be out of PIE by 5am. There was very little communication from anyone from Allegiant. I called customer service on 3/16/18 to ask why the flight was so delayed and what they were going to do for us, the passengers. After 58 minutes of being on hold, the agent raised her voice at me 3 times. She said something along the lines of "if the plane arrives at PIE at around midnight, they could cancel the flight. That is not something people that have already been waiting 8 hours want to hear.

### "delayed by 8 hours"
Elmira to Orlando. Do not fly them. We were delayed by 8 hours and I’m writing this sitting from the airport possibly awaiting even more delay. This airline is notorious for having terrible aircraft therefore constantly making unwanted emergency stops (why our plane isn’t here) and then delaying everyone. If you only have a few hours delay with other airlines consider yourself lucky and avoid this budget airline which is a total joke. Save yourself. And I’m one for traveling budget airlines and do often but this was my first and last time ever flying Allegiant. Not worth saving $100 which you end up spending on baggage water and all the food you have To buy while waiting for the delayed flight. Also this would have gotten 0 stars if that was an option.

### "couldn't care less"
Fort Lauderdale to Norfolk. My flight was canceled because they said a bird destroyed the engine beyond repair. Never heard about that by anyone else at the front desk nor on the news. They didn't accommodate anyone even those people who had connecting flights. They said they would book you on a flight much later in the evening the next day. Full refund if you wanted that. I had to book with United and the cost was more 1 way then my round trip with Allegiant. They couldn't care less about anyone else but themselves. They should give a voucher for another trip plus a full refund. Look at all the money and business they lost over this.

### "Most uncomfortable seats ever"
Milwaukee to Ft Lauderdale. First and last time I will fly this airline. Most uncomfortable seats ever. Not even a seat back pocket. Hours late. Delays, delays, delays. And nothing but excuses. Rude flight attendants. You get what you pay for. I’ll forgo our return flight and book flights home on another airline.

### "the worst delayed experience"
I flew Allegiant Air from Jacksonville,  yesterday, Sunday, April 15th, 2018 to Indianapolis My flight was schedule at 9:43 am, because of the problem with the aircraft, it was delayed until 8.20 pm in the evening. If I didn't want to fly last night, the next flight would be next Thursday. At the end I left Jacksonville at 9pm and landed in Indianapolis around 10.30 pm. This was the worst delayed experience I had ever encountered, the company gave me 2 $50 voucher to use for the future flight with Allegiant. For sure I will never fly with this carrier again. I hope this company will close down for the way it treated the passengers for the more than 12 hours delayed.

### "by far the worst airline"
Allegiant Air is by far the worst airline I have used! I’m vacationing in Florida from Greenville, SC only to find out that our bag was left in Greenville and not put on the plane! After calling Allegiant Air and being hung up on twice they they tell me that our luggage can’t be sent out til Monday 4/9 and that’s when we are due to return home. They told me they will have someone give me a call to see what could be done for me and here we are 10 hours later and i have yet to hear from Someone.

### "staff, rude, rude, rude"
New Orleans to Raleigh-Durham. I've never flown on a more unprofessional airline in my life. First off I understand charging for checked luggage but going from $20 online to $50 is insane. And then to charge you for printing a boarding pass is crazy. Lets not talk about the staff, rude, rude, rude. Everyone including the flight attendants were rude. No matter how cheap their flights are, flying with them will never happen again.

### "smarter to pay for another airline"
Fort Lauderdale to Belleville. To save your time please do not fly Allegiant if you want to ride an unreliable plane or want to be late by like 10 hours. The flight attendants didn’t tell us anything, also very rude - they refunded us 50$ that we can only use to use to purchase other plane tickets for Allegiant Air, an 8$ meal voucher that didn’t even work and a can of soda. Terrible service and low quality planes. You get what you pay for so it is smarter to pay for another airline.

### "will never fly Allegiant again"
After my husband I tried to sit together in "open" seats, the flight attendant got angry and went up front. Ten minutes later, a female with a McCarran airport sweater, said that if I wanted to stay on board that I couldn't make one peep during the flight. If I so much as made one peep the pilot would turn the plane around and I would be taken off and I would not be given a refund. Do they have the right to do that? After reading a bunch of documents at the FAA website, it seems as though they can only kick you off it they feel you are a safety risk. Then after you are rescreened by TSA and found not to be a risk you are to be rebooked on another flight or allowed to take your original flight if it has not already departed. Nowhere did it say that the airline can just throw you off and abandon you. I was not a safety or security risk and they knew it. I just wrinkled their feathers when I asked them why we couldn't change seats, and also asked for badge information. Their responses for why we couldn't change seats was laughable. Needless to say I will never fly Allegiant again. I am posting this review so that if you are considering taking this airline, you might want to reconsider.

### "costing more than a major airline"
St Pete Clearwater to Austin. You have to pay $60 to put your carryon in the overhead. I thought this would be a time saver on my regular flights to Austin. With the required shuttle ride because Allegiant is not landing at the main terminal it adds an hour to my trip (30 minutes each way). By the time it was all over, the “cheap” flight ended up costing more than a major airline. No beverage service. Rude waitresses.

### "gives no heads up during delays"
Allegiant Air is by far the most classless organization currently in operation. It seems that this airline is run by animals. Every single time I fly with them (forced to fly with this airline as they are the only direct route from South Florida to Asheville) the flight is delayed. This airline gives no heads up during delays, no emails, nothing. It’s particularly upsetting because it seems they have plenty of notice that the incoming flight is delayed, so they should know and have the respect of letting their customers know when they do. This organization lacks class, humanity, respect and culture. I could give a million examples, but I won’t waste any more of my time. The way I see it, you’re better off taking another airline with a connection, because that would most likely leave on time and get you there at the same time Allegiant will, with their massive delays. Never take this airline.

### "rollercoaster communications"
We returned home 8 days ago, final flight with Allegiant Air from St Petersburg / Clearwater to Niagara Falls. Upon arrival, out of 200 passengers, only we had missing luggage. Allegiant clerk quickly advised that somehow one bag went to Orlando but would be immediately re-routed and delivered to Canada. Sure, no problem, Canada customs agent assured us that airlines deliver lost luggage all the time and no problem crossing the border. By Sunday, no bags and started rollercoaster communications with Allegiant and finally was informed that bag was sent via FedEx and was given a tracking number. Great, now we could watch its travels. Tuesday it was resting in Toronto waiting for release from customs. Now began ommunications with FedEx and end result was that we would have to personally arrange customs clearance. Went down to Niagara Falls with documents and was advised that they couldn't do the release there and would have to go to Canada customs at Toronto airport. Called customs in Toronto and very nice man confirmed that was true. Back with FedEx to see if we could arrange a one time power of attorney - nope. So today we did the 120 mile round trip, waved to all the passing cars on the QEW, hwys. 407, 401 and others, toured Toronto airport, became expert at using gps and now arrived home with missing bag. At least it was nice that Allegiant shipped at no charge, and nice customs agent advised that no charge for customs clearance.

### "delays with short notifications"
Belleville to Orlando . Worst company ever unless you don’t mind endless delays with short notifications. Last 10 flights I’ve bought have been delayed and zero support from customer service other than “sorry, deal with it” Prices are cheap but have to pay for everything under the sun from seat selection to carry on bags

### "been thoroughly impressed"
Rickenbacker to Orlando Sanford. This is the 2nd time I've flown Allegiant air and the 2nd time I've been thoroughly impressed. The staff in the airport were great and the flight staff was even better. Flight attendants were amazing, funny and helpful and made the very rough flight enjoyable. They calmed my nerves on the flight.

### "experience with Allegiant was excellent"
Newburgh to Punta Gorda. I always fly JetBlue, but because I was looking for a directl flight near to Venice FL, I chose to try Allegiant. Before my flight I read all the reviews and I was concerned since a lot of the reviews were very bad. I found my experience with Allegiant was excellent. The plane was clean (our return flight was on a brand new plane), the staff was friendly and courteous, and the pilots were professional. You have to pay for everything, but if you plan accordingly that is not a big deal. Buy some water and snacks ahead of time and enjoy your flight. Be aware that there is no WiFi which is a pain, but if you download a movie ahead of time no problem. The seats are very generic and not really that comfortable, but if you bring a cushion (as my wife did) problem solved. I would pay more for WiFi and hope that would be an option in the future.

### "what a great experience"
Orlando to Raleigh. It was my first experience with not only the Sanford airport, but Allegiant Air as well. I wanted to say what a great experience we had, our flight attendant went above and beyond to make sure that we enjoyed our experience. She was very knowledgeable in training us with the exit row duties. It was a rather short flight so she really didn't have to check on us the way she did but we really appreciated her extra kindness.

### "4 couples were split"
My wife and I registered together as 2 people flying from Orlando to Cedar Rapids. Upon reviewing our seats we were given 20A and 20F. At Orlando Airport we asked if we could be seated together, Allegiant counter asked for $22 so we could move to some empty seats. Just not right. We registered as a couple. We waited until we boarded and asked an attendant. Found out the people we were next to were also split. I gave them my seat so they can be together. Upon doing so found out the individual next to my wife was also forced to split from his wife. It turned out 4 couples were split with empty seats on the flight. Happy to say we reversed what Allegiants forced seating practices tried to accomplish.

### "learned my lesson flying with Allegiant"
Flew Omaha to Orlando. I’ve flown with Allegiant over 20 times. Every time I’ve flown, the plane has been at least an hour behind schedule. They don’t check the plane before they put you on board. Allegiant boards everyone on the plane, then checks the plane. Absolutely ridiculous. I’m currently sitting on the plane and it’s been 2 hours because of mechanical problems (like always). A light bulb is out? Are you kidding me? You should have hundreds of those on hand. I’ve learned my lesson flying with Allegiant and that is never again. Please take my word before you decide to save $100 bucks - it’s not worth it.

### "airline is absolutely awful"
Flew Allegiant Air from Orlando to Chattanooga. This airline is absolutely awful no other way to put it. I've been sitting on the runway for a longer duration than my entire flight. All I can say is I will never be flying Allegiant again and I suggest you do the same if you don't want a similar experience.

### "unimpressed with customer service"
Tampa to Asheville. A flight attendant informed me that he would ensure that my bag made it onto the plane and because he failed to do so, my luggage is now lost. As of today it has been lost for a week. When I approached Allegiant team members at the airport about it, they responded all the same and referred me to the customer care service in Las Vegas. I have tried numerous times to call customer service and the wait time varies but is no less than 45 minutes for each call. It didn’t seem to get anywhere when I called, they told me that there wasn’t much they could do. I was forced to buy an entire new wardrobe on my vacation because I had no clothes or shoes (they were in my luggage, the luggage that  Allegiant failed to load onto the plane). I am highly unimpressed with the customer service I have received in regards to Allegiant taking responsibility for losing my luggage and making the effort to contact me in regards to a refund.

### "I couldn’t get any credit"
Los Angeles to Memphis. They are a struggling airline that is not business oriented. I had a 6.30am flight, arrived well before time only to be informed that the gates closed  20-30 mins earlier than it was supposed to. When I asked for assistance I was informed that I would have to call a customer service line to rebook - I waited 45 mins on hold only to be told that I would have to buy another ticket and I couldn’t get any credit. I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone.

### "it was terrible"
Have flown Allegiant several times with no complaints. This time we had a 4 hour delay in Punta Gorda and it was terrible. Everyone was on their phones trying to reach Allegiant Air with no success. I was on hold for 76 minutes and then gave up. We were told at the airport that we would each get a $50 credit for air fare which never happened, I emailed Allegiant and was expecting a reply which also didn’t happen. I had purchased 3 round trip tickets and patiently waiting for my credit.

### "Prices are amazing"
Greenville to Tampa. They were on time for me, fly late night, no issues getting boarded. Join 2018 and use the app for everything. Prices are amazing if you only plan on bringing a carry on. Here is the bad no free meals, no free drink and comfort is a flat 0/10. The seats dont even recline. That said you get what you pay for. If you can deal with having no space and no inflight meal or drinks unless you pay, this company wont bother you.

### "pay for everything separately"
Orlando to Grand Rapids. This airline is certainly not worth the price of admission. They have yet to have a flight on time, always delayed. You pay for everything separately, as you would with Spirit. Will not fly with them again, even if the ticket was $25. Forgot to mention their very limited routes.

### "it’s not worth it"
Flew Allegiant Air from Raleigh to New Orleans. Had to wait an hour and a half for check in to begin. Way too many fees for everything. Too afraid to even use the restroom because there is probably a fee associated with using the toilet paper. Barely had time to get through TSA because the counter doesn’t open until two hours before the flight leaves. Took an hour through TSA. I almost missed my flight because they are lazy and won’t work or allow people to check bags 3 hours before. Come on, you really can’t pay someone an extra hour so we can check in? I will never fly here again. Yes, the ticket was cheaper but by the time you add all the fees and time you’re waiting, it’s not worth it.

### "stress free and pleasant flight."
The flight crew on Allegiant are so friendly. I flew from Montrose to Los Angeles on 2/21/18- flight #361, and  the cabin crew were all very accommodating. They make flying so much more enjoyable. I would definitely recommend Allegiant if you are looking for a stress free and pleasant flight.

### "attendants were wonderful"
Austin to Orlando. The boarding process was clear and smooth. The cost of the flight alone is worth taking a trip. The flight attendants were wonderful, caring and thoughtful. I observed them taking care to assist each passenger who had an issue or concern. They took the time to listen. I find that so important in a society that lacks active listening. I was ill and before I even said a word, all 3 jumped in and offered assistance to help me feel better and checked on me the entire flight. The plane was clean and comfortable. I have and will continue to share my experience with others as I continue to fly Allegiant!

### "never be flying with them again"
Grand Rapids to St Pete Clearwater. Was one of the worst customer service I have ever received! They were extremely rude and it was outrageous at the tone I received from the customer service representative very inconsistent to what I had to say. The airline is not flexible at all and I will never be flying with them again!

### "Overall, not happy at all"
Omaha to Phoenix Mesa. I am probably never booking with Allegiant again. I'm not even sure about any airlines anymore. My sister and I had plans to visit our grandparents down in Arizona mid-February, but for medical reasons they will be coming back to Omaha before then. My sister and I got in contact with customer service as soon as we heard the news, because I don't think there's really any point in going anymore. And all they're willing to do for us is give us an $86 voucher each for future travel. We each spent $300. I understand their prices are cheap, but seriously? They're going to just resell those tickets anyway. Not very accommodating or understanding at all. And it doesn't help that they only fly to about three cities total from Omaha. Overall, not happy at all.

### "told me you should have come earlier"
Tri Cities to Orlando Sanford. I will never use this airline again! Rudest customer service I have ever seen. I drove an hour to get here in the snow and arrived early to my flight (which an Allegiant employee told me last time to be 45 minutes early) and there was no one at the counter. When I finally found someone they told me you should have come earlier. We closed the booth and there’s nothing I can do. I asked to speak to someone else and they told me I’d have to wait til they came out. I asked when that would be and they just said I don’t know. No refund. No reschedule. No help. I tried to call the corporate office and after 1.5 hrs on hold I finally got the operator to switch me over to the corporate number, just to get sent to voicemail and hung up on. Needless to say corporate never called back. No respect for their customers. I’d rather spend the extra money on an airline that is actually good. Never again.

### "I was late getting to the airport"
Unfortunately traffic happens! I was late getting to the airport and delayed getting through security and made it to the gate by last call only to have them literally shut the door on mye. They were so rude and did nothing to help me - ie rebook me on a different flight or even offer me a customer service rep to talk with. I ended up having to go to Sky Harbor and book a flight with American Airlines. I paid for two tickets and that has happened twice. The first time it was totally their fault when their plane broke down and I also forced to pay for two tickets because of their lousy customer service and limited schedule. Don’t risk it! Pay the extra money and go on a reliable carrier.

### "a pretty sad airline"
Greater Rochester to Orlando. What a joke this airline is. Always something. Either paperwork, or luggage, or pilot over slept! Today they got out of gate late, pulled out to runway, then told us there was a route change. Don’t have enough fuel onboard, so back to the gate we go. This is a pretty sad airline.

### "terrible customer service"
Niagara Falls to Punta Gorda. I’ve never given anything a review good or bad. But I had to with this airline. I’ve never experienced such terrible customer service in my life. I will never fly with this airline again. Nor would I ever recommend to go with this airline. I tried to reach a representative on the phone. Over three hours of hanging up and calling back being on hold for over an hour each time I finally gave up. My flight was canceled which is fine and understandable due to weather. Representative said I could extend my trip an extra day but that is impossible since they only fly out on a Monday, Wednesday and Friday. No reimbursement for the day lost. Also I could’ve waited to the last minute and paid $100 less than what I had originally paid for my flight. If I could give them less than one star I would. Also uploaded a screenshot of one of my calls how long I was on hold. Do not go with this airline

### "best experience with phone customer service"
I had the best experience with the phone customer service lady Phyllis who was so kind and patient with me about an upcoming trip. I messed up my reservation twice and she fixed everything back to normal. I really appreciate quality customer service and it shouldn't go without being recognized. Thank you Phyllis, may God continue to bless you.

### "gets delayed over 8 hours"
Cincinnati to Newark. Worst airline. We had a 7am flight and arrived at 5:30 am only to be told the flight was delayed until 12:30pm. We were irritated, but knew stuff happens. But no, it then gets delayed to 3pm and then 3:40pm. Over 8 hours, no excuse for that. And an $8 food voucher. That will get me a bottle of water at the airport.

### "never on time"
Greensboro to Saint Petersburg. I have flown Allegiant many times since I’ve moved to Florida and I will tell you - this year has been the worst. Never on time. Never. You board the plane when you’re supposed to be leaving and the people at the ticket counter have no idea what they are doing. I’m considering paying extra just to be guaranteed the right time and efficiency.

### "not worth the cheap price"
Provo to Mesa. Every time I have flown with Allegiant my flight has been delayed or inconvenienced in some way. In January my flight was delayed by 8 hours and my most recent flight the time changed 4 times. It's not worth the cheap price if you don't get to where you're needing to go to. The staff aren't horrible but the company is awful.

### "not a single enjoyable moment"
Booked a flight to Las Vegas out of Bellingham for this past Sunday, December 17th, we had to select a 2:45 departure losing half our day. Once boarded our flight 1812 we were met with mechanical issues. We were left sitting on the Tarmac for a while before they started de-boarding. Once inside we had to wait for further updates. Once they finally updated us they offered free pop and water. The  pilot was speaking to a passenger as she was exiting the airport, explaining she left her number and was going to the hotel. This was after 2 hours of sitting in the boarding area. Maybe an hour after the pilot left they finally made an announcement saying that we will be delayed until 9PM! At first they said no one could leave and return because TSA would be leaving. When asked if they could at least give the smokers a designated area on the Tarmac they hadn't even considered we have been at the airport since 12PM and would be landing in Las Vegas if your planes were taken care of and were reliable. Regular maintenance and planes on standby for these situations is part of the customer experience. They finally offered a 8$ voucher for Scotty Browns Social House where the going rate for anything is 15$ - some people had children and once at the restaurant I heard an older couple talking about their finances and ultimately went the entire day without food. When another plane arrived coming from Las Vegas the seating was different and those who paid for select seating we're told to expect a refund as we were now sitting in cramped conditions on hard flight chairs next to strangers. Even though they sat my friend alone where one of us could have sat with her and when asked if one of us could move to the empty chair they told us no. Once boarded it still took us an hour to get moving, making our departure for 10:30PM meaning we won't arrive in Las Vegas until well into 12:00 AM. They didn't even offer free snacks and beverages aboard your plane. We were told we would receive a $50 voucher towards our next flight and a refund on assigned seating on December 17th and it is currently December 21st and have yet to receive any further correspondence. As it stands I won't be flying Allegiant anymore. The worst part of this is the fact that I lost show tickets and had to still pay for the hotel I didn't arrive at until 1 am. I understand things happen and they ensured we got to our destination safely. I also understand that some things are out of the airline control and there is a lot that goes on behind closed doors that the passengers may not be aware of. I could take this experience as a one off but my returning flight was also delayed. There was not a single enjoyable moment with this trip.

### "just improve your service"
Flew Allegiant Air from Phoenix to Minot. TSA took over an hour to process everyone and they still let the plane leave. We got to the gate at 6.46 and plane leaves at 7 and they wouldn’t let us on. We could still see people boarding but they didn’t budge. So now we have to rebook for a different day since they don’t really care how you make it home. My checked bag will be sitting in Minot for days. The lady behind the counter “helping” people was the cherry on top. She was incredibly rude, and basically just repeated the mantra of not their problem. So for a friendly $75 charge I was able to rebook a flight. After she railed 20 people in line saying that we need to be here 3 hours early. I could fly out of O’Hare and not need to be there three hours early. What makes you think I’m going to get to the airport at 3.45am for a flight at Phoenix Mesa airport. Maybe just improve your service, and don’t fly 9 flights out between 6.30 and 7.30 when there isn’t enough support staff to handle over 1200 people coming through TSA. Never again.

### "$50 or they wouldn’t take my bag"
Pittsburgh to Sanford Orlando. Honestly the worst airline in the world. I sat in line for 2 hours just to check bags. There wasn’t even anyone at the counter because they said they don’t check in until 2 hours before boarding starts. Boarding started at 2:45 no one showed up until 1:30. I had rush to get through security and barely made it to Gate in time. Even the stewardesses were disrespectful. I paid $20 to check my bag online and thy had no record of it when I got there and I had to pay another $50 or they wouldn’t take my bag. Then it was apparently 8 pounds overweight and I was faced with pulling everything apart or paying an additional $50 for the baggage after waiting 2 hours in line with a 2 year old and a 6 year old. I asked to speak to a supervisor. The excuse, no one at any counters works for Allegiant. You can’t even get a cup of ice for your children, they charge for everything!

### "Horrible customer service"
Flew Cincinnati to Denver. Horrible customer service. Would not accept my checked bags that I already paid $40 for. I arrived at the counter 47 mins before the flight took off. Although the website says you have to be there 45 mins before the flight they wouldnt accept them, and then made me pay $100 at the gate to check them. Ridiculous service, I will never fly Allegiant again and I suggest no one does.

### "Extremely poor customer service"
Springfield to Destin. Extremely poor customer service. I was asked to put my bag in a slot when walking in. My bag did not fit completely in the slot so I was asked to pay $50.00. Once I sat down I slid my bag under the seat in front of me and it fitted perfect just like the passengers on both sides of me who paid zero. I sent Allegiant the pictures confirming that my bag fitted and asked for a refund, however, after 2 months of asking I receive a generic email saying that they will not refund my money. I am baffled that they will not even look at the pictures and treat me like a human being. Customer service is going down the drain and issues like this confirm it.

### "cannot take off on time"
Eugene to Mesa. Allegiant cannot take off on time. Their flights are delayed 2-4 hours 50% of the time because of maintenance. Their investment in new planes has not paid off. Allegiant has made over one billion dollars since inception and they cannot be on time. Very disappointing!

### "definitely fly again with Allegiant"
Providence to Punta Gorda. Great airline, they were on time, price was right, professional and courteous. I read some reviews online I was a little apprehensive about booking but I would definitely fly again with Allegiant Air - great experience and refer all my family and friends.

### "was a living nightmare"
I swear I wouldn't use Allegiant Air if they weren't the only airline to fly to my hometown. The trip from Las Vegas to Fresno was great. However the flight from Fresno to Las Vegas was a living nightmare. Flight was delayed (no problem, flights are always delayed), this wasn't any delay it went from 1 hour to 3 hour to 7 hour to cancelled. I sat at the airport for 10 hours without any communication and no one knowing what was happening. It was horrible. I managed to get home the next day on the first flight out. This is when I got upset, I received $350 in vouchers because what happen. I go to try and use them and only $150 work. I called the customer service (he was rude when he answered the phone) and he told me that they were all applied to my account. But I have 3 emails and all they can say is that it was an error.

### "communication is terrible"
Fresno to Las Vegas. The service and communication with this airline is terrible. Our flight was delayed about 6 hours, but that was not communicated to us. The pilot said everything was fine, but then we were told to get off the plane. We sat and waited for a new pilot for hours. The staff was not friendly in the least. After we had went and bought our own snacks because we were starving, they put out a few snacks for us. Not sure why it takes 3 hours to put out some sodas and pretzels. Guess that shows how organized they are! Will not fly with Allegiant ever again.

### "Can't even place our 4 kids together"
Orlando to South Bend. Worst airline. I rate them done with Spirit. Try to give them another shot and they blew it. Can't even place our 4 kids together on a trip. Employees are rude and if one tries to be helpful, the manager "corrects" their actions. This is why I fly Delta for work.

### "Horrible customer service"
Flew Allegiant from San Antonio to Las Vegas. The airline industry is a high reliability organization. Allegiant acted very unreliably today - how? For starters their communication with the affected passengers was very poor and they don't have a very good standard operating procedures to accommodate their customers and I don't trust them with our future travel plans. Use a different airline if you can. The flight was supposed to leave at 8.01 pm. At 7.45 they told us there was a problem with the plane. At 8.30 they told us the plane had been cleared but we couldn’t board for another 30 min. I️ went to go and find a drink and on my way back other passengers were headed my way saying the flight was delayed until 12.30. About 9.30 we looked up at the board and it now says 1.30. They didn’t even tell us. The staff were back behind the counter joking and laughing. Then they come on the intercom and say they have ordered pizza’s and it will be here in an hour. Horrible customer service. Very unreliable planes. I will never trust them with my travel plans again.

### "acted very unreliable today"
Austin to Las Vegas. Flight was supposed to depart at 7:45pm, at 1:30 am the airline announces that the rescue plane is not coming and that we needed to get our luggage and head to hotel. Some immediately moved to get their luggage only to find out that they could no longer enter terminal as TSA was gone for the night. Yet the desk clerk did not say that. Thank goodness we stayed because we wanted more info on hotel and new flight plan. We then find out that our flight was rescheduled for next day at 6:29 pm so we ask about hotel and they start handing out vouchers so they give us one for Hilton Airport - my wife and I decide to purchase a flight on another carrier so I'm on my phone doing this when we find out that we now have to take a shuttle to main terminal only to find out that once there the shuttle to hotel was no longer running, by now it's almost 3am. So I decide I'm going to uber our way there. We get to Hilton only to find out that they only had 10 rooms available that were already assigned to others and the airline sent too many over to them. We call the airline and they tell us to go to Best Western so we uber here and finally get to room at 3:50 am. Now we're getting ready to try this again so please pray for us. New airline Frontier so hopefully it goes better. The airline industry is a high reliability organization. Allegiant acted very unreliable today - how? for starters their communication with the affected passengers was very poor and they don't have very good standard operating procedures to accommodate their customers and I don't trust them with our future travel plans. Use a different airline if you can.

### "Happy with Allegiant!"
Price was good overall even though we pay for bags. A lot less than major carriers and it gets me from Harrisburg to Clearwater in a little over 2 hours. Major airlines have a stop in Charlotte or Atlanta and flying takes all day. This flight and one 6 months ago was on time and even early to arrive. I can sit in a small seat for 2 hours and bring my own drink or snack. Happy with Allegiant!

### "little communication for the delay"
We flew from St. Petersburg, FL to Asheville, NC to start our honeymoon on October 29th, 2017. We were scheduled to arrive at 5.09 pm and had dinner reservations for 8.30 pm. Our flight boarded a little late and we then sat on the plane for an hour and a half with little communication for the delay, until we had been sitting in the cabin for well over an hour. A part on the plane had been identified as bad, and had to be repaired or replaced. Approaching an hour and 45 minutes we were told to deplane. We sat in the lobby and were told there was no way to tell if we were still flying our that night, as no replacement plane was available. After persistent questioning from dozens of passengers we were told they were trying to repair the plane we originally were assigned. The staff at the ticket counter claimed they had no knowledge of anything else, or any plans Allegiant had for us. Another few hours passed. We then learned that Allegiant could not fly our after 10.00 pm. Some passengers left to rent cars and drive the 9 hour trip to Asheville, where it had just started snowing. One lady was scheduled for urgent medical treatment the next morning. Approaching 9.00 pm the staff gave us $8 in food vouchers for the food court and then announced we would be boarding another airplane in about 15 minutes. The food court was rushed and the staff were overwhelmed with orders while we began boarding the plane. The flight attendants knew nothing about the airplane, read instructions from a tablet and asked the pilot if they had to announce the instructions for a water landing since we were flying over land! They had to try the light switches on the light panel as they were unfamiliar with the plane and did not know where the floatation devices were located (the seats were marked that the floatation devices were under the seats, think about the safety ramifications of that). We heard these conversations from the second row. Enroute, the attendants on the flight told us they would provide us free water and soft drinks for our inconvenience. We finally arrived in Asheville close to 11.00 pm, and missed our honeymoon dinner. We got to bed at 2.00 am. We flew back to St. Pete on November 5th on the return Allegiant trip. The flight was scheduled to leave at 8.00 am. We boarded an hour late due to another mechanical issue, this time necessitating an oil change for a generator with a temperature gauge issue. We finally took off after 10.00 am with a mechanic flying in the cockpit to monitor the situation. In talking with frequent Allegiant fliers this happens all the time. So if you want to arrive on time, choose a different airline. P.S. We lost a half day of our honeymoon and a several hundred dollar dinner. Allegiant gave us $50 each in vouchers to have the experience again!

### "never fly this airline"
Sure, I saved money on the cost of the flight from Orlando to Austin but Allegiant did everything else wrong on this return trip. Flight was canceled / delayed, with no info on when it would take off. Booked another flight out that day, but had to rent a car in order to make it home. Cost me an additional $250 and 10 extra hours to get to my destination, due to Allegiant's incompetence. Never fly this airline.

### "flight 6 hours delayed"
The flight from Bellingham to Las Vegas was 6 hours delayed and all they gave us was free soda and an $8 vouture for food. Not happy with Allegiant. I missed my best friends engagement because of this. There was a flight to Vegas a few hours after the time mine was scheduled and instead of putting everyone that was on the earlier flight on the very next one and pushing that one back a bit so everyone only had to wait a few hours they had the earlier flight wait 6 hours. Not happy and would not recommend. I missed out on a very important moment in my best friends life because of this.

### "Don’t recommend this airline"
Las Vegas to Oakland. Don’t recommend this airline, people are rude. I was zone 2 and my husband zone 4 and they made us wait until everyone gets in. Plus they charge you for a carry on, this never happened to me before. They put 2 people on the same seat, super frustrated right now this is the worst company ever.

### "discount airline to a new low"
I purchased a ticket eight weeks in advance and paid extra to select a seat next to a friend of mine who is afraid to fly. When I printed my boarding pass for tomorrow, today, we were not seated together. I called and the first person hung up on me and the second person reiterated that they changed aircraft and someone else purchased my seat. Even though it was purchased long after I purchased mine, their computer system is unable to assign the same seats. They refused to see if their boarding passes have been printed and just told me that I must accept the new seat assignment. I give one star because they will get you to the destination. But the seats are terrible and do not recline, the people are nice, but this brings discount airline to a new low.

### "the last time I fly Allegiant"
Los Angeles to Medford. Horrible service at boarding in LA, in Medford the boarding crew was excellent. Planes are garbage, it's like being on a Schoolbus with wings. With added fees for carry on bags, for a little more you can fly a better carriers. This will be the last time I fly Allegiant.

### "getting what you pay for"
You are getting what you pay for. Sure, the flight from Colorado Springs to Las Vegas was cheap but their plans are never on time and typically have “maintenance issues.” I do not recommend flying with them unless it is your last resort. It would have been much more helpful to know that the plane was delayed sooner than 20 minutes after the scheduled boarding time.

### "wait for someone to show up"
Indianapolis to St. Pete. The Allegiant Air baggage check in is only open a certain time before boarding. So while you watch everyone on Delta and Southwest check their bags 2 hours before their flight, you sit and wait for someone to show up. Don’t plan on getting there early and relaxing because with Allegiant, that’s not an option.

### "so unprofessional"
I will never fly with this airline ever again! Worst service from staff and they were no help. Had to be in Vegas by 8pm and got delayed twice. Pretty much a wasted trip and they wouldn't even try to help my friend and I out to maybe get on a different flight. I tried calling them and was on hold for way too long. I should have read the reviews before I booked with this airline. Everything about the service from them was so unprofessional. It's the Walmart of airlines

### "never had any issues, until this particular trip"
Flew Allegiant Air from Columbus to Fort Lauderdale. I fly with this airline almost every month, due to my mother living in Florida, and, of course, the cost is typically much cheaper than other airlines. I've never had any issues, until this particular trip, when I was charged $100 to bring my daughter and I's luggage onto the aircraft. Mind you, I have never been charged, ever. The lady which charged me, stated there was no one, other than herself, which could stand as a manager to speak with me instead. She was beyond rude when I informed her of my frustration. She stated she could do nothing for me, and proceeded to slam my card back down onto the counter, after charging me. Again, I have never had any issues previously to this trip, but, at this point, I'm set back because of the faculty.

### "never use this airline again"
Belleville to Jacksonville . Abandoned passengers in Jacksonville FL 36 hrs before any other airline canceled due to Irma. I can forgive the 'charge for everything', I dealt with the seats that don't recline, I even looked past paying for a drink of water, but abandoning passengers that are facing a hurricane is inexcusable. They canceled the flight from Jacksonville FL to St Louis 36 hours before the airport shut down. All other airlines flying out of JAX that day completed their flights out. The weather was actually beautiful that day. They had even sent the 'check in online' the previous day, so we thought we were set. By the time we got the cancellation notice (about 4 hours before our flight), there were no other flights to be booked there or at any other airport within 300 miles. Fortunately, we had not quite made it to the airport, so we kept our rental car and drove all the way back to St Louis, through all the other evacuee traffic. Spent a total of 22 hrs in the car. We made it just fine, in spite of the add'l $500 in rental car fees, $200 in hotel charges, meal expenses, fuel, etc. What really is upsetting is the 'what if' questions. If the storm had been 12 or even 24 hours away, I would understand better, but Irma did not hit that area until Sunday night. Our flight was due to leave around 1pm on Friday. I cannot verify this, but it may be Allegiant did not want to pay to send an empty plane down to JAX to pick us up. The message we received claimed they canceled the flight due to passenger safety. JAX airport did not close until 7pm Sat night, according to the airport website. We will never use this airline again. I don't care how cheap their flights are.

### "not recommend them to anyone"
I was supposed to fly Allegiant home from Fort Lauderdale to Columbus yesterday. I was on a cruise that returned to Miami on Thursday with limited wi-fi. On Wednesday, I was made aware that my flight had been canceled due to the storm coming in. I tried to get on an earlier flight (Thursday instead of Friday) to Cincinnati but that was also cancelled. Allegiant prematurely cancelled several flights, leaving thousands of customers in harms way. I was lucky to be able to get on a last-minute flight through Delta who was bringing in extra planes instead of cancelling flights to help get people out of the dangerous area. This was my first experience with Allegiant and as a result, I would not recommend them to anyone. Have piece of mind and book Delta or another reputable airline, even if it costs you more.

### "it's all about hidden fees"
Springfield, MO to Orlando FL with Allegiant Air. If you had a disability or need to transport a medical device you will be charged at the gate for this. In my case I had a very small compact CPAP machine and a very small back backpack as my personal item. I was charged $50 by the gate agent in Springfield MO, for and additional carry on for the medical device. They don't care about the ADA, nor do they care about pleasing the customer, it's all about hidden fees and extra charges applied toward the customer. I wrote him to Allegiant customer service and got a camned answer a month later, saying they were not going to do anything about it.

### "the cabin crew allowed us to sit together"
Flew Orlando to Youngstown. On a plane that was only 3/4 full Allegiant Air decides to seat my wife in the front of the plane and me in the rear. Why? So they can charge additional fees for seat selection. $9-$23 per person. That's $18 to $46 if my wife and I wanted to sit together on a flight I book for us both at the same time on the same credit card. You just can't justify that. We refused to pay the counter girl who had no empathy. Thankfully the cabin crew allowed us to sit together in one of the many empty groups of seats. I won't ever consider this nickel and dime airline again. Even if the flight was advertised as free. By the time your finished with their nickel and dime tricks you could have flown on a real airline.

### "Allegiant Air tops it for the worst"
I thought Frontier was bad but Allegiant Air tops it for the worst. Flew Cincinnati to Denver. $100 carry-on fee. Absolutely terrible. I feel sorry for the people that have to work for this airline, it is the bottom of the barrel. Once is enough to realize it's worth the extra $20 to fly a real airline.

### "completely different experiences "
Fort Wayne to St. Petersburg. I had completely different experiences at the airports. Fort Wayne had amazing staff and were very accommodating! Once I got PIE it was a completely terrible experience! Fort Wayne has great staff and the manager there was exceptional! St. Petersburg could really learn customer service skills! My ratings are only applied to Fort Wayne.

### "My vacation was ruined"
Cincinnati to Las Vegas. Worst experience of traveling I have had! First the plane supposedly had to be downgraded so everyone's seats were wrong and my husband's extra leg room was not available. Then they lost our luggage for the entire trip apparently couldn't find it when I spoke with them on 8/18 and 8/20 (since we got an email that we also had a downgrade for our flight back) and then when I got to the airport they wouldn't let us board until they got a certain amount of volunteers to fly out the next day So we were late to take off. Then I stopped at the baggage area when we finally landed in Ohio again to check on our luggage and found out that they logged our baggage as found in Denver on 8/18 and no attempt was made to contact us at all. We wasted $200 on clothes and supplies in vegas that shouldn't have been. I still haven't gotten refunded for my leg space seats or luggage checked fees for both travel there and back or any communication about when I will be getting it. Instead I get requests for reviews and deals for our next flight. I will never fly this airline again. They don't even have a scanning system for their bags checked. You get what you paid for when buying a cheap flight through an airline with nobody knowing who they are but lesson learned. Do not fly them ever! Save the stress. My vacation was ruined and so stressful

### "expect delays with Allegiant Air"
This is the 3rd time in 12 weeks I've have flown with Allegiant. One flight cancelled and two delayed for four hours or greater. The first time being 6 hours with a child in tow and the second time being 4 hours. To compensate our first flight they gave us each a 50 dollar voucher (hardly compares to the 6 hour wait time). The second flight there has been no compensation! Allegiant is known to be delayed 30 minutes but my past two experiences has combined for a total of 10 hours in delays. I don't fly to be delayed, I fly to get to my destination on time. Allegiant has proven this is not a priority to them when they do not even explain to their passengers why we are delayed. Two 50 dollar vouchers for two poor flight experiences is hardly worth it. Either fly someone else or expect delays with Allegiant Air. There is a reason the prices are so low.

### "expect delays with Allegiant"
Sanford to Louisville. This is the 2nd time my wife and I have flown with Allegiant in the past month. Both times our flight has been delayed for a few hours. The first time being 6 hours and the second time being 2 hours. Both times we were on the plane/boarding and we were told to get off without any explanation. To compensate our first flight they gave us each a 50 dollar voucher (hardly compares to the 6 hour wait time). The second flight there has been no compensation! Allegiant is known to be delayed 30 minutes but my past two experiences has combined for a total of 8 hours in delays. I dont fly to be delayed, I fly to get to my drstination on time. Allegiant has proved this is not a priority to them when they do not even explain to their passengers why we are delayed. Two 50 dollar vouchers for two poor flight experiences is hardly worth it. Either fly someone else or expect delays with Allegiant Air. There is a reason the prices are so low.

### "Overall great experience"
Harrisburg to Orlando Sanford. Could not have been more happy with the experience from use of app for boarding, to the airport and then the plane. It was my son's first flight and he couldn't have had a better time. Yes, you have to pay extra for baggage and seat selection (as you do with most airlines now), but with the low airfares, it is still cheaper! The staff and pilots were extraordinary. The A320 we flew home in was practically brand new (they are moving towards an all Air Bus fleet). Flights were on time, no delays - arrived at destinations early. Also rented car through Allegiant and all I needed was the app on my phone to pick up. Overall great experience and will fly Allegiant again.

### "You get what you pay for"
Syracuse to Myrtle Beach. When the aircraft turned on, a loud constant high pitch noise occurred for a long period of time and it was ongoing until dimmed when we left the ground. The seats do not recline and the temperature was freezing cold on the plane; you could see customers bundled up from head to toe all throughout the aircraft. In addition, the flight was  delayed 3 hours before departure due to a gas spill. There were no updates over the intercom during the delay so confusion and frustration increased for customers. The one positive comment I have is the flight attendants were friendly and accommodating during a family members plane sickness. However, I do not recommend if there are other airline choices. You get what you pay for.

### "just say no to Allegiant"
This is my second-and last time-I will ever bother with booking Allegiant. The flight was 2 hours late arriving in and leaving from Missoula. I was in one of the airport concessions and was visiting with the person working there. She said that this was not an isolated incident-this flight is delayed on a weekly basis. I chose Allegient because I could get a cheap round trip flight to Montana. But once the carry on baggage fees, the cost of buying a seat assignment, the taxes and the weekly parking cost of leaving my car at an inconvenient airport because Allegient only flies out of off-the-beaten-track airports, turns out the price is comparable to flying just about any other airline. I'm 5'7" and my knees hit the seat in front of me. There is nothing free on Allegient-no beverages or snacks unless you buy them. Just say no to Allegiant.

### "book with someone else"
Not worth my time or money. My Allegiant Air flight from Cleveland to Punta Gorda was delayed for 7 hours! We were given a $50 voucher for a later flight booking, but I was told that I would have to cancel my return flight to use the voucher for that. I cancelled my return flight, but they would not refund my credit card, they just issued a second travel voucher for a future flight. I'll probably not be flying within the year and it will expire, and certainly not with Allegiant. Passengers were given a food voucher, but then told by the vendors that they don't accept Allegiant vouchers because they don't pay them back. Book with someone else. Seriously. You have been warned!

### "never been so irritated"
Appleton to St. Pete–Clearwater . I bought these tickets for my son and for my mother to bring him back after spending summer in wisconsin and I have never been so irritated with an airline. Yes, cheap tickets not worth the delay and stress. The plane was supposed to leave at 9am they left at 1/.45pm were on and off the plane 4 times before actually leaving. I tried calling customer service to see what the hold up is and waiting 50 min and still no answer from a real person. Never again will we fly with them.

### "so rude right from the start"
New Orleans to Pittsburgh. I have flown Allegiant three round-trips. Delayed or canceled every time. I used them more than once because they are the only airline with nonstop service from New Orleans to Pittsburgh. This latest experience was the worst. My boyfriend was visiting from Australia. We booked a flight on Allegiant to Pittsburgh to visit my sister. At 4am I get a text that the flight was canceled. No reason why. I called to see what they can do for us and spent almost an hour on hold. I finally get through to someone who was so rude right from the start. She would not help with hotel vouchers (we had to be out of our vacation rental that night and had another one booked for when we returned). I asked her to transfer me to her manager/supervisor, she said she didn't have one and disconnected me. I spent another hour on hold to get through to someone else (much kinder than the first but not great). She gave me the option of flying to another city and driving to Pittsburgh but could not give me a refund. I had to call back to confirm if we would take this option because I had to talk with my sister and my boyfriend. We decided to do fly to the other city but they refused give us any kind of voucher or discount for a rental car. The new flight for Cleveland was delayed as well. Neither the ticket counter to the counter at the gate had anyone there. Our flight home was delayed and the flight attendants on both flights were horribly obnoxious and rude. They issued a$100 voucher for our inconvenience but I did not find that acceptable considering how awful the ordeal was. I emailed several times, no answer. I called (with another 30 minutes on hold) to be told that I had to email my complaint. It has been 3 months and still no responses.

### "it's like a circus"
Allegiant Air flights are cheap, but their planes are never ready, and you aren't going to depart on time. They prepare for take off. Then, taxi to the runway. Then, return to the gate. Then, do a computer reset. Then, Prepare for take off again. Every time I've flown them, it's like a circus. Here's an idea: How about checking the plane before departure?

### "the seats were extremely cramped"
I flew from Austin, Texas to Cincinnati, Ohio through Allegiant. I chose Allegiant because they have a non-stop flight from Austin to Cincinnati and it seemed convenient. When I got to Cincinnati my flight landed at 10.33pm. I left the gate and immediately went to baggage claim and double checked with the Allegiant that I was waiting in the right spot. It took a minute for me to get their attention because the employees were in mid conversation with each other. I waited for about an hour and a half and began to get worried because that's a long time to be waiting for a bag. So at around midnight I went to the Allegiant help desk but there was no one there. I was able to chase down one of the employees as they were leaving to go home I imagine and she was very short and irritated that I was asking about my bag. I have flown a lot and I've never had to wait for a bag for so long so naturally I was worried. One of the other employees was walking by with my bag headed towards the desk so I went and claimed it and asked her where it was. She also was very irritated and said "I pulled it off the carousel" and walked away. The staff were very rude, the seats were extremely cramped, and waiting for a bag for an hour and a half is ridiculous. I chose Allegiant because the non-stop flight was convenient but I will never fly with them again based solely on how rude the desk help was and the long wait for my luggage. I will gladly pay the extra money through a different airline.

### "issued me a baggage credit"
Belleville to Punta Gorda. Allegiant issued me a baggage credit in Nov 2016. Went to use credit and it is hidden in a drop down arrow where you need yo type it in. If you do not click the drop down arrow, you will never have the opportunity to type in the voucher credit. It is very easy to over look. Appears the intent if Allegiant. If they wanted you to use it, they would make it visible with out having to click the down arrow. This is what happeed to us. We booked anyway due to we did not want to lose the price. Called customer service, takes 45 minutes to 1 hour to speak to a representative. Once through, they said it was too late and thanked me for my donation as they would not re-issue my voucher.

### "Worst airline I have flown"
Kansas City to Las Vegas. Worst airline I have ever flown with. Flight delayed both ways for hours. Could not get bags from airport for almost two hours- supervisor refused to explain why or even meet with people. Customer service representatives were rude and used foul language when interacting with customers. Maintenance issues on the second flight - kept telling us 15 more minutes -- no air -- rudest flight attendants I have ever encountered.

### "I won't be using them again"
Tulsa to Baltimore. I paid roughly $214 for my upcoming flight to include cancellation insurance. Sure enough, I had to cancel and received a voucher of $131! Not only did I not get my money back but they gave me a voucher for only a percentage of what I paid. What was the point in purchasing insurance? Their website wasn't working when I originally tried to book my flight online so I called to make my reservation. After waiting on hold for 46 minutes at 10:00 at night I someone finally answered and I was charged $30 to book over the phone. I won't be using them again!

### "Horrible customer service"
Arrived at Pittsburgh early this morning for flight scheduled to Tampa Bay. We boarded the plane and after a long delay, all passengers were asked to exit the plane. Allegiant staff alerted passengers to expect an hour delay. After several hours of waiting, they cancelled the flight! They stayed we could pick up our baggage up downstairs and that they would not be rescheduling the flight. Horrible customer service. Do not use this airline.

### "no plans to ever fly Allegiant again"
St. Pete–Clearwater to Asheville. My most recent trip was scheduled to depart Asheville at 6:45pm on Monday and was rescheduled for 12:00pm on Tuesday. Due to the fact that I had several Tuesday morning work meetings planned, the Tuesday option was no option at all, so I had to rent a car and drive from AVL to ATL to catch a flight with an airline that has a better track record for getting people where they need to go in a timely manner. For the costs of a rental car from AVL to ATL, the costs of a last minute Delta flight, the costs of my time, and the expense of my sanity, I could probably have flown Delta First Class for all of my previous Allegiant flights and still have come out ahead. While the automatic $100 voucher is a nice gesture (that nowhere near covers the actual cost of the incident) I am afraid I have very little use for a $100 voucher to fly on an airline I have zero confidence in. It is such a certainty of negative experience, that I feel guilty even gifting this voucher to an enemy. Unless there is a full overhaul of what has become the very worst airline I have ever dealt with, I have no plans to ever fly Allegiant again.

### "you get what you pay for"
Allegiant is the worst airline I have ever flown on. Pay the extra money to get a flight that is actually on-time. My flight from Eugene to Los Angeles was delayed almost 4 hours. Then my flight back was delayed as well. They don't tell you until after the flight is supposed to leave that its being delayed either. None of the staff realize whats going on. Terrible air service. You get what you pay for. Do not use this airline unless you feel like waiting endlessly at the airport

### "the worst flight I have ever experienced"
Undoubtedly the worst flight I have ever experienced. We experienced three departure delays, for various aircraft-related mechanical problems, which made our departure 6 hours late as well as our arrival in Knoxville. Allegiant Air, as required by FAA regulations, provided us 1 cup of warm water (during our last delay while sitting on the tarmac), and approximately a 2-ounce serving of Chex mixed with two tiny pretzels. Allegiant Air's website stated the flight departed at 12.00 noon, and arrived at 3.45pm. The stewardess stated we would receive vouchers from Allegiant Air, which I did tonight. They are for $50, are valid only for a future flight on Allegiant Air, and must be redeemed within 1 year. They are the only airline that flies that route - a 1 hour 40 minute flight, and would not have another flight for three more days. Their required policy submitted to the FAA states that they do not compensate excessive delays, which does seem to comply with Federal regulations. They classify delays resulting from mechanical problems as "a delay resulting from situations beyond their control" such as would be severe weather, control tower equipment problems, etc. My previous experiences with Allegiant Air had delays of usually about 1 hour, but the savings seemed to justify those delays. Their seat configurations favor adults with less than a 30" inseam. I cannot envision flying this airline again except under the most extreme circumstances. Even then I cringe at the thought. No amount of savings are worth what we endured.

### "horrible customer service "
Asheville to Baltimore. Beyond horrible customer service and ridiculous delays. Will never be flying this airline again. The cheap cost of the ticket doesn't make up for how horrible this airline is. Flight was delayed over 7 hours, they gave us an $8 meal voucher which wasn't even enough to buy a decent meal. Offered tiny cans of soda and water. Can't say enough negative things about them. Don't waste your money and more importantly don't waste your time.

### "I'm done flying with this company"
I don't think there is ever one flight that I have flown with Allegiant that hasn't had some sort of problem or delay. This airline is an absolute joke. I'm currently sitting at the airport right now going on a two hour delay from Peoria to Phoenix–Mesa. There was a malfunction and a mechanic was needed, so we then get the word that the mechanic is one hour away. Over an an hour went by then got word the mechanic was on site and still currently waiting to see when we are going to be leaving. After this trip, I'm done flying with this company. Never again.

### "not be using this airline again"
Cincinnati to Austin. I was excited about the cheap price but it doesn't make up for how bad the customer service was. The Allegiant employees working around the terminal were unprofessional and rude. When I asked the guy at the gate a question about whether I could purchase an 'early boarding' pass at the gate, he seemed flustered and then rude and eventually just blew me off. I was trying to make an additional purchase and he turned me away for some reason. When I arrived in Cincinnati the Allegiant folks took 60 minutes to start loading our stuff onto the baggage claim thing. I will not be using this airline again, even with the cheap price..

### "do not fly this airline"
Santa Rosa to Las Vegas. Spend a few more dollars and do not fly this airline. We have had 2 experiences with this airline and both have been horrible in more than just one way. Our flight got cancelled just like that a week before the flight, still working on getting our money back. First experience included almost 2 hours of departure delay without given an apology or explanation, on the way back we waited one hour inside the plane before the plane took off. Customer service not so compassionate or understanding of any issue or even get our own money back.

### "most horrible experience"
We had the most horrible experience with Allegiant Air. First off we were delayed from Sioux Falls to Las Vegas. They loaded the plane and we stayed on there for an hour before we had to deplane. Two hours later they told us that we were stranded for the night. They said they were going to give us vouchers for rooms, and then after an hour waiting they didn't have any vouchers. So we were all forced to front $250. The next day we were supposed to leave from Sioux Falls at 1248 and we were delayed until after 3.30pm. Finally arrived almost 24 hours later. Then on our return we were delayed 2 hrs again and then when we arrived we were stuck on the runway for an hour, due to not enough staff to unload the plane.

### "nobody would help me out"
Los Angeles to Idaho Falls. I am an adoptive mother of two boys (5 yrs old) and (8 yrs old). They have two full blood brothers. (18 yrs) and (11 yrs) and we decided it would be fun to have them come stay with us for a week during the summer. The brothers live in Anaheim and I saw the tickets on Allegiant Air for a very good price out of Los Angeles so I booked them. They have never been on an airplane before, but they are 18 yrs old and 11 yrs old so I thought everything would be just fine. They arrived at the LAX airport 2.5 hours early and checked in just fine, I received an email stating they checked in, bags were checked in. I guess they got held up in security, when they got to the front of the security line they told them they had 13 minutes to get to their flight. After they were done being searched they had 3 minutes to get to the flight. They asked the TSA staff where the gate was and he told these boys to go to the gate in the opposite direction, so they missed the flight. They  did not have a phone and had to borrow a phone to try to find someone to drive 3 hours back to get them. How do you check in 2 boys and not make sure they are on the plane? While I am sitting here in Idaho waiting for them, I get a message telling me they are not on the flight, and they do not know where they went. I was in the Idaho Falls airport and I asked the security guard if he could help me locate them by contacting someone in security at the LAX airport to make sure the boys were ok. He told me no and had me go stand in the Allegiant line. I waited patiently in line and finally up to the front to talk to the lady at the desk. I started to tell her what was going on and that I did not know where the boys were and she did not say a word - and put up a sign that said the line was closed. I finally got to talk to the man who handed me a piece of paper with a 800 number on it and told me to call and talk to them. I called the number and it told me I had a minimum 45 min wait to speak to a representative. I did pick up the boys luggage that was checked in and sent (without them) so now I have the luggage and my boys do not get to spend the whole week as we had planned. Allegiant told them to come back on Friday and they will let them on the next plane out of there. Yes 4 days later. I am still shocked that nobody would help me out during the crazy ordeal and would not help me find a flight to get them here to us.

### "poor communication, inconsiderate"
Worse airplane experience ever with Allegiant Air. Poor communication, inconsiderate, delayed for hours. Boarded flight from Las Vegas to Austin at 3:35 were supposed to depart at 4:04. Sat on plane baking in the heat until 4:40. Staff stated we had to burn off fuel because of weight issues and would have to deplane. Deplaned for a hour and a half. At this time we were told there was an incident that caused the runway to be shut down. Got back on the plane to find out more people and more bags had been added so the plane had to be recalibrated. Didn't depart until 7:35. Made it back to Austin at 12:09 am. Took 30 mins for bags to come off the plane. 20 mins ride back to terminal. Waited on shuttle to take us to car which waa another 15 mins. So horrible.

### "Our experience with was great"
We decided to use Allegiant Air to travel from Stockton to San Diego direct flight and value good. Once Allegiant opened we check in, luggage. Customer service representative at Allegiant was able to scan our boarding tickets from my phone. I would recommend you down load Allegiant app on your phone and pre-check in night before this process will be easy process. My friend recommended this and made it easier for us. Before we boarded our flight I informed the staff that scanned boarding tickets, my travel partner needed assistance with wheelchair. It would be difficult for her to walk the ramp to board plane. She took care of the arrangements and my travel partner was boarded with assistance and great customer service. Our departing and returning flights on time. She advised us to ask for assistance once we arrived at San Diego Airport and returning to Stockton Airport too. Our experience with Allegiant Airlines was great! Thank you!

### "fly with a better airline "
Las Vegas to Austin. This was my first time flying with Allegiant and also my last. Flight was scheduled to leave at 3:35 pm but was moved to 7:05 due to high temperatures in Las Vegas. I understand this was for safety reasons, but since the company is based in Las Vegas, why would you schedule a flight in the heat of the day during the month when the highest temperatures occur? When we finally boarded the plane at 8:10pm, we had to get off due to engine problems. Like other reviews we were told we will give updates every 30 minutes, we are getting you another flight, etc. At 11:30 pm we were finally told the truth, our flight was canceled. I don't even want to go into the horrible details of customer service and how most of the passengers had to sleep in the airport, myself included, because it was that bad. I will pay more to fly with a better airline that takes care of issues like this and actually cares about their customers. I truly don't believe the money you save is worth it.

### "this will be my last time"
Indianapolis to Ft Lauderdale. I have been flying Allegiant for 10 years and have been on about 100 of their flights. I have airways looked past the constant delays and maintenance issues with their aircraft's because the price was so low. However, this will be my last time flying with Allegiant. I was just charged $50 at the gate for a carry on bag. This is for the same little backpack that fits under the seat with plenty of room that I have taken on every single flight with them. I have never been charged for it. If an airline is going to have different policies at different airports they need to notify customers of that. The people sitting next to me have larger bags by their feet and were not charged. I've witnessed Allegiant employees being rude before and the unprofessionalism of some of the flight attendants is unbelievable. But the way I was just treated in Indianapolis is unacceptable. I'm actually relieved that I now have a reason to never give this company another $1 of my money.

### "I would fly Allegiant again"
Fort Walton Beach to Cleveland return, which apparently is only a seasonal route. The airline offers a no-frills service. When you buy your ticket you get a seat at a very reasonable fee. If you need more space you have the option to buy more at that time for a fee. If you decide later to bring more luggage, that decision will cost you a few dollars more. When you purchase your ticket, the airline will assign a seat at check in. If you need to have a specific seat, you can purchase that seat for a fee. The airline boards in about 6 or 7 zones, based on seat assignments. If you are the kind of person who likes to get on early, you can pay for that as well. Lastly, tickets are non refundable, and allow for no changes. So, if you think there is a pretty chance you will need to change you ticket, you had better buy the option to change it for a small fee. The planes I flew were A320s, which seat about 177, no seat back pockets and seats are fixed in place and do not recline. You get no free snacks or beverages, you can use major credit card to purchase snacks and beverages. So that is Allegiant Air in a nutshell. If you can deal with that, it is a great value. My flights were on time, actually one arrived early, and the staff was polite and professional. The airline starts boarding about 45 minutes before scheduled departure, so arrive early; because they do close the door 15 minutes before departure and you ain't getting on. I would fly Allegiant again, and recommend them.

### "it was far better than we expected"
We paid $89 to fly with Allegiant Air from Las Vegas to El Paso TX. Our expectations were "you get what you paid for" but actually it was far better than we expected. Our flight was supposed to be departing at 7am, it was 7.40am when we departed but it wasn't the airlines fault and they kept us informed about the situation. We arrived at the airport at 6.15am, the employees were friendly and when we told them our flight was at 7am they sent us to the front of the line. When checking the bags they were supposed to weigh 40 lbs and we ended up with 42 lbs, they didnt charge us any extra fee. It was a really good experience and we will fly with them again.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. I booked my confirmed ticket to Vegas with my mom and my boyfriend from 27th to 29th June return. And the airline cancelled the the return flight and we all 3 got stuck. And they didn't even have the courtesy to call us or anything. They just sent an email that your flight has been cancelled sorry. We had work the next day and we got to know about our flight cancellations a night before our flight. We all had to call in sick at our work and lost so much money. On top of that they had no other flight that day and not even the next day from Vegas. I mean they had no flight until 2nd of July (no flight for next 4 days). We felt like we are stuck here forever. We made a huge mistake by booking this airline. They gave us $150 compensation when we book flight from them next time. I mean this is not what we want. And I called their customer service the lady was so rude on the phone, I asked her to book another flight for us as it's not our fault that your airline doesn't have flight for next 4 days. She said sorry I can't do anything, you have to book it yourself. And the flight from same day was so expensive that we couldn't afford it (it's was more than 1500 dollars for 3 of us). We were so stressed out and our trip turned into a worst nightmare because of this airline. Then I called this airline customer service again and asked her which one is the closest city where we can take flight for next day. Then she told me there's one flight from Mesa, Arizona next day in the evening. So we told her to book that as we had no other option. We paid for hotels for one more day which cost us $450 dollars because we booked it on spot same day and then we booked a car which was $580 dollars plus fuel that costed us $100 dollars. My boyfriend drove us from Vegas to Mesa-Phoenix airport which was 5 hour drive. It was so stressful and depressing experience for us. We had to go through a lot on this trip. Even we reached Bellingham at 9pm, it took us another 3 hours to reach home as there was huge lineup at the border. Please be aware before you book flight from this airline. We had the worst and stressful experience. We will never book from this airline again.

### "lack the most minimum comforts"
I was very disappointed at Allegiant and Austin-Bergstrom Airport after taking flight 1337 from Austin to Cincinnati Sunday night. There was no mention by Allegiant, warning passengers that the airline was now flying out of the 'South Terminal'. The terminal was a long drive from the main terminal, and anyone not arriving in plenty of time could have easily missed the shuttle from the main terminal to the 'south 40' where Allegiant now departs and arrives. This terminal is primitive at best. There are no jetways; you walk out on the tarmac to the aircraft, then climb a long set of incline ramps to get into the plane. Not fun in Texas 90-100 degree heat; I can only imagine what that would be like in a rainstorm! Any passenger flying Allegiant out of Austin should be warned in advance via your website, email or text message that the airline is now using a remote terminal with very limited facilities. I have taken three flights on Allegiant. On all three flights, the seats do not recline. They barely have padding. Allegiant should warn their potential passengers that their aircraft lack even the most minimum comforts. There is no free beverage service; not even a glass of water. There is no WiFi, or any type of entertainment. Bring a pillow and blanket if you need one, and be ready to sit in the same position for the duration of your flight. The only thing this airline has going for it is price.

### "will never fly with Allegiant ever again"
Another Friday night ruined by Allegiant Air. At 7am I got a text saying my flight from Chattanooga to Tampa was delayed from 4.45 until 5.54. I arrived at the airport at 5, only to get a text from Allegiant saying it was delayed until 8.30pm. Nevermind the plans I had at my destination, this happens every time. I will never fly with Allegiant ever again.

### "staff are very unprofessional"
I advise anyone who is thinking about traveling with Allegiant to spend the extra $40 to get on a flight with a competing airline. Our flight from Vegas to Reno was delayed 5 hours eith no estimated time of arrival, there are no gate agents to be found at the podiums to ask questions, communication with the passengers is poor. After being delayed and boarding the plane we had to wait another hour sitting on the plane while they looked at a maintenance issue unfortunately we had to get off and the flight was canceled, the airline offered a hotel for the night but did not provide transportation to the hotel. The voucher was an $8 meal ticket that could only be used at the airport but unfortunately it was 10pm at night and all of the restaurants in the airport had closed. Although it's not the staff's fault the flight was delayed they handled the situation poorly. Gate agents are nowhere to be found and do not inform customers on the situation. Please please do not travel with Allegiant, the crew and staff are very unprofessional and the planes are always have maintenance issues.

### "it was very slow getting moving"
Flew from Fresno to Las Vegas and we were delayed over two hours due to a computer reset, they said (but not until we boarded was this explained) and then had to get someone to sign off on it and go through all the check points. Some people had to rebook flights as they were connecting out of Vegas and were missing those connections. Well, we figured this could happen to any airline. However, on the way back the exact same thing happened! That was preceded by an announced gate change from Gate B-6 to Gate A-16, except there is no gate A-16 and we were left to scramble with other passengers trying to figure out where in the heck we were supposed to be, although our electronic boarding passes did eventually get properly updated. That was the third gate change they announced for different flights in the three hours we waited. I've never experienced that with any other airline. When it was time to board, the loud speaker did not work so those of us who paid for priority boarding heard nothing unless you were standing next to the guy speaking. And boarding was a full hour before the flight was supposed to be able to take off. Without word-of-mouth few priority boarders would have made it. But there was no rush because we were delayed once again due to "computer malfunction" and another reinspection checklist. We sat on the tarmac for an hour and 40 minutes. Once the plane started it was very slow getting moving, we lost the A/C - 110 in Vegas! - and the exhaust smell was overwhelming because they left the doors open too long. The upshot was the crew was very pleasant to us but they looked harried and exhausted themselves. I'm sure they must be sick of this as I now know delays are normal with Allegiant. The low price that drew us in was anything but after all the added fees. Our $100 tickets each were $260 each when all was said and done. We won't be flying Allegiant again. There is much that needs to be fixed at Allegiant.

### "will not use them again"
I was apprehensive to begin with to fly Allegiant from Lexington to Myrtle Beach because of all the mixed reviews, but my family and I took a chance. While in line to check our bags, I received a text saying the flight would be delayed until 3:35 (was scheduled to leave at 1:09). I was not surprised, as I had been warned that that were notorious for delays. However, after getting through the gate, we received text after text delaying the flight for another hour and a half. There were problems with the engine from a return flight - supposedly from a bird getting sucked into it. Long story short, we finally boarded our plane around 6pm. As we got on the plane, the lights were flickering and it smelled strongly of gas. They seated us all and within about 15 minutes, had everyone get back off the plane due to auxiliary power issues. When we got back inside, we had to wait another couple of hours for maintenance to arrive, and thank goodness the problem was fixed and we finally made it to Myrtle Beach after being at the airport all day, 7 hours after scheduled flight time. I will say though, once we were in the air, there were no problems. The return flight was on schedule with no problems. I will not fly Allegiant again. We missed the first day of our beach vacation sitting at the airport all day. We did each get a $50 voucher to Allegiant for all the troubles, but no thanks. Will not use them again.

### "terrible airline"
As we were about to depart Punta Gorda to Columbus with all passengers in their seats for 45 min, we're told there's a "maintenance issue" that has been addressed but needs signed off on to "keep the FAA happy". Being told the same message 3 times, we're finally told to leave the plane because the issue was worse than expected. The pilot said that they'd do something to get us home today, and after another 30 min wait we're told that there will be a "special plane" sent to get us first thing in the morning. No offers for any alternative. Everyone was angry, as expected, and when asked when asked what accommodations will be, their customer service shrugged their shoulders and said we could "go find a hotel or wait it out". No offer for hotel vouchers, meal vouchers, or rental cars. I found a flight 3 hours later out of an airport 40 miles away on a competing airline and was laughed at when asking them to get me a ticket. I am going to have a serious issue now not being able to get to my office tomorrow. I've just been updated that the 6am "special flight" is now pushed to 1:15. Their best offer was $100 on their terrible airline for my next trip with them. I declined.

### "Delay, delay, delay"
Oklahoma to Las Vegas. Delay, delay, delay and lost a full say of our 3 day trip to Vegas! Stayed in airport overnight with a full flight of other travelers! Lost money & vacation time then felt terrible the 1st day to do anything at all from being at airport all night! Had to pay for a Vegas hotel that we didn't even get to sleep in! They have more excuses, same thing on return flight! Get your act together Allegiant. The Allegiant plane next to us, had to board, reboard 3x, broken down planes, over heated planes, had to sit in final plane 4 hrs waiting for all crew/pilot to get there from other places because Pilot timed out his hours.

### "one of the better flights"
Allegiant was one of the better flights I have taken in the last year. While everything is a-la-carte right down to a carry-on bag, to a bottle of water, the price was amazing, the flight attendants were professional, the airplane was new and clean and our flight departed and landed on time. We will fly Allegiant whenever possible as long as the rates and quality service continue to be amazing. My advice - take advantage of paying for the checked baggage or carry when booking or when they email you a flight reminder. Do you know you get one carry-on free as long as it can be placed under the seat in front of you. If you have to store it in the over-head bin then you have to pay. Also, drinks are $2 each, credit card only, no cash. However, I paid $3.90 for a bottle of diet soda in the airport when I could have bought one for $2 in flight. Knowing your options up front is the key to a successful trip with Allegiant.

### "Dreadful service"
Flew Allegiant Air Asheville to Baltimore. Dreadful service. They cancelled the flight after all of us had arrived at the airport, and then kept people waiting for a long time to get a hotel voucher. Their explanation for flight cancellation? Maintenance". The flight left the next day without incident and more or less on time. I've traveled Allegiant before and never had such a dreadful experience.

### "it's not worth it"
Please don't think it is worth flying Allegiant even if you got your ticket for dirt cheap like I did. It's not worth it. Flights will be cancelled - not just delayed but cancelled. But they won't be cancelled within a timely manner. You'll arrive to the gate before you get word of anything. First, they'll keep you hanging on to false hope that maybe your flight is only delayed, as they notify you in 30 minute increments to wait 30 more minutes several times over. After several hours of waiting only then will you be told that no, in fact, the flight is cancelled. As in - go home, find somewhere to stay tonight, and come back in a day or two to try again and that isn't even a guarantee. Actually, count yourself lucky if your flight is only delayed by 5 or 6 hours. Getting to your correct destination and on time is equivalent to winning the lottery.

### "worst airline I have experienced"
Allegiant is the worst airline I have experienced. We travelled from Las Vegas to Fresno, and that was declared delayed by 3 hours and when we got on the flight, the flight attendants were joking over the intercom and not really giving a damn about the passengers. Never knew how long the flight was because they kept saying the wrong thing and then laughing on the intercom. Doesn't go down well. Then we go on our returning trip; they turn up 20 minutes late at the check-in desk. Signs for check in are the wrong place so people were getting confused. Get to the gate and minutes before boarding they announce the flight is 2 hours late. That is after 20 minutes of people getting confused because the sign at the gate changed to Denver. I honestly hope people read this post, refuse to use their service and not use them.

### "staff made mistakes over the tannoy"
Flew Allegiant from Fresno to Las Vegas. The worst airline experience I've had, driving would have been a better option! 3 hours delayed on the way out and now 2.5 hours (and counting) delayed on the way back, with very little notice given on the delay. Regarding the flight itself, the staff made mistakes over the tannoy and openly laughed about it.

### "absolutely horrible"
Absolutely horrible from Oklahoma City to Destin - we will never fly Allegiant again! On our way to Panama City, they delayed the flight two hours. We are driving from Tulsa at this point so we continue on. We get there, wait hours until the flight and they cancel it 45 minutes before. We then have to go find all our luggage (we have 3 families, 12 of us). And decide to rent a car to just drive to Panama City. Then we barely hear over the intercom after an hour of figuring out rental cars the flight gets put back on. We arrive in Florida around 11:30pm. On our way home we arrive on time, then We're stuck on runway because there is another Allegiant plane loading passages on our gate. Babies screaming. The flight attendant keeps yelling over the Intercom to not let babies get passed off to relatives. Horrible. Never again and everything costs money - even water.

### "never fly this airline again"
I will state never fly this airline again after the horrific experience we had this week. We booked a trip with Allegiant to fly from Ogdensburg NY (near our home town of Ottawa, Ontario) to Orlando but it's actually Sanford which is about 45 minutes from the Orlando International Airport and north of the city. Our departure flight was late due to heavy air traffic in the Orlando area; delay of 90 minutes. There is no car rental agency at all in Ogdensburg, so if you happen to get stuck there, you're out of luck! On June 10, we arrived back at the Sanford Airport, having dropped off our rental, and entered Terminal B to check in for our return flight on June 11. It was a clear day. We were greeted by an airport person that advised up before even entering the check-in line that our flight had been cancelled, and we would need to go to Terminal A (?). Once we walked all the way over there, we were in a line with all the other passengers from the flight. Two employees were at the counter. It took us over an hour to reach the front only to be told the flight was not rescheduled and we could fly home on Wednesday! No offers of anything other than a voucher to fly again with Allegiant for the missed flight; not the total. All this resulted in us having to book another car; drive to Orlando; book a JetBlue flight at $1000 to Syracuse; rent another car in Syracuse; drive to Ogdensburg to pick up our car, then back to Watertown to drop off the 3rd rental of that day and drive home; arriving in Ottawa at 6:00 a.m. the following day! With flights and cars, the added cost was $1500! So much for a $69 airfare to Sanford! I could have flown business class from Ottawa on a major airline for less than it ended up costing us to fly Allegiant. I have tried several times to call the number listed on a slip of paper the airport employee handed us after our hour-long wait. I would caution anyone this is even remotely thinking of traveling with this airline to think twice. a major airline, you would be flying into and out of major airports where other airlines would be available, and partner airlines possibly available to help you get home. With Allegiant, they fly into 'fringe' airports that only cater to just them or them and a few other charter airlines (as in Sanford). They cancelled their flight with absolutely no explanation to passengers, and no rescheduling. Speaking with other passengers, this is a frequent occurrence with this airline.

### "do not waste your money"
Do not fly with Allegiant Air. Our original flight from Cincinnati to Myrtle Beach was delayed almost 4 hrs and now our return flight home is delayed. We have a 1 and 3 year old with us which makes this experience even worse. The customer service is the absolutely poor. Lady at the desk says that the reason for the flight delay this time is due to bad weather in Cincinnati, which is strange because my husband is in Cincinnati and says the weather is 83 and sunny. One of the airport workers told me to never fly Allegiant because they have flight delays every day because they don't have enough planes to accommodate the flights they schedule. I don't think I would be as annoyed if I hadn't had issues with Allegiant in the past. Do not waste your money.

### "frustrating, and exhausting"
Orlando to Moline. We arrived at the airport 2.5 hours early. My wife and I have 5 kids and pre checked in the night before. We had a stroller and a car seat so we could not use the express kiosk. We had to wait in line for 2 hours just to check our bags. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 7:15. My wife, my five kids and I rush through security and got to our gate in time before the flight left. We are just now taking off and it is 8:23. Very poor process and experience thus far. I would recommend if it is fiscally an option to spend extra money to use a different company. This has been a horrible, frustrating, and exhausting experience. Mistakes happen, I get it. Hopefully someone from the company reads this and treats this as a learning experience and look to grow from it.

### "Worst airline I had to deal with"
Worst airline I had to deal with. We (my wife and I) planned a 7-day trip to Grand Canyon. The flight from Santa Rosa, CA to Las Vegas (flight 569 from Santa Rosa to Las Vegas) seemed to be very convenient. No need to drive to San Francisco, inexpensive. We arranged everything: we booked a round trip flight with Allegiant, a car rental From Las Vegas airport, a week stay at the hotel in Flagstaff, some prepaid excursions. So we were waiting for boarding at the airport, hearing that the boarding starts in a few minutes again and again. Then we got a message that the flight was delayed for an hour. About an hour later, it was announced that the flight was canceled (without rebooking) for technical reason. We were not offered any option to have our flight rebooked with Allegiant or any other airline even we were ready to fly from any another other (San Francisco or Oakland) Bay Area airport. We have so many things scheduled (and paid for) already. We were told: "go to SFO or OAK and try to book another flight by yourself". We only got two $150 vouchers that we could use with Allegiant Air. Those vouchers are worthless since we are not going to fly with this airline. Never again! Money paid for the reservation for the roundtrip with the airline is supposed to be refunded (including car rental). At least Allegiant Air customer service representative told us so. It is still too early to confirm if we get all the money we paid during our booking with Allegiant. It may take a few day to confirm if we got our money back. But what about all other expenses? A week worth of taken vacation time, the hotel reservation that was too late to cancel, pre-booked excursions. I am not even talking about small things like driving to airport, paying for parking. Any normal airline would at least pay cash for "inconvenience" and would rebook a flight with another airline, pay for the hotel. As I said earlier we would be OK with driving to San Francisco or Oakland and fly from there. No company have the right to treat its customers like this. The company is supposed to be responsible for their poor service and for the "lost" customer’s time and money.

### "horrible customer service"
I didn't think an airline could be worse than Spirit. Then I flew Allegiant from Las Vegas to Kansas City. I paid $10 for boarding passes to be printed at the airport, then was told by Allegiant staff at the airport that I would need to download the app anyway because they would not print them. I had also booked two tickets, but the seats were placed in different rows, even though the rows we were seated in were not full. The airline refused to change the tickets to accommodate. For most airlines that is an automatic. Then, when boarding, flight staff tried to force us to put our carryons under the seat, saying only pre-paid carryons were allowed in the overhead. I had pre-paid for my carryons but they told me without even asking. Overall, horrible customer service. I am writing this before takeoff. Who knows what additional issues will happen in flight.

### "never fly this airline again"
Ft Lauderdale to Knoxville. I will never fly this airline again. I was supposed to fly into Knoxville from Ft lauderdale a week ago but the flight was cancelled after wasting the whole day in the airport. We boarded the plane and was then informed by the captain that there were "air conditioning" problems with the plane, however I don't buy it. They then had us deplane and cancelled it. It would have been nice if allegiant could have brought in another plane to get people to their destination because of mechanical problems but of course they did not and left us all stranded. Allegiant air made up for the cancelled flight and put me on the same flight today but to no surprise the flight was delayed almost 3 hours. Seats are not comfortable at all (there is what seems like a metal bar in the seat where your mid back lies), plane is hot, offered nothing but water. The only good thing about this airline is the price but I am more than willing next time to spend a little extra instead of dealing with this nonsense airline again.

### "never fly Allegiant again"
Las Vegas to Des Moines. Cancellation was notified 5 minutes before shuttle arrived to take us to airport, and was advised next flight out was Sunday, which was 4 days later, they didn't care if one was stranded! Our only option was to drive 24hrs back to Iowa. Will never fly Allegiant again, and advise that unless you have another way back from your destination you shouldn't either.

### "terrible overall experience"
Newark to McGhee Tyson. Unfortunately, extremely terrible overall experience. The booking itself was weird, went through many companies, everyone taking their share, Allegiant cancelled my flight 3 hours before and no one there to provide direction. I have a quadriplegic son at home and it was necessary for me to get back home ASAP, but no one to give any direction. The answer from Allegiant rep at airport was "you can drive 2 hours to the next airport, but I do not know whether you can get a flight from there. What a help! More than that, worst customer service you can even imagine. Regarding the cancelled flight, yesterday, I was on the customer line waiting for response for more than 2 hours, and no answer. Right now, I am again on the line, but still waiting. I will not recommend this airline to any one.

### "very frustrating"
Originally flew Allegiant Air from Pasco to Las Vegas June 2, 2017. Flight was delayed an hour, wasn't notified. Catching my flight back to Pasco June 5, 2017 and arrived in time and right as the boarding time came along, received a text. Saying that the flight was delayed another hour. It is very frustrating to have cab's set up and rides set up and have to rearrange everything last minute do to Allegiant's planes needing "mechanical work

### "cancelling and notified no one"
Pittsburgh to Orlando Sanford. I must stress the poor quality of staff, equipment and dependability of Allegiant Air. we reluctantly tried this airline because of the seemingly low fares. Our initial flight from Pittsburgh, PA on 5/25/17 was delayed 4 hours with no appearant reason, at the airport several passengers that flew this airline before stated they will delay a flight that is not full to double up passengers on the next later flight that day. Seats and inside of the plane were beyond bad and were like sitting on boards at best. Staff was less than friendly at best. Getting past this less than pleasurable part of our trip we ventured to Orlando Sanford Airport from our Daytona home on 6/4/17 for an early first flight of the morning 7:30 am to return home. A few moments after boarding was to have already began I received an E Mail from the airline with two 100.00 vouchers while wondering why they were sent we notice a while later the flight crew leaving the gate area, we assumed a gate change but to our surprise they cancelled the flight without explanation and seemed to care less about any passengers travels or inconveniences. We were told to head to another terminal for food and hotel vouchers that were another horrible excuse for customer service. We knew now what the vouchers were for, they new ahead of time the flight was cancelling and notified no one, the flight was rebooked for for 6/5/17 at 7pm. The food voucher for 2 entire days was 8.00 per per person.

### "rather pay a little bit more"
Flew Allegiant Air from Cleveland to Orlando Sanford. No greeting by any of the staff on the plane when boarding and landing. The only communication was asking to purchase a beverage and a 10 minute sales pitch to the entire plane on applying for their credit card. The plane was not clean and the seats were very hard and uncomfortable. The boarding process to and from our destination was long. Our return flight was just as unfriendly as coming down. The only difference was the speech for your credit card was half as long. Again, no greeting boarding or exiting the plane. I understand its a low cost flight but they charge for everything. The check in of $40 is crazy. We paid the $15 to carry a bag on and was limited to bag and my purse. Then you play for your seat, again I get it because that's how you keep costs down. But, to pay $10 for a boarding pass its a bit excessive. I printed from home and luckily the hotel allowed us or we would have been screwed to pay more. No coffee on the plane. We could pay at $2 though. The seats were like sitting on wood. I'm very disappointed and honestly would rather pay a little bit more and not deal with all of this. When its all said and done, your costs are not as low in comparison to other airlines.

### "she is very rude to us"
I flew recently on Allegiant Air from Cincinnati to Baltimore Washington. I did online check in and everything ahead of time as I am traveling with 2 kids. I stopped at the ticket counter just to drop my checked baggage. My flight was at 7.30 am and I was at the counter at 6.20 am to drop my checked baggage The receptionist at Allegiant air at CVG airport said boarding closed for that flight at 6.15 am, so she can not take my checked baggage. I asked there is 75 mimutes to the flight, boarding supposed to be closed 45 minutes before, why 75 minutes early, she said I dont know. Then the staff from the next counter came and said to her boarding for that flight is not closed until 6.45 am that means I still have 25 minutes. If the other receptionist won't come and correct her what should have happen. It's very annoying what she did to me when I am traveling with two kids, she is not helpful and she is very rude to us.

### "never fly Allegiant again"
❎ Unverified |  Las Vegas to Fresno. Got to the airport early due to hotel check out. Would not let me stand by for earlier flight even though seats are available. Would not let me check my bags and go sit in airport club to get work done. Making me sit in the ticketing area for 4 hours before being able to check in when no other airline does this. Their ticketing agents are rude. Their phone customer service is rude. And their overall customer service and policies are severely lacking in treating their customers right. Their customers pay their salaries. Their canned speeches at the end of a flight about having a choice of airlines to fly and they are glad you chose theirs and they hope to see you on a future flight is ridiculous. But they are right. I do have a choice of airlines to fly and I will spend more money or drive great distances to never fly Allegiant again.

### "No complaints what-so-ever"
Flew from Newark to Knoxville with my family of four. Tickets were $58/per person. Flights are very specific with regard to what days/times they fly to & from locations so you have to be flexible if you want a great deal! Our Thursday flight out of Newark was at 11:57am, because that's the only flight they have on Thursdays. We weren't able to fly home with Allegiant because they're flight between TYS & EWR on a Sunday is a 9am flight (like I said, very specific) and 9am on Sunday morning didn't leave us enough time to enjoy our last day away. So here's the scoop, the seats don't recline, food and drinks are for a fee (nothing is complimentary), and there's a fee to pick specific seats on the plane so your party can all sit together. That all being said, we left on time, the flight attendants were friendly and professional, the ride was smooth, and we arrived 5 mins early. The next time we travel, Allegiant will be the first airline I check with for travel deals. No complaints what-so-ever.

### "not offered anything besides water"
Allegiant Air are the worst airline I've flown with. They loaded us onto our already delayed (by one hour) flight from Las Vegas to Colorado Springs, just to have us sit there for over two hours, when they would come over the loud speaker to inform us of updates. All they would say is that it was due to "paperwork". For the first whole hour of waiting, there was no air conditioning provided (mind you we were in Las Vegas so it was hot). They finally gave us Air Conditioning and offered us "complimentary cups of water". Absolutely unnaceptable! Not only did we have to sit on the small plane for over two hours but we were not offered anything besides water the whole time or to compensate for our time waited. I am flying with my 3 year old daughter and she had to sit there for this whole time during dinner time, we weren't able to even get off the plane to get her food. The whole situation is completely ridiculous and I will never fly Allegiant again.

### "worst flight of my life"
This was perhaps the worst flight of my life. Trust me they are cheap in many ways. Operating from a very small airport in Idaho Falls, they delayed my flight by 1 hr 30 mins. I hadn't a connector from Las Vegas from the other terminal. The inflight attendants and people at gate were rude and did not pass the message that I wouldn't be late for the connector. When I contacted their customers care it took forever to connect and somebody went it's not their job to see whether the connector was made or not. Upon saying I would lodge a complaint the lady went "we don't care about those". I wonder with that attitude how are the things still in business. For the record, while I write this review I am waiting in the boarding area for the return flight to Idaho Falls - and it's late by 2 hrs. Till now I have experienced the usual "we dont care" attitude. I am trying to be as reserved as possible when I'm reviewing this. It's worse than that. I have had better experience with the worst bus services. Their app is the worst as well. I believe they don't be understand the concept of updates because you'll probably be stranded at the gates and receive the update after you reach your destination

### "Cabin crew was top-notch"
Oakland to El Paso. Fantastic last-minute airfare. Flights departed on time and arrived early. Cabin crew was top-notch. Ultra-friendly and helpful. Boarding process was fast and efficient. In-flight announcements were crystal clear. Aircraft aren't new. You pay for every service, including in-flight refreshments. And you pay for carry-on bags. But, you're sometimes able to get a round-trip airfare fewer than four days before departure for the price of other airlines' cheapest fare.

### "Unexceptional service"
Phoenix to Missoula. We got a text an hour before our flight saying that it would be 45 minutes late. Now it is 3 hours later and two planes scheduled to land after us have left. No updates or reason why we are late. Unexceptional service is to say the least. The lady on the telecomm keeps forgetting to say which flight she is referring to so everyone is confused.

### "a cancelled flight and setbacks for many"
Our flight was cancelled and moved to next afternoon after a safety issue that the crew did not notice until a customer pointed out. He was joking about it, but eventually it led to a cancelled flight and setbacks for many. Allegiant believes that their offer of $100 voucher for next time is an appropriate way to handle the situation. I disagree. I like many other customers will end up eating the cost of a day lost that we were supposed to be in Las Vegas and Allegiant offers poor customer support and solutions that I would call satisfactory. While I understand that a safety issue is not a foreseen event, I do not believe Allegiant offered anything close to the value of the costs eaten beyond anything booked through Allegiant. It is frustrating that Allegiant believes that they offered great customer support when indeed they did not.

### "Good value for the money"
St. Petersburg to Huntington. I have always been very happy with Allegiant. I have been flying this route routinely for the last 3-4 years. I have experienced few delays, ground and in-flight staff been always polite and accommodating. From booking the trip to arriving at destination, I have only good things to say. Good value for the money. I really hope they continue to fly this route for a long time!

### "flight was delayed multiple times"
Baltimore-Washington to Asheville. The flight was delayed multiple times from 8:41pm-10:20pm, and once we finally boarded the filthy plane, we sat on the jet way for an hour, where we were then told that we we had "dangerously low" hydraulic fluid levels, and we would need to return to the gate. We did not receive another update for at least 15 minutes, and when we did, the pilot was not sure if we would be able to complete the flight-- maybe, probably, and stuttering occurred, all very reassuring. We took off at approximately 1:15 am to arrive to Asheville, NC around 3am. The flight attendants ran out of water on the plane (we were on it for 5 hours). Once we arrived the people that were force to gate check their luggage seemed to be the last ones standing - oh because they didn't see the luggage. Thank goodness for one employee who was very helpful and went back on the plane and got everyone's luggage. Allegiant did email everyone a $25 voucher for future flights, but I do not think anyone on that flight will ever fly allegiant again!

### "rude and unprofessional"
Cincinnati to Fort Lauderdale. As I entered the aircraft and found my seat I was told by a flight attendant who was standing across from my seat to place my carry on bag under the seat. I had a carry on bag and a personal bag. I told her that carry on which I paid extra for is too big to go under the seat and should go in the compartment above. She said there is no room above my seat. I quickly scanned the upper compartments and saw right there lots of empty space in the compartment above other seats. I place my bag there and made my way to my seat. Than I heard the flight attendant making comments about me with another passenger. She didn't even try to hide it. It was rude and unprofessional and made me feel very uncomfortable.

### "awful airline to deal with"
Delayed 4 hours out of Casper to Las Vegas we didn't get into Vegas until 130. Now we are trying to return from Vegas to Casper and once again delayed because we have no crew. Totally unprofessional - they say they have low prices but nickel and dime for everything from luggage to picking your seat. Ridiculous. Would caution you or at least give a heads up that this is an awful airline to deal with.

### "what we got was a disaster"
Worst airline ever. We expected a quick flight down to Florida with Allegiant Air and back. What we got was a disaster. Our 9.00pm flight got cancelled after waiting until nearly midnight because of a mechanical problem. Flight the next day managed to be on time. On the flight back, we were already delayed about an hour from weather (not the airlines fault there), but about to take off and had to head back to gate because of yet another mechanical issue. Lovely. With all the negotiating of the airports and dealing with this horrible airline, we could have driven down and back for about the same time and paid way less than these "discount" tickets. If you're considering this airline because they're cheap, just don't. You get what you pay for. Subpar aircraft that appear to not be well maintained.

### "never once had a flight depart or arrive on time"
In almost 10 years of choosing Allegiant Air, I have never once had a flight depart or arrive on time. my grandmother is 80 years old and we had to send her from Asheville to Punta Gorda by herself as we all live in FL. Her flight was delayed 3 hours. She did not get home until Midnight. This was not the first time I have been disgusted by Allegiants day to day operations but this the first time I wrote a review. Their airplane interiors are very cheap. The flights are cheap because every area of normal airline service is completely absent. Terrible airline unless you are broke and desperate. I would fly Delta 10 times over before I got on another Allegiant flight.

### "the lack of customer service"
Oakland to Eugene. I have never been more frustrated with the lack of customer service that I have experienced with Allegiant. I have sent multiple messages and tried calling multiple times, and have been unable to reach anyone. In March I had to fly from Oakland to Eugene due to my sister being in hospital. After arriving at the airport my flight was delayed. Then again. Then again. Eventually, after sitting in the airport for hours, it was canceled and I was told I would be receiving a small credit and the possibility (not guarantee) of a flight out the next day. The credit was not even enough for a full trip. Not only was my time wasted, but I then had to buy a last minute flight from SFO in order to make it to Oregon. It also meant that my ~$65 ride to the airport was for nothing. I had to pay for my new flight out. I had to pay to then get from the Oakland airport to the SF airport during rush hour. My family who had already driven two hours to pick me up at the Eugene airprot had to turn around and then drive 4hrs during rush hour to get to the Portland airport where I would now be flying into. And since I had now been at airports nearly all day I had to pay expensive prices for airport food. I have emailed and called numerous times and have never gotten in touch with anyone. I occasionally get emails back saying they will respond in 60 days. It has now been two months and my complaints haven't even been addressed. To top it off, I can't even access the credit I was promised.

### "staff was so gracious and patient"
Mesa to Springfield. We had a situation that required a ticket modification. A staff member with Allegiant out of Las Vegas was so gracious and patient. She went above an beyond the call of duty to listen carefully to what we needed, to reassure us that she was there to help us and then to make the necessary changes to the ticket so we could extend a stay to attend to a family matter. We have flown extensively around the world over the last 20 years. Her care stands out as exceptional and ranks as one of the best customer services experiences we have ever had.

### "I feel we were mistreated"
Yesterday while flying with my young daughter from Arizona to Great Falls we encountered a less than pleasant and accommodating flight attendant. My daughter, who is 9, were split up initially and my daughter became quite anxious and tearful about not being able to sit with me during the flight. However, after realizing there were multiple open seats I kindly asked if it would be possible to relocate so my daughter and I could sit together. The flight attendant appeared rude and annoyed when replying saying it was an inconvinience as she was counting passengers yet had just accommodated a fellow passenger who requested a window seat. After very reluctantly allowing my daughter and I to move one row up to be together she proceeded to tell us to "hurry up or get back to your original seat". She then tossed my sweater at me which I had left back in my original seat. This was a very disheartening and disappointing experience to say the least. I understand flight attendants have requirements to complete (ie: counting passengers prior to departure) however I feel we were mistreated. Customer service should be a priority. I will not be flying with Allegiant Air in the future.

### "customer service not willing to help"
Dayton to Tampa with Allegiant Air. Flight delayed for an hour and then canceled. Flight was rescheduled for 24 hours later! Had to book from a different city with terrible problems due to family flying also! Customer service not willing to help or even care!

### "never fly Allegiant again"
Columbus to Punta Gorda. These were the worst flights I have experienced. The seats are so close together and are hard. We are seniors and my husband was in pain through both flights. The employees are great and flights were on time, but we would never fly Allegiant again.

### "unpleasantness of the flight"
Stockton to Las Vegas. We flew out Friday April 7th and our flight was delayed 3 hours. I have never had an unexplained delay happen to me for this long. Onboard the plane as they are serving drinks they spilled on my friend's lap. The flight attendant said sorry, but didn't offer to grab her a napkin for it, until my friend spoke up about it. The flight attendant was rude in handling the spill and then proceeded to not take my friend's order. I had a ginger ale and the same flight attendant told me I had to finish it and stood there waiting for me with a scowl on her face. I understand finishing your drink before landing, but 2 more times another flight attendant walked by asking for trash after that, so there wasn't any urgency. She was by far the rudest flight attendant I have ever experienced. The price is not worth the delay or unpleasantness of the flight. I will be flying any other airline in the future.

### "in the airport after three delays"
❎ Unverified |  Ogdensburg to Fort Lauderdale. Still in the airport after three delays. We were scheduled to leave at 9:50 am. They tell us our plane has mechanical problems and they are going to try to fix it. In the meantime another planes arrives that is scheduled to pick up people and go to Orlando. So they take our luggage off our broken plane and put it on this plane . But of course the people originally scheduled to go on this new plane to Orlando are bumped and are to have to wait for our original plane to be fixed. Just as we are to load on the plane they announce that it also is broken. We are all now sitting in the terminal double stacked looking at another 90 minute delay - they now tell us they are looking into getting two new planes. No food or drink in the terminal, not a great start to our four day holiday.

### "never fly this airline again"
Orlando to Richmond. They boarded us for our 8am flight. Then deboarded us for technical issues. Then delayed us until 11:40. Then told us the flight was cancelled and would be flying out the next day at 2:30. I had to work the next day and cannot miss work. So I had to book a flight with JetBlue for $600. All Allegiant Air did for my inconvenience was refund me and give me a $100 voucher. This screw up on their end cost me two Ubers ($40 each), my whole Easter spent in airports, and an extra $320 to get on the JetBlue flight. A total loss of $400 plus a whole day of Easter in airports and all they could do is give me a voucher for $100. I have never heard of a 32 hour delay. This is ridiculous! I will never fly this airline again. Spend the extra money and fly with a better airline. Their cheap fares are not worth the headache.

### "technique to get extra money from us"
Chicago Rockford to Las Vegas. Not a bad flight for the price and the Rockford airport is much easier to navigate than O'Hare but frankly when I book the tickets together we should be sat together. I should not have to pay extra to sit next to my husband, especially when there were seats available. Shady technique to get extra money from us!

### "don't inform you on anything"
Knoxville to Fort Lauderdale. It was delayed due to a worker from the airport dropping jet fuel right outside of the plane. Nothing was wrong with our plane we just had to wait for it to be cleaned up. However, that took almost two hours with no air on a small confined aircraft with over 100 people. Not once did allegiant offer a drink or snack while we waited and the two men sitting next to me were in the wrong seats and the flight attendant acted like it didn't matter. The flight attendants were rude, and not once offered a drink or snack as we all sat there and sweated. Then, once we finally do get to our destination we have to sit there for another 45 min because they can't get the door open! Awful. I've flown with Allegiant multiple times but this flight was terrible. Very disappointed. I don't expect to have tv or free food on your flight, however I do expect to get a free snack if we are delayed that long and flight attendants don't inform you on anything. Neither did our pilot. We sat there for almost an entire hour before the pilot even informed us on what was going on.

### "plane was dirty"
Our first experience with Allegiant was June 2016. We had booked a weekend away to Clearwater for my husbands birthday weekend. The morning of our flight, we got a text that the flight had been cancelled. Took hours to get through to Allegiant. Received no explanation as to why it was cancelled and an alternate flight was not offered. They did refund our money but we lost a lot of money and time on previously booked excursions and meals. Not to mention my husbands birthday was ruined! They did also give us a voucher towards another flight, which we reluctantly used this past weekend. This past Friday March, 31, 2017, we were to fly out of Wilkes-Barre to St. Petersburg. Our flight was delayed by over 2 hours. Once finally on the plane we were stopped on the runway due to a mechanical issue with fear that we would not even be able to take off. Nearly 2 and a half hours past initial departure time we were finally cleared after they got the mechanical issue fixed. Now to think we are on a plane for the next 2 hours, a plane that just had an issue and couldn't take off. Once in flight, the pilot came over the speaker to tell everyone he apologized for the inconveniences and that the flight was almost cancelled as there was no pilot to fly the plane. Said he came in on his day off to fly it. The plane was dirty and had a terrible odor on it. Was afraid to touch anything. The bathroom was just disgusting. Smelt horrible and had mold near and around the sink and toilet. The only thing Allegiant had going for them was the staff. They were all friendly and helpful. I would not recommend this company to anyone! Not to mention once you add in all the fees for baggage and to pick a seat so you'r guaranteed to sit with your family, this company is not any cheaper than a real company like Delta or United! You don't even get a complimentary drink, you pay for a soda or water.

### "rent a car and drive"
Niagara Falls to Sanford with Allegiant Air. 8.30pm flight delayed for mechanical issues. Had us de-board the plane, wait for 3 hrs to then tell us we would be given vouchers for taxi and hotel and rescheduled our flight for 3.30pm the next day. The handling of the vouchers was a mess, there were 4 Allegiant staff members behind the counter - 1 of which was sitting down eating pizza. Instead of working efficiently by dividing up the stack of vouchers amongst them, they had 1 person call out names 1 by 1 of every individual on the plane while the other staff members just watched. In general, the staff lacked professionalism, compassion, and competency. To make matters worse, there was only 1 taxi that would accept the voucher. When I notified the Allegiant staff, I was told with a condescending tone that I could just walk to the hotel if I did not feel like waiting. At this time it was 1.30am and 34 degrees outside. The following day was not much improvement. The staff were sluggish and unconcerned. The bottom line, if your only option is to fly Allegiant Air, my advice is to rent a car and drive.

### "I will never do this again"
Mesa to Provo. First and last attempt at flying this airline. They cancelled our flight 30 minutes after we were supposed to board. Was it for weather? No. Was it for mechanical problems? No. Was it because they didn't even have a flight crew? They had a plane, but apparently no one to fly it. So, a trip I've had planned for quite a while, took time off work and made multiple plans ... ruined. (My twelve-year-old son, not happy.). I am writing this review due to the complete lack of respect the frontline people showed the passengers in this crisis who just had their flight cancelled. They were very short and rude to the passengers in fothe not of me in line to the point that I simply got out of line and left. Allegiant Air has failed miserably to train their frontline people how to act in these situations. My money was ultimately returned, but only after about an hour of phone time and a dropped call (they hung up on me while on hold). I will never do this again.

### "never fly this airline again"
Indianapolis to Fort Lauderdale. Made the mistake of thinking Allegiant would be cheaper. After paying over $200 in baggage fees, and standing in a ridiculously long line at the ticket counter, with absolutely no staff in sight for over an hour, the worst customer service I have ever experienced, I wouldn't call it a bargain. I will never fly this airline again regardless of how cheap they appear at first.

### "my flight has been canceled"
❎ Unverified |  I booked with Allegiant. I was to fly out at 5:30 pm. Planned to leave for the airport at 2:30 to be there at 3:30. At 11:30 I received an odd email giving me an Allegiant air voucher. Then 15 minutes later I get the email that my flight has been canceled. Being last minute I had to end up paying 4x the amount to book a flight with another airline. In addition I ended up getting to my destination over two hours later. I then tried calling customer service because I did not want a voucher and each time I called (a total of 3 or 4 times in the next 3 days) it said there was over a 30 minute wait time on the phone. On the last call I waited the time and spoke with a representative finally. She suggested I email the airline so I did. I then got an email back thanking me for my email and even though the subject line stated "they will be in touch soon" the email stated that it could take 60 days for a response. It has been ten days so far and no response yet.

### "crew friendly and helpful"
Punta Gorda to Cincinnati with Allegiant Air. Flights have always been on time, uneventful, and flight crews have always been friendly and helpful. Some may complain about the comfort and add-ons/upcharges, however, it is a discount airline, and with that, the fancier whistles and bells some higher prices carriers offer aren't going to be offered. No, the seats aren't the most comfortable, especially for plus sized individuals, but again, it's not meant to be first class accommodations when flying a discount carrier. Overall, I am pleased with my experiences with Allegiant, and will both recommend and fly them again in the future.

### "an unorganized company"
Fort Lauderdale to Indianapolis with Allegiant Air. What an unorganized company. Our gate was changed 3 times in 25 minutes. The flight time (both ways) was changed 3 times. How do you run a company with this kind of schedule changes? What about customers that had connecting flights? It's obvious that is not important. They charge for everything. The plane was dirty. The counter staff were cold and non-customer oriented. I could go on but since this will be my first and last experience with Allegiant, it is moot.

### "Perfect for short trips"
Fort Walton Beach to Las Vegas. In hindsight I should've definitely taken the car rental discount Allegiant Air offered. I would recommend and will fly with allegiant again. Unless you need the extra legroom or just prefer a certain seat or need to sit together, I wouldn't pay to reserve a seat. Perfect for short trips!

### "offers amazing value"
Los Angeles to Medford with Allegiant Air. I have flown this route every few months over the last 5 years. This airline offers amazing value. If you just buy the basic ticket (let them assign your seat, use mobile boarding pass, and pack light in a backpack), your price is always 50% less than the competing airlines. I think it is amazing. As far as airline performance, I would say 90% of my trips have been uneventful with no major delays or problems. I think that is pretty standard for air travel. I've experienced just as many delays or cancellations flying this route with Alaska or United.

### "seats are very cramped"
Las Vegas to Stockton. Ticketing is cheap, $5 for a boarding pass? $18 for a carry on, $18 for the 1st checked bag only if you pay online before the flight. Seats are very cramped. Window seat we got was next to the engine so you get a headache 5 minutes in. Selecting your seat is $8 extra. Soda is $2 and they won't let you bring a soda on board. Never fly with them again.

### "no consideration for their customers"
Worst trip ever with this airline! Upon us arriving early for our flight we were informed that the flight was initially delayed for 3 hrs. We checked our bags and decided to leave the airport until two hrs before the delayed time. I received an alert on my phone saying my flight was rescheduled for the next day. No explanation, just a text. I later received a call from someone stating the flight was "rescheduled" and when could I come and get my luggage. I informed the customer service rep that I had to rely on someone else for transportation since I had already turned in my rental car. They stated ok. I received two more calls from the rep stating that I could come and get my luggage within 10 minutes or come at 8.30pm when someone returned to the ticket counter. I went back at 8.10pm awaiting the arrival of a customer service rep. No one ever came. I waited for over an hour only to finally get in contact with an employee who stated that I would have to get my luggage the next day because no one was returning to the airport that night! This airline has no consideration for their customers. Even though their prices are inexpensive you pay for it in customer service quality and care.

### "seats are very uncomfortable"
First time flying Allegiant Air from Trenton, NJ to St. Petersburg Fl. The flight attendants are rude, the seats are very uncomfortable, the tray tables are half the normal size. Flight was delayed without any explanation. When I asked the flight attendant when does she expect us to land in St. Petersburg, her response was depends when we take off. I asked when does she expect us to take off, she said depends on how fast we board. But once we take off the flight time was 2 hours and 38 minutes. My only reason for asking was for me to coordinate my pickup ride at the airport and since they did not update the flight status on line or texting it was completely unknown. No consideration and complete lack of customer focus. Last time I checked being curtious did not cost anything extra. Also if you want water it will cost you 2 dollars.

### "never thought to inform their paid customers"
Without a doubt the worst experience of my life flying with Allegiant Air. I have travelled with all airlines from around the world both domestic and international. No airline has been 7 hours late, not updated their website even hours before the flight to advise their passengers. They admitted they knew the day before the flight from Bellingham to Las Vegas would be delayed but never thought to inform their paid customers. Even further they have a flight departing from the same airport to the same destination leaving on time 3 hours after our originally scheduled time and arriving on time yet our flight is to be told we will arrive 6.5 hours later than them. This is one of many consistent delays and problems this airline does to its customers. Spend the extra 100 dollars and fly with anyone except Allegiant Air.

### "just one of many unsatisfactory experiences"
This is just one of many unsatisfactory experiences on Allegiant. We are on our return flight to Phoenix from Oakland, CA. Were first informed of a delay 2 hours prior to scheduled departure. The delay was increased 3 separate times until eventually a 7 hour delay. Instead of accommodating our flight with an earlier plane, (plenty of empty planes on the ground in Mesa,) Allegiant does what it does best - mess their customers around, making them wait so they can save a buck. A $50 voucher doesn't come close to compensating.

### "love the cheap prices of tickets"
❎ Unverified |  Knoxville to Fort Walton Beach. This was my first flight using Allegiant Air. The 2 concourse employees plus the two agents at the counter were shabbily dressed and those at the concourse were eating and drinking at their kiosk in plain sight of the customers. Once onboard we were very professionally greeted by the 4 flight attendents! The lead gave the usual intructions preflight but spoke in such a rapid manner it was very difficult to understand him. When beverage service began I put my tray down only to see it was filthy with crumbs and greasy fingerprints which I brought to the attendent's attention. She did immediatley return with a clean wipe and cleaned my tray. I noted that crumbs were all over the floor in front! All 4 attendents were very professional and neatly dressed. The pilot and copilot never came out of the cockpit to thank the passengers for flying Allegiant as very usual on all flights. I must congratulate the ground crew at VPS for their rapid unloading of our luggage for it was the fastest I have ever encountered! By the way, my flight number was 684VPS on 3/06 and my seat allocation was zone 3 seat 10E. We were informed was only 1/2 filled but we were not allowed to change our seats because of "security" reasons. I much prefer a window seat. I confirmed my reservation as requested 24 hours before departure online. The flight was supposed to take 1 hour and yet we arrived at our destination 20 minutes early! I love the cheap prices of tickets and easy to access online site.

### "solid bang for your buck"
Flew Allegiant Air from Raleigh to New Orleans. No frills airline, solid bang for your buck. Yes, you get nickel and dimed for literally everything (all the way down to printing boarding passes $5). No, the seats do not recline. No, there isn't wifi on board. No, you don't get a free drink for flying (drinks/snacks offered aren't outrageously priced). No, the gate staff aren't the best. Yes, flight attendants are just as good if not better than some I have flown with. Would definitely fly again. We were delayed on our initial flight out of RDU to MSY for Mardi Gras due to mechanical issues, but that happens to every airline. The direct flight that's offered now was significantly cheaper (over $400) than other airlines and honestly no complaints other than the nickel and diming and the initial delay. Would fly again.

### "I continue to be impressed"
❎ Unverified |  I had another great experience with Allegiant Air flying from Concord, NC to St. Petersburg, FL. This is probably my tenth time flying them and I continue to be impressed. Yes, they are an ultra-discount airline which means that you pay for any necessary add-ons. When you do your reservation on-line, you will see all the added fees before hand and not have any sticker shock at the airport. My round-trip from Concord, NC to St. Petersburg took place without a hitch. Both flights were on-time. The crews (except for one surly-faced flight attendant on the flight down to St. Petersburg) were all polite and professional. The planes were very clean and the gate crews at both ends did a good job of getting everyone on the plane in an orderly and timely manner. I would definitely fly with Allegiant again.

### "they are just the worst"
Las Vegas to Fayetteville. Absolutely the worst airline. I have flown Allegiant three times and each time I hoped my experience was a fluke, but unfortunately they are just the worst. I would like to say you just get what you pay for, but when you include foods and bags they cost the same as any other airline. This last flight they lost they place in line to depart because they took too long to board. We were delayed over 2 hours for a 2.5 hour flight and were not allowed to leave the plane to get water or food.

### "Disappointment is the only word"
Las Vegas, Nevada to Bozeman, Montana. Disappointment is the only word to describe this. My flight has switched to four different gates! In which two planes had mechanical problems after they had just landed. I'm sitting in the airport and have been waiting for three hours, they said "we will board at 8:00 pm. If the plane is fixed" - If! We don't really know what's going on". I would not be worried if I knew that Allegiant would pay for a hotel if it never gets fixed, but everyone says they won't. So far I have seen my own two planes broken down today but also a third plane for the company. The airline might be cheap but cheap quality comes with that.

### "go with any other airline"
Hagerstown to St Pete Clearwater. Allegiant delayed the flight 3 hours before it was scheduled to depart then issued me a credit voucher instead of a refund and refused to pay for the hotel I had to stay in overnight in addition to the one I booked in Tampa for my vacation. Customer service takes at least 30 minutes of being on hold to get in touch with and when you do talk to them they're totally useless. I'm rating one because a zero won't let me submit it. Save yourself the hassle and go with any other airline there is.

### "Think twice before booking"
Rockford to Punta Gorda. 3 hours before leaving for the airport to head to FLA for a long planned winter vacation, I get a text from Allegiant, "Your flight has been cancelled!". No explanation and weather good at both departure and arrival airports. After looking at reviews and talking with others, there seems to be a common trend of this airline just cancelling flights. Think twice before booking with Allegiant.

### "I always buy the extra perks"
Cincinnati to Las Vegas. I love Allegiant Air, it is great value, with wonderful flight crew and direct flights. I've flown them at least 5 times with no issues. I think some people get put off by some reviews, but for a long weekend somewhere, Allegiant Air is usually always the best value in my opinion, and I always buy the extra perks.

### "worst airline I have flown"
Reno to Las Vegas. By far the worst airline I have flown. I arrived at the airport 1 hour and 30 minutes before my flight was scheduled to take off. When I arrived I asked women to check my back which would've been 30 dollars or so. She then proceeds to tell me they are about to close the gates and that I need to leave and run to my gate. So she refuses to check my bag. I arrive at the gate at about 12:30. 1 hour before my flight is schedule to take off and at the time they were to begin the initial boarding process. The lady at the desk rudely says so I assume your Crystal and the reason we haven't taken flight yet. They then proceed to tell me next time I better arrive early and charge me 50.00 to have one carry-on bag for a 45 minute flight. Do not recommend them at all.

### "I am very pleased with Allegiant"
Stewart to St Pete Clearwater. I flew alone with my 3 kids (their first time on a flight, ages 6, 4 and 2). I didn't pay for seat locations so I had them assign our seats. They were great to place us next to each other however I couldn't do online check in. I had to wait at the ticket counter to check in and get charged $5 for each boarding pass to be printed. The plane is no frills but I came prepared with snacks and ipads and crafts for my kids to pass the time. On the return flight we were supposed to get a huge snow storm at home. Allegiant cancelled the flight around 12 pm when our flight was set to leave at 7 am. I received a text and email which was nice and a few minutes after that another one with the new flight info. I was nervous since Allegiant only flies Thursday and Sunday to my destination but they rescheduled it for the following day, Friday. Overall I am very pleased with Allegiant and look forward to flying with them again!

### "not use Allegiant Air again"
My flights each way (from New Orleans to Raleigh) were delayed for maintenance issues. The numerous Fees charged exceeded cost of flight. Will not use Allegiant Air again even though it is a direct flight. I thought this would be a good alternative but without time or money saved, better off flying a trusted brand.

### "nothing positive to say"
Ogden to Phoenix Mesa. I have nothing positive to say. This airline caused me to miss my grandmother's funeral due to lack of appropriate planning and communication on their part. After a whole day spent at the airport, being told the plane would be leaving at 1, then 3, then 4.30, then 6. What was originally supposed to be a 10:25 am departure, ended up in a wasted day, tears, and heartache. In the end, I ended up not going at all because I had already missed the funeral that started at 5pm. They refunded my money and gave me a $50 voucher for another time. To me, this does not even begin to make up for the heartache and stress they caused me and my family today. I am so severely disappointed in how this airline handled the issue. They didn't update the flight info, they waited for hours to update anyone and they were only offering flight vouchers but no refunds. They only refunded me due to the severity of my situation.

### "definitely give them another shot"
Memphis to Las Vegas. I had a very mixed experience with Allegiant. First, our flight was delayed, but they emailed and texted us almost 2 hours before to let us know that would be the case. It happens, we appreciated the heads up. We were a little disappointed by the absolute now frills and nickel and diming that the airline does, but that's what you get with a low cost airline. Our big hiccup came when we landed in Las Vegas and found out that our bags had not been loaded on the plane. That meant that my wife and I, and our 3 year old and 1 year old had nothing (Due to charging for carry-on's we chose just to check everything). We were on vacation for 10 days and it took them 7 days to get our bags and car seats to us. But before I condemn anyone, Allegiant did right by us. They told us to go out and buy what we needed and they would reimburse us. Obviously we were skeptical, especially as the days went on without us getting our bags or car seats. But when all was said and done, they did reimburse us and we got a weeks worth of clothes out of it. It wasn't an amazing experience, but they did what they could to make it right. I'd definitely give them another shot.

### "would not recommend this airline"
Las Vegas to Indianapolis. This was my first experience with Allegiant Airlines. Like many others, I was enticed by the so called "low airfares". Soon thereafter I realized that it was all a facade. I had already paid $25 to check a bag and was told I had to pay an extra $50 because my luggage was 5 pounds over the weight limit. So in essence I paid $75 to check one bag. This is absolutely ridiculous! The lady at the ticket counter showed no sympathy whatsoever as she responded in her robotic, uncaring voice. When I got on the plane I realized you have to pay for any snacks-$3 for a small box of M&M's! At one point in the trip, the flight attendant whacked my knee cap quite hard with his service cart, hard enough to make me scream out. He asked if I was all right but continued rolling the cart down the aisle, not even waiting to hear my response. Nor did he even come back and apologize or ask if I was doing OK. And the button to recline my seat was absent, so I remained upright the whole three hours of flight time. I would not recommend this airline to any of my family or friends.

### "poor customer service"
Concord to New Orleans return. If you are use to flying with a reliable airline this company is not for you. Sure. The flights are cheap. If you are okay with poor customer service, uncomfortable seats, and cancellations that leave you stranded, this airline is for you. After four days in New Orleans our return flight was cancelled. We were told the flight would be rescheduled for the following day but they couldn't confirm when that would flight would depart. After speaking with a customer service representative who stated " I don't know what you want us to do" when I asked about a hotel compensation. I was thoroughly disappointed. Needless to say $316 later (out of pocket) a rental car and ten hours later. My friends and I are almost back home. Oh, and half of us have to return to work in a few hours.

### "had horrible service"
Las Vegas to Oakland. This airline was delayed on both routes, and had horrible service. The flight out was delayed 2 hours prior to boarding, then another hour once boarded due to issues "getting the plane started". The flight back was delayed due to another delayed flight "taking our plane". We had to wait for another flight to land and send us back to our destination. Despite what appears to be a cheap ticket, it's not worth the ridiculous fees or the travel disruption.

### "filled plane with too much fuel"
Orlando to Concord. Awful experience. Gross negligence and incompetence. Flight was delayed and rerouted to an alternate city because Allegiant filled the plane with too much fuel. Spent an hour sitting in the plane without moving. Terrible communication and rude flight attendants. There was no reimbursement nor restitution for the 2+ hour inconvenience. Recommend never flying Allegiant.

### "what an unpleasant experience"
Allentown to Orlando Sanford. This is my first time flying Allegiant Air. All I can say is what an unpleasant experience. First off they nickel and dime you for everything. Seats, bags, etc. I booked a hotel through them when I purchased my tickets. I then find out the hotel is over an hour away. To take a shuttle through them it would cost over $200 dollars to get to and from the hotel. Then they offer park passes to Universal Studios. So I purchased them. Well the hotel is in Disney the hotel does offer a shuttle to Universal. This was supposed to be a pleasant trip to help us cope with the anniversary of my daughter's death who passed away a year ago. I thought this would be a good thing. But now we can't even take off from Allentown because the plane has a mechanical problem and now we are delayed for hours. I should have flown with United Airlines.

### "airline got the job done"
Phoenix to Oakland with Allegiant Air. This airline got the job done. Simple as that. Customer Service over the phone is terrible. I've spent a collective 3 hours trying to get in contact with a representative. Speaking with the workers of Allegiant at the airport, they even confirmed that trying to contact Customer Service over the phone was an average 45 minutes to an hour. Ridiculous. The flight attendants were great people. I would recommend this airline, but only to those who understand that it's not going to be a great experience if they run into issues and need to contact customer service.

### "stop charging for normal seating"
Tampa Clearwater to Richmond. Allegiant Air should stop charging people for normal seating. Everyone, naturally, chooses the most inexpensive seats. So I'm sitting in this plane that is half empty and everyone is jammed into the back of the plane!! The entire front half of the plane is empty. You have the stewardess monitoring each persons seats. Once the flight was airborne there was a mass exodus as people were finally allowed to redistribute themselves more comfortably throughput the cabin. This is dangerous and stupid!

### "flight rescheduled several times"
Las Vegas to Oakland with Allegiant Air. Worst service. It will be my first and last to ride on this airline. Spent 6 hours at the airport, flight was rescheduled several times then cancelled at 9:30 PM and rescheduled the next day. Missing my family occasion and work. No meal ticket, no hotel voucher. Staff are not friendly even in the plane. Poor customer service and will not recommend.

### "not for people used to reliable airlines"
This is my first and last time flying with Allegiant. I booked a flight from Las Vegas to Oakland round trip. First, they hit you with hidden seat fees, bumping the cost up already by a good 12-30 dollars depending on where you want to sit. I got no updates on the 1.5 hour delays of both flights until I checked the Allegiant app. Other airlines typically notify you through email. My flight back to Vegas was cancelled outright as we were all supposed to board. No compensation and the earliest flight they could get was the next day at 5pm. Allegiant workers also informed us that since they do not partner with any airline there was nothing else they could do about the flight. No apologies. Allegiant would be ideal for people who carry no bags and who have flexible travel time, but it's definitely not for people who are used to reliable airlines.

### "no refund or voucher"
Stockton to Las Vegas. I book today at 3:23pm for a flight leaving at 4:53pm. I chose an emailed paperless boarding pass. Rules suggest 2 hours early, 45 min for check baggage and 20 min prior to boarding for carry on with boarding pass. I arrived at 4:20pm with no one at the ticket counter. People were still boarding. I was turned away due to "just an emailed itinerary " not a boarding pass' told I was too late to do it with an app. I was told I should have come 2 hours early. Why was my flight even allowed to book online if that's the case? To keep my money? Why then did the plane leave 15 min early? No refund or voucher! No answer when called on customer phone. Rediculous! Never try that again.

### "horrible customer service"
Casper, Wyoming to Las Vegas return. Our experience with Allegiant was terrible from start to finish. Our flight was delayed in Casper for nearly 3 hours, and the "manager" (I use that term very loosely) was unaware of the delay until informed by passengers on the plane. She was extremely unprofessional, as were the other employees working the check in counter. They were talking loudly amongst themselves, eating and drinking and goofing off while there were people in line, waiting to be checked in. They could barely be bothered to even converse with the customers. After we finally made it through security, this "manager" was completely confused as to why everyone was now waiting at the gate. She was sitting in a wheelchair (one that is intended for handicap passengers, as she has no walking impediment) wheeling herself and kicking herself around the terminal in said wheelchair, all the while addressing the passengers and others in the room, making sure we were aware that she was indeed the manager and that she was completely unaware and uninformed about when the plane would arrive and what was causing the delay to begin with. It was then learned amongst the passengers in the room that this "manager" had called several of the passengers of the plane and informed them of the delay and then we had an extended wait time because those passengers hadn't arrived yet. Once on the airplane we had a horrible ascent, and descent. Once we arrived at our destination, we arrived 3 hours passed our schedule arrival time. Because of this, our car rental reservation was canceled and we were stranded in Las Vegas with no car and no cell phones. On the return flight, our flight time was moved up by 2 hours without our knowledge and we nearly missed our flight, and after rushing everyone onto the plane, we proceeded to sit on the plane and wait for them to "fix" whatever was wrong for the aircraft for the next hour, at which time we now needed more fuel prior to take off. I will never fly with Allegiant ever again. Horrible customer service.

### "terrible first experience"
Phoenix Mesa to Stockton. Terrible, terrible first experience. The airline staff was rude after we found out the airplane couldn't land due to fog in Stockton. They get on the announcer to tell everyone that they will provide water but just some water and if you wanted a bottle you would have to purchase it. No water, no snacks throughout the flight and with the airplane in hold mode in the air for another good hour before flying to next airport to refuel. They go skimpy on water? People were up in the morning at 4am to get to the airport and board at 6am. Not thinking we don't get water or even a snack. It would have been bettter if the lady that made the announcement was a bit more human instead of a person that sounded like they only cared about making a sale. We land a new airport only to be delayed 2 more hours before flying back to Stockton CA. Get back on the plane and staff again (same people) sounded like they dont care anymore. They had to do a head count. 3 members did the count and had different numbers! I guess they couldn't do basic math. How do you mess that up. Its not like anyone got up and did some magic trick to play with them. So we sat on the plane another good 20 mins before take off. Passengers were getting very restless at this point after all the delays. A two hour flight turned into a 8 hour ordeal! I can keep going on and on about them but I wont. Pay the extra 100 bucks and fly right into Sacramento if that is where you're going in the first place.

### "extremely slow to provide updates"
Allegiant Air canceled our return flight home from Las Vegas to Belleville and was extremely slow to provide updates as to when the next flight out would be. Over 2 hours after the flight was canceled, all they had told us was that the flight would be the next day. No times provided. As for vouchers, they provided an $8 airport food voucher for people to use for both lunch and dinner. $8 at the airport will cover a cup of coffee and maybe a muffin. Thanks, Allegiant. They are also providing overnight accommodation, however they are not willing to help people find other flights. Horrible airline!

### "fly Allegiant very regularly"
Flint to Clearwater. My girlfriend, my friends and myself fly Allegiant very regularly. Out of our last 10 round trip flights we have had one overnight delay and 2 one hour delays. Which in the big picture of life is nothing.

### "never going to fly this airline again"
Flight left gate 13 minutes early, I was at gate 20 minutes early they did not give my refund back but issue me a airline voucher good for one year. I am never going to fly this airline again, I have to rent a car with my family to drive 16 hours from Bellingham WA to Oakland, there are no phone numbers to call no one at checkin counters, no one answers my email. Please pay extra to another airline if you love your life.

### "told me to wait at the wrong gate for the delayed flight"
Flew Allegiant Air from Las Vegas to Missoula. In the first place, the flight was delayed to 1pm instead of 8am. The problem is that the employees told me to wait at the wrong gate for the delayed flight to Missoula. When I realized it was the wrong gate, I asked them again if it was the right gate but they told me the flight had just left. Then they started to treat me poorly, they did not seem empathetic at all about the fact that I had missed my flight and even laughed in front of me. This was very upsetting given the fact that I missed my flight entirely because of their mistake. They also failed to help me find another flight until I continually asked for their assistance. They finally found me a flight in another city of Montana which was Great Falls. So, the inconvenience cost me a night in a hotel and transportation to go to Missoula.

### "ridicule and rudeness of staff"
My family (Husband, 15 month old daugher and myself) flew from Kansas City to Las Vegas on 12/22. Our flight attendant was more than rude and unprofessional. We were seated in the first row on the plane. We had bought our 15 month old her own seat so my husband, our daughter and myself had our own space. Our daughter was having trouble adapting to a confined space and was having a meltdown. My husband and I were trying everything we could to help soothe her during our initial taxi. The FA was on a huge power trip. Traveling with a toddler is stressful and not pleasant for anyone. She was lecturing us and talking down to us the entire flight was unnecessary and in poor taste. I was on the verge of tears by the time we landed because she wouldn't stop meddling in our situation. On our way home, we flew from Las Vegas to Rapid City, SD on 12/27. The universe must've been working against us since the same FA was on our return flight. This time my husband was seated in the exit row and my daughter and I were seated catty-corner behind him to his left. During initial prep, the FA had asked the exit row customers the routine "incase of an emergency" questions. My husband answered yes, he was willing and able. Half way through our flight my husband and I had traded spots as we switched off entertaining our daughter. One FA stopped at the exit row and told me I would need to pay for the seat if I was going to sit there. I explained to her we had already purchased the seat and were switching for a few minutes. The FA proceeded to make her way back to plane a few minutes after my conversation with the first flight attendant. She told me I wasn't allowed to sit there as she didn't initially brief me. I told her I understood and that I would switch seats with my husband. She returned 2 minutes later and had asked me if we had paid for the seat my daughter was sitting in. I said "yes. I'm upset because as a lead flight attendant, it's her job to know which seats are vacant and half way through a flight she was questioning us. 3 minutes pass and she approaches my husband who is now back in the exit row. She explains to him that she didn't brief him during the initial briefing and that he would need to be reseated. She also mentioned that if something were to happen during the flight and the FAA were to find out she allowed someone to sit there who wasn't briefed, she would be in a lot of trouble. To me, this all sounds again like her problem and again not knowing which seats are paid for and occupied. My husband said he would be reseated. She then proceeded to tell him that he wasn't allowed to move because the seat belt sign was on. So she briefed him while standing there and asked for a verbal confirmation. She then ended the conversation with "in the future, don't sit in an exit row. For the later half of our flight, she 3 times came back to talk to us and made us feel like we were trying to short change the company by stealing seats. She was on a complete power trip and was very unprofessional. In the future, I will pay double the amount of money to fly on a better and classier airline that Allegiant. It's not worth the ridicule and rudeness of their staff.

### "overall terrible experience"
Fort Lauderdale to Cincinnati. Allegiant Air got everyone on board, but before take-off the captain informed us a service light came on which required maintenance. This problem took over an hour to be fixed, the captain gave insufficient updates and let the cabin get extremely hot for long periods of time. Just an overall terrible experience. Flight attendants were not in proper uniform, shirts torn up, not tucked in, one attendant appeared as if they didn't want to give any instructions. Aside from their ridiculous bag fees, this is equally terrible service. If needed pay the extra and avoid Allegiant by all means, especially if you are traveling with children and/or seniors.

### "were stranded at the airport"
Sanford Orlando to Memphis. We booked a flight and a car through Allegiant Air one week in advance. Flight was over 1 hour late, the plane was nasty inside, lights kept flickering and the intercom didn't work half the time. We had reserved side by side seats, but our plane broke down they gave a substitute plane and separated us! We paid for premium and found our car was booked but not paid for! Enterprise doesn't accept a debit card for a one way rental and they don't take cash. We were stranded at the airport. Everything was shut down. Only a drink machine. I am disabled, so my husband was helping me and managing bags. Called Allegiant Air and was on hold for over 45 minutes. We can't get any money back, they will issue us a voucher. Heaven help you if you choose this company!

### "every time it gets delayed"
San Diego to Provo, UT. Allegiant Air is awful! Every time I try and fly this airline it gets delayed, they'll tell you it's delayed 15 minutes, every 15 minutes, for 2 hours, until they eventually just cancel the whole flight. I am so disgusted by how this airline is run and it makes no sense why they would be so disrespectful to their frustrated customers as well. Learn how to run your business and get better employees. If I could give this airline no stars, I would.

### "not worth the headache"
Horrible airline and customer service. Do not fly Allegiant Air. Pay the extra money and fly a dependable, reputable airline. My flight from Los Angeles to Tulsa was delayed three hours, then once landed, sat on the tarmac for an hour because the flight leaving out of Tulsa was delayed (shocking) and there wasn't another gate for Allegiant. Apparently they only have one gate. Cut to - my return flight from Tulsa to LAX. Was "on time" until five minutes after the flight was supposed to depart Tulsa, then the monitor changed to "delayed. Once again, for three hours. Once the flight landed in Tulsa, three hours later (our plane to take us back to Los Angeles), they announced that the flight was cancelled and was being rescheduled for the following day. No time of reschedule, no hotel vouchers. Basically, we can do nothing and we really don't care what you do until the flight is rescheduled. Oh, and by the way, go back to baggage claim to pick up your checked bags. Thanks for nothing Allegiant. You most likely lost several customers tonight. Your unreliability is just not worth the headache.

### "you get what you pay for"
2 round trip flights with Allegiant where all four flights have been delayed between 1.5 to 7 hours. My last flight was delayed two hours because they "had forgotten to fill out some paperwork". Engine was fine, landing gear was fine, paperwork was the reason all the passengers boarded half an hour late and took off two hours later. I received a notification that my flight had been delayed while I had already been on the aircraft for an hour and a half. After all that, all food was still for purchase only. I was livid, and it would be okay if this was a one time thing. It has now happened on 4/4 flights. They better keep this airline cheap, because that's really the only thing that ever keeps anyone coming back to fly with Allegiant. You get what you pay for, but if you pay just a little bit more, the quality of service is 100x better.

### "definitely use them again"
Newark to Savannah. Allegiant Air is a very good budget airline. As you would expect, you will pay extra for even carry-on bags, but since that's known, the net final payment for a round trip ticket was really quite good. What we also got (a very pleasant surprise( was good legroom. I am 6' 6", with a 36" inseam - this was a really comfortable seat and there was plenty of room between my knees and the seatback in front of me. Our round-trip, Newark to Savannah, was really good and on-time. We'll definitely use them again!

### "hats off to hard working employees"
Grand Rapids to Fort Lauderdale. I just reached my final Florida destination via Allegiant Air. I believe other postings of Flight 1729 gives a pretty good description of a New Years Eve we will never forget. I believe I take another view on how the crew on the flight and the ground crew handled this event. First if the captain refused to question the inspection we may not be here to complain. The crew did hand out snacks and juice to drink. They used what they had, and kept their stress under control considering the flack they had to endure. We needed to add fuel, because the captain kept the engines running to maintain our comfort. Our cell phones were receiving updates all evening our flight was resumed the next day. Trust me by the time we got to the hotel Allegiant Air put us up in we managed to only get 3 hrs sleep. But the ground crew returned the next morning to check us in, with less sleep. Our compensation $100.00 voucher was not adequate. So hats off to hard working employees of Allegiant Air Grand Rapids. However management missed it opportunity to make it right to all of us on Flight 1729.

### "is not family friendly"
Punta Gorda to Rickenbacker. Allegiant Air is not family friendly and staff don't seem to know FAA regulations. It started with the gate agent in Punta Gorda who tried to close boarding 30 minutes prior to departure as I was heating my infant's bottle 10 feet from the gate. She threatened to close the door on me and my family, even though it says they don't close boarding until 15 mins prior to departure. She continued to verbally threaten me for the 5 minutes it took to heat the bottle, which still left us boarding 25 mins prior to departure. Once we boarded the plane, a flight attendant tried to tell us that we couldn't have 2 car seats in the same row on the same side of the aisle, even though regulations say you can as long as the adult sits in the aisle seat. They continued to have us move the car seat 2 more times, once across the aisle and then they decided that wasn't good enough so they asked my husband to take one of the car seats to the back of the plane and seperate our family. At this point they were claiming "weight distribution". I demanded to sit with my family, and after further insistence, I and my 2 year old were allowed to go sit with my husband and 11 month old in the back of the plane. On a flight at 7:45am on New Year's Day that was 50% empty. It was clear to me that they were simply trying to relegate us to the back of the aircraft, even though on Allegiant you pay more money for better seats that are more forward in the aircraft. And it was also clear that they either have no clue what the FAA regulations are regarding car seats, or were lying to have an excuse to move us, and I'm not sure which is worse. If you're traveling with small children, steer clear.

### "they didn't have a pilot"
Las Vegas to Billings. Flight delayed 3 times with no updates. Finally get to destination and I have been on the plane now waiting to get to our gate for 52 mins so far. I have a service dog and he has not been able to relieve himself for going on 10 hours now. All because they didn't have a pilot for our flight.

### "no more flying this airline"
Me and my wife was to fly out Friday night 12-30-16 on Allegiant Air out of Asheville North Carolina at 7:49pm and we were already checked in on line and was a priority customer with paid seats. On the way to the airport we get an alarm notice that the plane was delayed until 10:00pm. So we went to dinner. At dinner got an another notice the plane was delay until 10:30. Always so many damn delays with this airline. Already checked in we get to the airport in Asheville North Carolina at 9:10pm and now found out the Security Group shuts down at 9pm and unable to get on the plane. I will never fly this airline again. It made be cheap but damn all the delays. My longest delay so far as been 7 hours and others 3 to 4 hours. The planes are very old, seats suck. Went to use the bathroom the panel were held together with tape. So no more flying this airline. I will just pray for the ones that do.

### "flight is over 4 hours delayed"
I write this review as I sit at the gate on Flight 1729 from Grand Rapids to Fort Lauderdale on New Years Eve. The Allegiant Air flight is over 4 hours delayed and still hasn't been cleared to leave due to a mechanical issue. All the flight attendants can offer are water and M&Ms. I have asked every member of the flight crew (including the captain) who to contact about getting reimbursed or a voucher, and all they can point me to is their 1-800 customer service number. It is mindbogoling to me that an airline can get away with not delivering on their service like this. I understand weather-related delays, but this is completely the fault of Allegiant Air and it's airplane. My blood is boiling knowing that I will not be reimbursed a cent for this awful service. I will never fly with them again and would highly recommend to everyone else to avoid them at all costs as well.

### "we were delayed 5 hours on our departure"
I swore never to fly with Allegiant after experiencing a 3hr delay, stuck on the tarmack with no air conditioning and the staff could not care less. Well got sucked into a "deal" only this time we were delayed 5 hours on our departure. On our flight back we received notice that our flight was canceled and we wouldn't depart until the next day. They could do nothing for us but a $100 voucher. Had to spend $600 on different airlines to come home.

### "in line for an hour"
Orlando Sanford to Allentown with Allegiant Air. Not good. Waiting to find out why my flight was cancelled just a few hours before boarding. Weather is clear but I've been in line for an hour and it hasn't moved. I've also been on hold for 23 minutes and counting on ther 'customer service' line and havent talked to anyone yet - Ill leave another review if they redeem themselves from this mess.

### "Allegiant Air left me stranded"
Plattsburg to Orlando. Allegiant Air left me stranded with my 4 month old baby the week of Christmas. My flight home was cancelled two hours before departure and they offered no other flights for 3-5 days. My family had to drive 6 hours away to get my husband home so he wouldn't lose his job, while I had no choice but to wait days for the next flight as he got the very last seat to FL with Allegiant. We couldn't afford another airline and spent our baby's first Christmas with her grandparents. We will not fly with Allegiant Air again.

### "sorry excuse for an airline"
New Orleans to Tampa Bay. I'm so disappointed with this sorry excuse for an airline, I don't even know where to begin. I'm honestly surprised they are still in business. We got to the airport and there were three desk assistants, only one had the slightest clue as to how to assist customers. The other two just seemed to be there for decoration. The flight was pushed back twice and then finally canceled. Everyone was told to go to the desk to get hotel and food vouchers and rearrange flight. The crew could not tell us where we would be staying for the evening, nor when we would be able to fly out, so we weren't comfortable making our own accommodations in the event it was an early morning departure. We waited and we waited at 11 at night with absolutely no information. When one man demanded some information and voiced the ridiculousness of the situation, they called security on him. Then there were so many people being sent to the same hotel, we had to wait over an hour in line for a shuttle. We were told it was just across the street. We finally took a cab. 38 bucks later, it was not just across the street. When we finally made it to the hotel, it was pandemonium. It was like a scene from the twilight zone. Allegiant, your company and it affiliates are an embarrassment to our consumer driven economy.

### "avoid this airline like the plague"
My family and I were supposed to travel from the Phoenix-Mesa to Idaho Falls, Idaho. Our flight was scheduled as On Time and without delays, but after we boarded we were told to disembark because, according to the flight attendant, the de-icer truck in Idaho Falls wasn't working. We waited in the airport for 1.5 hours before we were told to board the plane again. Everyone boarded and waited on the plane an additional 45 minutes until the pilot said the de-icer truck in Idaho Falls still wasn't working. We disembarked again and this time most of the passengers were anxious for a better explanation. An Alegiant worker finally admitted that the de-icer truck in Idaho Falls hadn't been working for a few days and two Allegiant planes were already stranded in Idaho Falls. Many passengers were frustrated, but all the passengers were told to just leave because no one at the airport could answer any questions. There were people who had to get to work the next day and kids were crying because they couldn't spend Christmas with family that night- including my 10 year-old. What I don't understand is, if the de-icer in Idaho Falls hadn't been working and planes were already stranded there, why weren't we notified before we arrived at the airport? Anyway, I called a number an Allegiant worker had written on a small piece of paper and I waited on hold for over 30 minutes before my wife discovered the number I was given was a generic number. Allegiant couldn't even give me a good number to call, so that I could resolve this issue. After hanging up and calling a different number I was ultimately told the next flight was four days away. I argued for a refund and was given that, including a refund of all the nickel and dime charges Allegiant gets you with (at least the refund was a plus). Avoid this airline like the plague unless you can be very flexible with your time and you are willing to put up with inferior customer service in order to save a buck.

### "the worst flight experience"
Baltimore to Atlanta. The worst flight experience in all of my 48 years! Upon check-in, only one person was able to check people in and the other 3 people were clueless. After finally getting checked in, we headed down to the gate at which point we were told that my son could not fly, as he was an unaccompanied minor and his destination was heavy with fog. No apologies, only "go back to the ticket counter to rebook a flight. The next flight to Georgia is in 3 days! Fine. We took the flight, four days with his dad is better than none. What about his luggage? We were told to wait at luggage carousel 11. An hour after the flight left we got his luggage. According to one of the agents, they were grossly short-staffed so our bag had to sit on the tarmac and wait for one of their available employees to pick it up. Unbelievable.

### "Allegiant staff were rude"
My mother and I flew Allegiant Airlines over Christmas 2016 from the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway airport to Las Vegas, and while the check-in process at the Gateway airport was very easy and pleasant, the rest of the experience was far from it. The flight was first delayed from 1.45pm until 6.30pm, and then was delayed yet again around 6.30pm until 7.30pm, but it did not board until 8.30pm. Allegiant staff were rude or would simply ignore the passengers on board the flight, ignored any flight attendant call button requests they received in favor of chatting to one another at the front of the plane, and the plane itself seemed to be ready to fall apart. Furthermore, after so many delays one might expect complimentary water or non-alcoholic beverage service, but none was provided. You would be better off spending the money booking a flight with a reliable, more customer friendly airline.

### "rude flight attendants"
Austin to Pittsburgh with Allegiant Air. Where do I even begin? Rude flight attendants, delays for who knows what, finally get aboard and sit around for 45 min. Arrive home 3 hours later than previously scheduled, toilet was dirty, first flight very hot and so many passengers complaining all at once - I see why. No wonder I only fly Southwest when given the choice.

### "still managed to disappoint"
Cincinnati to Newark. The initial advertised price does not reflect any available seats. I can buy a ticket but if I want to have a seat it is going to cost extra. They charge $50 per bag (this includes your first bag) to use the overhead bin. The seats were new but did not adjust at all. I understand that they are a bargain basement airline so I wasn't expecting any extras but they still managed to disappoint. Their ticket was advertised about $100 cheaper, ended up being $45 cheaper after their nickel and diming, but in the future I would be willing to pay the $100 premium not to fly with them.

### "my travel plans were completely ruined"
I will never fly with Allegiant again. I have flown with this airline before and had minimal problems other than uncomfortable seating and delayed boarding and takeoff, until today. I was told that I would not be allowed to board my flight. To my surprise, my flight had a weather advisory that I was never notified about and Allegiant had restrictions on minors flying alone on flights with weather advisories. So, after driving two hours to get to the airport and assuming that my flight would go smoothly because of the notification on my electronic boarding pass that said "ON TIME," my travel plans were completely ruined. The airline was in no way willing to negotiate, we were not even able to sign a waiver. At least 10 people were kicked off of the flight and forced to reschedule or find a completely different flight. Allegiant allowed me to reschedule my flight for four days later, but this was still inconvenient.

### "never been more uncomfortable"
Concord, NC to Orlando/Sanford. I have flown this twice in the past month. As a veteran flyer I can safely say that I have never been more uncomfortable on a flight. The seats on the plane are molded plastic with no capability of reclining, very thin, hard padding and packed so closely that my knees literally touched the seat in front of me the entire flight. I was so uncomfortable that my back started hurting before we even started taxiing. Add to this the constant added charges, checked bags, carry-on bags, selecting your own seat, printing boarding passes etc make it very frustrating to even try to book a flight. Then, they don't even offer a free cup of water on the flight. Any food or drinks are overly expensive and must be paid for by credit card. The attendants, while not rude, weren't exactly pleasant to communicate with. The only good things I can say is  the price of the ticket, if you get away without all the extra charges, is very inexpensive, and the location of the terminals is a bit easier to get around in than the larger international airports like Charlotte or Orlando. I usually enjoy air travel, but in this case I definitely make an exception.

### "no qualms about flying Allegiant again"
I flew roundtrip Phoenix to Springfield. I was nervous to fly Allegiant given many of the other reviews, but we had no problems. To describe this airline as no frills would be an understatement, but I was only looking to get from Point A to Point B, and they did the job. I don't understand the reviews complaining about getting nickeled and dimed. That is the business model. You pay a low fare for the ticket. If you want to sit in a specific seat or with a group, or if you want to bring a bag, you have to pay extra. They aren't screwing you - if you bother to do a little research, you can make an informed decision. Service is a little lacking, and the planes are a little shopworn, but I would have no qualms about flying Allegiant again.

### "we should be able to sit together"
If we purchase tickets together we should be able to sit together. However Allegiant would rather scam you out of more money to change your seat just so you can sit with the people you are vacationing with. I would understand if the tickets were purchased separately, but they were not. The flights were not full so there is no valid reasoning for this other than to scam people out if more money. This is the 2nd bad experience I have had with Allegiant Air and I can't think of any good reason to fly with them again. They advertise to be a cheap flight, which if it wasn't for all the hidden costs would be true. The attendents at the gate were extremely rude when we left Las Vegas. A trip should be relaxing, all of it was except dealing with this airline and their rude attendants. Flight 496 to Des Moines from Vegas 12/9/16. They even try to charge $5 for printing a piece of paper. Last time I went to Vegas my flight got delayed after we were already boarded because we were waiting for one passenger. Said passenger got on, we started to leave and then we had to pull back in just to let her off because she was too intoxicated. This left all passengers on the plane in 105 degree weather for an hour and a half. But yet I cant get a seat next to the person I'm flying with without paying another $100 round trip when they had 40 open seats on the aircraft for our return flight.

### "terrible, unreliable airline"
Sanford to Rockford. Terrible, unreliable airline. Boarded our plane nearly an hour late with no explanation, only to sit on the plane for an hour to find out the plane is broken! After deboarding the broken plane (an issue which Allegiant is apparently known for because of older aircraft), we were directed off the plane with no further instruction. Eventually they redirected us to another gate and another plane, which was out of fuel. After further waiting on the runway (this plane didn't even have air conditioning even though we were in Orlando), we eventually left over 2 hours after our planned departure time. They left passengers largely uninformed through the entire debacle, and didn't offer any apology. Would never recommend this airline to anyone who had to get somewhere in any timely manner, and God help you if you have a connecting flight! While waiting to board I met some of the other passengers on my flight who had similar complaints about the airline. No one had any positive feedback on Allegiant.

### "the worst airline by far"
Allegiant Air is the worst airline by far. My nephew was to fly home from Los Angeles to Medford. The airline has a policy that under 18 cannot fly if a weather advisory. Knowing this, I asked if I would be notified for an advisory prior to arrival. I checked the flight status prior to leaving and was listed as on time, no email or calls of an advisory. Drove the two hours to LAX and was told due to an advisory that he could not fly, and I could try again in four days. Calling the customer support I was told they could only talk to my nephew because they considered him an adult, and he would have to make reservation changes. Wow, ironic they will not let him fly alone but is responsible enough to make reservation changes.

### "will never fly with them again"
Punta Gorda to Asheville with Allegiant Air. This airline is terrible - have flown with them 3 times and will never fly with them again. Cost us more money due to delays, being re-routed, having to rent cars, hotels etc. Staff unfriendly, rude, disheveled looking and lacking in communication. The planes have been dirty inside. They charge you for everything - I will never recommend this airline to anyone.

### "terrible customer service"
Akron to Fort Myers. Allegiant Air cancelled my flight because it chose to cancel service from my local airport. Despite multiple calls and emails, I have been unable to get my fare refunded. I encounter waits of 30 minutes or more each time I call. Terrible customer service.

### "hope next trip is as smooth"
Flight from Knoxville to Vegas was very smooth. I did not see much difference flying with Allegiant Air versus the major airlines including Delta and United. The major difference is their pricing tier. It seems with Alligent everything is separate charges and other airlines one charge. This gives the concept of nickel and diming consumers. I did like the direct flight. I have booked another flight for next year. I did pay extra to pick my seat and others may not need to do this. I like extra leg room and willing to pay. Hope next trip is as smooth.

### "nothing bad to say"
St. Pete–Clearwater to Tri-Cities Regional Airport. Nothing bad to say about this airline, very friendly staff. Pilot was outstanding, very friendly, entertaining, made you feel comfortable in putting your life in his hands! Love the prices! I live in Florida, Tampa area and my children/grandchildren are in VA; Tri City area and Richmond - no problem jumping on a plane for a long weekend visit, with no changing planes! Will continue to use Allegiant. People who are complaining about having to pay for seat, luggage, ticket - compare to what other airlines charge with the reminder of changing planes just about every time you fly!

### "I might try them again"
First time using Allegiant from Punta Gorda FL. to Asheville NC. Flew out last Friday of October 2016. Nice flight to Asheville. We had planned on return flight 7 days later First Friday of Nov 2016. Because we needed to fly back 2 days earlier we got no refund for our Friday ticket and we both had to purchase 2 new tickets at a cost of double what the Friday ticket cost us. Maybe all airlines do this because of last minute changes? Flight back Wednesday was 1 hour late due to weather in Asheville. It started out to be a good deal for under 300 for 2 people round trip. Well after we had to buy the double priced tickets to get home, we could have flew any airline out there. You live you learn. If you are flying somewhere and want to fly cheap, Don't pick your seat, don't pack a suitcase and save that fee. I might try them again - just got rubbed the wrong way with the early flight back at a 150% extra fee. The staff and crew were very nice.

### "the value for money is excellent"
Cincinnati to Baltimore. Allegiant Air is awesome. Their presence at CVG opens up many opportunities to fly nonstop on a limited budget or limited time. One hour in the air versus one day of driving saves me one day of PTO, or a vacation one day longer. I'm a very frequent flier on several airlines, and the value for money with Allegiant is excellent. I prefer a la carte pricing. Since I'm normally carry-on-only, I don't want to pay for someone else's checked luggage, but I'm more than happy to pay a little extra for legroom and priority boarding - both of which were well worth the money. I skipped to the front of the line while checking my bag (the $6 I paid for priority boarding includes priority check-in / bag check), and had enormous legroom in my seat. Frequent flier hack: I found that I could get a cheaper international ticket on a mainline airline out of Washington DC than I could via anywhere in Ohio so I took Allegiant to BWI, then continued on from there to England. Saved $500 that way! On discount airlines (Frontier/Allegiant), I always tip the flight attendants, they are very grateful, and I never go thirsty.

### "I'll grin and bear it to save money"
Albuquerque to Los Angeles return with Allegiant Air. Review their policies before you head to the airport. Checking in at the counter will cost an additional $5 each way. I downloaded the app which worked well for passes and only had a personal item. The prices cannot be beat. I saved $300 over competitors. The flights were on time. Service was bizarre. Flight attendants wore ripped jeans, and were completely disinterested in providing service. Seats are uncomfortable, but I acknowledge I am 6'3 so flying is usually not a joy for me. For the short 1.5 hour flight, it is passable, especially for a fraction of the price of other airlines. Allegiant uses the low cost terminal at LAX, which is terminal 3. No TSA pre-check lane, with long lines. You get what you pay for which is fine. I have booked several more trips with them, because of their cost, but am prepared to be squished. Overall, the interactions with crew were unprofessional, but I'll grin and bear it to save money.

### "customer service is appalling"
Cheap flight, and direct from Austin to Albuquerque with Allegiant Air. Southwest is the only other airline doing that and they are way more expensive. Allegiant is cheap, but their customer service is appalling. Try their phone help and you have a half hour wait at least. Why was I calling customer service? Because I purchased a flexible, refundable fare (upcharge, of course) which I had to then cancel. But my account was not credited and the next time I flew with them the credit was not applied. I don't know if I'll ever see the refund.

### "staff were rude and unfriendly"
Harrisburg to Orlando/Sanford with Allegiant Air. This is the worst airline I've ever been on. Flight landed over 45 mins ago and we're still waiting on our luggage. They nickel and dime you through the whole process. It cost more for our baggage then it for the tickets. Staff were rude and unfriendly. We will never fly this airline again. I'm sticking with Southwest.

### "definitely recommend flying them"
Orlando Sanford to Greenville-Spartanburg. First off, I did a dumb thing and booked our flight backwards. I called and they switched it with no problem for the cost of the difference of the tickets and did not charge the change fee. Second, we went down to Orlando when Hurricane Matthew hit. We did not want to stay during the hurricane since we have a four year old and a one year old who would have been scared to death. I was afraid for our safety as well. Allegiant switched the flight free of charge. We were able to fly out safe and sound quite literally right before the storm hit. All flights had been canceled after 10. We were supposed to fly out at 7:20, but the pilots had been delayed. We flew out at 11 and thankfully had little turbulence. I definitely recommend flying them again!

### "savings are not worth the hassle"
My family and I were traveling from Orlando to Roanoke with Allegiant Air. We got there 2 hours before takeoff. In total we were waiting at the airport 6 hours. They delayed the flight 3 times in 1 hour increments before finally canceling the flight. No one at the airline had any information about what was happening and some of the workers were just making it up as they went along. The savings are not worth the hassle. I'm hearing from everyone around this area that this happens once a week.

### "very happy with everything"
Syracuse to Fort Lauderdale with Allegiant Air. After reading the reviews here I was skeptical but given the direct flight and price I decided to take a chance. I was very happy with everything. The weight limit for suitcases was less than other airlines at only 40 pounds and you need to indicate in advance how much checked and carry on items you are bringing and pay for them. Although I paid for carry on I didn't see anyone checking this. You need to print your boarding pass in advance or they charge you $5 at the airport per person. The flight boarded on time and was turned around quickly. They board from the back forward unless you buy priority boarding. I paid for the premium economy seat and it was comfortable. They don't recline but they start out partially reclined so it was comfortable and there was decent room. It was an older plane retrofitted but I was happy with it. I would recommend this airline and I would fly them again. In Europe many of the discount airlines have similar policies so you need to read the fine print and follow their rules but all in all, a good airline, great to fly direct and great price. It's no frills though. No TV, no wifi. But for a short direct flight its worth the trade off. Hopefully they will get wifi on the flights in the future.

### "one of the flight crew turned it in to lost and found"
My wife and I flew out of Grand Island Nebraska to Las Vegas on Friday September 23rd 2016 for the weekend. We had previously printed boarding passes so all we had left to do was go through security prior to boarding. The Flight was actually a little ahead of schedule on that day. Flight attendants were very friendly. We arrived in Las Vegas a few minutes ahead of time, took a cab to hotel. This is where my wife went into panic mode as she could not find her wallet. I contacted the airline, which took 45 minutes before someone actually answered the phone to report a missing wallet. I also contacted the airport as well and filed a report with the Las Vegas police. The wallet contained a substantial amount of money, drivers license and credit card. More than 2 weeks went by with no information on the lost wallet. On October 7th I received a phone call from Allegiant Air headquarters notifying me that the wallet was found. I applaud the flight crew on that particular flight out of Grand Island as the wallet slipped out of my wifes carry-on and one of the flight crew turned it in to lost and found with Allegiant Air. Here's the best part - Money, credit card and drivers license were all intact.

### "fares look good at first"
Tulsa to Las Vegas round trip. Never again will I fly Allegiant. When we returned to Tulsa from Las Vegas we had to sit in the plane on the tarmac for 2.5 hours before they let us off. Something about the plane at the gate had to have a tire changed. In this time they served us a 1/4 cup of nuts and a 1/2 cup of warm water. We sat on the tarmac longer than our flight was. The fares look good at first - until the "add-ons" start. Just fly Southwest.

### "how dirty these planes were"
Flew to Jacksonville, FL from Pittsburgh, PA and then back a few days later. You definitely get what you pay for with this airline. Staff were friendly. Flight down left over an hour late due to a maintenance issue with the flight attendants touch screen TV. During this period passengers couldn't get up. However, the flight crew came and went as they pleased. Plane was extremely dirty. Food crumbs and dirt all over the floors. Flight attendants warned us all to make sure the water was working properly before we used the bathroom. No free drinks or snacks. No wifi or XM to listen to. Flight back was on time. Staff were extremely friendly. This plane was just as dirty as the first one. Even the flight attendants were talking to each other about how dirty these planes were. You definitely get what you pay for with this cheap airline. Save yourself the hassle and spend a few extra dollars to have a clean and comfortable ride.

### "putrid, inacceptable service"
Fort Lauderdale to Plattsburgh. We were stuck with hurricane Matthew while on a ship. They sent us an email telling us that our flights were cancelled and will not be replaced. They promised a credit within 72 hours. Email sent october 4th, no credit yet. Because they are impossible to reach, I booked a flight from where the ship rerouted us (FLL instead of SFB which was the cancelled ticket) while expecting the first flight to be refunded. Dont try to call them ever: I have spent 1h 45 minutes waiting on line without answer. They dont have a toll free number for customer service and when you call their number, it is a loop where I am convinced, no one is at the other end. They charge for everything, which if you calculate, it may end up costing you more that a real airline. The airport and inflight personnel are fine. The flight went well, but putrid, inacceptable service.

### "this airline should be the last choice"
Gates agents very helpful and attentive. Good news stops there, the plane was dirty, several air vents would not shut off. One flight attendant jammed a plastic cup over one that wouldn't shut off and a passenger complained about. The flight attendants were nothing to brag on at all. The youngest one was very rude. It was obvious none of them liked ther job. We flew one way because our American flight canceled and only two options were an American flight 10 hours later and the Allegiant flight. This airline should be the last choice.

### "8 delays, not one less than 3 hours"
St Petersburg to Syracuse with Allegiant Air. I have been flying for over 40 years regularly and this is by far the worst airline I have ever experienced. They have a direct flight from Syracuse to St Petersburg, after the first couple times of 4 to 6 hour delays we thought we'd give it one more try (the only other non-stop is out of Rochester an hour and a half away). We are currently stuck in St Petersburg Clearwater Airport with another six hour delay. Again the reason was mechanical. The weather is perfect throughout the United States today so they could not use that excuse. We are waiting for a plane from somewhere else to take us to Syracuse. They do not even know where the plane is coming from so we cannot check the status. We are 0 for 4 on round trip bookings! That's 8 delays. Not one delay less than 3 hours! We will drive over an hour to Rochester take Southwest Airlines direct flight to Tampa and return Southwest to Rochester and drive over an hour to home. Inconvenient but makes me feel better that this airline will never get a dime from me again. Also we have been lied to so many times I will never remember them all. Do not book on this airline please.

### "7 hours in delays"
Boise to Las Vegas return with Allegiant Air. Without a doubt the worst flights I have ever been on. Boise to Vegas: flight delayed 2 hours. We were not offered refreshments for 2 hours and when finally offered it was only tap water. Vegas to Boise: flight delayed for 5 hours. The only thing we were offered as we waited from 4:20 to 9:30 was some awesome room temperature water and soda. Plus we got an $8 meal voucher. Other airlines may be more expensive, but the extra cost is more than worth the hassle Allegiant will put you through. 7 hours in delays and having to miss work, or $50 extra for a better experience - literally speaks for itself.

### "I have seen a change in the airline"
I have flown Allegiant multiple times in the past because they have multiple flights from Sioux Falls, SD (which has limited options of flights as a small city) to large hubs which can get me pretty much anywhere I want to go. Over the last year I have seen a change in the airline and mood of the staff. They have gone from very friendly and customer orientated to more of a second class airline where the customers are treated like cattle. I have felt better about myself and customer service standing at line in McDonalds. They claim they have low rates, but when you actually get through ticket registration they have so many fees they add up to their competitors. I understand they have a bottom line to protect, but I would rather have an airline be upfront and honest with me. For example, I tried to put my personal item (which was a very full backpack, as I had two laptops in there for a business trip) in an overhead bin. I was one of the last ones on the plane and the flight attendant told me I couldn't put it in there as I didn't pay for the storage space and I had to keep it in front of me. Even though there were open spaces and no one else boarding the plane. I will personally never fly this airline again as they are not cheaper than there competitors and they are far less customer orientated than other flights in their price range.

### "thank you to those two women"
On September 11, we left Pittsburgh to Punta Cana, an hour and a half late. During the flight (#7000) I experienced low blood sugar. The head flight attendant and the attendant working with her at the front of the plane, did everything they could and everything that I asked to get me through the episode. I thanked them at the end of the flight, for all they did, but I just wanted to go public with my sincere thank you to those two women.

### "staff have always been courteous"
Orlando Sanford to St Louis. I fly Allegiant at least 4 times a year and fly my children and grandchildren on Allegiant when they come to visit. I also recommend Allegiant to family and friends who come to visit as well. I usually pay at least half of what the major airlines charge and that includes my checked baggage. I have only encountered one long delay and that was when I flew to Memphis. We were offered an $8 voucher for a bite to eat and $50 off our next flight. Quite frankly I did not expect that but pleased with the offer. The seats are not plush but are not uncomfortable either and my flights are usually no longer than 2 hours. The seats could use some extra padding but I am thankful they do not recline - it is a definite plus not to have the person in front of you practically lying on your lap. I am happy with paying under $200 for a round trip and $2.00 for a soda instead of getting a free soda and snack and paying over $400 for the ticket. The staff have always been courteous and try to accommodate passengers. My biggest concern is safety and pleased to report every take off and landing has been smooth. Since Allegiant flies out of smaller airports there is far less congestion and waiting.

### "never again will I fly Allegiant"
You get what you pay for. Never again will I fly Allegiant. Checked in online on 7/3 for a 7/4 flight with my 8-year-old son. Got a text at 11:30pm that night that the flight was cancelled. They offered no additional information and it was impossible to get through to anyone on the phone. I finally had to purchase two tickets on Southwest to get home the next day. When they finally rebooked me, it was for a flight late in the day on the 5th so we'd miss 4th of July. Additionally it took them 2.5 hours to provide any kind of flight information - by then I had already spent $800 on rebooking. Never again. Yes, Allegiant is cheaper than any other airline, but there's a reason for that.

### "shocked by just how horrible the flight was"
Flew from Rockford to Las Vegas. When American announced that it was getting rid of its MD-80 series planes, I knew it was time for the old jets to go but would miss them. When Allegiant took possession, they took those nice, old style first class seats, along with the rest of the seats, and crammed cheap, flimsy and narrow pieces of plastic where they used to be. Having never flown Allegiant, I was shocked by just how horrible the flight was. Instead of "if we can make your flight better, let us know," the prevailing message was "our job is to talk down to you," as they so politely mentioned how their job was to keep us safe, not comfortable, prior to takeoff, in addition to giving an intercom lecture on alcohol use. Giving a vendor a discount on a few tickets got me to Vegas, but the most important thing was a lesson on how to never fly Allegiant.

### "never fly Allegiant again"
Greenville SC to Clearwater FL. Flight was scheduled to depart at 8:30 pm and arrive at 10pm. Enrolled in text notifications, in the event the flight was delayed. Got to the airport and flight was "on time". Before boarding time, was informed from allegiant employee working on the tarmac, that the plane was still in Clearwater and should be departing in 15 minutes. They were hopeful to have us out by 10pm. The great news...you get a"free" water, coke or sprite! At 1045 we boarded and we're on our way to florida. The flight arrived at 12:30 a.m. Heading back to Greenville today. Flight scheduled to depart at 6pm. Was informed it would be about 15 minutes late. 15 minutes later was informed it was headed to Orlando to refuel and would be in around 45 minutes later. 5 minutes after that announcement was informed it would be about 2 more hours. I will never fly Allegiant again. This also happened to my daughter in July. Both ways for her as well.

### "good value for the money"
Fort Lauderdale to Asheville. I fly Allegiant monthly and recommend it. The website has made improvements and once one becomes accustomed to it, booking is easy. One problem is customer service via phone. Very difficult to get through. Flights in the early am are least likely to be delayed. It's a good value for the money.

### "economical value flight"
Orlando to Richmond. Can't beat the price! Only complaint is cost for bags should be round trip if have round trip ticket, not per flight. Economical value flight, not luxury. Pilots and staff friendly. Fly to smaller airports, which depending on trip, can be more of a hassle. As much leg room as other airlines. Will fly again.

### "smallest seats I have ever seen"
Indianapolis to Las Vegas with Allegiant Air. I tried this airline for a week trip to Las Vegas. The price was good so why not. Just as I was ready to leave for the airport a message pops up on my phone that the plane was delayed 3 hours. I was still at home so just sat back down and watched TV. Second, on the way to the airport I got another message that the plane is further delayed another hour. Since I was most of the way there I just went on and waited in the airport. Finally the plane arrived and I was boarded for the 3.5 hour flight to Las Vegas. A big guy came to sit next to me. These seats are the smallest seats I have ever seen on an airplane. He spread out over his seat and 1/3 of mine. I thought I will just recline and sleep on the way to Vegas. Wrong, the seats don't recline. They are mostly hard plastic and not well padded (I could feel the supports in my back). This was the 3.5 hour flight from hell. I didn't look forward to getting on that plane at the end of the week to get back home. If you want to pick your seat you have to pay $24 each way for that. And if you have more than a personal item they charge you another $45 for a carry on and even more for a checked bag. There is no free drink service on these flights. They charge you for everything. I booked my rental car though the airline when I was purchasing my ticket and paid for it with the ticket. When I picked up the car at the rental company they also charged me $51 for something with no explanation. I could have waited and bought the rental at Las Vegas for what I paid the airline and this extra charge. never again. So, here I am at the end of the week ready to fly back home. I'm at the airport waiting 10 minutes before the boarding time when they tell everyone that there is a 90 minute delay due to a crew member that isn't there. About 60 minutes into this delay they finally start boarding and after everyone has boarded we sit there and sit there another 40 minutes. I asked what we were waiting on and was told the flight crew member was still not there. Finally about after another 10 minutes this girl come strolling on the plane as if nothing is wrong. They finally push the plane away and we leave for the uneventful 3.5 hour flight home.

### "wish I had read the reviews"
Los Angeles to Honolulu with Allegiant Air. No seats recline on the plane. They charge for carry on. Charge for everything - water, cokes, food, nothing is free. No internet. No movies. How do you have a plane where not one seat reclines on a 5 hour flight? Flight attendants do nothing except try to sell you food and drinks. Will never fly them after this. We asked for wheelchair assistance at end of flight but they had none - another airline helped us and got us that help. Again, how hard can this be when you request it with your tickets? We were lucky that we were on time going. Wish I had read the reviews before and would have paid more for another airline.

### "worst designed, uncomfortable seat"
Missoula to Los Angeles with Allegiant Air. I appreciate low fare airlines to a point. That point was reached on my last round trip with Allegiant Air. The flight was fine. The service was fine. The landing was perfection. The only problem is the seat. The seat was something I've never seen on an airplane until now. It was without any doubt the worst designed, uncomfortable "seat" I've ever sat in and I'm not overweight. It consisted of a metal shell wrapped in vinyl with a little over 1 inch of padding. The seat itself was no more than 2 inches thick and it was stationary, i.e. did not recline. Because of the minimal padding and it being a preformed metal shell, the seat did not conform to those ranging in various heights. Someone say 5'7 probably "fit" better that someone over 6 feet, etc. The back of the seat had no "pocket" to put any of your personal items, like reading glasses or a bottle of water. The arm rest was this tiny little arm about 8 inches in length and an inch in width, essentially a joke. In short, you couldn't design something worse if you tried and there's absolutely no way I could last on a cross country flight being tortured in that seat. You would think seat comfort would still be high on the list when deciding to cut services and charge more for everything (including 5 bucks for a boarding pass) in the airline industry today. Think again. I now firmly believe most airlines could care less about customer satisfaction, period.

### "my last flight with them"
This airline is about the worst I have flown. Surprisingly, I have flown them multiple times. Each experience is getting worse and worse. Please do yourselves a favor and reserve with another airline. I have been falsely accused of smoking in the bathroom (turns out it was someone at the back of the plane and in a completely different bathroom). The flight attendants quietly apologized to me and admitted they did not understand the ventilation system on the plane. The apology was quiet, the accusation most defiantly was not. The last three trips have either been delayed by over three hours or cancelled completely. I was informed of the cancelled flight at 1 am. They did not offer a reason or a possible resolution to their error until at least 9 am the next morning. The fix you ask? To fly out 36 hours later. The airline is cheap and has round trips from Grand Rapids to Phoenix with no layovers. That is the only reason I have stayed. That will be my last flight with them. It is also important to point out that all the delays and cancellations are because on airplane issues from landing gears to engine problems. Consider this as well when deciding to choose this airline.

### "seats are cramped and old"
Allegiant Air are the worst airline I have ever flown. Flew from Asheville to Punta Gorda. They charge for everything, even a cup of water. The planes are in poor shape hence the constant reviews about long delays, flight cancellations, etc. Seats are cramped and old. They lost my bag for a hour at Asheville airport after a direct flight. I went to the customer service desk twice and no one would go to look for my bag. Finally when I was irate, the girl ran off and it appeared in two minutes. If you're going strictly to try to save money with no regard to time that can be lost to delays, then enjoy.

### "by far the worst trip"
Flew Eugene, Oregon to Mesa, Arizona. Worst airline I have ever travelled on. I have seen and travelled through most of the world, from East to West and this was by far the worst trip. I cannot believe how horrible the service and staff are. Both flights on my round trip were delayed immensely and my return flight was delayed by an hour on the hour for 5 hours before they cancelled my flight. I would never recommend or fly Allegiant Air again.

### "need to be customer focused"
The trip from Myrtle to Harrisburg was delayed for over 1 hour. The trip from Harrisburg back to Myrtle that was supposed to leave at 1058 is still delayed - supposedly until they can get a plane here at 3.45 pm. There are no options to transfer to another airline or route. Only excuse is they are a budget airline with no extra resources. I will never fly this airline again and would not recommend them to anyone. They do not save you money they charge for everything even a diet coke. They need to be customer focused and provide reliable service.

### "attendants were nice and very helpful"
Flew from Pittsburgh to Myrtle Beach. My husband and I were first time flyers and glad we picked Allegiant. The flight attendants were nice and very helpful. The airline was on time going and when we came home. The airline rates were great as well. We will definitely fly with Allegiant again for our next vacation.

### "forced to sit on plane for 5 hours"
My nieces ages, 13 and 15 were flying back home from Las Vegas to Iowa by themselves after visiting family in Oregon. There was a storm in Iowa so their flight was redirected to south or north Dakota. They were forced to sit on the plane for 5 hours. With no phone, food, or drinks. The flight attendants refused to give them any food or water. Even after they got in the air because they have no complimentary drinks or snacks. Obviously 13 and 15 year olds do not have credit or debit cards, and they do not accept cash. My nieces were starving and thirsty. There is a law that passengers are only allowed to sit on the plane for 2 hours without moving. Five hours is just ridiculous, especially for kids. And then to refuse water and food. Could they really not have made an exception for a couple of kids? Given them a water, or pretzels, something? !

### "terrible customer service"
Las Vegas to Rapid City. Pretty outrageous costs for checked baggage and cabin baggage but I guess I can handle this. The thing that annoyed me was the checkin process. My partner and I had booked flights in the same booking and when proceeding to check in both on the app or at the airport, we were seated separated from each other, unless we paid a fee of $12 USD each to pick a seat. We checked in very early and it would have been easy to just put us together but they wouldn't do it at the counter unless we paid. To me, this is extremely disappointing and terrible customer service.

### "highly impressed and grateful"
Indianapolis to Punta Gorda. I traveled with my two and four year old and my two year old was a mess on the flight. All of the flight attendants went above and beyond to help me in any way they could. I am highly impressed and grateful.

### "definitely fly with them again"
Las Vegas to Wichita.I was flying with my 18 year old son who has only flown once. We knew the airline has a reputation for being delayed, but it was ok since I didn't have a small child and had the time and patience to wait. The flight from Las Vegas to Wichita was on time and a wonderful flight. On our way from a small town outside of a Wichita (an hour away)when returning to Las Vegas, we didn't know until we got to the airport (2 hours prior as told to do) we found out our flight was delayed 2 hours. That's ok, like I said, we had time to wait. The gate representative told us they had food vouchers for us, which we used. Then they made an announcement that the flight had been canceled due to problems with our plane and they had no other planes to come get us. They offered us a hotel voucher for the night and a shuttle to get us there. All staff was apologetic and understanding, which made it easier to stomach. We knew within an hour when our flight would be going out, which was the next day (a Tuesday when they don't even fly out on Tuesdays) at the same time. We got to the airport and checked our bag and they price our boarding passes since we couldn't access them online. They gave us more.food vouchers, gave us vouchers for another flight discount within the year, remembered me from the day before and moved us along expeditiously AND the costly snacks and beverages on the plane were free to all! I understand things happen and I appreciate them not putting my son and I on a broken plane. But they were gracious and sincere about what a problem this may be to some. But they made up for it with the vouchers and discounts without someone demanding this. I will definitely fly with them again!

### "9 hours at the airport"
Santa Maria to Las Vegas with Allegiant Air. Got to the airport around 12:30 pm to get on a flight which was to board at 1:19pm. Plane was put on delay til 4:10pm. Then again, then again. The plane finally showed up around 8 PM. By the time we left it was close to 9pm. Almost 9 hours at the airport. You would think they wouldn't charge for beverages after that on the flight, but they did. They charge for every little thing. Wasted a whole day. I understand occasionally things happen, but from what I understand this is a common thing for Allegiant. Not to mention, the night before our flight going to Santa Maria, not knowing any better I called Allegiant directly to request wheelchairs for my grandparents. After waiting on hold for almost an hour, I was finally connected to someone, who immediately hung up on me before I could utter a word. Terrible airline.

### "communication is horrible"
Springfield to Sanford/Orlando with Allegiant Air. We scheduled a trip right before going back to school for my family and 30 minutes before we left our house for the airport, we got a message our flight had been cancelled. Not delayed, cancelled. With no explanation, we didn't know what was next. So we called Allegiant and waited on the line for 45 minutes. Finally, an unfriendly person answered and said she couldn't tell us if or when the flight would be rescheduled, but that it probably would the next day. Since our trip was already a quick one, that cut it down another day (without even being sure about when we would leave), so we opted for the refund. 9 days later and we still have not received our refund. Tried calling again to ask about the refund and waited on the line 30 minutes and gave up. Their communication is horrible. It is also frustrating because it left us with no time to schedule another trip. They gave us $100 vouchers to fly again, but no viable options to use them before summer break ends. Vouchers will probably go to waste because I'm not sure I want to depend on them again.

### "will never recommend this airline"
Dayton to Sanford. I booked my tickets via the Internet. One for myself and one for my niece who is five years old. I brought with me her birth certificate, social security card, and a written letter from her parents so that she could board the plane. We went to Allegiants front desk at the Sanford airport and they checked us in, only asking for my ID and no further questions. Next we went through security where they only checked my ID. So I have an unidentified child with me. Not to mention the repeated 5hr delays. I will never recommend this airline. I guess you get what you pay for which isn't much. Do not plan a connecting flight after Allegiant, you will not make it on time.

### "total lack of communication"
I understand that mechanical and weather delays can be a part of the travel experience, but I have flown with Allegiant about 5-6 times and not once have I had a flight that has gotten me to my destination on time, or even close to a timely fashion. This particular experience our flight to Billings from Las Vegas was set to leave at 10.00 am, it was delayed again and again in two hour increments until we finally got word that our flight had been cancelled at around 5.00 pm and had been boarded and deplaned twice. Total lack of communication between everyone and we had similar problems to Vegas. We were lucky compared to others who had to cancel other bookings. Do yourself a favor, spend the extra money on a reliable airline and save yourself all the stress. The flight attendants and pilot were phenomenal thoughout this entire nightmare and seemed to be just as sick of it all as we were, although we did get some snarky remarks from the staff at the desk at our gate after people started comolaining about being deplaned twice.

### "all seats got switched around"
We are getting ready to board a flight from Sanford, Florida to Bloomington, IL. We checked in last night & were assigned row 23 with all 3 family members together. When we got to the check-in we noticed that we got bumped back to rows 28 & 29. We mentioned something to the guy at the counter & he said they needed to downgrade us on the plane so all seats got switched around. I mentioned I really hate being in the back of the plane & he let me know it wasnt the back. I mentioned it was three rows from it & (again empathy at its best) well its not the back. He also said we are all still together which we are not. I have a fear of enclosed spaces & being towards the back of the plane. 5 or so rows might not seem like a lot to a ticket agent or being in separate rows but they could at least have a bit more empathy & customer service. Why have early check-in if you are going to move us around anyways?! Not impressed with Allegiant Air at all. As I am writing this post my husband went to talk with the agent at the gate & she was fabulous. We are not all together but I have a seat in row 6 now. Thank you Rebollo & my husband!

### "very likely fly them again"
Jacksonville to Memphis. I was a little nervous after some of the reviews, but my first experience with Allegiant wasn't bad. Tickets were inexpensive. Allegiant is for those who want to simply get from Point A to Point B for the best price. Our check in bag weighed less than 40 pounds so we did not have to pay extra for that. We printed our boarding passes at home so we did not have to pay the fee to print them there. We had 2 backpacks we took on that we kept under our seats and checked in our one suitcase. Seats were comfortable to me. On flight food and drink - yeah you have to pay and originally we didn't plan on it, but $2.00 for a soda was perfectly reasonable and the Kids Snack Pack was $5.00 and it came with a pin. My son loved it. As much as we saved with the flight ticket prices, 9 bucks for 2 sodas and a kids meal pack wasn't bad at all. Check in attendants, pilot and flight attendants were friendly. Our flight was delayed but only by about 20 minutes. No major issues. Will very likely fly them again.

### "never could talk to someone"
Allegiant Air from Springfield to Sanford return. Our flight to Florida was fine. Our flight back to Missouri never happened. Flight was scheduled to leave at 9:00 AM. We were at Disney and had a car service picking us up at 5:30 AM. At 2:30 AM we receive a text from Allegiant saying our flight has been cancelled and to call customer service. No other information is given. So, it is 2:30 AM we scramble to cancel our car service which we got charged for. We are at Disney and it is not like you can just stay an extra night. We called 4 times on hold for over 30 minutes each time and never could talk to someone. We had no idea when or if another flight would be scheduled so we ended up booking a flight home with another airline. It was not until 4:00 PM the following day we received an email stating our new flight would be departing at 7:30 pm. They literally gave us 3 hours notice, but never sent boarding passes. Luckily we were already home by now. I finally spoke to customer service at 6:00 pm to notify them we would not be needed our seats and see if I could get a refund. They did not even have us scheduled on the flight! So, we would have gotten to the airport expecting to get a flight home, but nothing. They did refund our fee for our trip back, but nothing else. I will gladly pay higher fees with another airline!

### "forget the money you save"
Elmira to Orlando. We fly back and forth from Florida to NY several times a year and have learned our lesson the hard way. Forget the money you save, if any. They advertise better prices, but by time you select seats and pay for any and all luggage, you aren't saving anything. Even with "Trip Flex" (for an extra $75) for insurance on your flight they will not reimburse your lost expenses even if they cancel the flight. As in previous reviews, cancelations by them are due to "crew or mechanical" issues. They offer vouches for future flights, but forget any money back on the trip you have planned now and they limit he time you have to use it, so hope you have lots of vacation time. You also get no reimbursement if you need to change your flight, even within their guidelines, again you get vouchers for money off a future flight. Forget getting ahold of anyone at the call center, minimum wait times on hold are 30 minutes and I've sat on hold for over an hour, about a flight they canceled only to have the call ended...and call back in and wait again. You will also be treated with a an "oh well, we don't care" attitude that they have messed up your plans or trip. They've already got your money, and obviously do not care about customer service. We booked over a dozen flights last year between Florida and NY. 3 with Allegiant and the rest another airline. Two of our flights with Allegiant had issues, with them cancelling. One of our flights with another airline had issues due to weather. The more reputable airline bent over backwards to get us on a flight with another airline to make our destination , late but at least the same day, they also negotiated for us to get a decent rate on the last minute flight, actually saving us money, and refunded our money for the complete flight booked with them even though we used the return portion!

### "first and last experience with Allegiant"
Their motto should be "our fares are cheap so we don't care if you enjoy the flight". This was my first and last experience with Allegiant Air. I booked a one way reservation departing Pittsburgh and arriving at Punta Gorda, scheduled take off at 2:11pm. The online check in advertised as "skip the lines" is a joke because you still have to check your luggage at the ticket counter - where two people are staffed to assist a line of 100+ passengers. At 1:15, passengers who had the mobile app received text messages stating that the flight was delayed until 4:40. Passengers who did not have the app were confused because the screens at the gate and the mobile app itself did not reflect the delay. There was no Allegiant Air representative at the gate to provide clarification, so after 2:11 came and went, it was obvious that the delay was legit. At 3:30, an Allegiant air rep arrived at the gate and announced that our plane was due to land at 4:30, and that everybody needed to hurry up and board the plane after the passengers were released. At 4:00 the Allegiant attendant announced for everyone to "be quiet and listen up" because the plane was going to be a little later because of "storms" - and suggested that we look at weather radar to confirm the weather patterns. The plane landed at 5:00, and we were told that they needed to clean the plane before boarding. At 5:20 they started boarding special needs and priority passengers and told every one else not to get in line until their zone was called. Once they called for zone two, where people had already started lining up, an attendant again reminded us to "be quiet and listen up" and then said that we needed to hurry up and start boarding or else the flight would be canceled(?). They also told passengers for the flight to Orlando that was currently posted at our gate, that they needed to go to an alternate gate. A few of us brought it to representatives attention that the posted flight and time for Orlando on the screens were showing that it was departing from our gate, we were told that they didn't have anyone to change the information - so of course people who arrived at the gate after the announcement boarded the plane (oddly, not discovered at the gate by the attendants), and further delayed our take off as they were removed after everyone else was seated. Then at 5:45, the captain apologized for the delay, citing that they had some mechanical problems in Myrtle Beach (weren't the delays caused by "storms"? The Allegiant rep even emphasized that we validate the presence of storms on the radar, guess that was a little white lie). Then the captain started yapping something about the fact that if we weren't airborne in exactly 15 minutes, the legal flight hours for the pilots would be exceeded and they would have to cancel the flight. We literally lifted off with one minute to spare, and the cabin actually erupted with passengers clapping and saying how bad this airline was.

### "negative reviews were unfounded"
Tulsa to New Orleans. I just completed flight 1 of a 2 flight trip. I spent time reading many Allegiant reviews just before boarding, and I can say the negative reviews were unfounded. I boarded the plane, flew to my destination and disembarked. It met my minimal expectations, I got that for which I paid. Job well done. The flight was delayed 30-45 mins but I was informed of that before I left my house. As other reviews have indicated this is an ala carte experience. Anything beyond getting a seat on the plane will cost you. Read website info carefully to minimize extra charges. We did experience some charges but still a very reasonable cost. I will make a return flight in a few days and provide an update.

### "better than previous trip"
Kalispell to Las Vegas with Allegiant Air. Better than my previous trip. Both flights were on time. Flight from Kalispell was actually a charter plane (Sun Country) as Allegiant had no planes available. This meant no beverage or snack service was available on the flight. Return flight was on time and we ran into no issues. I do hate the nickle and dime attitude of the airline (paying for carry on luggage, paying to print a boarding pass etc) but they got me where I was going at the time promised. Plane was reasonably comfortable. Staff friendly enough but could use some customer service training. They preferred to spend time chatting amongst themselves at the front of the plane as opposed to serving passengers.

### "Allegiant is a horrible airline"
Our last 2 flights from Sioux Falls to Las Vegas have been canceled. The first time they told us there was no crew and the 2nd the excuse was mechanical issues. In both situations we couldn't leave until the following day. We were given $100 vouchers which sort of traps you into feeling like need to book with them again to use it but it's not worth it. As already mentioned in several reviews the cost incurred from their totally unreliable service generally exceeds the money you think you are saving when you buy their tickets--even with the $100 voucher. We're out over $600 between our hotel room and show tickets for a show we can't attend now because our rescheduled flight the day after we were supposed to leave doesn't take off until 6pm--if it actually ends up leaving at all. It seems to be a real crap shoot. In talking with others at the airport nearly everyone had stories of being burned by flight cancellations. Allegiant has no concern for the fact they are destroying vacation plans that in most cases people have been looking forward to for months. Bottom line is that Allegiant is a horrible airline that sells you tickets for services they can't provide.

### "never fly Allegiant again"
I flew on Allegiant to Medford Oregon 10 days ago. Got to the airport to go home to phoenix today (July 29) and after and hour of waiting we were told that our flight had been canceled and was not going to be rescheduled. You buy tickets on and airline and cant get back home. Now we are scrambling to find other flights and of course they all cost hundreds of dollars because they are last min. Everything is booked, Allegiant says the soonest they have a flight back home is Friday - 7 days later. What about our jobs, where do we stay, and Allegiant says they are sorry and thats it. They are giving us a refund on our return flight and 150 dollar voucher to fly with them again. No way its costing me 700 dollars to get home. I will never fly Allegiant again. Allegiant has a lot to do if they are going to make it. This has been a very frustrating experience. Found out our plane was being used for another Allegiant flight that was delayed. Guess they just dont care about the people in Medford.

### "I do not recommend it"
Albuquerque to Austin. The flight was supposed to leave at 3:50 and didn't get notified until 4:15 that there were maintenance issues and that the flight would be delayed. There were no updates and all further notification was done through text messages. The flight got delayed a few more times until about 6:30 when we were told the flight would be cancelled. All they did was give us business cards to call the customer service hotline. It took 2 hours to get ahold of someone to get my money back. Found out later that there was a power outage on the flight which resulted in a small fire. I do not recommend it.

### "the biggest nightmare ever"
Las Vegas to Reno. I am actually unsure of where to start. This was the biggest nightmare ever. I showed up for my flight two hours early. When I got my gate there were upset people everywhere. There were two flights that had been there all day waiting for their plane to board and leave. I was flying to meet my husband in Reno. Our plane was supposed to take of at 6:15. It was 7pm and we hadn't even heard anything yet. When they finally told us something they said our plane was still in Great Falls and should be there in two hours. They gave us all meal vouchers for 8 dollars - everything was closed and seriously 8 dollars? So we waited two hours where they then announced "The plane still hasn't left due to mechanical issues, we are working very hard to have another plane to get everyone taken care of, please be patient. We have a plan - we just don't know what the plan is yet". We literally all started laughing. This went on for hours. They would not give us a straight answer on anything. They kept us all there until midnight where they then canceled the flight and said it would fly out the next day but didn't know which time. Also they had already put all our luggage on a broken down plane (why?) so we all had to wait another hour and half to get our check ins off. They offered everyone 300 dollars for a room. No rooms were available at midnight Friday night in Las Vegas. So over 20 people spent the night at the airport. If you live within 60 miles of the airport they don't reimburse you for the hotel and they pay your hotel within 6 months. Also, the plane was so gross they don't clean them before the next flight - I had peanuts at my feet and gum in my magazine.

### "that'll be the last time"
McGhee Tyson to Las Vegas. Purchased 2 roundtrip tix back in January 2016 as Allegiant announced new nonstop service from our little airport. Made all our necessary reservations for our vacation including hotels in Las Vegas, Zion Lodge, LaJolla CA and our last night at LAS airport before our flight home. At 2:00 am on the day of our scheduled departure I received a TXT from Allegiant that our flight for that day as well as our return flight a week later had been cancelled. Checked the website sure enough flight says cancelled. No other information, just cancelled. And they only fly on Mondays and Fridays from TYS to LAS so it's not like we have any alternatives. So immediately I begin to think about all of the other reservations I needed to cancel before I get charged for not showing up. 1st night hotel is prepaid non-refundable: $200 lost, next 2 nights at Zion Lodge already past the cancellation deadline by 1 day - $500 lost, La Jolla I lose the first night deposit $300 lost, luckily can cancel by last night at airport. Also cancelled my rental car. So for a cheap flight I lost approximately $1000 in other charges. So much for that exciting "non-stop" announcement from TYS-LAS. I would never recommend this airline to anyone because of this. Allegiant - you suckered me once, but that'll be the last time!

### "10 flights, 10 delays"
I have flown Allegiant about 10 times. Each time, the plane has a "maintenance issue" and we have been stuck in the plane for several hours while waiting for them to repair or wait for paperwork to document repairs. My last flight from Greensboro to St. Petersburg, we were in the plane for about 5 hours before we were able to take off. They did not allow us to use the restroom or move about the cabin. On my flight home from the same trip, I experienced the exact same thing. Unbelievable. Will never fly Allegiant Air again. 10 flights, 10 delays. Spend the extra money on a real airline. Not worth the savings.

### "spend that extra money on a good airline"
Horrible first time experience. Our flight from Las Vegas to Sioux Falls, SD was first delayed Sunday, July 24. We were told that we were waiting on the captain. Then they didn't know where he was. After sitting on the plane for 45 min, we all had to exit because the internal temperature of the plane had risen too much and was not safe, supposedly due to all of the bodies on board. Once off the plane, there were rumors it could take 2 hours or more, or possibly not even until the morning, before we were able to leave. Then it was announced it would take 20 minutes to half hour and it should be cooled off enough for us to safely board. After an hour, we were told we could board again. Once we were on and all seated, they told us 1) Some people didn't come back on, so they had to reevaluate for weight, and 2) There wasn't enough fuel to get us to South Dakota, so we had to go to Mesa, Arizona to fuel up. Once in the air, a loud, piercing shrill started up. Damage your ears loud and high pitched. The entire hour to Mesa, AZ. They announced over the loudspeaker that they knew about the noise and would be looking into it once we landed. Once we started descending, the noise stopped. When we landed, they started handing out small cups of complimentary ice water. We asked if we needed to worry about the internal temperature rising again while we waited, since that was the problem in Vegas. We were told by a stewardess that we "weren't being held hostage, that we could get off at any time, but they couldn't make any promises that we would be able to get back on. After a little while, we noticed people taking our baggage off the plane and tossing it onto carts. Turns out we were going to be boarding a different plane anyway, they needed to take ours for a test run to find out the cause of the problem. When we got into the small airport at Mesa, AZ, their little shop with snacks wasn't open. We just assumed it was so they could charge us $3 for M&M's or $5 for a Snack Pack on the flight. Moral of the story, folks, if you want to feel just a little safer while flying and have flight attendants that aren't so rude, don't fly Allegiant. Save up, spend that extra money on a good airline. The seats don't recline, there isn't much leg room, and you pay extra for everything.

### "no issues on either flight"
We flew from Kansas City to St. Petersburg, FL and then back. We had absolutely no issues on either flight. Both flights were on time. I was impressed with the comfortable seating (better than Southwest in my opinion). I was very skeptical to book this airline after reading all of the negative reviews of delays and cancellations so I wanted to add a very positive review. One thing I can tell you is that I have a friend that did experience a delay from Kansas City to FL but she was given vouchers for a hotel stay and food. So maybe they are improving in that regard (not sure). I will surely fly again. Unbeatable price, great seating, great staff, great pilot, great trip! They also had great options for snacks in my opinion. Yes, they do cost extra. However, I did see others bringing their own snacks aboard.

### "will never fly Allegiant again"
Los Angeles to Tulsa. The flight was cancelled and rescheduled 24 hours later. The airline sent a text at around 1ish am for a 9 something morning flight. I called the airline and was on hold for 40 minutes before I talked to an agent. I was told the flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues. The agent was polite and explained that since they are an independent airline, they cannot put me on another airline so I could get to my final destination (which is what typically happens when a flight is cancelled with other airlines). I tried to make the best of the situation and accepted I was staying in LA one more day. Luckily, I was staying with family, so I didn't spend extra $$ on transportation and lodging. The following day, we boarded the rescheduled flight and ended up getting delayed for almost 2 hours, while we were inside the plane! They had 24 hours to fix the mechanical issues and yet continued to be bombarded with more! The poor flight attendant ended up having to do her "fasten seatbelt" shpiel at least 3 times before the plane was fixed and the door was closed. At one point, one Allegiant employee made a joke about "inflight entertainment" which no one appreciated! They kept telling us we were taking off in just a few minutes - meanwhile, almost 2 hours later, we hadn't left nor the doors closed!! They gave us vouchers each for the cancelled flight but I will never fly Allegiant again. I thought I was saving money and yet, it cost me one day's worth of lost wages. Should have flown with another airline.

### "I would not recommend Allegiant Air"
We spent our 16 wedding anniversary in Las Vegas airport. Being the responsible adults that we are, we arrived 2 hours early for our 2:15 flight from Vegas to Tulsa. Our flight was delayed at least 4 times (I lost count). We were told that the delays were due to a non-functioning external a/c unit that was supposed to keep the plane cool in-between flights. They told us that it ran for at least an hour before anyone noticed the problem. The plane was sitting in Vegas sunlight in 114 degree weather without a/c. In addition to the delays, we experienced 1 aborted take off (plane had physically left the ground, but pilot had to abort and take us back due to an air speed sensor malfunction) after having set on the tarmac for 1.5 hours without a/c. A second boarding during which we set on the tarmac for 2 hours without a/c. While we were sitting in a sweltering plane some of the passengers voiced their frustration. The pilot then got on the speaker and threatened all passengers with an air marshal if we did not keep our opinions to ourselves. This was after he told us all via the speaker that this was "just one of those nights. We started down the runway this time and never even got to attempt take off due to one of the blinds reportedly coming off a window. We were deplaned a 2nd time and told that our flight was cancelled. The staff waiting at the gate informed us at that point that we passengers should begin looking for our own hotel accommodations. They would not assist us in any fashion. Allegiant Air would reimburse us up to $300 for the hotel, and will reportedly reimburse us for transportation to/from the airport. They estimated that we would get out reimbursement in 5-7 days. Keep in mind that this is Vegas, on a weekend and it was now after 11 p.m. We couldn't find a room under $300, so we are now losing $$ through no fault of our own. I also had to cancel our reservation in Tulsa, which was now outside of the "no penalty/no charge" window. I spent a lot of time pleading my case not to be charged for a room that we would now be unable to use. For our troubles, we were given $8 meal vouchers and a $100 credit towards future Allegiant Air flights?! $8 doesn't buy a meal at Vegas airport. And we will not be flying with that airline again - that credit is useless. We understand that things happen, but the nonchalant and at times downright rude attitude of their staff just put an even more bitter taste in my mouth. Long story short, I would not recommend Allegiant Air to anyone.

### "flight was completely cancelled"
We were to depart from Tulsa to LAX at 7:20pm, per recommendaion by Allegiant Air, we were there at 5pm. As soon as we reached the terminal, we were informed of an hour delay. No big deal, we could wait. Apparently there was "aircraft maintenance" and some planes had to be switched around. Of course, as someone who travels frequently, this is understandable. What's not understandable is how we went through 3 delays, until they finally told us a final departure time at 1:45am. The airline brought in pizza and refreshments, just to settle us down. Then, at midnight, an announcement was made by a very snarky associate who informed us that the flight was completely cancelled. This made us lose 300$ car rental and hotel reservations. So, since the pilots were "timed out" they told us to get a hotel if we were more than 15 miles away, because they did not have a certain time for us to come back the next day and said they "would email us". We were sprawled around the airport at this time, some of us sleeping, and we came to the counter to ask questions. We still don't know when our flight will happen. We would normally cancel, but this trip is necessary to see family.

### "worthless when always is delayed"
Indianapolis to Fort Lauderdale with Allegiant Air and I'm stuck at IND. I'm a frequent weekend traveler from Lousville to Fort Lauderdale on Delta or American, I was trying to save around $150 flying Allegiant, but it ended up worthless since this airline always is delayed, going back to major airlines.

### "nickel and diming the not so savvy traveler"
Springfield to Las Vegas with Allegiant Air. Departing flight 45 mins late. Departing plane had only one functioning lavatory. Loudest cabins in the airline industry. Return flight delayed 3 hrs and counting due to the plane allegedly having no functioning lavatory. According to the terminal attendant, "We won't be taking the original plane. They just haven't found another plane yet. Nickel and diming the not so savvy traveler with bag fees for every situation imaginable. I'm glad my wife and me educated ourselves about Allegiant's policies beforehand. Don't be a victim. Handful of Wheat Thins - there's a charge for that. If you're going cheap, go Southwest if possible. Work a few more hours to make up the $100-200 cost difference - it's still far and away the better affordable airline.

### "disappointed nearly every time"
Des Moines to Las Vegas. Allegiant Air has cancelled the past 3 consecutive flights. We fly frequently between Las Vegas and Iowa, and are disappointed nearly every time we fly Allegiant. In fact, we are surprised when things actually go smoothly and on-time. We continued to choose them because of their direct flights to smaller Iowa locations, hoping that the service would improve. But when we have to book hotels or postpone plans because of cancelled and delayed flights, that benefit no longer outweighs the negatives. If this had only happened once or twice, I wouldn't bother reviewing this. But between our family and my extended family in Iowa, this is 7 delays or cancelled flights within 2 years and that's beyond acceptable.

### "still stuck at the terminal"
The Allegiant Air flight from Shreveport to Las Vegas was scheduled to depart at 1.30pm cst. After sitting on the plane without air for over an hour the staff provided us with a drink. They were not able to explain what was going on. They allowed us to go back into the airport until they determined what was going on. It is now 4.40pm cst and we are still stuck at the terminal. I tried to reach customer service but I was on hold for over an hour. I will never use this airline again.

### "no information provided"
Today is my first experience with Allegiant Air and I was a bit skeptical after reading some other bad reviews before booking my ticket. This morning, our plane took to the runway for an on time departure from St. Petersburg to Bangor, only to have to slam on the brakes on departure due to a mechanical issue. Just what you like to hear. We have now deboarded the plane and have been waiting in the terminal with no information provided. Seats are stiff as boards, with half of the space of other airline economy tickets. This will be my first and last time ever flying Allegiant.

### "such a stressful experience"
My flight was cancelled without explanation for Monday July 11, 2016 and no reschedule flight offered. I was on the phone for over an hour trying to talk to someone about flights and other accommodations. Finally someone answered only offered refund for my flight back home and $150 voucher each for me and my companion. No hotel accommodations weren't available. Also I couldn't not fight a flight to get back home not until Thursday or Friday, because flights were all booked. We both already missed a day of work, so I had to book with Allegiant again to fly somewhere else to get me closer to home. So I booked flights to Harrisburg.Pa then rented a car to drive to Niagara airport to get my car that was parked there. Then finally we had to drop renter car in Buffalo Airport and was able to head home afterwards. This was such a stressful experience. I needed to get back home to my kids and work. The other flights like Southwest , AirTran and Jetblue were too much money to book at last minute. I am sorry to say I will not fly with Allegiant Air again !

### "Terrible experience all the way"
Las Vegas to Bellingham. The worst flying experience of my life. Started off by having flight delayed 2 hours. We had checked in online the day before, thinking we'd just quickly print boarding passes at airport, like you can with basically any other airline. Not so with Allegiant. You have to stand in line forever and pay $5 just to get it. Then our delayed boarding time comes and goes with still no plane and no info provided to us about what's going on. Many people there were there from a cancelled flight the day before. Luckily a plane did finally come after a 4 hour delay. They had overbooked it and so some that thought they had seats didn't. Plane was hot with limited air and we had to wait another hour before we even took off. Terrible experience all the way around.

### "will not fly Allegiant again"
MidAmerica St. Louis Airport to St. Pete–Clearwater. I feel like we almost got lucky that our flight delay wasn't worse after reading some other reviews. Our flight to Florida was just fine. It was delayed by 20 minutes, but everything went well. Our flight back was cancelled at liftoff time. While a completely full plane's worth of people waited, we could not locate a single Allegiant employee. There was no one in the entire terminal or on the tarmac. We received a notice by text message that the flight was cancelled, then waited in a huge line to re-book. The phone system didn't work - no human ever answered the call. We finally booked an Allegiant flight to an airport three hours from home, then rented a car. We arrived home 11 hours after our scheduled arrival. We will not fly Allegiant again, unless they get new management and get their act together.

### "delays due to aircraft maintenance "
Elmira NY to Sanford Orlando FL. We use Allegiant Air to fly to Florida for a week long vacation. Worst airline ever. Old aircraft that apparently need constant repairs because both of our flights had 2+ hour delays due to aircraft maintenance issues. This negative review in no way applies to the pilots or staff members. They were all great. They all did their jobs well. It's just that waiting in an airport for over four hours to take a flight is totally unacceptable.

### "could've driven to / from my destination"
Was scheduled to fly from Baltimore to Asheville at 5:30, then was delayed to 5:45 - no big deal right? On the way to the airport, I was notified that the plane was then delayed - this time to 10:45. 5 hour delay. Now we are delayed again, to 12:45. I could've driven to and from my destination in the time it's taken to just wait. Completely unacceptable - will never fly this airline again.

### "clean and comfortable"
This round trip flight with Allegiant Air was on time, well managed and efficient. the plane was clean and comfortable and the staff professional and polite. I have read a few complaints about this airline, but for me everything was just fine, no complaints from Punta Gorda FL to Rockford Il.

### "military strict on baggage weight"
Des Moines to St. Petersburg with Allegiant Air. I endured a 2 day weekend of nothing but delays and an eventual cancellation of flight due to mechanical issues. This wouldn’t have been so bad if I was traveling by myself, but I had a handful of kids in-tow. What good does it do to buy cheap airfare tickets if the airline cannot get one to the destination on time or even in a timely manner? This 2 day delay had a devastating ripple effect throughout my entire 7 day itinerary. It seems that this company can’t keep track of its own pilots. Allegiant flew a different plane in to DSM only to find out that the pilots were out of air time. Here is a working airplane, but no one to fly it. What kills me is that the company is military strict on checked baggage weight, but it asks flyers to open the air vents and click the seatbelts before deplaning. I have strict flying rules too. Make me unload 3 lbs. from my checked luggage into my personal carry-on at the check-in stand (on a return trip no less) and you can click your own seatbelts and close window shades behind me.

### "charge you for everything"
3rd time I've flown Allegiant. 1st time was delayed 3 hours. Second time was 1 hr. I am at the gate now and flight from St Petersburg FL to Grand Rapids is 1 hour late again. This was the first flight of the day and you would expect it to be ready. It wasnt. Next, they advertise as a budget airline. That is only because they charge you for everything. Boarding passes are $5.00. Water or soda $2.00. The cost of the flight advertised did not include taxes. After all was said and done this flight cost 25% more than standard airplanes and was late in all cases.

### "another 3 hour delay"
This was by far the worst experience I have had flying. To get started we were delayed 3.5 hours on 7/7/16 to then have our flight cancelled. We were told flight was moved to 8am on 7/8/16. No big deal except when we arrived and went through security at 7am we were told by airport staff Allegiant mechanics had not shown up and our flight crew were nowhere to be found so again we were delayed another 3 hours. You know what Allegiant did to accommodate everyone? Nothing. We got a 100 voucher for their airline but you really think anyone wants to fly with them now. So fast forwarding to 8/10 our 8.20 return flight. We get to the airport to find out all computers are down, luckily I checked in online. So for starters we expected a small delay. So at about 8.35 we get to board to then sit on the plane until 10.15 before they make everyone get off the plane. Again no accommodations. We finally board and leave at 11.20 - another 3 hour delay. I really think Allegiant needs to get it together.

### "seats were very uncomfortable"
Our flight from Las Vegas to Honolulun with Allegiant was delayed 4 hours and the airline did not provide a reason for the delay. They provided us with a food voucher for $8.00 which does not buy you much at an airport. We finally left at 10:30 PM and had to fly 6 hours in the middle of the night. We booked this flight because it was cheap and not a true "red eye". The seats on the plane were extremely uncomfortable and did not recline even though we paid extra for the seats with extra leg room. The first leg of the trip the extra leg room seats had maybe an extra 6 inches of room. The return flight extra leg room seats had much more leg room but the seats were still very uncomfortable and didn't recline. I would have been okay with the seats on a short flight, but this was a 6 hour flight. We could not sleep at all in these uncomfortable seats. The return flight back from Honolulu was also over an hour late taking off. Also on the return flight, we had to wait an hour for our luggage at the carousel. This all being said, "you get what you pay for". Cheap does not equal quality. I will probably never fly with them again, unless I have lots of time and really need to save money.

### "offered no apologies or explanation"
The flight on July 1, 2016 from Pittsburgh to St. Pete-Clearwater was fine. It left and arrived on-time. The seats are not very comfortable. They don't recline and there's not much cushioning. Staff were courteous and attentive. Flight #866 from St. Pete-Clearwater to Pittsburgh on July 4th was cancelled. I received a text telling me the flight was cancelled about 12:30 am. But I was asleep and didn't look at the text. I went to the airport thinking it was still on. The lady at the counter just said the flight was cancelled and I was on the flight tomorrow (Tuesday) at 2.40 pm. I tried to ask some questions about what to do or do I get a conformation. She dismissed me. She offered no apology for the inconvenience. She wasn't outright rude, but treated me as if I was not her first priority and should have been someone else's problem. I called the customer service number on the way back home. 32 minutes later the call was lost/disconnected. I tried again, 63 minutes later I actually spoke with someone, she was pleasant. They offered no apologies or explanation. Just a voucher for future travel with Allegiant Air. Not pleased with the whole thing.

### "cancelled flight with no explanation"
Jacksonville to Cincinnati with Allegiant Air. Over the past several months my flights with this airline have been delayed and in June my flight was cancelled. Allegiant gave everyone a $100 credit. While that's all great, it's horrible to have a cancelled flight with no explanation. Besides the cancelled flight, every single flight has been no less than 30 minutes late. Today my mother is flying to CVG from JAX delayed for 1 hour and then cancelled. Do not fly this airline if you're on a time crunch.

### "no clue about customer service"
Our return trip from Richmond to Jacksonville, flight 914 was simply cancelled. No explanation, just an email saying we should be rescheduled for the next day. When you call their number you just sit on hold, after 32 minutes, I hung up and booked through American for a small fortune. Some of us need to get back home and work. I tried calling on my flight up to Richmond a few days earlier and same thing, a ridiculous wait time. This is obviously a business that has no clue about customer service. Allegiant, unacceptable and shame on you.

### "could have driven as quickly"
Baltimore Washington to Cincinnati with Allegiant Air. Horrible - 3 hours late, plus an hour on the ground once arrived turned a 1.5 hour flight into 5.5 hours. I could have driven from DC to Cincinnati as quickly when you add in the wasted time. Terrible airplane, horrible staff, miserable communication. There is nothing good about Allegiant Air.

### "totally unconcerned about customers"
Bloomington to Cincinnati with Allegiant. Just horrible. Waited through a 4 hour delay for a 1.5 hour flight with very slow and limited information. Evidently Allegiant has 1 plane as we waited for the 1 to show up. This is an airline totally unconcerned about their customers showing a poor attitude. Do not use this airline.

### "had to find our own hotels"
After flying Allegiant from Cincinnati to Destin Florida I thought that nothing was really wrong with this airline. The plane ride to Destin Florida was great. No delays, no problem leaving the runway, the staff was very nice. Going back home was the bad part. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 7.05pm on Saturday, July 1st. The plane pulled in and everyone got their bags ready to board until someone came over the PA system saying there would be a slight delay. So we waited. We played the waiting game from 7pm to 10pm. I was told that a screw was missing from the gully and they wouldn't let us board without that screw. We waited for a maintence guy from VPS to arrive but he never showed up to fix it. So we were told that they were going to cancel the flight and put us in hotels and taxi us there. Negative. Nothing was available within a 30 mile radius from the holiday weekend and we were told we had to find our own hotels. No food was given which was awful because by the time they canceled the flight it was 10.30 and everything was closed in the airport. Most of the passengers slept on the floor for the night because no hotel rooms.

### "packed in like sardines"
Orlando Stanford to Cincinnati with Allegiant Air. They delayed my flight for 8 hours then cancelled it. They rescheduled it for the next day but they delayed it the next day. At least it left though. We were packed in like sardines and it was such a miserable flight. I couldn't wait to get off it. I also was unable to sit with my son unless I paid $40 for a seat change so we sat seperatly.

### "delayed twice for over three hours"
Allegiant Air flight from Des Moines Iowa to St Petersburg Florida was delayed twice for over three hours. Flight had delayed boarding because we we given a different plane and seat numbers were different. Didn't arrive until 12.30 in the morning. Baggage took over 45 minutes until it was on the baggage carousel, even though they were on going at most 40 yards from the plane.

### "constantly cancel or delay flights"
Mcallen to Las Vegas with Allegiant Air. They constantly cancel or delay flights. Original flight was cancelled 6 hours before departure for operational issues. I rebooked after being on the phone for 2 hours, for 2 days later and this flight was delayed for 3 hours due to personnel issues. Due to the delayed flight we arrived in Vegas at midnight and the hotel only had a small check in staff, because they didn't know about the delayed flight. It took them 2 hours to get people checked in. The hotel gave several small comps but said they couldn't do more because we had booked through Allegiant. Don't recommend them to anyone.

### "poor quality, poor communication"
Cedar Rapids to Las Vegas with Allegiant Air. Our flight from Cedar Rapids was canceled and not rescheduled due to a thunderstorm in Las Vegas? Found another flight with Allegiant the next day (on our own, with absolutely no help from Allegiant in Cedar Rapids). Drove to Peoria and this flight has now been grounded for 1 hour due to a 'lavatory backup' on a plane that has been parked here since last night. Why was the plane not cleaned out and prepped last night? We are not happy with the poor planning / maintenance and service. Management should take the courses to learn how to execute proper customer service. Super frustrated with poor quality and poor communication from Allegiant. I spent 1.5 hours on hold last night to try and figure out what to do after my flight from Cedar Rapids was cancelled and not rescheduled.

### "do not use this airline"
Las Vegas to Cedar Rapids with Allegiant Air. Completely incompetent airline. Scheduled to fly out at 3:00 completely cancelled fight at 7:00 because they couldn't find a pilot to fly the plane. Left over a hundred people without any way of getting home, or any compensation for the troubles. Said we could possibly take plane 3 days later if it wasn't full. Said to call for a refund, which took 2 hours of waiting to get through. Same thing happened on the way to Las Vegas, but paid for a cheap hotel to stay overnight. The next morning, their computer was down and took 2 more hours to get through the line. Also called to complain about losing a day vacation that the hotel was going to charge us for. This also took 2 hours to get through. Definitely got what we paid for. Warning do not use this airline.

### "flight had been cancelled"
St. Petersburg, FL to Richmond, VA with Allegiant Air. Waited without being updated for a couple of hours. Finally passengers started to get updated before the employees even knew that the flight had been cancelled and rescheduled for the following morning. We were told that we would all receive a $100 credit to use in the future. Have yet to see this credit and I've tried to call the airline customer service more than a few times only to be on hold for over an hour each time. I give up. Worst airline ever. My flight on the way to St Petersburg was also cancelled after waiting for at least 5 hours ; rescheduled for the following day. Both ways of this trip. Unreal.

### "shameful and embarrassing"
Initially, my flight to Medford was scheduled for 11.30am, but it kept getting delayed and delayed until 7.00pm. The A319 that was supposed to take us on our vacation to Medford had a mechanical failure, and wouldn't be flying us. The very helpful gate agents said a replacement aircraft (an MD83) would arrive at LAX at 4.00pm. The plane arrived on time, but we weren't allowed to board because, ironically, it needed a mechanical part before it could fly. At 7.00pm, a supervisor announced that the flight was cancelled, wouldn't be rescheduled, and no hotel vouchers would be offered. Families with young children and other travelers, myself included, spent the whole day in LAX's crowded and bland Termanil 3, only to be let down by Allegiant. It's shameful and embarrassing that an airline would leave passengers stranded, without a rescheduled flight or hotel.

### "I got what I paid for"
My 1st and 2nd impression of Allegiant Air were beyond awful. Flight from Concord to Clearwater was delayed by 4 hours. No meal tickets, no restaurants in the airport, only snack vending machines. Arrived at our destination at 1.30am. Told us our flight was coming from Kentucky at first, then they ended up coming from somewhere in Florida. Flight from Clearwater to Concord was delayed by 3 hours. This time there was a restaurant, but still no meal tickets or any compensation was given. Arrived home by 11.30pm. Gave our plane away to another flight that apparently had been waiting there for hours as well. A plane came for us finally and they told us we would be boarding soon, but then told us 30-45 minutes later that we couldn't get on that one. Then told us that another plane would come for us from Roanoke. Pilots told us on the plane that they came from Orlando. They also overbooked our flight by 6 and asked for volunteers to not fly back home that day. Offered comps for that. They either seem to lie about what's currently happening or they literally don't know what's happening. I will never fly with Allegiant again. They wasted soo much of my time that it wasn't even worth paying less along with direct flights. I guess I got what I paid for, but they need to seriously evaluate what kind of reputation they are making for themselves.

### "the vouchers are worthless"
Tulsa to Baltimore with Allegiant Air. They boarded our flight to Baltimore but noted an issue with "condensation" and had us leave the plane to wait in the boarding area. They kept us informed for a while and then communication stopped. 3 hours after we were meant to depart, the flight was cancelled. They sent us compensation vouchers an hour before the staff told us the flight was cancelled. They rescheduled us for the next day which cut our time with our granddaughter by a day. We confirmed our new flight and then an hour later received a notification that our new flight had been delayed. I have yet to "fly" with this airline but if we do make it out of Tulsa it will be a miracle. I have a feeling the vouchers are worthless.

### "Can't count on them"
Boise to Las Vegas with Allegiant Air. Flight was delayed two hours, then another two hours, then a whole day! I live two hours away, was already there ready to fly, and had to either go home or get a motel. They did provide a $100 voucher for flying again that I will never use. Would prefer a partial refund, anything else. Can't count on them.

### "your comfort doesn't matter"
Delayed Allegiant Air flight from New Orleans to St. Pete–Clearwater. Company loaded everyone onboard, closed and locked the doors, and then announced that they were waiting for a mechanic to fix the plane and that there would be an additional 45 min delay. So we sat in a hot, poorly ventilated plane on the tarmac. Why not get the plane fixed before bording and making 200 people uncomfortable. Why? Because your comfort doesn't matter with this airline. They have cut their prices so thin that they simply follow the pennies for making judgments on customer movement. If you can't afford to fly any other airline then come prepared to be late and uncomfortable. If you can afford it, go elsewhere like me.

### "delayed twice for 2.5 hours, then finally cancelled"
Las Vegas to Bellingham with Allegiant Air. My flight was delayed twice for a total of 2.5 hours, then finally cancelled. Our bags took almost 2 hours to get to the baggage claim. We received a hotel voucher and transportation but the counter staff was slow with their service and lacked professionalism, especially the manager. All told we wasted over 6 hours of our day. The final reason given was a mechanical malfunction with the air conditioning of the cabin. I see this reason has been posted quite often.

### "an hour with no air conditioning"
Rapid City to Las Vegas with Allegiant Air. Delayed leaving Rapid to Vegas 1 hour but fairly uneventful getting there. Coming home, an entirely different story. At check in we got a text notifying us of our flight being delayed from 5:30pm to 8:15pm. A flight attendant called in sick but they didn't have another one available in the hub airport of Allegiant? It was annoying but manageable. 8:15pm comes and goes and a replacement attendant is still not here. Finally at 8:45pm we board the plane and sit there. The plane is too heavy. We wait for someone to fix that. It's 104 degrees outside and now the air conditioning system isn't working. We wait for someone to fix that. It's now 100 degrees inside the aircraft and for an hour we wait with no air conditioning, not even moving air. Stifled, sticky, smelly heat. No beverages offered during that time, just good old fashioned, stick to your seat kind of fun. It was my first flight with Allegiant, and will likely be my last. It's just not worth the uncertainty of when you're actually going to get to where you're going, and the condition in which you'll be getting there.

### "not sure I will ever fly Allegiant again"
Asheville to St Petersburg-clearwater with Allegiant Air. Arrived at AVL 2hrs ahead on time and after getting thru TSA we got a text saying flight delayed. Not just slightly but 5Hrs. Did receive a meal voucher and some comp. Late getting into PIE but just beginning our vacation so we gave them the benefit. Return flight was early morning and cancelled. No reason or explanation. Due to the fact my husband and I had to return to work and no other options - last minute we had to rent a car and drive back to AVL. 12hrs. Even with vouchers I am not sure I will ever fly Allegiant again unless they make some serious changes.

### "no updates were given"
I fly weekly Thursday returning on Sunday. American Airlines increased their rates for summer travel, so I have opted to fly Allegiant to be more cost effective. My flight from Concord to St Pete was delayed. 3.5 hours. Making my arrival at 1.00 am. Because Allegiant does not fly from Concord to Punta Gorda this left me with a 3 hour drive to Southwest Florida or I should say my husband with a six hours drive round trip to pick me up. The flight returning to Concord from St. Pete was delayed again. The 6.15 was delayed until 8.00. At least that's what they are saying at the moment since I'm writing this in real time. No updates were given until 1 hour post our boarding time and they were minimal. A beautiful plane sits on the tarmac with no passengers to board. This should have been our ticket home but the plane was overbooked for the flight because the am flight was cancelled without notice. Or there could be mechanical issues who know because they don't up date you on anything.

### "no customer service"
Boise to Los Angeles with Allegiant. Horrible maintenance onboard the aircraft. Always delayed and there is no customer service to talk to or get info from. There is no counter person to answer questions and they will not help you out if your flight is cancelled. No voucher for food or hotels. Do not waste your time or money with them.

### "the inconvenience is not worth it"
Our flight to Clearwater was supposed to leave at 12.35pm. After many delays the plane finally showed up at 6pm. We lost an entire day of our vacation and no one offered any knowledge as to when the plane would show up. Allegiant flight next to ours going to Jacksonville got cancelled as well. I would not fly this airline again. You may save a little bit but the inconvenience is not worth it, you get what you pay for. Very unhappy along with a lot of others.

### "no customer service"
We flew down to St. Petersburg from Scranton with Allegiant because of the low cost and direct flight, but their planes are sub-standard, their cancellations/delays are very common, and their compensation/customer service in response to inconvenience is non-existent. Our return flight was cancelled with no notice. They didn't offer a return flight, nor any compensation to book a flight through another airline. Was on hold for 3 hours. I'm a realist and understand, but to have no customer service when things get cancelled and to have a policy of non-compensation if you book flight with other airline is ridiculous.

### "our flight is cancelled"
Flew out to St Pete Florida on June 13th and our flight was delayed with very short notice as most people were already at the airport. Today I was to fly home at 7:30 am, we got a call 2 hours before saying the flight will be delayed 3 hours (10:30 am). This means paying double transportation because you have to change your time to be picked up. Then we get to the gate and they say our flight is cancelled because there's not enough room for everyone. This means we paid transportation for nothing and we left our hotel when we could've stayed there another night instead of dealing with the hassle. The airline knew that the flight would be canceled the whole time. Now our flight is reassigned to tomororw at 3:45 pm. We did get a room voucher. Now we are trying to figure out an extended time for dog sitting ect ect. Many people upset and some missing work and weddings. Very sad for those who need to be home for events.

### "no counter service"
Both outbound and return flights were cancelled. No rebooking on other airlines "per Allegiant policy". No counter service and non-existent phone service. My family scheduled a quick weekend in Orlando and decided to try Allegiant Air (from Fargo) for the first time due to price, and the convenience of the direct flight. I received a text that the flight was cancelled just as we arrived at the Fargo airport. Mind you, they would have known the flight was cancelled long before that because their only in-bound flight would have been coming from Orlando. No reason was offered and we were given a non-toll free number to call where we sat on hold for a half-hour before being disconnected, then tried again and sat on hold for over an hour before we got to talk to somebody. We opted for the refund and purchased a last-minute, expensive ticket on another airline because we did not have calendar flexibility. Turns out that the return Allegiant flight was also cancelled. My advice: don't be tempted by the low prices.

### "delay communication virtually nonexistent"
Tulsa to Baltimore with Allegiant. Delay after delay. Unknown maintenance issues. Their communication about the issues was virtually nonexistent. Just more delays. This not only happened with our flight, but with two others. At one point the gate was filled with travelers from 3 delayed flights. You get what you pay for.

### "I should charge them!"
=They cancelled my flight to St. Pete/Clearwater Florida on the day of travel. Was on hold for over one hour. Once connected to customer care I was told my flight is "potentially rescheduled" for tomorrow. And I may be compensated $50 or $100 in a voucher (presumably to book another cancelled flight on this airline). Of course this does not take into consideration lost time at work, an extra day of travel, my pet sitter, or any other arrangements that I have in place. Reason for cancellation "operational. I originally was scheduled to fly out Friday, June 10. For family reasons, I changed the flight to an earlier departure date. Good thing because my original flight was cancelled. Of course I was charged $100+ to change my flight. How will Allegiant compensate me? Perhaps I should charge them!

### "staff is friendly enough"
My Allegiant Air flight from  Bellingham to Las Vegas was scheduled to leave at 527 pm, arrive 8:03 pm. As I arrived at the border, I received a text saying it was delayed until 9pm. Well after more than one delay, we landed in Vegas just after 3am. The delay, it seemed was due to mechanical issues. While it inconvenienced both myself and the person picking me up in Vegas, I would rather have a safe plane than attempt to be on time with a malfunctioning place. And this is not the first time I have had a delay (with other airlines). They emailed out $50 vouchers to the passengers (I haven't had an airline do that before). It's a nuisance that they charge for on board luggage, seat selection, even water, but the other airlines charge for some of those things too. They don't provide the same prices tho. The website is easy to use, and so far, of the flights I took or my friend in Vegas has taken to come up to Bellingham, this is the first incident with Allegiant. Staff is friendly enough, and I am not paying for seat selection, and coming home on the airbus, I managed to sleep a little of the way. No real complaints.

### "price great but disappointed"
Albuquerque to Las Vegas with Allegiant Air. The price was great, but we were extremely disappointed. Delayed on the way there an hour as we waited for paperwork to be signed and on the way back, we boarded the plane on time but the engine would not start. They had us in a hot airplane for about an hour and a half while they tried to figure it out. They finally gave up and we were asked to switch to a different plane which took about 30 minutes. For arrival into ABQ we were put in a holding pattern why the local air show was going on. For 40 minutes we were going in circles with a great amount of turbulence. We got to LAS airport for check-in at 7AM and arrived in ABQ at 3PM. We could have drove and been home in the same amount of time.

### "had to sit in the airport for 7 hours"
New Orleans to Pittsburgh with Allegiant Air. I had to sit in the airport for 7 hours. They kept adding and subtracting time for the wait. I don't understand why a single direct flight needed so many updates. If they had said to me it was a 7 hour delay from the start I would have come to airport later or left and come back. Communication on the status was back and forth to the point where people stopped listening after the 15th or so update.

### "not worth the hassle"
Austin to Las Vegas with Allegiant Air. The most unorganized airline I have ever dealt with. To start off we signed up for flight alerts and when we had arrived to the airport 2 hours before our flight we found out it was cancelled. We ended up spending 2 hours waiting in line (as well as on hold on the phone). By the time we got to the front of the queue we were told that there would be a flight for use the next day. We tried to reroute and work through it but customer service was impossible to work with and ended up just writing our name down. They promised they would look into it and call me when they had more information. They never called me. I also sent an email to their support, and it's been 3 days and I haven't heard anything back. In any case, the next day we show up to our flight and they did not reassign the seats, so everyone sat anywhere they wanted which displeased many passengers - myself included. Allegiant Air is not worth the hassle of saving $100. I much would rather have spent the extra money and travelled with better customer service.

### "told to wait"
Allegiant Air flight from Las Vegas to Boise. Plane had issues, had to wait on the plane for more than one hour before being "deplaned". We were told to wait for announcement at the waiting area, but announcement was a member of staff telling us that they had no information and it could be or at least two hours before more information. Avoid this airline, staff do not seem to care about their customers.

### "great service"
Flew Allegiant Air from Omaha Airport to St. Pete–Clearwater. The seat was a little uncomfortable but was great price, great service, on time, smooth flight with the usual food. Loading and unloading was quick and staff were very helpful. I would definitely recommend this airline. Cheap, direct flights are definitely worth the price.

### "seat was fairly uncomfortable"
I flew from Phoenix/Mesa Gateway airport, which is more convenient to my house to Ft Wayne, IN,. The seat was fairly uncomfortable for me, it is the newer style of carbon fiber frame and had very thin seat padding. These seats don’t recline at all, the tray tables are smaller than they used to be and you can’t put anything in the seat back other than papers. You used to be able to put a water bottle or other items in the seat pocket, but no more. This airline charges you for everything, so I’m not sure you are really saving much money on Allegiant. Refreshments cost a minimum of $2 for a can of pop. I normally barely pay that for a 12 pack of pop. Their schedule to Ft Wayne is very limited, making it harder to schedule your stay. And they don’t even fly to Ft Wayne at ALL from 8/13 to 11/15. Either you are providing service to the city or not. When the pilots gave announcements, we could not hear what he was saying because he talked so softly. I asked the people sitting in my row if they heard what he said, and they could not hear him either. On the return flight, the cabin temperature became very warm inside. I did ask the flight attendant if she could lower the temp, and apparently she did because it became slightly cooler in the cabin. Also on the return flight, after a short while the pilot turned on the seat belt sign and kept it on the entire way back. There were a few bumpy periods during this time, but not the whole way back. He could have turned it off for some of the time so people could move around a bit. I became very antsy in my seat after about 90-120 min of flight. At least the flight did leave very close to on time and arrived on time. All in all, I will check other airlines before I will schedule Allegiant again.

### "would rather have a layover and pay more"
Memphis to Jacksonville with Allegiant Air. We normally fly Delta or American, however Allegiant offered a non-stop flight to Jacksonville FL and the air fare was $75 less. We arrived at the airport at 12:30 (2 hours early as per instructions on the boarding pass). Our flight was due to leave Memphis at 2:40pm and we should have arrived in Jacksonville at approx. 5:15pm. We did not arrive in Jacksonville until after 10pm. During our lengthy stay at the airport we learned that 3 flights altogether had been delayed or cancelled and the reason given for all 3 was mechanical problems. Our return trip did not improve our opinion. Our flight was due to leave Jacksonville at 5:15pm. We did not arrive in Memphis until after 10pm and again we were told it was due to mechanical problems, and again during our stay at the airport we learned that there had been other flights that day that had been delayed by hours and hours due to mechanical problems. We will never fly Allegiant again - I would rather have a layover and pay a little bit more.

### "no customer service"
This was my 2nd time using Allegiant Air flying from El Paso TX to Las Vegas NV and unless it's my only option for a straight through flight and considerable difference in price, I will not use them again. They charge you extra for everything, there is no customer service, the aircraft is old, loud and uncomfortable.

### "terrible customer service"
St. Pete-Clearwater to Niagara Falls with Allegiant Air. Terrible customer service and unprofessional flight attendants. This airline has no idea what it is doing. Arrived at airport 1.5 hours before departure only to be notified that flight was delayed 30 minutes. Boarded aircraft 1 hour later and then took another half hour to take off. No explanation given. I paid extra money for priority boarding to stow my bag and the flight attendant then moved it back 3 rows. Unless you don't really care when you arrive or how you are treated this is the airline for you. Otherwise be prepared to get what you paid for, bad service, rude employees and total uncertainty on the time you will reach your destination. I for one have learned my lesson and will never fly this airline again.

### "experience was horrible"
Asheville to Orlando with Allegiant Air. First with this airline and the experience there and back was horrible. First flight was delayed several times and we ended up waiting all day in Asheville to have our flight cancelled at 7pm because the pilot had maxed out his fly time. On the trip back to Asheville we experienced similar events. The weather was perfect but still they continued to delay the flight every 30 mins. Currently still waiting at the airport for this flight. We will never fly with them again and I would recommend paying the extra money to get a flight you can depend on.

### "not fly this airline again"
Memphis to Jacksonville. Do not fly Allegiant Air unless you are very flexible and have the patience of Job! Flight to Memphis was changed with no notice (same day, five hours later). Called customer service and was told an email was sent day after booking regarding the change in flight times. No email was sent and another customer verified he received the same story when he called. Return flight was delayed and then cancelled. Customer service agents were rude when handing out vouchers for meals and hotel, actually acting like it was an inconvenience for them! Absolutely will not fly this airline again!

### "unfriendly to so many"
Indianapolis, Indiana to Punta Gorda. I was stopped with my emotional support dog because my boarding pass said service animal. While at the check in counter I was asked to see my paperwork from my doctor and was given the pass. The problem was I was stopped at the gate by the lady who was scanning all the passes and was asked for my paperwork again and was told that it needed to be changed in the computer there is nothing on your website for emotional support animals. As I was on the verge of tears for being stopped again and showing my paperwork; the lady at the gate was rudely telling a very pregnant women with two little children that their small stuffed animal bag was too big. The lady said that the check in counter told her she was fine. The woman was in tears. It wasn't as much as she had to pay more as she was being treated awful. While she was crying she told another lady with a child that her bag was too big too. That lady also was told at check in hers was fine. She was told that the plane could leave without her. My husband while waiting for me offered to pay for the lady's bag so she could get on the plane. Your employee was rude and disrespectful to these women. I was a nervous wreck just being there and worse after all of this occurred. This employee needs some training classes on how to work with the public and be more compassionate. I fly twice a month with Alligent and everyone is very friendly. This is the first flight that I have experienced that was unfriendly to so many.

### "be upfront about reason for delays"
I've been flying with Allegiant Air for the past couple years. My boyfriend lives in Florida and I live in Ohio, so the price that Allegiant offers is very competitive compared to other airlines. I've never been thrilled by my flights with Allegiant (inconvenient times, not a lot of flexibility, fees for bags and reservation changes that add up), but it does have its perks (affordable, small airlines so less security hassle, nonstop flights). However, the past couple of flights we have experienced multiple delays. It seems almost as if this is becoming a signature of Allegiant flights. This past flight was already inconveniently timed to fly out at 8pm and arrive at 10pm (this would be fine if there was a choice, but this was the only time available from LCK). That afternoon, the flight was delayed by 40 minutes. Annoying, but no big deal (I should mention that the airport is an hour away from my final destination, so each delay made the drive to Sarasota more and more inconvenient). Once I was at the airport (arrived early at 5:30, figured I could work on homework or read), I received a text message that the flight was delayed until 9:16pm (there was not an announcement at the airport for a while - only text messages at first). Around 9pm, we received another missive that informed us that the flight would leave at 10:56pm. The workers at the airport were not at the gate for most of this, maybe avoiding angry passengers? There were sporadic announcements to the gates. Long story short, we left at 11:30pm and arrived around 1:30am; I arrived in Sarasota around 2:45am, almost 4 hours later than I had planned. Allegiant never explained to us the reason for such a drastic delay (only made worse by the lateness of the original flight). Was it weather? The flight was flying out of Myrtle Beach and into Ohio. Was it computer issues (they seem to encounter these a lot - which only freaks me out more about the safety of the flights)? Something else? The pilot and flight attendants were all very kind on the flight, and all of the passengers were pretty complacent (no annoying irate passengers to deal with - which I appreciated). However, an explanation would have been nice. Maybe even some free food on the flight to make up for the 3 hour delay! I'm not sure if I'll be flying Allegiant again. Probably I will, because I can't afford to fly anyone else. While there are some good things about Allegiant, I still have many major issues with them. I realize that they are a discount airline and therefore the fees and inconvenient times are necessary. But please be upfront about the reason about delays, and maybe consider a way to make it up to your passengers.

### "professionalism is horrible"
Greensboro to Sanford with Allegiant Air. Our flight to Orlando was delayed 4 hours. We ended up missing our Carnival cruise leaving from Port Canaveral. When we decided to try to find plane tickets to the Bahamas to meet the ship there, Allegiant offered no help whatsoever. Carnival advised us to get a letter from Allegiant explaining that there were mechanical issues that caused the delay. We talked to several Allegiant staff and no one could print us a letter. Staff acted like they had no clue what we were talking about. We eventually resulted to asking them if they could at least print us some boarding passes with the correct time that we left so we could prove our flight was delayed but they would not do this either. Customer service was not great. In Greensboro, the woman acted like we were inconviencing her when we asked for help. Also, two staff members were cussing and joking around while we were trying to check in our bags. At Sanford, the woman at the desk kept helping other people behind us in line. Overall the professionalism of the company is horrible. I understand that issues and delays happen but the fact that no help was given is unacceptable. The staff kept brushing us off. The staff from American Airlines helped us find tickets to the Bahamas and cared more about our situation and we didn't even fly with them. All Allegiant offered us was an $8 vocher only good for that day to use on food in the airport. Needless to say, we will not be using Allegiant in the future.

### "charged me to lose my luggage"
I had flown Allegiant 3 times since October 2015. I thought for the price they were awesome. No you don't get the 4oz of soda, coffee or tea for free when flying with them, but you do save $75 to $100 by not getting that beverage. On April 9th I flew in from Florida to New Hampshire after a 10 day vacation. When I landed in Portsmouth I went right to the baggage claim area to get my luggage. I waited and waited and waited. All the luggage is gone and there are two of us standing there without ours. One of Allegiant employees was there and asked if we got our luggage. Both of us said NO. Employee called someone and said then we were told that one had fallen off the belt and it would be right up. It was the other persons not mine. After waiting a hour or so for employees to search, I was told it was no where is that airport. The employee took me to the counter and started a claim. She was very nice and I was told that I would have it FedEx to me. She said I would probably see it Monday. Well Monday came and went. The next Monday came and went. After 10 days and no news I started writing and calling. I was told they are doing everything they could and would let me know. A week later after not hearing anything I reached out again and asked if they checked Fort Lauderdale or NY. I said NY because when I was checking in my bag the counter person asked if I was going to NY. I said NH! Since that last conversation with Allegiant, I have not heard back from them. They are now ignoring my emails and phone calls. My last message left to them was asking if Luggage falls from plans, but we never hear of it. Still Waiting!! OH YA, they did sent me a email saying they apologized for any inconvenience and would be crediting the bag fee I paid. They are so sweet to refund me the bag fee, they charged me to lose my luggage. Has anyone else ever have this happen?

### "not worth the headaches"
We booked an Allegiant Air flight well in advance from Punta Gorda, FL, to Asheville, NC on May 6 to return on May 16. This trip was planned based on children’s recitals, friends’ travel plans, graduation date, and the Allegiant Airlines limited schedule. On the morning of May 6, our travel day, I received a text message, saying that our flight was cancelled and rescheduled for the next day. When I called Allegiant, the agent would give no reason for the change. The weather in Asheville, Punta Gorda and between was beautiful; most of the east coast was also nice. I believe that the flight was cancelled because there were not enough seats sold. The fact that the flight was rescheduled for the next day would foul our tight schedule that involved driving to several other locations before returning to Asheville. Besides, what would motivate us to trust that Allegiant would fly on the 7th if they weren’t flying on the 6th? They refunded my fare and car rental charges, the minimum they could do and the most that they would do. The result is that two arthritic seniors drove an extra 1400 miles and an extra 24 hours. We put 2700 miles on our car, instead of zero with the rental. This is our third attempted trip on Allegiant, with only one that went as scheduled. The cost savings is not worth the headaches (and backaches). No more!

### "a horrible experience"
I was supposed to fly with Allegiant Air from Rochester to Sanford for the first time today. A horrible experience from the beginning. Myself and my party of four boarded the plane and after a half an hour we were told the brake pressure was not where it was supposed to be. Everyone was asked to leave the plane and hour by hour we received texts saying our flight was delayed. Finally, from 12 to 5 p.m. an announcer said they were going to cancel the flight. We were given 8 dollars for food that the Rochester airline would accept and the airline refuses to refund our flight or extend it one more. I just graduated college, my traveling time is very limited. I wasted a whole day in the airport and a day of vacation because of mechanical issues that I personally think should have been checked before everyone boarded the plane. I called the customer care line twice and both ladies were rude and not helpful. Horrible experience.

### "use the alternative"
This is not the first bad experience we have had flying Allegiant. Just another straw on the camels back. These include cancelled flights, poor counter service and rudeness from the counter staff in Idaho Falls, and long delays of flights. This is a review of the customer service quality of the counter personnel at McCarran airport. First off, there is very limited times the counter is open, 3 days a week, from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM. I arrived at 10:45 and waited for 15 minutes for the woman at the counter to check in 1 person, who was already at the counter when I arrived. This spot at the counter was the only one that did not say "check in" or "bag drop", but only said "Allegiant Air". It was apparently was the priority check in line since when I approached the counter I was asked if I was priority check in. I replied no and was informed I had to wait in the long line. I explained I was not checking in, but was there to purchase tickets. She looked at the clock and it was 11:00, so she informed me that she would not sell me a ticket because it was 11:00. NOT EVEN 11:01 Are you kidding me? I wait in line while she takes her sweet time with 1 person and then won't sell me tickets because I am now too late? I guess they don't really need my business after all. If you have a viable alternative, save yourself the hassle, inconvenience, rude employees, delayed and cancelled flights, and hidden fees etc.that nickel and dime you to death so you end up paying almost the same as elsewhere, and use the alternative. Oh, and when I called customer service about this, they would be happy to book my flight over the phone for an extra $13.00 per ticket per leg. No thank you.

### "the flights were great"
Stockton to Phoenix–Mesa return with Allegiant Air. After the bad reviews I thought I would give my good review. I haven't flown in about 10 years and after reading bad reviews I was upset at myself that I didn't check before I bought. Anyway, I guess I was lucky to have no delays, the plane was on time leaving and landing round trip. The staff was great, very nice and no problems. The flights were great and I will fly with Allegiant Air again.

### "boarding process was slow"
Allegiant Air seems to get a bad rap however as someone who flies a lot and has status on other airlines I wanted to share my recent experience. This is the 2nd time I've flown Allegiant. I made my reservations with Allegiant because 1) It was half the price of the major airlines and 2) It was a direct flight from Springfield, Mo to Las Vegas. I paid extra for priority seating and carrying my bag on the plane. I printed my boarding pass off at home and then downloaded the app so I had it in my phone as well. This way I never had to deal with the counter. I always have snacks on me so the fact that you had to pay for Snacks/drinks (water too) didn't bother me. I also didn't think the seats were uncomfortable or there was a leg room issue. If you fly a lot most planes these days have decreased their legroom so for 3 hours it wasn't a big deal. My only "complaint" is that departure time seems to be a suggestion. We left about 45 minutes late. The boarding process was slow so be prepared for that. I would suggest paying the $15ish fee and get priority boarding and a seat at the front of the plane. I thought the staff were friendly and I would fly them again. I've had worse experiences with the major airlines. You just need to know what to expect.

### "unprofessional and unreliable"
Unprofessional and unreliable. Will not fly this airline again. We have flown Allegiant Airlines several times, but twice in the last month both flights were delayed and then cancelled until the next day with no explanation - weather was not an issue. Many others in line with us after the cancellation said they had several flights with Allegiant cancelled and had to stay overnight as well. Both times the flight was cancelled we stood in line for over an hour to receive a $100 voucher for a future flight. Allegiant has no extra planes to send in so you just have to stay overnight and since our flight was supposed to be at 7.15 am that means hanging out at the hotel all day unless you want to pay to rent a car. Allegiant counter staff were fairly rude and matter of fact - the man behind us had a wife graduating from college that night and was going to have to miss it. Transportation to the airport was disorganized and you had to have a receipt and send it in to get reimbursed. I don't ever post reviews but want to warn others that the discount prices of this airline aren't worth it.

### "was friendly service"
Bellingham to San Diego. I would only recommend this airline when you're flying somewhere less then 4 hours away. The legroom was ok, but the snacks were a little overpriced, there was friendly service. But flights from LAX get delayed and the airport waiting areas are not good. At Bellingham the airport is perfect.

### "no respect for customers"
Allegiant Air flight from Stewart International to St Pete–Clearwater was significantly delayed, causing day flight to be changed to red eye, which would have never been a consideration as we are traveling with a toddler. When we contacted customer service, we were not given any better options, and were denied a refund. We're trying to get to Florida for a wedding, and at this point we will arrive sooner if we were to drive from NY to Florida. Horrible service, no respect for customers.

### "crew did not show up"
We were scheduled to travel Allegiant Air from Las Vegas to Indianapolis early in the morning. We had to arrive at the airport very early. About 1/2 hour before we left our entire flight was cancelled and we were told the flight crew did not show up. They rescheduled the flight for the next day. Most people can not do this as they have limited vacation time and I had to work the next day. All we got was a refund for our flight (which I am still waiting for) and a huge hassle in trying to find another flight to get home. Do they not have backup flight attendants? We should have received a full refund of our flight and money for our time. It cost me money and time, and an exhausting all day trip home, because I had to then go to a different airline, and travel out of the way just to get home. Very disappointing.

### "it was unbelievable"
I was flying from MCI to SFB Friday evening 3pm I was at the airport 1pm got a text for delay for 6pm, 7pm, then 8pm, 9pm, 9:30pm, 10pm, 10:30pm and then at 11. I was told it was a mechanical problem then 11pm I was told the captain had exceeded his working hours. It was unbelievable. At 9pm we were offered soda. At 10pm we were offered an $8 dollar food voucher. This was ridiculous because $8 couldn't even cover the cost for sandwich, the voucher so late in the night that food in the fridge was gone. We had to get out of the terminal the only shop that was open a bagel shop and then we had to re-check in with security to come back in. The bagel shop the cashier yelled at us and refused to take the voucher until someone called an Allegiant Air personnel to talk to them. At 11:00pm they finally told use flight was cancelled they would book hotel accommodations. There are over 100 people on this flight so by the time we got our hotel accommodation we were booked the worker said they "would call the bus" to come pick us up from the airport to the hotel. Which took another 45 minutes to get us to the hotel by the time we got to hotel it was pass midnight. we were schulded to fly out next day at 10am. I was going to be very smart and beat the crowd and to get my tickets for this flight. I arrived at 6am. Only to find out that the ticket counter didn't open until two hours before the flight. So how the heck were they supposed to check in about 100 passengers onto this flight most people needed tickets printed luggage checked in and be ready by 10 o'clock for take off. I was second in line and flight didn't get started for check in until 8:15am. the captain is sitting at the boarding desk. He is also highly irritated himself trying to explain to us that he was too tired that he had worked his Max hours and could not fly the night before. how the heck is that my problem - 10 am rolls around and no one to help with boarding. I had paid for seats towards the front in row 10 bc of medical issues, but as my medical issues were not life "threatening" they told me I had to wait until Zone 5 was called - by the time my zone was called I had to sit in the back of the plane. On my way back we were delayed from 3pm to 7pm. At 6:45 the aircraft had not even arrived and we were supposed to fly out at 7pm.

### "worst trip I have ever had"
Allegiant Air from Eugene to Phoenix. Worst trip I have ever had in my life. Our flight was supposed to leave at 5:02pm. About 15 minutes from the airport I received a text that we were delayed until 5:57. No big deal I thought. About an hour and a half sitting at the airport I received another alert - flight delayed until 10:10pm. The plane was having issues. I'm all about a safe plane and was fine with it. Once finally boarded at 11:00 we were asked to get off of the plane apparently because we had been drinking. After sitting in the airport for about 7 hours we had made friends with all of the other passengers waiting to board. Still have not been given a reason why they took us off the plane. My ailing mom was waiting to pick us up and we never got to see her.

### "Never fly Allegiant Air"
Scheduled to leave from Owensboro at 7.31pm to Orlando Sanford. We received a text frpom Allegiant Air about 6pm that the flight would be delayed until 9.05pm, so we decided to go eat. Were 45 minutes from the airport. Immediately after ordering dinner we received another text that the flight would leave on time after all (Monday March 28 2016) - so we left our food and drove 80+ mph to the airport. We arrived, parked, got through TSA and immediately received a 3rd text that the flight would be delayed after all. SO we had no dinner, Owensboro Airport has no where to buy food or drinks, so we sat forever waiting, waiting. Then Allegiant decided to delay the flight again via overhead announcement. We arrived in Orlando about midnight finally and got to the hotel at 2.00am. None of this above is taking into account our 79.00 one way fare (which ended up totalling $525.00) for the two of us. Never fly Allegiant Air.

### "I will think twice"
Not sure where to begin, but while making the two hour drive to Raleigh to catch a afternoon flight to Tampa (Clearwater) Florida, the emails started that the plan was delayed for 40 minutes, several minutes later it was delay another hour and fifteen minutes then by the time I got to Raleigh it was delayed until 6:20 pm a total of 21/2 hour delay. If that was not enough, at 6:20pm the plane arrived from Tampa everyone got off and then we were notified that the flight was cancelled. Waited 2 hours for a hotel voucher and was told the hotel was right down the street. Went to get luggage and it was not available because someone had pulled it and put it in the office and went home. So here I go to the hotel that we only down the street to get there to find out that the hotel we were staying at was 10 miles out in Durham. At 11 pm I arrived at a hotel with no change of clothes or any hygiene items. I had heard a lot of good things about Allegiant but I am beginning to wonder and will think twice before I make any further reservations with your airline.

### "treat their customers horribly"
After several attempts to stay connected online and with customer service via phone we purchased three remaining seats $1643.26. Sent a letter to customer service to verify what was said to me on the phone call concerning Nut allergies and seating children with parents. Was told by a travel representation that nut allergies are taken very seriously and children are never separated from a parent. Boarded our flight, the flight attendants that day denied alerting the passengers of my 9 year olds nut allergy. Said that have him deal with it and place him by the window. Into the flight they began selling snacks containing Peanuts and Tree Nuts. My son became ill, administered more antihistamines and received zero assistance from the flight crew. There was a nurse onboard who came to our aide. Hindsight is 20/20 I wish I would have read the airline reviews before purchasing our seats. Please take the time to read the Allegiant customer comments on how horribly they treat their customers. They are sponsored with The Make A Wish foundation who help grant the wishes of courageous children with life threatening conditions. A complete contradiction to what was given to my son March 11th flight 845.

### "didn't have any issues"
Flew Pittsburgh to Sanford with Allegiant Air. Got the ticket for a good price and didn't have any issues with them. Carry on fee was an ok price. The only downside to the flight was that the seats were not very comfortable. If I was flying for longer than 2 hours I would probably go with another airline. The seats didnt recline and were on the smaller side. But all in all not too bad.

### "never seems worth the money"
Fresno to Las Vegas. Allegiant delayed the flight twice and left at least two passengers I'm aware of at security because no one was at the check in desk for them to get boarding passes. I barely made it on the flight despite that issue only because I had my boarding pass downloaded on the app already. No one was there to check my bag and they refused to send anyone out to the desk to help those two people, one of which came right after me. Allegiant has a reputation for being late, yet they wouldn't help passengers who were a measly 5 min late after they'd delayed the flight twice by 3 hours. They don't even offer water complimentary on their flights anymore. I've flown Allegiant several times and the stress you have to put up with, outrageous costs for carry on bags, seat selection, etc. never seems worth the money.

### "never got my money back"
Clearwater to Niagara Falls. I paid an additional fee so that I could sit next to a window as I am claustrophobic. The aircraft was changed to a smaller size at the last minute therefore rearranging the seating plan. I was switched to a middle seat (with a lap child), and despite my begging and pleading they did not give me a window seat. I paid for it! I never got my money back. The seats don't recline, aircraft was visibly dirty and messy. They have delays and cancellations because of mechanical issues.

### "realistic in your expectations"
Bismarck to Las Vegas. The key to using Allegiant is to be realistic in your expectations. It is a budget airline that uses business tactics different than the major carriers to stay profitable. That means, older aircraft, younger crews, and gotcha games. If you can accept that and live with some minor first-world inconveniences, the cheap tickets are well worth it, especially for families like ours. Our flights were on time and comfortable. The crew wasn't overly friendly, but professional nonetheless. My only complaint is their iPhone App for boarding tickets. Though it is a good concept, the app caused my phone to freeze up right at the TSA checkpoint. Quite embarrassing. Overall we will use again without question.

### "canceled the flight"
Allegiant Air flight from Rochester to Sanford was fine and normal. However, the flight from Sanford to Rochester was horrible. Allegiant canceled the flight 45 minutes before take off because the flight crew hadn't arrived. Waited 2 hr's in line to see what they were going to do. Airport employees, not Allegiant employees, gave us a hotel voucher and an $8 voucher for airport food for 1 meal. No shuttle to the hotel, after we were told there would be. Had to split and pay $40 for a cab ride. Will never do business with them again.

### "an excellent flight"
Las Vegas to Minot. Was an excellent flight from start to finish. On time, actually slightly early, crew and staff we dealt with from baggage to flight crews were all very friendly. Flight went smoothly, had enough leg room and I'm 6'2". Bags weighed in at what I prechecked them at. As far as any extra charges for seating and luggage, etc. we knew what we were paying for as we actually read and selected what we wanted beforehand. We brought our own snacks and water bottles. Still way cheaper than any other airline option and was the only airline to offer a direct flight. Plane was older but in the end was all good!

### "save your money"
Flew Allegiant Air from Las Vegas to Billings, MT. I will never give them another cent of my money, I have flown them four times now and not once have I had a flight without issues. Flight was supposed to leave at 08.11, yet here I sit again due to their faulty aircraft. Save your money, I will spend a few bucks more and take a trusted airline next time.

### "pilot was not informative"
Flew from Des Moines, IA to Las Vegas, NV. Allegiant looks like they are an inexpensive airline but they really buckle and dime you every chance they get. Charges for luggage are outrageous and there is no complementary food or beverages. The stewardess were all very nice but the pilot was not informative while inflight (giving updates on where we were or how far away from our destination). We sat on the plane for an hour and 20 minutes before even taking off. Their customer service options are basically non-existent when it comes to lost items on the plane. We left a small clutch behind on our flight home and tried to notify them right away but no one at the counter seemed to care. On my next vacation I will take my business elsewhere.

### "good airline when they started"
Having flown Allegiant Air from the start of the Chattanooga/Sanford flight I must say the last two trips have been the most horrible I have had. My flight to Sanford was due to take off at 2:04. We took off at 8:20. We were not offered any explanation for the delay to begin with and then it was delay for mechanical. No problem it happens, but the gentleman was suppose to be there within 30 minutes, took 2 hours. Then he could not make the repair, so we were told they were bringing another plane from St. Pete. . We were told we would be getting a voucher for future flight. Never happened. They were a good airline when they started, but the last 3 flights have been nothing but bad.

### "customer service is the worst"
In my opinion everything that happened with our Allegiant trip could have been mitigated with good customer service but unfortunately Allegiant's customer service is the worst. The departure was delayed 2 hours (this happens with all airlines, we can deal with that). Upon arrival in FLL only 2 of our 3 bags arrived no Allegiant personnel (in baggage or ticket area) at the airport anywhere - none! There was a sign with a phone number on it at the ticket counter (30 minute call waits to get through, was disconnected twice). Bag was finally located in SAV and was shipped to our driving destination 3 days later. We were notified at 7:30 at night that our morning flight the next day was cancelled. After a 1.5 hour call wait time call we were told there were no flight options on their airline or any other one and that we would have to fly out the next morning. No hotel or meal vouchers were offered. I will never subject myself or my family to that kind of stress and inconvenience ever again!

### "Don't buy Trip Flex"
Punta Gorda, Florida to Asheville, N.C. I have never had any issues with Allegiant until I currently added Trip Flex for my daughters ticket. When I needed to change my flight because of my mother n laws memorial service was changed. I called and rescheduled the flight and added trip flex to that ticket as well. When I got my receipt for my ticket, I realized, they charged me for changing my flight. When I inquired, I got a copy of the policy which said that you could change 1 hour before departure. Had I known they meant you couldn't change it until one hour before your flight, I wouldn't have purchased the Trip Flex. Obviously that is not a deal. They are making money off of people, not helping the customer which you would think they are providing protection in case of emergency. Don't buy Trip Flex. It is a rip off.

### "keep our staff at a minimum"
We got to Grand Rapids plenty early, Allegiant had 2 flights leaving. They only had 2 people at check in and the line stretched the length of the airport. We finally get to our plane and we can't board, we have to wait for Allegiant flight to Mesa to leave. But most of their passengers are still in check in. I emailed Allegiant and they said, to keep our prices low, we keep our staff at a minimum. We left over an hour late, they charge for everything, only 40 pounds per bag at 50 bucks, what a great deal.

### "won't fly again with them"
St. Petersburg to Springfield with Allegiant. We were on the St. Petersburg end of the flight reviewed by P Sooter below. Same story. Delayed 1 hour, then 3.5 hrs. No pilot was their excuse. Staff at the counter had no clue what was happening. We were delayed an hour in Springfield on the first leg of our journey. Spending 6 hrs in an airport isn't fun. Won't fly again with them.

### "commend the ground crew"
Syracuse to Clearwater/St. Petersburg. I flew priority boarding with two granddaughters. I would like to commend the ground crew in Syracuse for their caring hospitality. The ladies at check in were more than accommodating and could not have been more polite. The gentleman who transported me in the wheelchair also was polite and friendly. This made for such a relaxing way to start our flight. The girls were allowed to go along with me through the whole boarding procedure. Thank you grounds crew in Syracuse from Allegiant Airlines and the crew of flight 843.

### "shame on you Allegiant"
Springfield to St. Pete-Clearwater, told flight would be 1 hr late, then 3 hrs, then 3.5hrs. Boarded at 7:30pm for 7:45 depart, at 8:10 the pilot sorry for 3+hr delay not sure reason. At 8:25pm waiting for paperwork - pilot and crew milling around cockpit area laughing and joking, very unprofessional. At 8:40 pm now a maintenance problem, tech will be there 15 to 30 mins time, and the pilot hopes it will be "quick fix". At 8:55 we've had enough and leave the aircraft to head back home. Agent says will get full refund - we'll see. Never got off the ground. Shame on you Allegiant - never again!

### "seats are terrible"
Terrible experience flying with Allegiant Air from start to finish. You may think you're getting a deal but after the fees and taxes it is about the same. Nothing is included in the cost of the flight either. The seats are terrible and the staff was not professional. Flying out of Clearwater was a total cluster and the flight was delayed because they were short staffed. After we boarded the plane we waited for another 30 minutes because the captain had to do "paperwork. I will go back to flying Delta.

### "person in wheelchair has no such luck"
Las Vegas to Springfield, and whilst Allegiant Air may have a policy of keeping a family with children intact, a person in a wheelchair has no such luck. When we printed out our boarding passes I was in one row and my traveling companion was in another row - not even close. On one occasion I was in row 8 and my companion was in row 34 - when I called the airline I was told they would put us close for a fee. Another time when I called, the person I talked to was very nice and got us together without a fee. I have been on this trip on a number of times and that was the only time they did that without a fee. My wife and I are on social security and have limited funds so the $20 is not in our budget. It would be nice if they had some compassion instead of being money hungry.

### "inexcusable customer service"
Fort Lauderdale to Asheville. This was my first time flying Allegiant Air and also my last. This was inexcusable customer service. We were delayed close to an hour, but that was the least problem we encountered. We got within 10 miles of AVL and were told we needed to circle because the cloud cover was too heavy to land. After 45 minutes we were told we were flying back to FLL. In the ensuing 1 hr 45 minute flight back, no other announcement was made, the flight attendants claimed they had no info, and were rude and all but disappeared. Call buttons were going off all over the plane and were being ignored. We departed the plane with no information about rebooking, no representative at the gate, and no information. A baggage handler close by was caught by surprise and tried to find out something, which he finally told those who could hear him that the flight was rebooked for the next morning, there would be no room or food vouchers and everyone was on their own. He was asked to make an announcement so the 150 passengers could all hear, but he would not do that and left everyone confused. I understand things beyond an airline's control but customer service is always within an airline's control, Allegiant failed on all counts. Spend the extra $$ upfront with a reliable carrier.

### "notified of delay then canceled"
Orlando to Austin with Allegiant Air. Horrible service. Notified shortly before flight of delay then canceled. No reciprocal airline and Orlando is a huge airport. Offered us 50USD off the next flight - like I will take that chance. Said we will be flying out on the next day that they don't even fly out on. Still waiting to see if that happens as they canceled today. Funny when we called the girl didn't even have the flight as canceled had it as rescheduled although my email showed it canceled. After 45 minutes of discussion gave up to search other flights all 1000 bucks or so. Called back about another flight to Texas same day to another city which would require us to drive further but told so sad all booked. This was after an hour on hold . Guess what? Got the same girl - maybe they can only afford one customer service rep. We have extra hotel charges rental car charges meal charges and now it is 3.15am so lost a few hours sleep as well. Sure we will feel perky tomorrow to find something to do for a whole day unplanned extra entertainment costs etc theme parks here are 100 bucks a day or more a piece. The discount rate is not worth the inconvenience lack of reciprocity aggravation etc - still don't know if we will get out tomorrow and if not - not willing to plunk down 2 grand to another airline. Sad I haven't had a vacation in 3 and half years and it starts like this.

### "if $50 is worth poor customer service"
I was very aware when I booked Allegiant for our spring break trip that they are a discount airline. Attaching fees wherever possible and absolutely no perks. Tonight made be rethink ever using this airline again. Our flight was delayed 6 hours. Our attendant at the gate even made a joke about it being the ghost plane. We finally took off at 11:45 pm and as we descended into Sandford the pilot annunced that we are heading to St Petersberg because the landing tower was closed and the weather didn't allow him to make a visual landing. 2:15 am we land in St Petersburg and are told busses would come within 30 minutes to bring us to Sandford (2 hours away). 3:40 am busses arrive. There are not enough bus seats for all the passengers. There is not one customer service employee from Allegiant helping.. Just some very kind cleaning staff. Allegiant knew the tower was closed in Sanford before we left Grand Rapids. Car rentals also closed and not opening until 7am. It is 4 am and we will wait again upon arriving in Sanford. You decide if $50 a ticket is worth poor customer service.

### "only recall one flight on-time"
Flown with this airline approximately 30 times, and out of those I can only recall one flight being on-time. They suck you in with convenient non-stop routes and low fares, but it comes at a cost. This will be my last flight with Allegiant. The majors are easily worth 2-3x the ticket cost because they actually get you where you are going in a reasonable amount of time. My initial flight was scheduled out of KPGD around 3pm. I was informed via text at 9:30am it had been delayed over 4 hours. After 2.5 hours on the phone with customer service, I was told the flight from St Pete-Clearwater to Asheville was on-time and moved to that flight. Arrived at the airport and the flight had been delayed over 2 hours with no explanation to passengers. Bottom line: get what you pay for. Namely, showing up when you paid to show up.

### "worst airline I have ever used"
St Petersburg Clearwater to Cincinnati with Allegiant Air. This is the worst airline I have ever used. At first our flight was delayed (no big deal). Then when we got on the plane we waited for a good hour for some mysterious reason. We were told like 10 more minutes at least 4 times. When we finally got here the baggage took at least a hour and it did not even come on the belt it said it would. Finally we were on vacation! Then when it was time to go back we strolled in expecting not such a bad time. When we saw the board it said it was 'on time. When we got to the waiting area we found out we were delayed for 1 hour 40 minutes. While I am waiting I am writing this review.

### "delays and absent service"
We tried Allegiant Air because it offers the only non-stop service between PIT and JAX. And that is the full extent of what this airline has to offer. At best, Allegiant Air's service is comical, but functional - at worst, it's non-existent. Customer service is like a pick-up team of airline personnel from ticketing to flight crew. Check-in lines are long because the counter is only open for one hour prior to flight, so everyone is forced to queue at once. Both flights were delayed (one hour and two hours, respectively) for no apparent reason. In the aircraft cabin, the seats are set close together yet the aisle is very wide. The high bag check fees ensure that boarding will be very slow. Promotion doesn't seem to be part of the corporate marketing strategy. There are practically no signs anywhere - at ticket/check-in counter or gates. Pricing is not especially competitive on this route once the add-ons for bag checks and better seats are included. The non-stop flight is convenient, but given the delays and absent service, we would not fly Allegiant again.

### "never again will I fly Allegiant"
Mcallen to Las Vegas, and very, very disappointed with Alligent Air. They boarded the plane, then asked people to unboard. Waited 3 hours before told that our flight was canceled. My daughter looked forward to this trip for months as we were headed to a Justin bieber concert. After 3 long hours of waiting, we saw the pilot and his crew deboard escorted by security and we knew the worse news was about to hit us. Sure enough, our flight was canceled and the announcement was very unapologetic and they did not know when next flight would be scheduled. Said we could get vouchers and that was it. I saw so many children disappointed, including my daughter, and there was nothing we could do to console her. Such a terrible, stressful experience for us and all involved. We were left with stunned. Never again will I fly Allegiant Air. First and last time.

### "can experience very long delays"
Bellingham WA to Los Angeles CA with Allegiant Air. Our family has been flying down to LA for about a month each week for medical treatments. Allegiant has been on time and the check in / boarding pass system works well. If you are travelling with kids the online check in will not allow you to check in if you did not pre select your seats for a fee. I have had negative experiences with this airline in the past but it is exceeding expectations largely in part to the new aircraft on this route. Be warned that you can experience very long delays with this airline with no compensation.

### "seats taken away from us"
Medford to Las Vegas. Paid for our extra legroom seats because my husband is 6'5, and we got our seats taken away from us. Not very happy - we got our money back but it took a while, plus his trip was uncomfortable the whole way. Also we paid for our tickets and got recharged again. I've called and email them and still haven't received a call back

### "not being fully reimbursed"
Because of flight cancellation we got a note each from Allegiant staff at the airport that we were eligible to use 250 dollars each on hotel and transportation. After our trip we should simply send our receipts to Allegiant for reimbursement. Now (5 months after) we are still not being fully reimbursed. They say it's 250 dollars total - not per person. I was not pleased with this and emailed the note we got from the Allegiant staff at the airport where it says 250 each. After that we're told not to contact Allegiant again. Further correspondance would not be answered. Way to go Allegiant!

### "choose a different airline"
Allegiant Air delayed our flight from Medford to Las Vegas for two hours then cancelled it entirely and had no respect or sympathy for the money we were out for hotel and other costs. They did not offer any assistance and we had to go through a different airline costing us twice as much just to get where we needed to go. If quality and customer survice matters at all to you, choose a different airline - this is not the first time we have had this problem with them, but it will surely be our last!

### "be using this airline again"
Indianapolis to Sanford, and I loved it - it was a straight flight (2 hours) and you can't beat the price. If you can give up your snack for a cheaper ticket, then I will do that. We checked in on our phones and it was super easy. I hope they can keep their prices down - we will definitely be using this airline again. Thank you Allegiant Air.

### "never fly Allegiant Air again"
Rockford, Illinois to St. Petersburg, Florida. We will never fly Allegiant Air again. Our flight was delayed several times. We keep hearing only 40 more minutes, or 20 more minutes. We finally got on the plane and got stuck there just after leaving the gate. Once we finally landed, there was no direction as to which area luggage could get picked up at. Several planes coming in with only one crew to unload. We waited for our luggage for over an hour.

### "ruining our vacation"
Little Rock AR to Sanford FL. We booked a flight and hotel originally through Allegiant only to receive a text informing me that the confirmation number I had received would not be honored. Against my better judgement, I kept the flight with Allegiant. I would soon regret that decision. First we had an extremely delayed flight 729, then a cancelled flight 729. Then an extremely inept and rude support staff that communicated sporadically if at all. To add to that, we had damage to all three of our bags, one of which is now completely unusable. Then it took 2 hours to get a hotel voucher. We were promised a meal voucher for $8.00 per person but they didn't manage to get those to us before the newly rescheduled flight 5729 departed at 7 am Central the next morning. We had to cancel our hotel reservation which wasn't fully refundable because we didn't provide a 24 hour notice (620.00 for 2 nights only one refundable). Moreover, the hotel we booked after cancelling the original was 45 minutes away from our destination meaning we also had to rent a car (105.00). We paid 11.90 for parking for the first flight that didn't depart on Friday as planned. Thank you very much for ruining our vacation.

### "sat at the gate"
My outbound flight was decent, seating ok but I'm a 5'9" female and no leg room. My return flight from Akron–Canton to St Petersburg Clearwater Airport boarded late and we were rushed to board via dual entry (front and end of plane). We sat at the gate and pulled onto the tarmac, only to sit there for 45 minutes before we were told what's going on. Some of the staff were very rude. Attendants were not informing us what was going on. We pulled back into the gate. No air, 2+ hours of sitting on the plane before we were offered 1/4 cup of water. People leaving the plane. Not very good on informing us with status. Watched a plane next to us that unloaded people and luggage, reload luggage and people and take off. Sat for 3+ hours on the plane. Not greeted on outbound or return flights. Will never fly Allegiant again. No free snacks or anything.

### "became so cold and uncomfortable"
I have flown Allegiant air multiple times with my family when travelling to Florida. Many Canadians who live near the border have no problem making the commute to save hundreds on flights with Allegiant (myself included). Last time I flew with Allegiant I was 4 months pregnant, the air temperature system in the cabin was not working. The airline was aware of this and did not notify the passengers ahead of time. Therefore, we had to fly in a cabin that had a temperature of around 55 degrees in the back of the plane and 80 in the front for 4 hours. Since we were flying in the middle of summer, I can assure you that people were not prepared for the cold. I ended up moving seats up to the front because I became so cold and uncomfortable. An elderly woman tried to move into an unoccupied seat at the front of the aircraft and was told that she would have to pay extra for that seat. We assumed that the plane would be grounded due to the malfunction but they barely unloaded us before the loaded the next passengers on the return flight without fixing the problem.

### "Great, friendly service"
Taking the time to read the information on Allegiant Air's website would alleviate a lot of bad reviews. Allegiant is a budget airline. Absolutely everything beyond a seat on the plane costs extra. I booked a very cheap flight and knew what I was getting so I was pleased. The Allegiant personnel in OKC were wonderful and helpful. I was putting my teenager on a plane alone for the first time and they offered, without me asking, to give me a gate pass to walk her through security and to the gate. Great, friendly service. To avoid extra, surprise charges, read all the info on their website. Book all luggage when you book the flight or incur greater charges at the airport. Even carry on luggage costs. Only a purse or laptop is free. Print your own boarding pass. Bring your own snack.

### "on time and smooth"
We have flown with Allegiant Air on 4 occasions round-trip from Bangor to St.Pete/Clearwater. We have never encountered any issues. Flights have been on time and smooth. The price is right but remember that this is an economy airline so expect that you will have to pay extra for baggage (entitled to one free personal bag), seat selection (free otherwise), and any and all snacks (bring your own). There is no inflight entertainment so bring your own tablet or laptop with movies, music downloaded.

### "experience was unpleasant "
The process of booking a ticket and having to add all the little extra fees is a nightmare. You think you are getting a good deal but after adding in a fee for everything other than the air to breathe in flight it is not a savings as they would have you think. The representatives in the airport are a non professional, non friendly group of individuals. We encountered this on both ends of our trip but particularly worse in South Bend Indiana. My sister and I were traveling with my elderly parents and were seated two rows apart and they would not allow us to board together because we were seated in different "zones". They really had no desire to understand my parents requiring our assistance. Unloading of the plane is a monkey circus free for all of people rushing the door and dropping bags on your head rather than Allegiant considering the departure to be by rows to avoid this chaos. Attendants have no problem placing your carry on's rows behind your actual seat only making departure that much more difficult. Overall experience was unpleasant and I will definitely consider another airline in the future even if I have to pay a few more dollars. Savings not worth the lack of professionalism.

### "on phone for nearly 3 hours "
We reserved 4 seats to Las Vegas. Could not fly out on that date for reasons that could not be changed. I did not purchase trip flex. A hard learned expensive lesson. However; I have been trying to rectify this. I had waited on the phone for nearly 3 hours in 4 calls over 2 days before I spoke to customer service. She gave me instructions to call back with a specific date and although there would be costs they would work with me. After more than an hour waiting, again, I got another representative. I told her what I had been told. She was curt. Matter of fact. To change $408 reservation was going to cost an additional $75 per person. Plus $300 for a change fee. And possibly additional charges. I chose Allegiant because they were supposed to be affordable. I told her I would just cancel. I didn't want the $56 they would return to me. I was never going to do business with them again. I didn't yell. I didn't curse. I was not happy. But I wasn't rude. She hung up on me. After 4 hours waiting on the phone. Tonight I went to the website to cancel. Says I can't. That I must cancel via phone. Worst company I have dealt with.

### "no confidence in this airline"
We flew Allegiant Air Wednesday night to Ft. Lauderdale from Syracuse. We were told by friends that the reputation for Allegiant was that they were always late. We experienced this in the extreme. The original flight time was 6:45PM. We received a text that it was moved back to 7:55PM. We finally boarded at 8:30PM and took off at 11:30PM. After leaving the terminal we needed to de-ice but after de-icing the pilot announced that we didn't have enough fuel to make it to FLL so we had to return to the terminal. After re-fueling we then needed to de-ice. How could the pilot not know that the fuel was not sufficient before we left the terminal the first time? We finally arrived in Ft. Lauderdale at 2:30AM. The attendants were very cavalier and seemed to have the attitude that this happens all the time. I'm sorry but I have no confidence in this airline and will avoid using them in the future.

### "looked unkempt and worn out"
Have flown Allegiant many times with absolutely no problems. My recent flight was a nightmare. We were boarded and re-boarded 3 different times over a 4 hour period, because of mechanical problems. This is not a warm and fuzzy feeling to be boarded on the 3rd plane. I reported the issue and was informed that because our delay was not long enough they could not compensate me for any convenience. I am 70 years old and it is not a pleasure to get on and get off a airplane. Was very disappointed in Allegiant for allowing their fleet of planes to become so unstable with mechanical problems. And I must agree with other reviews; the flight attendants looked unkempt and worn out, just like their planes.

### "no competition, always late"
Medford to Las Vegas with Allegiant - I have flown this airline several times because it is the only game in town. No competition and always late. Have been dropped off in the middle of the night at a different airport due to fog and offered no assistance to get home about 150 miles away. Flew this week and 2 and 3 hour delays (mechanical) Terrible customer service, no one answers phone. Rude and indifferent people working at the counter in Medford. Everything is an up charge. I'll drive next time.

### "not another cent from me"
Orlando to Cincinnati with Allegiant - 1 hour wait on the customer service line to get no answer to my question. If you want an airline that cares about their customers, go to anyone else. Bumped our flight up 10 hours, so there's no way we could make it back to the flight from our cruise. Had to stay an extra day, with all the extra expenses involved, and only received a form letter from management stating I should have read the flight agreement before purchasing my ticket. This airline will not get another cent from me.

### "never fly Allegiant again"
My fiance and I will never fly Allegiant again. The flight departure was pushed back three times due to mechanical issues with the aircraft. We boarded the aircraft three hours after our original departure time. Once we were seated on the aircraft were were delayed another two hours as we waited for the crew to summon a deicing truck. During the two hours on the ground, the aircraft's air conditioning system was shut down. The crew would not provide water or allow anyone to use the bathroom. We arrived at our destination at 2:30 am. Five hours and thirty minutes after the originally scheduled arrival. Instead of being picked up by family, we were forced to take a cab to the nearest hotel. We stayed there until a family member could come pick us up.

### "not worth all the hassle anymore"
We have flown with Allegiant Air many times over the past several years and I believe this last experience will be our last. While it's nice to have a non-stop flight to one of our favorite traveling destinations (Orlando/Disney World), I believe it's no longer worth it. With the cost of flights increasing plus they price gouge you for everything including check in luggage (which is only 40 pounds max), carry on luggage, picking your seat per person per flight, in-flight snacks/beverages, and now recently they've added on a charge to print off your boarding ticket at the counter. This last flight I truly witnessed how they love to price gouge their customers. My husband and I did not want to pay the fees to have to sit together - I think it's ridiculous that an airline should charge for this - it should be a courtesy. However, the airline will deliberately separate you and when you do an online check-in the night before, they will show you that you are separate, that you can't change it at the counter and that you have to pay $$ if you don't want to sit next to a stranger. I was 31 weeks pregnant and we were placed at two opposite ends of the plane, me row 14 and my husband row 29. Two rows in front of my husband were two empty seats where we could have been placed together. Also, next to me was a young single girl who could have been moved elsewhere very easily, and also about 5 rows behind me were two additional empty seats. Of course the staff tells everyone not to switch seats. Just goes to show how Allegiant Air doesn't really care about taking care of their customers, they just want your money. It's sickening to me and instead of paying that fee so I can sit next to my husband, we're choosing other airlines from now on. Plus I maybe ran into one friendly person the entire round trip flight. It's just not worth all the hassle anymore.

### "efficient and friendly"
Excellent flight from Charleston to St. Pete-Clearwater with Allegiant Air. Low cost. Fee for checked and carry on bags. Left on time. Nice seats on jet. Air crew were efficient and friendly. Quick direct flight to sunshine and then home. In airport staff both locations seemed friendly and efficient too. Enjoyed my trip which I rarely say about flying.

### "staff did absolutely nothing"
I have one positive thing to say about our Allegiant Air flight from Punta Gorda to Allentown so I will say it first. Lots of leg room. Instead of nickel and diming you to death, they should get rid of half their flight attendants. They were so unkept I could hardly believe it. Sloppy uniforms and dirty messy hair. The two up front by us were extremely immature. The one reading on the PA system read so fast she screwed up time and time again. Other than try and sell snacks, they did absolutely nothing. Our two "young ladies" talked loudly amongst themselves constantly. One of them stood up front eating breakfast on a 2 hour flight. An elderly gentleman needed to use the rest room during turbulence and wasn't allowed to help make sure he didn't fall. OK, so it is their rule, but the exchange was less than friendly and his fellow passenger ended up helping him. Our fares could be more reasonable if they just got rid of half of their under qualified useless attendants. The pilots weren't informative either and when they did interact with us you couldn't understand them anyway.

### "amazing bang for the buck"
Amazing bang for the buck. My girlfriend and I flew round trip for $320, combined! Yes, the seats do not recline. Yes, you have to pay for assigned seats. Yes, you have to pay for snacks. But, if you are a low maintenance traveler like we are, this is the airline for you.

### "rude and unsympathetic"
Los Angeles to Boise with Allegiant Air. Flight was supposed to leave at 5:30pm. Delayed for "mechanical issues" for 40 mins and then again for another plane to fly in from Vegas. Plane was supposed to leave Las Vegas at 7 and be here at 8. For some reason it has been pushed back to 9:45 departure time now with no further explanation. Staff is nowhere in sight to talk to. When they finally showed up they offer no help and are rude and unsympathetic at all for the now 4.5 hour delay. Terrible experience and some of the worst customer service I have seen. The only compensation they offered was a meal voucher that they didn't hand out till 3 hours after we were already supposed to have departed. What good is a meal voucher at 8 when I have obviously already eaten?

### "mechanical problems"
Allegiant Air flight from Punta Gorda to Toledo. Departure delayed initially because of weather in Toledo when there really was no weather problem. Departure 6 hours late due to mechanical problems, had to fly in another plane. Return flught cancelled as boarding began, delayed departure until next day - 18 hrs later. Again mechanical issues cited.

### "book Allegiant again"
Allegiant offers flights at a great value. My flight both to and from my destination were on time. Both flights were smooth, and I felt like I was in very capable hands with the pilots. The flight attendants on both flights were friendly and helpful. I would book Allegiant again.

### "organized and efficient"
First time flying with Allegiant Air from Los Angeles to Honolulu and it was much better than we expected based on the negative reviews. Both flights were on time, boarding was organized and efficient, and the flight itself was very smooth. All employees were personable and friendly. They were helpful to passengers who needed any assistance finding their seat, putting luggage away, etc. We had no challenges with our carry on luggage so no additional charges. We found the snack and drink prices reasonable, $4-5 for snacks and $2 for water and soft drinks. Most people did take their own food and drinks on board and the crew picked up all trash in a timely fashion. We will fly Allegiant again in a few months. We paid about $628 for two RT Los Angeles to Honolulu flights and look forward to saving money again. No WiFi so we took books. No reclining seat so take a neck pillow. These are small inconveniences for the money saved.

### "super helpful, accommodating"
Niagara Falls to Orlando Sanford, and this is our third time flying Allegiant. Never had any issues and this flight was the best so far. We flew with three kids under 3 and the stewardesses were beyond amazing. Super helpful, accommodating and went out of their way to make our flight as easy as possible. Would recommend.

### "don't think I'll risk again"
Omaha to St Pete–Clearwater. Our 10:54 am departure did not happen due to mechanical problems with the plane. At 5:30pm our replacement aircraft arrived. As of 6:20pm we're finally loaded and waiting to go. To Allegiant Air's credit they didi offer complimentary water and soda at the podium along with an $8 meal voucher in the airport. If time is of the essence on your trip, I suggest paying whatever another scheduled carrier is asking to stand a better chance of arriving on time. I don't think I'll risk flying Allegiant again just to make sure I get where I'm going on time or get offered a refund.

### "found it extremely irritating"
Flew Allegiant Air from Las Vegas to Memphis. It does not bother me that Allegiant Air charges extra for reserved seats, carry ons, food, etc. I expect flights to be crowded and my fellow travelers to obnoxious, although I must admit that I was mildly surprised that I had adequate space even while sitting in the middle seat. However, I do not expect the flight attendants to be unprofessional but that is exactly what they were. While the plane was loading, they conversed with each other about their social lives and made negative comments about the passengers. They were non-existent during the actual flight. The second we landed, they accessed their social media accounts and began an extremely loud running commentary about who had posted to their accounts. They acted more like middle school students than professionals and I found it extremely irritating.

### "on time and best pricing"
Bellingham to Vegas, and I have flown with Allegiant Air several times over the years and not once had an issue with service or flights. Flight crew are friendly and flights have been on time and best pricing. You get free beverages and snacks, with the option to purchase meals which are quite nice. Try Allegiant Air for great service!

### "not once have they actually been on time"
Allegiant Air flight from was late leaving from Des Moines and on our return very late in take off from Punta Gorda. They are supposed to be an economical airline, but all the fees, checked, carry on bags, seat cost, and all the extras, like paying for snacks or soft drinks, is outrageous. Our family and relatives have all flown on this airline, and not once have they actually been on time. Even with the idea of a straight through flight, none of the relatives will fly this way again.

### "the flight from hell"
Allentown to Orlando Sanford on Allegiant Air. Flew down on the Thursday before the major snow storm. Beside the fact that every single thing was extra (carry on bags, seat, beverage,) We had the flight from hell. My daughter and I were planning on napping, but because of the drunk couple behind us that the flight attendant kept feeding them more alcohol even though they had to know they had enough, they were so loud that everyone one the plane could hear them and the couple across from them which caused the lady sitting next to them had to ask to move. Not once during the 2.5 hour flight did they stop talking and laughing and swearing and yet no one from Allegiant told them to be quiet. I have never been on a flight that was as terrible as this one. Never again will I fly this airline even if they are cheaper.

### "ruined a weekend trip"
Cincinnati to Las Vegas, and Allegiant Air ruined a weekend trip that was planned prior to Christmas! First, airline delayed the departure time with a later time in afternoon. Advised it was due to issue with plane and not the weather. The second departure time comes and goes. Then after sitting at airport passed that time another plane was found. All passengers were boarded and ready for take off. Plane sat on the tarmac for a long time. No potty breaks etc. Now this plane had issues with maintenance and had to go back to the gate. Flight crew announces the flight was cancelled until the next day in the afternoon. Two of the family members had JLO concert tickets! Hope this airline is happy that they totally ruin 4 people mini vacation. Shame on you Allegiant! Get your act together and service your planes. We could understand it if it was due to the weather. However, that was not the case!

### "check bill carefully"
We flew Allegiant Air out of Fort Wayne to Punta Gorda and the flight was little late because of weather, so not a big deal. On the flight back a little delayed because plane before us was waiting for six lost people again not big deal. However when we get home I found a 100$ charge from them - so three phone calls later (45min) each wait (had to hang up twice). I was told I was charged because of my personal items. Well how do you charge someone and not tell them?! That is what their people told me and I could only get a voucher with an extention (which I pushed for because we are not sure when we can go again). Then I get an invoice last night that says the reason I was charged is due to my checked bag being overweight. I know for a fact it was 36 lbs because I joked to my husband that we could have bought some more stuff. So the questions that begs to be answered - how can I be told two different things and the agent checking us in never said that we would be charged. In my opinion that's just wrong. So check your bill carefully!

### "each flight late"
This is the third flight I have taken with Allegiant Air between Raleigh-Durham and Orlando Sanford. Each flight this airline has managed to be 1.5-2.5 hours late. The reason for the last flights delay: "we started off late this morning so we have been behind all day". Needless to say, a good price; however, not much guarantee on arrival times. The staff is nice enough and snacks and beverages are not provided. You pay for a carry on bag or check in bags. Their delay notification was not provided in a timely manner. Weigh your options of price versus time. Assume you will not arrive on time so you are delighted if you do.

### "never recommend them"
Was supposed to fly Allegiant Air on the 15th from Memphis to Orlando, flight was cancelled due to too many flight hours. It was a two hour delay we stood around until they cancelled. They put us in a hotel where you had to buy your own food. We had to get up at 4:30 in the morning to be shuttled to airport. And stand in line because they didn't open until 5am. They were rude and inconsiderate! I would never recommend them to anyone. Pay extra for a better airline.

### "Allegiant is horrible"
Flying with Allegiant Air is horrible. This is our second time flying with them. The first time we had a plane tire pop which caused a 9 hour delay. This time they cancelled our flight from Los Angeles to Provo until tomorrow. We were supposed to leave at 1:50 today and it's not leaving until tomorrow at noon. Their claim is that it's weather related (a flat out lie) so they are providing zero compensation for the inconvenience. We've been on hold with their 'customer service' for over half an hour, and we're already a been hung up on once. Do not risk flying with this airline. It's worth the money to fly with a decent airline that will actually take care of their customers.

### "not worth the inconvenience"
Phoenix–Mesa to Idaho, and it never fails that Allegiant Air disappoints its customers. Yes, it is a cheap way to fly, but not worth the inconvenience of being delayed by three or more hours due to their planes needing maintenance continuously. The last three times I have flown their flights have been unreasonably delayed. two out of those three times the return flight has been delayed by a day. On top of that, any time a customer calls customer service there is always a 30-40 minute wait to get a real person on the phone only to have them argue with you about a reimbursement or to hang up on you. this airline is cheap and bad at doing business. They are not dependable nor customer focused.

### "affordable to fly"
First time I flew Allegiant Air, it was recommended by a friend. I was impressed with the amount I paid, everyone was very nice. I have never flown alone so i was nervous but the stewardess told me if I was still nervous to let her know and they would do everything possible to keep me at ease. The plane was clean. My flight arrived early and was a great ride. I will continue to fly this airline they make it affordable to come home to see family more often. give them a try. I didn't need to check a bag so there was no added cost for that. Thank you for making it affordable to fly.

### "clean timely and professional"
Used Allegiant Air to fly from Appleton to Phoenix on December 22nd and returned today January 3rd. Very clean timely and professional staff. Saved a lot on airfare over Southwest and got comparable service - happy all the way around. We don't need all the extra add on so it's very economical. For people that don't understand the charges, study the website closer before you book your trip - it's pretty easy people, figure it out.

### "get what you pay for"
For the most part, my experience with Allegiant has, thankfully, not been like many of the experiences other reviewers have encountered. For the most part, Allegiant, at least, when I flew them, got me there on time. However, the ground staff is pretty much unfriendly as ever. On a flight from LAS-HNL, the flight attendants have been the best part of the flight, smiling and courteous, so no gripes there, though of course sometimes they're a bit of a mixed bag, and on one flight from EUG-LAS, I had one flight attendant that was a bit rude. However, on my recent flight from HNL-LAS, there was an unexpected delay with little to no apologies. Got to the gate 30 minutes before boarding time and when boarding time was supposed to happen, the Flight Attendants were still sitting at a locked door, chatting away. The Flight crew showed up 15 minutes later, and even then it took 30 minutes until they could enter. Even then, there were still more unexpected delays due to seatbelt and reseating issues. Which they didn't even bother to announce. I only knew about it because I overheard Flight attendants talking about it. For the most part, Allegiant, in my experience at least, isn't the absolute worst airline. You do get what you pay for. However, with outrageous fees, limits on bags, really tight and uncomfortable seating, and just horrible service, I'm going to have to say Allegiant isn't really an airline you should consider flying.

### "not recommend Allegiant"
Bangor to Orlando. Worst experience I've ever had flying. My flight to Orlando was delayed by 6 hours because the plane was broken and we needed to be sent a new plane. The Allegiant staff at the Bangor airport were rude and not helpful. I asked to have my return fight changed to compensate for losing almost a full day with my parents, and they said no and offered no apologies or explanations. However, after calling the customer service number, they had no problem changing my return flight and happily did so. My return flight had an emergency landing in Rhode Island, and the pilot announced that the engine was overheating. We landed safely in RI and were greeted with about 6 firetrucks as soon as we landed. We waited hours before having an updates from Allegiant as to what was going to happen to us. At first they said they'd bus us to Bangor, but ended up putting us all in hotel rooms for the night and we flew out the next morning at 11am. Only one Allegiant flight attendant on the morning flight apologized for our inconvenience. The Warwick airport workers (not Allegiant staff) were excellent and accommodated us as well as they could, given the circumstances. I would not recommend Allegiant to anyone, despite the cheap prices. Not to mentions all the hidden fees.

### "add on and hidden fees"
Los Angeles to Eugene. When booking my flight I was excited about the opportunity to fly home for the holidays at an affordable price. For a college student this pricing was exceptional but the price is only possible for Allegiant Air because they have many add on and hidden fees. When checking in at the front desk it was 30$ extra to have my small backpack taken on as a carry-on, 5$ to have your ticket printed, and something like 7$ for any on plane amenity. The staff was not very helpful and the flight attendants rudely snapped at guest to get their attention. The seats were old and the crew seemed to be more inclined to gossip as opposed to serve the customer. Spending a bit extra for a more established airline is well worth it.

### "bad service, delays"
Horrible customer service. Omaha to Tampa flight cancelled due to "weather" yesterday when we watched several other flights taking off and landing. They kept telling us at the gate that it was due to refueling, deicing fluid trucks, crew time out, and so forth. When customers started asking for vouchers then it was due to weather and not what we had been told. Don't bother calling their call center because they will just tell you to submit your complaint online and they won't help you at all! Flight rescheduled for this morning and we are already an hour late. By the time we get in the air we will be almost two hours delayed! You get what you pay for with this low cost airline. Bad service, delays and no accountability!

### "likely the rudest staff"
Allegiant Air's business model is interesting, take the outlying markets and offer direct flights to tourist destinations. This sounds good helping these areas and providing a service right? The problem are added fees that quickly take those savings away and reliability issues that may leave you a day or more late. If you look for a direct flight from an outlying market its appealing, flying in non-reclining seats so tight you can't open a book, delayed or rescheduled at their convenience due to aging aircraft, it may be worth the chance. When you get on board the fun continues with what are most likely the rudest staff I've ever encountered, budget constraints dictate staff caliber also apparently. The decision is yours ultimately, it may be worth rolling the dice, just build in an extra day on each end for delays and you will likely be fine.

### "stuffed in like sardines"
In addition to the airline nickle and diming you, the flights are 2-3 hours late leaving for mechanical problems. This is not a discount airline after you add on additional fees. In addition to your base ticket price, get ready for $5 for ticketing, $50 for carry-on, $50 for checked bag, $15+ for a seat selection. By the time you get on board you have spent the same as a normal airline and are not guaranteed the flight will ever leave on time. You are also stuffed in like sardines. No leg room.

### "high risk of being late"
We have flown several times on Allegiant Air and last night makes the second time that we have been late, and they don't offer much of an answer to anything. This company is very hard to communicate with. We had a flight sometime back from Florida to NC with no weather issues and the plane was very late and no explanation was really offered. Yesterday afternoon we should have been on a 2:49 pm flight and they said the flight was diverted and would be late. The times for arrival kept changing. The plane finally got us to Greenville SC late in the evening. No apology except by the captain in flight. If you don't like the high risk of being late then go for the no frills ride. I think we will pay the extra money and get less boundaries on luggage, seating etc with a major airline.

### "lack of service & courtesy"
Allegiant Air ruined my Christmas and have the worst customer service - it's like dealing with robots! Getting a good deal is not worth the lack of service and common courtesy. They cancelled our flight by sending a text when we were already at the airport to check in and didn't have any staff ready to handle all the upset passengers.

### "not left due to weather"
Plane was supposed to depart at 9:23am. It's now 12:59 and I am still on the airplane at the gate. Have not left due to weather. The weather has been clear for an hour. We have been stuck in our seats for 70 minutes. When I tried to get up to use the restroom I was told I could not until we were in the air. That was 30 minutes ago. The flight attendant staff is by far the worst.

### "not fly this airline again"
Most horrible experience flying I have ever had. I have flown all over the world and I have never been angry about delays, flight cancellations because they happen and I'm a reasonable person who can deal if a curve ball is thrown. Allegiant air has no rhyme or reason for anything. They don't give you a straight answer. It took me 11 hours to get to Arizona from Ogden Utah. They first told us it was on behalf of the 3 inches of snow outside. This was untrue because had the plane been on time we would have missed the snow entirely. Then they stated that a plane was coming for us but was diverted to St. George to refuel. There is no allegiant hub in St. George. Then they told us that the plane from St. George was on it's way back but that is not the plane we will be taking anymore. Then they told us the plane we are taking had mechanical difficulties so we will continue to be delayed. The most frustrating part of this whole ordeal was that we couldn't get a straight answer from anyone. Allegiant refused to refund out flight as well as refused to offer any kind of voucher for our extreme inconvenience. They wouldn't let me talk to any supervisors on the customer service line and refused to give me any names of the customer service agents. This is not the first time I have flown with Allegiant and it is not the first time I have been given the run around story of why they can't keep a schedule. I will not fly this airline again. If you value you your job and need to be back at work when you say you will instead of stranded in another state do not fly with Allegiant. Cheaper fares? After they nickle and dime  you for everything from bringing your own purse, to charging you for a half a can of soda, you end up saving maybe 100 bucks. Not worth the 11 hours waiting and missing out on family time over thanksgiving. Thanks for nothing Allegiant.

### "not pleased with this airline"
I flew from Greenville to Orlando and the plane got to the gate when we were supposed to start boarding, then they had to deplane and then clean the plane. It was a 45 minute delay which wasn't that big of a deal. The real problem when I was set to depart from Sanford. Apparently there was a weather advisory and no minor could get on the plane alone. I have never heard of this rule before, a flight attendant said that she would watch over me so I could go and I thought everything was ok, then when I start to board the agent said that the flight attendant has changed her mind and that I will have to find another flight. I pleaded to get on the plane because this was today December 22nd and I needed to get back to see my family. All in all I will have to wait until tonight to get another flight (which was 3 hours from my original destination.) I am not pleased with this airline and I do not plan on flying it again.

### "very happy with our flights"
We've flown on Allegiant a half dozen or so times and are very happy with every aspect of all our flights. When we flew in October, the incoming plane had mechanical issues in Fl, and our flight eventually was delayed overnight. Allegiant processed the full plane of passengers as quickly as they could and got anyone who had to travel over 30 minutes to get home put up in a local hotel. As we waited in line for our hotel vouchers, the crew passed out bottled water and chocolates and chatted with us to help ease the wait. In addition to a night in a hotel (which probably cost them more than what we paid for our flight to begin with!) we each got a $100 voucher for future travel - we are using it in January and will end up flying round trip from NH to FL for $13, plus the cost of picking our seats because my hubbs likes a window, and because of motion sickness, I need an aisle seat - and we both like the extra leg room seats. So for a grand total of $79, we have the seats of our choice and round trip fare. I find Allegiant customer service to be quite pleasant. The seats are as OK as most that I have had on other airlines - it's a 3 hour flight, I can sit in almost anything as long as I have room for my longish legs. All in all, we continue to fly Allegiant and are very happy with their rates, their service, and their airline in general. We are minimalist and can each fit what we need for a 10-12 day stay into a bag that conforms to Allegiant's standards for a free personal item that stows under the seat in front of us - but, having said that, if we needed to check bags, it would be more than worth the extra charge since parking at the terminal in Portsmouth, NH is free. If we were to go to Manchester or Boston to fly, we'd have to pay probably over $100 to park for 10-12 days

### "second rate at best"
The plane arrived 30 minutes late in Vegas. Then knowing that weather was bad at best in Rapid they took off about 1 hour late. At the time were to start descent into Rapid City, the pilot came on and announced we were diverted to Sioux Falls, SD. That is approximately 6 hours from Rapid City. That is further away than if we had stayed in Vegas. Our vehicle is still in Rapid. As we sit on the tarmac in Sioux Falls we are waiting for another plane to leave gate so we can get off plane. There has no been no disemmimation of information. I can't believe there is no plan that can be told to passengers. Allegiant is second rate at best.

### "had a great experience"
I had a great experience with Allegiant Air! Everyone was decent and cordial. The stewardesses were polite and so were the pilots. I did my part and arrived at the times I should and everything went smoothly. The seats were ok, I'm 5'8 and for the cost of the ticket I'm not complaining. I'm not the type of person who needs bells and whistles when I fly. I just want to get to my destinations safely. I should add I have a massive fear of flying and taking off scares me greatly. You can get your alcohol and snacks like with anyone else. So for anyone looking to book with Allegiant I say go for it, the money you save can be put towards better use on your vacation or drinks on the plane. BTW the price difference was about 200 bucks compared to other airlines for an adult and child.

### "very nice and comfortable"
I was nervous at first to fly Allegiant Air because I had never flown it before and I saw a lot of bad reviews of it . Though you get what you pay for, it's a really good value. So what If you have to pay for a snack and drink you can buy that before boarding. The staff was very nice. However flying home from Punta Gorda was kinda stressful. They had to switch out our plane because the other one broke but the new plane they gave us was great. Very nice and comfortable. It took no time at all for boarding. I will definitely fly Allegiant again.

### "there have been no surprises"
Personally, I've never had a horrible experience with Allegiant Air, and I've flown with them 3 years in a row for our annual trip from Grand Forks, ND to Orlando/Sanford, FL. The price is right, and my husband and I are able to pack both of our things in one suitcase, so we only have to pay to check one bag. You are allowed a personal item free of charge, so I normally use a backpack. I've never been cold on an allegiant flight, normally warm. Though temperature varies and that's to be expected with any airplane. I've never encountered a rude stewardess. In fact we've had the same male stewardess for all of our flights back from Florida, who is friendly and personable. Seats aren't the most comfortable, however I can deal with it for 3.5 hours. I always buy a few drinks from the airport, and pack snacks from home, so that I can avoid having to pay for something on the plane. Restrooms are fine. Overall, I've found that there have been no surprises. Just read the FAQ on their website and you'll know what to expect.

### "seats are the worst feature"
Flew Allegiant Air from Mesa, Arizona to Grand Rapids, Michigan. There are some outstanding features of Allegiant Air, such as being able to book your flight only a week out and still get a decent fare. That is their best quality. However they charge you for everything after the standard fare, for your seat selection, for insurance, for both checked luggage and a carry on, and they allot you only 40 pounds maximum, not 50. They give you no drinks and no snacks. I asked for a cup of water to refill my water bottle and was denied. Only water for medicine taking, I was told. The seats are the worst feature. They are hard molded plastic with no padding in the backs and little padding in the seat itself. I have osteoporosis and when I finished my four hour trip, I had knots in my upper back and aching muscles in my lower back. No matter what position you try, it is uncomfortable,. There is no elastic seat bag in front of you to hold things in, like your water or a pen or kleenex. Only an open hard plastic slot that is not enclosed. All food costs money. You are restricted from standing in line to use the bathroom and there is no way to get out your seat in time to make it there before someone else closer beats you out. You board the plane from a covered staircase in the outdoors. The seats are very narrow and anyone who is large or tall cannot help but spill over into your space, making for a cramped and painful position for hours. I think Allegiant needs to strip their interiors to the floor and get all new comfortable seats five across, not six, and their customers would come back instead of quit, like me.

### "you get what you pay for"
Meeting family for the holidays and needed the "best" rates to fly my family to California. The initial airfare was dirt cheap compared to other airlines, should have taken heed to that red flag. You not only get charged for every bag (except your purse) but they charge you for seating. I get an email to "pre-select my seats" so my family can sit together and there's a $13 fee per person just to select a seat? Not even a free bag with 5 peanuts in it or a cup of water to wash them down. Now I'm reading how people's flights are delayed and taking over 2 hours to retrieve their luggage. Not my definition of "best". Lesson learned - you get what you pay for with Allegiant Air.

### "Not worth it"
The outbound flight was delayed for about 2 hours due to a flat tire and someone from Allegiant had to be flown into OKC to fix it. The return flight to OKC arrived without incidence, but all passengers had to wait an hour and a half for their luggage to finally be put on the carousel. When the luggage finally arrived at baggage claim, my bag was not among the others. No one from Allegiant was anywhere to be found, of course. Finally, someone that worked in baggage claim for the OKC airport said that it was at the airport and would brought to the ticket counter but it would take another 20 minutes. I was finally able to leave the airport 2.5hr hours after my flight arrived - the same amount of time it took to fly from Las Vegas to OKC. Most passengers were stating that they would never fly Allegiant again during their 1.5hr wait for their luggage. Their fares are cheaper, but at what cost in the end? Not worth it.

### "Not satisfied at all"
I fly with Allegiant 5 times a year from Sanford Orlando to Plattsburgh New York. Every time I fly there is always a delay. Also I travel with a service dog and they were being rude trying to tell me I could not take my dog out when he is a service dog and I take him out every time I fly. They also charged me for my boarding pass, which they have never charged me before because I have to check in at the airport because of my service animal. Also they made me combine my purse to my backpack or they were not going to let me on the plane. Over all do not recommend flying with Allegiant. Not satisfied at all. Rude staff as well.

### "no customer service skills"
Trip started ok, with their first service out of MCI but the way back was a disaster. Me and a friend where on a quick getaway and on the same reservation number, both of us checked a bag ($40 each). Same time, an hour before departing. When we get to the gate, they are telling us to go to another gate, but the sign still said SC or something. So just word of mouth, from other customers, we did get on the right plane. Getting back to MCI, my friend got her bag, mine was not there. So I go to counter, no one working, called the number and reported it lost to Allegiant Air. Report was made Sunday, 11/15. That night around 10 pm, I receive a phone call from Stewart, NY, and I have left my bag there. No. It was the airport manager, not Allegiant. I have made numerous phone calls, emails, and still have no bag 11/24/15. They can give me no one else to call and no calls have been returned by them. I have the airport manager cell phone and he is the only one that has been helpful. You understand why their flights are so cheap, because they have no customer service skills and really could careless if you get your things.

### "decent service for the price"
Decent service for the price. Do not book anything but the flight on their site. I added a rental car since they would give a "special low rate". I found out it would have been much cheaper to rent direct from the agency, plus there was an additional $99 counter fee to get the car. No contact info on their site; wrote letter to Allegiant customer service, no response.

### "flights have been delayed"
Sanford to Cincinnati with Allegiant Air, and I have flown this airline 3 times this year - mostly because of the convenience even though their prices are generally lower also. All three times my flights have been delayed - at least one part and sometimes both parts of my round trip. I would rather pay more to know my arrival times are going to be accurate. This airline needs to get their act together.

### "definitely fly Allegiant again"
We were a little worried after hearing some stories from past customers regarding late or cancelled flights, but we were pleased with our experience. The base price of $93 round trip was the draw. Even with all the extra charges (seat selection, luggage charge, etc.) The total came to $233 for the 2 of us. When checking in on-line we opted to change to the front seats for and extra $6. The flight left and landed 15 minutes early! The Punta Gorda Airport is tiny (but growing) with only 6 gates. We didn't have to wait at all for our bags and parking is free. Our return trip to Pittsburgh did leave and land 30 minutes late. We would definitely fly Allegiant again.

### "more than satisfied"
My husband and I have been flying with Allegiant Air for over a year. Something like 6 round trips. We are more than satisfied with our experiences. The last time we flew in Oct, our 6:45 PM flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues with the plane before it left FL to come to NH. Although Allegiant employees rarely have flights cancelled, and are not regularly using the cancellation procedures, the Portsmouth staff treated us with respect and kindness. They made arrangements for us to be put up in a local hotel that offered free breakfast. They passed out bottles of water and Lindt chocolates as we waited in line. Allegiant had us on our way to Sanford early the next afternoon. The plane we flew down on, was a different one than we were originally booked on, and the extra leg room we paid for wasn't available. Allegiant credited that extra charge back to our debit card, and gave us each a voucher for $100 toward future travel. Considering we can book flights for $54 one way, that's a good deal in my mind. We are not employees of Allegiant, nor are we related in any way to any employees. We are 2 people who appreciate a good value. We have learned the art of minimal baggage and can get by for 10 days with what will fit in the free personal item that will fit under the seat. We pay a great rate for only what we use. That we appreciate. We are looking forward to our next travel with Allegiant Air

### "some of the best service"
First-time flyer and I'll be back! Allegiant is new to Fort Lauderdale, but the price was too good to pass up ($44 one-way to where I wanted to go at the last minute). Friends had warned me it might not be pleasant, but I gotta hand it to Allegiant. For about $120, they got me on time to where I wanted to go - far less than what I would have paid on a larger airline. And it was one of the best crews I've seen on any flight. Everyone gets the same seat on the A320, doesn't recline, no roomy pocket to store stuff. But the seat was comfy, and it got me there. Boarding was a breeze, they're very upfront about all the extras they charge for, so if you know that ahead of time, it's perfectly fine. The staff was great, some of the best service I've ever experienced. Everyone was friendly, helpful, even the captain came out and said goodbye as everyone was getting off the plan (both flights). A woman two seats over suffered from awful motion sickness on the return flight/landing, and the flight attendant was amazingly helpful. Got her an ice pack, stood there for about 10 minutes and fanned her with a safety card to cool her down, talked to her the whole time. Very wonderful service. I will fly again, especially if I need to save money to get from Point A to Point B.

### "first and last time I use"
First and last time I use Allegiant Air! Paid for a round trip. On my way to LAX on Thursday, the flight was scheduled to leave at 230 arriving at 340pm. The plane was delayed because of mechanic issues and it wasn't until hrs later that they decided to fly in another plane in which I lost a day on my trip because of this. Which I was ok with being that it was mechanical issues involved. Yesterday I decided since I'm traveling with my 18 month old I would check in online, checked my bags, paid for an extra bag and express boarding pass, etc. Once I arrived at the airport just to make sure I approached the counter where I was told my flight was delayed again. Took my time going upstairs to security. Once at security I was informed I needed to go back downstairs for a printed boarding pass since the online one didn't mentioned I was traveling with a lap child. Very irritating issue update the app so that information is available! Once again go to the counter tell her situation asked for my info again. Only to get "oh you're flying to Boise - that flight is on time! Long story short I ended up missing my flight because of not 1 but 2 people giving the wrong information even though they knew I was flying to Boise. The next plane I could board was on Thursday. Since they don't have a sister plane. No drinks or snacks provided unless you pay with a credit card. Very unhappy, upset and unsatisfied.

### "have always been satisfied"
Mesa Gateway to Williston, and I can't thank Allegiant Air enough! I had my service dog, they were so accommodating, and welcoming. The flight was on time both ways, the service couldn't be better. I have flown Allegiant before from the Midwest and have always been satisfied. I look forward to flying with them again over the Thanks Giving season!

### "I had a terrible flight"
Be aware that Allegiant Air is a low cost airline! I had a terrible flight, and be aware that you will be charged for everything, including printing your tickets. No food or drinks, only if you have a mastercard. If you have only cash they will let you starve. Be prepared, bring food and drinks! Dirty and narrow seats, single persons are seated in the middle on purpose before check in to make you pay for a change of seats. Plane was late for no reason both flights. It was all old,dirty and uncomfortable. I had problems with my legs for many days after the flight (I couldnt walk properly). Staff were quite unfriendly and mostly busy with running through the aisle with a garbage bag. No entertainment at all. I paid about 500USD for this inconvenient flight. Never again!

### "never fly Allegiant Air again"
Our returning flight was rescheduled from Sunday to Monday. There was very little warning, hardly any explanation, no compensation, and little communication. After we spent more money on hotels and made arrangements for family and jobs, they cancelled that flight as well. Supposedly they rescheduled the flight to Thursday. Not to mention, the first flight was over an hour delayed because of missing paperwork. Allegiant Air has put a huge damper on what was a wonderful trip. I will never fly Allegiant Air again no matter what cheap fare they advertise.

### "just lost a loyal customer"
Flight was cancelled and rescheduled for next day around lunch time. Reason for change given as weather. I had to arrive on the original flight day because of business. Was told I could reschedule in next 2 weeks but no refund. Had to book on another airline. Weather was beautiful at departing and arriving cities. They just lost a loyal customer. I saved $100 when I booked the original flight. But it cost me $400 for last minute flight because of their problem. Weather was not an issue for the other airlines!

### "experience has been just fine"
I have flown Allegiant Air several times and the experience has been just fine concidering the huge savings. My family of 4 flies to SW Florida for vacation each year and we can fly direct from our local airport 1.5 hour flight. Our latest trip ran $412 plus $140 for 2 checked bags. The next least expensive option was American. It would have been $2332 plus $100 for 2 checked bags. It also includes a connection in Charlotte and takes 4 hours. Nearly $1900 less. The difference is less than our vacation rental is for the entire week after taxes and cleaning. I always get my boarding pass online and check the bags with a sky cap. You just show your boarding passes on your phone to the gate and you're on the plane. Alot of people on here are saying they'd pay more for larger carrier and I have to say go ahead. I also can't agree that the airline nickel and dimes people. I'll happily pay less for things I don't need. As for the customer service, I never need anything from them so I let them do their job. Of course they're rude when people complain all the time about everything. You are getting a killer deal on a flight so get over it.

### "charge you for everything"
Allegiant Air lure you in with low cost fare, but then charge you for everything. You have to pay for your per seat assignment, carry on, checked baggage, your boarding pass if printed at the terminal will cost you $5, if you want a drink on your flight that will cost you $2. They only allow your checked bag to be 40 pounds so if you fly a major airline and then connect with Allegiant it you are going to be fined an additional $50 for that bag that weighs 50 lbs which is in compliance with the other airlines. It is a total nickle and dime operation. In the end I paid as much for their flight, perhaps even more, than flying a major airline. They even close their check in counter 40 minutes prior to boarding time, so if you're a tad late, you can't even get on the plane! Their boarding time is 1 hour prior to flight, rather than the normal 1/2 hour. Crazy business, I do not recommend flying with them.

### "last time I fly Allegiant Air"
This is the first time I've flown Allegiant Air and it will be the last time I fly Allegiant Air. The trip up to Portsmouth was uneventful. The return trip was a nightmare. We were told several times that our flight had been delayed before it was finally cancelled. It was not due to weather. We looked at their website and saw that there had been about 10 cancellations that day and also the day before. One flight out of Bellingham WA had been cancelled two days in a row. We read of a possible pilot's strike and since we needed to get home, we booked a return flight on Delta at a cost of $600.00. I have since read reviews about poor maintenance on their airplanes. Lower cost does not make up for unreliable service and a scary ride!

### "worst experience ever"
Worst experience ever. Had to pay $100 for a carry-on. Very uncomfortable seats. Customer service was horrible. I paid for a carry-on before the flight and was still charged $100 for my carry-on. They make you think you are getting a good deal and then charge you to take your purse on the flight. It's ridiculous! Don't fly with them.

### "last trip with Allegiant"
This was are third and last trip with Allegiant. It seems like they do nothing to improve their planes since we started flying with them. Our plane had a 4 hour delay due to repairs. Repairs? The seats look like they need to be replaced. The arm on one of them in our row didn't work. Heaven forbid if you can't use their site. You are the one that ends up paying out when you check in. Their employees don't have the ability to correct it. They can only do what their computers allow them to do. I noticed that their flight attendants don't look professional. They are kind. Got that going for them.

### "last two times have been terrible"
The last two times I have flown Allegiant have been terrible. Our flight from Las Vegas to Moline, IL was delayed over and over again. Finally they brought in a different airline to fly us home. We paid extra for my husband and I to sit together in reserved seats and we were put on opposite ends of the jet. Then we tried again in September 2015. Our flight was delayed several times then finally they boarded us only to have everyone unboard the jet. Waited another two or more hours and they finally cancelled the flight all together. We had to drive back home and arrived at 1:30 in the morning. The next night we flew out and not on the jet we were suppose to be on but at least we made it to Arizona. To come back home they had to put us on a new jet again and my this time we had eight of us in my family. They scattered us around the jet to fill in empty seats. Expected my grandsons (ages 2 and 3) to sit with strangers! It was horrible! I am so done with this airline. I understand some problems once in awhile but this was three times in a row for my family. No more!

### "big nickles and dimes"
Took a trip to Vegas with Allegiant Air. Backs of seats did not recline and felt like old wooden straight back chairs. Returned to Cedar Rapids ten minutes early, pilot said ground crew not available to deplane us at ramp. Updated couple of times no crew yet. Half an hour later pilot says "due to a miscommunication, we were supposed to be at a different gate" so he turned the corner and there were about a hundred people waiting for our plane to board and an entire ramp crew waiting to deplane us. Not to mention the nickle and dime (big nickles and dimes) fees for everything including economy seat selection and any bags, carryon included. By the time you add all the fees you could afford a better airline.

### "never utilize Allegiant again"
I have been a loyal Allegiant Air customer for years, several flights logged. I booked a flight to Youngstown Ohio online. Upon arriving to the airport I began to board when I was confronted by an employee regarding additional charges. After several discussions with airline employees and not wanting to ruin the visit, I paid the additional fee in protest. The "reasonable" flight had now exceeded the cost of a "nicer airline". I will make the best of this more expensive flight with less quality but I'm a man of principal and will never utilize Allegiant Air again.

### "an hour and a half to receive bags"
When we arrived in Lexington three days ago, it took us an hour and a half to receive our bags. Now we go to check in to go back home to Fort Lauderdale, and we have to pay Allegiant Air $10 for a boarding pass. Now we are waiting in the lobby because we can't check our bags until two hours before the flight. We think we do the right thing and now get penalized.

### "thank the staff at both ends"
On October 5th we were to fly from Allentown, Pa to Orlando Fla. We were to leave Allentown at 8:30pm. The flight was moved back to 12:10am October 6th, our plane was stuck in a storm in South or North Carolina. They had to bring a plane from the mid west to service Orlando then to Allentown and back to Orlando. We got free sodas, water, and they brought about 30 pizzas free for everyone. They kept everything open at both ends for us, car rentals etc. We arrived about 3:00 in Orlando. Everyone connected with the airline was super courteous and friendly even under trying conditions. I thank the staff at both ends and the flight crew.

### "a pleasant experience"
South Bend to St Pete–Clearwater. Overall, flying with Allegiant wasn't bad. Got me there in one piece, and crew were friendly. Our flight was delayed for an hour or so, but that's not too overwhelming. Overall, a pleasant experience.

### "they will take every last dollar"
I will never fly with Allegiant Air again. It was my second time with the company. The first time went okay but nothing to brag about. I am use to flying with Southwest or US. I found a cheap flight that was were I was needing to go. Lets just say they are cheap, but they will take every last dollar if any changes are needed. Even if you try to change the flight weeks in advance the charges end up being twice as much to change. My flight was $176 the changes were $290. Tell me how that works out My family has chosen to change to another airlines for a large family trip coming up. We figured paying the little extra for convenience and customer service is well worth it.

### "flight attendants were professional"
I was hesitant to use Allegiant Air because of the poor reviews but decided to try it because of the incredible price. My husband and I both flew the same route 2 weeks apart. His flight was slightly delayed landing but only by a few minutes. Both of my flights were on time. I had no issues and we will definitely fly this airline again. I see people complaining about buying refreshments on the flight. This can be avoided by buying a drink after you go through security and bringing snacks from home if you don't want to buy the snacks. This flight was $400 cheaper than the other airline. I booked within 1 week of the flight. The flight attendants were professional and it was an enjoyable flight.

### "recommended friends and family to fly it"
I fly Allegiant Air round trip a minimum of 4 times a year and have recommended friends and family to fly it as well when they come to Florida to visit. Only on 1 occasion was the flight delayed and that was a trip leaving Memphis to Sanford. I have flown in and out Springfield, Bloomington, and Belleville. I do not know why anyone would complain about paying for a beverage or a snack when the flight rates are so affordable compared to other airlines. I have found the total price is more affordable even when you pay for luggage, snacks, and a seat than the major airlines. I love the direct flight since you do not have to worry about luggage being transferred to a different plane or hurry to a concourse so you don't miss your connecting flight. I have found the flight attendants to be very kind and accommodating. It would be more convenient if they flew out of each town daily in the event a flight was cancelled. We have choices with Allegiant and can control to a degree the amount we spend and I have chosen to fly Allegiant.

### "seems they just hate their jobs"
I have traveled Allegiant Air many times since it is a non-stop flight and I bring no luggage. The process with Alleigant is always awful. The planes are most uncomfortable, at least the ones we fly. The flights are late, and about 1 out of every 2 times flights are delayed because the crew is late or the plane is late or the plane just has mechanical problems and they cancel your flight. That makes it really bad since they only fly certain days. I will finally just give up and use another airline and pay the extra $'s and drive a little farther. I say use only if you have to. If you do get a flight the attendants are rude. It just seems they just hate their jobs.

### "a great saving value ticket"
Allegiant Air offers a great saving value ticket compared to the other airlines. All the website details were very clear, regarding allowed sizes of the luggage and the 5$ fee in case you didn't make your booking before you arrive to the airport, etc. The staff were friendly and  helpful, the airplane was clean and  had comfortable seats. If you want a snack you can bring your own or buy one from them. The only bad thing about this airlines is that it has limited destinations in the US, wished that it goes to other states.

### "overall I wouldn't recommend Allegiant"
Coming to Abe just 1 hour prior to to my flight, the airport was almost empty and security was a breeze. Just remember that with Allegiant Air if you check in and get your boarding pass at the airport, you will have to pay 5$. Also note that you have to pay a fee up to 35$ just to use the overhead bins! So basically the only thing you can bring on a plane for free is a small personal item that will fit in the seat in front of you. On my flight from Abe (Lehigh Valley) to Myrtle Beach, the flight was delayed about 2 hours because of technical issues on an outdated MD-80. Once on the plane, the seats were comfortable, even though they had pretty tight legroom. On the way back, our flight departed 5 minutes early amd was on time, however this time on a much newer A320. With tickets being cheap, there's not much included on your ticket since it's cheap, like complimentary drinks on other airlines, so overall I wouldn't recommend Allegiant.

### "a good experience with Allegiant Air"
We had a good experience with Allegiant Air. Flight from FLL was delayed about an hour due thunderstorms, lightning in the area, and some airport related fueling issues but nothing the fault of the airline. No big deal to us, we were coming off a cruise and were in no rush anyway. The plane we flew on was a freshly refurbished A320 originally from Iberia and looked very fresh with new paint, interior, and seats. The slimline seats aren't bad for a couple hour flight (I'm 6'0") and as long as you learn how to fly and pack for the discount airlines like Allegiant Air or Frontier you won't be shocked when you either book or arrive at the airport. Do your research and read before you book and they'll get you from point A to B which in reality is all we needed. Flew Frontier on the way down to FLL and it was a similar experience and seats. Only difference I noticed was that Frontier provides you with free cups of ice water where as Allegiant asks you to pay for even that but thats a non issue to us. Flight crew was nice and pilot was humorous during his announcements. All in all as I mentioned before if you simply do your homework and know what to expect on low cost airlines you should not have any reason to complain and they'll get you where you need to go.

### "we will never fly Allegiant Air again"
We will never fly Allegiant Air again. I used to suggest this airline to my friends and family in and from Rockford, IL because they fly directly from Rockford to the east valley and spared us the drive from Chicago. Let me tell you, the drive from Chicago is well worth it if you don't have to deal with this awful excuse of an airline. For some stupid reason, my husband and I decided to use Allegiant Air for a trip back to Rockford, IL for my grandmother’s 90th birthday. We had been planning this trip for a year. Both my husband and I are veterans so I have flown in everything from a 4-seater plane, a 12 seat passenger plant, a C-5 Galaxy, to a large civilian plane from Kuwait to Amsterdam to Chicago. In all that time I have never come close to experiencing such incompetence and poor customer service as I did when attempting to fly with this joke of an airline. Having used this airline a few times, I knew that check in and security took approximately 15-20 minutes, which was a good thing considering there are no amenities in the airport for your wait after check in except for some vending machines. We arrived at the long term parking about an hour and a half before our flight. We watched two buses pass us right by until we ran after one and caught it before it left us as well. That wait cost us almost 30 minutes. When we arrived at the check in gate there were no other passengers in line. We arrived at the ticket counter and the girl at the desk said she could print out our boarding passes but it would cost and extra $5 each. That’s not a huge deal, but she said she could download the app on my phone and we wouldn’t have to pay the fee. We weighed our bags and had to move some things around to make weight. The girl at the desk suggested different ways to move things about and was telling anecdotes about overweight bags and such and didn't seem in any rush at all. Then she started messing with my phone to download the app for the free boarding pass. Once again, there was no sense of urgency or warning. This process took about 15 minutes. Once she finished with my phone, she informed us that it was now too late to print our boarding pass and we wouldn’t be able to board the plane. She said Allegiant Air had a policy that they stopped printing boarding passes 40 minutes before the flight. Our flight was at 1:51 and the time when she told us this was 1:13, meaning it was 38 minutes before our flight. We were literally denied our flight because of 2 minutes and the plane was still sitting in the tarmac! Allegiant Air flights are delayed, so there was even more available time than that. We would have been able to make the flight if she had just told us that we didn’t have time to mess around with the stupid phone app and our luggage beforehand! We brought this up and she tried to tell us that we were too late when we walked up to the desk. Um, if it was too late at that point, then why in the world did she tell us to download the app and mess around with our luggage? Shouldn't she have told us that as soon as we walked up to the counter instead of chatting away for another 15 minutes? She said that we could reschedule for the following Monday for $75 per person. That means we would miss my grandmother’s birthday.

### "worst customer service of any airline in US"
Allegiant Air has perhaps the worst customer service of any airline in the US. Gate agents are not friendly or helpful. They can not adjust baggage fares or do anything outside of shoving you on the plane. When you need assistance you are handed a piece of paper with a phone number to call. When you call, you have a minimum 30 minute wait to speak to a human. This is particularly frustrating when there are 4 helpless human agents standing in front of you. After you pay all of their fees, it really isn't any cheaper than one of the bigger, more reliable and better customer service airlines. Don't waste your time or money with Allegiant Air.

### "experience with Allegiant Air was good"
I thought the experience with Allegiant Air was good and everything was very easy and on time. I booked through their website (roundtrip, rental car, hotel) for a stay of 4 nights for a total of USD 397 including everything. The airport out of St Pete is small and very easy to navigate, not crowded when I went. I would say the price is decent, I stayed at a 3.5 star hotel and got a nice rental car. The food and beverage offered on the plane is limited, but nothing to complain about. I would recommend for a cheaper alternative that is comfortable and safe.

### "telephone customer service was very good"
I liked my flight with Allegiant Air, they worked with me on changing my flight and the telephone customer service was very good. However, the customer service they have at the gate was subpar, the staff seem disgruntled and pretty much ignored me when I tried asking a question.

### "I can certainly recommend this airline"
My wife and I flew down to Naples for the weekend and Allegiant was the only direct flight from Raleigh/Durham. We were a little apprehensive after ready some reviews but they saved us over $800 for the same flight with other airlines and 3-5 hours of flight time. Yes, we had to get picked up at the airport as our destination was Naples, but it was only 30 minutes farther than Ft. Meyers. The flight was perfect, the seating was comfortable and the staff was friendly. I can certainly recommend this airline to anyone flying from Raleigh to the 3 destinations in Florida.

### "all I ask of an airline these days"
Overall I was satisfied with Allegiant Air. After reading reviews I realized I would not be saving any money compared to another airline (they do charge for absolutely everything on top of the apparently cheap fare) however I still chose them because they were flying direct from our small local airport, at a time of day that was convenient for me. Crew was friendly and efficient. They walked us through the process of doing a few things on our Iphone right at the airport, instead of making us pay for them to do it (like printing boarding passes for instance, and checking in more luggage). So yes, they were aware that the airline charges for a lot of stuff but they were more than happy to show us ways to cut down on our spending a bit. Aircraft was fairly new. No bells and whistles: very basic seats that do not recline, and no personal TV monitor. Oh well, it was a 2.5 hour flight, and I was not expecting anything luxurious. I was just happy to get to my destination safely and on time. That's pretty much all I ask of an airline these days, especially at this price! No problem with baggage delivery. Note: they do not offer a plastic bag to wrap your baby car seat in.

### "sat in a freezing cold airport for several more hours"
First flew Orlando to New Orleans in July with Allegiant Air. The pilot came in to land, sped up and took off again. Came on the intercom after several minutes and said all was normal. Next flight, Indianapolis to Orlando in Sept. Plane to depart at 8 pm, started boarding at a little after 7. Sat on the plane for 2 hours before departing gate. While backing out of gate a loud noise was heard, plane went back to gate where we sat for another 2 hours waiting for mechanics. Finally asked to get off the plane. Sat in a freezing cold airport for several more hours, along with about 140 other passengers, many of which were infants and small children. Flight cancelled, $8 vouchers handed out for food, but nothing open in the airport by then. Hotel vouchers given out, but most hotels they contracted with were full, or had no shuttles. We ended up paying for our own hotel, and we were finally able to get a room in at 1.30 am. Gate people were very nice and did everything in their power to help. My spouse and I did receive a total of $200 in flight vouchers. The plane took off the next day, late, but an uneventful flight. Delays are one thing, but safety issues quite another, and mechanical issues seem to come up in almost all of the passenger reviews that I have read.

### "fee is more important than the customer"
The one good thing I can say about Allegiant Air is that I found their staff and crew to be friendly. But that is it. We experienced mechanical issues on both the departing and return flights. Our return was delayed by 2 hours because they had no mechanic on duty. Allegiant Air does not follow industry standards with regards to baggage weights. Instead of the standard 50 pounds for checked luggage they use 40 pounds as the maximum. An overage by even one pound incurs a $50 fee. Although all airlines are now charging fees, it is obvious that for some, like Allegiant Air, the fee is more important than the customer.

### "do not care about the customer"
$400 flight is really a $700 plus flight By the time you pay all the add on fees to your $400 flight it ends up being $700 plus! Charges for using a credit card $23, what else can you use?Checked bag $40-50, some carrier usage fee another $22, fees to pick a seat, thought it was a given you would be in a seat, check in fees at airport. This was bad enough but when the flight was delayed 4.5 hours with several different stories, they lost total credibility with me. Attendants at the gate all gave me different stories, an $8 dinner voucher, that might get you 1/2 a burger if you are lucky, here at the terminal. Allegiant Air do not care about the customer, it's all about the company, my absolute last flight with these guys.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Allegiant Air flight from Orlando to Austin was 1.5 hours late and return flight was 2 hours late. Really messed up my plans. Airline was not even apologetic, their attitude is - at least the flight will go out. Just been used to having much better service. However the price was better on Allegiant Air, but expect issues.

### " $400 tickets ended up at $700"
I have flown with this airline many times. I have never had any issues with the services until now. When I booked our last fights you see the ticket prices and think, that's a good or reasonable deal. You pay for every single aspect of the entire flight. You pay for your ticket in the following ways: two people traveling round trip- two tickets per person each way (180ish) okay reasonable, must pay approx $20 per seat per flight to pre select your seat (even in middle seat! ), must pay for all checked bags, only allowed one carry on not two like other airlines, then pay $22 to pay for the tickets at check out to use a card. Then you have to pay $5 per person per flight to check in at the airport. So our would be $400 tickets ended up right at $700 after fees (and we only checked 1 bag and downloaded the app to avoid $20 more bucks in boardig pass fees). Ridiculous!

### "had no issues"
I was anxious prior to flying with Allegiant Air because of all the bad reviews. Flew round trip and had no issues with either flight. Both were on time and crew was friendly. Definitely no frills, but you get what you pay for.

### "does what it says"
I don't understand all the bad reviews? This airline does what it says. It gets you from point A to point B for a fraction of the big airline prices. I had a direct flight with not having to go through Atlanta airport. Thats what ppl should complain about it's a madhouse. As far as my flight it was perfect departed on time (that's never happened on other aircrafts I've flown in the past) so what if you have to buy your drinks etc for the price who cares to spend 2.00 extra on a flight. My boyfriend and I flew for $224 that's including checking a bag and paying to sit together big deal. Other airlines were well over $1000. The staff were very friendly. I have nothing but good things to say. Give it a try for short flights.

### Allegiant Air customer review
This is my first time flying Allegiant, and I'm not impressed. I had to pay for baggage when I made my reservation, which was $50 for a checked bag. They also charge for carry-ons. Luckily, my fiancé and I just shared 1 checked bag to try to save money. We flew a different airline to Las Vegas but flew Allegiant on the way back. The other airline didn't weigh our bag because we paid one flat fee for our checked bag. Well Allegiant did weigh our bag and it weighed 51 pounds and they charged us another $50 so our 1 checked bag cost us $100 which was the cost for one of our plane tickets, which is outrageous. Other airlines usually only charge $25 and another $25 if it's over 50 pounds. Also, not to mention they do not offer a complimentary beverage. I will not be flying Allegiant again anytime soon.

### Allegiant Air customer review
This was my first time flying Allegiant Air. Wasn't sure what to expect but I was very plesed with the experience. At Niagara Falls we were late, just 20 minutes before departure but they accepted checking bags at plane door and moved it to cargo without extra charge. On the way back, my Allegiant Air app didn't work. Showed some secured connection issue (have to open browser and accept conditions). The counter agent said since I have the Allegiant Air app, he believes that I had boarding pass, saved me $20.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I have flow this flight between Las Vegas and Reno many times. They're always late. This time now, we're on the plane that for the first time arrived early, however we're waiting on paper work. The AC has been turned off and we're waiting in the Las Vegas sun. Cooking. The staff don't seem care, just as they always do.

### Allegiant Air customer review
If you go to the University of Oregon or OSU, this is pretty much your only way to LA for cheap. I never actually had any major problems, but a few minor issues. After flying them about 3-4 times last year to come home, I quickly learned it is the same pilot and first officer, sometimes flight crew. They are all incredibly nice and even joke around with the 95% college student-filled flights.However, when I was flying home in May, my plane was supposed to leave at 9.26am for LAX. The night before at approximately 11.45pm, I get a call saying the plane is delayed two hours due to mechanical problems. I get to the airport the next morning and it is delayed another hour because the plane was delayed in SFO for weather-related issues. Finally board the plane and didn't have any issues. When I arrived for my flight back to EUG, it was delayed about 20 minutes, but had us board the plane anyway. The pilot tells us they were adding more gas just in case we are diverted to Portland which is 3 hours from Eugene. We sat on the tarmac for another hour before departing and getting to Eugene safely.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We were delayed, but not too bad. Rental car was on site for a small airport, however, I found rental car prices a bit higher than rental car prices at RSW (Ft. Myers). Was going to fly with them again recently when I saw ad for $72 to Ft. Myers, but by the time they added $119 fee onto the ticket, it was more than Southwest. Plus their baggage fee of $40 is quite high, and Southwest has no baggage fee. I'll stick with Southwest or Spirit when it flies in season to Ft. Myers.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I have to admit after reading all the articles, I was a bit nervous flying Allegiant but my experience was a very positive one. We had to wait a bit to check in, but it wasn't too long or too bad. Staff were courteous, helpful and cheerful. This is no frills airline and one should investigative all add on charges. They don't serve complimentary soft drinks or snacks and you do have to pay for carry ons, but the overall savings was a plus. I would fly with Allegiant again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flight was meant to leave at 8:30 - got call at 5 to say it was delayed 2 hrs. Upon arrival found out flight was cancelled and new flight was at 10:30 the next morning. Local area was sold out for hotel rooms and finally found one 65 miles away. Got up early next morning to make 10:30 flight only to find it was delayed 4 hours. Made no sense as the plane from day before was still sitting waiting. Crew was sitting on floor of gate area waiting to access the plane. Their only concession was we were offered one bottle of warm water for our troubles (they had no ice). Cost me an extra $250, 200 extra miles and extra day on rental car. Filed claim but zero response. I have flown 6 flights with them and 4 had major delays or problems. Never again never which is a shame as they are only airline that flies nonstop from LAX to FSD

### Allegiant Air customer review
Pay more money for a reputable airline. Flight delayed 5 hours which means we lost 1 evening of our 3 day vacation. They made no announcement to inform people or give updates, until a customer requested it. No customer service at all.

### Allegiant Air customer review
To start off each leg I flew was delayed about 2 hours because of maintenance issues. The seats are very uncomfortable and the service is terrible. From what it costs for the ticket plus adding a bag you might as well take Southwest.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Very difficult for a UK resident to quickly comprehend this airlines status but if I was to say this Airline makes Ryanair look positively awesome then that will give you some indication of where this outfit rank. We took what was meant to be a 45 minute flight approx from Vegas to Fresno, 1.30 pm McClaren departure only to land 22.45 with what must be approx 200 other passengers. All of whom were deplaned twice, made to sit hours in a non a/c aircraft whilst the company did their utmost to not only lose customers but I think crew members also. To add insult to injury after the second deplaining customers were told to go to a different unmanned desk for meal vouch urge that arrived to coinside with most of the concessions closing except Burger King. To say communication was poor was being kind. All I would say to UK clients thinking of using this low cost domestic carrier is think again, with the exception of $8 dollars for food for my family of four apparently as a UK customer who spent over $1000 on the tickets I can get $200 against my next Allegiant flight.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Both of my flights were delayed. The second of which was delayed several hours. I know it's a budget airline so you really do expect to pay for everything extra, but once you add everything together it really isn't much cheaper than a regular airline. After my flight was delayed multiple times they finally let us on the airplane, but because it was so late their app wouldn't work for my boarding Pass. I then had to stand to the side while others boarded, even though I paid for priority boarding. I was scolded by the flight attendant for not taking a screenshot of my boarding pass. When I walked into the airplane it was not air-conditioned at all and they said they were having trouble with air-conditioning. It was at least 90°. The plane was filthy with trash everywhere. We ended up delayed again while on the plane and they told us there were mechanical issues. Needless to say I ended up not flying with them that day. I did however end up at a major airport on a major airline. Never again. It isn't worth the time, delays, and money saved to deal with them.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We have absolutely no complaints and would fly with them again. We did not encounter any delays, cancellations, and hidden fees like other reviews stated. Having said that Allegiant only flys the Pittsburgh to Myrtle Beach route seasonally. I don't know if that's possibly why we did not encounter any problems. As far as the free personal item that can be carried on and worrying with measurements I didn't even see any employee even concerning themselves with measuring anything that was carried on.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Was supposed to leave Vegas at 8.03 and have a quick 2 hour flight. Opted out of paying to check a bag so I just paid the 9 dollars to take a carry on bag. Flight left as scheduled, flew for 30 minutes and then a Gauge stopped working, so they turned around and went back to Vegas. Said they would either have it fixed or an answer in 30 minutes. Finally at 9.30 they said they would be working on it to repair and print food ticket vouchers for everyone at 10 if it still wasn't fixed. 10 am and went 10.30 came and went with still no word. 11 they finally said wait 30 minutes and they would start loading the plane. 11.30 loaded half the plane and then unloaded it as something still wasn't right. At 12 12 they gave food vouchers, good for a whole 8 dollars. The whole time the flight crew were rude, no explanation, nothing. Finally got word that the new plane would be in at 1.30 and we would be on it. Finally at 2.30 we leave. They did give 50 dollar voucher, good for one year on an Allegiant flight. I'll never fly with them again so that's a waste.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Delays, no communication, no responsibility - the list is endless. We could have driven to Las Vegas and back from Fresno on Sunday, August 16. Instead, we sat at the airport with a non-communicative and surly ground crew until they simply disappeared. Online flight Status was comical. You will make a mistake flying, no I should say "waiting for" Allegiant to fly.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I bought tickets on Allegiant because their prices looked lower than other tickets. They charge extra for each checked bag and also say they will charge for carry ons. They didn't actually charge us for carry on bags. Our flight out of LAX was delayed for 2 hours and they never apologized or gave a reason. On our 5+ hour flight, they charge for any food or beverage. They won't even give you water - it's $2. Also, the seats are crammed so close together your knees touch the seat in front of you and I'm 5' 9" tall. The seats do not recline. The flight attendants were not very friendly. My seat had something wrong with it and was fairly uncomfortable as well. The plastic form that the thin cushion attached to was bent or something. Also, in order to book a seat number, you have to pay extra as well. I think by the time I was done paying all their extra fees, I would have done much better on a different airline.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Starting with baggage check - A long line at baggage check, three ladies working check in, but nobody was being checked in. Why? Because apparently they couldn't start checking our flight in for another 10 minutes. Keep in mind that they were just sitting there, doing nothing. Just waiting until 12.36pm so they could start checking people in. Meanwhile the line gets longer and longer and that's just the beginning. The rest of the flight, the delays, etc - awful.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I used this airline to book a flight to Las Vegas for my bachelorette party. My flight was delayed by almost a whole day. This airline is ridiculous and refuses to help its customers for wasting their time. I tried numerous times to get some sort of compensation for having wasted a whole day because of their problems. My friend from Michigan was able to make it into Vegas despite the storm but, Allegiant, being the terrible airline that it is, couldn't deliver. So if you want to get where you're going, spend the extra money with a real airline and save yourself the headache.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Leaving LAX was 45 minutes late and then upon returning 3 days later, there was 4 delays, a cancellation, and then 4 more delays. Missed my 52nd wedding anniversary with my family. We did receive one cold piece of pizza and warm coke for our anniversary from them. Thanks Allegiant for a memorable anniversary.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Tried Allegiant Air for the first time, loved the direct flight. This is a "shopping" experience for sure when you book, you purchase everything separately, I did end up saving about $125 but it really wasn't worth it in the long run. Two hour delay (not weather related) which really screwed us up. Paid for one suitcase, but their weight limit was at 40 pounds, not the usual 50-and that ten pounds made a big difference-had to pay $5 each for boarding passes because we couldn't get their app to download on our phones, which was suspicious to me, since it was both of us unable to use it. I at least want some water on a flight without having to pay for it. So liked the direct flight, but reading the other reviews, we were not alone with what seems like a lot of delayed flights due to staff/plane management issues.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I was very disappointed with Allegiant Air's professionalism and customer service. After being delayed 7 hours due to weather they canceled our flight due to a flight crew duty time limitation. Our flight was rescheduled for the next afternoon, but we missed a day of our bachelorette party in Las Vegas. Allegiant customer service were rude and uncooperative on the phone. They offered no vouchers or help for our lost time. I understand that the initial delay was due to weather, and nothing can be done about that. However the cancellation was due to flight crew hours and should have been monitored more closely.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Unfortunately being from the UK I had never come across Allegiant Air before. The upfront airfare was cheap but then they get you with charges for, baggage, hand baggage, boarding card. The baggage allowance was a pitiful 18kg (39lb). The aircraft was grubby, the seats were very uncomfortable and the air crew were surly. No inflight entertainment and no complimentary refreshments. Avoid unless you really don't mind budget meaning basement level quality.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I do not recommend flying Allegiant Air if there is any other airline. We arrived at the airport on time, flight was scheduled to depart on time, 1.34pm Florida time. We all boarded the plane and one of the flight attendants passed out and that caused a 45 minute delay, then we leave the gate to find that there is a mechanical issue with our plane, 90 minutes later we are at the runway taking off. We were in flight for 1 hour and was told we had to turn around and return as another mechanical error had occurred and we had to change planes. The flight that was to leave at 1.34 ended up not officially leaving Florida until 7.00pm causing us to have been on a plane for over 7 hours for a 2 hour flight. So take your chance if you wish but I for one will find an alternative to this airline.

### Allegiant Air customer review
The counter staff at Pittsburgh were very nice, but it took more than 45 minutes to check in as the majority of the time there was only one staff member to check in the entire flight. The flight home was a different story. The staff at the counter were rude from the start. We had no opportunity to print our boarding passes, used the online service on their website and they refused to use them and charged us to print our boarding passes. My husband, who is disabled, was not able to carry his one personal bag and his cousin carried it for him. They told him that he would be charged if he carried it, even after he explained that is was for his cousin - who is clearly disabled and was at the counter. They did not care. Additionally, his wife was carrying a bag of snacks for us to eat while we were waiting for the flight. One of the counter staff said that he was going to charge her for that, even though she explained and they followed her to the gate and said something regarding it two more times. Finally, their baggage limits make no sense - a 125 lb person has the same limits as a 300 lb person. I will never fly this airline again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My flight from Los Angeles to Montrose, Colorado was my first time flying the airline and it will be my last. Our flight on 8/7/15 from LAX to MTJ was delayed over 3 hours. The issue seemed to be mechanical. It was very confusing when the screen at the gate did not have the updated departure time despite the fact that passengers were receiving text message flight alerts with delayed flight times. At one point the screen at the gate even said "now boarding" which was obviously incorrect. When I asked a gate agent which information was accurate, they were not helpful and did not seem to be informed. My flight from MTJ (Montrose) on 8/10/15 was delayed 7 hours. We were told that the plane departed Los Angeles to come to Montrose and had to divert to Arizona for repairs. I should have just assumed that the flight would be delayed and waited to go to the airport. I want an airline to fix the necessary repairs on a plane that I'm about to fly, but it is unnerving when the repairs are happening while you wait for the very same plane. It would be much more efficient if the planes were constantly maintained so that these long wait times would not be necessary. I also think it is ridiculous to charge a customer for a cup of water on a flight when they've been waiting in a very small and very hot airport for over 7 hours.

### Allegiant Air customer review
First time flying this airline. Couldn't beat the deal to get to Orlando for family vacation. On the way down - no problems. Had the bulkhead seats and were quite comfortable. Was a little surprised by the request to clean the area and set the seat belts for the crew. On our way home I was asked to remove my earbuds (not plugged into anything) before takeoff. This was quite surprising as I was using them as earplugs to drown out the sound of the young child behind me who was throwing a fit and kicking the seats. After I took out my earbuds I covered up with my wrap and tried to get some rest (it was an early morning). The attendant tapped me on my shoulder while I was sleeping to ask if my seatbelt was fastened - and he had just been there to see that it was fastened and my earbuds were out. Not a happy or comfortable flight for me.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Should my departure flight not have been delayed one hour, we would not have had to spend an additional 1.5 hours on the ground due to weather. My return trip was also delayed one hour and there were no weather related incidents - just poor management from this airline. On the return trip we were asked to general maintain the aircraft upon arrival at IWA. It wasn't much but isn't this why we pay so much for the airfare and two dollars for a glass of water? I couldn't wait to get off the aircraft before they asked me to vaccuum the floors. I thought I'd give Allegiant Air a try but will never use their services again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Not only were the flights extremely late, the staff and crew were very rude. When we arrived in Wichita at 5.00 pm for a 7.04 flight, we ultimately waited until 1.50 am on August 3, 2015 to board the flight to return to Phoenix-Mesa. The employees who occasionally appeared were so young that they found it more important to horse around up and down the jetways and ignore the requests for information from the passengers. Even the hostesses on board were rude to passengers. Their "strength" - flying directly into small towns - isn't worth the aggravation. I would definitely choose another airline next time, even if it means flying somewhere else prior to arriving at my destination.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I flew Allegiant for the first time thinking "even with some bad reviews, I am sure my flight will go smoothly without many hurdles. Not only was my flight delayed 3.5 hours going to my location, but delayed 6 hours going back home from my location. Passengers will given little to no information.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flight was supposed to leave at 3.38. Flight was delayed by two hours. When they finally decided to give us information they said we would board in five minutes. 30 minutes later still nothing. After an hour they told us the flight was delayed even longer due to mechanical issues. After waiting they decided to cancelled the flight until the next morning. All we were given was an eight dollar voucher for food. Steer away from Allegiant.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Our flight out of Pittsburgh was delayed due to a mechanical problem with the aircraft. The gate agents tried their very best to keep everyone informed. It was a very long delay, we were scheduled to leave early morning and never departed until very late evening. They eventually re-routed another plane to Pittsburgh to fly us to Jacksonville. Delays and mechanic problems can happen, I wouldn't want to fly on a questionable aircraft. I believe Allegiant did all that they could do, things just happen. We were given water and snacks at the gate while we all waited and thank goodness for the great nearby bars/restaurants in the airport. Allegiant is a low cost budget carrier, so, you get want you pay for. A no frills airline. How can you complain even with the long delay, (mechanical problems and weather) do happen, the airlines doesn't have control over those things. For the cost of the flights, even with the carry on and boarding fees you can't beat their prices. You need to understand, that Allegiant does not have co-shares with the major airlines so they cannot put you on another flight with another airline, so you are stuck and have to wait for them to fix the problem. I'm sure they don't want unhappy customers any more than we want to be unhappy customers. I say give them a try, do plan extra time and remember, you are flying for a very low fare, decide if paying triple on a major airlines for the same flight is worth it. Our return flight was on time and very pleasant.

### Allegiant Air customer review
After a 2 hour delay in leaving Las Vegas we arrived in Indianapolis for a change of planes to Orlando. After 3 hours of poor communication from Allegiant staff, we were finally told that there was a problem with lavatory hot water issues and computer problems that we had expirenced earlier in Las Vegas. The no refund exchange policy of this airline has caused us nothing but grief from these people. What appeared to be an economical trip turned into anything but. I can't understand how they can continue to get away with the shoddy business practices without any recourse. We are finished doing business with Allegiant and will never ride them again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I fly Allegiant Air a lot to see my family in Florida. I can justify some of what they do, no free pop or snacks, charging for seats, checked bags. But what I can't understand is the level that they take their fees to. $5 for a boarding pass? $30 for a carry on? This airline forgot what brought them: Good service and inexpensive prices. I will continue to fly them because they are the cheepest and the flight is non-stop. You get what you pay for.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I just returned August 3, 2015 on Allegiant Air where I experienced a 22 hour delay due to mechanical issues. Our flight was supposed to leave Kalispell at 9pm on Sunday, August 2nd. We were told that the plane was delayed so we sat in the airport and waited. We were finally told after 2 hours that the flight was cancelled and we would have to get a hotel for the night. We were instructed to come back to the airport in the morning. This was a joke because they had to fly in the part they needed to fix the plane. We finally arrived at our hotel at 1 am and then returned to the airport at 8 am. We had to wait for Allegiant staff to arrive at the airport. By 11 am we were informed that the flight was again delayed until 6 pm. The staff were unapologetic about the entire situation. We finally departed at 7pm, 22 hours after our original departure time.

### Allegiant Air customer review
(I previously reviewed Allegiant regarding my flight to MB, 7/25/15.) My flight home was scheduled 11.33am, Sat 8/1. Arrived at the airport and received a text that the flight was delayed until 12.03, then 12.33. Flight was finally boarded very late and it was extremely hot onboard, no AC. The flight attendants made some normal announcements, pilot says there is choppy air over NC, then plane shuts down. This happens 3-4x over the next hour. After over an hour, we are deplaned and told to stay at the gate and wait for an announcement as to when the plane would be fixed. Several times the employee makes an announcement that "we will know something soon". Finally they make the announcement that the flight is cancelled. They were rescheduling us for Sun 8/2, at a time to be later determined. Watch your email is all we were told. This is a Saturday night in Myrtle Beach, no hotels to be found, I was traveling with my mother and teenage daughter. There was no help with hotels. We had to find transportation, get a room, necessity toiletries, dinner etc. Only to find out that we were not scheduled to fly out again until 7.05pm Sun 8/2. This was a 32 hour delay. Such a frustrating experience.

### Allegiant Air customer review
On Saturday August 1, 2015 my 1.28 pm flight was delayed to 2.31, then delayed to 3.02, then delayed to 4.28. When a plane was finally available it could not accommodate all the passengers. They asked for volunteers to give up their seats which I did. Getting my luggage retuned was a challenging 70 minute wait. I believe the flight finally took off around 6 pm. The next day, the same flight was scheduled for departure at 5.27 pm. It was delayed to 6.29, then delayed to 8pm, then delayed to 8.55. Departure finally occurred approximately 10.15 pm.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We flew Allegiant and they left us stranded after midnight in Ontario CA. I was traveling with my 10 year old son and 18 month old daughter. This was after they delayed our flight, flew us around LAX for a while then landed in Ontario to refuel and left us sitting on the tarmac for over 3 hours. No apologies, no trying to make things better. You will need to email someone for help. Allegiant's pricing is deceiving by the time you add in all the baggage, boarding pass fees etc.. They have been less than helpful and offered little to no assistance or information.

### Allegiant Air customer review
It is now very obvious why Allegiant's pricing is so economical. I guess as with everything else in life you get what you pay for. Apparently they do not know how to schedule their pilots efficiently and therefore have to cancel flights when they don't have a pilot for the flight that you paid for. To make matters worse, they cannot tell you when your flight will be. So now we are stranded in Raleigh, North Carolina waiting for either a phone call or text message to let us know when our flight will be. They refused to offer any assistance for hotels for the night and say they do not do that despite the fact that this is an Allegiant problem, not mine. They have been less than helpful and offered little to no assistance or information as to when and how I will be getting home from my vacation. So we will continue to sit and wait on Allegiant to figure out what they're going to do to get us home and until then we're stranded in Raleigh.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flight and rental car were both booked through Allegiant. The flight from Cincinnati was delayed due to someone inadvertently deploying an emergency shoot. It took over 6 hours to get the plane fixed with no options for alternative flights. The pilot gave out erroneous information about the situation during the delay. We were assured once we got to our destination that the rental car agency would be monitoring the flight and someone would be available to assist. Upon arrival no one was at the counter and the security guard said no one was ever available off hours no matter what the airline or rental car agency (Alamo) said. No Allegiant representatives were available or could be reached by phone. I tried Allegiant in an attempt to save a little money but by the time they add a fee for practically everything you end up paying the same price as other major airline for worse service and horribly uncomfortable seats.

### Allegiant Air customer review
While waiting on the plane to land and to head off to Phoenix. It was an hour past the time it was supposed to land, so my wife asked the lady at the desk for an update as nothing was announced over the loud speaker. The lady was rude and unprofessional and answered in a rather rude manner. Then finally about 1.5hrs they announce something is wrong with the plane and it may be 2 hrs or so. So everyone waited patiently for about 2 hrs, then all of a sudden here comes that loud voice again and it said we don't have the part to fix it. There's no need to worry, But of course We are the ones that have been waiting for 3-4 hrs. Then they say a plane will be flying in from Florida to fix the plane in Ohio and it will be 2hrs till the plane arrives before they even attempt to fix the plane I will be riding. Keep in mind it's around the 5 hr mark now. Then they say if you want to give us your luggage we can return it to you, or if you stay we will have pizza! Really pizza? I did not sign up for a slumber party with strangers. Then to make things better the airport (not Allegiant) handed out cots so we're all camped out in the terminal. They didn't even offer any food vouchers or anything to make up for lost time.

You book your flight and when you pick your seat you pay extra. They charge for a carry on and if you haven't prepaid for them it's $50 when you board. A check in line that wrapped around the building, the staff member greeting passengers on boarding looked straight over everyone and never said one word. The cabin was dirty and the seat next to me was ripped. The seats do not recline t back and are upright and very uncomfortable. We ordered a coke, water, M&M's, two cookies and crackers for a total of $12.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I didn't check in luggage and just took a carry on. The flight left a few minutes late due to typical afternoon storms in Florida. We made up the time in the air and arrived on time in Huntington. The flight crew were friendly, seats were comfortable, I picked the emergency row for more leg room, at little to no extra cost than other seats. On the way back, we arrived ahead of schedule. I thought the value was great. You do get nickel and dimed for little things, so bring your own snacks and water.

I booked my daughter on return flight 638 from Sanford to Concord for Saturday evening. We were on our way out of the door to the Airport when we received a text saying the flight was canceled. No explanation, no information about rescheduling. I called the customer service line and waited for 1 hour and 47 minutes before someone picked up the phone. They told me the flight would not be rescheduled and we would have to catch the Wednesday flight 4 days later! Not an option for us, put my daughter and granddaughter in car and made an 1100 mile road trip. I wish I would have read other reviews before making this huge mistake.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My family flew to Fort Lauderdale and back to Concord on separate flights. My first flight left on time but my sister's flight was scheduled to leave at 9am did not leave until 3.45 pm. On return flight my plane was scheduled to take off at 6 pm, we finally got on the plane after 7 pm and didn't take off until 8.30pm. My sister's return flight was scheduled to take off at 1 pm and didn't take off until 3.30. The customer service is the worst I have experienced. I needed to change a reservation (hotel room) and waited over an hour and a half for a someone to pick up the phone. Altogether I was on the phone for 2 hours and 24 minutes to change one hotel room.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My family and I have flown with Allegiant Air at least two or three times a year from Cincinnati to Orlando/Sandford (back and forth) for several years now. Until Friday July 24 2015, our complaints have been minimal and at most had delayed departures because the planes weren't there yet! However, as of Friday July 24 2015, my family and I will no longer be flying Allegiant. We had an early flight out (6.45am), had checked in the night before, and arrived at 6.00am to depart as the airport is so small, it never takes more than 10 minutes to check in and get to gate. We couldn't find any signage indicating where to check bags through for Cincinnati and simply got in a line curbside because I had five days earlier experienced the same thing when dropping my son off to fly same route and had been directed there for checking his bag. We got in a fairly slow, long line and just as we reached the check-in attendant, after having been interrupted several times, she made the announcement baggage check in to Cincinnati, and several other cities was inside! We go back inside the Allegiant terminal, get in another line only to find out as we approached counter, we're told baggage check for Cincinnati was in Terminal A and pointed to a different area (one we never knew existed)! The attendant then tells us the flight just closed and we'd have to find another flight home and the fees would be $75 each person to do so. We explained we'd been there in lines trying to figure out where we were to check in and saw no indication Cincinnati was in Terminal A. To top it all off, the flight we were supposed to be on that closed at 6.10 had a thirty minute delayed departure. Had we known prior to arriving, we were to go to a different check in terminal, I would not be wasting my time sharing my negative review. We will be back to using sky miles again which is most likely less expensive in the long run as discount airlines like this one seem to nickel and dime customers anyway!

Flight from Las Vegas to Boise was scheduled at 4.30, got pushed back 1hr, 1.5hr, 2.5hrs then arrived at the airport where it was delayed an additional 2 hrs due to "Maintenance issues on the flight coming from Fresno" - flight ended up being canceled. Vouchers were given out with a 0$ balance. Next day there were 2 workers checking people in with no sky cap and at least 150 people in line. Flown with them once previously and it was a disaster as well.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We live only minutes from Sanford airport but have never had the opportunity to fly out of there. My son and I were looking for flights to North Carolina and searched Allegiant. We made our reservations to fly up on Friday, July 24th returning the evening of July 25th. I was pleased with our flight up to North Carolina. Nothing major to complain about. We did not have checked baggage as our trip was only one night. Around 2.30 Saturday afternoon I received a text stating that our flight had been cancelled and a website link. The link was for their main website and offered no options as to what to do. I immediately got on the phone to call them and had to wait an hour and 10 minutes on hold before someone could pick up. The lady I spoke to simply told me my flight had been cancelled. I responded by saying that's not a problem just put us on the next flight out this evening. I was told that the next flight out would be Monday afternoon (this is Saturday). I was told I could receive a refund for the flight and given no other options. I asked if the company was going to pay for my rental car, hotel and food expenses for the next 2 days. Of course I received no reply.

### Allegiant Air customer review
They promise cheap fares but you end up paying just as much as any other airline. Their "fees" are asinine. Once you pay the "fare" for their flight, you have to pay extra for each bag, including carry on luggage. If you don't pay online ahead of time for your bags you pay significantly higher prices to pay at the airport. You also must pay extra to choose a seat and extra for "priority boarding" and you are charged $5 if you do not print your boarding pass at home. I am sitting at home waiting for my flight, which has been delayed from 8.50pm departure to 10.15 to 10.45. I attempted to call them to find out if I should reasonably expect to leave today at all. I was on hold for 29 minutes, then hung up on. My second call resulted in a 57 minute hold after which I was told "oh sorry" for the hold and assured numerous times that there would be absolutely no further delays. I received two additional texts after that delaying my flight until midnight and then 1am. I am certain it is only a matter of time before it is cancelled completely. I am livid and have no recourse at this point because I don't want to waste many more hours trying to call them back or sitting in the airport waiting for the inevitable cancellation. Spend the extra money to fly elsewhere.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Staff rude. Delayed plane 3 times before they cancelled. When asking there why all the delays was told it was not my concern and that they would let us know when there would be another flight. Had to sleep at airport with a handicap child. Did not offer a place to stay. Will never fly or recommend.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Allegiant Air has the rudest staff and is always delayed. We were delayed both ways by hours, boarded and de-boarded twice, and then treated badly by customer service representatives when we tried to enquire about expected departure. This situation is normal for this airline and happened the last three times we flown with them. Never again!

### Allegiant Air customer review
I was a nervous wreck for 2 weeks leading up to this trip due to the horrible reviews. This flight was delayed approx 30 min. Boarding was fast and efficient. Crew was friendly, not overly nice, not rude. Flight was uneventful. Would I fly again? I will let you know after the return flight Aug 1st. I had no horrible complaints but no rave reviews either. You get what you pay for.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew out of Fresno on a business trip with work, there was 14 of us in total. I arrived at airport two hours before departure, little did I know that we wouldn't leave for another 7 hours from expected departure. I was supposed to arrive in Vegas at 8pm Wednesday night, arrived in Vegas at 2.30 am Thursday morning. When departing Las Vegas on Friday airline was on time! But it was too good to be true, due to mechanical failures we sat on the tarmac for almost three hours.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My first and probably last trip with this airline. The ground personal in both airports were inefficient and rude. At time of booking I advised of a wheelchair requirement. It was not offered at either airport and non were available. I attempted to check in online without success, so when I got to the airport I was charged $10.00 for a boarding pass. When I advised of my inability to check in online, I was told that was my problem. The return trip was delayed for 1 hour while we sat on the plane. The cabin personnel were very hospitable and helped offset some of the other negatives but not enough to get me to fly Allegiant again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Evening flights had lengthy, unexplained delays both directions. This was a great inconvenience, which employees were unconcerned about. I witnessed one woman charged an additional $100 for large carry-on bag. Minutes later the same employee helped another woman "squeeze" her carry-on bag into the holder and not charge additional fees. Both should have been charged the fee as explained in the reservation process. Seats don't recline at all, uncomfortable. Lower prices equate to lower service.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Couldn't have been better. Ground crew and flight crew were professional. Plane was on time during both flights round trip. Will fly Allegiant again!

I booked to avoid 10 hour drive to Myrtle Beach. Counting the drive to airport, it took 12 hours on Allegiant. Terrible airline and Huntington Airport. Gave them a 1 rating because zero is not an option.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I made the mistake of booking my trip to Sioux Falls on Sunday July 19 with Allegiant. When I got to the gate the flt was posted with 25 min delay. We boarded flt and sat and sat there with no ac working. Now of course this is the middle of July in Las Vegas. After approx 20 min flt attendant advised to take out emergency card from seat pocket and use it as a fan! Flt finally left almost 2 hours late it didnt get cooled off on aircraft until we were halfway to Sioux Falls. I will never fly this airline again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
After our flight was delayed four hours due to our plane breaking down, our flight was cancelled. They gave no vouchers for us even after spending all day at the airport and we were told that they weren't sure when they would be able to fly us out next. Complete waste of time. I will never use Allegiant again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I booked a flight in May to spend a few weeks at our condo in Boynton Beach with my family. We were supposed to leave on July 13 from SYR at around 6.15 pm but after a few hours of waiting, including at least an hour in the plane, we were told that the flight was cancelled due to mechanical problems, After a one hour wait we were finally provided with an hotel voulcher and a new flight itenary for the next day at 5.50. We had to get out of the hotel by 11am, so we ended up shopping in Syracuse and got back to the airport around 3.30 pm to be told that the flight was further delayed 10.35 pm. We finally got out at around 11.30pm and made it to FLL at 2.30 am. Really not a pleasant adventure. I just hope that our return flight on July 27th will be more pleasant.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We booked our trip a few months ago and just recently Allegiant has been in the news for delayed flights, mechanical issues, poor customer service etc. so of course we were worried about our flight. Our flight out of South Bend was very pleasant. Boarding went rather quickly and the staff were very nice. The flight went well and landing was smooth. We arrived in Vegas on time. Our flight home today went the same way and we arrived 20 mins early.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flight was delayed 4 hours due to computer issue. They had to bring in a mechanic from over an hour away to make the repairs. Employee at the snack bar said this happens all the time. There is always some sort of mechanical issue. The stewardess was extremely rude to my sister when she was exiting the bathroom at the end of the flight. For our inconvenience we were offered 1/2 cupful of snack mix and a small cup of a beverage. The return flight was much better with friendlier staff. Not sure if I would fly this airline again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Today and the last 2 times we've flown with Allegiant there have been delays on every flight. We have decided to take our business back to Delta. For the money we pay we should at least be able to rely on flight times, especially when it's a business trip.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Our flight to Honolulu was delayed for 4 hours with and upon entering the plane we sat for another hour and they offered one free ounce of water. One free ounce, after we sat and waited for their plane to be fixed. Family was traveling home from Honolulu and boarded the plane, sat, then had to exit the plane due to engine problems. They sat for an additional 5 hours in the terminal, then told the flight was cancelled and they would have to make their way to the ticket counter to get lodging and transportation vouchers. It was ridiculous. The airline charges for everything. You must pay to book flight online in addition to paying for ticket itself, pay for your seat selection, and pay for food and drink (including water) on the plane.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We were to fly back to Pittsburgh on July 13, 2015 at 5.18 on flight 869. We boarded at about 5.00. When we entered the plane, it was extremely hot with 150 passengers. It was 95 degrees on the plane and there was no air blowing from the overhead vents. We waited on the tarmac to pull away from the gate for an hour in that heat. Flight attendants kept claiming the air would start as soon as we got up in the air and would cool down. Everyone was hot and complaining. Finally, the pilot said there was an error message and we had to get off the plane for maintenance to work on the issue. Maintenance showed up and could not fix it, we could not get another plane that night. After two hours they announced that we could find our own hotel up to $225 and would be reimbursed. The flight was rescheduled for 2.00pm the next day, which was inconvenient as the whole day is gone. We had plans for the next day just like every other passenger. The next day, we check in and I ask how to get reimbursed for food and hotel and the airport representative says she does not know if Allegiant is even reimbursing for food anymore. We show up for our flight and once again we don’t start boarding until 1.40. We notice that it’s the same plane. As we get on the plane, we realize it’s even hotter than the day before and even more uncomfortable. Once again, we take forever to board and we start to pull away from the gate. We are waiting on the tarmac for close to an hour as everyone is miserable and uncomfortable. I am pregnant, there were infants and toddlers that parents had to undress down to their diapers just to try and stay remotely cool. The flight attendants started to bring out complementary waters, but only made it halfway through the passengers, so not everyone even got water including myself. The pilot finally starts to take off and then we pull back into the gate. We are told an emergency plane will be there at 6.30, we will receive a $150 voucher per person, and we will receive food vouchers to eat in the airport. Our food vouchers were $8 each, which hardly covers any meal at the increased prices of food at the airport. We reluctantly decide to wait for the emergency plane. The emergency plane arrives and again we board late.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flight was delayed four times, for a total of 4 hours. Signed up for text alerts for both our flight and the incoming flight we were waiting on. Only received alerts for the first couple of hours. Allegiant even deleted our boarding passes on their app so used ID's at gate to board. Air conditioning did not work for several rows of seats, while my husband's did not turn off and it froze. If a traveller is not on a tight time schedule to arrive at their destination and doesn't mind being inconvenienced by their poorly maintained planes, their flights are very inexpensive. Bottom line - Allegiant passengers get what they pay for.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Our flight was scheduled to leave at 6.20pm. The flight was coming in from Fort Lauderdale and was delayed due to weather in Florida. We received no notice at Hancock international of the delay. When the flight finally arrived at about 6.30 we were told there were some indicator lights flashing that needed to be checked out, but we would be boarding shortly. At about 8.30 we were told they were doing some diagnostics and paperwork and the issues did not affect the safety of the plane and the pilot said we would be going. A bit later we were told that the paperwork was still being done and we would be going provided we got wheels in the air by 11.02pm. They had us board at about 10.15 and I must say A 10-15 minute boarding of a full flight was impressive. We were pushed to the tarmac where we sat for about 30 minutes. Eventually we were told they had to power down and restart to reboot the computer. We finally were deplaned and given a hotel voucher but had to pay for taxi to it ($35). Flight rescheduled for 12pm the following day, we finally took off a bit after 5pm. We were given very infrequent updates, lied to about the issue, lied to that another plane was being flown up. You get what you pay for. Low prices and zero customer service. Never again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Our flight from Knoxville, TN was delayed by more than 6 hours, so the first day of our vacation was lost. The allegiant to go app. failed to work for me. The reason for the delay was because the flight crew had reach their maximum flight hours and had to rest for twelve hours. The flight itself was very loud. They don't tell you that Sanford Airport is a 45 minute drive to Orlando and the cheapest transport there is a minimum of 90 dollars. On the night before our trip back we received the alert to check in and once again the app. would not work. This time I couldn't access their website either. After several attempts that took about 2 hours I was able to check and get screen shots for the boarding passes but could not print them. Finally was able to email screen shots and print from my email. The return flight was on time and landed without incident. Basically, this airline is a good way to get to your destination if you are flexible (don't mind long delays) have a lot of time on your hands to jump through the hoops to get your boarding passes and don't mind the stress of trying to get your luggage fit with in the size and weight guidelines.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flight delayed over 4 hours on way from Cincinnati to Orlando with very little communication given as to why. No gate agents able to answer questions. Return flight has been just as bad. Boarded the flight, sat on the runway for over 30 min only to be told there was a light on and we had to return to the gate to have it looked at. Sat on the plane for 20 min and then told the plane needed further looking into. Now waiting in an airport with zero communication as to when a flight may be available. Horrible service. Will never fly this airline again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My flight to Las Vegas was delayed 4 hours so my first night in Las Vegas was ruined. Now on my way home and they have delayed my flight again! I also paid extra to pick my seat when I initially got my tickets online and they completely disregarded my seat choice so now I have to wait for that to be refunded also.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My first time flying with this airline. Arrived on time (3.30pm) at airport only to find it extremely crowded. Allegiant is the only airline to service Stockton. My flight was scheduled to take off at 5.31pm. The 3.30pm flight was delayed. After checking in we were told our flight was delayed until 8.30pm. The 3.30pm flight finally boarded at about 6.30pm and sat at the terminal for another hour. Our flight finally boarded at about 8.30pm and took off a little after 9.00pm. Once we boarded we found out the aircraft A/C was not working. Our return flight was on time but the A/C was not working on that airplane either. It stayed extremely hot the entire flight. If you have time to waste getting to your destination and like to save money then this airline is for you.

### Allegiant Air customer review
If you need to be somewhere then on time then this is not the airline for you. If you are ok with long delays and no compensation for flights that are cancelled then you could save money flying this airline. The first time we flew Allegiant, everything was fine. The second time, same route, was a disaster. We were scheduled to leave at 7.20 pm and did receive flight delay notifications throughout the day, but my complaint is, the airlines kept us at the airport for hours, promising our flight was "on the way" and we would flight out that night. We even began boarding the flight before they decided the flight crew had "timed-out". We did not leave until the next morning at 11 am and there was no compensation for the delay. We could have driven to Florida in the time we spent waiting for a flight that didn't happen. I can't believe the airlines didn't know the crew had timed out hours before they told us.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Don't fly Allegiant unless you are ok with taking a chance on not getting on a flight the day and time you were planning. They are terrible! They delay flights, cancel flights. My first flight with them should have been an indication of what a nightmare this airline is. I was to get on a 4pm flight and they canceled it less than an hour before it was to leave. I didn't get on a flight until 8pm. They couldn't give a reason for the cancelation. The passengers sat for 1 hour on the plane and then Allegiant decided to cancel that flight because of mechanical problems. They said they had to get a mechanic from Salt Lake City and the flight should be ready to go in 2 hours.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Booked my ticket for $199/RT total, which included airfare, taxes, and 1 checked bag each way. You can't beat that. The check-in process online was fast and simple, as was the check-in process at the airports. All staff that I encountered were very friendly. The overall experience was great and I will be flying with them again. Most of the complaints that I have read are in regards to "hidden" fees. If you read all of the fine print on Allegiant's website, there are no surprises. This is an inexpensive no frills airline. You will pay for everything including carry-ons, beverages (yes, even water), even printing boarding passes at the airport. Also one thing to keep in mind is the checked bag weight limit is 40 lbs, instead of the standard 50 lbs with other airlines. This too is stated on their website. Bottom line, Allegiant is an excellent inexpensive way to get from point A to point B, just remember you're getting what you pay for.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Leaving Las Vegas for a 10.35am trip back home, but without explanation a 4 hour delay. Airline attempt to pacify with a meal voucher. This is very frustrating. Left Brownsville to Las Vegas with a one hour delay. Never again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
They used the same excuse as they did my last flight (LAX to SFG) a week ago that there were "maintenance issues" that caused the delay. That flight was delayed more than 2 hours (the pilot said we couldn't leave at the delayed time because there was still "paperwork" that was being filled out). Now the return flight is delay more than 4 hours. It hasn't even left L.A. Yet to get to SFG, when it was supposed to have been here an hour ago!

### Allegiant Air customer review
I'm writing this review as I sit with my family (8 of us) in the Sanford Orlando airport trying to get to Springfield IL. The 1:37pm flight has been delayed 3 times (3:30,4:45pm and 5:30pm) with no reasons given. This comes after a the 2.5 hour delay we had getting here last week. To add to it the flight from Peoria is also delayed currently. They boarded and the plane was not able to fly - so they got on another plane and it overheated. Read all the emergency landings and delays before you buy a ticket for this airline.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Delayed 3 hours on both ends of trip. If you don't mind sitting around airports for hours this is the airline for you! The waitress we had for dinner at the airport restaurant said she makes most of her money on the delayed allegiant victims. Never again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
The flight was delayed just short of 3 hours, and after boarding the flight attendants were less than kind or understanding of anyone on their flight. After all was said and done and finally in the air, I asked for a little water. The attendent said they would only sell me water and that was the only way I would be able to get any water on the flight. I was suprised and stated that I was under the impression that all airlines provide water to their patrons. She (the attendent) made sure to correct me and say if I wanted water I would have to purchase it. She was very unprofessional and rude. Allegiant as a whole was a very large let down and I shall not fly it again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
This was a 1st and last experience flying with Allegiant Air. Flying out of Ft Wayne beginning with a 2 hour delay and once all boarded and preparing for take off we had to turn around because of a drunk passenger. Passengers had told Allegiant staff before we started boarding about the lady and staff still allowed the drunk passenger to board. Upon returning from our vacation again we encountered another 2 hour delay. Allegiant staff checking our baggage was very rude to several passengers. Customer service lacked in many areas.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Absolutely horrible! They delayed the flights because the pilots didn't have the paperwork correct. So 12 hours later we are sitting at the airport when we are finally allowed to get on then they told us the plane wasn't working correctly. After 16 total hours of waiting we finally took off. The only thing we got was a free one cup of water.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Allegiant Air has become known as the delay airline. Two (2) hour delay leaving St. Petersburg, 45 minute delay leaving Knoxville on my return flight. I have used this airline countless times over the years, and have even recommended it to friends. This was by far my worst experience flying. First they nickel and dime you for everything, including $5.00 to print a boarding pass, if you don’t spend the money to down load their app. The lady at the ticket counter in St. Petersburg was really just rude, the seats are cramped and not really that comfortable.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flown this airline several times from Clearwater to Des Moines and back. Started using Allegiant 5 years ago when we moved to Florida. In the early days, it was on time, convenient, and seemed to have few mechanical problems. Not so any more. Their increasing habit of nickel and diming their passengers to death is just annoying. Tried to add a carry-on bag and the app wouldn't work so they charged me $50 at the airport. Called customer service, waited 1.5 hours and they would not refund the $50. Next trip to DSM = Southwest.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I usually fly Delta or Southwest. Despite the reviews I thought I would give Allegiant Air a try. Left from Tampa/St Petersburg. Arrived 1.5 hr ahead of time (yes, saw the 2 hr suggestion but always get through bag drop in 30 min). It took 45 mins to wait in line to drop bags. Just in adequate staff. We had to upgrade one of the bags we already paid for. Got through security just fine but the gate agent threatened to close the boarding door on my wife as I finished in security 20 mins before the flight left. We ended up being delayed leaving the gate because of a technical problem with the lavatory. The attendants yelled at several passengers because the did not put their phones away. They still use the old rule that all devices have be off during takeoff and landing. Not so good for kids. The fair was cheep but by the time you pay for bags and seats and show up early enough, just not worth it

### Allegiant Air customer review
I used to fly this airline and always said it was a great little airline. No more. My 2.5 hour trip from St. Pete to Rockford, IL took about 10 hours and two separate aircraft. First plane was brought back to the gate from the taxi way with "mechanical issues". After waiting another 5 hours for a second aircraft, the pilot aborted take off. Ground crews at both airports were very rude - that is if you could even find anyone with an Allegiant name tag, lol! As my final destination was Wisconsin, I chose Allegiant to Rockford to save on driving time once I had arrived. Never again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I spontaneously bought bargain tickets on Allegiant, then read numerous negative reviews. After reading those, I was very uneasy about flying Allegiant to Florida, especially with two young children. Our non-stop round trip from Columbus to Fort Lauderdale was one of the easiest experiences that I've had with an airline. The price was half of the competition, all flights were on schedule, the planes were clean, and staff were courteous. The plane's seats were not plush, but were more than adequate in size. We will be flying with Allegiant again!

July 22, 2015 Allegiant Air's Flight 548 (LAS-BIL) was delayed 5hrs. Aircraft finally at departure gate A12 and passengers were informed by Gate Agents that boarding would commence as soon as replacement Flight Crew arrived. Passengers stood in boarding line for 1/2 hour when Gate Agents redirected passengers to gate A14, where there was no aircracft. Same gate Agent announced to passengers at gate A10, in line to go to Eugene OR. that their new gate of departure would be A12. Allegiant Air gave the aircraft away and cancelled ultimately cancelled Fight 548. Allegiant Air gave no reasons for cancellation and did not provide commodations or alternate air travel for that date. Fare refunded for that segment.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Plane was delayed because of a mechanical problem, fixed it, took off and had to return to Vegas because of overheating on the engines. We were told there was another plane flying in from Stockton to replace this one at 5pm. Plane from Stockton did not come, we were given $8.00 food voucher, by that time only place open was Burger King. We were told we would be put up in hotels for the night. Our group's hotel was never confirmed in the end we had to find our own hotel and transportation, there was no communication at all, we were just left. We finally got to our hotel around 11pm that night. Next day we were suppose to be on a special flight at 5:10pm and home by 7:45pm. They boarded us late then we had to get back off the plane because there was a fuel leak. We finally took off at 6:30pm - not recommended!

### Allegiant Air customer review
My flight was scheduled to depart at 7.30 am. Now it's 2.15 pm and we're still waiting for the plane, they changed planes because the original had mechanical problems that they didn't realize until after we boarded. The funny thing about all of this is that I took the same flight last fall and was delayed 6 hours because they diverted our flight to a charter. They only reason why I booked a trip with them again is because they gave me travel vouchers. It was not worth it. If you read this, don't book a flight with them or if you do, expect a high probability of delays.

### Allegiant Air customer review
The boarding was delayed by 40 min followed by sitting in the aircraft for almost 2 hours. I booked this flight as I wanted to reach NY early for the July long weekend but by the time the floght started, it was already the time I should have landed. Please don't book by being fooled into the cheaper fares, it is not worth it.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I hear all sorts of complaints with Allegiant Air online and my personal experiences with this airline have all be very positive. Besides getting the best fare, I only end up paying for what I want. All employees I've had contact with have been pleasant, helpful and courteous. No, you don't get a free bag, a free carry-on, a free soda or any other complimentary items. If you want them you pay for it. I'd always been a fan of Southwest, due to their renegade ways in bringing down the cost of flights, but Allegiant has beaten them at their own game. While I'd be willing to put up with some issue for the sort of savings I get from this carrier, but as of this date, I have no complaints with Allegiant Air.

### Allegiant Air customer review
They have great prices , but once you book, you'll find a charge for selecting any seat on the airplane, having any type of baggage with you, and printing your boarding pass at the airport. If you want to actually take advantage of that 75 dollar flight, you must travel in a swim suit with your mobile boarding pass on your smart phone. Why did I continue to fly this airline? Because for a while, it was the only airline that I can find that went to my destination. But it began with 2 hour delays on the flight (they seem to only fly one plane in one route all day so if the first plane is behind, the entire day is lost). Don't expect anyone to be at the counter if you arrived 2 hours before your flight is supposed to leave. You must show up 2 hours before your flight is scheduled to leave because one of their favorite pastimes is making you wait on them. Once you actually board the plane (4 hours later) it's not so bad. The flight attendants are pretty nice.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Customer "service" is the worst. Despite purchasing Allegiant's flight insurance, one must call the airline to make any changes. Wait to speak with a human is routinely over one hour. This low budget airline needs to spend just a few dollars to provide even a minimal level of service. Some ground service personnel are clueless and unprofessional.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We fly Allegiant often. Typically no problems. No frills, which is fine by me. The only issue with Allegiant is with calling customer service. The last time I was on hold for 45 minutes and gave up. Today, I have been on hold for an hour and 15 minutes and counting. I know they want everything self-service on the web. Sometimes getting help from a rep is required - today is one of those days.

### Allegiant Air customer review
The attendants at both airports and on the airplanes were nice and helpful. Very smooth flights on time both ways but we had an issue when my husband booked the flights and had to wait on the phone for around 3 hours before being able to talk to someone to resolve our issue. This is ridiculous. There were 3 of us and because of no customer service on the phone we will probably not fly with Allegiant again - too bad everything else was good.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Stranded 2 families in Sanford. Had to rent cars to get to Clearwater and fly to Harrisburg and rent cars to ABE. Cost of car rentals inflated because a whole flight was cancelled. These were not cheap tickets at $400 per person.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We were delayed four hours on our flight out of Northwest Arkansas for mechanical issues. On our return flight, we were told we would be delayed for 30 minutes because our flight attendants hadn't made it from California. About an hour later, we were told there was going to be another delay due to the cabin temperature being 100 degrees. They were needing to try to cool it down. It was so hot when we finally boarded, and it was about 35 minutes on the tarmac. We then are excited to finally land at XNA, and they tell us they are very sorry another plane is at the unloading bridge. It will be a few more minutes. Ten minutes later, they tell us there is another plane in front of us, and it will be another hour sitting on the plane as it quickly starts heating up again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Today is 6/28/15. My flight was to leave at 1:30pm. At 12:50 I got a courtesy notification that my flight is delayed and would now leave at 6pm. It also said flight time is not certain. Now I can't reach their call center. And it may take more than 1 hour to get an agent to pick your call. So I booked my entire round trip from another reliable brand to fly out today. It sure is a very costly lesson to learn.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Three hour delay from Pittsburgh. 1.5 hour delay returning home. Staff were not very friendly. The low fare is a farce as there are so many add on charges for things that we paid more for our flight then friends who flew JetBlue during the same period and arrived on time both ways with free carry on, free drinks and snacks and TV.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flight cancelled due to mechanical issues. Passengers waited on plane an hour, then deboarded and were not told anything about the flight for another hour when told it was cancelled. Told something would show up in email. At the time no alternative flight. Later that night after alternative plans and an email appeared that told of a replacement flight the next afternoon. Most had made alternative arrangements since Allegiant did not usually fly on Saturday from Indianapolis. Told to call customer service for refund. Hold time greater than two hours. Took a full day of multiple attempts to get through. Very poor effort at informing consumers, very poor customer service. Will not fly again, saving $30 is not worth 2 days of hassle.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Departure and arrival times seem optional and unreliable. I fly frequently, but this was my first my last Allegiant flight. I literally spent more time, both going and returning waiting out the delays than I did actually flying. This airline is perversely committed to making the passengers rue the day they opted to fly Allegiant.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Our flight had been delayed 4 hours due to mechanical problems, the staff was wonderful - helpful and friendly. The airline supplied pizza and soda or water. Everyone on the plane seemed relaxed and understood the staff were all working hard and doing their best.

Good news for anyone who wants to gamble. You don't have to go to Las Vegas to gamble. Just buy a ticket on Allegiant Air. They may or may not get you to the destination. And they may or may not do it in a timely manner. And just like Vegas, if you lose your bet, Allegiant does not want to hear any complaints. Was scheduled to fly from Knoxville to Fort Lauderdale for a weekend. 24 hours before my flight was to depart, I got notification that it was delayed. Then 2 hours after the original departure time, it was delayed until the next day. I spent hours on hold trying to speak with customer service. I sent emails to their contact us email. The website says they will get back to you within 24 to 48 hours. My weekend has come and gone, still no contact. There is absolutely no expense wasted on customer service. There is absolutely no regard the customer.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Low base fare, but be prepared to pay for a 3% credit card surcharge, $34 for your choice of individual seats among a limited range, $5 for a single boarding pass, $35 for each checked bag, $50 for each bag being over-weight (no inspection seal on scales). After 5 hour flight to Hawaii, we had to wait 35 minutes on the runway because of mismanagement concerning available gates to unload. We missed our connecting flight. Caution, schedule at least 2 hours for transfers in Honolulu. The airport is a joke. Good reliable aircraft, but you cannot get a cup of water for less than $2, on a credit card. Snack food only, so bring a peanut butter sandwich. Seats do not recline.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I arrived at the airport 2 hrs early to find out the flight was cancelled with only a 2 hr notice. They put us up for the night in an awful motel. While at the motel other people that missed the flight informed me that some people took the later flight, and there was a flight going out at 10am. So I went back to the motel and waited 2 hrs to talk with someone about the 10am flight instead of the 8pm. Many other people had to go to other airports that night to keep from missing cruises, etc. The flight on the way back was 2 hrs late to top it off. So, the price was good if you have time to burn, but I will not be using this airline again, since it cost me more money to miss the seminar, not to mention the aggravation!

### Allegiant Air customer review
Allegiant Air is a discount airline and as such all extras will cost extra to keep the ticket price low. So if you can travel with just a small back pack sized carry on you won't pay for bags but otherwise any larger size bag is going to cost extra. Drinks and snacks on the plane will cost extra, but you can bring your own snacks for free of course if you think ahead. Seats are not as comfortable as a United or larger carrier, they don't recline and they aren't as cushy. But the upside is that my flight was a direct flight and the price was super low. I think it was $65 one way or something ridiculous like that, not even on sale. Staff were friendly, and I had no issues whatsoever.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I will never fly Allegiant again. They don't have a customer service desk and will never refund your ticket. They delayed our flight over 5 hours and the most they gave us was a $50 voucher for another Allegiant flight and $8 meal voucher which is hardly enough for a meal at an airport. Don't be fooled by their cheap tickets, they will charge you for everything else!

### Allegiant Air customer review
My husband flew out of Indianapolis, delayed 4 hours on June 1st. Coming home today (June 13th) from Punta Gorda, the exact same thing. Because of plane issues. Absolutely ridiculous.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We fly from KY to FL frequently on Allegiant because the fares are low. However, be prepared for virtually 100% of your flights to depart and arrive late, sometimes an hour or more. Also, if you have to change your itinerary, forget it. Just throw away your ticket since you can not make any changes, even for a fee online. We have waited on hold for hours trying to connect on the phone to a customer service agent only to be disconnected when their automated system tried to connect us to a representative. This happened multiple times. So if a Greyhound bus with wings with no service in the air on on the ground works for you, then Allegiant is your airline. Checking in with luggage is a hour long ordeal as well. The prices w/o extras or luggage are compelling and the experience then is bearable.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Allegiant Air is definitely cheap. My husband's plane was delayed on his way to LAX and again on his way home. On his way home, it was because they had no co-pilot. As I write this review, we are still not sure that he will make it home today or how he will make it home at all. He may need to buy a ticket on another airline.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My husband and I frequently fly from Chattanooga to Florida. We have always viewed the value as very high for what you pay. We would pay at least double for a Delta flight to the same locations. We have only had one flight ever delayed and it was only for an hour. Considering that on any other airline, we would have a layover of at least this long, it has never deterred us. We always choose to pay for our seats close to the front and have never had an issue with the checked bag fees. As long as the item you bring with you will fit in under the seat in front of you, you can consider this item a personal item instead of a carry on. We have always managed to have our backpacks with us without any additional fees by putting them under the seat in front of us instead of in the overhead bins. For half price flights to Florida, the value is great! We have never had a real complaint and are planning on taking another flight with them this fall.

### Allegiant Air customer review
First trip was on May 2, 2015 from Punta Gorda to Pittsburgh. My wife and I paid for seat assignments that were not necessary as the plane was half full. Contrary to a lot of reviews, our experience was fine. The Allegiant representative in Punta Gorda was very friendly and set the pace for the rest of the trip. We have booked two more trips to Punta Gorda and hope we don't have the bad experiences that others have had.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew with Allegiant to Maui. We left Bellingham 4 hours late so I missed my connection. Cost me a night in a hotel two taxi rides and the cost of another flight to Kona on the Big Island. I have never sat in a seat so cramped. I am only 6'2 but my knees were nearly above the seat in front of me. Luckily no one sat beside me and I was able to swing off to the side. Yes the flight was very cheap. It was not worth it. Alaska would have been nearly $200 cheaper with all the other costs I endured. Have not flown with them again nor would I recommend them.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flight 811 5/28/15 AVL to TPA. Cheapest and worst airline in the skies. So you truly get what you pay for. Planes are seldom on time and when late are very late as in 2-5 hours late. When planes are late staff seldom (close to never) provide a timely or truthful explanation for the delay. No question that Allegiant is cheap. Cheap all around.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Initially I was very impressed with the seat quality and aircraft. The flight attendants on my flight from Colorado Springs to Las Vegas Friday May 22nd were however extremely and unnecessarily rude. They instructed everyone to turn off their phones and I complied but left my noise-canceling earphones in because research shows decibel range while on an aircraft has been proved to cause hearing damage. She came over to me and said extremely rudely "Are you coming to Las Vegas with us? I replied "yes? She said "Then you need to turn off your phone right now! I showed her that it had already been turned off. Even more rudely and insultingly she said "Take out your earbuds now! I stated "they are noise-canceling and that's why I have them in. She said "I don't care you need to take them out. I was amazed at her lack of tact and insulting way of speaking to clients. I will gladly pay an extra two hundred dollars to fly on an airline where customer service is valued. It starts the vacation off with a terrible taste in your mouth.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew from Las Vegas to Cincinnati on May 14. Flight took off and landed on time. All employees were friendly professional and helpful. The flight was comfortable. I paid extra to choose my seat and check my bag and both were worth it. Even with the extra charges it cost more that $200 less than Delta. I will definitely fly Allegiant in the future.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flight 755 from New Orleans (MSY) to Indianapolis (IND) on May 8. For fear of delayed flights we only took Allegiant home from New Orleans to Indy because a delayed flight would negatively affect us less in that case. I'm sure in part we were just lucky with our plane customer service and such - our plane was fabulous. The seats were very comfortable. There was so much leg room. Our flight was on time to leave and land. The employees were a little disengaged but not rude. It wasn't an issue or a benefit. The only hiccup was the flight attendant who told us immediately that some seats including ours were getting some dripping and mist from some sort of condensation overhead. She moved us up 12 rows to avoid it. We were lucky that the plane was only 40-50% full so we had three seats to share between the two of us. Per sitting together I'm sure the less-than-full flight helped but we checked in right at the 24 hours prior mark which I hoped would better ensure us sitting together. I have no doubt anyone on the flight could've switched seats to be together in they wanted - perhaps flight attendants are kinder to do that than in-airport staff who don't want to make things hard on the inner staff? Tips: 1) Read all FAQ and prices. 2) Check in as early as possible. 3) Go in expecting potential delays and such. Will continue to use them.

### Allegiant Air customer review
5/3/15 flight 603. 5/9/15 flight 602. I have flown Allegiant a few times and they continue to amaze me with how poorly they run this airline. Customer service representatives seem to almost enjoy making your life more difficult. Every plane that I have flown has been extremely filthy as they try to save costs by not using a cleaning service. On the topic of costs they charge you for everything. Printing boarding passes at the airport choosing a seat inflight refreshments and even your carry-on luggage all cost extra. The weight limit on checked luggage is 40 lbs vs the standard 50 lbs the rest of the industry uses. When you add up all the costs it is no cheaper to fly this "budget" airline than it is to fly with a more reputable company. Buyer beware!

### Allegiant Air customer review
Overall our experience flying Allegiant was pleasant and as expected (flew from PIA to PIE). They are very particular and charge for every "extra" along the way but to be able to take my family on a direct flight from our local airport at such a low cost is worth any perceived hassle. Flight out was delayed by about 30 minutes return flight arrived early. We were traveling as a party of 6 (including 1 lap child) and were able to get seats together on both flights even though we had not paid for assigned seats in advance. Not sure if this was because the flight was not full or if we just lucked out. I had to check in at the airport with our infant so got a paper ticket there but needed to check in the rest of the group using their app to avoid the $5 ticket fee. The app had assigned seats all together when we checked in. Unfortunately on the way back we were running late to the airport and they close the online check-ins 60 minutes before departure so we were forced to pay the $5 fee for the additional tickets (the agent gave us all seats together without us even asking). We choose to take two checked bags and each had a personal item. I was surprised by the very small dimensions for the personal items they didn't seem to be monitoring closely the size of these at our airports but I wasn't wanting to be caught with a surprise carry-on fee so we made sure our luggage fit within the size limitations. We did get caught on the way back with one overweight bag but they gave us an opportunity to move things into our personal items to avoid the extra weight fee. Total cost for 5 round-trip airfare tickets with 2 checked bags was

We flew round-trip Grand Rapids to Orlando. Never again. We knew prior to booking that we would need to pack light because of the baggage policy. We packed together (my husband and I) and checked one bag. We downloaded the app to our phones so we didn't have to pay for the boarding passes. We checked in and paid for luggage before hand to avoid any extra fee for that too. What we didn't expect was to purposely have our seats separated since we did not 'purchase' seats beforehand. You would think that when a husband and wife book 2 plane tickets together at the same time that they would put these two seats together. Big parties sure I can understand why they couldn't all be seated together but two people? Come on. Leaving Grand Rapids the man at the counter rolled his eyes and muttered the seats numbers and letters and that was it. Changed our seats to be together since there was room on the plane which is only fair. The lady at the Orlando ticket counter was a completely different story. She was rude and disrespectful. She insisted that there was no reason we should have to sit together if we didn't have children with us laughed when I told her she was being rude and refused to change our seats even though there was room on the plane to do so. She kept saying this was the policy and no seats were to be given for free. We paid for 2 seats on a plane we didn't want any specific seats we just merely wanted to sit together since we were going on a kid-less vacation and wanted to enjoy our time together. If there are 2 seats together that are open why couldn't we move to them without being charged? The nickel and diming for the baggage fine I get it. Purposely putting 2 passengers separate because you want more money out of them even when there is vacant seats? Distasteful. The flight attendants were less than helpful didn't look too thrilled to be working here either. The ride back to Grand Rapids left a terrible taste in my mouth and now Allegiant has lost me as a customer.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Allegiant airline was exactly what I thought it would be - a cheap direct flight no frills but efficiently and effectively got me from point A to point B. I was very worried having read all the reviews but most people only come to sights like this when they have negative things to say but I can't say anything extremely negative - sure the seats didn't recline and weren't very comfortable and I wasn't given free snacks/drinks but I knew this going in. Will definitely fly Allegiant again! Great value.

### Allegiant Air customer review
April 2015 - South Bend Indiana to Punta Gorda FL. The extra charges are absolutely ridiculous - we pay for our seats for our carry-ons to take it inside the plane extra 100$ if we want a carry-on to be checked we pay extra charges if we pay with credit card we pay even for a printed boarding pass. All these services are free on major airlines. And then the flights are very frequently very late. Our flight was 5 hours late. Awful service the worst airline. They advertise the lowest prices but all the extra charges added up to a final ticket more expensive than Delta and it's not worth it anymore. Also be aware that if you reserve rental cars through Allegiant when you pick-up the car you will pay all the taxes that have not been added to your ticket and these are substantial. I will not fly Allegiant again and I wouldn't recommend it.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Allegiant Air forced my wife to pay twice for her bag or wouldn't let her on the flight. Returning from Vegas to Vancouver April 27th and had prepaid for carry-on bags. As we were boarding the gate agent said her standard size bag was too big it is the exact dimensions allowed on their website. She has used the same bag twice before and never an issue we also measured with a tape just to confirm before we left. The agent demanded US$50 additional for the check bag fee after already having paid US$25 for carry-on and then once she got her card charged let her take the bag on as carry-on and put it in the overhead bin same place it was on all other flights. We watched dozens of passengers with the same size or larger bag board without a word one had a stuffed duffle bag over 3' long double the allowable length not a word. We will never fly them again. Once you factor in all of the additional fees this discount airline is a total rip-off. Do yourself a favour and fly with a reputable airline not Allegiant Air.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Syracuse to Fort Lauderdale 4/17/15. Fort Lauderdale to Syracuse 4/20/15. Both flights delayed about 40 minutes but was probably due to congestion on runway in fort Lauderdale which delayed arrival in Syracuse. Bought seats 3 months earlier because it was getting old having to drive to Buffalo to get a direct flight. Read their instructions carefully so we knew to check one large piece of luggage and 2 personal items to stow under seat. Paid for two seats in aisle's 10 (flight to Ft Lauderdale) two seats in aisle 11 on return flight. Also paid a little extra for my window seat. All add on fees are stated clearly when you book the flight. Since we booked 3 months in advance and it was not a special holiday weekend we got a good price. With travel insurance the total cost for 2 round trip tickets was $540. The planes may be older but the one we flew was recently refurbished. It is spartan and if the flight was longer my back and bad hip would have paid the price. The leg room is fine (I'm 5'6) and the seats are large enough. They could use a bit more cushioning so maybe next time I bring a cushion. The seats do not recline which is a negative unless the person in front of you would have caused a problem if he or she wanted to. The staff was friendly but you can only buy beverages (no coffee) or calorie galore little snacks (purchase by credit card only) for a modest cost. Bring on board your own food and the problem is solved. They deliver what they advertise. A modest cost direct flight. You won't get stuck with a connecting flight or have to drive to a city with a direct flight. There are no surprises if you read the material. Is a free carry on item cheaper when the total cost is higher. Obviously my opinion would be altered if the delays are endemic and since the planes are old I can imagine the frustration of sitting at an airport for hours awaiting a replacement to arrive. Other interesting titbits. They load the plane from front to back and they keep the boarding pass at the gate (so remember your seat assignment). I was pleased overall. If I want more comfort a different airline might be in order. After all Buffalo is a nice city to visit and fly in and out of (if the thruway is open).

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flight staff were standoffish. Flight 990 PGD-IND and flight 991 IND-PGD. The air was blowing in around the oxygen panel to the point that we had to be moved mid flight to another seat. Even though we were delayed 2 hours the sign at either airport never read anything but on time. The driver on the other end had no idea we were going to be two hours late. Had to board the plane from the stairs at the back of the plane! The plane was so cold coming home you could have kept meat frozen. The Air nozzle was broken and couldn't be turned off. Plane was full nothing could be done. I finally shoved a piece of paper in it to deflect the cold air. The captain spoke so fast that he couldn't be understood. Will I fly with them again - no.

### Allegiant Air customer review
After reading some reviews I was a little sceptical seeing how this was my first time using Allegiant Air. The plane departed from Knoxville TN on time and landed in Orlando on time. I looked up bag information online before the flight and there were no surprises as some reviews had mentioned. There were snacks on the plane for sale and the staff was courteous and helpful. The seats on the plane were comfortable as an economy airplane seat can be expected. This is the perfect airline for anyone traveling light or just looking for the best price. Will definitely plan to use Allegiant again in the future.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Leaving Cedar Rapids Iowa going to Las Vegas. Plane issues forced a change of planes and a two hour delay. Airline changed the gate number at the last minute. As we pushed back from the gate I got a text message that the flight was delayed 1 hour. Why did they bother boarding us if there was a problem? We are told that because temp was 90 degrees it was too hot for this type of plane to take off. This is a common condition in Las Vegas. Why on earth does this company even have this type of plane here if it isn't suitable? We were then told that we must remain on the plane 20 minutes. If the plane can't take off why were we still on it? We are then told we were waiting for paperwork. Another "plane delayed text". After 2 hours and 10 minutes we were unloaded while a different plane was prepared. We were boarded onto an identical aircraft then we were told that the plane could indeed take off. After 7.5 hours we were finally in Iowa.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I set out to fly on Allegiant Air because I thought it would be a good deal and time saving since my family lived in Northern Maine and I live in Florida. First off I'd like to say that when you add up everything extra you have to pay for on this flight you really aren't saving that much. The plane I flew on was old and uncomfortable none of the seats would recline at all and the seat I paid extra for didn't have extra legroom compared to other airlines normal seating so I can't imagine how little room you got on the rest of the plane. During the flight you have to pay even for water. On my way back my flight was delayed 3 hours which is not enough alone to really upset me but when asked what was going to happen if they couldn't find a replacement plane they informed us that we would have to wait till tomorrow and absolutely refused to try and put us on other airline's flights nor did they even say they were sorry. As far as I'm concerned paying a little more is worth it to know that I'll fly on an airline that will get me to where I need to go!

### Allegiant Air customer review
We are frequent flyers in the US as well as Europe. Last time we travelled with Allegiant was horrible. The staff was rude we needed water and they didn't offer us any they seated us separately even though we booked our tickets months before and they had many empty seats to seat us together but they refused to. They also try to charge everyone for even 1 extra pound of luggage weight and they make you actually take a shoe off your suitcase and place it in your hand luggage to make the weight exact. They also tried to charge us for our carry on a normal size carry on that we take on every airline and never had any issue. Staff on the ground and on the plane were so rude. We will never fly with them again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I've been flying Allegiant for years now between Ft. Lauderdale and Knoxville TN. No delays in the last year so I'm pleased (lucky!). The trip last week was my first on the different plane and I just hate the new seats. Hard and too straight my back was so achy I couldn't wait to arrive. I don't suffer back pains so I know the seats were the culprit. It's bad enough that they're so narrow but now they're like a board. It's not a long flight but must they make the ride so unpleasant? Don't they know how to make seats a little more comfortable?

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew from Honolulu Hawaii to Las Vegas last night on flight 1050 with 13 family members. Flight was delayed 5 hours due to maintenance. I understand things happen beyond the airlines control. After sitting in the airport for 5 hours we board and find out no complimentary anything - not even water. Again totally fine. But when I am paying full price for food and drinks and the flight attendant assisting is beyond disrespectful to not only me but other people on the flight making comments like "didn't the snack cart just come around? to a guy who was in the bathroom and missed it. Was extremely disappointed in the customer service I thought they were just rude to me. When someone is paying for over priced food and drinks after sitting in the airport not knowing if we are even going to be able to fly today. At least show some customer service.

Round trip flight to Clearwater FL. Both flights delayed over 3 hours. There was no apology no offer of a free beverage. At the flight end we were asked to align our seat belts and pick up other peoples trash. With all their up charges and fees our trip would have quicker and less expensive with a major airline with 1 stop. Not worth the hassle.

The flight from Grand Rapids to St. Pete's was our first and our last with Allegiant. On our way down to Florida our flight was delayed 3 hours with no explanation other than "mechanical issues". When we arrived at our gate there were two cases of (warm) pop and one case of (warm) water. When we asked the gate agent when the incoming plane would be arriving he told us 30 minutes. Much to everybody's surprise there was a plane at the gate 5 minutes later. Upon boarding the plane our flight attendants showed their true colors and lack of professionalism of Allegiant Airline. They made light of the life preserver located under the seat in the event that "the flight turns into a cruise". That is not only an extremely unprofessional comment but it certainly did not sit well with an already anxious flyer. For our returning trip we arrived two hours ahead of our scheduled departure as instructed. When we attempted to check our bag we were kicked out of line along with everyone else on our flight because Allegiant could not "handle" us at that time. We waited another half hour before being allowed to re-enter the line to check our single bag. We hoped that was the worst we would have to deal with that day but sadly we were wrong. After boarding the aircraft we proceeded to sit on it for an hour and a half with no idea what was going on. Finally we were told that we would have answers within the next 5 minutes as to what the situation was and we didn't. We deboarded the plane and sat in the airport for an additional 2 hours. When I asked the gate agent what was going on I was told they didn't know and there was nobody that I could speak with to find out. I will never fly Allegiant again. Although they may appear to offer customers a deal the headache they inflict is not worth it. I strongly urge anyone considering to fly with them to reconsider.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We flew from Toledo OH to St Pete/Clearwater this past week. At both airports we were treated courteously and efficiently. We downloaded the Allegiant app and so downloaded our boarding passes for free and with no waste of paper. Perfect. Our flight was short so it didn't matter to us that the seats did not recline. In fact space was tight and reclining seats would have likely caused some conflict. The seats were comfortable but again I wasn't travelling far. We packed our own snacks (cheaper and much healthier) and brought our own drinks on board. No inflight entertainment but a small inconvenience given our cheap our flights were. Love that Allegiant flies into smaller airports as it makes the whole process easier. Very pleased overall and would book with them again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My wife and I arrived two hours early to check in. Just before boarding time we were informed the flight was late. The flight was delayed three hours in good weather. After boarding and waiting to take off we accelerated down the run way and came to a screeching halt. The plane was not fit to fly and we were returned to the terminal. At this point it was mass confusion people were standing in lines with no instruction or guidance. We finally managed to get our luggage back but unable to contact Allegiant about anything else.

### Allegiant Air customer review
There is a reason they only offer flights that no one else does. They have more hidden fees than any airline I have ever used by about triple. You pay outrageous bag fees fees to choose a seat fees for in-flight snacks fees for boarding passes fees for a carry on. Make sure you don't take full size luggage or anything but clothing or you will be over the weight limit. Overall flying with Allegiant was the worst flight experience of my life. No inflight entertainment or even the option to purchase it.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We just flew out of Niagara Falls. We are Canadian and saved a lot of money by driving the extra hour or so our only snag was an ice storm we had to drive through. Long story short we sat in the airport all night waiting for our flight to arrive from Sandford after they couldn't land because of poor weather conditions we were all shipped to a local hotel where we stayed at no charge. The next morning we were all given an $8 food voucher and a $100 credit. The airport was small the people were friendly especially the flight attendants to and from Sandford! I will definitely be flying with Allegiant Air again!

### Allegiant Air customer review
On March 5th we traveled to Las Vegas. Assigned separate seats even though we bought tickets together - not good. Accept credit card only to purchase items onboard - not good. On the way back from Las Vegas to McAllen we encountered weather problems and had to land in Laredo. We land in Laredo and were told we had to stay in Laredo overnight due to bad weather. Allegiant did not provide nor offered any assistance. If we wanted to drive back to McAllen it would be at our own expense.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We have flown with Allegiant before and found it not too bad. We recently flew to Sanford FL February 28 to March 10 and I have to say I will think long and hard before flying with them again. I can understand charging for seat changes if they put you at the back and you want to be at the front - but when you book as a couple and want to fly as a couple (husband and wife - same last names) and they don't even sit you together - I have issues. They put you all over the plane so you have to pay the extra fee to sit together. There was a vacant seat beside my husband on the flight. Also you have to pay for boarding passes now. I have to say the flights are not filled like they use to be and I can see why.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My sister-in-law flew back to Plattsburgh from Punta Gorda on Allegiant after a week-long visit. The first thing she said when she called after arriving in Plattsburgh was that the airplane was filthy. There were crumbs on her seat and the bathroom smelt awful and was dirty. A totally terrible experience especially after paying over $400 for her ticket and an additional $20 for a carryon that she was told was too big for the overhead. Never a problem on other airlines. They also had the nerve to charge her $5.00 for printing her boarding pass at the airport.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I booked a flight to Ft Lauderdale to visit family from Feb 23 to March. I only booked the flight due to lower costs and non stop flight. Sadly the service was not good. It took almost 2 hours to leave Syracuse airport. This was not due to any weather issues. Not sure what the reason was? Service on the flight was terrible and individuals were young and unprofessional. Return flight we waited at Ft Lauderdale for over 2 hours to have the flight cancelled due to inexperienced pilots wrong scheduling? What? They were rude and the pilots that were scheduled were rude as well. They were joking and laughing about incident. The gate employees told us to go to the ticket counter for a hotel voucher. However no rental food or shuttle vouchers! The refund for the cancel was $100 per ticket. We waited in line for an hour before anyone showed up.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Boarded the plane and were deplaned due to mechanical issues in Phoenix/Mesa. Over 4 hours to fly in a replacement plane from Vegas an hour or less flight. Purchased trip insurance for flexibility tried to call their Vegas customer service number 4 times left on hold for anywhere from 45 minutes to over an hour each time I tried never did get through. Yes they will try to nickle and dime you on everything and no more free parking at Gateway hub. Last time using Allegiant.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I could go on and on about late flights and horrible experiences with Allegiant Air. I have flown approx 6 times with them in the last 12 months and 10 out of 12 segments have been late. I understand a few mins but I'm usually talking 30 mins to 2 hrs. I'm sitting in Punta Gorda as I type this at 2.44 pm for a 3.05 departure the board says we are "on time" ( but it always does) however there isn't a plane anywhere in sight on the tarmac. All us passengers are sitting around telling stories of our past experiences with this 3rd world airline and we keep wondering why we do it. There comes a point when the $100-$200 savings isn't worth the savings when u waste an entire in sitting in an airport. Never Allegiant Air Southwest I'm coming back to you on my next trip in 4 weeks.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Mar 1 2015 Niagara Falls to Punta Gorda. Text received after arrival at airport (ie 1 hr in advance) that there was a 2 hr flight delay then a further delay and by 10.30 pm they cancelled the flight. No food offered (some pop but you had to go looking for it the certainly did not tell you). Did put us up in the Super 8 for the night. Flight rescheduled for 1.30 the next day got off the ground around 4.00. We had also prepaid for a car for the original time booked but lost a full day. Return flight March 5th also received notification of 3 hr delay after checking in at airport this flight was ultimately 4.5 hrs delayed - no reason given no food or beverages offered. I do not mind discount I understand prepaying for luggage etc (although not even free water onboard is inhumane) and am a frequent flyer but the service or lack thereof with this airline is beyond deplorable.

### Allegiant Air customer review
It is worth booking with Allegiant only if you book early for the best possible deal and do your homework. I did not do the former but was glad I did the latter (which if you're reading this you are also doing.) Pack light or the charges add up. Bring food and fill a beverage container after security or the charges add up. Print your boarding pass before heading to the airport yup more charges. Finally keep your expectations in check. This airline is a means from A to B not a 'travel experience' on which to build memories. There's no in-flight entertainment or free food. Best for relatively short trips that do not require frequent washroom use. Oh and contrary to many reviews here I found the crew to be attentive good-natured and even humorous.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Our first time trying Allegiant and our last. The aircraft itself had to be older than me - and I'm 37. Then there were issues with the gate agents "miscounting" the number of individuals on the plane. They made several passes through the cabin and came up with a different number each time. Next comes the maintenance issues and delays. We were initially delayed because of maintenance issues on the aircraft. Something to do with the de- icing system and another to do with the fuel calculations? Which made no sense. We were initially delayed for an hour that turned to 1.5 hrs after we need to wait on updated flight documents to make its way back to the plane. The flight itself -- I've never been more tense on a flight than this one. I could go on about the nickel and diming - baggage fees (and then more of an up charge if you do it at the airport) baggage weight limits below industry standard fee to print a boarding pass charges for any drink or snack on the plane etc. I'm surprised we didn't need to swipe our credit card to use the restroom on the plane! We were traveling with 8 people in total not one of those 8 people will travel with this airline again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
To say that this is an economy airline does not really label the airline properly. This is amateur hour. I am sure that they have some terrific flight attendants. I sadly did not get to meet any of them. Be warned none of the seats in the plane recline. Like many airlines now they charge for bags. Unlike any airlines that I know they limit the weight to 40 lbs. not 50 lbs. If a bag is 41 lbs. they charge for a full extra bag (if you have a 41 lbs. bag it costs $100). They charge for water. Our flight was delayed because they had not calculated the fuel requirement correctly and had to send 4 flight attendants and 2 ground crew up and down the aisle again and again counting the passengers. Unlike any other airline I have used one is required to turn all electronic devices off. Airplane mode is not acceptable. Unlike any other airline that I have used no one is allowed to use any form of electronic device during take off and landings. While that was common place 10 years ago that has been proven to be unnecessary on every other airline. The planes are old and well worn. I had never used Allegiant before this past weekend and will never use them again. I did not save that much money to make it worth while. Extremely disappointed.

Flew from Allentown PA to St. Petersburg Int Airport Fla. on 1/31/2015 returned from St. Petersburg Fla to Allentown PA on 2/27/2015. Both flights going and returning were two hours late not a good thing! My wife and I were totally surprised how we were charged for everything from boarding passes to seats luggage food and beverage on the flights. The extra costs made flying with Allegiant not so cheap!

### Allegiant Air customer review
I have flown Allegiant for 5 years lately they have cheapened everything up cut out flights from the airport they used to serve charging for everything they can think of and in the last 6 months 3 out of 4 of my flights have been delayed several times one was 4 1/2 hours without so much as an I'm sorry! I will be using someone else from here on.

Indianapolis to New Orleans 2-12 flight #755 2-19 flight 754. I fly a lot. This is truly the worst airline I have flown with. The only plus is that it was not stop. Both flights were delayed. Minuscule personal items one per person. There is a fee for a carry on and the small dimensions must include the wheels handle zipper luggage tag and anything else protruding from it!

### Allegiant Air customer review
Feb 20 2015 from Punta Gorda Fl. to South Bend IN. I have emphysema and spinal stenosis and need a wheelchair to get through security and to the plane. I can walk certain distances but not as far as through airports and to planes. My friends drove me to the airport but had to get a wheelchair for me because they had no one to do it for me. Then they did not have anyone to push me through security and to the gate so my friend had to get a pass to push me through all that. At the gate an older man with a cane came over beside me and there were some wheelchairs sitting there so he got one to sit in and asked me if I knew why there was no help for us. Usually handicapped people are boarded first along with people with children and first class passengers. This did not happen with Allegiant Air. They boarded a long line of what seemed to be a lot of first class passengers and I don't know who else before the actually asked the older gentlemen if we needed help to the plane. They finally pushed us to the plane. My assigned seat was in the second row so I don't know where the so-called first class people were sitting. The biggest insult came after landing in South Bend IN. They announced that people waiting for wheelchairs were to remain on the plane until all other passengers were gone. I was surprised to see several wheelchairs sitting just outside the plane door but no people to push them. Finally someone came and pushed me into the airport. Another point against Allegiant Air is when I tried to print my boarding pass it wouldn't let me. This is usually because I have to carry a POC (oxygen concentrator) to use on board. I printed the page telling me this because they charge $5.00 if your boarding pass has to be printed at the airport. Foolishly I thought since I showed them I couldn't print my boarding pass they wouldn't charge me $5.00 but they did without telling me. It just showed up on my credit card. The two women at the ticket counter were unfriendly and at times downright rude. The attitude was this is the way it is so take it or leave it. It is not an airline I will ever fly again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Planes going and leaving were delayed because of issues with their planes. The fleet is very old had no inflight entertainment offered nothing to guest without requiring money and the experience left an overall bad taste in your mouth. If you fly with them download and register boarding passes and luggage early or you'll pay dearly for it. I won't fly with them again. Welcome to Indianapolis.

### Allegiant Air customer review
February 20/15. Just returned home from a RT flight and package from Niagara to Fort Myers. I had read a lot of reviews regarding this airlines. It made me nervous. But our experience was great. If you do your homework before hand you won't be surprised with a lot of extras and confusion. I would definitely fly this airline again. They were slightly late returning home (20 min). This was it unusual for any other airlines we have flown. The luggage arrived on the carousel quickly and without incident. The check in at Niagara was quick and easy. The same couldn't be said about Punta Gourda. We were there in plenty of time but soon became fearful of missing our flight. We didn't but it was close. Both check-in and security were backed up severely. The staff on the plane were great. There was a medical emergency on the plane and they handled it well and kept their cool. All in all the whole experience was every bit as good as any Air Canada flight I've been on. Only complaint would be that they charge for water. Took my own on the returning flight!

### Allegiant Air customer review
We flew Cedar Rapids IA. to Mesa AZ. Flight was only 15 min. late. Seating very cramped and uncomfortable. No problems with personnel.. We had to change reservations. Went online and were given a number to call. Waited 45 min. to get to talk to anyone. No problem once we got through. We had to cancel our return trip. Again waited 45 minutes to talk to anyone. We cancelled two months before scheduled flight and was told we could only receive a voucher for another flight. The voucher was good for 12 months but they dated it from Aug. 2014 . The flight was for April 2015. This made the voucher useless to us. All in all the lower fare was not worth the hassle.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We flew from Youngstown Ohio to Punta Gorda Florida and back a week later. While the flight down was delayed about 1.5 hours they did text me to inform me of the delay. I was very pleased that on the return flight I was able to gate check a guitar I bought in Florida. They loaded it last from the jetway and it arrived unharmed. Musicians often struggle with instruments so I applaud Alligiant for making it easy for me. Plus both flights were smooth and uneventful. Will complain that the seats do not have the pocket that most airline seats have to store stuff and Allegiant charges for everything they possibly can. Most airlines charge for seats bags etc but Allegiant takes it to a high art. I will fly them again for the convenience.

### Allegiant Air customer review
This airline has an affordable price. But it needs improvements in some areas. Pros: good price non-stop extras are not built into the price you have a choice what you want to pay for (seats beverages food priority check- in baggage options). Cons: I purchased "trip flex". Could not change my flight online. Needed to call a rep. Waited 1/2 hr for a rep and took approx 1/2 hr. to get one leg of my trip changed. Very slow. When I got to the airport nowhere was flight info. posted. I had printed off my boarding pass and did not want to stand in line to find out what gate to go to. Had to ask a baggage person who was unsure and he found another employee and finally got my answer. Got to where I was hoping my gate was to find no agent. Other people were sitting around in confusion as well "hoping" they were at the right gate. Still no flight info on the screen. Had checked my flight status before leaving which posted "on time" and after asking other passengers (still no agent) found out that the flight was delayed 2.5 hrs. You do have a text option for alerts which I signed up for but did not receive.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Wont ever fly them again! Cheap is cheap you get nothing comfortable or convenient. All I can say good is we got from point A to point B. They charged us 50$ for a bag that was 46 pounds (most airlines that's within the 50# allotted). They are rude. No snacks nor pop are free even after delayed twice. Seats have no room and plane is cramped badly. Very uncomfortable flight. We sat waiting to even pull away from where we board for 40 minutes before getting out to taxi down runway. I would pay the little extra and fly a better airline any day!

### Allegiant Air customer review
Besides the nickel and dime the others mention: for flight from Rockford IL to Orlando. Got there 2 hrs early as instructed. At departure time 6.43pm our plane was still on the ground in Orlando (no reason why was given). We waited for the plane to fly here. Almost like 2 uncomfortable flights for one! Got to car rental at 2am Orlando time - our car was given away. Coming home the flight was on time and 3 minutes shaved off of flight time 2.5 hours. After landing picture the plane noses right up to the wall of the terminal we deplane go to baggage area in front of plane on other side of that wall. They took over one hour to move the bags through the opening to us about 150 ft. total. Temps were 20's but no snow. Never again. Their contempt for passengers is too high. It took almost one hour before they said bags will be delayed!

### Allegiant Air customer review
We had a wonderful experience despite being worried about the bad reviews. 2 adults and 4 children and probably would not have taken this trip were it not for the "unbundling" Allegiant does that allowed us to fly people to Florida at only $130 each RT! We definitely "unbundled by printing boarding passes at home and then at the hotel (savings: $60) and by packing light (4 carry-ons and 6 personal items (backpacks between us. We also flew with children over the age of 11 and chose not to board early (savings) and not to guarantee seats together. Another big savings even though Allegiant did book us all together on one flight and 3 and 3 on the way to Florida so it was not as if we were scattered all over the plane. We brought our own snacks on board (savings!) and we were able to go directly to the gate. The gate agents did not quibble about the size of the kids backpacks which were technically a bit over the size restrictions but we were processed right through happily. The stuffed toys they won in the theme parks their blankets and their food/snacks were allowed on with no problems. Our flight to Florida was right on time and the service was very friendly. We were even allowed to move seats to find window seats for the kids!! On the return we flew just a day after a massive snowstorm in the NE with multiple cancellations and yet our flight had only a 1 hour and 15 minute delay. During the delay I was astonished to see Allegiant set up a "drink station" with cups ice an ice scooper and free water and several kinds of sodas in the waiting area at Sanford/Orlando. Considering this was a weather related and very short delay we were amazed by that gesture. Yes you might be "nickle and dimed" but only if you feel you must purchase the 'extras' like leg room or extra bags or snacks or if you need someone to print out your boarding pass for you. If you want to have that service great! But for those of us who don't need that service and would rather spend our money at the theme parks on our children - Allegiant is a wonderful option. The flight attendants and gate agents were friendly and the customer service on the phone was top-notch. We will be flying this airline again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Very pleasant experience. Would definitely fly with them again. I went out of Concord NC to St. Petersburg FL. I traveled with my cat. Unfortunately my cat screamed the entire flight (something that was I was not expecting). However the flight attendants were very understanding. The seats were comfortable. There was plenty of room under the seat for my pet carrier. I did not order any drinks. However the drink selections looked more than adequate and the prices were comparable to other airlines. This was a short flight (1 hour).

### Allegiant Air customer review
We travelled to Phoenix on January 19th and returned on the 26th. We are very upset by all the extra charges. They offer cheaper rates but then add on $75 for one piece of luggage $25 for a carry-on $18 to select a seat plus all the taxes. Why don't they just make it a one fee and include everything? The airline does not offer free (or any) coffee tea or even just a glass of water. You must purchase everything else you want to drink. Where is their customer service?

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flying with Allegiant used to be a great experience but not anymore. I recently went to Las Vegas from Des Moines Iowa and the plane had a problem and we had to spend 2 hours in the uncomfortable seats before takeoff. Nobody bothered to offer us water or anything. After 4 hours of being in the plane we got to the destinations. We didn't have too much luck on the way back to Des Moines I was charged 50$ for a 8 pound carry on because their site will not work properly so I couldn't add it online for 18$ fee. They're ridiculously charging for choosing the seat boarding pass carry on and water and soon for the oxygen that we're going to breathe on the plane. I'm really upset because it's such a disappointment to travel with them these days. I hope they will get better.

Flew from Minot to Phoenix and back on the weekend. The price was right and there were no surprises with luggage costs we read everything online before we left.

I would definitely fly with Allegiant again!

### Allegiant Air customer review
When I first started flying from PHX to BIL on Allegiant about four years ago I was thrilled large plane direct flight great prices. Even though I had to drive 2 hours to get to Phoenix from Tucson it was worth it. I told everyone about this great little airline. Well that great little airline seems to be suffering from growing pains. In other words they've gotten too big for their britches. They're charging prices like the big carriers (in spite of the fact that fuel prices are half of what they were a year ago) but not offering the same service. They nickel-and-dime you to death: $5 to print your boarding pass for you? $50 for an overweight bag (down to 40 lbs. allowable - it used to be 50 lbs.). Having to purchase water? Paying for seat assignment and checked and carry-on bags? What's next pay toilets on the plane? The worst part is trying to call their "customer service" number. I needed to change my reservation but wasn't allowed to do so using their website. While I waited on hold for 35 minutes to find out what the additional fare would be I had to listen to a recording continually telling me that I should be using their website instead. On the up side both my flights were actually on time for a change. Allegiant seems to want to charge large carrier prices without providing large carrier service (which isn't exactly anything to rave about either). If they want to sit at the grown-ups table they better learn to put their napkin in their lap instead of tucking it under their chin. Speaking of napkins I wonder when they'll start charging for those too?

### Allegiant Air customer review
Never again. Flight from Greenville to Orlando delayed due to mechanical issues on plane coming in from Orlando. After boarding aircraft waited on tarmac for 45 minutes. Back to gate. Stated we could get off and sit in jetway but could not go into terminal. Waited for an on call mechanic another 1.5 hr wait. Plane fixed. Off to Orlando 4 hours late. The return trip no email that flight was late. Get to airport 2 hours early. We have a plane and no crew. Waited for crew to be called in to work. They arrive and now no pilots. Told we will have a pilot from incoming flight that is now 3 hours late. Crew very rude when boarding. Return flight also 4 hours late. You get what you pay for folks.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew 1/22/15 from AVL to PIE on time no issues. Last 10 flights have been on time. Remember several things: 1) Check in online at least 1 hour in advance or it costs you $5 per adult2) luggage weight limit is 40lbs or they charge you 3) every flight we have flown has been packed. This is a no frill airline that's adds costs for everything. They fly into small airports not the big ones. Know and follow the rules or it will cost you $.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I have flown Allegiant Air 8 times in the last 12 months usually with my wife other times with friends and children (a total of over 30 flights). Overall we have had excellent experiences with minimal delays (usually caused by snow storms) and once even arriving early! This airline is very good value for what they charge! I will continue to regularly fly with Allegiant in 2015.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Nickle and dimed! We were trying to fly from PA to FL on the cheap so we went with Allegiant. Big mistake. The base fare may seem inexpensive but they charge extra for everything (carry-on +$30 pick your seat another +$30 drinks snacks $5 etc.). The flight attendants were cranky and rude! My husband is tall and he has a bad knee so we paid $32 extra to reserve his seat in the emergency exit row (more legroom). I was led to believe that I would be seated next to him if possible. Not so. I checked-in on-line exactly 24 hours before the flight and was seated on the opposite end of the plane. Just before take-off we noticed that the seat next to him was empty. I politely asked the flight attendant if I could sit next to my husband and she rudely barked that I could not sit there as it was an exit row and I hadn't paid an extra $30 to sit there. I quietly returned to my assigned seat. If you're thinking of flying with this airline just be sure to calculate what you're actually spending (after baggage fees picking seat fees printing boarding passes fees getting a drink of water mid-flight fees etc.) and be sure to factor in dismal customer service as well.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Got evicted from my seat for being "too attached to my grandchildren". My husband and I took our family - 9 adults 4 children 2 infants-to Hawaii. We paid extra for the better seats for all of us and also for two exit row seats for my husband and myself. We were very pleased with the seats and the legroom for the price we paid. However While waiting an hour on the tarmac for the plane to take off I and many of the other passengers used that time to get up and stretch our legs. I talked to my family and helped entertain the grandkids. Upon returning to my seat the flight attendant told me that I had lost my chance to be in the exit row because I was "too attached to my grandchildren". I was incredulous but she was very firm. I had to switch seats with my son for the entire flight to Hawaii. So beware - if you are in the exit row - don't act like you like children.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I fly a lot and when I heard Allegiant was coming to Indianapolis I was very excited. That changed quickly. Be prepared for the following fees on top of the airfare: Between $15-$30 to choose your seat. That's each way not round trip. If you are flying with a family there is an extra $100 easy. $15 each way for a carry on bag. You can only bring a lap top bag for free. $15 to use a credit card when checking out. $50 for a checked bag. Online booking fee. $5 to print boarding pass if you do at the airport. All in all it was about $60 cheaper than Southwest for me to get to Tampa from IND. If they just rolled all those fees into the total price I would be happy. But they make you first decline a hotel rental car attractions trip protection. Then you have to go page by page with the fees. By the time I got hit with a $15 credit card fee I was exhausted. Also no place to put your Known Traveler Number. Be ready to wait on hold for over 30min for that. I'm afraid if I do it at the airport they will charge me another $10!

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew out of Grand Island Nebraska January 8 2014. I understand there are policies for the size and weight of carryon luggage (which mine met). Observing the interaction of the agent with the customers checking in I found her to be rude unprofessional and lecturing. She didn't bother to listen to customers or attempt to help customers. At least she was consistent in her poor behavior toward all customers therefore I conclude this is either a training or management issue.

### Allegiant Air customer review
The flight crew would not give me a cup of water to drink on a flight from Honolulu to Los Angeles. All food and beverages even water was for additional purchase. The seats were extremely uncomfortable and my lower back hurt me a great deal. It was the worst flight I have ever endured. It took almost 30 minutes for baggage to arrive to the carrousel and the arrival gate was very far from our connecting flight which we almost missed! I would never fly with this airline again.

I went from Provo to LA. I was stuck at the airport with 3 kids for 13 hours while Allegiant kept delaying our flight. Finally after flying home and being unable to land we flew to Las Vegas. It took another hour and 3 lines later to get a room. I could have drove home and to Disneyland twice in the time it took to fly with them. Actually I would have drove home if they would have been honest at first rather than keep delaying. My husband and I both missed a day of work.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My husband and I traveled from Rockford IL to Las Vegas December 11-14 2014. The flight December 11 was first delayed due to a maintenance issue. After arriving to the airport we found out the flight was totally cancelled. We were told that our flight was rescheduled for noon on Friday the 12th. We finally departed at 12:35 December 12th. This caused us to miss nearly an entire day of our short trip. On the way back Sunday December 14th our flight was again delayed due to a maintenance issue. We were asked to switch gates and wait for another plane to arrive. We finally headed home 3 hours after our scheduled flight. We have made this trip 4 times in the last 8 years and only 2 of those trips were acceptable. The last time we had a significant issue (once again missing our first night in Vegas due to maintenance issues in the plane we were flying in and having to make an urgent landing in Colorado to wait for another plane) Allegient was willing to offer a travel voucher to us. We will never be using Allegiant airlines again.

I have flown from South Bend Indiana to and from Punta Gorda Florida several times on Allegiant each time I ask myself why? Well after today no more. They had 4 flights scheduled from Punta Gorda this morning but only 3 ticket agents on hand. As a result we waited in line for 1.5 hours to get on the plane only to be told by the boarding stewardess to hurry as they wanted to leave on time and that we should have got there earlier. Flight crew was crabby and bossy service in general poor. Back to Southwest for me!

My wife and I flew from Hagerstown to Sanford/Orlando round trip. The trip was very enjoyable. I will fly Alligiant Air again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
LEX to PIE. PIE to CVG. First time with Allegiant and last. Seats are plastic with minimal padding I don't mind the non-reclining but 2-3 hours on a plastic kitchen chair is uncomfortable at best realistically it was painful. Five flights leaving PIE on the 3rd of Jan all delayed at least an hour. Five flights of people in a four gate terminal. There weren't enough seats the snack bar ran out of food and TSA was a joke. Check-in was a circus with the clerks culling certain flights to check in first. Not because of time they just chose to do it. Sorry Allegiant you're not an economy airline just a bad one.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew GRR to Sanford/Orlando Jan 3. Flight was over 3 hours late. Of the last 3 flights on this route all three were over 3 hours late. Very poor! I think they may need new management. Airline used to be quite good and on time. Other passengers gave us the same story on their flights in recent years. Next time we'll go Southwest from MCO.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I've flown on this airline for 2 round-trips from Belleville Illinois to Sanford FL. One of the flights was on time. The other flights were not. 1 hour late on 2 flights and 8 hours on last flight. They gave me a voucher to redeem through there reservation number for 8 hour late flight $75 voucher not even a full airfare. Also gave me a food voucher for $6 that just barely buys a hamburger in Sanford airport. Tried reservation number 4 times 45 minutes each time no actual human being ever answers. Just automated and music. I also chatted with agent online terrible just terrible no help at all. Terrible customer service. I will not fly this airline again. Do yourself a favor and use Southwest almost as cheap when you add up all of Allegiant's fees. Terrible airline!

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flight from LAX to Idaho Falls. Arrived at LAX 1 hour early and the Allegiant flight is not even listed on the airport monitors. There is no one behind the Allegiant counter. Pilots and crew show up and still no plane. Not even the pilots know what is going on. Finally some Allegiant airport staff show up and inform the waiting passengers that a plane is being flown in from Las Vegas. 1 hour after our original departure time the plane arrives. Passengers get first text from Allegiant that the flight has been delayed. No kidding? Another hour passes and we're told of another hour delay because "The kitchen needs stocking". Then another delay to "refuel". This goes on and on. The poor pilots and crew are stuck between horrible management and grumpy passengers.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I use Allegiant because they fly to some smaller airports at very competitive rates (Sanford Roanoke). On Christmas eve last week I boarded the 1st plane for an hour before a maintenance issue came up and we deboarded. 2 hours later we board a second plane which flew for about an hour before returning to Sanford. This is probably because Allegiant flies the oldest fleet in the country. We were told another plane would be there by midnight (13.5 hours in Sanford airport). So I missed Christmas with my family. But they did give us $8 for food all day which doesn't cover the cost of the cheapest burger available and a $100 voucher which I had to call twice to use. I guess this is what comes with being the lowest cost ticket.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My flight was from tri-cities airport to St. Petersburg/Clearwater on Friday January 2nd. My husband and I received a call 1 day before our flight telling us that our flight had been moved from 10am Friday morning to 11.59pm Friday night. This means we will be in town another full day and both will be missing work. Not only that but our flight was delayed 3 and a half additional hours. So now we will not be taking off until at least 3.15am. This would put my husband and I getting home around 6am. No voucher or compensation was offered. The man at the Allegiant counter said he has worked in an airport for 37 years and had never seen anything like this. Allegiant Air should be ashamed of themselves and their lack of planning.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My flight from MOT to LAS (447) scheduled for 1/2/15 for 6.20pm. After 3 delays we got word that our plane had finally arrived. Instead of pulling into the airport terminal it went to the Fedex hanger. Of coarse they had to have the crew go pull them out by the time they offloaded the crew had reached it's "time" for the day but if they hadn't been delayed 3 times and then parked at a Fedex building instead of the terminal then they wouldn't have run out of "time". So 5 hours waiting at the airport were a waste and instead of just cancelling the flight right away we were not honestly communicated with. We were informed that night that the flight would be 9.30 am. After arriving to the airport I get a call and email saying the flight had been rescheduled for 1.15. So after I return again to the airport the flight is delayed but this time no warning or communication. Just time to board comes and goes. An update came at 2.30 that they were having troubles with the plane and that they would have it fixed momentarily and be on there way. At 4 they told us they were all clear that once the flight crew gave the go ahead then we would begin boarding. At 6.30pm they told us the plane wasn't going to be able to fly. They then told us that in 2 hours a new plane would be coming from Fargo to pick us up. So it is now 7.39 and I have been here in the terminal with no food or drink waiting for some honesty and communication from Allegiant. I can deal with being caged I have a pc tablet cell phone and book. The worst part is the elderly and small children.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I've flown Allegiant many times and always from Bellingham to Palm Springs Palm Springs-Bellingham. The only reason we take Allegiant is because we live near Bellingham and Palm Springs and they have direct flights. The seats don't recline and couldn't be much closer and they charge extra for everything. But today on the flight from KBLI to KPSP was really miserable the plane left an hour late but worse because the floor and my feet were freezing the entire time we sat on the tarmac and during the entire 2.5 hour flight. I would definitely bring winter gear next time I fly Allegiant in the winter. I have never experienced such a cold aircraft floor on any flight in over 30 years of flying on a dozen different airlines.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew to LAS from BLI in Sep and this will be my last trip with Allegiant. Booked a package "deal" through their website like we have more than a dozen times before. Sure there were incidents in the past but because we thought we were getting a "deal" on everything we let it pass. Found out when we were at the airport that another major airline now also offers service to Las Vegas that when compared to Allegiant for price and service wins hands down. When we went back to Vegas in Oct I decided to book my hotel car and shuttle separately and then booked our flight with this other airline. Then just to compare I booked the same package deal through Allegiant to compare prices and this is how it turned out. Flight with other airline +$64 booked hotel through hotel website -$120 booked car through car website -$28 booked shuttle upon arrival in Vegas -$4 in total I saved $88 on a package deal where I thought it was the best deal. $88 plus the unsatisfactory service and on time arrival and depatarture record is huge to me.

### Allegiant Air customer review
If you carefully read the website while booking your flights and know and understand exactly what extra fees might apply to you then it's an incredible value. This is truly a "no frills" airline. Old generally uncomfortable airplanes but efficient and cordial staff and competent pilots flying out of small airports. I flew Niagara/Buffalo to Sanford and both flights arrived relatively on time (one flight was 15 minutes late due to a handicapped passenger trying to get to and into their seat which is nobody's fault). I paid for my carry on beforehand and while their carry-on sizing is on the small side I was eventually able to fit mine into the sizing holster and be on my way. It was an easy 1hr 20 minute drive to Niagara/Buffalo airport from the east side of Toronto. Parking at Niagara airport is almost like mall parking. Find your spot and you'll be at most a 3 minute walk from your car to the departure desk. I'd downloaded my ticket to my phone so no fee for that and was at the gate with plenty of time to spare. The other benefit was rental car pickup at Sanford is literally a one minute walk out the front door of the terminal. No shuttle/bus to get to rental cars like Orlando Int'l Airport and others. I paid $220 round trip including my carry on baggage fee. The same flight with Air Canada Rouge out of Toronto would have been $600 and for sure would have been a far inferior experience both at the airport and from a service perspective. To put it into perspective a 25 minute taxi ride to get from Toronto to my house is $80 each way. So for $60 more I flew to Florida. Again if you go in knowing that this is total no frills no free entertainment no free food/drinks and you just want to get from A to B in as inexpensive and efficient a manner as possible then I'd have no hesitations recommending Allegiant to anyone. It's rare these days to be pleasantly surprised by an airline experience. Kudos to Allegiant and associated small-time airports.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Booked a RT for my family for a Christmas vacation from Tulsa to Sanford and this was our first trip on Allegiant. Departed right on time on a MD-80 with a refurbished and comfortable interior. As a frequent traveler who rarely reclines a seat in other planes in consideration of the passenger behind me I was relieved that these seats were not reclined seats so the passenger in front would not infringe on my space. Flight crew was friendly and professional. Return trip was 2 hrs late departing but I got a text message 7 hrs in advance and I adjusted our schedule accordingly and all was well. Return flight was on an A320 in great shape and the crew was friendly and professional. We liked the approach of paying for only the extras you want and the web site was very clear about this so we don't understand why anyone is surprised and can't comprehend the pricing model. Allegiant Air is a good product fairly priced and we will certainly be repeat customers.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I flew from Hagerstown to Sanford and back five days apart. I found everyone in both terminals to be very cordial. The boarding agent in Hagerstown was actually humorous and made the wait seem shorter. The flight attendants were not exactly warm but they were nevertheless efficient. Both flights left and arrived on time. I have read complaints about luggage fees but I think the website is quite clear so I decided to travel light. I had a small bag as my one small free carry-on item and I thought that I might have to pay a fee for the dozen roses in my other hand but there was no extra charge. No problems on my first flight using Allegiant. I'll do it again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Our trip was from Ft. Wayne IN to Tampa Fl. Allegiant made us believe that we would be flying into the Tampa International Airport we actually flew into the Clearwater/St. Pete Airport. We made arrangements to rent a car at the airport but because the car was not at the airport we landed we had to pay ($35) for transportation to the Tampa International Airport to get to the car. On the return home we had to return the car to Tampa International Airport and pay ($40) for transportation to get to the Clearwater/St Pete Airport to our flight home. The people at the car rental office says this happens all the time because of Allegiant Air's miscommunication! We got a great deal on our airline tickets but we had to spend so much extra on the car that we'll certainly think twice before using Allegiant Air again!

### Allegiant Air customer review
Booked several weeks in advance for a trip from Minot ND to Las Vegas. We paid for advanced seat selection and a checked luggage item at the time of booking. The Allegiant website and online check-in app were incredibly easy and intuitive. I did have difficulty getting the boarding pass to load with the app at first but a couple of tries later it worked. The check in agent in Minot wore a Frontier Airlines uniform and generally was kind of ignorant. The Minot terminal was very cold. The flight was delayed briefly for an issue with an inbound passenger but eventually left about 20 minutes late. Flight was uneventful and went by quickly. I found the MD-83 to be actually quite comfortable even though the seats didn't recline. There was no inflight entertainment system but the onboard magazine was decent and even contained Vegas coupons! We arrived only a little late. The crew was efficient and friendly and even cracked a couple jokes over the PA on arrival and bags dispensed quickly. On the return flight check-in and boarding were pleasant and quick and we left on time. The airplane however was absolutely filthy! The seats were worn the tray tables were slopped all over and even the window had food on it. We had the same crew situation as outbound in that they were efficient friendly and helpful. On arrival to Minot we were early but luggage took 30 minutes to dispense. In the end yes this airline is acceptable. They're certainly inexpensive and the crews are on par with most other carriers. If you want to save up to a few hundred dollars I'm sure you can put up with buying your soda onboard.

Flew from Bellingham to Las Vegas on November 17th 2014. My first and last Allegiant trip. 6 hour delay in Bellingham arriving in Vegas after midnight and losing our first evening on a short break. They gave us a $8 meal voucher which bought half a burger at the only restaurant in Bellingham air side. What looked like a cheap fare was not so good after adding $30 to select a seat $26 to take a carry on bag and another $26 for a carrier usage fee. When the plane did finally take off it was freezing cold they charge for everything on board and didn't even have hot drinks available. Consumer loyalty needs to be earned from delivering service above and beyond customers expectations.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Punta Gorda from Columbus Ohio. They charge for a carry on. You are allowed to carry on one personal item for no cost so just a purse if you are a woman. Then you pay for your checked bag. If you can't or don't pay ahead of time for your bag it's $50 at the airport! I tried to add a bag after I checked in and I couldn't unless I paid the $50 at the airport. $5 if you don't print your boarding pass yourself and all drinks and food are extra on the plane. When I boarded the plane it was very old. The seats had no padding and they don't recline. Customer service is a joke and by the time you pay all the little fees you can fly Southwest cheaper. I will never fly with Allegiant again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flight 105 on Nov 10th from Peoria to Phoenix/Mesa. I was recently on a flight from Peoria IL. to Mesa AZ. The fasten seat belt sign was on for over two hours even though the flight was mostly smooth and little turbulence. An elderly gentleman got up to use the restroom and was told to return to his seat. The flight attendant was very rude with a control complex. I have never been on a flight where people were not allowed to get up and use the restroom.

### Allegiant Air customer review
This airline is based on everything being a la carte. You pay for your ticket your seats (yes even seats) your drinks and your baggage and yet the whole experience turned out to be better than many other airlines. For one this airline made it possible for me to take my whole family along because of the low rates. Secondly the staff was super nice. There is only one class in their aircraft's and everyone gets the same service. Bucket leather seats are pretty comfortable even though they don't recline. There is no inflight entertainment but then again with all the carry-on gadgets today who needs another console in your face? I am giving inflight entertainment five stars because I actually enjoyed not having another console blasting ads in my face.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I've flown Allegiant Air 10 times in the last 2 years. I normally fly out of Sanford Fl to Bangor Harrisburg or Youngstown. The problem I and my wife have is each time we fly into or out of Youngstown. They are very unorganized and always cause a problem. On Sunday Nov 9 2014 I was told that my carry on bag was too large and I had to pay an additional $50.00. I had already paid $12.00 for the carry on. They said that is not their problem. They also charged me $5.00 to print a boarding pass. I only have problems in Youngstown.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I flew to CVG and back to Punta Gorda and have no complaints I received excellent service. The flights took and landed on time. I had my dog with me on the return flight and there were no issues there either. The plane was clean crew was nice - how could I complain about a reasonably priced direct flight? I suppose if you need frills and pampering maybe this is not your cup of tea but for easy going people who want to get where they are going for an excellent price check them out.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew Nov 7 2014. Tried to check in online and print ticket but it would not allow me to do so. Got to airport to check-in and had to pay $5.00 for my printed ticket. I also paid $30.00 to have my seat selection that I wanted. Allegiant Air did not show up instead Falcon Air was flying us from Pasco WA to Mesa AZ. Was told that they were not going to allow anyone to use prepaid selected seats. Just open seating. Not happy when we arrived I went to Allegiant counter to ask for a refund. They were extremely rude and said not their problem and suggested that I talk to corporate. I asked for a phone number then was told they don't have phone numbers to give out. Flight home was the exact same as flight down. Where is Allegiant Air and why are they booking flights and charging for seats that they don't offer.

### Allegiant Air customer review
10/25/14 flight 581 from Bellingham to Las Vegas and on 10/26/14 flight 580 from Las Vegas to Bellingham. The trip down on flight 581 was severely delayed. Taxied down the runway only to have to come back to the gate when a warning light on the navigation system came on just before take off. At the gate 20+ minutes later they thought they had it all sorted out and were wrapping up paperwork went to push back from the gate and the light came on again. Thankfully after a few more minutes they let us off the plane and kept us in the terminal. Flight eventually was given permission to travel without the navigation systems but had to redirect flight path and had to fly at a lower altitude to avoid traffic. This crew was friendly and polite and the pilot kept us informed of all the things that were happening. The major downfall our flight landed almost 4 hours later than scheduled and the only compensation we received was a free $2.00 beverage. Flight 580 the next day was better in some ways worse in others. Again taxied down the runway and were next to take off when a warning light came on. We sat on the runway for about 30 minutes waiting for the issue to be fixed. Sadly the crew was very rude both in person and on the intercom barking orders and coming dangerously close to a yelling tone with passengers. This was not my first poor trip with Allegiant but it will be the last. The low ticket price is no longer a selling feature since they gouge you on fees for everything including printing a simple boarding pass. Driving to SeaTac Airport is about the same cost when you add in all Allegiant's fees but comes with the added peace of mind when it comes to mechanical soundness and pleasant staff.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Provo UT to LAX on Oct 16 2014 flight 130 and 131. After I booked my flight I started to have second thoughts. Many people complained that the seats do not recline they sit back better than some of the popular airlines and do not need to recline. I think all airlines should have seats like this. Why should passengers in front of you be allowed to stick their seat in your space! The leg room was far better than most other airlines. Both my wife and all those that came with us were very happy with the seats. Could they have done a better job putting us all together - yes. If you have a lot of luggage you might be better off with a different airline. For the price I was very happy.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We have a limited access to a variety of airlines as we live in a rural area and have relied on Allegiant the majority of time as their airport is closest. We will now be not using them as we ran into a delay again when coming back from Vegas. Felt bad for the counter personal as no one could check in due to technology problems - large group of people standing in line for over an hour. Finally got on plane and took off at 7.45am. No coffee blankets or pillows on plane. We sat in the front row and got to listen to the staff talk about their personal issues the whole flight. Very unprofessional and my thought was what an easy job sitting down with an occasional walk thru giving orders to tired customers otherwise just sitting! We know it's a low cost airline but common courtesy doesn't cost anything. The delay was the second time it had happened using this airline and they will not be given a chance to do it a third time! Will not recommend this airline.

### Allegiant Air customer review
10/12 CKB-SFB flight 670. 10/19 SFB-CKB flight 669. I recommend Allegiant Air. Fly non-stop no frills low cost comfortable on time no hassle. At small airports spend less than 20 min from landing to your car and 60 min from arrival to departure is enough. Newly refurbished MD80-great plane. I am 5ft 10 and had at least 4-5 inch free space in front of my knees. Charging $26 for carry-on is good so people pay $40 for 40 lb / 81 in checked bag and the overhead bins are empty to put the allowed personal item. Room under the seat in front of you is big. Seats do not recline-big deal! Allegiant is low cost with egalitarian all-coach plane. No marketing or pressure for you to but food or stuff like on Ryanair. You want priority boarding $10 and its yours.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flight scheduled to leave CVG at 12:46 pm on 10/10/14. Flight bumped to 1:30pm then 4:30 pm and then 6:30 pm. Upon boarding there was an odour of fuel in the back of the cabin. We were all ordered to get off the plane. After a half hour we were told to go home and the flight would take off 2.45 pm the next day. We were told that we were going to get $150 vouchers for future flights. We were not thrilled with having to deal with this airline again but we had no alternative except to miss our vacation all together. The next day since we had no other alternative on flights we reluctantly came back. This flight went well although they still felt compelled to charge for a soda as if no one on the flight had spent 10 hours at the airport the day before. Keep in mind that we used Allegiant's site to rent a car for 8 days - now we were down to 7 days. When we arrived at our destination the Alamo car rental rep told us that we would have to go through Allegiant to get reimbursed for the day we missed.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Allegiant lured my friends and I in with very affordable fares from Lansing MI to Sanford FL (there and back again) for a mini-holiday in mid-October 2014. Our flight from Lansing was on time and the gate staff were efficient and pleasant. We boarded on time made it out to the tarmac and the captain announced that they had an open flap sensor warning and couldn't take off. We were back at the gate for about 10 minutes to check out the issue and then FL bound. The flight lasted approx. 2.5 hours and we arrived on time even with the small delay. The McDonnell Douglas MD80 was clean and as comfortable as is to be expected with single aisle 3-2 seating. The flight back was on time and we arrived in Michigan earlier than expected. The flight attendants were pleasant on both flights (not overly attentive but did their job). Our flight back to MI was smooth. Keep in mind Allegiant is a budget airline. If you don't want to pay the $5 fee to print your boarding pass at the airport do it at home. Bring snacks if you don't want to pay for snacks on board. There are no free food or drinks. Allegiant makes their money by charging for extras. I am 5'3" and found the legroom to be sufficient. However if you are taller you may want to consider a row marked with extra legroom. I will say that we did pay extra when we booked our tickets to choose our seats (row 15 for minimal noise) and sit together. I recommend this if you are traveling with others and want to sit together. Allegiant got me to my destination safely efficiently and at a cost significantly less than other airlines. The added bonus of flying to/from smaller easier access airports not served by other airlines is a nice touch. I definitely would fly Allegiant again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flight was cheap. Flew from Duluth MN to Las Vegas. The flight out was freezing and the flight back was hot. They save money by not turning anything on until you're in the air. No assistance from staff and the pilot remarked more than once that they are only on the plane for our safety. They just talked to each other the whole flight each way. Did load the App on my phone and scanned ticket so we saved money. You get what you pay for. Just be ready for it and read the fine print.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew from Plattsburg NY to Sanford (Orlando) FL. The ride to and from was pleasant without any issues. I used their convenient iPhone app for boarding pass. Rode on an Airbus 320. It was a relatively short ride approx. 2hrs 20mins so you can't expect much. The airline caters to budget travellers with no frills. If you are looking for all the fancy stuff (reclining seats in-flight entertainment better food choices etc.) go elsewhere and pay more. As far as I'm concerned you get what you pay for and Allegiant fit my budget.

### Allegiant Air customer review
If you're flying out of Phoenix AZ area in the middle of the summer you may want to rethink this budget friendly airline! We arrived at the airport 2.5 Hrs prior to our flight leaving. Got through the baggage check security etc and arrived at our gate with about 1.5 hrs to spare. The temperature outside is well over 100 degrees so onboard the interior of the plane is very hot. Everyone is seated the plane is full and the flight attendants proceed to give the safety features etc meanwhile there is absolutely no air moving on that plane. I had no idea that Allegiant will not turn the air on until you've taken off! Meanwhile it is absolutely miserable! It would have been nice if the flight attendants would have at least made an announcement saying that they don't turn the a/c on until takeoff. The seats do not recline and there's very little leg room. I realize this is a cheap airline but I would rather pay more money to have the little extras like air conditioning during the summer in the desert seats that recline and free soda & snacks! After reading about others' horror stories with delays etc I'm thankful that we did not experience any of that! Our flights were on time but will not fly Allegiant again.

Flew from LEX KY to Punta Gorda Florida four times. The last time was April of this year. Arrived on time flight was great crew were nice and for the age of the plane wasn't bad for what I paid.

### Allegiant Air customer review
When our daughter decided to get married in Las Vegas my husband and I were not able to find a return flight on the necessary day so we decided to split our flights and we took a competitor's airline going to Vegas and Allegiant coming home to Billings Montana. The flight to Vegas was a dream I wish I could say the same for the flight coming home on Allegiant. First we are charged $10 for our boarding passes even though I told the lady that I had them on my phone. Then she told us our flight had been moved up an hour so we ran through the airport made it through security and up to the boarding area only to be told that our flight time had not changed. Then we get on the plane and are told that there are snacks available but only if you pay for them and that includes water and ice. I could not believe that after paying $300 for our tickets we couldn't even get a bottle of water for free. Throughout the 90 minute trip the flight attendants only came out of their little cubby hole when they were doing the safety check and to go down the aisle to see if anyone wanted to buy anything. They were rude and spent the entire flight talking to each other about personal happenings. I thought that I would save a few dollars by taking Allegiant but in the end it ended up costing me more than any of the other airlines. I can honestly say that I would rather pay a little more to be able to get a drink of water if I need one and to have someone friendly and happy to see me come on board.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I enjoyed Allegiant as a whole. I flew to Las Vegas with my two children aged 10 years and 3 years of age. Staff was polite and friendly in answering any questions since it was our first time flying this airline. My itinerary was done online so there wasn't any hidden charges to expect. On the way home from Las Vegas the plane was already there and waiting and we were an hour and half early. Allegiant will see me a lot more often.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Well as we all know you get what you pay for. And with Allegient airlines that isn't much. The flights are cancelled delayed etc you are left to fend for yourself. It's questionable if any other airline would honor their tickets. The airline seems to be run with contract employees that have no vested interest in doing a good job. Customer service is rock bottom and some of the language they use on customers would make a sailor blush. The flight attendants really have nothing to do so on the flights I was on they pulled out the food carts in the galley sat on them and had a party. The amount I saved booking with them was more than consumed by expenses I paid for the delays and the mental aggravation of dealing with this airline. Never again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Bellingham to Las Vegas - The MD80 was quite old but the cabin was clean and fine for a short flight. We had an aborted take off at Bellingham due to a faulty toilet. We stayed on the aircraft for an hour whilst they cleaned up the mess and took the lavatory out of service - lovely. At least we didn't have to change aircraft or get off the plane. We were on our way after an hour with no further delays or issue. The cabin crew were friendly and the pilots were very good at keeping everyone up to date with the delay and progress during the flight. I'd fly with Allegiant again although clearly they have reliability issues with their older aircraft which can cause unexpected delays but for the price I can't complain too much.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Allegiant Air was a bad experience for me and my 7 year old. Booked a trip from Punta Gorda to Knoxville I almost didn't make out of Punta Gorda. We got to the airport early and then the flight was delayed (all of the flights were continuously delayed). One ticketing agent said it was weather but the weather was clear where the flight was coming from so I asked another agent and she said they didn't have enough crew. We were packed in that small airport like sardines with kids screaming people yelling not enough seats for people to sit in. They cancelled some of the other flights but finally got another plane and crew that came from Fort Lauderdale for my flight. Six hours after arriving at the airport we finally left. After this experience I will pay the extra money for another airline. My chances of getting out of an airport on time are better and at least I will have the option of being rebooked on another flight or getting compensated. Budget airline = budget experience.

Yes the price is certainly right and a direct flight is a definite plus especially for my husband who is handicapped. However in that vein this airline is certainly not handicap friendly. Ask for a wheelchair and they will sling one at you at the Check In (wherever that is in the airport). Upon disembarking the flight attendant announced that wheelchair persons would have to wait until all (159) passengers had left the plane. When my husband and I moved up to the front seats to wait at a break in the line the flight attendant said "I told you to stay seated until all passengers had left the plane". When a person finally arrived with a wheelchair and helped my husband up to the gate that's as far as they go. Carrying two bags of medical supplies and pushing the wheelchair we trudged off to baggage claim and then lugged everything out to the curb around the corner to a taxi. Had the same treatment on the flight home. But as I said the price is certainly right and you get what you pay for!

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew from Bellingham to Las Vegas on September 8th. We were very weary after reading negative reviews but we were 100% satisfied. Flight was on time for take off but delayed for landing due to weather in Las Vegas. Great employees friendly service. Very impressed overall. Would definitely fly Allegiant again. Great value. No free food or entertainment but we knew this when we booked.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My parents have retired and moved to North Port Florida. Since March of 2013 I have flown on Allegiant Air 5 times. Besides one delay of about an hour we have always flown on time both ways. Oh by the way I fly out of Allentown Pa. Actually most of the returning flights have been early. I didn't mind the one delay it gave me an extra hour to enjoy a couple more cocktails. I do agree however the flight attendants are a tad bit rude. Maybe "short" is the correct word. But then again all they do is listen to a bunch of whimpering cry babies about a stupid delay. If you want first class go fly another airline and pay double the amount for a ticket. I also fly my 2 boys with me so I really can't complain about paying $500 to $650 for 3 round trip non stop tickets to see the parents for a week. Not to mention Allentown pa is 20 minutes from my home and Punta Gorda is 25 minutes from my parents. I will always fly Allegiant.

Do not be tempted by the cheap prices. You are assuming incorrectly that Allegiant will actually get you there and back. Wrong. July 2014: Return flight home from SFB (Sanford Florida) cancelled at the gate at boarding time on a Friday afternoon. This effectively left passengers stranded at an airport with no other flights out to the destination because flights out of SFB are very limited. MCO (Orlando International) is 30 miles south with ample alternative flights. However the Allegiant gate agent offered no group ground transportation to MCO offered no lodging and offered no thoughts on other flights out. Essentially: "You are stranded here and on your own for getting out. Because I travel with an Internet connected device I was able to buy a last-minute ticket on Delta (at last-minute prices) from MCO. I was able finally to find a rental car one way (cab fare was $135). My "cheap" Allegiant ticket cost me about $1000. I could have spent the entire weekend at the airport or at a nearby motel hoping to catch a flight out on Monday. When you buy an Allegiant ticket you are buying a chance - a hope - and gambling.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Outbound flight Las Vegas to Grand Rapids (MI) was fine but on the return Allegiant had some staffing problems which led to delays and more delays and the flight eventually took off a full day late. It would not have been so bad if they had just been honest up front but they piecemeal the delays provided little information - and sometimes misinformation - and at times they were downright rude particularly on the phone where it was very challenging to get through in the first place. For the trouble they offered up a $100 voucher good only on the same route. The lost time and aggravation cost in many ways much more than anything I saved on a discount fare. Never again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew from Orlando (Sanford) to Grand Rapids MI. Just a few things to be aware of - the weight limit on checked bags is 40 pounds. You are allowed one free carry-on bag provided it will fit under your seat. You have to pay to use the overhead compartment (the overhead compartments were bare on my flight). The seats are tight and do not recline. While boarding and sitting on the runway - Allegiant turns the cabin air conditioning down to save fuel so depending on the outside temperature it can get pretty hot. Their airplane fleet is made up primarily of older McDonnell-Douglas MD-80's - cabins show their age - noises and creaks aplenty. The flight crew aren't particularly helpful or pleasant but suffice. Now the positive - my ticket was 139 dollars. There you go.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My Honolulu to LAX and LAX to HNL flights were a disaster. Reading the reviews this particular Allegiant route seems to be a problem route for Allegiant. HNL to LAX flight was delayed continuously for 5 hours. A 7.55 am flight turned into 1.00 pm flight. The return flight was continuously delayed until finally the flight was canceled until the following day. A 15 hour delay. Rather than return to the city and rent a hotel room I was fortunate to book a flight on Hawaiian Airlines and make it back home. Customer service staff was openly hostile to enraged customers. I have never in all of my travels seen such a large group of travelers so upset. I was offered a $200 Allegiant voucher for the delay but I cannot ever see myself using this airline again. The risk stress and wasted days are just not worth the $100 you save.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My return trip from Ft. Wayne In. was delayed for 1.5 hrs while waiting on the plane. We were told after boarding that they were waiting for maintenance to arrive in order to replenish plane with oxygen. This was during dinner time so everyone was hungry. When we finally took off we were told we would get a complementary non- alcoholic drink. It consisted of a tiny plastic cup filled mostly with ice. We should have at least have got a full can plus a snack. Really cheap airline. This was at least the 5th time I have experienced delays due to mechanical problems.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Horrible experience going from LA to Hawaii and from Hawaii to LA. Our flight was canceled twice the second time the plane took off but the generator was not working so we had to return to the island. The ticket may look cheap but they will charge you for every thing! Your bags change in seats and so forth. They don't even provide you with a glass of water unless you purchase it.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We know what to expect from a budget airline. But Allegiant has in my opinion has got worse instead of better. On our most recent trip Bellingham WA to Oakland CA we experienced lengthy delays on both outbound and return flights. A 2 hour delay leaving Bellingham and a 2+ hour delay on the return flight. Allegiant provided free beverages at both airports. Sodas and water in Bellingham and a half glass of water in Oakland. I think it's time for this airline to have a look at the business model. You don't save enough money flying Allegiant to make up for the almost guaranteed inconvenience of flying with them. We will think long and hard before purchasing another ticket on Allegiant. I must say that this is not my first bad experience with Allegiant but it will be my last.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We arrived at LAX for at 9am for a 10.55am flight to Provo UT (80 minute flight). We have now been informed that the flight is not scheduled to leave until 6.25pm. I am a 40 year old woman and have flown all my life and I have never experienced this type of a delay especially for this short of a flight. Allegiant is cheap but this is inexcusable. I am traveling with a toddler and as it stands right now we have spent over 7 hours at the airport and will probably be here at least 2 more hours if not more. No one will let us know what is going on.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We arrived at the airport 2 hours prior to the flight. We encountered an enormous line with not enough attendants to get everyone through. We waited for an hour+ in the line and then approached the counter to express our concern. We waited behind others who were complaining for another 20 minutes or so. We were then told that we had missed our flight and for $75 we could catch their next flight 3 days later. We persisted but in a very respectful manner. Other families in the same situation were also at the counter and were very angry. I saw this was not working so I took a different approach. I was accused of lying about the time I spent in line. I was told I had no other recourse. There was nobody I could complain to other than another rude lady on the phone. After exhausting all other avenues I went to Delta Airways who were able to book me on a flight. for $1200 for 2 people. They said they were willing to transfer the flight if Allegiant was willing to do that given it was their lineups that caused the delay. Allegiant refused this and again accused me of lying and then said I should have been there 2.5 hours before the flight so it was my fault. Service at the counter was excellent. Service on the flight was professional and friendly. Everything I had experienced with Allegiant on the trip to Vegas and the frustrating airport experience on the way back was the opposite of what I experienced with Delta.

### Allegiant Air customer review
You should not use Allegiant if you have any time constraints. When they're good they're pretty good but when they're bad they're horrible! We have flown Allegiant Air at least 5 times and ignored a problem or two because it was cheap. Usually there was an hour or two delay. One time there were no attendants at the counter and when it was time to board all passengers boarded. An Allegiant employee came aboard and in a very nasty tone threatened to have us all arrested. Our last flight had a "delay" of over 10 hours and that's just not acceptable. We were given a $50 Allegiant voucher. No thank you.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Have used this airline 2 times out of Plattsburgh NY via For Lauderdale FL. We experienced issues on both occasions departing Fort Lauderdale. The first incident was back in December 2012 - flight was delayed for 8 hours and then in December 2013 flight was cancelled until the next day. I will not fly this airline again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My first Allegiant Air experience. I booked two weeks in advance. Traveled from LAX to Idaho Falls. I go to Jackson Hole WY every summer and I always have to get creative about getting there as there are always high ticket prices. I decided to give this airline a go. Both flights were on time - every aspect was fine. Yes it is no-frills and you pay for everything but if you know that going in you can adapt. We became better packers and brought our own food onboard.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I flew Allegiant for the first time from Las Vegas to Moline Illinois 8/8/14 and returned on 8/15/14. Both flights were on time and very convenient as they were non stop. Prior to these flights all my trips were on other airlines where I had layovers and plane changes which added lots of extra travel time. I was very pleased with the check in service I received. The seats were comfortable for a three hour flight. I did not need a food or beverage service during the short flights. The charges for luggage still did not make the total cost more than for the flights of the other non direct carriers. I would fly Allegiant again and I wanted to make my good experiences known because I read many of the comments before my flight and some were quite negative.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Columbus to Myrtle Beach. Flying out of Rickenbacker was great-parking at $5 per day. No delay and nice employees to deal with. Paid $5 for a snack package on the plane. Good enough for 3 kids. Myrtle Beach to Columbus. Nice airport and easy car rental. Employee at the gate check in and boarding had a poor attitude. Changed seats on us at the last minute. They board you in zones 2-4. In that order. We sat in the last row of the plane but they wanted us to board in zone 4? Made no sense-I've always seen the back of the plane board first but maybe that makes to much sense to me. Anyway I would recommend this MD-80 plane and Allegiant even though seats don't recline.

### Allegiant Air customer review
This was my worst flying experience. Every other time I've flown with no problems. My Son was able to fly from Bentonville to Orlando with his personal bag with no problems. On the way back we are forcedbto pay a $50 baggage fee to get the bag on the flight only to get back to Bentonville Ar. to find out the bag was left but the fees where still charged and then reversed and charged again! I think the ticket agents that worked the 12.56pm flight leaving Sanford Airport on Aug 8 2014 need to take a few classes.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I was initially worried about flying with Allegiant when I read all of the terrible reviews. Shockingly neither of my flights were delayed from LAX to Honolulu. If you're a low maintenance person then this airline is for you. You get what you pay for no reclining seats no complimentary beverages ($2 for a can of ginger ale not bad in my opinion) no inflight entertainment you have to pay for any extra features and to check in your bags. The staff was very friendly. We even landed 20 minutes early coming back to LAX since everyone on the flight checked in early. The only reason why I took this flight was because it was $400 cheaper than the next flight. I would have no problem flying with Allegiant again to save a few dollars!

### Allegiant Air customer review
After some apparent misrepresentations about our 1st plane we left Sanford at about the same time that we should have arrived in Allentown. Of course we boarded a 2nd plane only about 1.5 hours late but could not depart because it had an A/C problem which was corrected in a mere hour as we sat entombed under the FL sun! No flight attendants displayed name badges. Does that tell you anything?

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew Allegiant June 30th to Vegas and back on July 4th Trip was great. Left ATW on time and arrived in Vegas on the.time The ticket counter were great no problems Flight crew were just fine. Ok the seats don't recline no big deal only 3 1/2 hour flight. We brought our own snacks and bought soda at the airport. Return trip also left on time and arrived on times. ALL in all Love flying Allegiant we have never problems never once a delayed flight going to keep flying with them.

### Allegiant Air customer review
July 31st stuck at airport. Flight has been delayed. From all the reviews I have read this is apparently a reoccurring issue with this airline. Allegiant need to get their act together. They charge for everything so don't think you are saving money because you are not. You can fly better airlines and save yourself the stress.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Allegiant flew me from Youngstown to Punta Gorda and back again safely and close to on time. If this is all you require from your trip Allegiant should be fine if you expect more well you are barking up the wrong cockpit. Allegiant clearly spells out charges on their website I am baffled when people go and book their ticket on Allegiant yet are angered for getting exactly what was promised! If you want creature comforts Allegiant is not the fuselage for you. I flew with my father from Youngstown OH to Punta Gorda Florida. The flight was on time on the way down and about 20 minutes late coming back. Flying on Allegiant - both in terms of ambience and clientele - is much closer than taking a Greyhound than to flying say Delta. The MD-80s look pretty on the outside but inside are spartan and old. Creature comfort is merely a theory: The seats are thin and don't recline and forget any kind of magazine: Please see the seat pocket in front of you for the safety information card and a booklet full of advertisements. One benefit of flying Allegiant is the airports Allegiant services which are smaller and while they might not be centrally located the wait and service and overall calm is far superior to the bigger airports. The time it took me to walk into Punta Gorda airport check in get through TSA then flop down into a seat at the gate? Literally 5 minutes. When you fly Allegiant you are taking a calculated risk: You are hoping that your flight doesn't get cancelled for whatever reason because unlike the big carriers Allegiant can't put you on another flight: they only operate one flight per day to each destination - at least in the smaller cities - and they don't work with other airlines. So if your flight is cancelled you won't get to your destination until the next day most likely. That is the risk you take in exchange for Allegiant's low fares.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Outbound flight was 4 hours delayed. We were locked in gate area with no food or beverage service. Prior to delay flight attendants acted immature and more concerned about showing kids the cockpit than getting passengers settled and allowing captain to do his job. After we finally had another plane show up the flight attendant had the gall to refuse me a glass of water I was told water 8s $2 per bottle. Now on the return it is delayed and there is no one at gate to tell us when it will be here. Totally deserted. The most inept service ever. I will never fly them again. Do not fly Allegiant they do not care if or when you get to your destination.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We just came back from our vacation to Florida flying round trip from NIA to PIE with 11 people including 3 seniors 3 young adults 4 kids (ranging from 3 to 11 in age) and a 2 month old infant. After reading the reviews here we were very concerned especially about the delays but were pleasantly surprised. Both flights exactly on time and arrived a little earlier than scheduled. The staff both in the airline as well as at the airport were extremely helpful and extra friendly. The airplane on the way there was a little older but on the way back the plane seemed new. This is a budget airline with the lowest rates around so that needs to be kept in mind. There are no frills luggage is charged a premium and there are no free refreshments. IMO the flight is just to get me to my destination quickly safely and at a reasonable rate so I will definitely be traveling with Allegiant again.

Allentown to Orlando Sanford on 28th July 2014 and return flight from Orlando Sanford to Allentown on 1st August 2014. Very poor quality airline used them from PA to Florida and back and they were over 3 hrs late going and 2 hrs late returning the staff attitude ranged from poor to average and if I had a choice I would not fly with them again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Supposed to fly from Peoria IL to Vegas on July 24 at 8pm. Flight was canceled due to an engine issue. We were rescheduled to the following day July 25 at 5pm. Unfortunately there was a three hour delay. We lost 24 hours of our trip. While Peoria is a pleasant little town can you really equate 24 hours there to be the same as 24 hours in Vegas? On the return flight July 27 we boarded without issue at 2.20pm. We were on the plane for 3 hours before we even took flight - we were 44th in line for take off and then ran low on fuel. Pilot took us back to terminal to gas up. For our inconvenience Allegiant Air offered us vouchers totalling $150 for our next flight. Problem is we are never flying with them again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I knew what we were getting into with this airline. We were prepared for the worst. With that said we followed every little thing they asked on their website from online check in to weighing each check in luggage and their app to check for delays. Our party consisted of 5 Adults 3 children and 2 infants. Maybe its sheer luck that we escaped going to our vacation in Oahu and coming back to LAX. The flight going to Oahu was on time they did not give anything complimentary but that's expected. Yes the seats did not recline. We brought food and drinks from the LAX. Flight left approximately 2pm. The delay came from LAX only having one runway available. Our entire party came in 2 hours early just in case. At the check-in line everything went through without a hitch no additional fees added. 8 days later we had an early flight 9.30 am going back to LAX. Again we knew what to expect We did the online check in and printed the boarding passes constantly checking alerts for delays through the app/text alert. They had 2 lines at Lobby 6 one for online check in the other is a more general line. I'm glad we did the online check in the general line was a bit too long. Got through ticket counter no hitches. After the TSA check point we were in gate 22 along with other passengers with 45 minutes to spare. Bought food and drinks at the airport. After boarding I noticed the plane had some condensation dripping from the ceiling. The window by my seat was broken had a tough time trying to close it so light couldn't get in. Flight left on time arrived in LAX on time. When we arrived there was a shuttle to take us to the gate I don't know if that's normal but everything else came through okay. They even gave us free drinks since my sister's twin infants were pretty quiet for the duration of the flight. The crew were nice gave the kids badges. With that said I would fly with them again. With knowing what to expect. A couple of things check in online and sign for text alerts if you can don't check in luggage if you can get away with a carryon. Be prepared just in case of delays.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Do not recommend! Flight from Stockton CA was great but there was a 3 hour delay from LV to Stockton. For a 1 hour flight - a 3 hour wait? There is not even bad weather. They only offered complementary drinks. Not worth it.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Stockton to Las Vegas. Hear all these complaints so I was a little worried when I booked. The flight left on time pilots and crew very friendly landed in Vegas - ready to go and on time. Also these super 80's they fly might be old but they deliver a smooth ride. I'll definitely fly this outfit again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We have recently travelled with Allegiant on flights to and from Vegas/Hawaii. Never again! The flight was 6 hours only snacks could be purchased inflight and only by credit card (being from the UK this would incur all kinds of extra charges) and could not be purchased with cash. Allegiant also purposely sat myself and my partner at opposite ends of the plane so we were forced to pay the extra charge to sit next to each other even though there were plenty of spare seats next to each other on the plane. This happened both ways. Seats do not recline at all not even a tiny bit and were uncomfortable. Will not fly with this company again.

July 18th from CVG to Sanford was a 4 hour delay no explanation except computers went down/very costly after you pay for seat choice/carry on/luggage/and no customer service whatsoever.

I thought this was one of the worst travel experiences I've ever had. It was the first time I flew with my 5 month old daughter we were the last to board my husband and son boarded first they had no priority boarding for people with small children the aircraft was old and dirty. There was a charge for everything including carry ons which I paid but refused to pay the fee to sit together. I thought the airline was tacky and cheap. I can understand paying for something that's new or worth it but this airline was old and sub standard. Luckily it was a short flight.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew from CVG to Myrtle Beach on July 18th (flight 1113) and returned to CVG on July 25th (6pm gate B2). Both flights were delayed for over 2 hrs. The return flight was loaded and taxied with a 30 minute delay the final 1.5 hours was sitting on a plane with no air in the Myrtle Beach sun. Staff was nice and did their best older flight attendant (woman) was spectacular. Sorry doubt if we will use this airline again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
If Allegiant could do what they promise it could be a great but they can't seem to do that. Not enough pilots or planes no back up planes. My May 26th flight from Peoria to Vegas was cancelled after several delays. At 1am the desk girl gleefully announced the plane had arrived everybody cheered. Then after everybody got off the plane she announced with great surprise that the crew had timed out and couldn't fly. Something passengers had already figured would probably happen. Allegiant should have told us earlier so we didn't have to sit around the airport for 3 hours waiting. They knew but didn't tell the passengers. They also add on extra fees to make you think the flight is going to be cheaper. I want to like and fly this airline it could be great. This is just one incident of many messed up trips.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Recently flew from Bangor Maine to Orlando Florida. Excellent service friendly flight attendants. Departed and arrived on time both leaving and returning. The ticket agent however in Bangor was not very helpful. My daughter and husband were travelling with two children and required a baby seat. They had checked and were told the baby seat was allowed with no charge. The agent didn't think the car seat qualified. After bringing in another to consult she finally allowed it but was not very nice about it. A little customer service goes a long way. A great experience and I would take this flight to Orlando again.

Sanford to Rickenbacker flight 614 on 7/10/14 and the return trip from Rickenbacker to Sanford flight 615 on 7/17/14. Horrible experience. Twice to the flight line and twice unable to takeoff due to equipment problems. Finally they subbed another plane. Our flight was over 6 hours late. Dirty plane diaper contents under seat in front of us. Old noted silicone caulk around and on emergency hatches. I have to add mouthy rude sarcastic staff.

My daughter and I flew from Avoca Pa to Sanford Orlando from July 3-10. We greatly enjoyed our smooth flights and onboard service. However there were delays going down and coming back of about an hour. I know Allegiant has great deals but need to improve on these delays for better traveling. Even though there were delays I will still chose Allegiant for future travels due to the value and convenience.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We took a flight from Phoenix-Gateway to Hawaii in July 2014 and I was not impressed. The aircraft was okay but once airborne they announced there was no food available for sale other than chips and drinks. A 6 hour flight and no food? Our return was delayed 5 hours. No reason given. The flight originated in Hawaii so it had to be a maintenance issue. During our 5 hour wait we were forced to move so another airline could use our area to feed their customers. The ticket prices and their charging practices would be considered deceptive anywhere else. I've been traveling for nearly 40 years in the US and abroad and I have to say worst airlines ever. Don't do it. In the end the price is the same (or cheaper) going with a real customer oriented company.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We recently flew to Los Angeles with Allegiant Air and are thrilled that we have discovered this affordable airline option. We read all of their information so knew to weigh our luggage before leaving home as well as to bring our own snacks. We had a 50 minute flight delay which we were informed about via text. We downloaded their app which also enabled us to check in 24 hrs before and avoid the need for printing boarding passes. We had a gate change again no big deal. All the gates are in the same large room at LAX. The staff were helpful and informative - one suitcase was slightly overweight. They gave us time to transfer some items to another suitcase to avoid paying overage charges. We had a suitcase go missing - it was fed exed to our hotel after being located with Customer Service being very helpful with this issue. I would much rather pay these kinds of prices (our savings approx $1000 for 2 people) then pay to have an airline provide me an onboard coke and movie. I have dealt with flight delays lost luggage and gate changes with other airlines as well so feel these issues are not unique to Allegiant Air.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Bellingham to Vegas. Flight was to depart 11.05 am. At 8 am we received notice flight would be delayed 30 minutes. About 1 hour later while heading to the airport to be 2 hours early we received a second text saying flight delayed again until 1.30. Stop for breakfast and get to the airport 2 hours early as requested. Get a 3rd text explaining flight is delayed until 3.30. How did it take 3 cracks to figure out when we were leaving? Seat assignments caused another 30 minute delay as passengers boarded. Allegiant flies about 8 trips a day to Vegas and it is certainly not uncommon to expect delays. Luckily we only sat in the plane in Vegas in 110 degree temperatures for an extra hour delay on the return trip. Sounds bad but certainly an improvement. So if you plan on taking advantage of the cheap flight remember you get what you pay for and don't expect any professionalism or comfort along the way.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew from Ashville to Punta Gorda. When I got to the airport I was told that the flight was delayed due to a mechanical we were expected to be late about 3 hours no offer of a voucher for a meal nor did they apologize it was very matter of fact. When we boarded the plane the first thing I noticed was how dirty and tattered the plane was it was an older MD-80. My seat was clean didn't recline I was more annoyed with the garbage that was surrounding my seat and in my seat back pocket and when I rang my Flight Attendant call light I was approached by a rude older male flight attendant who refused to take the garbage until after we took off. Once we were at cruising altitude the crew came out and sold all sorts of snacks and beverages not bad. Had an issue with my hand baggage being in the aisle. Allegiant as a whole was not a bad experience the ticket was inexpensive I would like if Allegiant perhaps gave their Flight Attendants especially those lovely seniors a class in etiquette and professionalism.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My flight was delayed a total of 7 hours because the Allegiant crew failed to make proper mechanical checks before departure. I arrived a full 2 hours before the flight was scheduled to leave. We boarded on schedule then sat in our cramped hot seats for 90 minutes. Then we were asked to deplane so the crew could fix something. We then sat in the terminal for 2.5 hours. We boarded again. We deplaned again. We boarded a final time and were actually able to take off from LAX. I arrived home 10 hours past my original arrival time. Obviously I will never be flying with Allegiant again!

### Allegiant Air customer review
Never ever again. The planes are not clean the staff are not friendly and the fees are unbelievable. The maximum luggage weight is 40 lbs which will render a full size suitcase overweight almost 100% of the time. Starting September 2014 they are going to start charging to print boarding passes at the airport. Relentless!

### Allegiant Air customer review
TOL (Toledo) Ohio to PGD (Punta Gorda) Florida. Check In: Went smooth no issues with checking in and sent on my way. Security: Efficient and quick. Boarding: Very unorganized the gate agents didn't seem to have a grasp on customer service either. Boarding announced by someone who couldn't speak properly into the phone and 90% of her message never came through we all just sort of looked perplexed and formed a queue only to be snapped at for not boarding in the correct manner of which we never really heard. Upon entry into the old and tattered MD-80 we were greeted by a very sweet young lady and an older middle aged asian man who never smiled and he swiftly snapped at me "Seat Sir" he was the lead flight attendant and we all would endure his wrath later. Flight: Take off was quick the crew were up and out in the aisle within an hour after take off that probably had something to do with the argument the flight attendants were having in the rear. Once in the aisle the crew were pleasant and were very happy to be doing their jobs or at least they appeared so. Overall: You get for what you pay for apart from that not too bad.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Oakland CA to Provo Utah. Initially I was very excited to use this airline as I saw that the price for the trip was much less expensive than the usual commercial airlines flying into SLC. However I was disappointed as I continued the checking process and realized that I had to pay additional money for seats and for carry-on luggage. I then realized the total cost is not that significantly cheaper than Delta or another big airline. However I bought my tickets only 3 weeks in advance and may have saved significant money if I had purchased the tickets much earlier. I arrived to OAK 2.5 hours early in case there were any problems. Security clearance was a breeze. I am happy to say that there were no issues with delays or cancellations on this leg of the trip. The service was very good. Yes all beverages/snacks must be purchased but it is only a 1.5 hr flight and really who needs to drink/eat in that time. I can see why customers complained about the comfort of the seats as the backs are very thin and do not give a lot of cushion support. Anyway I had paid for a first row seat and I'm glad I did as I could easily get off the plane without waiting. I'm happy to say that I had no problems with my flight but I do wish the total price of the trip was much more of a "deal" than what I got in reality.

Flew July 11 2014 from Las Vegas to Casper WY - flight attendants were either inattentive or rude. Thought it was just a one time occurrence but we flew back from Casper WY to Las Vegas on Monday July 14th and the crew was worse. Plane was filthy front lavatory was inoperable. Spend the extra money and fly on an airline that at least acknowledges that are a person first and a customer second!

### Allegiant Air customer review
July 9/14 checked in at 4.30am for a 6.30 flight to Fargo ND. Our tickets were for gate 31 but verbally told to go to gate 39. It was approaching 6.30 and my daughter asked the 2 staff there why we were not boarding yet and she told us our plane was at gate 31! Got to the gate at 6.25ish and there were 3 other people there as well we had missed our flight. We could see the plane still there but the door was locked. There were no staff to assist. The plane remained at the runway terminal for about 15 min. The next flight out of L.A. airport to Fargo was 3 days away! Our only option to get back home was to take a flight to Sioux Falls South Dakota rent a car and drive to Fargo. The flight to Sioux was delayed 1.5 hrs but miraculously it was ready in about 20min. So were were led out of the airport onto the tarmac and loaded from the rear of the plane! Allegiant Air does not have a PA system so they solely rely on yelling loud enough for their passengers to hear of any changes or to advise of boarding! I will say that they decided to waive the 75.00 fee for switching to fly to Sioux or at least for 4 of us that I know of. We paid for preferred seating yet out of Fargo 2 of us had what we paid for and one ticket had been changed for seating 4 rows back. Luckily one seat was empty and we were able to sit in preferred.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Our flight to Oakland from Phoenix-Mesa was delayed 3 hours (no other flights in either area were delayed) and then we waited an hour at Oakland until our luggage came. No explanation was given. I am currently at the gate waiting for my return flight which was just delayed 40 minutes because one of the flight attendants has not arrived yet.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I recently used this airline to travel round trio from Belleville IL to Orlando FL. I suppose to summarize I would categorize this as a fair airline. If you are planning travel with them make sure you take note of all the charges as basically everything (including advance seat selection etc) has an a la carte separate charge. Also the departing flight was two hours late and there was no explanation given by Allegiant staff as to why. The advantage of this airline is it flew out of a small general aviation airport that obviated the need for me to travel to St Louis. Recommended but be aware of all charges and propensity to lateness.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Rockford to Orlando round trip. Long delays both legs. The rudest flight attendants would rather sit in back and Delayed by 6 hours on 6/23 from Rockford to Tampa. Delayed by over 3 hours on 7/4 from Tampa to Rockford with no information about why there was a delay. Last month I had a similar delay from Rockford to Tampa and a flight cancelled from Tampa to Rockford. (On that flight they gave us a 100 credit but it cost me $50 in airport cab fare.) Always seems to be a delay with this airline.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I was a loyal Allegiant customer from their inception flying with them dozens of times. My last 3 flights via Allegiant have been cancelled/rescheduled - all for supposed mechanical issues for the following day - often after our having already been en route to the airport. That's 3 flights within 30 days! Customer service is non- existent. Communications about status are lagging even with signing up for text alerts. Yesterday's flight was rescheduled 4 times in 8 hours only to finally be cancelled after passengers had been held all day on standby/stand down. The only compensation offered is a $100 travel voucher for future travel.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Fly from GSP to SFB frequently. If you like riding a bus this is the airline for you. Cheap yes. In every way. Their fares look great until you start adding up all the extra charges. Never on time and if you have baggage pack a meal while you wait for it! Most uncomfortable seating ever. I guess if you only fly once a year it's OK to be inconvenienced but if you need to be somewhere on time look elsewhere!

### Allegiant Air customer review
On July 3 I lflew out of Asheville NC for Sanford/Orlando as this was my first time flying with Allegiant. I printed out my online boarding pass arrived before the time indicated and received an official boarding pass which indicated which gate I was to go to board the plane. The flight was on time and the pilot and crew were very courteous. Was a great flight! However the return was a disaster! On July 6 I was to fly out of Palm Beach Intentional. As before I printed my online boarding pass and arrived before the time indicated. This time I did not receive an official boarding pass indicating what time I was to go to board the plane. Instead I received the printed boarding pass that I proved which was torn in half and the gate number written on it. She instructed me to go to the left towards security and afterwards I would see the areas that indicated which gates. I went through security as usual and then proceeded to the gate written on the boarding pass. At the gate there were very few people there and I saw no Allegiant advertising. I asked someone who worked at the airport and she said yes you have the right gate. Since ever all flights were being delayed due to bad weather in the area I thought mine had been as well. About 10 minutes after the flight was to take off I saw one of the Allegiant employees who had been checking people in when I arrived. I asked if the flight had been delayed. She told me no I had missed my flight. I showed her my boarding pass with the hand written gate number on it. She informed me that that was the wrong gate and that she didn't recognize the hand writing. I feel that if I had been given an official boarding pass that indicated the gate number I would not have missed my flight.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Rockford to Orlando round trip. Long delays both legs. The rudest flight attendants would rather sit in back and play with their phones. When they have delays or cancellations you are in trouble since only one flight to destinations every few days. First and last time using them. I will stick with major airlines. Not a convenience of small airport or saving if not able to get to where you are going.

### Allegiant Air customer review
June 22/23 were 859 and 5859 from CVG to PIE. After experiencing 7 delays plus a total cancellation of our flight on June 22 this is the bottom line (according to me). Allegiant is simply unable to accommodate delays (weather/mechanical) flight crew timing out or what have you. The fleet is very small so they cannot put you on another flight like the other big carriers can nor do they have contracts with other airlines to re-book you and get you on your way. After the headaches disappointment worry and trouble I went through for my trip the savings was just not worth it. Its not to say that Delta does not experience issues they do they are just better able to accommodate and/or offer options.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My family flew out of Knoxville Tennessee to Sanford Florida on Flight 697 Sunday June 29 2014. This was our first and last time flying with Allegiant. The overhead cool air did not work. Therefore the air in the plane was hot and stale. We had to fan ourselves with the Allegiant emergency instruction card. I am thankful the card was available as that is the only good comment I would have for Allegiant. Allegiant's staff were fully aware the air was not working during the previous flight as well. We were advised air was blown into the plane to cool it down inside as the inside temperature was over 85% from the previous flight and that the problem was repaired prior to our boarding. The repair statement was not true. Shame on Allegiant and the staff as well. Being truthful and apologizing for the problem would have made a difference. Instead their lack of concern and deceit has lost three customers.

My daughter's Flight 150 scheduled to leave Mesa AZ to Missoula MT on July 5 2014 at 7.40am finally left at 4pm and only made it to Idaho Falls. Bus transported passengers who did not want to wait until July 6 at 12.40 pm to take flight to Missoula. Bus arrived in Missoula around 1 am praying flight back will be uneventful. Please give staff more training in being courteous to inconvenienced travelers.

### Allegiant Air customer review
July 5th flight 101 Cedar Rapids to Phoenix-Mesa. It's very nice that once you get on the plane you know you won't have to worry about connecting flights and the seats are fairly comfortable. However the airline is almost never on time. Today's (I mean tomorrow's because it left after midnight) was over 3 hours late and it wasn't weather related. I'm also getting the impression they really don't care if they're late because they know they don't have to worry about connecting flights. I used to balance the inconvenience with the cheaper cost but now with all the extras you have to pay they really aren't much cheaper than the major airlines and they sure are a lot less reliable. I used to seek out Allegiant flights. I think now I'm going to try to avoid them. Too bad.

### Allegiant Air customer review
6/12 flight No. 2073 departing at 8.30 am. Allegiant has no secrets of who and what they are. My trip from LAX to Hawaii was on time. Check-in was quicker than others Allegiant does not have as many forms and paperwork. Flight crew was pleasant and offered good service. Yes $2 for water or coke-but only $5 for Vodka on the rocks. If you are over 6 feet your knees will be flush against the seat in front of you. We saved $140 each on our round trip to and from Hawaii. I will use them again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
6/19 - 6/26. Flight 1115 and 1114. I recently flew from LEX to Myrtle Beach and back on this airline. I read all the directions and requirements showed up prepared and on time with the luggage I prepaid for. It was a wonderful experience and a great bargain. I hope they keep this flight because I plan to use it several times a year and with the friendly staff and price it has made my trips possible.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I just returned from a round trip on Allegiant from Greensboro - St. Pete. I have absolutely no complaints about the airline. This is a super discount airline. If you keep that in mind when you book your reservation you should not be too surprised when the final price of your ticket is determined. I have no comment on delayed flights. On none of the ~10 round-trips that I have taken with Allegiant have we been delayed more than 1/2 hour. Cabin crew and ground crew on all flights have been courteous and professional. I will definitely be flying Allegiant again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I was on two flights: from Phoenix to Sioux falls SD and back. My flight to Sioux Falls was delayed 3 hours because of an attendant who called in sick and no one was available. My return flight #123 was delayed when the plane would not start. It was delayed and delayed and delayed. Each for an hour or two. Finally at 9.35 pm my 1.34 flight was cancelled. Although I was housed overnight at a local hotel even that was a challenge. I had flown 2 times before with no trouble but that was a few years back. I cannot trust arrival or return any more. My co-workers wife had a similar experience just yesterday.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I am waiting for my delayed flight out of Des Moines airport as I write this review. My husband and I have been here since 4.40 when check-in for the 6.51 flight opened. It is now almost 8pm. In the over 3 hours we have been here we have received two texts advising of delays. When we checked in we were advised of the first delay and later also heard over the airport PA that the flight had been delayed a second time. Our flight is now due to depart after 10pm for a 1.30 am arrival in Orlando. Around 7.00 we decided we should get some dinner since we were going to be up and in the air until the wee hours. So we visit every restaurant on the gate side of security to learn every single one closes their grill at 7pm. We go back to the gate and the only airport personnel we can find tells us they don't work for Allegiant and they cant help us. After talking to one of the cashiers we find out the restaurants on the other side of security are open until 8.30. So we get TSA's blessing and head out in search of food. After securing a meal my husband decides to visit the Allegiant ticket counter to complain. His point and mine is if you are going to delay flights until after the restaurants close you'd think they could let passengers know food wont be available. It's not like the passengers from out of state know anything about this small airport's business practices. Instead of nodding apologizing and offering some words of comfort the ticket agent asked for my husband's license. As my husband handed it over and told the agent he didn't want a free ticket or drink vouchers the agent said "I'm not giving you anything free. I'm kicking you off the flight. My husband had to basically beg to be let back on the flight and was told if they heard any more comments or complaints about or from him he would not get on the plane. I assure you we will never fly Allegiant again!

### Allegiant Air customer review
LAX-ICT. I've flown routes with them in the past. I'm a frequent traveler and pretty flexible but this trip took the cake and I will never fly with them again. Gate/ticket area agents lack either knowledge or skill or both and are not of any assistance. Flights are never on time. Text alerts are sketchy at best so no predictability in communication. You will pay whether it's in the very high baggage fees/change fees/seat fees/lost time.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew from Provo Utah for my honeymoon. We got a good price but in all honesty we're more than willing now to travel the 60 minutes to Salt Lake to fly on any other airline for a little higher price. The comfort of the seats on the Allegiant flights was horrendous and the service staff was cold and ironically un-serviceable. Our flight back from LAX was also delayed for no apparent reason but I got a text when we finally boarded that informed me my flight was delayed. Communication was horrible. Luckily my wife and I are a little more aware in airport situations; a couple sitting next to us thought they'd missed their flight because the marquee above our gate had changed and no announcement had been made about the delay. Very poor customer service. The hour and a half I save in driving time to our local airport is not worth what I lose out on with more professional airlines.

Have flown out of Grand Island NE to Phoenix/Mesa twice in the past two years. All departures were on time as well as arrivals. Staff at both ends pleasant. Can't speak of any other routes but this particular one seems to be doing a good job. Mesa airport can't be beat from what I have experienced.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I flew from Portsmouth NH to Punta Gorda FL in May on vacation with a friend. Everything about the flight itself was mostly fine. Free parking walk right in and check your bags with hardly any waiting. Security was quick and the flight was on time. They did have some computer glitches and thought it would be delayed however it was not. I did have two issues one was resolved the other was not. My TV screen did not work. They reset it 3 times and finally it worked. My biggest issue however was the return flight. 40 minutes from landing they put the seatbelt sign on with no warning. Then they absolutely refused to allow anyone to use the restroom. Several people tried to use the restroom and they made them sit back down and wait until landing.I will use Allegiant again because it was cheap and very convenient.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Have flown several times with Allegiant without incident. Typically I've showed up about an hour before departure time with only carry on. The Plattsburg NY airport has one flight departing at that time and therefore with pre- check-in done and a boarding pass security is a 3-5 minute affair and I'd wait about 35-40 min to board. Pleasant professional on-board staff. Departs on time arrives on time. No complaints until I should up a bit late. Traveling with wife daughter and two young grand children to FL for a family vaca. Due to circumstances beyond our control the usual 2 hr drive took 2.5 hrs. 30 min before departure they refused to check our one pre- paid checked bag saying no room left but directed us to security and suggested we gate check it. This made no sense to me cause gate checked goes in regular baggage hold which is apparently full. The large bag with fluids clearly got the attention of TSA and stalled our progress for about 10 minute. Upon reaching the end of security row an Allegiant agent was waiting for us saying we can't board the door is closed and he can't open it. This was about 10 prior to departure. We walked out to our car and watched the plane parked at the jetway for 15 minutes more. Rebooked on next flight (3 days later). Arrived early. Everything went smoothly. Sat in plane till departure time. Door closed 1 minute before push back from jetway. Total cost for rebooking car rental rebooking baby gear rental rebooking $1250. Why did we re book with Allegiant? No competition at Plattsburg and our return flights already booked. Delta out of Montreal charges about $75 more return and free carry-on. Pretty much break-even and better schedule flexibility.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I am waiting for my flight to depart Rockford for St Petersburg as I write this complaint. Today is June 9 2014 and my bad experience with Allegiant started last Monday. We left our home near Orlando and drove to St Petersburg for our flight. We arrived early checked in and waited in the gate area. 10 minutes before we were to board we were told that there was a delay of 1.5 hours. Again about 10 minutes before we were to board we were told that the flight was cancelled. At this point we were sent to ticketing to receive hotel vouchers. After being given a voucher we were instructed to get our luggage and wait outside the baggage area for a shuttle to the hotel. No information as to which hotel we were being taken to or any representative from Allegiant to organize or supervise the process. To make issues worse when we arrived at the airport the next morning we checked in and went to the assigned gate. Once through security we found that the restaurant and gift shop were closed and there were no options to purchase any food or drinks and Allegiant did not provide anything for us. Then another delay evidently a flight attendant was running late which delayed the flight another 20 minutes. Overall the Allegiant staff were unresponsive and unprofessional. We were given $100 vouchers for a future flight however at this point I keep asking what good they really are. So forward one week and we are doing the same. Flight for 6pm is delayed to 9.05pm the delayed to 10.50pm so if I actually do depart tonight we are in the same situation we were last Monday. It is now too late to get a flight tonight to Orlando. I am amazed at the lack of professionalism I have encountered with Allegiant.

My original flight was scheduled to depart Fort Lauderdale FL on 6/8/14 at 1.45pm. The flight was delayed until 4.15. All of a sudden at 2.45 the entire flight was cancelled with no explanation. Allegiant would not help us with hotel arrangements transportation or meal vouchers. We were forced to pay for a taxi hotel and meals until the flight was rescheduled for the next day.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I flew last month from Chattanooga to St. Pete FL. The flight there and back was great. Plane arrived on time friendly attendants. Online check in was easy and simple it made waiting in line a breeze. I flew with my daughter and did not pay extra to get assigned seats. I was nervous that we would be split up but each time we were placed together. The flight attendant coming back seemed confused about what gate and plane we were actually going to board at first but she figured it out. The plane looked new and spacious. The seats did not recline back but were bearable since the flight was only an hour. The security guard at the airport was very helpful in giving instructions to my ride. Overall I received great service for great price. I plan to definitely fly with them again and will recommend to my friends and family.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My daughter flew from Phoenix to MLI delayed to the next day . My wife flew from MLI to Phoenix / delayed 1.5 hr. My wife and I flew from Phoenix to MLI delayed 3.5 hrs. The flight to Duluth Minn had been scheduled for earlier that morning but the passengers were load and then deplaned. At 2.30 we were moved from our gate and the Duluth passengers were move to our gate and were loaded on our plane. That took about 1.5 hr. Once loaded the Duluth passengers were then deplaned again and told their flight had been cancelled. After they had been deplaned we were moved back to the gate we were originally scheduled for and finally loaded. This was 3.5 hrs after we were scheduled to take off for MLI. Now not only are the Duluth passengers angry but so are the return passengers waiting in Duluth. On top of that the MLI passenger are mad and so are the return passenger waiting in Moline which was originally scheduled for 8.30-9.00pm that evening. Unfortunately this is our only direct flight to Phoenix but no one should have to put with this kind of incompetence.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Fly Allegiant at your own risk. Extremely poor customer service from 30-minute-plus hold times on the phone to surly check-in agents. Terrible baggage policy charging for each check bag and carry-ons this is the US equivalent of Ryanair. No beverage service - unless you pay for it. No snacks - again unless you pay for it. Surprised they don't charge to use the lav. We had flown Allegiant several times as it was the most convenient for airports on either end both by ourselves and a couple times with the grandkids but the last time in Mesa-Gateway with the snotty desk agent was the last straw. She was clearly having a bad day and was determined to take it out on the flying public. When she announced - quite loudly to everyone in line - that our one bag was 3 lbs overweight and had to be lightened or we'd be charged $75 my mind was made up. I lightened the heavier bag adding the weight to the other. We then asked for a gate pass for the grandkids dad so he could see them off she again loudly exclaimed no not unless there's a medical reason.

### Allegiant Air customer review
As the saying goes "You get what you pay for". Cheap flight was great. However do not purchase the shuttle from Allegiant directly as an add on. Book one yourself directly through a shuttle service. If you have any issues and try to call someone for help from Allegiant they will not assist you - they direct you to fill out an online form. And then the email response you receive will not even make sense. The service agent from the call center was rude to myself and the Resort Manager. They would not connect us to the customer service dept or their manager for help. Because of the horrible customer service that will be the last time I book anything through this company.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Left Sanford/Orlando May 5 2014 heading to South Bend IN at check in told clerk I never selected at seat when booking but was charged $48.00 for going and coming back she was very hateful and told me I was charged and had to sit in the seat I picked. I explained to clerk I could not sit in an aisle seat I always traveled with a window seat and she tells me "That's tough are you going to fly or not". I didn't get that so called assigned seat after all but it was an aisle seat due to a to switch of planes for some reason but still charge for the seat. I had things in my one piece of luggage that would not be returning with me coming home so luggage would be lighter - when checking back in to go home I was 4 pounds overweight with less things. When boarding I was told to sit in row 31 and not 25 and got a window seat this time but paid for another seat - the man sitting in my so called paid seat refused to move.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We have flown Allegiant 4 times now from Grand Forks ND to Sanford FL and have only had a delay once (our first time) due to a mechanical issue. The staff were very friendly and apologetic and after being delayed for 4 hours we actually arrived in Sanford in pretty good time. To people that are dissatisfied if there is a mechanical problem would you rather they discover it in mid-flight or would you rather have the delay? The money that we save with this airline is phenomenal and we will continue to use them as I think it is great value for the money.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew from to Niagara Falls to Sandford Florida and return. Both flights were somewhat on time (delayed a few mins leaving but arrived early at destination) and were smooth. Using the smaller airports is so much easier and more convenient.. All of the "extras" are subject to additional costs but on a 2 hour flight who really needs much more anyway. The flight down was aboard an old MD83 and the flight back was on a much newer Airbus A320. Good cheap non-stop flight and remember to read all the fine print and you will not be overcharged. Those complaining about "Surprise" charges did not read the disclaimers.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I constantly fly Allegiant round trips Sanford to Concord. Ever since they changed the times of this route from Monday and Friday morning to Mon/Fri evenings you can absolutely count on it being delayed 1 hour or more because it comes from Harrisburg PA. Please put back to Mon/Fri morning please.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Find another airline to fly with. Sure the price is cheap but if anything goes wrong Allegiant does not do anything to help or compensate you. Our flight was delayed multiple times leaving us sitting in the airport for over 6 hours. Then after 6 hours of waiting Allegiant cancelled the flight. We received no compensation. Further when we arrived at the airport the next day we sat on the runway for an hour waiting to disembark and then another hour for our bags to come to the carousel. After sending an email to Allegiant expressing my frustration with the experience they offered no compensation or credit just a generic email that I had to wait 2 months for. Paying a more money for another airline is definitely worth it!

### Allegiant Air customer review
After reading reviews I was nervous about my upcoming flight from South Bend to Mesa. However my experience was very positive. I was very pleased with all Allegiant employees I encountered. The flight attendants were very helpful and friendly and would go above-and-beyond to help a customer. The plane's cabin was very clean well- kept and fairly comfortable. I was concerned about leg room so I up-graded to an exit seat for the trip there. However I did not have that option on the return trip but did not need the extra room. I am 6'3" and had no issues with leg room or being comfortable. And yes there are no free snacks or drinks but their prices are extremely reasonable. I would rather pay a small amount for something I would like anyways. Overall I was very pleased with my experience and will fly Allegiant again. I hope Allegiant continues to expand to other airports and increase their routes.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We recently flew out of Bellingham to Las Vegas. The flight was on time crew were friendly I agree the seats are a bit uncomfortable but it's 2.5 hours so not a big issue. The only issue we had was on our return flight from Las Vegas we checked our bags at the airport at an outdoor kiosk and were told after our bags were taken that the fellows outside work on a tip only basis. We thought that was quite tacky and next time will check our bags at the counter inside. Overall though there were no issues worth mentioning and we would fly with them again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Having read some of the reviews I was a bit worried when I booked my flight to Honolulu. We left on April 25th on time. The Allegiant reps and flight attendants were very nice. The seats were a bit tight. They didn't give me free peanuts and drinks but since I saved nearly 800 dollars per person I could overlook that. The flight back was on time flight attendants were very nice people were on staff to check us in.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We had a great flight today. It was our first time flying with Allegiant and felt it was a bit of a gamble having read some poor reviews but our flight today between Clearwater and Harrisburg PA was perfect. From the check-in person to the pilots and flight attendants I truly noticed an attention to customer service I was not expecting. It was little things like just being friendly and talking to us like humans not robots that made the biggest impact. It made me feel so glad we chose to give Allegiant airline a chance and look forward to doing so much more in the future. We knew in advance we would be paying extra for luggage and for drinks etc. The rates were still the best and only non-stop available. And the fact that the seats did not recline back was considered a plus by me.

Flew round trip out of Fort Wayne to Phoenix. This was the only airline close by that was affordable for entire family to fly. The flight left early both times boarding started 45 minutes before departure time and we were on the runway 5 minutes prior to departure time and arrived earlier. I did pay for 5 seats and a checked bag and still came out ahead. The kids used backpacks and my husband and I each had a small bag that we put under our seats. They may have eyed our bags but never measured or asked any questions. The check in desk attendants and flight crew were all very nice. This trip definitely can compare to flying Delta. The plane was MD-80 very clean and comfortable. I will fly them again. I highly recommend being at the gate and checked in ready to go at least one hour prior to departure they board early and quickly!

I flew from Michigan to Phoenix in January. Our return flight was delayed multiple times and then cancelled with a rescheduled flight for the next day. That flight was also cancelled with no new flight schedule. We were forced to pay for another flight with a different airline. I would not recommend Allegiant unless you enjoy worrying your whole trip whether or not you will be able to return without booking another flight. In the end it cost me more to fly Allegiant.

We went from Greensboro to Sanford for a Spring Disney Trip. The staff was great from the check-in counter to landing. The flight attendants were very friendly. We had the same attendants on both flights and they remembered us and asked about our trip. The lady at check-in also told us that military doesn't have to pay for bags which saved me about $180. Overall great experience!

### Allegiant Air customer review
Bought ticket online in February also paying for seats and a checked bag. Later I added another bag and found on the itinerary that one seat was "not assigned". Tried to phone customer service but too long wait. On check-in at GRR I learned that the aircraft had changed thus deleting that seat. This got resolved by agent. But it caused me some confusion and time trying to resolve. Allegiant website not user friendly. I chose Allegiant because of convenience of departure and arrival airports and the times. But in general we were not impressed by the service. Don't know if we saved versus another airline. Will compare next time.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My husband and I fly with Allegiant very often but the past 4 or 5 times it has been delayed. I flew from Lexington to Orlando/Sanford on April 6 and the flight was delayed twice. The first time said it would be delayed by an hour and I thought ok I can deal with that. Then a couple hours later I received a text from Allegiant saying it was basically delayed by hours. Now keep in mind I paid more for a ticket to come in at an earlier time because my house is 2 hours away. We actually got in later than it I had paid for the cheaper ticket. I used to really like Allegiant but now I am wondering if I want to continue to fly with them or not. We usually fly at least 10 to 15 times a year.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flight was delayed each way. Rude service. The flight attendant literally told one lady not to take too long to put her bag away in the overhead. The flight is cheap but they add on charges for everything. I guess you get what you pay for.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Our second trip travelling with Allegiant and for the most part we are happy with our flights to first Hawaii and now San Diego. However travelling from San Diego on April 20 we were concerned with the lack of communication about gate location. Since we printed the boarding passes the night before we expected no firm boarding gate at that time. When we arrived at the airport without checked in baggage we went directly through security as we usually do. However past security on the airport monitors there was no reference to our flight at all. All other airlines had the gate and time of departure clearly listed. We walked the airports 40 plus gates looking for any indication of which gate we should depart from. We then asked airport staff and they could only suggest we find an Allegiant agent which we could not. Again all other airlines were clearly provided with gate and departure time but not Allegiant. Finally we called Allegiant customer service and were on hold for 30 minutes. The person we finally talked to was after some delay was able to provide a preliminary gate assignment but suggested it might change. When we finally did find it even the monitor at the gate indicated gate closed. Rather than relaxing before our flight the time past security was quite stressful and at time we wondered whether we were at the right terminal. Communication is very important to passengers. All it would likely taken was a quick call the airport staff to get the monitor situation corrected. We will fly Allegiant again.

Have flown many times with Allegiant and always expected some delays but never encountered one at all. Our fare from Orlando to Springfield MO was priced at $408 with Delta a 2 hour layover at Atlanta. We booked with Allegiant and paid just $110 round-trip and non stop. The aircraft was clean and flight attendants wonderful. I regularly travel from Orlando to Little Rock Springfield MO Newport News and Salisbury (now deleted) and thoroughly recommend Allegiant.

My wife and I were scheduled to fly out of Bellingham Wa to Las Vegas on April 11 for the 9 am flight. An hour before departure we were told it would not be leaving until 3.30pm with no explanation or apologies (apparently there was a mechanical problem). We were given $8.00 food vouchers each and waited further delay until 3.45. Once on the plane it left as scheduled. We returned on April 18 as scheduled. The crew were friendly and professional but won't fly with them again as the their aircraft is old and unreliable not worth the savings!

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flying out on Allegiant tomorrow and already this trip is a disaster. Confirmations have been difficult to receive went to check in online and wasn't able to add any bags. Went ahead and checked in to secure my seats and then called customer care. Told there was nothing more they could do. Told me that I would have to check my additional bags at the airport for a $50/bag charge vs. $20/bag online. She did offer to let me check my additional bags for my return trip but told me it was my tough luck on the outbound flight. She informed me however that I needed to be at the ticket counter 2 hours in advance and not the 60 minutes my e-mail confirmation said. Thankfully maybe I won't miss the flight but given all of the issues so far it will be the last trip for me on Allegiant. Pretty bad when you don't even have to take the trip to know that you won't be a returning customer.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We flew Toledo to Sanford Feb 6th. Since we were the only flight going out that morning we breezed through security. Boarded the plane and sat. Finally the captain came on and explained we had to wait for the fuel truck to come back because we had not received enough fuel. Then we sat waiting for the paperwork. We finally took off 45 min. late not making up any time in the air. When we approached Sanford the captain came on again to inform us we now had to much fuel and would be circling the airport until we burned it off. 45 mins later we landed. All this plane does is fly back and forth between Toledo and Sanford. You'd think the fuel people would know exactly how much fuel is needed for each trip.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I have been flying between Orlando-Concord for the last 10 weeks. Not once have they been on time. People at Orlando/Sanford are rude and inconsiderate. They view selling you a ticket as a favor. Last flight into Florida tonight and as usual they are late.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew round trip from Allentown to Orlando/Sanford. Was a little worried as I never herd of Allegiant before and that the planes are old but we had no problems and they were on time. I would use them again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Abysmal. We were notified a mere hour before our flight that it had been delayed a full 25 hours and procuring vouchers for our hotel was like pulling teeth. Additionally Allegiant refused to cover the taxi fare that we had accumulated as a result of their screw-up. Their representative said that it should be "good enough" for us that they were "accommodating [us] with a replacement flight! I spoke with a few travel representatives about this issue and they informed me that this sort of thing happens all the time with Allegiant.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Was supposed to fly from Belleville IL to Sanford Fl. The weather was horrible in STL area and there were tornado warnings issued. It took me 3 hours to get to airport which would usually take 1.5 hours. I tried to call the airline to report that it was dangerous for me to travel but I was on my way. There was a 30 minute wait to speak with a human. When I arrived at the airport the plane was still there but they said that they closed the door already and could not let me on. The plane pulled out ten minutes early. I was standing there watching the plane pull away from the jetway. No refund no sorry we left early and didn't let you on. nothing. I will never use this airline ever. Terrible customer service.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We flew Concord to Orlando and back with Allegiant and we loved it. We were careful to read all the rules about baggage etc before we got to the airport so we had no issues there. Yes you do have to pay for even a soda on the flight but it was not a big deal. The flight was comfortable the attendants were nice the flight was a little delayed but not by much and certainly no worse than any other airline. I really don't get all the complaints I have seen on other reviews. I really liked Allegiant!

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew St. Petersburg/Clearwater to Rockford IL. on April 5. Flight 876 was delayed 2 hrs due to five attendants calling in sick. Once boarded we waited another 2 hours before the maintenance check and paperwork were done. Very poor management and unacceptable for a flight service.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I have flown with Allegiant only twice round-trip from SGF to AZA. Both times we were always on time or even somewhat early. They deliver exactly what you pay for. From the ground crew to the air crew they are all professional and very pleasant. I only hope they continue to grow and look forward to using them more as they add destinations.

### Allegiant Air customer review
TUL to SFB flight and back after a weekend. The main motivation to use this airline was the affordable price and a direct flight to desired destination. We did our homework and were mostly pleased. This airline asks you to sacrifice comfort and charges less for it. If you demand extra they charge you extra. Have your boarding pass ready and be at the airport early. Print out your boarding pass as early as you can to get the best seats it is very important if you would like to sit with the person on the same reservation. Pack light. We just used the carry on allowed bag that has to fit under the seat. This also allows you to go straight to your gate. All check in bags and bigger carry on ones will be charged extra. The seats do not move but bring your own neck pillow. They allow a lunch pack and I had it with me so did not have to buy any food on the plane. Well I did buy a can of ice tea for $2. Bottle of water was also $2. Make sure you have an acceptable credit card for that. Restrooms are free! I did not like that the flights I took were both late. 30 and 45min. Not sure why. Seemed like that the first flight had been placed with the different plane (new airbus) since the seating arrangements were off and the second flight had some turbulent weather. Second plane was really old Douglas 80. Staff were nice and helpful. People do forget that this airline is different and demand the same service as on other airlines. Then they get frustrated if they get charged. I think I will fly again with them.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew yesterday with my family to Orlando for Spring Break and the flight was great when your on a budget this is the airline to choose. I read all the negative comments but every airline has delays. I fly for business at least once a week and I can't count how many times I have been delayed for numerous reasons. Direct flight was a big plus and Orlando/Sanford is an easy airport to get around in and you are out the door with your luggage in 20 minutes once you land. I will definitely use them again!

### Allegiant Air customer review
We flew from Las Vegas to Honolulu on March 27 2014. Flight to Honolulu had no problems or issues at all it was on time and everything went smoothly at the airport. Follow their luggage guidelines and check in online and you won't have any problems. Flight from Honolulu to Las Vegas was delayed 4 hours 15 minutes but they did give each person in my family $16 in food vouchers to use at the airport the problem was because of the delay we missed our shuttle from the Las Vegas airport to the parking garage where our car was. When I asked an Allegiant employee for some suggestions she just said I would have to get a taxi. When I checked in online 24 hours in advance for our flight home I was able to check everybody in except for myself (we had 10 people total). I tried to check myself in online a few hours later and it worked fine I just didn't get to sit by my family during the flight. There is no inflight movie so bring something to do. The seats are super small and there is not much room. No food or drink not even water is given unless you pay for it with visa only no cash. We got extremely affordable flights to Hawaii and otherwise would not have been able to go if it weren't for price Allegiant offered. You give up luxury and service for affordable pricing which I think is fair.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I recently traveled from Bangor to Punta Gorda. Upon check in you are asked to pay extra money to sit in preferred seats unimpressed considering these are 20+ year old aircraft not worth the money. Flight was delayed leaving Bangor due to an issues with the APU. Flight Attendants were uninformative rather sloppy looking the male purser became annoying by always telling people that he was from Hawaii and kept making rude comments about other passengers hardly professional. Landed late into Punta Gorda no apology for the delay just more lip from that annoying purser surprised he didn't break out into another Hawaiian song just so annoy us. Will never take this awful carrier again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Plane was supposed to leave Bellingham for Vegas at 9am and arrive at 11am. Mechanical problem's delayed flight until 12pm. At 12pm we were told our plane was flying to San Diego. This caused an uproar. We were told a plane was coming to get us at noon it didn't show up until 9.30pm. We arrived in Vegas at 1.30am Friday. A completely wasted day. Staff were not available for question's while we waited for hours. Allegiant's price for flying is the only bonus. Their entire staff are rude and don't seem to have a clue about how to treat a customer.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew to Bloomington IL to Sanford FL and likely wont use them again. Paid for carry-on carefully measured bags but made the mistake of stopping at the ticket counter where they said my bag didn't easily fit into the measurement device. Paid $50 extra for checked bag. Others who did not stop at ticket counter had much larger bags and were allowed to carry-on. No complimentary beverages - really? Return trip-although we paid for assigned seats our boarding pass did not have them spent couple hours night before to get them re-assigned only to be told upon boarding that we had to find our own seats - no apology - just "you will be reimbursed". We got differing information from every employee we spoke with regarding: extra baggage fees seating assignments how to indicate a lap child etc. Tried to use the Allegiant iPhone app which crashed and would not open. Signed up for text message regarding flights - never got a single one. Boarded almost an hour pre-flight and then sat in the plane without moving for over an hour - no explanation for the delay.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I fly Bangor to Punta Gorda or Tampa/St Pete a lot. For what I save in cost I can't complain. However my attitude is that I am simply paying to get from point A to point B safely and on time - and at minimal cost. That always happens. I've had delayed flights on every airline I've ever flown - except Allegiant. That's simply a coincidence and it will surely happen eventually. It seems people can't wait to post bad news never the good. Allegiant specializes in low cost flights so don't compare them to airlines that hype about making your flight the highlight of your vacation. If you want to pay (a lot) extra for all the luxuries that's your choice - don't fly Allegiant.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew from Orlando to Lexington Ky on March 29 2014. Numerous problems from weather delay (understandable) to plane mechanical problems. All the time this was happening there was very little or no communication from the attendants. We were like wandering sheep trying to figure out where to go and what to do. Obviously little or no direction from management as to what to do when problems arise. I will never fly Allegiant again and urge others to consider the same. Flight scheduled to leave at 1.05pm finally left at 7.30pm. Pitiful.

My grandson was to leave from Punta Gorda at 4.30 to fly to Fort Wayne Indiana and was delayed two times. Finally left at 8.30 pm. My niece just left today from Punta Gorda to also fly to Fort Wayne Indiana and was delayed 4 hours also. My sister is to fly from Fort Wayne to Punta Gorda tonight March 29 2014 and has been delayed four hours also. This is outrageous and I may never use Allegiant Air again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We were set to fly out of Mesa at 6.45am. Did online check in the night before got in line to check bag at 5.55. After 20 minutes in line we got to the counter checked the bag and the woman said we were too late and would not make our flight! No last call from counter no indication of a problem and this is a very small airport! So we took our bag shot through security and they paged us over the intercom to get to the gate. We got to the gate at 6.25 20 minutes before take off time. We could see the plane there were approx 25 people still going up the steps and boarding. There was no agent at the gate we could not get out there! I ran to the next gate explained and asked her to let us out. She said no one was allowed out inside of the 20 minute deadline. At this point we were 17 mins out. In the end we stood there watching people board they plane take off and we were stuck! When I got back to the ticket desk the woman smiled and said the next flight to my town was in 2 weeks as all others were booked! We had to spend an additional $150 to catch a flight back 7 hours later to a city 2 hours from where we left our car! When we boarded this flight it was delayed because they were waiting for a passenger! She boarded at 1.55 for a flight set to leave at 2.05! We were furious.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Bellingham to Las Vegas round trip. Surprisingly the trip to KLAS was really smooth. Our personal item was a bit big width-wise but we got through no problem. Our plane arrived few minutes early the staff were professional and humorous (not expecting that) and the seats weren't that bad. The flight was really smooth. The trip back to KBLI was delayed by an hour because the incoming flight from Bellingham was delayed by the rain and even though the plane was parked in the gate both pilots were on the incoming flight. We made up some time because of strong tailwind (the pilots were trying hard to arrive a few minutes earlier). The pilots landed in the wind smoothly. The only thing I dislike about this airline is that you have to pay to select a seat even upon check-in. When you look at the price tag ($400 for 2 ppl round trip) all those pay drinks could be forgiven even the expensive carry-on. I think that you see all those negative reviews because people who had positive experience took it for granted (though really those delays are horrible to hear). I will travel with Allegiant again and hopefully Allegiant will train more professional crews.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew from Clearwater St. Pete to Grand Rapids MI. Many people on the flight paid extra for reserved seating and had to sit where there were seats left. They said over the loud speaker that the seating was basically screwed up people who were assigned seat b were supposed to sit on seat c and so on and so on. The flight attendants were not really any help at all. In fact one of them seemed very irritated with the passengers that were complaining that they had paid extra for reserved seating. There were several boarding passes that had duplicate seating. Some passengers gave up their seats so families could sit together. After we boarded the plane we backed out from the gate and sat on the tarmac for 50 minutes before we took off. No explanation. Oh but they gave us free bottles of water and a mini pretzel bag. I guess that was supposed to make up for it.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Months ago I purchased a flight from Allegiant for this morning checked in for my flight online last night and loaded the boarding pass on my phone with Allegiant's app. I had no bags to check so I was ready to go. When I got to the security check point the app crashed and as it died it took my boarding pass with it. OK. I went to the Allegiant ticketing counter told them the app crashed and even after I connected to wi-fi it would try to "reload" but failed every time and that I needed a boarding pass. They said that it was impossible that boarding had started and no agent computer or app could produce a boarding pass now. 30 minutes before my flight was supposed to leave they started paging my name. This was a small airport TSA had no line the gate was around the corner. I could see the person paging my name. Unless your travel is strictly leisure and it doesn't matter at all if you get to your destination not avoid Allegiant like a plague. Cheap is nice until cheap fails.

We were supposed to leave Bismarck ND on Sunday March 23rd at 12.50 pm. We were all loaded and sat at the terminal for 15 minutes when the captain came on and said we would not be going to Las Vegas in this plane. They would try to fix this one or send another from Las Vegas. Two hours later told us this flight had been cancelled. Nobody with Allegiant would talk or offer any explanation. They offered a phone number that said to go to the website. That's it. After finally getting the info from the website it says we will leave the next day after another Allegiant flight. We should be leaving before that flight.

I booked a flight on January 3 2014 to fly from Orlando to Newport News on March 24. On March 18 I received an email that all flights to Newport news were cancelled for the month of March. I was left scrambling to book a new ticket on another airline. No help from Allegiant customer service booking at short notice on another airline was expensive. No explanations for the cancellation and no concern for my situation. The flight was to my daughter's wedding. I have never had an experience where you booked a ticket and the airline cancelled without offering options to get you to your destination.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew from Niagara Falls to Sanford. Flights were on-time. No frills airlines but additional charges were excessive. Normal checked baggage with other airlines is 50lbs. With these guys its 40lbs. Had to pay additional $150 for overages. Convenience has a price tag other than that I would fly with someone else.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We flew the Charlotte to Orlando route and had a great experience both ways. The flights were a little delayed but no worse than any other airline and one delay was truly weather related. You do have to pay for every bag soda and snack on the flight but the flight was literally 1/3 the price of other airlines so I didn't mind spending $13 for a bag or $3 for a soda. Flight attendants were nice flight was comfortable...no complaints here.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew back from Las Vegas to Grand Forks ND. Flight # 484 March 15th. If you want your holiday plans ruined then fly Allegiant. Their planes are overused and mechanical failures are often and cause delays each time that I flew. When you check in they treat you with disrespect. They charge you extra for service that is non-existent and you sit cramped in tiny seats with no circulation to your legs. Staff are very rude and have no people skills. Be prepared to pay extra for carrying a small tote handbag on board.

PSI-BLI flight 211 16th March. Late 50% of the time. Fly 40+yr old DC10's. Online info wrong and outdated. Nickled and dimed to death - almost the same cost as a decent airline especially when factoring in car travel. You pay for what you get - will never fly with them again!

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flight from Bloomington IL to Orlando-Sanford FL on 3/13/14. Walked up to the check-in counter line 50 minutes prior to our flight. The man in front of us had been given a card that said he was going to be the last person to check-in and the Allegiant representative yelled at me and my 2 daughters across the crowd of 30 people to say "You missed your flight. She ended up letting us check in without even trying to carry on our bags (which were all within the size limits!) charging us $50 each and when we went to board no one else had boarded yet either. She eventually came to the boarding counter with the other representatives and made a comment to me that it must have been my "lucky day. It was embarrassing and stressful and I will never fly with Allegiant again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
This is probably my seventh or eighth round-trip between Greensboro and St. Pete. Like all the other flights I was very pleased with Allegiant. Their flight crews are quite professional yet very friendly the planes are new and are usually quite clean. Both flights this time were either on time or just a few minutes late. Yes you pay for everything. But I find that everything is explained on their website. I will continue to fly with Allegiant in the future.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We flew from Syracuse to Clearwater and after reading all the bad reviews we were very nervous as to what to expect. We flew with 3 small children during the March Break too. The customer service on both ends was excellent the staff were very friendly and accommodating with our children. The check-in line was quick and efficient on both ends. Our flight was delayed on the way down for an hour but once the plane arrived we quickly boarded and were up and away. Complimentary water and pretzels were given and the flight was smooth and quick. I would totally fly this airline again and as a family of 5 discount rates during the March Break a non-stop flight and small lineups beat a larger airline with more frills any day!

### Allegiant Air customer review
Unexplained major delays from KDSM to KDPG. Agents tell different accounts for delays. No consistency. The delays are apparently occurring in Punta Gorda as they are the planes that make the return trip to Florida arriving at midnight 1-2am well after the advertised ETA of 10pm. If you can't make routes work consistently then get out of the market!

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew to St. Pete's from Bangor (return) - no issues on the flight there. Flight home was delayed 1 hour which was not a big deal. Complimentary water and pretzels provided due to the delay. Staff were friendly and things were kept very simple. Liked the fact that it was a direct flight and the price was considerably lower than other airlines.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Got to airport 2.5 hours before scheduled flight. Waited to board only to be offered a "complimentary drink" (soda or water) while we waited for a mechanical issue to be resolved. 1.5 hours after our flight was supposed to leave we were told it was canceled with no explanation or apology. They have no agreement with another airline to assist when this kind of thing happens. We were "put up in a hotel" by the airline because we lived more than 50 miles from the airport. We were told to check online for when our flight would be rescheduled. Our "new" flight was scheduled 30 hours later. On our return flight we were not "allowed" to check our bags until two hours before the flight. That time came and went and multiple flights by Allegiant were canceled or delayed while we stood in line. When we were finally allowed to check our bags less than 1 hour before our flight.

### Allegiant Air customer review
As a frequent traveler flying every 7 to 10 days I will never purchase a flight on this airline again. At best on time flights record is 50/50. Customer service is the worst I have seen. No information to passengers that might allow for alternate travel plans no concern for elderly or families with children no consideration of food or beverage needs with 5+ hour delays many delayed flights arriving after midnight with no rental car service plus many other complaints including a ridiculous customer service phone line with up to two hour waits for a representative who is not empowered to provide even a small amount of customer service. Many more issues. Strongly advise not risking travel plans with this airline. With all this said actual flight crews have been very nice and professional.

### Allegiant Air customer review
March 3 from Bellingham to Palm Springs with my 87 year old mother. Flight was originally set to 3.45 delayed to 7.45 then moved ahead to 6.45. People were scrambling to get to the airport for the 6.45 departure. Ended up waiting in the waiting room for the crew to arrive. They showed up for the 7.45 flight. We didn't board the plane for another hour. Then sat on the tarmac for 45 minutes while they re-booted the system twice. Finally towed back to the gate and boarded another Allegiant jet that had been sitting there all the time. By the time we arrived in Palm Springs around 1.00am the car rental counter was closed. The night before our return flight on March 7 we were text to say the flight on Friday was delayed back to Bellingham. By this time I had been trying to get hold of Allegiant on the customer service # - the waits on my cell phone were over 30 minutes. We did not want to risk dragging our mother all over the airport having the flight delayed again or worse cancelled and having to figure out what to do! I finally got hold of Allegiant and cancelled our return flight. We got one-way tickets on Alaska to Seattle and had one of the husbands pick us up and drive us back to Bellingham. Another long day but at least Alaska was on time and answered the phone.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flight 966 from Punta Gorda to Peoria IL. Ft. Myers area experienced storms for about 1.5 hrs in the morning. Our flight was scheduled at 3.30pm. All flights prior to us were delayed when we checked in. Approx 30 min prior to departure I received about 3 texts delaying flight hour by hour until 9.45. Then the gate agent announced that due to shuffling of aircraft our flight was delayed until midnight. They announced we could leave airport and return later. I never did receive a text about the last delay and the website never reflected this either. In the meantime every flight scheduled after us departed either delayed slightly or on time. We then found out Allegiant hired a Sun Country flight to pick up passengers first in PIA and bring them to Punta Gorda and then take us home. This flight arrived at 12.00 am. We were then held off from boarding for another 1 hour as we waited for them to deplane 3 more flights that had arrived shortly after our plane. We in finally took off at 1.45 am. Paid for seat and because aircraft was different it was changed to open seating. Staff ordered pizza for everyone and provided soft drinks and water. I can understand delays like this if weather is bad. Difficult to watch several flights fly out that were scheduled after us. Very true you get what you pay for.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Las Vegas NV to Grand Forks ND I arrived at the terminal 2 hours before my flight was scheduled to depart. I had checked in online prior to arriving at the airport so that all I would have to do was drop my bags. I was herded into a pen with hundreds of other Allegiant travelers and subjected to an Allegiant Airline agent who took great joy in yelling at everyone to check-in online so that they could be fast-tracked to a different holding pen. Many of us tried to explain that we had already done so prior to arriving at the airport - but it was to no avail. Eventually (25 mins later) we were divided into two lines. One for those of us who had checked in online and one for travelers who had not. Standing in this new line the same agent began yelling for travelers who were supposed to be going to various destinations - supposedly in order of departure time. Those travelers were fast- tracked to the front of the online check-in line regardless of whether they had actually checked-in online or not. Even though some of those travelers were "fast-tracked" - many missed their flights. I ended up playing dumb and getting in line with some people who were leaving on a flight that was scheduled to depart before mine - just so that I would not miss my flight too. When I got to the counter the agent I dealt with lectured me for being late and wrote "late" all over my boarding pass and bag tag. I ran to security and then on to my gate just to make it in time. I have no idea how many missed the flight. Next time I fly - I will be looking at all other airline options before I even consider Allegiant.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Scheduled to fly Bellingham to Honolulu (7pm) on Feb 17 2014 and sat in the departure gate and listened to a few delay messages before the staff member at the gate desk vanished. An hour later I went searching for an Allegiant rep to update us. Then told the flight was cancelled - rumour had it that the flight crew did not have sufficient hours to complete the journey. This stranded a full plane load of passengers. I can understand and support the safety reasons that support the crew not flying but I think this indicates very poor management. We were provided hotel accommodation and flew out the next day at 12 noon. We and many others lost the prepaid hotel payments for the night of the 17th we did not show.

### Allegiant Air customer review
March 3 scheduled flight from Palm Springs to Belingham. The rescheduled flight departed as advertised on March 4 and landed on time. Some apologies from airline staff about previous day's snafu but no explanations tendered. On arrival at Bellingham I learned from other sources that there had been many cancellations due to ground fog and poor visibility at Bellngham airport. If this was indeed the reason for Allegiant's problems the previous day they never mentioned it. Returning March 6 from Bellingham online check-in didn't work for me forced to wait in line for nearly an hour to get boarding pass. Actual flight left and arrived on time no untoward events. If Allegiant was more forthcoming keeping its clients properly informed of what was happening they could save a lot of the ill will and frustration they engender among their clients when things go wrong. My previous recommendation stands: if you want cheap fares and time is not pressing they're ok otherwise choose a more expensive and hopefully more customer-friendly airline such as WestJet.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Scheduled on 2/17/14 to fly from Newport News to Orlando/Sanford at 5.46pm. At 4pm we received a message the flight was delayed followed by information it was on time for departure. Checked in and then notified it was delayed an hour. We then had 3 more delays and by 11pm we were ready for boarding. It got worse from there as the flight crew walked off the job. They had to piece a crew together for the flight to Newport News. So we then boarded the aircraft they announced we needed to hurry up or they would not fly. This was just frustrating by this point seemed rude way to approach the situation when they were at fault for the longer then expected delays. 7 days later we were set to return at Orlando/Sanford it was really disorganised at check in and you could only check in when they announced they would allow you to do so. Last but not least we were able to check in we had 1.5 hours until departure and decided to have lunch. Then we got notification our flight was delayed. After a 2 hour delay we boarded and the pilot apologized for the delay. Sometimes you pay for what you get and don't understand how they are still in business. Poor communication rude from my experience and how they treated other customers.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I was involved in the debacle that was at the Bellingham Airport the week of Feb 23rd due to the snow. Allegiant has poor communication terrible customer service hold times of 2 hours or more when calling on the phone flight text alerts do not work to tell you that the flight is delayed/canceled. Flights still said on-time when checking online even though they were delayed or canceled once you got to the airport and were waiting in the terminal. They will not pay for hotel accommodation. Spent a total of 18 hours waiting at the airport in regards to the departing flight as well as the flight back to Bellingham. The funny thing was the whole time Allegiant was scrambling around trying to figure out what they were going to do Alaska Airlines flights were all having no problems landing and getting off the ground. This is by far the worst travel experience I have ever had.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flight 729 Little Rock to Orlando March 2 2014. We arrive at the airport early to find out that our flight is delayed. No one can give us any answers on the status of our flight. Our original flight was suppose to depart at 5.50pm we were finally able to board at 10pm. Once we boarded the plane they made us wait while they de-iced the plane. After 45 mins we push back from the gate to be de-iced. We wait another 30 mins for the de-ice truck. After a 2 or more hour wait we are brought back to the gate to de-plane. This takes another 30 mins or more before the her bridge is even brought to our plane. Once off the plane all they tell us is sorry be back tomorrow morning at 10am our flight is scheduled to depart at noon. They do not tell us which baggage claim our bags will be located we just have to wonder around baggage claim until we find it. This is another long wait. The next morning we are notified that our flight is delayed from departing at noon to now at 4.30pm. We have now lost 2 of our vacation days money spent on hotels and money on rental cars. You may pay more with other airlines but you will have a better chance making it to your final destination.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I flew last month and the experience was not pleasant. The flight from St. Petersburg/Clearwater FL to Greenville SC was scheduled to leave at 9am. The evening prior to our departure we received an electronic communication of the flight being delayed to 1pm. I was appreciative of the communication until I showed up to the airport only to find that the flight was delayed again until 3.30. This time I received no communication and the board at the airport as well as their website still showed a 1.00 departure time. As if that wasn't enough after paying for a seat assignment they could not honor it due to using a different plane. So it became open seating. Unfortunately it appears from their rude demeanour the ground staff do not care about their customers. The only bright spot was the flight crew! They were very good to passengers! All in all I may have to fly from a different airport in the future which is sad because I frequent this area and prefer the regional airport but if Allegiant cannot be more dependable then I will fly an airline that cares about my business.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Fly from MDT to Orlando/Sanford. Check in was a little rough due to no one delegating which line was the line for people who already checked in vs people just arriving and not checked in ahead of time. Flight left on time. Seats weren't anything special but it's an airplane not your living room sofa. Flight attendants were helpful and nice. The airline is a discount airline so you're going to get charge for the "frills". You get a discounted ticket but you're going to end up paying for the extra stuff right down to the seating and bags. Our flight back to MDT was delayed 2 hours but the weather was bad that day with snow up North and thunderstorms down South. Not much anyone could do with that setback. All in all I'd use them again and even suggest it to people I know could handle it.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Feb 28 return Mar 3 2014 Springfield MO to Clearwater/St Petersburg FL. Outward leg on an Allegiant A320. Brand new seats but seats very uncomfortable and small seat pitch. Very small tray table not even large enough to hold a laptop and a beverage at the same time. These seats are perhaps the worse seats I have encountered. Slight delay due to computer errors pilots had to reboot the computers. Three delayed flights arrived same time in St Petersburg and our luggage did not arrive in the terminal for an hour and 20 minutes. Return on Miami Air International- sub contracting for Allegiant. 737-800 aircraft better seats and room plus given bottled water pretzels and cookies. No issues on return flight.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Booked to fly PSP-BLI Mar 3 on flight 211 leaving 7.12 arriving 10pm. Received recorded phone call and email that morning that there would be 4 hour delay flight would now arrive at 2 am. Later same day received further phone / email that departure time changed to 10.15 from previous 11.15pm. On arriving at waiting lounge at 9.15pm found departure now back to 11.15. Eventually announcement about cancellation made over PA system. Two harassed and overworked employees dealt reasonably well in the circumstances explaining about replacement flight next day and providing overnight accommodation to those who needed it. I have frequently travelled Allegiant in the past but have suffered two very bad delays so far in 2014. Their planes are old and possibly more subject to mechanical defects their spare planes and aircrews are few ground support staff are seldom to be seen and apparently not well informed on operational problems. Allegiant's prices are cheap if you are traveling light and prepared to put up with frequent and lengthy delays but if dependable service is what you want pay up and go elsewhere.

### Allegiant Air customer review
March 4 2014 - we returned from trip to Las Vegas on Allegiant it was a 2 day delay going down and a 5 hour delay on the return. I have never had such bad service. Do not be fooled by the cheap prices they don't care about the passengers and are only there for the money. Our vacation was ruined as we lost 2 days of our trip. When we finally got on board after waiting over 40 hours they would not even pay for our drinks.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We travelled to Punta Gorda Fl. on Feb 10th and returned Feb 28th. Both flight were on Miami Air and went smoothly we were given complimentary pretzels and water both ways. Allegiant and Miami staff were friendly and helpful the seats on the 737 had plenty of leg room.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew back from Mesa on one of their newer larger planes. The seats were the most crowded and most uncomfortable I have endured! In theory Allegiant is convenient and affordable but the reality is that they nickle and dime you to death miss scheduled times on a regular basis and now abuse and insult their passengers with terrible seating!

### Allegiant Air customer review
Allegiant is a budget airline and the old saying that you get what you pay for applies. We were delayed 2 days and they made us sit in the airport for hours before finally cancelling and only send an email to tell you the rescheduling time. They also don't tell you that email is how you will be notified. The flight attendants chew gum when serving people which looks highly unprofessional. When you try to call to rebook you can expect a long hold. I found some of the agents to be very helpful and others not. It would have to be a pretty huge saving for me to pick this airline again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew this airline for the first time Feb 13th from Clearwater FL. Flight was delayed 1 hour and we were notified the night before. The flight coming home was a different experience. Flight was delayed 3 hours got the notification 2 hours after the first delay we had to be at the airport at 6am for original flight. The airline had to change their aircraft due to mechanical difficulty. My daughter is flying to SC in March because she is in a wedding the following day already got notification her flight is delay 5 hours can't take the chance for anymore delays.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My wife and I were supposed to fly from Asheville NC to Fort Lauderdale on Feb 14 for our first cruise which was to leave on the 15th. Allegiant delayed the flight until 8.30pm then cancelled the flight. The next flight was rescheduled for Saturday 16th February one day after our ship left port! We had to drive our car 12 hours to Fort Lauderdale to make our cruise which we did! Our drive back was uneventful allowed us to overnight in Savannah GA thank goodness because the return flight to Asheville was delayed we made it back home before the plane did! Fly Allegiant at your own risk.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My husband and I travelled to Florida from Bangor recently on an Allegiant flight. Staff friendly and everything else was very satisfactory. We were leaving in poor weather so the plane had to be de-iced. That meant our departure was delayed for one hour. When we compared the cost of flights from other departure points and with other airlines there was no comparison for value for money. And the fact that the trip was non-stop was a real bonus. We would definitely fly Allegiant again!

### Allegiant Air customer review
Since this is the only airline that flies from Harrisburg PA (MDT) to Clearwater/St Pete I am stuck flying with them. I have flown many times with Allegiant and not once have they been on time. The least amount of time that the flight was delayed 3 hours. I have learned my lesson with Allegiant. Expect nothing. Rude service extremely long check-in lines horrible seats nothing not even a bottle of water is free. I am actually scheduled to fly today. Flight 803 10.47am. I have now been advised the flight is leaving at 5.03pm.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flight 645 to Sanford FL 4 hours late. Crew" issues apparently. Got in so late that the Avis counter was about to close after waiting for us well beyond their closing time. Flight 644 back home. Another 3 hours late. Heard crew and/or weather related issue. First and last time I fly this mess of an airline. I was excited that they offered an inexpensive direct flight to Florida. Now I know why. Talking with others in the terminal (customers as well as non-Allegiant terminal staff) I learned this is the norm for them. If you value your vacation avoid at all costs especially if you have something time sensitive waiting for you on the other end.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We flew from Bellingham to Palm Springs over the Christmas holidays. It snowed the day we were leaving we made it to the airport okay for the morning flight and waited for them to clear the runway. Allegiant kept delaying all day and in the end cancelled the flight. We had to spend almost 2 hours on the phone waiting for customer service to book us on a flight the next day which left in the afternoon. Again delayed over an hour and so we lost two days of our vacation. On the way back from Palm Springs we were delayed a couple of hours as well. The line to check in was ridiculous. Every other airline has multiple agents and no line-up.. Allegiant one or two agents and over an hour line-up (both ways). On the way down we were a couple of lbs. over the limit with the check-in luggage and they said no problem. On the way back they said even if you're 1 lb. over you have to take something out or they'd charge us. This is the one and only time I will ever fly with them.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Holiday trip a real bust on Allegiant Air. Our departure was delayed two hours from Youngstown to Punta Gorda. The snack bar and restaurant at the airport were closed. When the flight finally departed there were no snacks or food left on the aircraft due to the lateness and not taking the opportunity to restock. The seating is uncomfortable. I'm 6'3" and my knees were banging on the seat ahead of me the entire flight. The seatbacks do not recline so you are stuck in a stiff upright posture the entire flight. It's like riding in a cattle car. I will not fly this airline again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
This is without a doubt the worst airline I have been on. The aircraft was filthy the flight attendants surly and rude and the service awful. The aircraft took off from Las Vegas bound for Bellingham without an adequate fuel load and we had to land in Portland to refuel. I will never fly this airline again and encourage others not to as well. I would rather pay twice the fare that Allegiant charges and have a pleasant flight feel safe and not have to tolerate rude and surly flight attendants.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Recently flew out of PIE. Surprisingly we left on time even arrived early. Even though they said we had a tailwind behind us I think it was more like less planes traveling that day because of a snowstorm. I had the time for this flight and was actually prepared for their tardiness and was pleased to be on time for once! Would recommend because of price but be prepared to be late.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We were scheduled to leave Grand Forks to Sanford Orlando on January 27th. We had a storm to drive through and highways were closed. We managed to reach the airport with little sleep and were boarded on our plane at 10.30am. We were onboard but were then taken off the plane due to a flat tyre. They told us they would try to fix the issue and then we were told that we were going to fly out that day. After waiting at the airport until 3.30pm they told us the flight was cancelled until the next day. They put us up in a hotel but only one room per booking. We were told we would leave at 8am then got bumped to 8.30am! Not impressed! Not sure if I would fly with them again.

Orlando/Sanford to Belleville Il. Feb 9. I have 2 million plus miles on the 3 major carriers and flew Allegiant Air for the first time last Sunday. I was pleasantly surprised by my experience. Flight was a few minutes late but with the snow that was fine. The crew was great and I enjoyed my conversation with the flight attendants. I have no issue with pay-as you go. I will fly them again!

My wife and I flew with them in November out of Grand Rapids Michigan for the first time it was the worst experience I've ever had. The 2 staff members behind the desk at check in claimed to be travel agents were also were rude and angry! Our flight was cancelled no one was at the gate to provide any information we ended up missing our cruise. On our way home our flight was cancelled 8-10 hours and airline offered $50 voucher.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My son traveled to Honolulu in January to see his girlfriend. He is a college student so budget is key. The flight home was delayed 7 hours then cancelled until the next day. When he arrived at the airport in plenty of time there was no-one at the desk. He didn't have a boarding pass because there wasn't an option to print it for that flight. The airport customer service called the gate and told them a passenger was waiting - they said they would come and get him. No-one came - he missed his flight. To top if off the next flight out was 2 days later. I was told by the central office that they do not have a reciprocal arrangement with other airlines and there was "nothing they could do". The low prices may be appealing but in the end you end up paying more. Good discount airlines are a great alternative but Allegiant Air has missed the mark.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Due to locations served I have flown Allegiant multiple times. Flights have been routinely delayed by hours or rescheduled to the next day. I couldn't believe they flew in and out of Asheville NC on the morning of Feb 13 in the middle of winter storm PAX. Both Delta and US Airways had cancelled their flights. I couldn't get to the airport to catch my flight. One of the few times Allegiant flew on time.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Over the last 6 years I have flown Allegiant 39 times - all PIE to FWA. with few exceptions I would rate them as good to very good however in the last 2 months (Dec 2013 - Jan 2014) the service has been deplorable! The last 3 flights I've taken with them have followed a similar pattern: 2 4 6 hour delays then cancel and re-book the next day. My sense is that they've grown too fast and their infrastructure can't keep up with their flights but it ultimately comes down to poor management. It's too bad - this was an excellent convenient flight. I'm now forced to look at other options.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Feb 2nd 2014. Had a flight at 12 out of SYR got the 1 and only email saying the flight was delayed until 1.45. I get to the airport at 1 to have them tell me the plane hasn't left PIE (Clearwater) yet. We then didn't board until 4.45 sat on the plane until 5.30 until we finally took off. They served us 1 slice of cold pizza. We finally touched down at 8.30. I have a return ticket for this Thursday I purchased a ticket to fly United instead. Staff not friendly either. I will not fly Allegiant again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Don't fly Allegiant day after Super Bowl two crews flying out of Phoenix Mesa failed to show up resulting in significant delays. AZA to GTF delayed at least 4 hours and counting. Weather fine at both ends of flight. Obviously no backup crews. Communication of delays is poor. Flights are inexpensive but airline may be operating over it's head. Could be an airline with a bright future if it can sort out it's operational issues. They did offer refreshments and food voucher after 2 hours of waiting.

### Allegiant Air customer review
If you believe the prices are too good to be true thats because they are! The last time I flew with them I was stuck in Punta Gorda for over 8 hours at the airport. They said the plane had a malfunction and that they had sent for another plane. The other plane never showed and they finally fixed the plane we were supposed to travel on almost 9 hours later. Today I was supposed to fly from Asheville to Punta Gorda. I received 5 different text messages delaying the flight hour by hour. Finally when I did not receive a text and the plane was supposed to leave at 2.20 I went to the airport only to find out that the plane that was supposed to pick us up had not even left Punta Gorda yet due to "cloud coverage". Allegiant did not notify any passengers of this until they all arrived at the airport thinking the flight was finally on time. After about an hour I received a text stating that the flight was cancelled but with no time or information on when or if it would be rescheduled. I would much rather pay the extra money to travel with an airline you can trust.

Flight 813 from Roanoke to St. Petersburg on 1/26/14. Return Flight 812 on 1/30/14. My husband and I flew down to Florida from Roanoke VA last week. It was perhaps the best airline experience I have had in decades. The reservation process was excellent with the site being easy to navigate and all details being clearly explained. We paid for pre-assigned seats and for one carry-on each. We printed out our boarding passes prior to arriving at the airport and everything was a breeze. We had early arrivals and the flight was comfortable. I will definitely travel through Allegiant Air in the future when going to Florida.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I have been at the airport since 6.45am. There are roughly 6 planes worth of people stuffed into an airport meant to hold 2 planes worth. There are no restaurants just a snack shop in the corner that ran out of sandwiches 2 hours ago they do serve alcohol which isn't really making it's patrons calmer. All of the chairs are full and people are occupying the floor and every standing and leaning space. I believe there is only one bathroom but if I get up to investigate I might lose my seat. The only information booth with actual people is located outside of security so we are all essentially trapped in the terminal. Details are being delivered through an intercom system run by unapologetic staff. They assure us there is no new information and that our planes are unable to land at the airport because of cloud cover or leave their prior destinations because of rain.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Round trip from Spokane WA to Honolulu HI was late 3+ hours each way. All delays were caused by Allegiant. This caused delays for our anniversary trip and generated over $400 of additional costs. Even though all delays were incurred by Allegiant they offered no complimentary services. Will never fly this airline again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Have flown Allegiant about 12 times and have had only 1 on time departure. Our last flight was 1/26 from PIE to AVL. Over 5 hours late. Equipment issues. Worst part is that even though it had an Allegiant flight # it was flown by Falcon Air. Both plane and crew were Falcon. When we checked in we were told that it was a chartered flight.

I recently flew from Niagara Falls NY airport down to Florida for a week. The plane we had was an older one no entertainment washroom could have been renovated. I felt this crew were not as professional as others I've observed. No coffee tea or water glad I had brought my own. We were a little late taking off because of de- icing. Upon coming back I was only a few lbs over with my luggage but got charged 50 dollars. There are too much add-ons for this airline. Overall this was the worst experience on a trip I've had.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We had a direct flight from Bangor to Punta Gorda on 1/29/14. Flight was on time until we entered the aircraft then told that our direct flight would be diverted to Allentown PA to refuel. Finally left Allentown and told it would be 3 hours to Punta Gorda. 4 hours later we were descending into Punta Gorda almost ready to land and the plane suddenly started climbing again 1 hour later we were told that it was too foggy to land at Punta Gorda and we didn't have enough fuel to hang around and wait for it to clear so were going to land in St Petersburg. After landing was on the tarmac another hour waiting to get to a gate. 6 busses and 3 hours later we were taken back to Punta Gorda.

My sister in law was on a direct flight from Bangor ME to Punta Gorda FL. Instead of a direct flight they had to stop in Allentown PA. Then headed down to Punta Gorda FL. which original was suppose to land at 4.30 pm but because of the stop in Allentown PA. they changed it to 6pm. When they got to Punta Gorda FL. they wouldn't land and flew up to St. Pete FL. Finally put them on buses and bussed them back to Punta Gorda FL. They were not told what was going on and had no food or drinks and were made to stay on the plane. Arriving in Punta Gorda FL. at 11.30 pm. No one told the people waiting to pick the passengers up what was happening and if asked one person would tell you thing and someone else would tell you something different.

Flew Moline IL to Punta Gorda (or tried to) on 1/27/14. Half hour before landing announcement made we cannot land because of fog and are being routed to Sanford FL. Cannot land at another airport because not enough gas. Land at Sanford airport closed staff had to be called in. Told we would be getting hotel room only to really find out that we would be paying for the room because it was weather-related. 180 some people for 40 hotel rooms doesn't add up - a lot of whom were elderly. Most of us left on our own at Sanford airport with nothing slept on floor. No food or beverages offered. No customer service. Rented car when rental agency opened and drove to Fort Myers. Will not be flying Allegiant again!

### Allegiant Air customer review
Original flight out on Allegiant #1065 January 17 was eventually cancelled and we never actually flew it. We returned on Allegiant #1064 on January 23. Allegiant Air 757-200 servicing Spokane is not equipped with necessary technology to land in regions frequent foggy conditions. Allegiant misinforms customers of flight status when you can find out what is actually going on with your flight using FlightAware. Allegiant kept moving out the "delay" in two hour increments up to four hours after the flight had left the diverted airport for the return to the destination never actually arriving in the departure city.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Maiden trip from PIE to SWF on 10/31/13. On time definitely a no frills airline. Stewards and stewardesses complained the whole trip about having a 4hr layover. Now the return trip: My flight was scheduled for a timely departure! Approx 7.30pm that meant being there by 5.30. Never received text alert and airport screens showed on time schedule. An announcement was finally made at 7.15pm of the delay we would hopefully be boarding after it arrived at gate at 9.15-9.30. After arriving after midnight I still had a 2 hr drive home. I can usually fly back and forth with just a personal item but rudeness is unacceptable. Everything is an added fee: seat water snack carry on checked bag priority seating etc.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Honolulu to Las Vegas flight was delayed we boarded the plane sat for over an hour on the plane had to deboard the plane wait 2 more hours and was eventually told the flight was rescheduled for the following morning. The next morning we sat on the plane over an hour for fuel before take off. Flights appear to have delays/cancellations for some reason and customer service department is horrible. Not a customer friendly airline and troubles are not worth the initial savings since you usually end up spending more in the end with unreliable flights.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Punta Gorda to Knoxville on Jan 9th 2014. Flight was delayed 3 hours to start off with then after 2 hours of waiting we were sent to another part of the airport to wait after the 3 hour delay we were told the flight had been cancelled. Had to find another ride back home which is a good 45 minute drive. They said it would be rescheduled for 6am the next morning. After arriving at the airport at 4am the next morning the flight was delayed again and we finally boarded 2 hours later then left for Knox. We got over Orlando and we had to turn around and go back to the airport. Finally get to Knox then we have no gate for the plane to go into so we sat on the runway for about an hour. This experience was unacceptable and very costly if you consider the cost of 2 trips back and forth to the airport. Trip back was not as bad but also a delay. Yes the flights are very reasonable but just be prepared for delays.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Booked the first flight in the morning out of Las Vegas (8am). When we arrived we were told our flight would be delayed a few hours they didn't know how long and offered us $10 in food vouchers? By noon they were still unsure and said they "may" have a plane coming at 2pm but that was not a certainty. I told them I needed to be home and asked about the 2.30 pm flight. The response was that I could change but would have to pay and it would cost $1600 to do that. When I returned 12 min later the desk was swamped and she was giving away the seats she had just told me I would have to buy for $1600! I asked for my checked bag back so I could use another airline she stated that she did not have any staff to retrieve the bag! After no communication and other Allegiant flights we finally got a plane 9 hours later. They actually closed down the desk after an hour of people asking what was going on and when we may possibly get out. The new plane was small and it was all open boarding. We had originally paid for seats and priority boarding. When we were all on there was 2 people without seats as they had "miscounted" the seats in the new plane! They actually asked if anyone would give up their seats for a $25 voucher for another trip.

I flew from Austin to Las Vegas on a Thursday and returned on a Sunday. I had nothing but positive experiences the entire time. The $55 airfare was a steal compared to the other airlines which made it pretty easy to overlook fees for luggage and seat selection. I am 6'6" so I paid $21 each way to sit in the exit row (31st row) in the aisle and I had at least five feet of space in front of me. The flights started boarding an entire hour before scheduled take-off which I guess was nice. Both flights left exactly on time and both arrived to their destination ahead of schedule. I would definitely fly Allegiant Air again.

A group of 5 of us paid $145 total to be able to select our seats. On our flight from St. Pete's to Lex we were told it was open seating with no seat assignments. We had paid in advanced for a seat assignment. This made it very difficult for groups with small children.

My son's wedding was in Florida on Jan. 4 2014 so we booked our flights (6 family members) in August for this specVery unprofessional airline. I was on a cancelled flight on Dec 20th from Niagara Falls to Florida. Plane was re-routed even though flights were landing and taking off less then 30 minutes away out of Buffalo and while we were waiting flights were landing and taking off from IAG. we were told around midnight that flight was cancelled and we would be contacted as to when it would be re-scheduled. We had originally booked with plenty of spare time to get us to our cruise ship before it left and the new scheduled flight was too late. Thank goodness US air stepped up and had seats available. We signed up for the text alerts and never received a single one - the only way we knew the flight had been re-scheduled was that another passenger informed us - our email didn't come until after 10am the next day - way too late. Allegiant didn't offer any assistance or information as to hotels transportation - just that we had to get out of the airport. Flight home was also over 2 hours delayed due to mechanical issues. Seats were the smallest and most uncomfortable I have ever been in and there were no complimentary beverages offered. Initial flight prices may look good but do not be deceived - by the time you add baggage and everything else it becomes very expensive. I will never fly Allegiant air again and will ensure none of my family or friends do! Worst airline I have flown.

Returning from Las Vegas on Jan 6 2014. Got to the Las Vegas airport and was told the flight was delayed by 4 hours due to pilot being timed out. Does Allegiant never have any stand by staff? By the looks of the gate that day all Allegiant flights were very delayed. The weather was fine so very little in the way of excuses for them. I doubt I will ever fly Allegiant again as this is the 3rd time with problems.

My son's wedding was in Florida on Jan. 4 2014 so we booked our flights (6 family members) in August for this special occasion. We were scheduled to fly from Knoxville to St. Petersburg/Clearwater on the morning of Jan. 1. Two family members went early to Knoxville and were at a motel on the morning of Jan. 1 when they received a text that the flight was cancelled. The other four of us were on the way to Knoxville when we were called by our family members and told of the cancellation. I spent 45 minutes on hold arranging for new (replacement) tickets from Lexington KY to St. Pete that afternoon. We finally booked the tickets and headed north to Lexington for a 1.15 pm flight. We pulled into the airport and arrived at the ticket counter only to find that the flight was delayed 4 hours. We spent several more hours killing time until the flight took off at 6pm. We arrived at St. Pete too late to get our rental cars. Both the originating flight and the return were operated by Sun Country which seems to be a much better airline. The only thing that made the travel acceptable at all was Sun Country. I will never fly this airline again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We were group of 8 travelling on December 26 flight 221 from Bellingham to Las Vegas. Told that flight was cancelled - Allegiant offered hotel vouchers to passengers who lived 50 miles away. Allegiant didn't have any service personnel at Bellingham airport who could help with re-routing to get to destination only way was over the phone with long wait. Allegiant accepted all passengers who wanted to continue on flight next day. We all lost one day of paid hotel accommodation and one day of paid 2 rental cars. Return was a little less disrupted just delayed for one hour and 20 min. Reason was 'they didn't have crew for airplane'. We all decided that Allegiant is going to be last choice in our travelling due to unreliability.

Flight 210 leaving Bellingham at 9am going to Palm Springs CA. Got to the airport at 7.30 am and was told the flight was on time even though it was snowing. Got into the boarding lounge and told it was delayed until 10am due to the snow and runway not being clear. At 10am it was still not flying with little updates. By 3 pm when I checked the flight status online it showed it was cancelled. Went up to ask the staff and was told no the flight will go out as soon as they have clearance to fly. After they cancelled 3 flights due to apparent weather and gave us a phone number to call to be put on the next flight. Stranded for 36 hours I finally got out of Bellingham December 21 2013 at 7.30 pm.

Flight 184 from Phoenix/Mesa to Eugene OR 1/3/14. Save the time money inconvenience and fly one of the reliable airlines. They advertise low rates but when you add the bag fees seat fees this fee and that fee it is actually more expensive. Went to the airport today for flight flight was delayed 3 hours. No explanation and none of the customer service people knew why. Sat and waited then flight is cancelled until tomorrow. Again no explanation.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Our 65 min flight from Phoenix was 4 hours delayed upon arrival at the airport. There were no weather concerns as far as we could tell. Apparently Allegiant has no reps at airports just the contractors who process people onto the planes. We were advised not to leave the airport as the situation might change. Two texts later from Allegiant had the flight delayed another 1.25 hours. The promised food and beverage coupons did not show up in the boarding lounge as promised (we waited and hour). Apparently it takes time to print the vouchers! Trying to contact Allegiant customer service produced a 30 min wait on "Live Chat" or 60 min wait on the phone. Never again!

### Allegiant Air customer review
Fort Myers FL on Dec 26 flight was delayed going to Knoxville TN and I returned home at 1.30 this morning. This is by far the worst airline I have used. In the past 3 years we have traveled Allegiant over 30 times and each trip it has become a joke. They are never time staffed or polite. I am currently waiting on a flight I received an email this morning telling me that the 2.30pm flight was being delayed until 11.30pm. I have since tried to check for updates online and by calling the customer service line. After waiting an hour and twenty minutes to speak to the customer service rep she told me that the flight should still be leaving at 11.30pm.

### Allegiant Air customer review
On a flight from Grand Forks North Dakota to Sanford Florida this past December 2013 my flight was canceled. We sat on the tarmac for an hour while they figured out what was wrong and another 30 minutes locating the part and trying it again. Finally they determine they could not fix it. Well the next day they had it fixed. However they determined the plane was too cold for the passengers so we had to wait for them to warm it up. Once they warmed it up they determine the water was frozen in lavatories. So the only guy working had to get several pitchers of hot water to try to unfreeze the sinks but to no avail. Finally he said to use the hand wipes so we boarded and finally took off. I had bought the trip-flex and used it to change/extend my return flight since I was delayed a day. However you can't change it online you have to call in. Well it seems that this cheap airline is cheap in labor and maintenance.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Recently returned from a trip down to Florida originating from Niagara Falls NY over the holidays. Our flight was scheduled to depart from Niagara Falls IAG airport at 11.57 am on Dec 23 2013. Arrived early only to find out that our flight had been delayed an hour. We purchased food at the airport cafe while we waited. Around 12.30 pm we were told that the plane was being re-routed to Ohio due to poor visibility and our flight would be further delayed. We had to wait a further 2 hours before boarding at 5.30 pm due to outstanding paperwork on the plane. We did not receive timely or detailed updates during this 5.5 hour delay. Not knowing when our flight was going to depart passengers including ourselves were forced to purchase food and beverages multiple times from the airport cafe and vending machines. When we finally did take off at 6.15 pm (6 hours later than our scheduled departure) we were offered complimentary snacks and beverages on the flight. I had hoped that our return trip would be redeeming for Allegiant however I was once again disappointed. Our return flight from Punta Gorda (PGD) to Niagara Falls (IAG) on Dec 28 was scheduled for 3.30 pm. Arrived at the airport at 1.30 pm only to be notified by the check-in counter that our flight had been cancelled. Told our flight would be rescheduled but it could be anytime the next day. We did not receive any notification until 12.55 am. Our flight had been rescheduled to 1.44 pm on Dec 29 so once again we repurchased food for the flight and drove another hour from Naples to Punta Gorda. Prior to boarding (at 1.25 pm) we were told by the representative that since the chartered plane had a different seating plan than the regular Allegiant planes passengers can seat themselves anywhere regardless of whether they paid extra and pre-ordered seats or not. In addition upon going to the restroom on the plane I was shocked to find that there was no running water in the washroom and we could not wash our hands.

My family flew round trip from Rockford IL to Punta Gorda FL over the 2013 holidays. Our trip to Punta Gorda went very well. I am blind and one of the flight attendants came up to me as soon as I got seated with my family and offered me a personal safety briefing which I gladly accepted. The seats on the airplane (a Boeing MD80) weren't that comfortable and did not recline and there was no hot coffee available for purchase. The crew were professional and we got from point A to point B safely. On our return trip we were diverted at the last minute to Moline (2 hours away by car) because of freezing rain in Rockford. According to what passengers were told later we were unable to land in Rockford because there was a plane stopped on the runway and there was not sufficient room for us to land safely. On our arrival at the diversion airport the flight attendant working the forward cabin went through the usual post-flight announcements even going so far as to tell passengers not to smoke until they were outside the terminal to claim our luggage at the baggage claim area and how to book future travel on Allegiant. Upon our arrival at the gate we were informed—that in addition to the weather in Rockford our plane had a mechanical problem. Passengers were sent into the airport and told that further information would be provided to them when it became available. The flight attendant showed no sympathy. The Allegiant representative at Moline was wonderful. There was little information available about when—or even if—the plane would be repaired and sent back to Rockford. As we were leaving the airport the gate agent announced that the plane had been fixed and that anyone wishing to go to Rockford should go back to the boarding area. The real issue for me was the lack of professionalism from the crew on our return flight. I might have been willing to overlook the diversion and mechanical problems if the crew had been sympathetic calm and professional. But everything on the return flight added up to a never-again” experience.

Awful experience and will never travel again. Was supposed to leave Cedar rapids on Jan 1 at 8.50 am and was notified at midnight that it was cancelled. They said that I would receive a message by 3pm Pacific time for the rescheduled flight but did not receive any news. Finally found out my flight would leave at 7pm on Jan 2 (36 hrs after the original departure time) only to find out it was delayed again. I was then told I could switch my departure city to Des Moines IA so when I called to do that they cancelled that flight as well when I was on the phone with the agent. Never experienced such awful customer service.

On Dec 29th our flight from Mesa to Missoula was canceled at 6am one hour prior to our departure with no reason given. We were assured that airline representatives would be available to help us get rebooked. They did not appear for two hours and we ended up standing in line for three hours to get our hotel vouchers. No one seemed to know what was going on. This was my first flight with Allegiant Airline and I was greatly disappointed.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We were scheduled to depart at 9am on 20th Dec 2013 and were told the flight was delayed because of weather and runway was closed. Agreed it was snowing! However after a 6 hour delay during which the runway was open and Alaska Air was taking off and landing the Allegiant rep advised our flight was delayed until the next day at 8pm. On the return flight scheduled for Christmas day Dec 25th at 12.26 pm getting us home for Christmas dinner was cancelled due to "operational requirements" and wouldn't leave until 8.23 pm the 26th Dec. Airline employee told us they cancelled the flight because there weren't enough passengers! This was the only honest employee we spoke with.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I flew round trip from Vegas on 23rd and 27th December. Between the two flights I had 15.5 hours of delay. Each time I was notified in advance but both occasions they didn't have a plane and had to fly one in from somewhere else. Allegiant is based in Las Vegas I don't understand why they didn't have back-up planes readily available. The flight that finally took place on the 23rd was on the oldest plane I have ever flown on. It smelt old and musty. The flight on 27th was supposed to take off at 3pm and didn't actually get off the ground until 2.15am. Instead of getting home at 4.30pm I got home at 4.15am. Spending so much time in the airport on those two days I was able to witness their operation. They didn't not get a single flight out at a reasonable time either day I was there. Next time I'll pay the extra few dollars to fly on another airline and get where I want to go. The only good part was my bag was not lost.

This is the second trip on Allegiant and the last one we take. The web site is confusing phone customer service is non-existent. We booked travel Phoenix to Grand Island and were told we could bring 1 handbag (like a backpack) on the trip. On the way back to Phoenix we had to pay $50 each for the same backpacks! We could have taken another flight to Omaha which is what we'd do in the future.

Flight 142 PHX to Wichita on Dec 23. Cheap cheap cheap. Horrible service. Same size jets as other airlines but the ticket agents won't let you carry on the same bags that fit in the above seat storage with all other airlines. Everything is too large so you have to pay $50 to let them check it. Plenty of room once I was on the plane for my bag just another way for them to sound cheap but they are not.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Some staff professional but others quite rude. Do not pay for the so-called priority boarding we were made to wait on the long check in line as the "security" man did not appear to understand that we should have access to the priority line. Seats uncomfortable some food selections unavailable flights both ways delayed and so on. Having said that they are cheap and fly a route we travel. Like the small airports. But if there was any other option for this same route non-stop I'd gladly pay more to avoid Allegiant.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew December 21 from Knoxville to Punta Gorda. Flight was on time. Paid to sit in the third row seats were fine. Overall this airline is just fine! Significantly cheaper than all other airlines and flying to a small airport meant no traffic jams. Yes you have to pay to choose your seat and to carry on an item but still it is so much less expensive and trip went well.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Reasonably well-organized. Purchasing online was easy. Received email update when departure time changed. Flight was on time both directions. However employees could be a little more attentive. The gate attendant in Mesa was brusque. I was 'blessed' to sit beside someone with a dog - and that person was also traveling with family who had a very small child located elsewhere on the plane. The dog was whiny - as was the child and the adults were not terribly successful in quieting either. Even though there was considerable disruption in my row no attempt was made by the flight attendants to placate those other passengers who were affected. Sadly with the exception of the safety information and selling food and drinks (oh and walking through with a trash bag) they were rarely seen. Yes I'll likely use them again - but only because of the airports they serve.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We booked outbound and return seat tickets from Little Rock Arkansas to Sanford Florida (and back) on Allegiant Airlines (Flight #'s 728 and 729) at an additional $$$ expense to be told on each leg of the trip there were no assigned seats and that it was "open seating" which effectively "cheating us" out of our money. When we went to check in the staff was undermanned and we flew on Sun Valley and Miami Air rather than Allegiant (apparently subcontractor airlines?). It was an awful trip on this "a la cart airline".

### Allegiant Air customer review
Our flight was cancelled at 11.30pm with no new scheduled time give to any of us. Coming in from Canada as we are leaving the airport are told flight alerts are not available to Canadian customers not only that but no financial help for costs involved in obtaining motel rooms for the night were given either. Going online plugging in confirmation number all you find is your return trip information with no rescheduled flight information given to your itinerary number. Complete and total lack of professional shown by this airline for the customers on this flight. It readily became apparent the only concern they have is for themselves and not the tired unhappy people that had been at the Niagara Falls New York airport for hours.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I have flown this airline to and from college for the past 3 years and I never have had a good or even average experience. The check-in staff are rude and do not try to help. The worst experience was for the holidays this month not only did my flight get cancelled but I was never informed of it. Looking up the flight online said it was on time so I drove the 2 hours to the airport only to find that it had been cancelled. I had a paper for a motel thrown at me by the attendant with no directions or an address. All in all I will never fly Allegiant again. When we finally got a flight (24 hours later) the stewardesses were in the back talking.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We were late leaving Appleton by about 45 minutes when a 10 minute delay was announced. The plane smelt like an old locker room. By the time we got into Sanford we hit rush hour traffic and our Disney World tickets that we had already paid for were a waste for that day. On our way back there was a young mother with 2 tiny kids that made it through ticketing security and they shut the door to the jetwalk just before she got there. They never paged her overhead and there was a supervisor manning that gate that was extremely rude and condescending to her. She left in tears. This was on a Monday morning and my understanding was also that there wasn't another flight for her until Thursday. Also I thought the ban on e-readers on take off and landing was no more. We had to turn ours off. I will not fly this airline again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Originally the airline pushed our December 9 2013 11.20am departure (from Sanford/Orlando FL to Hagerstown MD) to 5.20pm (they notified us 2 days in advance via email). We were glad that they emailed in advance allowing us time to change plans which benefited us. However with the change to 5.20pm we arrived in horrific weather conditions and Hagerstown airport closed after we had circled for a while. So we were diverted to Youngstown OH. Allegiant paid for overnight stays for all customers aboard at 3 nice local hotels (including limo service to and from and full hot breakfasts the next morning). Hagerstown airport was not well equipped to deal with this "special" situation so it took 2 hours to get everything organized but we were very pleased at how Allegiant took care of us. We will definitely be glad to rate our experience as very positive and we will most certainly be return customers in the future.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Return flight from Vegas to Austin was delayed 4 times before they finally cancelled it at 9pm. Wasted all day at the airport and now next flight is today at 12.30pm. I won't get back to Austin now until 5 or so tonight so it'll be another day wasted. Got switched 4 times from gate to gate. Boarded a plane got as far as the tarmac then turned us back to gate due to pressure gauge failure. Sat on a hot plane for about 30 min then had to wait around for another hour for them to finally tell us flight was being cancelled. They put us up in an old hotel waited around at lobby for another hour to get a room. Then the room I got had no heat in 30 degree weather was eventually switched to another room at about midnight except this time no hot water. Took a cold shower this morning and am now waiting for 1230 flight back to Austin. Buyer beware. Do not fly Allegiant airline if you have a choice. Worst experience ever.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My husband and I have flown Allegiant before without any issues but on Dec 1 flight from Bloomington Il to Orlando/Sanford we had a 5 hour delay with no reason why and they used a a different airline (Falcon Air) . On our return flight Dec 8 again we had a delay of 4 hours with no explanation (also Falcon Air). You cannot tell me that someone did not know why they were delayed. Also $8 food vouchers and $50 vouchers is enough to compensate for long delays and no information. We wasted over 12 hours at the airport that could of been used vacationing. Will be looking into other airlines.

Dec 2 2013 Flight 2835. Dec 5 2013 Flight 834. I am very disappointed in Allegiant Airlines. They were 7 hrs late on Monday Dec 1. I was scheduled at 5.05 they called the night before and moved it to 7.40 then text and moved to 9.20 then called and moved it back to 7.40. I get to check in at 6 and it's back 9.20.The bright spot they did give us $8 for food. Of course we know the price of food at the airport. The great rate is not worth it. I lost a day of work this week. That is unacceptable.

Why does everybody expect something for nothing? We flew Allegiant on November 21 2013 from Cedar Rapids to Las Vegas. Departure was on time as was arrival. Returned on Dec 5 and once again departure was on schedule and we arrived in Cedar Rapids 15 minutes early. Yes I paid for one checked bag and one carry-on. No the seat did not recline - but at least there wasn't a kid in front of me who felt that he had the right to slam his seat into my knees. I really didn't have a problem paying 2 bucks for a Coke either. The aircraft was comfortable and clean and the total fare was reasonable. Oh I almost forgot - as a non-stop flight we didn't have to put up with the hassle and stress of changing planes in Denver or Chicago.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew from St. Pete FL to Tri-Cities TN on Nov. 5. The night before I did get an email that said that the flight had been delayed from 7.45am to 3.05pm. I was thankful for that because their were many people that didn't get the message. So about 2-2.30pm they announce a gate and plane change. They had to get a plane from another airline Suncoast. Since this plane didn't have the same seating they changed to open seating. So they boarded handicapped first then priority people then groups with small children then people with assigned seats and then everyone else (seems like Southwest seating). By the time we did all this it was about 4.15pm. They did give us water and a snack pack on the trip. So we get there late and what do you know there is an Allegiant plane already at the gate. We have to wait another 30-40 minutes until that plane leaves until we can get to the gate. There were no weather problems at either city. I overheard the Suncoast crew saying that Allegiant did have any crew available and that's why they had to change planes.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I had a flight booked on Allegiant Air for Monday December 2nd that was scheduled to leave just after 10 am and arrive in Clearwater at approximately 12.15. Instead it was after 7pm before we departed and about 8.30pm before we arrived in Clearwater. I was never notified the flight was delayed so spent nearly 12 hours in the airport as our departure time changed several times. The reason we were given had nothing to do with weather or natural disasters just that "our flight team timed out and must go on rest time and we haven't been able to find crew to replace them"! Really! Now here I am on Thursday December 5th again stranded in the airport with Allegiant Air waiting for a flight that was to depart at 5.05 and now being told it will be between 9-10pm hopefully! Reason this time again not weather "we just don't have enough planes to cover all the scheduled flights". We have chartered some planes but now that crew has timed out"!

Saw all the bad reviews and don't understand why. I have flown Allegiant many times with no delays other than weather and the staff were great. Can't beat it for the cost. Would recommend to anyone. How else can you get to Florida in 1hour 45 minutes from Ohio for 75 dollars.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I have to say no stars for this airline. So called 'customer service' hung up on me once then when my son called them back they hung up on him too. I signed up for text alerts on my phone but they did not advise me (even after we traveled 3 hours with a rental car for the second leg of our trip to Knoxville airport). After checking in we found out that the flight was cancelled for mechanical reasons for possibly 1-2 days. We ended up renting another car and drove 15 hours reaching home after 4am. What a way to end a vacation! I have to admit they did eventually refund the money because I refused the $100 vouchers they offered. Did not need the vouchers because now I intend to pay full price for a major air carrier. Just so you know because they are not a major carrier they do not make other arrangements for you and if you find a flight you can get on you re paying for it again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I had a flight on 11/11/2013 from Oakland to Phoenix. The flight was delayed 2 hours before they finally cancelled it. They didn't give us any idea if there would be a flight the next day so I had to book my own flight on Southwest so I could get to Arizona at a cost of $350. My return flight on 11/25 was delayed 4 hours! Today my fianceé was supposed to fly from Oakland to Phoenix and he just received notification that his flight is delayed 2 hours! You really can't depend on this airline. Flights may be cheap but you might have to pay more on another airline in order to get to where you want to go.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Sitting at Sanford FL airport as I write this. Arrived early for the flight back to Springfield MO. Flight was cancelled due to missing crew member last night. No notification on website. Aggravation is not worth it. Now as I sit here waiting to get within 3 hours of home on another flight and wasting an entire day I regret ever trying them on a friend's recommendation. No real recourse no food vouchers. Other choice was wait 24 hours and try again. Hotels food and transportation all at our expense. Needless to say I will never use them again and do my best to ensure anyone that will listen doesn't either. The only good thing I can say is they are direct flights (when they actually fly) and the seats weren't too bad. We were offered $100 off our next flights as if I will ever use them again. Tonight at 5.34 when the plane lands will be the last time I ever consider Allegiant Air.

11/27 flight 888 from PIE to ABE. 12/1 flight 803 from Harrisburgh to PIE. They may have low rates but nothing is included and I mean nothing. Carry on check bag water on the plane cookies pretzels peanuts not included. You must pay for everything. There is no inflight entertainment. The seats do not even recline. The planes are old and antiquated the staff are rude. No one is in a hurry for anything. They give you no information no courtesy whatsoever. They change the rules every step of the way. Every person we talked to had a different story and nothing matched. All they did was lie to us. Everything was delayed and there was no compensation to the passangers for the inconvience that was given to them. First our time was changed with no notificAtion then we were told we had to wait 4 hours because the pilot and crew needed time to rest. By the time you pay for baggage a beverage and every other thing you have paid way more than the other airlines.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I have used Allegiant Air during my 4 years while attending school out of state. Yes the cheap flights home when I had breaks were great but I was always delayed. I might have been on one single flight where everything was on time and they didn't push back the time due to "operational issues". There were also several times where I had to walk to my car in the airport parking lot in pitch black late at night because my flight was pushed back so much. Me being a young girl this was very unsettling. Allegiant feels that offering free complimentary drinks when the flight is delayed will make everything better well they are wrong. Also when you run into an issue there no settling a canceled flight at the airport you have to sit on the phone for over 30 minutes waiting for the next available travel agent. Honestly I don't think the issues that come along with booking a flight on their airline is worth the cheap flight.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Our flight from Oakland CA to Bellingham WA was delayed 5 hours - no explanations or apology were offered. The ground crew were too inexperienced and timid to criticize. They didn't seem to be in the loop any more than we hapless passengers were. There were no weather problems at either end of the flight. An earlier leg of our trip (Bellingham to Vegas) was delayed for 2.5 hours - again no explanation or apology but it was raining heavily on arrival in Vegas so we assume that was the reason. I sent an email to their customer service and got a very quick personalized but unapologetic response. I've been a life-long traveller and have travelled on many no- frills airlines so I know what to expect in terms of crowded seating and lack of freebies. However as countless others have attested Allegiant Airline is the worst because of their shoddy customer service both during and after travel. This truly is the worst airline in North America.

Austin to Las Vegas Nov 28th Flight number 453. They say low cost airline but they rip you off. Myself and wife were traveling to Las Vegas. The flight was empty and system generates random seats we both were not travelling together. To travel together we have to pay 35 USD. When I called the customer care to adjust the seats since the flight was empty I was given a very rude reply. The price we paid for our tickets we could buy with other airlines.

Took a non-stop from Fort Lauderdale to Lexington hoping to avoid the mad scramble in Atlanta. Big mistake. This airline left late due to engine issues (had to get a replacement aircraft) then when we arrived the ramp wouldn't work. It took 45 minutes for them to figure out they needed to open the rear stairs and allow us off. No discussion of perhaps just taxiing to a different gate. After replacing another hour yes hour awaiting bags. My advice skip the non-stop and stick with Delta.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Granted it's inexpensive but be ready to be delayed. Have flown it often but probably 95% of the time flights are delayed. And not just a few minutes or a few hours. More like anywhere from 5-9 hours. Totally unacceptable. Have kept trying them due to direct flights and low costs but our time is too valuable to spend so many hours sitting in airports.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Tried using this airline twice. The first time they cancelled the round-trip flight the night before departure. They didn't offer any alternative transportation. Just apologized and said I was on my own to figure it out. I had to scramble to get other transportation. I asked the customer service rep if Allegiant would give me any discount or such on a future flight. I was told I would have to email them complain and ask someone else. That was 8 weeks ago and still no response. The second time I tried to use Allegiant they cancelled the flight 12 days in advance. This time without explanation. How did they know they had to cancel that far in advance? In short the price is attractive but what good is that if you can't fly. I'll never use them again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Absolutely prefer this airline. Love the price direct flight and the smaller airports. Flew Sioux Falls to Tampa 11/16/13 and back 11/19/13. Will consider them first before any other airline.

Springfield Missouri to Punta Gorda November 14-17 2013. Flight out was delayed slightly but most time made on the way to Punta Gorda. No problems on return. $150 pp R/T including bag fee. Staff was great service was good. If you know the rules and play their game on ticketing luggage and check-in you can save money. With older second hand aircraft you are bound to have some delays but for the price you can not do better. Many trips on Allegiant and only one serious delay.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I was extremely dissatisfied with the fact that I had to pay for a seat. I chose a seat that I liked and preferred to sit in paid the fee and expected a good flight with a window seat close to the front of the aircraft. When I arrived to board I was told that we were to board a different plane and that the seat that I had paid for no longer mattered and I had to sit wherever I could. Granted I will be reimbursed the money for the seat but I paid for something I did not get and was not forewarned until boarding. I got stuck in a middle seat and was uncomfortable the entire flight. This is not good business. If a customer pays for something they expect it.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Was supposed to fly out of Plattsburg NY direct to Clearwater FL Nov 1/13 . The plane got into the air and had instrument problems within 10 minutes of take off and had to return to Plattsburg airport. A very stressful experience. The plane had to circle for about 45 minutes to get rid of fuel. Fortunately we had a safe landing and all precautions were taken with fire trucks and ambulance available if needed. Upon arrival back at the airport we were offered Pizza as there would be no replacement plane arriving for 5 hours coming from Tampa. A full refund was offered if you decided not to take the replacement flight and a phone number was given out to call. We opted not to fly. The problem started with confirming our refund. No 1-800 number a long distance call with a wait of 30 minutes only to be told that a form had to be filled out online first . Very poor customer service. In the end a refund and a free voucher for future travel that would have to be redeemed by calling that same number.

Bellingham to Vegas got to airport on time but found out our plane was delayed cause of a flat tire. 6.5 hours later we left as they had to fly a tire from Las Vegas on the next flight. They gave us water pop and a $8 voucher for food. They said they would give us a $100 voucher for our next trip on our account. I phoned them and no 800 number so you have to pay for the call. They go threw a 5 minutes of jargon and then they tell you you will be another 20 minutes. Did not wait. I flew with them when they first started great airline they and now sad to see they have gone the other way.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I had a voucher from Allegiant that I had from January 2013 and had to use by Jan 2015 which I did the end of October 2013. They had already charged me $80.00 for voucher issue which they deducted. Very hard to use website in booking a flight. I chose my seats which I paid for did not get the ones I signed up for on my departure flight. Then I made a typo scheduling my return on 12/22(was supposed to come back on 11/3. Not their fault on that. When I had to change it they charged me for seats again adding $342.00 in fees for my wife and myself. The seats don't recline nor or they comfortable. Very cheap. Will hitch hike before ever using them.

### Allegiant Air customer review
3 hour delay to destination and 4 hour delay coming back. Both flights were nonstop but could not get out of the airport and this was not weather related. Thought we would give Allegiant a try due to convenience. Going back to the big guys.

### Allegiant Air customer review
When flying Allegiant Air - check your VISA statements. Our family booked for an upcoming trip to Vegas and should have been charged $3021 however we just received our statement and we were charged 4 x for same trip. Then the whole frustrating deal trying to talk to a human - first you have to email them then they will give you a phone number then you have to phone and wait time is between 30 - 90 minutes (in our case 90 minutes of Long Distance from Canada) only to be told they don't see the error on their end so send them the visa statement as proof. Which I did and asked for confirmation that they received fax as well as confirmation when it is corrected. No customer service No apologies.

Flight 773 Fort Wayne to Sanford Oct 31. Flight 772 Sanford to Fort Wayne Nov 3 2013. We were charged $100 ($50 both ways) for a carry on that we hadn't prepaid for. If we had prepaid it would have been $26 total. It's the same bag why would it cost so much more if you add it at the desk? All beverages and snacks are for purchase only including water. I can certainly afford to pay for things but I hate to be taken advantage of.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Was very apprehensive about flying Allegiant after reading all the bad reviews however the return flight from Bangor to Orlando was absolutely fine. The check in staff were the friendliest I've come across in a long time the flights left on time without incident and the price was right.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flight 1703 from Los Angeles to Honolulu October 31 2013 was supposed to leave at 12.55pm we get to the airport two hours early as requested just to find out our flight was delayed to 1.45pm. We get on the plane and wait for an hour for them to fix whatever mechanical issue they were having to then be told we must leave the plane! We were advised another "rescue" plane was on its way and would arrive at 6.50pm we start getting text messages at about 5.30pm that now that flight was cancelled as well due to mechanical reasons. There were over 100 people on this flight and Allegiant says they have hotel vouchers for only about 55 people not to mention the food vouchers they decided $8.00 at LAX was enough - you can barely get a good cup of coffee for that price in this airport.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Travel with Allegiant is a nightmare! According to their own personnel their planes are old and break down often. My trip from Provo UT to Oakland  CA was delayed by 6.5 hours. The return trip one month later was an odyssey: it took 11 hours and 3 different planes before we could make the 1.5 hour trip. The first plane fully loaded with 200 passenger was not able to even get to the main runway before breaking down and was towed back. The second plane sent to "rescue" came 5 hours later but was grounded due to mechanical problems. We had to wait more hours for another "rescue plane". After boarding and ready to take off on this third plane the pilot announced that his instruments showed not enough fuel for take off and we had to wait in the tarmac to be refuelled. What started with boarding the first plane at 8.30 am in CA ended at midnight in Utah.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Just flew from Lexington Ky. to St. Pete and back. Beware you get what you pay for. Beautiful day no weather problems and we were 2 hours late leaving. Attempted to check in online and it forced me to show I was checking bags when I was not at $39 a piece gate agents had no authority to help at the airport and gave me a number to call waited 40 minutes for some guy to tell me I had to email the company and they would get back to me in 6-8 weeks. Along with the fact they have some of the oldest and dirtiest planes I have flown on this is truly the Greyhound Bus of the airline industry.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I had booked a flight to Las Vegas on Oct 20th-24th with 4 of my friends. Told our flight was cancelled due to fog in Bellingham. We were told they do not compensate for anything not even a meal shuttle or hotel. It was up to us to find our own place. We were to call in 2hrs to find out if we were to leave the next day but again no information. On top of all that we were all double booked coming back our bags were all labelled wrong. We were sent back and fourth in the waiting area and even booked to the wrong gate. Our flight home was so cold. My friends and I will not be flying with Allegiant again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Got what we paid for. Yes the airfare is cheap however when you starting adding up the extras it will amount to the same price. We live in Montreal Canada not far from the NY state border flew from Plattsburg to Fort Lauderdale. We will never fly Allegiant again. Customer service is horrible both on the phone and onboard. Staff are unknowledgeable. I will add that at the time you could park free at the airport now the charges are too high nevertheless they charge for luggage and other fees and that brings the total to the same as for someone leaving from Montreal to Fort Lauderdale Florida.

### Allegiant Air customer review
This is the most disorganized and unprofessional airline I've travelled with. My husband and I flew from Bellingham to Las Vegas. I spoke to a woman on the phone to find out how the seat selection works. She was very short with me I called a second time spoke to a different person who told me I'd be better off checking in at the airport as opposed to online if I don't want to pay and want to select 2 seats together because online it's computer generated but at the airport a real person will select seats for you. Upon arrival at the airport I was told that wasn't true regardless how you do it it's all computer generated. Our flight ended up getting cancelled due to fog and the plane landed at a different airport. It took them hours to give us this information even though they knew the flight had landed elsewhere. Finally we were told the flight would be the next day. No assistance was offered to help us with the cost of an overnight in a hotel. When a mob formed to complain they reluctantly offered names of several hotels that would provide a distress rate. On the flight the seats are pretty cramped and do not recline at all. Absolutely nothing was offered in the way of food beverages or reading material not even water. Initially you would think Allegiant is a much cheaper alternative but they charge you for everything. If you bring a carry on it's $13 in advance or $50 at the airport each way. For a checked bag it's $20 in advance or $50 at the airport each way.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My partner and myself flew Delta to and from Grand Rapids without any difficulty. Unfortunately our daughter is on a budget and she booked with Allegiant Airlines. All I can say is take the "recommendation" to arrive 2 hours prior to your flight very seriously. They will sell your ticket right out from under you. My daughter checked in 45 mins before her flight out of Mesa AZ. She was told she was too late but watched in tears as others boarded the flight she was supposed to be on! The representative stated the next flight is next Thursday! Very cold and uncaring.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I travel from the Huntington and Charleston WV area to Orlando or St Petersburg Florida at least once a month and have done so for 5 years now. Allegiant has charged a one way price as cheap as $19.99 each way and as high as $249.99 each way. Prices are very weird. I understand their schedules and schedule problems. I don't understand their prices. Allegiant is convenient for my travel plans but in 5 years they have made so many changes with booking baggage and especially seating. They never offer any kind of relief for any of their mistakes. Today I received an e-mail advertising a one way special to St Petersburg for $44.00 for dates 12-9 through 12-23. I immediately opened the website and tried to book at this price only to find out after a 45 minute wait on the customer complaint phone line that those prices sold out completely but there were plenty of seats available for $92. Gate personnel in Huntington have been very rude and even yell at passengers. Customer complaints and assistance by phone are put on hold up to an hour. Gate rules and booking rules are not enforced once on the plane. Such as overhead usage and seating. I will continue to use Allegiant but only if I can catch a good price. It is much more convenient consistent and comfortable to drive an extra 45 minutes to Columbus and book with Airtran.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Two hour delay to ride on a plane with mechanical problems treated rudely not offered even a bottle of water for being delayed. Other airlines we have flown on have given us vouchers for food when we were inconvenienced. I witnessed an Allegiant employee laugh at a customer that had waited over an hour for her luggage. We stood in line with the other passengers on our flight for 15 minutes while three agents leaned on the counter and did nothing only to find out we were standing in a line that was for re-ticketing for a cancelled flight. The re-ticketing agent was telling passengers that they were in the wrong line one at a time as they requested their boarding passes. Our agent was very gruff and acted as though he was conducting some kind of military exercise.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We were booked on Flight 541 from Monterey to Las Vegas on Sunday 10/6. After the plane was loaded a passenger had to be removed by security and the flight was then cancelled. This cancellation was not the airline's fault. But the flight the next day was scheduled for 5.35 pm and it was delayed until 7.30 pm. Then once we were all on the plane ready to go the auxiliary power unit would not turn on and there was another delay until they could get the engines started. We finally arrived in Las Vegas at 9 pm. Monday night. There were no problems with our return flight but after this experience and reading the other reviews I don't think we will take Allegiant again.

Flew from GSP to FLL this week. Flight on time and arrived on time. Fly with Allegiant every month and have only had one issue with late departures. Friendly crew and clean aircraft.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Just flew from St Pete to South Bend and back over the past weekend. We purchased and checked in online with no problems. They're a nice airline with friendly staff and clean fairly roomy planes. Our only issue was the punctuality problem they seem to have with everyone. Our flights were delayed both times by 20-25 minutes. Not deal killers but still annoying. Seems like they would be more concerned about maintaining their schedule but they don't apologize and everyone acts as if that's standard procedure. Feel free to leave the A/C on while we're waiting to depart or deplane. It gets stifling real quick.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I will never fly Allegiant again. We were told that we had to arrive 2 hours before departure at the gate this morning at Oakland Airport. We were there on time at 7.30am for a flight to Provo Utah. A half an hour before departure they tell us they forgot to notify the 1st Officer that he was flying so we waited 1.5 hours for him to arrive. Once he got there we were notified the plane had been grounded and we had to wait for another to come from Las Vegas. Flight finally took off 6 hours late. The pilot was very apologetic and said we could have a free drink on the plane but when I asked for a bottle of water they said I could only have a cup! My husband missed his 40th reunion tonight because of their incompetence.

### Allegiant Air customer review
When flying from Tri-Cities Tenn to Florida they are the only direct-flight game in town. We have used them for several years with minimal delays. They were particularly good at responding to the loss of several aircraft a few days ago. If money were no object I suppose we all would be using a chartered Lear but for most of us money is a factor and Allegiant provides reasonable service at an unbelievably low price.

We travel frequently from Clearwater to Knoxville. We have been delayed at least once on each of the last 4 trips. If someone else would take over flying to Knoxville we'd switch.

### Allegiant Air customer review
When Allegiant Air began flying from Allentown PA to destinations in Florida they were wonderful to fly with. Their staff was courteous and their flights were very reasonably priced. I told everyone I knew how wonderful my experiences were with them. How things have changed! They are now one of the rudest group of people I've ever encountered in a service based industry. During my past few trips from Allentown to Clearwater I've had one bad experience after another. Instead of trying to help they've continually stated "We are now an a la carte airline". I'm sure that they don't care but they have lost another customer.

### Allegiant Air customer review
For the money that we paid it was an excellent flight. I flew from Las Vegas to Kalispell MT - Yes they charge you for any added things such as carryon luggage seat assignments onboard drinks etc but if you are interested in a low fare and getting from point A to point B - I don't think they can be beaten. Our flights were on time the crews were cordial and the check in experience was comparable with other major airlines. Allegiant is a discount airline so you cannot compare their services with a Delta or America. They provide basic transportation at a very reasonable price. The downside to them is that unlike the major airlines they do not have a large number of extra airplanes sitting around so should you encounter a mechanical problem the plane will have to be fixed before you can fly they cant fly in an extra aircraft. I think for the money paid they provide an excellent value in airline travel - you simply must realize what they do and that is basic air transportation.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My wife and I were flying from Stockton CA to Las Vegas on June 30 after attending a wedding. The flight we were supposed to catch was finally cancelled after keeping everyone waiting for the entire day. We were supposed to leave at 2.20pm but the rescheduled flight didn't leave until 7.45 the next evening on July 1. No less than 3 other scheduled flight left for Vegas before I would have been allowed to board a plane. I refused to be at their mercy and caught a flight from Oakland that put me in Vegas around 7.00am the next morning 13 hours before the Allegiant flight finally left CA.

### Allegiant Air customer review
A couple of weeks ago I flew for $66.00 to Florida and $66.00 return. I have a vacation home south of Tampa so I don't need to take luggage. I take my purse and walk on and off the plane with no hassles. Yes I have to pay 2.00 for water pop or a snack but compared to paying 500.00 return flying from Ottawa I just can't justify spending the other 350.00 difference and Air Canada doesn't provide meals anymore. Yes I have to work around the Allegiant flight times and pay for my snacks and yes I have less flexibility but I am saving a lot of money! I find the staff courteous friendly helpful and professional. I don't need an inflight movie it is only a 3 hour trip. I applaud this airline for providing good service at great prices and direct flights.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We used this airline for a charter flight round trip from Birmingham Al to College Station Texas and then back to Birmingham out of Houston. Never again. The flight attendants were so concerned with socializing with passengers who were buying alcohol that some of us barely got or regular drinks. On way back the flight was delayed for 4 hours due to "mechanical issues" in College Station and then the flight crew had to have their FFA mandated rest period. They told us at the gate that when the crew got there the plane would be fuelled up and ready to go. When we boarded the plane it was hot and the AC was not on because of the engines not being on. The pilot then came on and told we would have to wait to leave until the plane was refuelled so we were lied to at the gate. Overall horrible experience.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I have flown many different airlines in my 76 years but I must say the charter with Allegiant to College Station Texas this past Saturday September 14 2013 was one of the most abysmal experiences I have experienced. Firstly the cabin crew were rude and professed ignorance of information regarding the charter flight. The beverage service offered by the airline would have done well in a comedy routine no coffee/hot beverages yet the bottled water was served at room temperature (no ice offered) and in this case tepid. The plane itself was dirty and odorous and the lack of ensuring the aircraft was serviced and ready to go upon departure to Birmingham from Houston Bush was out of a Keystone Kops routine. The supposed delay caused by mechanical issues was explained in 3 different stories from the same representative concerning a door that was an emergency egress that could only be opened from the outside heaven help us had we had an emergency that required using that (rear) door if it could only be opened/closed from the outside. A trip of 12 hours inclusive of a 2 hour ride to the airport passenger airport procedures and attending a 4 hour football game ended as a twenty six hour expedition. Never again will I be a passenger of Allegiant Air and I strongly discourage others to use Allegiant.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We had our flight cancelled from Bellingham to Maui this August. After standing in line for almost 2 hours we found out the flight was cancelled only when other passengers were getting calls on their cells from the airline. The counter staff looked like teenagers and were no help at all. Finally after several hours an Allegiant rep showed up and we were put up for the night at local hotel only to arrive the next morning to have our flight delayed again two more times. Very poor service. Even airline employees told us this is a recurring problem and not to fly with them at all. I think after reading all these reviews I will take their advice and throw away the flight credits they gave us for another time.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My son flew from PHX to Oak 9/6/13. The plane was delayed 1 hour for weather and 2 more hours waiting for a replacement crew member. Return flight was set for 9/9/13 at 2.30pm here it is 8.40pm and they have just taken off from Oakland. There were "mechanical issues" is what they were told. There were a limited number of food vouchers available and warm bottle of water at the gate. When I called the airline I was told they do not refer to another airline and that "pizza and drinks were given out at the gate". This was not what I was told by the agent in OAK when I spoke to her at 4 pm. Told they would however give me a $50 voucher for another flight! Never again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We have flown Allegiant since they came to our area and have never had a problem We flew out September 1st to Las Vegas. Ticket agent was great fast and friendly plane took off on time and we even landed in Las Vegas a few minutes early. Return trip was the same ticket agent was friendly and funny. Flight attendants on both flights were friendly. Plane took off on time and we landed on time. Ok so the seats don't recline not a problem we just stood up once and a while to stretch our legs. Food no problem the wife packed some snacks for the flight out and the return trip. All in all we have had great trips with Allegiant and we will continue to fly with them. We love the direct flights.

### Allegiant Air customer review
You get what you pay for! We have flown with them 6 times and noticed that there is a 50-50 chance that you might make your destination on time (or on the same day). Do not depend on them to get you anyplace on a tight schedule. We always allow 1 day between connections. Departure passengers often sit on the plane for hour(s) - sweating/freezing - while the status of the flight will be reported as "in route". Very often the Flight Staff are a blessing and they have a lot of humor about how bad the service is (In Flight Entertainment!). If Allegiant promises you a refund/voucher don't hold your breath. SWA will be about the same price once you factor in the extra $$ on bags seat assignments old Coke and bagged peanuts.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Attempted to fly my sister out from Oakland to Reno during the first week of their new route. She was supposed to leave at 5pm and arrive at 5.55pm. The plane has now been delayed 3 times and now projects a 4 hour delay which is the amount of time it took me to drive the same distance last weekend. When I inquired with the airline about the delay they replied "we have no information about the reason for the delay". When I expressed my own concern about a delay that was so long given the length of the route they did not seem concerned and instead gave me a canned answer about variability in reasons a flight is delayed. I wish I had read the reviews on here before purchasing a ticket. Apparently a flight schedule for Allegiant is kind of like throwing a penny in a wishing well.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flew Allegiant for the first time from Bellingham to Maui. Flights were fantastic (left on time and arrive in Maui 30 minutes early). We are a family of 4 from British Columbia Canada and by flying Allegiant we were able to save over $3000 in air fare. The flight wasn't full so you could spread out between the seats or sleep on 3 if you wish. We brought our own food and purchased bottle water at the airport. Yes the planes are basic and don't have TV's etc. but if you're prepared (bring your own portable DVD players cards books etc) the flight was good (actually spent time talking to our kids rather than having their noses stuck to their phones). Would definitely fly Allegiant again already planning our next trip!

Niagara Fall to Clearwater. Waited close to 12 hours on the trip down only to have it cancelled late that night. We were not allowed to leave the airport let alone go outside for some fresh air. Staff at the airport were very accommodating and apologetic however the person who was calling the shots on how to handle the issues missed the ball entirely. Finally got out the next morning with another 2 hour delay. Coming home there was another mechanical issue with our plane and we were delayed another 4 hours. An awful experience.

Flew from Niagara Fall to Clearwater. It was supposed to be a 3 day get away. Waited close to 12 hours on the trip down only to have it cancelled late that night there were no other planes available. The staff at the airport were very accommodating and apologetic however the person who was calling the shots on how to handle the issues missed the ball entirely. We finally got out the next morning. There were quite a few Allegiant planes at the terminal the next morning not sure where they were the day before. Coming home there was another mechanical issue with our plane and we were delayed another 2 hours. We've flown many times and have never experienced any lengthy delays like this one. Our whole trip was book thru Allegiant waiting on rebates hope that comes on time!

Got what we paid for. Yes the airfare is cheap however when you starting adding up the extras it will amount to the same price. We flew from Bellingham WA to Honolulu it was about a 6 hr flight. The seats do not lean back. Therefore for the whole 6 hours you are sitting straight up. We will never fly Allegiant Air again. Customer service is horrible both on the phone and onboard. They are unknowledgeable. I hope Allegiant is reading these reviews and take notice.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I paid for carry on luggage since I was only on a 3 day trip to PIE out of LEX. I requested wheelchair assistance which they provided without problems. The kids who brought me to and from the gate at both airports were great. Boarding the plane in LEX the flight attendant looked at me as I got out of the wheelchair and looked at my carry-on. She asked if I could lift it and I said no I would need help. She practically ripped it from my hands and said "well I can't do it for you" and said it would be gate checked. I let that go but on the return flight again I was asked if I needed help and again I said yes. She threw it in the overhead and said "next time check it!". I will gladly pay more for another airline to avoid flying with them again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I was on a flight from Montana to Las Vegas. Plane arrived 2 hours late was not given a reason or an apology. Once everyone boarded the and were just about to take off (or so we thought) the plane had "technical difficulties" and we were forced to sit on the parked plane for another hour and a half! The flight attendants were rude and did nothing to make us feel comfortable as we sat there with no explanation as to what was even going on or when we'd be leaving. I then missed my connecting flight because we were five hours late getting to the airport and was stranded in the Las Vegas airport by myself forced to spend $540 on a new ticket to my final destination to Chicago. They charge you for every bag the service is unbelievably poor. They do not care about their customers.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We travelled for 3 years on Allegiant from various locations in Montana and Sioux Falls as flights were a great deal and they were direct flights to LA. Last year the charges for carry on luggage were introduced and that was just about a deal breaker. Then when we had to exit from the back of the plane on the LAX landing strip after two hours in the plane due to another mechanical problem after having waited approx. 3 hours on our trip down the week earlier due to mechanical problems that was the last straw. We no longer felt safe on this airline the numerous mechanical delays you read on this website site attest to this. It was a good airline once. It was a good value once. No more.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Sanford to South Bend and back. Flight home was Sunday Aug 18th 2013. I do fly this airline but things keep changing and flights getting cancelled. My complaint is that 2 travelers flying together getting tickets at the same time and paying with 1 credit card are put in two different rows. This is 2013 when you can do anything with technology. When I addressed this onboard I was spoken to rudely. My theory is I was being punished for not paying for my seat and other passengers agreed.

### Allegiant Air customer review
A week ago our daughter and granddaughter travelled on a direct flight from LAX to Billings MT. They were to arrive at 8.05pm. They arrived at 1.50am. A 6 hour delay. They were given $8 in food vouchers. Since we are an hour from the airport we didn't get to bed until 3.30am. Shockingly enough just 7 days later on their return flight yesterday they were again delayed. This time 7 hours! They were supposed to leave at 8.05pm but were delayed until 2.50am. They didn't arrive home until 7.45am. This time they got $8 food vouchers and $50 trip vouchers which are useless as we will never use this airline again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Their rates aren't that cheap after totalling all of the add-ons and my time is much more valuable! Arrived at the gate in Vegas exactly 1 hour before we were to leave. They did not start boarding until 20 minutes before plane was to take off it took almost 45 minutes for them to get the plane loaded. After waiting in line to take off we were almost an hour late leaving Las Vegas. When we landed in Grand Junction another Allegiant jet was in our space. We sat on the tarmac again. They had two people to work both planes! Luggage was another hour. A 57 minute flight took us 5.5 hours! We could have driven from Grand Junction to Las Vegas in the time it took us for this direct fight.

Four hour flight delay leaving Provo UT for Oakland CA which meant that I would be missing the meeting I was going to. Flew to Oakland and on the return trip I had an 8 hour wait. Both times it was mechanical problems. They kept announcing vouchers they would be giving out. Everyone thought they would be for future tickets but instead they gave $6 food vouchers.

Arrived at Peoria Il. airport 2 hours early on July 22. Instead of leaving at 5.20pm because of problems we didn't leave until 10.20pm. Arrived in Las Vegas at 1.40am arrived at our hotel at 4.15am. We could have almost saved a night's lodging. Returning from Las Vegas to Peoria 2 hrs. late - they were short a plane! 40 Minutes on the tarmac doing paperwork. All in all it was not a bargain experience.

I took my first and last flight on Allegiant had to go to Montana for business. Flight to Montana was over 3 hours late. Flight leaving Montana (different city) was over 8 hours late sat on plane for 2 hours with the same excuses as outbound. Replacement plane had to be flown in from AZ. but it wouldn't arrive for 2-3 hours. 30 mins later the plane coming from AZ is no longer going to come. The Allegiant reps at the ticket counter were not able to change a passengers ticket to a different flight had to call the customer service number. Was on hold for 1.5 hours trying to talk to customer service. Ended up missing my Southwest connection in Vegas.

Flew from Boise Idaho to Las Vegas on August 1 2013 - flight #469 delayed 3 hours. Return flight #468 from Las Vegas on August 4 was delayed 4 hrs and 40 minutes. Sat on the tarmac for about 1.25 hours of the LAS to BOI delay due to a mechanical issue. No complimentary drinks (alcohol) nor complimentary vouchers for future flights were offered for either of these delays. I am a MVP Gold with Alaska and Preferred/Premier with Delta. Any time this happens with either of these airlines there is always something offered due to the inconvenience. First and last time for me flying Allegiant Air.

Pasco to Las Vegas 3x to Mesa 2x and Los Angeles 2x. You don't fly Allegiant if you expect comfortable seats warm service or even being on time. It's a relatively inexpensive ride that's all. Bring your own drinks and food. Get to the airport a couple hours before the flight. Don't show up with overweight bags. Expect flight delays. Expect skeletal staff that's worked to the bone doing multiple tasks. Don't fly Allegiant if it's a really significant trip like attending a wedding or going to Hawaii. Don't get same-day-as-flight show tickets in Vegas. If you play defence like that and expect nothing more than bare minimum no frills travel then Allegiant isn't a bad way to fly. The longest delay I ever had was a 3 hour delay leaving Pasco for Vegas. It killed that evening there but we hadn't booked and shows that evening either. Just flew to Los Angeles this past weekend. Short acceptable delay going down. Return flight an hour delay because they initially didn't have a flight crew. That was a new one. But they flew faster and we arrived only 45 min late which is essentially on-time for Allegiant.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I have flown Allegiant about 8 times in the last 18 months. It is a great deal when everything goes according to plan. I think in the last few months there have been more and more problems. And to have your flight cancelled and rescheduled for the next day after waiting in an airport for 5-7 hours is extremely poor customer service. Staff seems to do the best they can under the circumstances. Lately I have not been getting very good rates either by the time everything is added in. I'm back to flying Delta.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Great for the price. Even with the extra charges for baggage stored in overhead and paying the small fee for a selected seat to ensure we all sat together the total cost per person was still half compared to using a major airline. We flew from Mesa AZ to Rochester MN round trip and there was only about a 30 minute delay at departure and about a 45 minute delay for the return flight. You can also save on baggage fees by paying a head on line any time before check-in. For only a 2.5-3 hour flight the tight seating was bearable. I would hope for a longer flight that they use a larger airplane with more room for comfort.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I have taken 3 flights from Des Moines IA to Las Vegas the last 3 years. Overall the price was good flights on time and staff friendly. Even with the added costs of luggage seat purchase etc the airline is still cheaper than others. The older MD 83 aircraft are a cause for concern and I am aware from friends that they have higher than average delay rate. I will still fly them because of price and non-stop service. All airlines have problems.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My granddaughter was supposed to take her first solo trip today. I had her to the airport well in advance. The board said that her flight was to be delayed 1.5 hrs. When she had made it through security I left her. I got home at 2.00 in the afternoon thinking she would be boarding around 3.00. The day progressed and she finally boarded thinking her flight would be leaving at 5.00. Well they eventually took everyone off the plane then put them back on then took them off again. I picked her up around 7.00. She had been told that the plane would leave at 8am and that information could be found online to make the changes. We can't find anything online so we hold and we hold and we hold. This is one of the worst experiences ever.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Stranded at Las Vegas McCarran International airport for 5 hours. Told that our original flight with 200+ passengers was delayed due to aircraft issues to 12.30pm and was scheduled for 9am. At 12.30pm told that it was delayed again until further notice. All we were offered were $8 meal vouchers and soda cans/water. Now we are told that an empty plane is coming for us from Phoenix. Seems like this airline is always having issues. It is possoble that our flight will be rescheduled until tomorrow morning. It is currently 2pm and we have no notice as to when/if we will be departing.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I have flown with Allegiant a few times over the last couple of years. They fly to the city closest to my daughter (St. Pete FL to Plattsburgh NY). Generally the best value and location for me and good service. All airlines have mechanical problems from time to time but I do worry about the age of the planes. They had plane trouble today (July 29) again and bussed passengers from Albany GA to St. Pete FL. I am planning a trip for November and contemplating my options based on today's flight problems.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I will never fly with Allegiant again. We booked a flight from Provo UT to Oakland and back. A simple 1.5 hrs flight. Not so! Both flights had a 4 hour delay. The only compensation given was a complementary drink. Planes are to old and need to be replaced. The seats do not recline and carry on bags are $25. You can take your chances but I never will again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My mother flew myself husband and our two minor kids from Ft.Wayne Ind to Tampa/ST.Pete. When we boarded the flight attendant told us to throw out the drinks we came on plane with even though their website says you can bring food and drinks on board. Staff very rude. On way home the plane was in horrible conditions. We were unable to sit with our minor kids but some fellow travelers did switch seats with myself and my 7 yr old daughter. Never again will I fly them.

### Allegiant Air customer review
My wife flew Allentown-Sanford one way on July 7 and all went smoothly. No hassle printing out online boarding pass with aisle seat assigned for free no security hassles at under-utilized ABE airport flight smooth was actually due in 10 minutes early but in fact arrived on time. She was travelling with a personal item only so no extra fees to her rock bottom one way fare. I agree with prior reviewers that their fees do add up quickly so plan accordingly. Also keep in mind Allegiant flies from small airports which generally mean higher fares so at least you get the non stop service with them. Also bear in mind if you suffer a delay which is common with all airlines these days this could have been time wasted with 1-2 hours at a hub airport. As in most customer service reviews people quickly point out the bad without reporting the good. My advise is give them a try and judge for yourself.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Waiting at the airport more than 5 hours and still here. The management keeps telling us stories. I am flying from GSP to FLL. I come to GSP each year to visit my kids at summer camp. They pulled the same thing last year. I will never fly them again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Booked 3 passengers at the same time from Mesa to Duluth. Each seat was in a different row. Seriously? Another way to get you to pay money. Flight left at 6.45 am - we were told that once we were at altitude they would be coming around with the snack cart where all items were for sale however no coffee or tea but they had a full assortment of alcoholic beverages. Really? I can't get coffee but I can buy a beer? No thanks! No delays on the flight but waited for an hour for our bags at baggage claim. Spend the extra money and fly another airline.

### Allegiant Air customer review
I get that this is a bare bones service but when an airline resorts to intentionally separating people because they didn't pay to choose a seat that's going too far. Not only that on a 2/3 full aircraft (both ways) they wouldn't let us move. This was on a flight between Bellingham and Honolulu in January 2013 and instead of impressing us with their value they were mean spirited in an attempt to extort a few more bucks. We won't fly Allegiant again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Ft Lauderdale to Greenville. Seems to be a consistent theme on this site. 4.25 scheduled departure - actual departure - midnight. Reason - 'mechanical' issues. There were 40+ kids on our flight heading to camp and still had a 2 hour drive to NC after we landed.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Nov 2012 we flew out of Bellingham family of 5 2 adults 3 under 12. We saved almost $1000 flying Allegiant the parking was where we saved as well as Allegiant flies into smaller airports. Check in was fine and we paid for assigned seating. Well worth it as we were 5 and we had the first row. The seats were fine no complaints. Flight left on time. The cabin crew were nice and attentive. No high pressure sales. My kids loved the snack packs they sold on board and I didn't mind paying for them they were not that expensive. The plane was clean but they are older so there has to be some wear and tear. Flight times were exactly as mentioned. We paid for 5 carry-ons. Coming back we were delayed 4 hours at LAX and had to move to another gate. Yet when we boarded the flight was good. So with the small fees and delays I being not wealthy will continue to fly Allegiant.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Flights both ways from Vegas to RFD and back went well. Flight out was on time. Plane was clean and seats were comfortable. Staff very friendly and courteous. Experienced good communication from staff and pilots re: gate change need for full runway slightly warmer cabin until engines full on and longer taxiing and delay about an hour on return flight. Airline does charge for both carryon and checked bags and food/beverages but this is mentioned on their website. Smaller plane so important carry on baggage meets their specifications which is listed on their website. I had no problems re: carryon checking in and printing online boarding pass. Overall a good experience with them. Would fly them again.

### Allegiant Air customer review
First time and last time flying Allegiant. Flew from South Bend to St. Pete. First flight delayed 3 hrs. We had just begun take offf when we stopped abruptly and were told there was a gauge problem. We had to deplane while we waited for the maintenance crew to drive back to the airport! On the flight home we were delayed an hour again due to an air-conditioning problem. Sat on a very warm plane and finally left after the captain said we could fly with one air conditioner working. No free drinks were offered for all these inconveniences which were significant! The low price of fares is also not worth it because you have to pay for everything from checked bags to overhead bags and seat assignment.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Plane was 3 hours late. After arriving in LV we had to sit on the tarmac for 3/4 hour until a gate opened up. They are trying to run an airline to maximize someone's profit at the expense of customer service.

### Allegiant Air customer review
We signed up for text alerts for the 6/28 flight from Punta Gorda FL to Springfield IL. As expected we received alerts that the flight was delayed from 3.20 pm to 6.35 pm. Instead of sitting at the airport for a few hours waiting I chose to arrive 1.5 hours before the flight was scheduled to leave at 5.10 pm. When I arrived I learned that TSA closes at 5.00. There were no Allegiant employees at the ticket counter and when we attempted to contact "customer service" we waited for over 1 hour only to be disconnected and then called back to be hung up on. Told that we still had to be at the airport 2 hours ahead of the original scheduled flight. Why would they offer text alerts if they still expect you to be at the airport?

### Allegiant Air customer review
St Pete to Allentown PA we were delayed 2 hours and had to deplane bad weather was ahead. We understand that but then we were put back on the plane and it was thunder and lightning and we were delayed another 1.5 hrs onboard arriving 3.5 hours late. On our return flight 5 days later arrived to be told of a 2 hour delay finally they pushed up the time for boarding after 1.5 hours and we were in the air close to our destination an announcement was made that we could not land in St Pete Fl and would have to go to Tampa and they would shuttle us to St Pete. There was no organization and I and 3 others waited forever for a wheelchair and then had no one to push them. We finally got going about an hour later and couldn't even find any shuttle buses so we had to rent car in Tampa.

### Allegiant Air customer review
Travelled from Niagara Falls to Sanford FL. Left us in airport for 10 hours including 1.5 hours boarded on a plane without air with temps over 100 degrees. Finally cancelled flight and had to come back next day. There was not a morsel of food and only pop and water once. Return flight included a three hour delay and one very bad experience. The risk with delays and problems are too great and you too will be disappointed.
