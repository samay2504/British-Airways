### “ an excellent flight and service”
Booked with TUI and we were informed the flight had been changed to SmartLynx. I was initially nervous about this change as I had not heard of them! But it was an excellent flight and service. Pilot was great, communication throughout the flight, adding extras - talking about places we were flying over and could spot etc. Just put us all at ease more I felt. The plane was clean and comfortable and had more room than any previous TUI planes I had been on! One of my best flights!

### "never fly with them again"
The lady at the airport charged me $90 to bring my small backpack on the plane. She said it's considered a carry on luggage, yet it fit perfectly underneath the seat with lots of extra room. It's ridiculous. I'll never fly with them again.

### "low quality service"
Not Verified |  Very bad airline with low quality service, old planes. Crew was nice but this doesn't compensate big delay and old aircraft, plus small terrible sandwich and lack of beverages. No alcohol drinks, nothing

### “Very poor management
Not Verified | Very sad experience on Dec 3rd 2023 in Berlin Airport. They had to leave 3-4 people behind in Berlin because in the airplane there were a few seats that were not functioning properly apparently. Regardless of our emotions or business duties we had going on in Dubai. Of course money is going to be refunded but I still can't understand how badly a flight can be organised that you oversell tickets because of badly maintained seating in economy class. Very poor management with high damage to us as passengers.

### "maintenance is non-existent"
Not Verified |  The maintenance in this company is non-existent. Engine failure during cruise. Inexperienced crew and very old airplanes. Not recommended. I could say is very dangerous to fly in this company.

### "Lynx Airlines should be ashamed of themselves"
As Canadians, we were proud that we could find a direct flight from Montreal to Las Vegas. Why not encourage a new airline that we have never tried before, we said! What a mistake that was! Lynx Airlines should be ashamed of themselves for all the stress and anxiety that it caused its customers. We were stuck in Las Vegas because your floor agents do not know their Canadian immigration rules! Before even flying Canadians to the US, you should make sure to train your people and to teach them the rules and laws. 3 months pregnant, I was travelling with my husband to Las Vegas and back with Lynx. The morning of check-in, we presented my husband's papers (valid Canadian open work permit and expired visitor visa to Canada). The agent at the front desk did not let us check-in saying that my husband is not allowed to go back to Canada without a valid visa! 1) This statement from the airline is wrong, a person who has a valid Canadian open work permit, an expired Canadian visitor visa and has travelled only to the U.S. is allowed to re-enter Canada by air. 2) Being 3 months pregnant, this lack of knowledge from the airline caused me so much stress and anxiety that it was not healthy for my unborn child. 3) We had to find a workaround to come back home to Montreal and ended up paying for an extra hotel night and food. The minimum Lynx could've done is reimburse us the leg that we missed because of their ignorance. All the extra charges that we paid: return leg to Montreal, (Taxi from Airport to hotel), (Food at Las Vegas Airport), (Extra night at hotel in Las Vegas).This review will be shared on all possible websites including google so future customers are aware of the unprofessionalism and lack of knowledge and sympathy of this shameful company.

### "Shame on SAS for selling this"
We bought a business class ticket from SAS from Chicago to Stockholm continuing to Athens. The Chicago to Stockholm flight was lovely, however the Stockholm to Athens flight on Smartlynx is a disaster. The plane has no business seats. The coach seats are as packed together as any aircraft anywhere. There is a mechanical delay, the crew is surly, not a usb or plug anywhere and everything on food menu has cost. I should have packed a lunch from the lounge. At this rate we may not get to Athens today and it's 7am. I give this flight a generous zero rating. Shame on SAS for selling this.

### "one hour flight was excellent"
Not Verified |  I read terrible reviews and I was a bit concerned before boarding today's flight July 10 at 16:30. However, we had a great experience. The A320 was just fine and the service was impeccable. They did not speak Swedish but that was not an issue. The one hour flight was excellent and the Captain calm and absolutely no issues. No inflight entertainment but it was just an hour flight. We were 10 min late taking off from Stockholm Arlanda but we were on time coming into Lulea Kallax. We loved the service and that the two attendants in the front was always smiling and very accommodating. Loved the fact that the staff and pilots greeted us as we left the plane.

### "Stay away from Smartlynx"
Not Verified |  Flight was delayed 4 hours. At first we were put off with a 1 hour delay, although it was clear that it would be 4 hours since there was no plane in Nuremberg. This first had to be procured because the pre-flight did not take place due to the crew exceeding their working hours. The statutory compensation has not taken place until today, 23.3.23. Smartlynx just doesn't react anymore and plays dead. Stay away from Smartlynx, you don't know how long they can hold out for such a chaos financially! Flug hatte 4h Verspätung. Erst wurden wir vertröstet auf 1h Verspätung, obwohl klar war, dass es 4h werden, da ja kein Flugzeug in Nürnberg vorhanden war. Dies musste erst beschafft werden, da Vorflug wegen Arbeitszeitüberschreitung der Crew nicht stattfand. Die gesetzlich vorgesehene Entschädigung hat bis heute, 23.3.23 nicht statt gefunden. Smartlynx reagiert einfach nicht mehr und stellt sich tot. Finger weg von Smartlynx, man weiß auch nicht, wie lange sie so ein Chaos finanziell durchhalten !

### "Friendly and helpful crew"
Not Verified |  Very pleasant airline. Friendly and helpful crew. Reasonable prices for food and drinks on board. There was limited choice but that is ok on a 4.5 hour flight. This was the second time I flew with SmartLynx. We had a nice flight and I would fly again with this airline.

### "Avoid Smartlynx if you can"
Smartlynx is a terrible airline and I can’t recommend it to anyone. We flew in Airbus 320-232 instead of the claimed Boeing 737 MAX 8. It had no oven so our pre-ordered meals could not be heated. We had to choose if we eat them cold or claim the refund from the catering company what makes no sense whatsoever. The caterer did its job and delivered the meals unlike Smartlynx who was unable to serve them properly. Funny enough, the ovenless Airbus didn’t stop Smartlynx from pre-selling us the meals 48 h before the flight. At the end of the day the caterer did not respond to my email but the email to Smartlynx initiated the refund process. Flight was 6:30 h long and we were squeezed like sardines in a tin. Both flights (from Tallinn to Tenerife and back) were about 1 h delayed what seems to be standard for Smartlynx. Pressing the attendance button triggered an immediate announcement through the speaker that the service will be available in 1,5 h. No one even bothered to approach and ask what is the matter - we were completely ignored. Please note that the “fasten seatbelts” sign was off. Me and my spouse had one reservation for the flight but at the check-in our default seats were randomly scattered separating us by several rows. And what we had to do to sit next to each other (hint: €€€)? To sum up: Smartlynx offers terrible service and it is not worth your money, nerves and time. Avoid Smartlynx if you can. Smartlynx uses all the teeny-weeny tricks to suck out your money.

### "if you can avoid do so"
Not Verified |  Travelled from Punta Cana to Frankfurt in economy. Boarded over an hour late. To say you were packed in like animals is no exaggeration the leg room is simply non existent. I would go are far as to say it’s only fit for a small child. I cannot see how it’s actually legal for a 9hr flight. The cabin temp for the whole flight was like a furnace and turned the water I brought on lukewarm! There are no air vents above your head try to cool down! The toilet door lock was broken and fixtures inside toilet broken with wires hanging out. This was a night flight with dozens of people standing in the smallest of aisles because nobody could get comfy and were sweating because of the heat. Could not buy water and were supplied with a mouthful of warm water 3 times during 9hrs. Rude staff with no safety briefing before take off! Disgusting airline and should not be allowed to travel long haul. Please if you can avoid do so.

### "low end budget fashion"
Operated on behalf of easyJet. Bit of a mixed bag, over an hour late. Staff appeared a little disinterested but were just about polite, but spent most of the flight behind the curtain at the front. No welcome or comms from the flight deck at anytime during the flight. Plane was tired, all a bit retro but, smooth ride, and got us home if in rather obvious low end budget fashion!

### "no information about any other delay"
Not Verified |  
Totally disappointed even before the start. We should departure at 3.40 am, now we're sitting at 6.30 am in the boarding hall in the airport with no information about any other delay beside a delay to 5.45 am. Nobody can go on the plane and everyone is stressed.

### "Staff polite. Clean plane"
Not Verified |  Flew with SmartLynx from Kos to Gatwick as a replacement for our easyjet flight in June 2022. Flight was 2 hours late departing because of air traffic restrictions. Staff polite. Clean plane. Flight was 3 hours 27 mins. No food on board due to catering restrictions but the bar was ok. Gleaming white plane with easyjet logo on each side. My only complaint was that as the plane was 15 years old the seats, although reclined, were very hard and need replacing as they gave me a numb bum after one hour - solved that by sitting on my jacket. Overall I would say don't believe the negative reviews of this airline.

### "aircraft is super uncomfortable"
Not Verified |  Operated for easyJet, this Smartlynx aircraft is super uncomfortable. I'm an average height person and I couldn't sit streight because my legs would touch the seat in front.

### "worst flight I've ever been on"
Not Verified |  I can honestly say, this was the worst flight I've ever been on. To start, it was impossible to check in online. Annoying but whatever. Then, it was also impossible to find out which terminal it was. If anyone has been to Dubai airport you will know how big it is (a 20 minute taxi journey from terminal 2 to terminal 1). Their help times are Monday to Friday 09:00 to 17:00 pretty useless since I imagine most their flights operate at unusual times. The flight was delayed by 3 hours. We sat on the runway for hours, no water or snacks or anything offered, just a captain who kept saying "don't worry, it will just be another 2 minutes" every time he spoke people laughed as it was always just a lie / treating us like fools. The plane was cramped. Lesson learnt from me - don't fly so budget if the flight is more than 4 hours. I'm happy to fly super cheap, but when you are on a flight for 9 hours (3 of those sat on tarmac or refeuling) then it becomes painful. The food looked terrible so I just had one water and one snickers for €5. Overall, a negative way to finish you holiday and I would never fly with them again. I'd recommend anyone flying back from Dubai to avoid this carrier like the plague.

### "I do not recommend to anyone!"
Horror! On the plane, everything is to be paid for, during a flight of 6 hours they don’t even give out water! If you buy something, then be so kind as to pay for cash. Flights are delayed by an hour, the departure is already standard, without warning, we made a stop in Budapest during the Dubai-Berlin flight, and thus we arrived 3 hours late! Then we have been waiting for the suitcases for two hours! As a result, instead of arriving at 12.45, I am still waiting for my suitcase at 17.00! I do not recommend to anyone!

### "we left 1.5 hours late"
Not Verified |  Riga to Valencia. This airline is a charter carrier operating out of Riga and Tallin. I have flown on them at least 8 times over the years. This flight, on their A320, was the most dissatisfying I have had. The arrival to Riga was delayed, and our return from Valencia arrived an hour late and we left 1.5 hours late. This is habitual for Smartlynx.

### "experience is pretty bad"
Not Verified |  Overall experience is pretty bad. Had a charter flight from Tallinn to Rhodes, included in our NovaTours package holiday. We flew a tiny, nearly 20 years old A320, which had nearly no leg room at all. This time we only had an hour long delay which is pretty little for this airline. Once we had our flight delayed for 10 hours. As always, SmartLynx has no free food or drinks at all. A can of coke costs about 3-4 euros, which is too expensive. What I really liked was the cabin crew, who were friendly and nice. I think they are the best part of the entire airline. The plane has no entertainment at all, although you can purchase a small colouring book for children, which costs about 6 euros (and does not even have pencils included). Our seats had a broken arm, which literally fell apart for two pieces. Under the seats there was a USB charging port, which did not work. I don't recommend flying this airline, especially on their A320 flights. If you'll have no choice of an airline, choose A321 flights. Smartlynx's A321 are a much better experience than their other aircraft.
