### “experience is worth the price”
Not Verified | I took KE172 from HKG to ICN in July 2024. As I have already known that it was a top airline, I had high expectations on it. The ground service was very good. The seat was quite wide and the cabin crew were very polite. The food was average but not many movies to watch. Although it was delayed for two hours, I think the whole experience is worth the price.

### "faulty customer communication"
I purchased a round-trip ticket from Jeju to Narita--a flight that only operates three times a week. I flew into Narita on Sunday 02/02 with no problem, but when I arrived three hours early at the check-in desk in Narita on 02/07 I was told to be on standby due to poor weather conditions on Jeju. Eventually, they announced that they would be rerouting to Incheon Airport on the mainland. The airline staff advised to either cancel the ticket (and wait until the next flight on Sunday 02/09) or take the flight to Incheon. Little did I know I would have to fend for myself. After many back and forth between calling customer service, my booking agency, and the Incheon Transfer desk, I was completely on my own. Everyone involved said they couldn't help me because I boarded the plane to Incheon and that the only situation that would involve any kind of refund would have been a cancellation before boarding the plane to Incheon. But would they have even paid for accommodation until the next flight on Sunday? I am back home on Jeju, but it just cost me almost $200 out-of-pocket costs. $50 for a one-night stay in an Airbnb near Incheon airport, $30 taxi ride to Gimpo airport (40 minutes away since Incheon doesn't have flights to Jeju), then another $90 for the actual flight from Gimpo to Jeju the following day. In summary, due to the decision to board the plane that was rerouted to Incheon last minute, I ended up paying almost $200 out-of-pocket expenses for an already pricy round-trip ticket from Jeju to Narita. Korean Air has embarrassingly poor service and faulty customer communication. Korean Air needs clearer policies regarding last-minute changes due to weather conditions for international travelers to and from an island such as Jeju which is known for turbulent weather. No accountability and shameless response from all in-person staff to transfer desk and call center.

### "caused me to miss my connecting flight"
I was notified that my Korean Airlines flight from Singapore to Incheon (Seoul) would be delayed by 5 hours, shifting the departure from 10.30 pm to 3.30 am. This delay caused me to miss my connecting domestic flight from Gimpo to Jeju, forcing my family to rebook the Jeju flight at additional expense. The flight's departure from Singapore was ultimately delayed by over 6 hours, departing at 4.30 am. Despite these issues, Korean Air refused to provide compensation for the rebooking costs incurred, citing " irregular operations at the airport beyond the airline’s control". This lack of accountability and zero service recovery was deeply disappointing. Poor customer service, lack of empathy, and inadequate policies reflect poorly on the airline's commitment to passengers.

### "went above and beyond"
Not Verified |  Korean Air went above and beyond to help us. We arrived at the airport in Honolulu to discover that our kids and their two-year-old were on a different flight than us. The staff at the desk did everything they could to help us fix it. They worked with us for about two hours until we were finally able to land on a solution and board our flights. We’ve never seen so much care and attention at an airline.

### “Amazing flight”
Not Verified | Amazing flight, even the fact that it was slightly delayed. The food was good, and the quilty of the staff was high. The cabin was clean.

### “in desperate need of an upgrade”
Outdated, uncomfortable and above all SMALL seats in business class, totally lacking privacy. KE’s (777) business class is in desperate need of an upgrade, because the current product is definitely not on par with the competition. All in all a disappointing experience, especially on a 10 hour flight.

### "crew pleasant and efficient"
Not Verified | Very impressed with Korean Air, my first time and hopefully not my last. Smart, clean modern plane, good legroom. Meal offered was near excellent, fresh and tasty, other airlines take note. Cabin crew pleasant and efficient, flight took off on time and landed slightly ahead of schedule. Would I recommend, most definitely yes.

### "stewardess always perfect"
Not the newest airplane but the cabin is clean and it is in the new configuration where you do not need to cross your neighbors if you stand up. Food on this short route is classic. Air stewardess always perfect as expected from Korean Air.

### “extremely satisfied with Korean Air”
This was my first time with Korean Air, and I chose this return flight to travel to Hong Kong even though it was not the cheapest option. We were extremely satisfied with Korean Air and the service they provided. The cabin crew was amazing, and the plane was very clean. I would fly Korean Air again without any hesitation.

### “monotonous, mechanical and uninspiring”
Was on a full flight. Check in was seamless and security was a breeze at Schiphol due to the priority security line owed to my FFQ status, but this has more to do with KLM and it's skyteam affliation than Korean Air. To start, boarding was efficient, but flight was delayed due to airport congestion. Nonetheless communication was on point and clear, so I have no fuss. Good leg room and meals as expected on KE for coach. The parts where KE fell short this time around was their antiquated low resolution AVOD and this one passive aggressive crew that served my section. Not really major, but was slightly vexed by how spoken Korean was imposed on me by this one attendant due to appearances albeit being a foreign national of Korean descent and having spoken cogent English. She just gave me bad vibes. What was new about this KE flight was a snack station that was set up in the back galley. Flown over a dozen flights with them and this was a first. As mentioned, food was good, but repetitive as the menu seldom changes. In summary, this wasn't my favorite KE flight and not sure if dull is the right word, but I felt the entire experience to be monotonous, mechanical and uninspiring.

### "seat was very comfortable"
The most amazing inflight experience one could ask for which was delivered by a crew who were so hard working, polite and always there for you with a smile displaying South Korean culture at it's best. The leg room was superb and the seat was very comfortable. I wish to acknowledge the wonderful service provided by cabin crew, wonderful people to be looked after who take pride in their job and care about the passenger. One staff stood out to be such a nice person as she went above and beyond in welcoming me but also looking after me, big thank you to her as well as the others!

### "Extremely disappointing experience"
Extremely disappointing experience with Korean Air. The website is badly designed and not intuitive to make a booking. The flight delayed twice in a single route - initial delay from 22:30 to 01:10. Sat in the lounge at 01:00 with no announcement of when the flight will board or what the revised flight time will be. First and last time flying with Korean Air.

### "three seats to myself"
My return leg back to Seoul was a red eye flight onboard a Boeing 787. Despite having three seats to myself, I was unable to catch any sleep. For the meal service, I chose the western beef option and it was just okay because it was too salty for my liking. Leg room was good and the IFE was a huge upgrade compared to what I usually experience when flying KE. There were a myriad of choices, primarily Western and Korean films and TV shows. I watched a few episodes of Friends. One notable thing that stood out on this flight was the degree of attention the cabin crew displayed by discerning which passengers needed immigrations cards for Korea based on citizenship so as to not disturb passengers in this late night flight. I was quite impressed by their attention to detail. Overall, I will definitely make KE my first pick for any travel to Korea if the price is competitive, which is seldom the case as they usually charge a premium.

### "The meal was the star"
The seat legroom, toilets, in-flight entertainment and cabin crew were good, not as excellent as advertised. The meal was the star of the flight. Chicken was juicy, well seasoned, perfectly accompanied by the sauce. Dessert was also quite nice.

### "Very disappointed"
The aircraft on both legs were super old with all worn out interior. Flight attendants woke me up 3 times on long haul flight to offer the food and to ask me to put my seat to upright position during meal service. The food was ok. How come in 2024 there is no wifi connection on long haul flights? Entertainment system was really old as well with very small screens. Good Arline's use that on domestic or short haul flights, but not Korean air. Very disappointed. The tickets are so overpriced for what they provide.

### "Such a big disappointment"
Very disappointed! The aircraft was old with legroom was a bit narrow. My personal screen was not working throughout the flight, could not watch movie or do anything else with it. Cabin crew was not attentive, they just did what they were assigned. One of the steward could not speak English, but only Korean, we had to slowly repeat what we would like to request but he kept speaking Korean to us. How come he was assigned to serve an international leg without speaking another language? Such a big disappointment.

### "Cabin crew was professional"
Flight was on time. The interior was a bit old though legroom was good. Cabin crew was professional, spoke English quite good. The food was tasty though no bibimbap or ice cream was served.

### "Thanks for good service"
Crew named 위다혜 was the best cabin crew that I experienced with her cabin service. She was checking on me a few times during my trip since I was not feeling good with my stomach trouble. She even offered me a medicine to make me comfortable during my whole flight time. I deeply appreciate her for the best cabin service that I had experienced for many business trips. Thanks for good service from Korean air

### "Another great journey"
Another great journey aboard KAL. Departure and arrival were both on time. Boarding was smooth and efficient. Seats were great and allowed for me to get a good 3 hours of sleep of the 5 hour journey. Crew were present and active throughout the entirety of the flight. Last, but not least was the impressive meal, which was bulgogi ssambbap. While inexpensive tickets are rare to find on KAL, they surely make your money count with the exceptional experience.

### "such a good legroom"
It has been the first time since many years that I saw such a good legroom in economy. I am 1.85m tall and quiet a big guy. Flying overnight in economy is usually a pain but the seat configuration of the B777 of Korean Air was a relief. Instead of a 3-4-3 they have a 3-3-3 configuration which allows for decent space and legroom. The plane seemed to be quite old. This was a good thing in this case because it reminded me of the good old times when flying was still a pleasure. Food was good and plentiful. No over the top service of the cabin crew but nothing to complain as well. Entertainment system is a bit old but with reasonable selection of movies etc. Good experience at check in when they told me there is actually a real person at the counter where I can check in. I encourage people to support airlines which are not maximising the seat capacity and sacrificing passenger comfort.

### "more legroom in economy class"
At least 4 inches more legroom in economy class than most other airlines I've flown. It makes such a big difference in terms of comfort and it's not something for which they charge more. With that much legroom, it doesn't matter if the passenger in front of you fully reclines. A lot of movie selections on the entertainment system and the food and service was good quality. However, I would recommend that if you are vegetarian that you place the meal request prior to flying because I saw two meal servings that had no non-meat options. The 14 hours of the flight went by faster than I expected.

### “excellent service provided by crew”
Not Verified | During my travel from Seoul to New Delhi on Flight KE 497 on 2nd December 2023, I had a very pleasant experience due to excellent service provided by crew namely Choi, Kim and Yun. They made every effort to provide comfort by ensuring our requirement of special meals during the flight. Their smiling faces during service is commendable. I wish the crew a bright future in the airline.

### “it was a solid experience”
Having flown KE several times now, I found the experience from start to finish quite predictable. Their Y product is definitely above average and surpasses most of the competition with good meals, generous leg room and great inflight customer service. There was a downside to this trip however. My seat became defective as the recline lever wouldn’t return the seat back to its upright position, but kept reclining. The steward attempted to rectify it, but the problem only repeated once I reclined after meal service. Moreover, KAL’s AVOD system isn’t my favorite as the selections are limited and feels oriented primarily for a Korean audience. All in all, it was a solid experience and I’d fly again if the price Is right.

### "Really great experience"
Really great experience. Really good food, more legroom on average, and great flight attendants. They give you a lot of goodies for comfort on international flights. Only thing that isn’t great is their website.

### “Absolutely horrible customer service”
Not Verified | Absolutely horrible customer service. Unable to book a seat with my family even though there are seats available. They would not let me select a seat even if I upgraded. Try to correct weeks before the flight and did not help.

### "she was so helpful and courteous"
Not Verified |  I and my husband travelled back home from Seoul to London with Korean Air. I was unwell and the air hostesses treated me with such kindness it was so comforting to me as I was in a lot of pain. Kim was especially kind and kept on giving me my hot water bottle. Kim was the perfect airhostess as she was so helpful and courteous a true asset to Korean Air. Thank you Kim for making my long 14 hour flight more bearable.

### "No courtesy to passengers"
No courtesy to passengers. Flight was delayed by 4 hours so I missed my connecting flight with the same airline. Rebooked to a flight 11 hours from original flight. Asked for hotel accommodation and compensation. They said they are not responsible for the delay, so they won’t provide hotel or compensation. Assuming they’re not responsible, they should extend some courtesy or apologize and offer some comfort to passengers like me who had to wait 10 hours for my connecting flight. Rude, unapologetic. Terrible service.

### "above average legroom"
Very satisfied with the overall experience. Airfares include checked baggage, which makes the cost of flying direct only marginally more expensive than flying via a hub in continental Europe or the Middle East. Ground and in-flight service good. Food reasonably good, but how can Korean Air run out of Bibimbap? The above average legroom of 84cm in Economy is much appreciated by this 185cm tall man, so much more comfortable than Lufthansa's pathetic 79cm. But I hate reclining seats and feel they should be banned by IATA.

### "service by the flight attendants was ok"
Not Verified |  The service by the flight attendants was ok, but for a layover of 22 hours while offering nothing to accommodate the customer, this is very bad policy by Korean Air. Even if transit hotel was not offered, at least offer a meal, pillow, blanket etc.. I wasn't even allowed to take the pillow and/or blanket from the flight to use at the nap zone area. The jet lag from the flight afterwards was devastating.

### "service is very shabby"
Korean Air is a national flag carrier in 2023 that is still not offering WiFi for long haul routes. As a businessman this was an astronomical inconvenience as the flight was 11 hours long! Compared to airlines such as Emirates Korean Air's aircraft, interiors and quality of service is very shabby and below par. Just because it's Korean doesn't mean it's better. Their national airlines are oddly much worse than all of their other forms of public transportation.

### "I’d fly them again"
This was a short one-hour flight. My original flight was delayed by an hour so I appreciated the option to opt for an earlier one at no charge. Here were the goods to this experience: check-in was easy, quick and no hassle and the A220 plane used was new and clean. The downside had to do with the boarding process as it wasn’t smooth due to the apparent lack of any procedure and order to the process. Boarding by zones and elite status was not honored despite SkyTeam rules, which KE is a founder. Also, antithetical to a routine domestic flight onboard, there was no beverage service offered likely due to some mild turbulence. In summary, it was a good flight that got me there relatively on time for me to make my connecting flight. If the price is right, I’d fly them again.

### "Five stars service and friendliness"
Five stars for service and friendliness. The check-in area and aircraft were spotless but could have used some Asian flair and colour. The best part about the airline is its inexpensive and easy-to-pay excess baggage rates.

### "flight attendants super polite"
The Korean Air service improved from about 70% satisfaction to 99% for me. The flight attendants were super polite and calm in every aspect of my flights. Their service was great and whatever the orders in whatever the time, it was fulfilled without any hesitation from them.

### "they switched up on us at the last minute"
Not Verified |  I am traveling with 12 people and we have already reserved our seat. We planned out who is sitting where on the plane because we have 3 little kids with us and we wanted to make sure they are comfortable on the 6 hours flight. When did check again for our seat an hour before going to the airport and everything was the same. But, when we got to the airport during our luggage check-in, they told use that our seats have been changed. Our group of 12 people were scattered around the airplane. It was so difficult for my 3 and 5 year old to seat during the flight because we did not get the window seat that we reserved. We did ask people to switch but they did not want to switch. This is so horrible. Did not like how they switched up on us at the last minute.

### "We were very impressed"
Not Verified |  We were very impressed with Korean Air. We travelled business class. The staff were extremely courteous, friendly and helpful. The food was good and the fully flat layback seats and seating area had all of the essentials. Some of the entertainment options were a bit limited, but we didn't mind as just like to relax and read. If I was going to be really picky I could say the seats/bed could be softer. However, the staff more than make up for any small issues. I would definitely travel Korean Air again.

### "Great accommodation for economy"
Great accommodation for economy class. Food was filling, of quality ingredients, presented well. My flight was made Comfortable with the flight essentials provided. Korean brand is visible from the staff to the plane's design. I'll try to do the Free Culture Tour next time.

### "crew so friendly and nice"
Not Verified | The crew was so friendly and nice. The food was amazing and the seat was comfortable. I loved their Bibimbap and their side dishes. My favorite part of the seat was how much privacy you had

### "I enjoy flying with this airline"
I enjoy flying with this airline and would choose them when I can. Inflight crew: kind and friendly. Plane: clean, new, well taken care of. Food: not bad. Entertainment: they could use an expansion of the latest releases.

### "crew were efficient and friendly"
I was in Prestige Class on the Boeing 777. KE has the latest cabin product - the Apex Suites installed in their B777-300ER aircraft. The cabin configuration is 2-2-2 but every seat has aisle access. Those seated at the window can access the aisle via a narrow passage so that he doesn’t need to disturb the aisle seat passenger. As it was a red eye flight, the meal service was breakfast. I choose the Korean style breakfast of congee with condiments. The seat was wide and comfortable and fully reclining. There was a privacy divider between seats which you can use if your neighbour is a stranger. The cabin crew were efficient and friendly. At the end of the flight, the cabin manager came around to ask each Prestige Class passenger whether he enjoyed the flight. I have to point out some lapses in service which I hope that KE can address. Before landing, cabin crew did not go around to ensure that passengers lifted up the window shades. There was no way for non-Korean citizens to pre-order and pay for duty-free items for collection on board. I had to contact Sky Shop via Kakao messenger to place the order and make payment on board. I believe that this is something that KE should seriously look into as KE is an international company. There was no welcome PA from the flight deck and no announcement on the flight plan and route unlike other airlines. It was only after landing at ICN that a cabin crew made an announcement. I believe that passengers want to hear from the flight deck.

### "extra inch or so of leg room they have"
This is the third time I have used Korean for my transpacific flight. I just want to say that for economy class the extra inch or so of leg room they have is such a comfort compared to other airlines that ply the same route. The service is stellar and the meals are fairly good as well.

### "Prestige class? I don’t think so"
Prestige Class - that got me wondering so I called to hear what that covered and was told that it was equivalent to business, and as you can see on the Korean Air app, they have Economy, Prestige and First Class; it made sense. Wrong. The first long leg from Amsterdam to Incheon (Korea) was fine; own cabin, flat bed - 12 hours went fine. Food good and service OK. Annoying with face masks - only airline I’ve had to wear it for the last year or more. Next leg; Incheon to Auckland I was apparently downgraded to lower class. Prestige is not just prestige; you have to be sure that you have Prestige Suites all the way, because now I had a wide leaning chair, that was too narrow and too short to really rest well - and it didn’t go flat. Even worse; during the little sleep I managed to get, I was woken up twice by the stewardess, because my face mask was not positioned right? Arriving to New Zealand, tired after 30 hours of transportation, I saw that one of my bags (with priority tag on) was wrapped in plastic. Destroyed. In line with luggage service (after spending 1,5 hours in passport line), but finally got the document proving my bag was destroyed. They didn’t have a replacement like mine. Now after spending time again and again on mail, I still haven’t been compensated as they will only pay part of what my bag is worth and only against a receipt, that I don’t have. Prestige class? I don’t think so. Flying Korean Air again? I am sure I won’t.

### "Food and beverages are delicious"
Not Verified |  The airport was clean and fresh, the ground service is nice and boarding is easy & welcoming. Food and beverages are delicious and fresh, and the pillow and blanket included on the seats are comfortable. Entertainment is a bit outdated, no close captions for English. The flight attendants do not fulfill requests sometimes.

### "rely on the consistent service"
I have to sing my praises for the ground crew at Korean Air as they really bent the rules to get me on this flight. I misjudged the travel time to the airport as ICN is super far from the city and arrived only 25 minutes prior to departure, which should of precluded the staff to allow me onboard my flight (other airlines would usually turn a blind eye). The gentlemen at the counter worked with earnest to process my documents and speedily get me through security. This positive experience continued at the boarding gate where the gate agents greeted me with a warm welcome and forgiveness despite my late arrival possibly causing the flight to be on the brink of delay. The onboard experience was predictable in a good way as I was able to rely on the consistent service that Korean Air offers irrespective of which route or plane I fly - friendly and accommodating flight attendants, good food, mediocre entertainment and time efficiency. I watched a few flicks, requested an onslaught of snacks and beverages and felt gratitude for the generosity in the ground service I received from start to finish while I looked at the dusk of day through my window seat.

### "happy enough with this flight"
Not Verified |  Economy seat was wider compared with other airlines, legroom was bigger - the person sitting in front of me reclined her seat but it was tolerable. Food was excellent: they served bibimbap; scrambled eggs for breakfast were soft and fluffy (really nice). You can ask for snacks such as peanuts and instant noodles (Shin ramen, which can be too spicy for some people). As in most airlines, if you want soda, they do not give you the entire can, but they do give you an entire beer can though. The cabin was clean, and the flight attendants keep the toilets clean during the flight. Not too many choices of films and TV shows but it was not a deal-breaker for me; use your earphones (with one jack) instead of the usual scratchy headphones they give out in most airlines. KAL requires the use of face masks throughout the flight but does not announce this before you board - they should; they do provide face masks to those who did not bring any but it's less of a hassle if passengers knew this requirement during booking or at least during check-in. I was happy enough with this flight and will book with KAL in future.

### "an impressive airline"
Just completed a flight from LA to Incheon and it was excellent. Korean Air's strong points are its catering, leg room in economy and in flight service. The bibimbbap I had was super good and you get to enjoy it on nice Korean Air silverware. There's also Shin ramen for those who would like to enjoy a mid flight snack. I also have to give a shout out to the hardworking cabin crew that were vigilant about anticipating pax needs and for defining great hospitality. This other point may not be all that relevant for most, but I found their inflight magazine to be top notch! Not riddled with useless advertisements and boring content, but with excellent editorial pictures of destinations and useful travel tips. Conversely, this is really minor, but compared to major global carriers, the lack of entertainment choices and Wi-Fi is the airlines weak point. Still got to watch a few good flicks though. Overall, an impressive airline where the 13 hours just flew by!

### "seated separately from my pregnant partner"
Non existent customer service. Had flight changed with misleading email titled seat change not flight change emails. Original flight was couple of hours layover in Incheon from Auckland, changed to 23 hour layover with no accommodation given just the lounge, seated separately from my pregnant partner on the flight, worse customer service. Better look for better airlines if you’re flying around Asia, better off with Air NZ or Singapore Air.

### "Check in and boarding very organized"
Not Verified | Very good flight. Check in and boarding very organized and with a lot of courtesy by the crew. In flight services very efficient, with the crew making sure safety requirements were met by all passengers and high level of attention to provide meals and beverages. In particular I appreciated the services and help I received for some additional requests I had. I definitely recommend this airline.

### "Very poor customer service"
Not Verified | Very poor customer service. Inflexible refund policy of $400 to cancel due to surgery. Kept on hold over one hour. The service reps were polite but kept saying the exact same thing over and over - were obviously reading a script. Will fly Air Canada and deal with Air Canada staff.

### "Service was consistent!
Service was consistent throughout the entire trip. Staff is kind at all times (ticketing, in-flight). The plane was nice and clean. They also served meal during this short trip.

### "impressed with the spacious cabin"
Smooth efficient (and friendly) check-in. Was first time with them and was impressed with the spacious cabin and the good seat-pitch on this red-eye flight. Before landing generous breakfast was served. Very polite and friendly crew.

### "never had an airline weigh my carry-ons"
I flew with my girlfriend with 2 carry-ons and 2 checked bags each. We expected to pay $100 for each of our second checked bags because that's what the website says. However, we found out while checking the bags that they only allow 10kg per carry on bag. So we ended up having to pay and extra $200 each (on top of the expected $100 each) to check our second carry-on bags since they were both over 10kg. I have never had an airline weigh my carry-ons before. We gave them our credit cards and then once they checked our bags, they told us we had to go to a different counter to pick up our cards. We went there and proceeded to wait for 45 minutes while they tried to charge our cards. There was no one waiting in front of us. It literally took them 4 staff members and 45 minutes to swipe 2 credit cards. They finally told us they would waive one of the $200 charges. We gladly accepted this and left to board. I found out later that they did actually charge us that $200 even though they said they wouldn't. I called Korean Air customer support about this and they told me I had to call a different number because the flight was partnered with Delta. The woman told me the number would work even though I am international. I called that number and it didn't go through even though I used the correct country code. I know they blocked me because the same phone number still works from my girlfriend's phone. Absolutely horrible. The flight attendants woke my girlfriend up to tell her to raise her seat during meal time. They also woke me up to ask if I wanted a meal on our second flight which was only 3.5 hours. It was already half-way through the flight. Don't wake your passengers for such silly reasons. Falling asleep on a flight is already difficult enough.

### "Poor reducing customer service2
No alcohol served to prevent spread of COVID. Yet duty free sales and gifts were fine. Items being given, credit cards and credit machines handled along with receipts. Poor reducing customer service using COVID as an excuse.

### "great for a 1 hour flight"
Not Verified | Seoul to Jeju. It was awesome. The check in area in Gimpo was busy as usual but crew were very nice and friendly. Seats were comfortable. There were separate entertainment screens but we could only use it on international flights. The flight was on schedule. Overall it was great for a 1 hour flight!

### "a nice flight overall"
Not Verified |  Recently flew from Phnom Penh to Washington via Seoul, in their "Prestige Class" (joined First and Business into one), the flight from Phnom Penh to Seoul, was approx 5 hours and none eventful (Slept most of the way), the flight from Seoul to Washington was a nice flight overall with one of the smoothest landing I have had in a number of years, well done captain. The crew is a different story, they have a preset menu, that includes steak, after ordering the steak medium rare (I understand English is a secondary language, but it took an effort to order including having to point at the menu for the item). Approx 10 min later they came back and told me that they had run out and I needed to order something else, a bit annoyed but I complied, I was in row 9, after the flight speaking with one of my traveling companions, the did the same thing to him and he was up in row 5 or 6. I had red wine with dinner, when the meal was complete my tray top was cleared, without even the offer of a refill on the wine, however I did notice that on the far side of the cabin they were walking up and down offer to that side. I know I could have requested a refill, but when you are paying full fare for round trip tickets (close to $12K) you shouldn't have too. If an item is offered on the menu, it should be available.

### "never by Korean Air again"
Not Verified |  I would like to thank Korean Air for providing me safe flight to meet my husband in LA. However, I’m very disappointed with cabin crew from Incheon airport to LA. I am a mother traveling with two girls. A 5 years old girl with slide behavior problems and a 2 and half years old girl. In the beginning of the flight itself one cabin crew with short hair came to instructed me to wear face mask for my babies. I did all the ways and try my best to put face mask on them as I also scare of the spreading to my little angels. (I am vaccinated and wear face mask in my entire flight). 11 hours flight 3 cabin crew came to wake me up to put face mask on my sleeping girls. I couldn’t count but 11 hours I couldn’t take even an hour rest. Before this flight I just take 5 hours flight from PP and layover almost 13 hours. I was extremely exhausted and couldn’t rest at all. The short hair cabin crew rudely tell me, it is my responsibility as a mother to make them wear face mask all the way, otherwise she would report to the police officer in the US that I break the law since US require child 2 years plus to put on face mask. I told her, I have tried but children feel uncomfortable and removed and screaming and crying. She told this is her duty to make my children wear face mask, I told her I completely understand her but what can I do if they scream and pulling it out each time I put it on. I told her I need rest please. I begged her to try to understand my situation but 3 of them didn’t let me rest at all. They try to read US law to my babies and took video of that, that the worst part I couldn’t bare. Finally we arrived the US pot, yes two police officers were waiting for us, I couldn’t go to the immigration check. Another Korean lady read what the cabin crew have note to the US officer, she even reported that my girl kick the front seat and trying to push and punched her. 2 police officer only asking, if the mother wear face mask, they say yes. Yes I did. Than they said what the problem. I can see their facial expression after hearing what such heartless carbine crew report. They have no problem at all because they understood that they are small kids. She was not satisfied, in between she came and complaining that my girl show violence on her. I told her I am sorry for her misbehavior but she was not even touch her. Then she look a bit ashamed and no words to say. I don’t blame the company but I blame to cabin crew who is heartless and stupidly trying to impress her boss how good she is. Finally, the Korea lady in the US airport understand my hard time so she help me to push my smaller baby through the immigration till the baggage claim. I thanks her for that but I swear I never by Korea Air again if I have options.

### "flight was one of the best"
Honolulu to Seoul-Incheon (proceeding to Hong Kong) in June 2019 - but I'm going to focus on the Honolulu - Seoul leg only for this review. This was my 7th flight on Korean Air - and all of this started on a very speedy, no-nonsense check-in process at Honolulu International Airport. The immigration checks were quick, and after a short bite, I went to the gate 2.5 hours before departure time. The boarding gate staffs were overall great - so does the cabin crews. I was welcomed in a friendly way. Upon reaching my seat, I figured out that my seat was comfortable in terms of legroom, with tons of features, but the seats were quite firm and hard, and there were several kid stickers that the cleaning crew had missed. Not a big deal for me. Throughout the entire flight, the crew kept on being friendly to me - they asked everything, even asking me if I have ever tried Bibimbap before - my 1st meal for the flight, which tasted very good. The 2nd meal of mine served before landing was beef with rice, which tasted good, but the meal presentation made me deny the 5-star rating. By this point, the crews were still very friendly but they couldn't hide the tiredness they had after the 9-hour journey (which is normal). The biggest blow of the flight was the IFE - hence why I didn't give this flight a 10/10. The IFE, for me, won in terms of responsiveness and layout, but the contents were very lacking, especially the movie section and music, with most of them being 13+ or 16+ contents, with only a few contents that were appropriate to be accessed by everyone. The saving grace of the IFE was the game sections and the onboard camera facility. Actual departure and landing time were pretty on time. In conclusion - apart from the IFE (which, according to their social media sites, has been renovated), this flight was one of the best (well, in fact, the best!) flights I've ever taken in 2019, with the crew becoming the shining stars of this flight.

### "will fly Korean Air whenever possible"
San Francisco to Clark via Incheon. It is really a great flight even if I only had to pay about 630$ round trip going to the Philippines. It is not a direct flight but it is more comfortable than the usual direct flight airlines that I take to go home to the Philippines. Their trays on the seats are less slippery and food trays have a stopper underneath to prevent it from sliding while eating. They serve with silver wares instead of plastic ones. Their food is really good. I had Bibimbap for dinner. Their attendants are so attentive and helpful. We travelled with our toddler and he wanted to walk around the plane but if I stop him he cries. Whenever he cries, the attendants approach us and play with my baby and walk him around the plane. Provides toys and something to keep the child busy. They never sleep throughout the flight. The bathroom has sensor faucets you don't have to touch or press anything unlike in other airlines. Their sink has automatic flush so water goes down while using it and doesn’t clog. Every time I used the bathroom, I noticed the tissue paper was folded like it was not used. They maintain their bathrooms clean and neat. Very helpful ground attendants too. I had a problem with our schedule so when I booked, I didn’t book return for my US national hubby and baby but they helped me be able to still make it to the flight and when we arrived in Korea and PI, some agents came to assist us making sure there wouldn’t be any problems at the immigration. Truly satisfied! From now on I will see to it I will fly Korean Air whenever possible.

### "300 USD for cancelling"
My family and I had a flight from Cebu to Dallas via Seoul on March 4, 2020 but due to the Corona Virus, we had to cancel. The customer service rep said they were going to charge us 300 USD for cancelling. I need more clarification about the refund process but I can't seem to connect to their US hotline. Sad. I love Korean Air. I always have a good experience with them but this really disappoints me.

### "On-time and friendly crew"
Kuala Lumpur to Atlanta via Seoul. On-time flight and friendly crew. All of our bags arrived safely at destination. We travelled with our 1 year old son, and with him in a carseat for the long-haul flight between KL and Seoul. The flight attendants wanted to see the airplane sticker on the seat but let us travel with it. We were in the cheap seats in the 3rd-to-last row in the back of the 747-8, in the middle. This airplane experiences a lot of yaw (side-to-side movement) during flight, so if you easily get airsick, I would not recommend sitting way in the back. There was not a ton of legroom but enough to not be uncomfortable. My butt got sore after a few hours in the seat, it is not well cushioned. You are provided with a pillow, blanket, and small amenity kit (cheap slippers and toothbrush). They provided us with 3 meals - a dinner, snack, and breakfast. The food was passable: they had chicken & rice, beef & rice, or beef & noodles on our flight. It came with a roll, dried pineapple and juice. They offer special meals for infants as well. There was no Wifi offered on this flight, and the inflight entertainment options were very few. There were some Korean movies and Western films but I only saw 2-3 movies I liked, which wasn't enough for a 12 hour flight. I've flown on the A350-900 on Delta on the way to KL, and there is a noticeable difference in the fatigue you feel afterwards. The 747-8 is large and spacious but doesn't pressurize as low as the A350, so you feel a lot more tired. Next time I'd definitely pick a 787 or A350 to go over the puddle.

### "certain tickets cannot book seats in advance"
A very full flight, as Korean has cancelled the daily flight on this route due to the virus. The crew did well trying to serve a meal and beverage service in 53 minutes. My only moan is that with Korean certain tickets cannot book seats in advance, I even went to the airport and was told no. With a virus around families need to sit together and not worry about being split up. Due to that attitude, my score reflects that.

### " Service on plane was nice"
Kuala Lumpur to Ulaanbaatar via Seoul in 2017. The staff was helpful with me from the moment I purchased the ticket at the airport office through cash (couldn't do it online as I did not have a credit card). I flew both legs on wide-body aircraft so seating was spacious and comfy even though there're many passenger. Service on plane was nice, cabin crew was helpful and responsive. Gave me lots of snacks whenever asked, served Extra hot meals. Refreshment and drink was great. I love their ice-cream! It's a decent experience after all, I had to flight late time and long transit time however can't complain anything with the service! Very happy and I'd love to try another route to Korea or take their Trans - Pacific routes to the US/Canada. My flight was back in Dec 2017. Couldn't choose the time as it can't be backdated more than 1 year.

### "The food was excellent"
Amsterdam to Seoul in business class. The seats are ok and good enough for a 2-2-2 configuration. The food was excellent, especially the Korean food that was served very authentically. English speaking of the cabin crew was not sufficient for an international flight. This should be improved to let the customer better communicate with the crew. Nevertheless cabin crew compensate that by high attention and very short response time. Infotainment was bad, choice of movies was very limited from the point of view of an European.

### "The service was amazing"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Vancouver via Seoul. First time flying with Korean Air and was quite pleased. The service was amazing. The flight attendants went above. It was a long haul flight and not one time did they lose their pleasantness. We were fed several times. Meals and drinks were included. Seat room was bigger than your usual economy seating. I will definitely be a returning customer.

### "my mother was refused boarding"
Not Verified |  Worse service ever. Booked my mother’s ticket from Fiji to London. Along the way Korean air stop operating from Fiji. I was just given flight from Sydney without a choice. I called them up saying that Sydney is a different country. Then I was given ticket from Nadi - Auckland - Seoul - London. On the day of the flight Korean air messes things up and my mother was refused boarding. We had to cancel the ticket and Korean air took USD 400 for the mess up they did. Their obligation was not fulfilled. Totally disgusting behaviour. Sent a feedback nothing happened.

### Korean Air customer review
Ho Chi Minh City to Seoul. An excruciating experience with a flight crew that was horrible to me, an atrocious lounge in Seoul, and a plane that looks like it has not been updated. My buttons on this dated aircraft didn't work. Even the divider between seats couldn't work because the button didn't function. The inflight entertainment is the worst I have seen. You see many flight attendants in the business cabin, as soon as the plane took off, they shut the curtains and I rarely saw them again. Forget about beverage service - one attendant said Korean Air's policy is to inquire about sobriety with every third refill of their thimble-sized glasses. I've never seen such an absurd policy and they enforced this. My food was mediocre at best. The lounges at Incheon look like a mall food court, are totally packed, and seemed outdated.

### "professional and attentive"
Not Verified |  We recently traveled to Bali and had a great trip. It was on the way home that we experienced the best ever experience of a crew member Junho, the the most professional and attentive flight attendant that I ever had. I am just amazed at an employee that takes this much pride in a job.

### "lost my wallet before boarding"
Seoul to Hong Kong. I lost my wallet right before boarding just outside the boarding gate but only realized towards the end of the flight. Upon leaving the aircraft, I sought help from crew. They were quick to refer me to the airport website and the airline website before ushering me off. Later confirmed that the airport was in possession of my wallet but needed some assistance or advice retrieving it. I called their customer service hotline which was received by an agent from the ticketing office in Malaysia, who told me that there was nothing they would do. The agent didn't have the knowledge or capacity to be of any assistance, but refused to let me speak to other staff in the airline who might have more of a clue. The airline is fine for getting from point A to B, but do not expect their staff to be of help if you need it. Also, customer support seems to ignores emails or are extremely slow at replying.

### "recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Irkutsk to Incheon. I enjoyed the in-flight entertainment and the seat comfort. The food was delicious and I had a great time. I was on a short flight, and the legroom was amazing! I would highly recommend this airline.

### "really enjoyed it"
Not Verified | London to Tokyo via Seoul. First time travelling on Korean Air - really enjoyed it. The flight crew were very friendly, professional and efficient. If I wanted cup noodles with a coke (with refills) gee did I get it quick and with pleasantry. Really thought they were great!

### "made me dislike this airline"
Seoul to Tokyo. Unprofessional and disappointing. Check in, boarding, and the beginning of the flight went smooth. The seats was comfortable with plenty of leg space. That was when things went downhill. My friends entertainment system wasn't working, and flight attendants ignore us despite us trying to get their attention. Food was bland and mushy. The head flight attendant was rushing to get food out, as she kept sighing and was rude, especially to the non Koreans. However, things started to go bad at the end of the flight. The plane had already landed and was slowly making its way to the terminal, when a little girl, about 3 years old, suddenly had to use the bathroom. The mum asked one of the flight attendant if her daughter could use the bathroom. The flight attendant went to ask her supervisor (who was the rude head flight attendant), to which she told the mum to tell her daughter to hold it. The daughter was crying, and kept saying how much it hurts (my friend who isn't Korean, but understands the language translated). The mum resorted to using a plastic bag for her daughter to uninate, in the middle of the plane. Of course, the little kid didn't want to, so the mum, desperate, just took her daughter to the bathroom. By this point, it's been 15 minutes since we've landed and was nowhere near the terminal. While I understand the importance of being in your seats while the plane is moving for our safety, certain protocol should be broken if there is a situation that arises. The head flight attendant on this flight, or at least in charge of my section, made me dislike this airline, which is disappointing as I've enjoyed this airline when I flew with them 10 days ago.

### "They insulted me in Korean"
Travelled business in 2014 with Korean/KLM to Europe and good experience. This time we had 3 business class tickets from Sydney to Amsterdam partnering with KLM - who were wonderful - and return Sydney via Rome with Korean. The flight crews were attentive but cold, clinical and lacking the human touch. The lounges at Incheon are a nightmare akin to two MacDonalds in different parts of the airport but overcrowded, full of screaming badly behaved children, and with poor quality food and beverages and lack of seating. The attendants at the lounge desk were like cardboard cutouts unhelpful and arrogant when I asked for shower access. They then insulted me in Korean, not knowing I speak it! I persisted and let them know in Korean that I understood their insult. I was finally pointed to the shower section and had a hurried shower. Finally, during our holiday a family member in Sydney became gravely ill and we attempted to alter our return dates to an earlier date. This was possibly the worst aspect of having to deal with the "customer service" operatives of this airline. Night after night we rang them and were drip fed information about seats available on given dates waiting for a date where we could get home. At least two of the male operatives were unbelievably rude to my wife when she spoke with them, talking over the top of her and there was no audio delay to justify such rude treatment. They offered us economy seats which my wife could not take as she has a medical condition that requires a sleeper or flat bed for long haul. We didn't get anywhere with them. On 22nd October, there were 3 unallocated business tickets available back to Sydney which would have got us back 5 days earlier but when we asked about these we were told because we'd paid a different fare schedule, we could not have them unless we paid an extra 3000 per ticket in Australian dollars or Euros. We paid approximately AUD 16,500 for the original tickets. We simply couldn't afford this so we were forced to wait for the originally ticketed flight later while we dealt with our anxieties about our sick family member in Sydney. Meantime, these people flew an aircraft from Rome to Sydney with 3 empty business class seats. This may be the corporate world model for aviation now but business still depends on goodwill and Korean Air have lost our goodwill forever. We will never fly them again under any circumstance, whether for work or pleasure. They are disgraceful in their treatment of passengers in need and not worth our custom.

### "flying Korean air next time"
Not Verified |  I recently flew Brisbane to London via Seoul with my family and we were put up overnight in the Grand hyatt at Seoul Incheon Airport. Very nice. i was impressed with the whole package: legroom, food, service. We will be flying with Korean air next time we jet off.

### "very pleased with Korean Air"
Frankfurt to Sydney via Seoul. We were very pleased with Korean Air. We flew from Sydney to Europe return via Seoul. On the way over to London Korean Air put us up at the Grand Hyatt in Seoul overnight. I recommend you ask your travel agent to ask for this option as it was fantastic. On our return trip we used the new transit lounge in Terminal 2 of Incheon airport which had showers, free internet and a 'sleep zone'. The airline experience itself was good. We experienced little turbulence on all flights. The food was good though they could improve their dinners (although the Korean bibimbap option was good - we all had it twice!) Breakfasts were better than good. The cabin crew were great and helpful when we requested additional snacks, water etc, although they served enough water to keep us hydrated. The hot towels before breakfast were also appreciated. My 13 year old son said the inflight entertainment could be improved although we thought it fine. Australians do not often fly Korean Air to Europe but I would recommend you consider it as an option.

### "This airline was disappointing"
I flew out from Brisbane, stopover at Seoul, before continuing to my destination Japan Tokyo. During this 13 hour trip I found this airline to the most disappointing so far in my travels. I have previously flown with Cathay, Thai and Malaysia and they've been pretty good (Cathay being the best in my opinion). This airline was disappointing because they always skimp on the water levels in their cups given out every time. I'm on a plane, that is the last thing that I need - to be even more dehydrated! To those people thinking of flying you are better off buying your own bottle of water before you go. Seats were uncomfortable and at a weird angle. For that reason I highly recommend choosing a different airline for long distance travel. Seats were also quite compact and not spacious. Inflight entertainment was average and on one of the planes its remote control was stuck to the screen with a wire. What I mean by that is that everytime your window seat buddy needed to go to the toilet and needed to pass me in the aisle seat, the wire was in the way making it a clumsy design. Food was very average. Never going to fly Korean Air again.

### "appreciate all their effort"
I was flying Korean Air from Jeju to Gimpo. My parents in law was catching another flight from Jeju to Shanghai with different airline. I got notified my parents in law flight got last minute cancelled due to weather issue.The Korean Air crew helped me to contact the other airline to find out what’s the issue and managed to reach my parents in law. The crew even lets us to cancel the existing flight back to gimpo so we can reunite with my parents in law outside the boarding area. I would like to thank you the Korean Air and the crew for your sincere help. I truly appreciate all their effort so we can settle our parents in law.

### "seats comfortable"
Tel Aviv to Seoul. Have flown this year with KE 3 times now. Our last flight with KE in August was the best. We are a family of 3 (baby 1 year old). Cabin crew was so nice and cared for us throughout the flight. We sat in the 2nd row of economy on one flight. I asked for cabin crew for something to drink which they said they have back in the galley (i told never mind and asked for something else). After finishing providing meals for others the staff came back especially with my drink. Check in was super fast on all flight, boarding on time, seats comfortable (I am a big guy) food was ok, movie selection changed on the 2 flights (so i had full new options to watch on both ways), flights on time.

### "The crew were unfriendly"
Honolulu to Singapore via Seoul. Delta put me on Korean Air as a codeshare flight. I last flew with Korean Air in 2010, and my impression after flying with them at that time was that it was fantastic, far better than most other airlines. Now, that impression is gone. Leg room was very good, entertainment ok although the range of movies is far more limited than Delta Studio. The crew were unfriendly and even borderline rude towards non-Korean passengers. I repeatedly observed them being very friendly and all smiles towards Korean passengers, however, the treatment towards non-Korean passengers was different. I believe this is because they felt more obliged to be courteous towards their local passengers. The biggest complaint I have though is the food. Food portions were terribly small and mostly tasteless. Halfway through the flight, I ate a sandwich which I purchased at the airport and flight attendant told me I was not allowed to eat outside food. This surprised me as I thought outside food was only not permitted only on budget carriers. Overall, it's still better than a 3-star airline, but there are now airlines out there that are better than Korean Air.

### "nothing very impressive"
Incheon to Bangkok. After flying from Hawaii to Bangkok several times with Korean Air, I can say that there is nothing very impressive about this airline. It's not that anything is especially awful, but it's my impression that the company and its personnel are several rungs below their competitors. They lack the charm, cleverness, efficiency, and poise of other airlines, and are often lax and simply sloppy. On one recent flight, a member of the cabin staff spilled a tray of drinks on me while he was serving them to other passengers; on another recent flight, I was exiting the toilet and a flight attendant was literally running up the aisle and ran straight into me and knocked me out of the way and, without stopping, yelled, "oops! and shrugged and carried on running. Their Thai staff are by far their best. Korean Air's catering is unappetizing, the interiors of their aircraft are uncomfortable, and their uniforms look something like pajamas. The entertainment on board is limited, dull and needs improvement fast and, most surprisingly for such a supposedly technologically-advanced country, Korean Air's website and app are clumsy and not at all user friendly. The airlines likes to make choosing a seat as difficult as possible and it's now only possible to do so when signed in as a member of the airline's frequent flier program, despite my preference for earning mileage with one of their codeshare partners. Does Korean Air know what codesharing actually is? Finally, Incheon airport is new, but beyond shopping there's actually not much to do and it's not very much fun. So, in short, nothing awful, but Korean Air is far, far behind ANA, JAL, EVA air, Thai Airways and Singapore Airlines, and can only really compete by being cheap.

### "overall poor customer service"
Hong Kong to Shenyang via Seoul. Korean Air has recently introduced a ridiculous policy of not allowing online or app-based seat changes (even for Biz class) unless you are a member of their program. Their response is it is a security issue. But it seems they just want to collect even more information than they already have and discourage your use of your other program membership, I am an elite Skyteam member via Delta, and all I want to do is change my seat. this is both pre and during online check-in. Really doesn't make sense. Thousands paid for the ticket and I can't even choose the seat I want. Very disappointing but inline with the overall poor customer service performance I am accustomed to receiving on Korean Air. I am not sure if they truly understand the concept of alliances and the purpose of sticking with an alliance like Skyteam. They really need to consider this poor service with their customers.

### "experience is bad"
Los Angeles to Bangkok via Seoul. Senior ground staff full of attitude. Traveling with pet did not get pre-boarding unlike other airlines have always given my special assistance. Cabin crew are ignorant. I asked for hot water and got refused by a crew member saying that “no, we don’t give hot water here”. I asked for a special meal and only got a meal with no drink. The cart came after and the crew skipped serving a drink to me as I assumed they think that I have gotten everything. Overall experience is bad since on-ground to onboard the aircraft.

### "experience onboard Korean was underwhelming"
The experience onboard Korean was underwhelming. Flew from DLC-ICN-LAX. The first leg was a quick hour flight onboard a 777 with good entertainment and was served a small lunch consisting of a chicken sandwich, pineapple and a beverage. The second leg was delayed for 1.5 hours after boarding due to technical issues. Leg space and seating on A380 was great, however I found the in-flight entertainment and meals subpar. The movie offerings were limited with a few new releases and between 15-20 old movies. Moreover, meals left a lot to be desired as the portions were small and snack options were limited to asian shrimp crackers, plain crackers and banana bread. Cabin stewardess did a fine job, going through the motions of carrying on their duties, but there wasn't any personal touch or personality to their interactions. I'd fly Korean Air again if the price is less than better competitors.

### "Tomato Soup for breakfast?"
Not Verified |  Excellent staff. However, Tomato Soup for breakfast? In general, the food is not good quality. Only a few very old movies for entertainment. Business Class Lounge was like being in McDonalds - noisy children, more people than seats, no bar service, dreadful food. Feel using the entire top level of a 380 for business class is not reflected in the facilities st Seoul. 16 hour layover, not permitted to take blanket from plane to “Nap Room”. The seats in the A380 are impossibly uncomfortable for sleeping

### "thank her for her amazing help"
Seoul to Sydney. I am a very nervous flier and I let the cabin crew know this. The first lady, who was showing customers to seats took this very seriously and was very welcoming and also checked up on me at the end and kindly wished me farewell. This lady assigned staff to look after me during the flight, Moon was the loveliest, kindest air hostess I have ever met. She stayed with me during bouts of turbulence (without neglecting her other hostess duties to other customers) and checked on me throughout the flight. She also distracted me by chatting to me about my time in Korea and assuring me that we were safe, as well as bringing me water and comforting me. I would love to be able to recommend her and thank her for her amazing help. Thank you Moon!

### "food was very good quality"
Paris to Seoul Incheon. First time flying in Korean Air business class with Prestige sleeper seats. The food was very good quality and the flight attendants were attentive and professional. I normally cannot sleep longer than 2 hours on a flight, but managed to get around 4-5 hours on the flight. The noise-cancelling headphones while not on par with Sony or Bose's top of the line models still worked well enough. IFE was good but not on par with Singapore Airlines or Emirates.

### "IFE screens were good"
Seoul to Madrid. The flight crew provided professional and courteous service. I like flying on the Boeing 787 and it did not disappoint. The  economy food is never a great quality for any airline, but it was adequate. One thing I like with Korean Air is that flight attendants always try to meet your request and on this flight was no exception. The new economy seats and IFE screens were good. IFE movie and TV show selection could be more extensive. As majority of Koreans fly on Korean Air if they had more Korean movies and TV shows, Korean passengers would appreciate that.

### "professional and courteous"
Sydney to Incheon. The flight crew provided professional and courteous service. One thing I like about A-330 plane is that seat configuration is 2-4-2 and my wife and I sat on the window side. The plane was clean and the seats were updated with 18.1" width and seat pitch better than other airlines. One area that is not as good as other airlines such as Singapore or Emirates is the IFE. The selection is still not as extensive as these top tier airlines. But, overall a good value travelling on long-distance flights to Europe. Good to note that as travel to Europe requires overnight stay in Incheon, Korean Air provides free hotel and food vouchers.

### "would recommend this airline as always"
Rome Fiumicino to Seoul Incheon with Korean Air. Overall, a great flight. I rode this flight yesterday (July 8th flight). The ground service? Fantastic because I was in business and at 6pm the check-in counter was open and I could check in within 10 minutes even though our family had 5 baggages (1 baggage / member) because of the great customer assistance. Then, I headed to the lounge. Better than Korean Air's own lounge in ICN. Have pizza, pasta, etc. Great. 10 out of 10. Now, the flight. Everything was great except for the IFE Selection. It was worse than my December 2018 Shanghai Pudong flight. Another Con: No inflight wifi. But I would recommend this airline as always.

### "seats are somewhat out of date"
Seoul to London. Pleasant in-flight attendants and good quality food. However, the seats are somewhat out of date and the airport check in staff, even in the Premium Check In Zone is very rude.

### "it's so hard to book with them"
Seoul to Bangkok. Generally, staff at Korean Air are good, food is pretty tasty and the onboard entertainment is varied but unfortunately gets interrupted all the time in 3 different languages. Strangely for a "technologically advanced" nation, they fall down on their website and general technology. Their website in Korea accepts Korean or International cards. If you're an expatriate, your Korean card won't work and if you use an International card you're likely to be singled out for fraud because (quite rightly) the credit card company won't share information with a vendor. The process to overcome this is to type your entire credit card number into their system to unlock your booking. The option not to do this is unavailable and no mention is made of what happens to this very private data once it's been entered into their system. Additionally, the company air miles system regularly doesn't recognise you've flown with Korean Air and the claims system makes absolutely no sense so I'd be surprised if I ever manage to claim. It's hard to give them a great rating when it's so hard to book with them and they're overpriced because the whole economy here is one big monopoly, but I've increased my score because their staff are goods.

### "very bothering experience"
Incheon to New York. I am a delta platinum medalion member so I am getting sky team elite plus status when I fly any skyteam. But quite a few Korean air staff are not aware of this. when I check in I'm eligible to use their business class counter but staff didn't know so I had to explain about this. Once they led me to morning calm counter (which belongs to their own membership system) and I'm not really morning calm member or anything. Yesterday when I was checking in, I knew I can check in three bags after checking allowance for sky team elite plus but they said I can check in only two bags then - when I ask them to double check they said I'm able to do so. It was very bothering experience every time I had to explain about their own  system? They even promote their strong alliance with Delta airline everywhere.

### "wouldn’t recommend it"
I was flying on business from Chicago to Korea. With the flight attendants its like they ask you a question and before you can answer, they’re already suggesting something else. Mind you, the flight wasn’t full so there’s no reason why they should rush. What really annoyed was when they started serving coffee and desert, they asked me if I wanted coffee or tea, instead I asked for water. To my dismay, the stewardess answered me don’t you have a bottled water provided for in your seat? I told her, I was saving it for the longer part of the trip so I wouldn’t have to bother her! Aside from the very limited options Korean Air is just a piece of work. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.

### "Cabin staff attentive"
Incheon to London Heathrow with Korean Air. Generally comfortable plane, given I'm 193cm. Felt I had just enough leg room. Food was good, with a choice between Korean and plainer options. Cabin staff attentive, polite and smiling throughout the flight. Was one of the best long-haul flights I've been on.

### "attentive but not so friendly"
Tokyo to Seoul. Check in is quick, seats are pretty good the only thing is that headphones and blankets are not available in the seats so you need to ask for some. The cabin crew are attentive but not so friendly, onboard meals are excellent but few movie options.

### "Other than the heat it’s fabulous"
San Francisco to Brisbane via Seoul. We love flying Korean Air, we try use it whenever we fly, the service and comfort and quality is outstanding and especially love the new windows that darken instead of the window screens. I only have one issue, since when did aircrafts allow heaters and for it to get so hot. My last couple of flights with Korean air, I became very faint because the air control is just way too hot! I had to fan myself and ask for cold drinks and if they can change the air temperature. I saw one man fanning himself too and a lady with an automatic fan hand held fan fanning herself. This makes the flight extremely uncomfortable and a little embarrassing when it’s such a long haul flight and your sitting in your own sweat because the temperature is too warm. This should be looked into as the aircraft provides blankets for people to use, so people should be able to use them right? I have walked off the aircraft today so uncomfortable and sweaty and quite faint throughout the flight which is a major concern for myself and others. Other than the heat it’s fabulous.

### "Horrendous problem solving"
Sapporo to Phuket via Seoul. Horrendous problem solving by the Korean Air team. We were left to wait on on the plane for 3.5 hours due to engine failure and upon reaching Seoul they didn't come up with any viable solution to replace our missed Korean Air connecting flight! Their solution in the end is to downgrade us all  from our original business class seating to economy. Even though my husband and I paid a  Business class ticket we had upgraded our small children using points from a paid economy ticket to business tickets. So we have now lost half a day for extra travel time. Since they are now rerouting us via Hong Kong 2) Insulted by the KoreanAir team by their Lack of acknowledgement of their Screw up and Our right to proper seatings. Absolutely no proper compensation for our loss on Business class tickets and Morning Calm mileage points. It's most shocking and mind you we are traveling with our very patient but very exhausted 6 year old twins!

### "the most excellent crew "
Honolulu to Incheon. I recently had the most excellent crew on a flight KEO54 on February 10,  they were proactive and attentive throughout the flight, showing me to my seat, assisting with storing bags, bringing me drinks.

### "recommend the airline"
Incheon to Auckland. I’m impressed with the way cabin crew serve me with veg meal when I told her that I’m a veggie. Crew was friendly, great food and for the service I would recommend the airline in future.

### "highly allergic to paint"
Los Angeles to Seoul. Within the first hour of the 13 hour flight I experienced a chemical smell that has caused a severe asthma attack. I am highly allergic to paint, smoke, toxic fumes from new carpet and strong chemical cleaning agents. I fly a lot and it is the first time experiencing an asthma attack of this magnitude.

### "Worst international airline"
Washington to Seoul. Worst international airline my wife and I have ever been on. We decided to choose Korean Air. I don't if it's only me but the seats feel smaller compare to other airline. The meals were okay, I would never give a bad review over the meals and seats size. Some staffs of the cabin crews were very unprofessional on handling there passenger, felt like they are talking down to their customer in economy class. Long story short, I do not recommend flying Korean Air, unless you have money for an upgrade.

### "Next trip with Korean air"
Seoul to Brisbane. I would like to comment on the high quality of service during the flight and especially mention one of the cabin crew who was most helpful (born professional) Thank you. Next trip with Korean air.

### "highly recommend Korean Air"
San Francisco to Seoul. My experience with Korean Air surpassed my expectations! The crew of flight KE 026 were kind, helpful, and very attentive. I highly recommend Korean Air to anyone who wants to have a great flight!

### "the coldest airport staff"
Seoul to Ho Chi Minh City. This is the coldest airport staff that I have ever met. Anyway aside from attitude, I have been flying with different airlines and usually they will let me check in my luggage as long as it does not exceed the weight limits. It happens that I brought along 2 small luggages this time. They only let me check in 1 luggage which weights less than 6kg (my entitlement is 23kg) and advise "have to pay for another one". I decided to hand carry the other luggage and ended up throwing away a few newly bought cosmetic as the airport guy does not let me bring to the plane. So I travelled all the way to Korea, pay for the goods and come back empty handed. Very good strategy the squeeze tourist money!

### "refused to even talk to me"
Seattle to Seoul. Refused to sell ticket for lap infant after they sold me ticket. Wouldn't refund transfer, nothing. Extremely rude, hung up on me, lied to me. Said I had to buy from Delta even though it was a Korean Air flight. Delta tried to help but couldn't. Lost out on my money for flight from Anchorage to Mongolia and back. Tried to fly and solve things in person. Alaska Airlines let me fly with my baby but Korean air refused to even talk to me. Threatened to call security. They also closed the gate early and turned people away. I suspect that it was overbooked but they refused to say. Claimed our connecting flight was too late and blamed Alaskan Air.

### "hardware was very dated"
Seoul to Kuala Lumpur. New aircraft but hardware was very dated. Seat is true-flat but not comfortable. In partially reclined position it provides no armrests. Tray table is unsupported and slants when the when the food tray is placed on it. A laptop will gradually slide off unless constantly repositioned. Window seats in the upper deck are more spacious than aisles which are constricted by walls and offer zero storage space accessible from the seat. The partition between seats is just plain awkward. Barely enough space to balance a drink precariously without deploying the slanted table. Pillow and blanket are economy standard, and not appropriate for overnight flights. IFE is substandard with few choices. Service is mediocre, hampered by poor English. Attendants have their rote routine but cannot cope with anything spontaneous like a change of wine with main course, water refills out of the designated timeframe, or drinks outside of regular service times.They are very polite but this does not translate into effective service. Ground staff at the Prestige check-in desk lack even this basic politeness, again, possibly because of a lack of linguistic skills in English. Wine selection is excellent but food is quite simply the worst I've had in a premium cabin of a full service carrier.

### "staff is efficient"
Seoul to Toronto. The staff is efficient, fast and friendly. The food is excellent. Korean air is my favorite one. Even the boarding is amazing.

### "Very sterile service"
Seats were very nice and comfortable. Flight Attendants were very standoffish and didn't seem warm or happy with their jobs. Smiles were forced. I asked for the steak on the menu and was later told that there is no steak and I was offered seafood. I said I didn't want seafood and was given a steak, oh well. Very sterile service and nothing like Philippine Airlines, which is outstanding. Service did compare with Delta Air Lines, who I took on the last leg of my trip. I think Korean Air is overrated.

### "Had a nice flight"
Not Verified |  Had a nice flight from Seoul Gimpo to Jeju Island and back with Korean Air. The planes were quite old, but neat and comfortable. Lots of legroom, many restrooms onboard. Good service both on the ground and in the air.

### "The leg room was spacious"
Los Angeles to Manila via Seoul. The check in process was seamless. I got the window seat that I wanted. The service provided by the crew was great. My 13-hour flight from LAX to ICN was so smooth that I got to sleep during the flight. The leg room was spacious which is very important for a long flight like this. The food was also delicious. Most Importantly, Korean Air allowed me to change my flight schedule without any fees. I had an awful experience with another airline when I tried to change my flight schedule but Korean Air did it without any hassle. I will definitely fly again with Korean Air.

### "team were really kind"
Really lovely team at Okayama who were so helpful and are a real credit to Korean Air. Thank you so much for all your help during our visit and in helping to sort out my luggage. The team were really kind and went beyond the call of duty.

### "make my two kids sit separately"
I had booked on Korean Air on 14th October 2018 to fly from Los Angeles to Seoul and Seoul to Singapore with my family. I had web checked-in inside the airport at 2pm for 11.30pm flight and was shocked to see that the seats were allotted in separate 4 different places. Then, I tried to find three seats together and one seat in between another passenger. Don't they have some common sense that how can I make my two kids sit separately and my wife separately for 20 hours journey. So, immediately I had asked the staff at 8pm once boarding pass was started. She simply replied that she cannot give 4 seats together. Then, I contacted the manager, and I requested him at least speak to the passenger to shift the seat to the next seat. He did not even have the courtesy to try and speak to the passenger. He bluntly refused without an attempt. Then, I spoke to the passenger in between my seats and he immediately accepted to change his seats.

### "the bad customer service"
My wife and I went to Incheon International Airport to do our check in, with more than 3 hours in advance and surprisingly, the gentleman on the counter told us that the only chance to seat together is on the middle seats on the combination 2-4-2. We asked how is that possible and he told us that most of the seats are reserved by travel agencies for honeymooners, then, they do seat separate? He said he cannot do anything. We looked for customer service from Korean Air on the new Terminal 2 but they don't have. Information told us to call to their call center. While waiting in from of the boarding gate, another couple were taking about they face same issue but they call their travel agency and after some complains Korean Air gave to then seats together. Lucky them! Once on board service was friendly, until on the second part of the flight, the route is Seoul-Colombo-Male, I asked one of the cabin crew if it is possible to get some instant noodles, he went to check and he said sorry we don't have, then my wife asked another cabin crew in Korean and she said sorry we don't serve on the second part of the flight because the flight is shorter. Excuse me, I am flying all the way from Seoul and you telling me I can have only on the first part of the trip even though you have it on the plane. Thank you Korean Air for the bad customer service.

### "worst flight I have experienced"
Denpasar to Dallas Ft Worth via Seoul. Absolutely, without a doubt the worst flight that I have experienced in the last 20 years. I am a pretty frequent flyer, and used to be a private pilot, so I make quite a few concessions as a customer for those reasons. Seat pitch was abysmal. I pretty much spent seven hours with my knees around my shoulders (I'm 6'4" tall) ended up getting the worst leg cramps because the seat-belt like was on for most of the flight, and we were told not to leave our seats. Plane was like a sauna. Really old A330 with no air vents available. It's bad enough doing long haul without having so sweat and then smell because of excessive heat and humidity as well. Cabin crew: This was unbelievable - a seven hour flight, in a hot aircraft, and the cabin crew sat down the back of the aircraft chatting away. Did not even serve any drinks, even a glass of OJ would have made me feel better. They finally decided to serve food and drinks five hours into a seven hour flight. How they get a rating of 8 out of 10 is beyond me.

### "a good experience"
Not Verified |  Seoul Incheon to Bangkok, I can confidently say I would fly Korean Air again. The experience was a little better than other airlines economy class that I have flown international. They served food and it was fine. Not great, but fine. There were plenty of options, including vegetarian and Bibimbap. They also came around with water and juice quite frequently. Pitch was pretty decent size. Seat was comfortable. Entertainment was sufficient, including Korean dramas. The only downside was the plane was pretty old. Definitely the oldest plane I have been on in a while. Pushing 25 years with very little updates from if I had to guess. Oh, and no wifi available. Overall a good experience, not great, but slightly above average. I have to rank slightly lower for no wifi.

### "travel with Korean Air again"
Taipei to San Francisco via Seoul Incheon. Very friendly crew, enjoyed my flight even with some delay at Incheon airport due to bad weather. The crew asked the passenger in the front to keep the chair straight during meals, which was very nice because when passengers ask each other, it doesn’t always work well. Will definitely travel with Korean Air again!

### "business class product is sub-par"
Auckland to Seoul. I found a lot of the business class service systems of Korean Air quite odd; whilst the crew were polite and responsive, they are working within a set system that means their business class product is sub-par. For example, your menu - which includes the wine list - is taken off you immediately after departure, so you cannot refer back to it. This makes ordering wine particularly difficult. Another thing is that if you order the Korean meal options, then you are deprived of the additional food - such as a soup starter, and bread - that people ordering Western meal options receive. They are not even offered, and as a result, I was starving after my small bowl of rice porridge; I've never been left hungry after a meal, even in Economy class. There was no indication of what snacks were on offer; luckily I was sitting next to a frequent flier and he kept ordering interesting snacks and so I followed suit. On a 12 hour, day-time flight, during which two meals were served, there were only two 'drink runs' by the crew - and they were both during the second meal service. I had to constantly request a drink, and at one stage even went to the galley to see what types of wine were available. I really didn't like this approach to service; I much rather have the drinks offered, rather than have to proactively request for them. However, this seems to be the way they do things - you won't be offered anything beyond the bare minimum, but staff are happy to respond if you do request things. The IFE was poor - a very limited selection of main-stream movies, and little in the way of reading materials. The seat was comfortable, and the cabin was spotless - including the toilets which were regularly cleaned. So whilst the hard product was good, and the service was polite and efficient, I really felt it was a 'bare bones' service culture and therefore, I did not feel pampered or spoilt, as I usually do in Business class. It really felt they were trying to minimise costs by keeping the food and drink away from the public eye.

### "worst customer service"
Manila to Los Angeles via Seoul. Our problem started when an aircraft had an emergency in manila and we missed our connecting flight in Seoul to LAX. Korean Air staff did not bother to pull some strings to assist us in making the flight. We even did not have our own check in as business class!! Korean Air  are on top of the worst customer service I have ever encountered.

### "I am very disappointed"
Manila to New York via Seoul. I am very disappointed with Korean Air. I am traveling with four kids ages 10 months, 5yrs, 10 yrs and 14yrs. Our flight from Manila to Korea got delayed which caused us to miss our connecting flight to New York. I spoke 4 times with their customer service to try and arrange a flight for my family and they are not accommodating at all. The best answer they can give me is go to the airport and talk to the desk and try to schedule a flight there cause they have more access. I explained to them that I have 8 luggage's and 4 kids which will make it very difficult to do that without a confirmed flight. I got so tired of begging and explaining to them the situation so I finally gave in and took a flight with a 10 hour lay over. The worst part of it all is I did not even ask for a hotel room. I just asked to be allowed to stay in the Korean Air lounge so that my kids can at least rest but they did not even give me that. My family and I travel every year and with this experience I highly doubt that Korean air will be on our list of Airlines choice. I don't agree with the saying customer are always right but I should not have to keep begging and explaining my situation with traveling with four kids.

### "staff are friendly"
Flew on a domestic flight from Busan to Jeju. Check in agents at Busan were amazing and their bosses allow them to have bubble tea at the counters. The lounge is rather small at Busan with only light snacks and soft drinks on offer, it is located before security. The staff are friendly, Qantas offer much better in their domestic lounges but one must realise Qantas charge much more for their J class product in comparison to Korean Air. The aircraft is an A330-300. The business class product is amazing, lots of extra leg room, if you want the most leg room, choose row 7. The flight attendants were exceptional in their customer service.

### "like the foods on board"
Manila to Toronto via Seoul Incheon. I like the foods on board, the service and entertainment. Also the amenities on board.

### "seats with unbelievable leg space"
I have traveled Korean Air many times and it is offering amazing Economy class product between Australia and Europe - seats with unbelievable leg space, nice catering, clean aircrafts, free 5-star hotel in Incheon on transit. Airbus 330 and Boeing 747-8 aircraft are very comfortable and friendly to Economy class guests. The only large disadvantage is that you can't upgrade to business with miles on the majority of fares.

### "utter lack of caring"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Bangkok via Seoul. I did not make to the Korean air portion of the flight, so this more about the service. Weather caused our American Airlines initial flight (all booked through the Korean Air website), to be delayed multiple times causing us to miss our connecting flight to Seoul and ultimately to Bangkok. Called the Korean air service line and they suggested requesting the gate agent to ask them to hold the flight. American agents said Korean does not do that. After calling both airline service lines and having close to an hour delay, they both said the other airlines had to change it. American was adamant this is a Korean ticket and only they can release to change. BTW, 2 kids under 5 that had been up since 4 am, so we were not in the mood to run around the airport. Chicago transfer agent K20 gate, wouldn’t let us transfer, so had to go out of security to get to terminal 5. So took the bus, with whole family in tow, to terminal 5. The Korean Air agents used very polite words to say it wasn’t their problem, they would not help and the best they could do was standby for tomorrow and since the flight was full, very unlikely to go tomorrow. That was the last straw. Helping me to resolve the problem is the job of the Korean Air service counter team, when I bought tickets from their company. The utter lack of caring or willingness to do anything amazed me. Korean Air lost a customer for life today. I had used Korean air for last 10+ years at least 2-3 round trips Asia a year. Will stick with someone else from now on.

### "friendly and personable"
Seoul Incheon to Amsterdam. I was satisfied with this flight overall. Check in process was friendly and efficient at Incheon airport, even though I arrived with less than an hour until departure. The seat was quite comfortable for a long trip, with plenty of leg room. I would say that the entertainment is not as good as on many other international airlines, but better than Asiana, with a reasonably interesting range of movies but a fairly lousy range of TV shows. I ordered a gluten free meal and was quite happy with the quality - probably one of the better GF meals I've had on a plane, but unfortunately Korean airlines don't seem to ever manage to provide GF bread. The range of drinks was okay, but again, I think it's smaller than many other international carriers, even in economy. The flight attendants serving my aisle were friendly and personable and made a real effort to interact with the passengers in a warm way - this was the most impressive part of the experience for me. Plane arrived on time in Paris and the toilets were kept clean for the whole trip.

### "nickel and dime culture"
Los Angeles to Chiang Mai via Seoul. We decided to spend a little bit more for our flight to Thailand in exchange for a better service and were disappointed: We could have saved several hundreds of dollars if we had used a Chinese budget airline. What was good about Korean Air were the flight attendants who were super friendly and helpful, on our return flight to LAX they even carried my carry on bag for me, when they saw that I was holding our baby. The reason why we won't fly with Korean Air anymore: I had ordered a "vegetarian oriental meal" (not vegan, but vegetarian which isn't as restrictive) What I received was a joke: it looked like someone had emptied half a can of peas into the aluminum container and thrown some bok choi leaves on top. No sauce, tofu, rice or potatoes. Horrible. My wife was still hungry after her meal and asked for a snack. The answer was: "we don't carry any snacks" (contrary to what their website says: "Snack Service A wide variety of snacks, such as samgak kimbop, cup ramen, pizza, and makkoli rice cakes, are served on long flights. The flight attendant explained: "we stopped offering cup ramen because of the smell" when my wife told him that she used to get ramen on previous flights. I had one can of beer at the beginning of the flight and ordered a gin tonic several hours later. This drink spilled because my table was defective (the kind which you pull out from the armrest). When I asked for another drink they watered it down and advised me "this is your last drink, each passenger is allowed to have only 3 drinks". I was not the slightest little bit drunken and very surprised because even on low budget airlines like Air India nobody told me how many drinks I could have. This is obviously a policy which is supposed to save the airline money. We both started to get a headache because of dehydration. When I asked for water, the flight attendant poured approximately 4 table spoons into a cup, I went back and forth several times between our seats and the pantry and each time they filled the cup only 50%. We were both thirsty during the entire flight. Before departure there was a bottle of water on each seat and as soon as the boarding was completed, they hurried to collect the water bottles from the vacant seats. (Probably in order to lock them up in the safe...) 5.) We had purchased an inflatable pillow which was specifically designed for air travel. As soon as my wife started to inflate the pillow, several flight attendants approached us saying that we were not allowed to use it. Obviously Korean Air's management made decisions in order to save money and we felt this nickel and dime culture during the entire trip. If we had chosen a low cost Chinese airline, we may have received some kind of rude treatment but enough to eat and drink for several hundred Dollars less.

### "Transit was a breeze"
I have flown with KE a few times now. This time around it was less than stellar. Arrived 3hrs and 30 minutes prior to departure. Well, check-in wasn’t a pleasant experience. It took me 1 hour to check in luggage due to the fact there was only 2 counters opened and there was a huge line to check in. Transit was a breeze and enjoyable due to the fact that Korean Air uses the new T2 in Incheon. The flight to JFK was good and comfortable, food was good. No complains here. Aside from the 1 hour check in, it was still a good experience. I have read bad reviews about seat comfort, but you get leg room which is around 33-34” and lets remember most airlines comes with a 31-32” leg room.

### "absence of footrest in economy"
Manila to New York via Seoul-Incheon. The aircraft was in excellent condition. The cabin was clean and smelling good and seats had ample leg room. IFE was okay but has limited selection. Food was above average but could taste better. Cabin crew are kind and warm but could've been more attentive to needs, as there was a point they stop delivering drinks (you know how it gets too dry in the throat during long-haul flights). My biggest concern with my flight was the absence of footrest in economy seats and perhaps the biggest factor why I'll rather fly Asiana in my next trip.

### "would fly Korean Air again"
Business class from Singapore to Seoul. We checked-in from terminal 4, there is an exclusive area in the lounge for first class passengers,. Food was below average, flight service and smile was good, IFE was acceptable, camera onboard was acceptable, and the seat was extremely comfortable on this 6 hour flight. I was disappointed though that no amenity kit was provided on this red-eye flight. We arrived at terminal 2 in Incheon airport where the experience was extremely positive for us compared to terminal 1. I would definitely fly Korean Air again. However, unfortunately they do not have routes to the Middle East.

### "I would fly with KE again"
Auckland to Osaka via Seoul. The leg room was impressive, I am 6'1 and can sit comfortably. Meal service was great. Crew was warm and with smiles. The only thing is that the In-flight entertainment system, compare to CX and NZ, the choices of the movies were limited. Nevertheless, I would fly with KE again for sure.

### "not use this airline again"
Seoul to Tokyo Narita. I use my mom's credit card to buy my flight ticket. But, When I was check in at the counter in Incheon, They required me to show my mom's credit card, if not I need to buy a new ticket again (refund for old ticket). Because I study in Seoul and my mom is in Thailand, it is impossible to show them. But, I asked other friends who also use their's parents card to buy, they doent need to show the card. So it is kinda confuse me. Also, The flight was delay for 1 hour too Anyways, I really hate this process and it quite annoying, I will not use this airline again in the future.

### "the food was below par"
Singapore to Seoul. Flight arrived either early or on time. However, I had selected my seats for both legs, immediately after I bought the tickets online (via Korean Air website). On both legs, our seats were assigned to worse options. The Singapore-Seoul leg, we were given seats further back on the aircraft. I chose front rows as we didn't have check in luggage and therefore, could clear the airport quicker. The Seoul-Singapore leg, not only were our seats reassigned but we were separated. At the check in counter at the airport, the clerk managed to get us two seats together. However, we were wedged between two other passengers making it a tight squeeze. I had selected two seats together - the aircraft to Seoul had better seat configuration and leg space. While they had 3 options to choose from, the food on both legs was below par. Even low cost carriers give better quality food.

### "never recommend flying Korean Air"
Vancouver to Cebu via Seoul. We’ve flown with Korean air before and received services for their 12 hour layover in Incheon without issue. We paid more to book with them this time and now they’re refusing to honour the layover service due to a block out period. We would’ve never booked a flight that has a 12hr layover knowing that there wouldn’t be a layover service. When I tried to call they half listened and kept repeating “no”. I would never recommend flying with Korean Air anymore. It’s really not worth it to pay more to have such a long layover when other airlines have cheaper flights with much shorter layovers. Initially they told us that they offered the services to offset the long layover in comparison to other airlines but now they’ve reneged on that, there’s no benefit to flying with them anymore. If they would’ve been even a bit more polite and accommodating to our concerns, I wouldn’t be writing this review but when I asked them what they would recommend us to do on our 12 hour layover, they said “I don’t know”.

### "aircraft was new and comfy"
Taipei to Seoul. The stewardesses were  polite, and helpful. I was surprised by the comparative good quality of meals they provided for a less than 3 hour flight from Taipei to Seoul -- with metal cutlery. The aircraft was new and comfy with many entertainment choices. You don't need to beg for pillows or blankets - these were automatically provided to you. Their ground staff in Seoul do need to improve their English skills if they want to attract more international travelers.

### "polite, helpful, and nice"
Seoul to Beijing. I wanted to say thank you for your wonderful employees at the check-in and help desk. I had a problem with my flight, and they assisted me from start to finish while being polite, helpful, and nice. They made my situation into a less stressful situation.

### "It was a nice experience"
Ho Chi Minh to Seattle via Incheon. It was a nice experience, great legroom on economy seats and the recline is pretty good. The food was excellent, I love the Korean Bibimpap they served. The cabin crew really inactive, they were very lazy to clean passenger's trash, although it was in their sight and very obvious. They should also have more bathrooms or let economy passenger use their premium class bathroom because most of the time it was not occupied.

### "a pathetic experience"
It was an international travel from Fukuoka (Japan) to Delhi (India) via Seoul (South Korea) with Korean Air. Due to the bad weather condition, the airline was kept on postponing the estimated time of departure in Fukuoka (Japan) Airport. The flight from Fukuoka to Seoul was 5.30 hours delayed approximately. During that time the staff at Fukuoka airport provided a can of coffee and nothing else. Anyway, I was worried since I needed to board another Korean Air flight from Seoul to Delhi. Unfortunately, I couldn't board that flight. I contacted airlines staff and the staff suggested for me to take the next days flight from Seoul to Delhi. The staff happily showed incapability to provide any lounge/hotel for one night stay as well. I was supposed to reach Seoul in afternoon but landed late evening. I was completely exhausted and hungry also knowing that I needed to spend one night and a day until the afternoon (15 hours approximately) before boarding the flight to Delhi. Now, the flight to Delhi kept being postponed. During this time period, I contacted airport enquiries and tried to contact airline staff but couldn't find the airline staff. The airline didn't provide any food since they didn't bother to contact me at all. Note that the flight which was supposed to take off in the afternoon was finally rescheduled to 20.00 hours approximately which made my spend 24 hours at Incheon Airport (Seoul) approximately. It was indeed a pathetic experience and I was left with no energy. The airline should treat the passenger properly and also provide accommodation if flights are rescheduled. I would definitely not recommended Korean Air to anyone.

### "perfect cabin crew"
San Francisco to Jakarta via Incheon. To be clear, the prestige class cabins in Korean are not cutting edge, they aren't the best in the skies. Infact, the seat width are quite narrow, and could be noticed when trying to stretch out. Though, while they lack on the hard product, they throw all this over with their soft product. The cabin crew were very disciplined and very friendly. They did speak perfect English and did go around the cabin a lot to make sure if anyone needs a drink or would like some freshly baked cookies that they have just made (they were excellent). They had excellent food and a lot of it. They were all cooked to perfection, both the Korean and Western meals. Although I would recommend the Korean dishes because they are after all, a Korean Airline. IFE is acceptable with new movies and a good airshow that worked, so no complaints there. Overall, Korean Air has reasonable fares from Asia to North America and is worth the price. Even though the seat is not cutting edge, you will be able to sleep (especially because of food coma). I do not have enough words to express just how perfect the cabin crew were, and they made the whole experience worthy.

### "FA's polite and attentive"
New York JFK to Manila via Incheon. This is really a great flight for me, the food was delicious and the FA's are pretty, polite and attentive to my needs. We were on time in the departure. I have no complaints of Korean Air. My Seoul to Manila flight was excellent with an on time performance and I loved the ice cream. The snacks were really great and they served hot snacks.

### "Service was inexcusable"
New York JFK to Shanghai via Seoul. The 747-800 is an excellent plane and the new Korean Air business configuration is comfortable. The rest of my most recent KE travel was ridiculous. Checking in to a disinterested Prestige class desk, I was told they had no record of the 3rd leg of my flight. She was happy to leave it there quite unconcerned, if or when my luggage would reach KK but with much prodding found a manager who eventually rectified that issue, much stress pre-boarding from a Delta partner. No cocktails were offered. The meal was so small and of such poor quality that I was shocked. Wine in the regular tiny glasses was offered once after meal, the fruit (only dessert) was as unripe and as unappealing as was the disinterested service. Since they offer virtually no snacks on the 14 hour flight in Business class, I requested some more food and was given an old chicken sandwich on raisin bread which was probably crew food. I was asked if I wanted to be awakened for the second meal "2 hours before landing" - yes! When the lights went up and the loud service began I thought I slept well and was near landing, however breakfast was served in a fully lit cabin 4.5 hours before arrival, also, small and uninteresting - then duty free shopping was announced and flouted. Then after all were awake lights went out for 2 hours before landing. Service was inexcusable, especially the lack of water. At one point I was told they were out of water but someone found a bottle. The FA's were just not interested in a smile or any effort to make me feel welcome. The purser was unconcerned about my issues and explained this was the normal flight plan. Since he and the cabin crew have little conversational English ability, I was lost. The flight from Incheon to Pudong was much better. There are myriad choices transpacific and KE should not be considered for Business class fares. Flight 086 on Jan 9 2018 was a true disgrace to what may be considered a reputable airline.

### "never travel with Korean Air again"
Seoul to Amsterdam. When we travel as a family, they should have knowledge and control over which seat to be given. They prioritise their home citizens first. When asked nicely if they could change it or move some passengers, they just replied "not possible". Worst airline ever attended. As a family we have never experienced a airline which gave seats 1 by 1 when we are a family. Therefore we will never travel with Korean Air again.

### "a very good experience"
Frankfurt to Shanghai via Seoul. One of the best business seats I have experienced. Check in in Frankfurt went smoothly. The lounge was ok but nothing special. Had a seat at upper deck of Boeing 747-8 at the window. Spacious with privacy and a nice HD monitor, it was full flat bed. Staff was extremely helpful and competent. Food was ok with a choice of western and Korean food. Flight was in time. Transfer in Incheon was uncomplicated, the lounge there could be better. Quiet poor choice of food, but the lounge had a smoking room and draft beer. Flight from ICN to PVG was also nice business class experience, especially when considering that this was just a good hour flight. Return flight had same standard. Overall a very good experience.

### "unpleasant one to travel with"
Los Angeles to Incheon. The booking, check in and website infrastructure/system are very frustrating and error prone. I have been on multiple flights with them and almost missed a flight because my boarding pass would not scan at the gate. Recently my flight was delayed because people had trouble boarding at the gate as well. Checking in on their website has been an issue because the information requested had no entry field. Checking in at the kiosk at the airport printed all of my fellow travelers boarding passes but only 1 of mine. When I tried to check in to print the rest of mine it errored out and I had to wait for the check in time for my flight at the korean air counter so a person could fix it. A lot of small annoyances add up to make this airline an unpleasant one to travel with. Also the seats on their smaller planes are concave and incredibly uncomfortable. The bigger planes are better.

### "I had a positive experience"
Seoul to Moscow. I had a positive experience with Korean Air. Cabin crew was helpful and gentle, food was quite ok, IFE had the biggest screen I had seen. The film choice was not as big as in other airlines but I found many good titles to watch. The seat was really comfortable with loads of room for my legs. The only minus was the ground service. Baggage drop was really long and chaotic.

### "food was of good standard"
Seoul to Prague. Check in very fast. Was seated in the upper deck of the 747-8i. Amazing aircraft, the prestige suites are very private, and the extra storage along the window is most welcome. The cabin was spotlessly clean, and two bathrooms upstairs is a plus as most airlines only have one. Cabin Crew are very professional and friendly, and always immaculately presented. The food was of good standard. The entertainment is a bit limited, however that doesn't really bother me as I do not use the IFE that much. ICN is a great airport, although the Korean air lounge isn't really worth a visit, they should invest more into their lounges. Overall a great experience, Korean Air is one of the more premium airlines to fly.

### "Worst flight experience ever"
Seoul to Manila. Worst flight experience ever. You go to the gate they told you at the checking in counter and when you are there; no program, no sign, nothing. When I went to the Korean Air customer service they told me after a 3 hour waiting line, that the flight will leave 5 hours later then expected. When we are 5 hours later, still no plan and again waiting for hours. This all without any information, or announcements. They also didn't offer a voucher for even a meal. Also not giving any option by claiming costs. This whole combination, I haven't ever experienced it ever before. Third world countries experiencing typhoons manage the airplanes and communication better.

### "recommend to avoid this airline"
Seoul to Kathmandu. First was told 3 hour delay due to technical difficulties then further 2 hr delay due to same reason. When asked, no proper reasoning was provided. All was said was sorry. I find sorry as a very inadequate answer to such a huge problem. Lack of proper answer and reasoning to delay from airlines authority was more than aggravating. No compensation whatsoever and shady reasoning gives me enough reason to avoid this airlines in my future travel. And would strongly recommend others to avoid this airline.

### "failed to inform passengers"
San Francisco to Tokyo via Seoul. The flight from Seoul to Tokyo Haneda delayed 3 times so far. The airline failed to inform passengers as soon as they knew about a delay. The first delay I found out at the boarding gate near the scheduled boarding time - 3 hour delay. The second delay was known 30 minutes after the boarding time, after we pressed an airline employee to find out, while he appeared to be running away - another 3 hour delay. The third delay is announced at the boarding time, unknown how long until further notice. To their credit, they gave out bottled water once during this long, frustrating process. But nothing else, no explanation, no other accommodation. Some local passengers were yelling, many lied around trying to get some sleep. Inquiries made in English were met with very limited response. We were not given a chance to plan for alternatives, with the late announcements or lack of transparency. We are still waiting.

### "they are very robotic"
San Francisco to Mumbai via Seoul. This is a cheaper option to travel to India. Also since the flights are approx. 12 and 10 hours duration, it doesn't become very tiring towards the end. However they have flights only thrice , week. This is the second time I flew with them. The San Francisco to Seoul flight has more legroom but to Mumbai just cramps everyone. I have tried both Indian non veg/veg and regular flight food and found both quite good. However their portion size is very small. And they don't have much snack options like banana or chips available like in other flights. So I ended up being hungry all the time and literally waiting for food. Economy class service is just Ok. The crew is not bad but like someone said they are very robotic and no warmth at all. And one or two can be rude too. IFE is bad, very limited and boring options. Also despite chunk of passengers being from India, they don't offer any Indian entertainment. Still its a value for money courier. But given a choice of same airfare I would prefer another airline.

### "all of their four legs was delayed"
Dallas Ft Worth to Ho Chi Minh City via Seoul. This is the first time I fly Korean air and all of their four legs was delayed. Pretty lousy statistics, I should say. It certainly doesn’t help when your flights are so long and you want to just get through it as quickly as possible. On top of that I was placed in the last row by the bathroom for the nearly 20 hrs flight home. Fortunately I was able to change the seats by going to the airport ticket counter the night before. For the 15 hrs flight from TX to Seoul, only two meals were served. Boy! I was very hungry so on my return flight I packed extra food. Suffice to say future flying with Korean Air will be rather unlikely.

### "flight attendants were terrible"
Bangkok to Atlanta via Seoul. My husband booked my flight on Korean Air because of the reputation for great customer service. My husband and I have previously had excellent service when we traveled in coach class. However, my  flight in Prestige Class was very disappointing. The customer service by the flight attendants on all flights was below average. I was expecting a lot more in Prestige Class. On previous flights, we have been treated much better in coach. I selected a noodle dish on KE 035 which was served with ice cubes floating in the bowl. I had to ask for water since the flight attendant rarely came by to ask if anything was needed. On my return (KE 036), I asked for bread but was told "no" since bread didn't come with my choice of meal. The flight attendant later returned with bread. On flight KE 659, I had to ask for a bottle of water but was told the flight didn't have bottled water. They served me a very small glass of water but didn't come back to see if I needed more water...I had to ask. I find it appalling Korean Air didn't have bottled water. On the same flight, the meal I selected was not good so I ask if I could have the noodle dish. I was shocked when the flight attendant brought me a bag of dried noodles and hot water. I don't know what happened to the excellent customer service experienced on previous flights but my entire flight was not worth the money spent on my Prestige Class ticket. This will be the last time I will ever book a flight on Korean Air. Food was terrible, flight attendants were terrible, the entertainment consisted of very old movies and overall experience was absolutely terrible. Overall rating...less than 1 star. Additionally, the Korean Air lounge at Incheon Airport was absolutely disgusting.

### "level of personalized service"
JeJu Island to Seoul via Degeau. My wife and I made a mistakes flying from JeJu Island to Seoul by scheduling an impossibly short connection time. The ticket agent recognized this and gave us new seats that allowed us to get off of the plane before other coach passengers, notified the flight attendants that we had a too-short connection who arranged for our checked luggage to come off the conveyor belt first and opened up a baggage check-in lane for us only and our baggage that needed to be re-checked. We made our connection and our luggage arrived with our flight at our final destination. In my wildest dreams I could not imagine this level of personalized service from a US domestic airline. Korea Air deserves more a 10, the highest number on the rating.

### "not fly them again by choice."
Bali Denpasar to Seoul Incheon. Check-in was fast and easy by Korean's contracted ground handlers in Denpasar. The flight boarded and pushed back on-time. While the flight overall was fairly comfortable (good seat pitch, good seat-back inflight entertainment, pillow & blanket provided), Korean's cabin crew are very cold and without any personality. They are very robotic in everything they do. The cabin crew was very unfriendly and disingenuous while attending to the passengers - forced, half-smiles when serving the meal and drink service (the breakfast served - was soggy and virtually inedible). This is such a shame because they are dressed to impress and fly onboard such nice airplanes. If only they provided warm, caring hospitality, they would truly be an outstanding airline. Until then, I would not fly on them again by choice.

### "good value for money"
Bangkok to Seoul. A330 Outbound on time, return A380 30 mins late departing. Both planes clean. crew attentive and smart appearance. Food excellent and choice of three main courses; fish on return not served warm enough (below 60c). IFE okay; reasonable choice but not extensive so being marketed as 'Beyond Entertainment' is somewhat misleading. Delay in accepting commands on screen is annoying. Advertisement for Winter Olympics prior to every show or film gets repetitive; Korean Air should proof watch this 50 times to see what their passengers put up with. Overall good value for money. A380 return too hot in economy.

### Korean Air customer review
Bangkok to Seoul. We would like to express our appreciation to the cabin staff 24 November 2017. We had an issue with the television during the flight. Once we informed her, she actively tried to coordinate with related people to solve the issue and keep us informed on the progress. Moreover, she came to us and explained the safety demonstration personally. This shows great service as a cabin crew. We really appreciated her kindness and support.

### "comfortable seat with ample leg space"
Flew Incheon to Singapore. The best thing that Korean Air offered was a rather comfortable seat with ample leg space. Inflight entertainment and food were decent, albeit not the best. Flight attendants were rather polite and helpful, although I was rather unhappy that the flight attendant serving me failed to enquire me on my preferred choice for dinner. There were 3 meal options - A, B, and C. For option B, we could choose between beef and chicken. Instead of listing them out for me, like she did for the passengers next to me, the attendant took the shortcut by asking if I was okay with option B. On hearing yes, she handed me a serving of option B with chicken in it, showing no interest at all that I might be more keen on having beef instead.

### "the worst that I have ever flown"
New York JFK to Seoul. Do not fly Korean Air business class, it is laid out like coach. What a disaster, 16 hours with someone snoring an inch away. Their business class is the worst that I have ever flown! Do not fly this airline. You are paying way too much for a coach seat!! !

### "commend the flight attendants"
Seoul to Honolulu. I want to commend the flight attendants for handling a unruly passenger on a flight to Honolulu. A young lady wanted the whole row of empty unassigned seats at the rear of the airplane because she wanted to sleep during the flight, but there was an older woman already seated there. When I boarded she was sitting with her friend a few seats forward then when she got up to move the older lady was already there. This young girl made such a fuss about her wanting the seat before the other lady. The flight Attendants asked her to sit down because she was delaying takeoff. The flight attendants finally got the old woman another seat  and let the young girl have her seats. A flight officer from the cockpit came out to see what the delay was. The flight attendants did right by defusing the situation and dealing with it so the plane could take off.

### "Seats still extremely spacious with leg room"
Always fly Korean Air nonstop when I visit friends and family in Atlanta. Last trip 2015. Used Gangnam City Terminal checkin which allowed for expedited security at ICN. At ATL, checkin is always hassle free with no wait when you use the web check in line. Seats still extremely spacious with leg room, flexible headrest and recline. I managed to sleep 7-8 hours in both directions! Cabin spotless. Crew friendly, professional and polite in both English and Korean. Entertainment options are a bit lacking, honestly. Oddly, only four Korean movies. Food quality (Korean choices) are tasty, too.

### "totally unacceptable service "
Seoul to Hanoi. I wish to register my absolute disgust at the totally unacceptable service I received from Korean Air staff at Incheon Airport on September 1st 2017. I was told I have to line up and self check in, which does not work, it worked but not fully, it recognized my Passport but would not allow me to check in as it could not verify my Visa. So I was asked to check in at a checkin desk. So back to the Line once more. This was now the 2nd Person from Korean Air I spoke with she told me must join this Line, I explained the issue she told me this line this line, I asked again this is for Hanoi yes join this line. So  after 45 minutes I get to the initial entry Ropes of the Check in and am told wrong gate wrong gate, I again tried to explain my concern and issue and was ushered away in a dismissive manner. I then asked another Staff member and still getting any assistance or good feeling whatsoever that I am going to successfully check in. I asked this lady sure this is the line for Hanoi, if this is the line there is no way I can make the flight in time this is now the third line I have been told to join. Do not worry she said no issue you will make it. At 7.50 I have still not checked in and see no way in making my flight and I will not be able to make my appointment in Vietnam thru no fault of my own and what appears to be absolutely no concern from the Korean Air Staff on the Ground. I do not speak Korean so I am automatically dismissed. At 8.00am my Korean Colleagues who had none of the hassles I had as their passports were accepted without Visas spoke to one of the Korean Air Staff who escorted me to a check in desk and personally checked me in. I just made the Flight. I have never in all my years of travelling been so poorly treated. I am still waiting for a Reply from KE Customer Service to my email of Sept 7th 017

### "Reasonable price too"
Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo via Incheon. Fast service, very friendly cabin staff. Staff walking around so easy to call for requests or questions. Love their seat, wide, large legroom, the most comfortable for me. IFE for NRT-KUL not really good as the KUL-NRT. The pouches with Pyeonchang Winter Olympic logo which has slipppers and toothbrush were given for night flight; was a good souvenir from KE. Would like to travel with KE in future too. Reasonable price too.

### "pleasant flight overall"
Seoul to Taipei. This is the first time I flew Korean Air after many years and it seems to be a much better airline now. Ground staff was very polite and helpful. Ground and onboard staff were very courteous with a smile on their faces. The plane was clean and relatively comfortable. Food was a bit bland and quantity was a little lacking, but okay for a short flight. Entertainment service was a bit unreliable, with few of the functions on the remote not working well. Very smooth and pleasant flight overall.

### "terrible experience with Korean Air"
Seattle to Hanoi via Seoul. I had a terrible experience with Korean Air. My flight from Seattle to Seoul was delayed by 1 hour, but this wasn't a problem because I checked in online and as was written in my document, I didn't need to check in again at the airport. I had only a carry on luggage so I went straight to security. After waiting for 45 min in line, I was told that my boarding pass barcode is not working and that I needed to go back to the Korean Air counter at SeaTac. I quickly headed towards the counter only to learn that there was no one there. Usually they close 1 hour prior to departure but because the flight was delayed there was nobody there 1.5 hours prior. I've asked everyone I could possibly ask to find a Korean Air representative, this was unsuccessful. I went to the kiosk to reprint a boarding pass - the system was down! I wasn't recognizing my ticket number, passport or booking number. I cant believe I couldn't make it to the other side to make my flight! As a result, I was rebooked to a later, longer flight with 2 stops instead of one through Las Vegas. I lost a 1 night stay at an expensive hotel in Hanoi, a day tour to Halong Bay and no one at Korean Air seemed to care!! I could not find one person who could help me in any way. Never again.

### "Seat wise it was comfortable"
Cebu to Seoul Incheon on a Boeing 777. Seat wise it was comfortable with enough leg space. For a four hour flight to Incheon it felt good, with good service, good food, and IFE! For the price, it was a very good deal in my opinion. Check in was a breeze in Cebu. Even was lucky enough to get bulk head seats. Luggage was checked through so, it was really nice.

### "service was good as always"
Flew Korean Air from Seoul Incheon to Nadi. The service was good as always. The flight takes almost 10 hours and the flight attendants did a really good job for the whole flight. Service in Incheon airport is good as always. The food was pretty good. The drinks were served frequently. Airplanes were new and clean on both ways. Seats are as comfortable as they can be in Economy class. The movie choice in IFE is not so great, but acceptable. Had a pleasant flight.

### "the meaning of customer service"
My husband, grandson and myself recently flew Auckland to London return via Seoul. We had made this trip on Korean Air on two previous occasions, and once again enjoyed the complimentary night's accomodation at the 5 star Grand Hyatt at Incheon, which also included a delicious dinner and breakfast. Korean Air is a most generous airline, in terms of legroom in their economy class and the overnight stopover they provide on the Auckland to London flight. What particularly impressed us this trip was the trouble the ground staff went to locate and then hand deliver the wallet my grandson left onboard the aircraft when we landed in Seoul on the homeward leg. It was only when we checked in for the last leg of the flight to Auckland, after a three day stopover in Seoul that he mentioned the wallet was missing. The young lady at check in made a series of phone calls, located the wallet and arranged for it to be delivered to the departure lounge. Korean Air certainly understand the meaning of customer service.

### "crew were very attentive"
Beijing to Washington via Seoul. From helpful ground staff to the inflight service I cannot praise this airline enough. I was surprised by the amount of legroom in economy, I'm 6ft but I still had a couple inches of legroom. The food was excellent with the flight from Seoul to Dulles getting two full meal services with real cutlery. The crew were very attentive and active throughout most of the flight, going through the cabin to collect trash and see if the passengers needed anything. The one downside is the amount of entertainment compared to Emirates but the movies they did have were superb and the IFE was very responsive. I will be using this airline again in the future.

### "flight crew was excellent"
Seoul to Rome. Check-in staff courteous and helpful, particularly with seat allocation and check-in of baggage through to my ultimate destination. Queue at check-in long so the wait time was quite long. The service by the flight crew was excellent - friendly and courteous. Food choices were good (three mains) but the Korean meal (spicy octopus) was a little too spicy and I would have preferred a bibimbap. The plane was well maintained, clean and fairly new.

### "best four flights I have ever been on"
My wife and I flew to London and returned with Korean Air from Sydney via Seoul, Incheon. KAL was the best value ticket available and included a complimentary night in Incheon on the outward leg of our journey. The quality of the accomodation was 5 star and beyond expectation. In total we had four flights two on Airbus 350 and one on a 747 and one on the A380. The Airbus are all newer aircraft and offer an exceptional flying experience. The 747 was noisier, but the cabin had been retro fitted to a consistent level of quality. The seats in economy are a calm blue or brown colour, are the widest I have experienced in economy and offered ample leg room for my 6ft 2 frame, even when fully reclined. There are no obtrusive underseat boxes. The touch screen inflight entertainment screens are large and offer a cosmopolitan selection which although not as big as some, has something for everyone. Every seat has a point where you can charge your devices, but there is no wifi in economy. There were little bottles of water and headsets on the seats pre boarding. The crew are all impeccably presented in a beautiful cream and green uniform that is a nod to Korean celadon ceramic wear. The food is exceptional if you like the Korean option with the signature dish of bibimbap and doesn't even look like airline food. The western choices are more standard airline presentation. Our son received child's meals and these were colourful and provided a variety of healthy items and sugary treats to suit all levels of fussy. The children's headsets are so cool I was jealous. The boarding procedure was straightforward and we were priority boarded ex Seoul due to travelling with children. The toilets in economy contain high quality branded toiletries and were kept meticulously clean on all flights with crew stationed outside through the quiet times of the flight. The crew themselves were highly professional and had good English. They were attentive to call bells and helpful when asked questions. They are impressively patient with passengers who misunderstand cabin protocol or ignore the seatbelt signs and manage the safety in a charming and caring way, rather than a bossy aggressive manner that can occur on western airlines. On the A380 there is an actual duty free shop at the rear. I have no complaints whatsoever. These were the best four flights that I have ever been on, comparing similar long haul experiences on JAL, ANA, BA, Singapore Airlines and Thai. I believe that the quality is similar to Cathay Pacific but I like their uniform and Korean service style slightly more. ** Asked for ticket

### "provided best possible service"
Sydney to Toronto via Seoul. Korean Air is one of the best airlines I have travelled with and provided us best possible service. The food, cleanness, service is impeccable and highly recommend. Looking forward to fly them again on 28 June 2017 but this time from Vancouver to Sydney!

### "The legroom is remarkable"
Toronto to Sydney via Seoul Incheon. This was the return leg from Canada. On the 2 outbound and 2 return legs each aircraft economy class was full. The aircraft were clean and in good condition - everything worked. The legroom is remarkable. For a 183cm person I had 10cm of space between my knees and the seat in front - even when it was reclined. Both aircraft on the return had touch-screen IFE, however, the limited choices are a minus. For some reason, the route taken by Korean Air seems afflicted by frequent turbulence. This results in a loud tone when the seat belt sign is illuminated and an announcement, and a second tone when it's switched off. This is very disturbing when one is trying to sleep. Another annoyance with this airline is its lack of enforcement of the cabin baggage rules. In the boarding lounge, many passengers have up to 3 bags resulting in lack of space in the aircraft overhead bins. It was interesting to see the cavernous bins on the 787. The food on both legs was passable with the exception of a beef and pasta offering. The beef was fatty, the pasta stuck to the base of the foil container and the beans and carrots mushy. The cabin on the ICN-SYD was freezing - well, not quite, but it couldn't have been more than 17C. Observing the other passengers, at least 95% were wrapped in the provided blankets. On the three preceeding Korean Air flights I was comfortable in jeans and long-sleeve business shirt, But I had to put on my jacket and wrap up in an blanket also. Two complaints to a cabin attendant made no change. The flight lef Incheon 30 minutes late but landed in Sydney 3 minutes ahead of schedule.

### "Excellent service provided"
Mumbai to Seoul Incheon with Korean Air, Flight was in time, and the food served during flight is very delicious. Excellent service provided by cabin crew and I found the ground service is the best. Good inflight entertainment.

### "never take Korean Air anymore"
Singapore to Seoul return. I will never take Korean Air anymore. Departing from Singapore there was no issue. But when I want to return to from Incheon Airport, their ground staff was rude. I reached airport 3 hour before departing, when I would like to enter to the queue for check-in / boarding pass, the ground staff was asking what passport are we holding, if it's not Singapore Passport should go for self check-in machine. We tried the self-check-in machine before but failed, due to first name & family name on the ticket not exactly as per passport, and the ground staff refer us to another queue for help desk. But when turn to me, the help desk guy doesn't want to help and refer me to back to the first counter (which is priority for SG Passport). When I questioned why he can't help, his answer is : those Korean queue behind of me might have urgent matter than me, so he should assist them first! This is principle of queuing? Even through he assist to get my boarding pass done at the end, this is worst memory and I will never take this airline anymore.

### "leg room was the best"
Seoul to Brisbane. Excellent service including check-in and cabin. Economy seat leg room was the best I have found on an international airline. Cabin staff in economy were most attentive to the needs of the passengers and very courteous. Food was excellent with good choices. Toilets were kept clean.

### "Excellent service both ways"
London to Jeju return via Seoul. Excellent service both ways, but especially outbound, perhaps because there were fewer than 20 pax on the A380's upper deck. Good catering, informative inflight info, excellent IFE system and selection. The seat on the A230 is a fairly standard 2 abreast lay-flat, comfortable as these go. Fortunately there was no-one in the seat beside me, because if so and they had the seat flat, it would have been awkward to climb over to get to the aisle. Seat on the 747 undoubtedly better; more room and each pair is staggered, so window etc seats have access to the aisle through a gap between seats - much better than clambering over the person next to you! So I preferred the 747 seat (which is a newer design), but it was interesting having the mix of A380 and B747 on this route. For me, despite the better 747 seat, this showed that the A380 is much the better passenger experience. It's smoother and much quieter. Also the 747 lavatories are cramped by comparison with the A380. The only negatives on this trip were having to collect and schlepp my case from Seoul Incheon to Seoul Gimpo (especially as my travel agent told me that Korean Air would do this! ), and the inadequate lounge at Incheon departures.

### "cheaper than premium economy"
London to Auckland return via Seoul. Not having previously flown business class I'm not comparing it to other airlines, however my return trip was cheaper in Korean Business Class than in Cathay Pacific or Air New Zealand Premium Economy. I'm sure Business Class in other airlines may be swankier, but the food was good with adequate choice, staff were attentive, and the cabins were full but quiet. On the way out the two night flights had very spacious layouts with privacy screens, lie flat beds and easy access from window seats to aisle due to staggered arrangement. On the way back it was two day flights in a more basic arrangement but the seats still went flat. Due to the long changeover in Seoul on the way back a free transit hotel was provided - outside the airport but very close to it. Very good hotel, and dinner and breakfast were included. There is only one niggle, that is there wasn't enough choice on the IFE. Dedicated check in desks, lounges clean.

### "my flight was wonderful"
Los Angeles to Manila via Seoul. My flight was wonderful. The lay over at Incheon was not boring. Free internet access. Feeling a little thirsty I asked one of the flight crew for a coke. Waited for at least five minutes without the coke when I realized that maybe the staff forgot about my request, hence I decided to go to where the food and drinks station is located. The staff I approached was very pleasant who asked if there is anything I wanted, and poured me a coke. Few minutes later the cabin staff approached me with a can of coke and a pouch of crackers, very apologetic for forgetting my request.

### "good and very comfortable"
A rather good flight overall. Good and very comfortable / spacious hard product (despite the old 2-2-2 cabin layout in Business), on time, with good information and a very active and friendly cabin crew (except for the interaction I'll describe further). Korean Air Ground staff in CDG were very good and managed to help me join my reservation with a connecting KE flight (under a different reservation) and tag my luggage directly to the final destination, which saved me a lot of time and hassle in ICN. Onboard, pillows are quite small and not that comfortable for a full-flat bed in Business Class, similar to what you would find in Premium Economy on some other airlines. Catering could also be improved (KE always has very good food on long haul flights in economy class but I feel the upside between business and economy is not up to what you find on other Skyteam members). The big surprise came a little later down the flight when I was taking pictures of the economy cabin from the rear of the lower deck. A cabin crew came rushing out of nowhere and started asking me whether I took pictures, to which I replied "yes of course is that a problem?". Without further explanation she requested to see the pictures I had taken with my cellphone (I didn't know people can actually ask for that?) which I did while asking what the issue was (no reply). After a few seconds she said "ah it's OK" and left. No further explanation, no apologies for the rude (or stressed out) tone of voice.. The cabin manager came during that time and was standing nearby not saying anything and just left without saying a word. I've been flying countless times for over 10 years with Korean Air and have never experienced any such situation. This just felt really rude and a bit strange that the staff couldn't just have a polite and simple discussion with me to explain what the issue was.

### "the staff were very respectful and courteous"
Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia to Seoul, South Korea with Korean Air (return). Both flights were uneventful, helped by the fact that the staff were very respectful and courteous. The food in economy was average but consistent with other Korean Air flights. The flight departed an hour late but this was well communicated via email and at the check-in counter at the airport. Also, the IFE worked OK despite the touch screen on my seat feature not functioning.

### "I wish never made the purchase"
Seoul to Los Angeles. If you are buying a ticket for someone else, do not buy. When you are purchase a ticking using your own credit card for someone else, Korean Air will make you go to their Los Angeles office to verify your credit card (payment methods). I have spoken to a customer service rep (English speaker) over the phone and Korean Air will not accept any other method of verification. I think it’s great that they have a strict security system. However, I believe it’s unnecessary to have your customer drive over 50 miles (3 hours in total drive – round trip) to verify that I am the credit card holder. There were cheaper airline tickets available at the time of purchase. However, I wanted to buy a premium airline ticket (Korean Air, Asiana Air, Singapore Air) for my in-laws. Honestly, this has been the worst experience ever. I wish never made the purchase. Would have saved a lot of money, time and frustration,

### "appallingly slow with zero sense of urgency"
I have been in a check-in line at Incheon for one hour and still have at least 15 mins more until I reach the front. It is appallingly slow with zero sense of urgency and no assistance for passengers when their flights reach last call. Incheon is supposedly a top and modern airport and I am shocked by this antiquated system. Even Bangkok check-ins move faster than this. If flying Korean Air, you need to arrive 3 hours before.

### "terrible customer service"
❎ Unverified |  Los Angeles to Phuket via Seoul Incheon. Do not book your flight with Korean Air, they have terrible customer service. We booked our trip 8 months in advance and paid for our flights and hotels. My husband ended up not being able to go on the trip so I tried to change the ticket to my son and was told this was not possible. Supervisors will says they will call you back in 7-8 hours and a week goes by without a call, I tired calling everyday and was told they were unavailable. We ended up not being able to on the trip and lost over $5000 in air fare and hotels money paid. Our family is completely devastated. We never go on expensive trips and the first one we attempted we lost out on all because Korean Air can not change a ticket name from a father to a son of the same family. Weird since they advertise they pride themselves on family.

### "impressed by the legroom"
Singapore to Honolulu via Seoul Incheon. Singapore to Incheon on an A330-300 which has the new economy class seats. I was impressed by the legroom which makes this 6 hours flight more than comfortable. The touch screen IFE system is very responsive; I am a pop songs enthusiast, the IFE had offered me so far the greatest variety of songs. My connecting flight from Incheon to Honolulu is operated by an old B747-400, and even though the IFE is the old version, the seat was surprisingly comfortable, despite the outdate, it still has wide choices of songs and movies. For both flights, the meals were very tasty, the cabin crew and ground staff in Incheon airport are very friendly and helpful. I would definitely fly again soon.

### "exceptionally good value"
Auckland to London via Seoul. Excellent communication to advise us that inbound flight was delayed so checked in later. Staff were professional both on the ground and in the air. The selection of food in the premier class lounges was good and seating at both Auckland and Incheon comfortable with plenty of room. On board our seats were 180 flat beds. Very good menu options. Selection of films was also very good. As our flight from Seoul to London connected the following day, Korean put you up at the Hyatt Regency and included dinner and breakfast. Great layover! Really recommend this airline as being exceptionally good value.

### "very polite charming flight attendants"
Good price paid for a business class fare return from London to Auckland and I wasn’t expecting too much but was pleasantly surprised. Very polite charming flight attendants if at times a little robotic but good service. I ordered a steak on two sectors and it was wonderfully cooked, something I wasn’t expecting from an airline meal however drinks are served in thimble sized glasses but the flight crew are always obliging with top ups but wine choice is rather limited for a business class product. The 747–8 from Seoul to Auckland business class suites are fantastic private semi enclosed suites with direct aisle access and I understand that Korean may start to use this aircraft on the London to Seoul route which is a far superior business class experience than the 2-3-2 layout of the current 777-300 currently used out of Heathrow. Please be aware that for some reason Korean runs the cabin temperature high so dress lightly although from my own experience this mainly seems to be on the 77-300’s.

### "everyone was extremely courteous and professional"
We have just returned from a Christmas trip from Sydney having got business class tickets for £2450 with Korean Air. I think for this money one needs to limit their expectations. It's a flat bed to the other side of the world. Premium carriers were well over £3000. Check in was quick and smooth, the lounges were fine, not top class but for the money more than adequate. Food offering at Seoul was average at best, Sydney breakfast was the best of all. On board everyone was extremely courteous and professional. English was widely spoken. The food offering was pretty good on most sectors even asking how one wanted their steak cooked and then delivering on that offer, the Korean dishes were good especially their signature Bibimbap. I had one dish (cold noodle salad) that wasn't for me, without hesitation after seeing I had not touched it the Flight attendant offered me any other choice I wanted. Korean seems to put less emphasis on drinks than European airlines. Not a bad thing, just different. However once you realise that they only pour about a third of a glass at a time or won't be quick in offering drinks after take off you only had to ask and a drink appeared immediately and with a smile. The wine from LHR was mainly French and pretty average. From ICN-SYD was Californian or Australian and better. There are some new films but the on board entertainment is average. With iPads loaded with films and magazine sthis becomes less important these days. The business bed (the older type on 777's out of Heathrow and the 380 to SYD) were spacious although not the most comfortable for some one 6'3'. They say they are 180 degree flat beds but they aren't completely flat. There was an annoying plastic foot rest that meant you couldn't stretch out enough and the head rest wouldn't push up far enough to not hit your shoulders, along with the pillows being about A4 size. I see that from April Korean are rostering a 747-8 on the LHR-INC route that will have the new prestige sleeper suite. Although also prices are rising to £2550-£2850. I think once you start pushing towards £3k better airlines start to look good value. Due to the near 20 hour gap between flights Korean put you up at The Grand Hyatt hotel at the airport which was fantastic. We had dinner and breakfast included and the food on offer was spectacular. If time is no major concern the ability to break the journey (especially at an airlines expense) have a great nights sleep and then carry on the next day is ideal. I don't think I have ever felt this good after 24 hours of arriving back from Australia.

### "service was exceptional"
I often take flight from Seoul to Paris CDG and vice versa. It's long and tiring flight especially when you are in economy. However, I wouldn't be too frustrated about flying 12 hours with Korean Air. First of all, from check in to ground staff all are kind. The last trip was everything I could ask for an economy passenger. The cabin crew service was exceptional. I was very tired so I decide to sleep and miss my meal. Not only did they reserve a meal for me they combined part of an economy meal and business meal to serve me from the middle of nowhere. They checked up on me several times during flight if everything fine until I walked out through boarding gate.

### "would not hesitate to fly again with them"
I flew to Las Vegas in March 2016. From Manila, I had a layover in Seoul and then flew to Los Angeles. That was a 19 hour flight in total I think. I especially like their spacious legroom. They have excellent food quality. Korean Air's staff are all friendly and attentive to passengers needs. The only thing I didn't like was the clogged sink in the toilet. Overall, I would not hesitate to fly again with them.

### "food mediocre on both legs"
Check in at LHR appeared to be outsourced and was helpful. We had a connecting flight fro SYD to AKL which had been booked separately but they managed to have our luggage checked right through and gave us guidance on how to ensure that the transit at SYD went smoothly. Cabin interior on 777 from LHR to ICN seemed tired. Seats were almost lie flat but combination of protruding headrest and small pillow was most uncomfortable. Cabin stiflingly, almost unbearably, hot during the night. Much more comfortable on A380 on second leg. Food mediocre on both legs. One western (beef and potatoes) and two Korean main courses. Accompaniments basic at best. A limited choice of a couple of reasonable red and white wines on the menu but when presented by staff this came over as whether your preference was red or white with no bottles or indication of the range of choice on display. IFE basic with small range of movies and a definite shortage of blockbusters. Remote did not work on first leg. Staff were generally capable and keen to please on both legs. This trip with Korean Air was offered at a substantial discount to the major providers' pricing and that made it acceptable.

### "my last flight with them"
Hong Kong to Nadi, Fiji via Seoul. It was my first flight with Korean Air and it certainly is the last one. Whoever told me it is one of the best, seems to not have traveled with any other company apart from some Ryanair or American Airlines, which, ironically, are better than Korean Air as far as I am concerned. My gluten free food - I don't know exactly what they put there, but my strong medicine couldn't help me. When I asked for half a lemon and warm water, which usually helps me a tiny bit at least to calm down when I am trapped on the plane without access to medical help, they gave me a small slice and were visibly annoyed when I asked for more lemon. The service onboard is outrageous. Air-hostesses are more concerned with how they look instead of how they work. Rude answers to simple questions, blocking the way to lavatory while reading something and ignoring me saying "excuse me" a few times, not even saying good bye when passengers were leaving the plane. These are just some examples. On top of those, my suitcase was broken. The mess they created out of this situation is unbelievable. There's nothing straightforward, even to proceed with compensation they ask you to sign a weird document to state you have already received the money (what?). To get the money, you need to go to the airport to get cash from their representative. Imagine being on a small island with a broken luggage not knowing where even to buy a new one that you will like and will not want to throw away to waste. Entertainment system is a joke. Definitely my last flight with them.

### "fantastic flights yet again"
Brisbane to Paris CDG via Incheon. Fantastic flights with Korean Air yet again. I've flown this airline several times before and am always glad each time I return. All flights on time. Aircraft are very clean and modern. Seat pitch very generous. Full service with extras like amenity kits, stainless steel cutlery and hot towels, all of which are disappearing from economy on many large carriers now. Cabin crew are always friendly and professional. Overnight layover provided at the Grand Hyatt in Incheon is fantastic, very nice hotel and seemless transfer. Incheon airport is also a great for a stopover. Highly recommend Korean Air, and hope try their prestige class next time.

### "crew attentive and helpful"
Manila to New York JFK via Seoul. My flight experience with Korean Air was wonderful. There was no issues with checking in etc, except for some wait from Manila. The crew were generally accommodating, attentive and quite helpful. Able to clearly communicate in English when I had some questions. I will fly with KE again.

### "standard flight with no frills"
Flew Korean Air from Ulaanbaatar to Incheon. I didn't enjoy this return trip quite as much as previous flights since I had with Korean Air. However, this was not entirely the airlines fault. The passengers I had sat next to on both the going and return legs had poor flight etiquette and understanding of personal space. The meals options were both Korean cuisine but tasted alright. The IFE worked fine both ways. It was a standard flight with no frills.

### "the best airline I have flown"
Incheon to Hanoi with Korean Air. So far the best airline I have flown on. The crew are very young, nice, polite - always smiling and helpful. Even staff at the airport are very polite and helpful. The food was good except the dessert which was tofu with sweet ginger and soy sauce which I have never had in my life and it was poor. Inflight entertainment had a lot of Korean options and it would be better if they had more International movies.

### "arrive in Europe fresh and rested"
I recently travelled from Sydney to Prague (via Incheon) with Korean Air. The legroom on both legs was surprisingly good for economy. Food, service and entertainment were all first rate. The best though is the stopover in Incheon. Arrived late afternoon and taken to 5 star hotel in Incheon and provided with meal vouchers for dinner and breakfast. Plenty of time to walk around the centre of the city, have a great nights sleep and transfer back to the airport in the morning. Definitely the way to go to arrive in Europe fresh and rested. This was my first trip with this airline but it certainly wont be the last.

### "staff were really helpful"
London Heathrow to Seoul Incheon. The staff were really helpful and attentive. The flight was slightly delayed but we needed to catch our train shortly after arriving (this journey only runs once a day). One attendant helped us get to the front of the plane (we were all the way at the back), she really went above and beyond which meant we caught our train on time!

### "counter service was horrible"
Washington to Seoul Incheon. The Korean Air counter service was horrible. Their kiosks was not working. When I got to the counter and weigh my 2 check in bags which is under the weight limit. Then she ask to weigh my carry on and laptop bag. She stated that my carry on combination was over the weight limitations. I ask her what do you mean? She said the combination of both bags should be under 12kg. While the gentlemen next checking in with me who has the same amount of luggages and carry on bags go in without his carry on bags being weigh. It cost me $100 for 5 pounds of extra weight. Lesson learn : Korean air pick and choose who ever they want to charge extra. And this is will be my last flight with Korean Air.

### "very good service"
Flight from Sao Paulo (GRU) to Los Angeles with Korean Air in business class. Old aircraft, Airbus A330. Old cabin. Departure was delayed 20 minutes. Very good service from the cabin crew. They even served one main course with the side dish of another main course. Service is attentive not intrusive. Arrived on time at LAX. Will fly again with Korean but only in newer aircraft.

### "the worst Asian airline"
New York JFK to Tashkent via Seoul Incheon. This is the worst Asian airline I could ever flown. Customer service is inexistent. Business seat are small, not fully 180 degrees reclinable and lacking any other amenities (decent pillow, comforter, etc). The entertaining system is only good if you want to know your flight path, but the selection of movies is terribly old. Food, besides being mediocre for a business class, is 90% Korean. Beverages are average and limited. Female cabin crew were impossible to understand in English and clearly not there for foreigners or willing to accommodate anything you ask for. Be aware that if you, like in my case a Diamond Elite 360 Delta Skymiles member, or have an account with any Skyteam partner airline, you will not accrue elite qualifying miles, bonus miles, or extras. Korean Air just gives you base flown miles! There is no recognition for your elite status with other Skymiles partner airline. The business lounge at Incheon is awful. It is more like being in an open street bazar, and lacking any basic services. Avoid this airline at all cost. First and last experience for me. For the same ticket price, you have better options in Asia.

### "I felt like a valued customer"
First time flying out of the country from San Francisco to Incheon and I had a great experience. Initially, there was a flight delay because the in-flight entertainment system needed rebooting, which is understandable considering the long 12 hour flight. Despite the delay, we made it to Incheon Int'l Airport on time. The flight attendants were attentive and nice, and I felt like a valued customer. Complimentary sleep masks, slippers, and a toothbrush and toothpaste were given as well. The food was really good, relative to what I expect of airplane food. We were served food twice, snacks twice, and refreshment beverages here and there. I found the meals to be quite balanced, each one containing the main proteins/carbs, side dish, and a slice of dessert. After looking around at cheaper options, I'm glad I went with my gut and booked with Korean Air. A 12 hour flight can be extremely uncomfortable, but it was very.

### "had a positive experience "
I had a positive experience on my recent flight from Incheon to Chicago. I felt the crew provided very high-quality service. Even though I was travelling economy, I felt  well taken care of. There is not much to say about the food, it was not pleasantly surprising. My seat was comfortable and there was enough leg room. I have mixed emotions about the seat headrest though. It was just comfortable enough so that I could sit and rest without using the neck pillow I packed, but it was not supremely comfortable, so I still wanted to use my neck pillow at times. However, the presence of the headrest made it physically awkward to use my neck pillow (despite the percentage of my review devoted to this topic, it was not that big of a deal). The in-flight entertainment options were solid, with a good variety of movies from different genres. I enjoyed the collection of audio tracks. The blanket was more comfortable than average, and a perfect size. The design was beautiful, a soft purple with faded Korean Air logos. My flight with Korean Air was a carefree experience, exactly what commercial flying should be.

### "excellent customer service"
Vancouver to Cebu via Incheon with Korean Air. Excellent customer service. Upon check-in in Vancouver, I informed the Korean Air staff that my mother's last name was missing a letter. Right away, they catered for us and positively informed us that they should be able to fix the mistakes. There were 3 staff helping us out and all of them were super friendly. We were very pleased of the customer service that we recieved from this airline, from the check-in counter to the flight attendants. I will recommend this airline to all my friends and relatives.

### "helpful ground service staff"
Hong Kong to Seoul on Boeing 747-8I. Generally young cabin crew. No choice of meal offered as I was seated at the rear. USB port, Pillow and blanket available in the 3-hour flight. Seoul Incheon to Hong Kong on Boeing 777-300. Cabin crew speaks fluent English. Courteous service and helpful ground service staff. There is a counter reserved for passengers who are late for their flight.

### "service was impeccable"
Seoul to Los Angeles. The A380  is something to just behold (the size of the aircraft, interior space, the onboard store, the lounges, etc). I was flying economy, so I did not get to see the 2nd deck, however the photos that are easily available can certainly demonstrate the "flying city" that the KE A380 is. Customer Service that is provided by the professional staff is jaw-dropping (when compared to US Airlines). The International carriers actually "care" about the customer - and it shows. Service was impeccable - in economy. Once airborne, the various sections of economy had their own dedicated flight attendants, and they ensured each passenger in their area of responsibility was taken care of. The onboard store is a nice touch, on such a long flight. The food was outstanding. And, I was sought out by the crew, about 120min before touchdown in LAX, and "asked" if I would mind moving to 1st class for the remainder of the flight, in order to ensure that I made my connecting flight (I had a 2hr 10min layover in LAX). Of course I accepted, so by the time I traversed the aircraft to the front, I had about 1hr+ to enjoy 1st class. Upon landing I was the first off, there was a KE attendant at the end of the bridge with my name on a sign, and they took me thru Customs, in a expedious manner (even though I was Global Entry, the KE clearance was much quicker). The attendant stayed with me until I retrieved my bags and I was clear customs and out of the International terminal in about 40min total! If you are flying to Asia, there are several 5star carriers - but KE is at the top of the list.

### "strong alternative to other companies"
Nagoya to Seoul Incheon. Excellent staff on the ground and on board. Excellent food in quality and quantity. Seat very comfortable and good in-flight Entertainment. Good punctuality of the flights. I would advise taking this company, and I think it is a strong alternative to other companies flying this route.

### "experience was very pleasant"
Excellent flight from London to Incheon. Despite it being my first long distance flight the experience was very pleasant and all crew were excellent and helpful. The in-flight food and drinks were surprisingly good. The price was fair for the time of year and despite being in economy I felt that I had adequate space. Would definitely recommend Korean Air.

### "no crew speaks French"
Paris to Seoul Incheon with Korean Air. Nice A380. Seats are OK. However, no crew member speaks French (we were departing from Paris), no announcement was made in French, and crew members hardly speak English. Meals were meh, and in-flight entertainment did not offer a lot movies compared to other airlines.

### "service good, comfort the missing element"
Tokyo Narita to Vancouver via Incheon with Korean Air. It is actually very difficult to secure a seat on a 777 (low density 9 abreast) between Vancouver and Asia during the summer months. So Korean's B747-8i flight looked like it might be an alternative, even at a substantial premium to other airlines. Unfortunately on my return leg to YVR, an older B747-400 was used. Legroom in coach seems reasonable for KE on the 8i, but seat 63H on a B747-400 felt really tight. Service was good but the comfort was the missing element. I had contemplated purchasing 3 seats for my son and I on a cheaper carrier, but had decided not to. That might have been a mistake.

### "I was satisfied with the performance"
Flown from Seattle to Incheon and then Incheon to Singapore with Korean Air. I was satisfied with the performance and service rendered by the ground crew in Seattle and Incheon. The seat (33A) was spacious by my standard (5' 5" and 130 pounds). Sufficient leg room. Even though the plane was full, there was sufficient overhead compartment space for every passenger to put their hand luggage/bags. Flight crew on both legs were friendly and attentive. Food wise, it was sufficient but the taste left much to be desired. KE does not provide packets of salt and pepper. Entertainment was limited (I'm being spoilt by the 100+ movies and TV shows on Emirates and Qatar Airways) and came only in 4 languages, predominantly English and Korean..

### "low on seat comfort"
After Korean Air flew a relatively new A330-300 on the Incheon - Mumbai leg, one had mistakenly assumed that KE has phased out their ancient A330-200 from this route. Sadly, BOM-ICN found the old A330-200 in service again. Low on seat comfort and sad-looking toilets. Otherwise not much to complain about. Check-in was quick. Cabin crew were on their toes and efficient even if not overly friendly. The meals seem to have gone down a notch and getting repetitive. Flight arrived pretty much on time. A good option for the BOM-ICN route if you don't mind the slightly higher fare.

### "aircraft was immaculate"
Flew from Kansai to Busan. Flight was delayed for 2 hours but the ground staff were very professional and offered everyone meal vouchers. Despite a one hour flight, meals and drinks were served. The aircraft was immaculate and crew were extremely professional and smiley. I will definitely fly Korean Air again.

### "an uneventful flight"
KE124, Brisbane to Incheon (A330) and KE867, Incheon to Ulaanbaatar (A330) with Korean Air. An uneventful flight which began with a quick check-in where I was recognised as an Alitalia Millemiglia Ulisse member with priority-check in and boarding. The flight itself was smooth until we were half-way into our journey from ICN to ULN when turbulent weather delayed the food service. The meals from ICN to BNE where a mixture of Asian and Western cuisine, while the food on the ICN to ULN leg were entirely Asian cuisine, comprising of chicken or beef with noodles. Overall, the food was of good quality. As for the IFE, I found the options to be reasonably plentiful to keep me occupied for the entire 15 hour trip. I would fly with Korean Air again.

### "Korean Air always impresses"
Our recent flight was our fourth trip to the UK in 6 years from Sydney to London via Seoul and as usual Korean Air always impresses with its high standards in every aspect of flying. The flight attendants are friendly, smiling and cannot do enough to make the flight so enjoyable. The planes are well maintained, new, spotlessly clean and very comfortable with abundant leg room, even in economy. The pilots keep you informed and provide a smooth and safe flight from takeoff to landing. Entertainment is more than adequate, varied and up to date. The food / beverage options are most appetizing with a variety of choices. From Sydney to London, Seoul is an excellent stop over as it breaks the journey in half (2 x 10, 11 hour flights) and the accommodation provided by KAL, as part of the fare, is always the best. Our last trip we stayed at the Orakai Songdo Park Hotel in Songdo about 25 minutes from Incheon Airport. Incheon is a great airport, very easy to get around and has everything to keep you entertained and refreshed between flights. Check-In, security and luggage collection is always a simple, quick process.

### "didn’t offer anything"
I flew Korean Air from Bali to Seoul in Prestige Class (Business Class). Though it is one of the longest intra-Asia routes (7 hours), the food and service onboard are both really poor. First of all, there is no proper meal to be served after taking off. Korean Air probably expects that all passengers would choose sleeping instead. For the first meal there was just one satay with two drops of hot sauce. For the second meal (breakfast) before landing, there was only one bowl of very watery congee with three different toppings. This was one of the worst catering experiences I have had. Secondly, the service was sloppy. The FA I interacted with was indifferent and didn't want to bothered. I also notice they only serve quarter glasses of champagne each time which is very annoying. So instead of giving you a full glass of champagne, they would serve it to you four times if you were consistent enough to keep calling them back. Other airlines like Thai would offer amenity kit for such a long flight but Korean Air didn’t offer anything. All in all, a waste of money.

### "ground staff service unacceptable"
Qingdao to London via Seoul. I can only echo some of the previous reviews of Korean Air. In flight service was good. Ground staff service was totally unacceptable. Rude, intransigent people with little idea of customer service. Just a total unwillingness to accept any other point of view and resolve a problem of their own making. I travel to Korea several times a year. This was my first and last experience of Korean Air. I will revert to Asiana for future trips.

### "service has been steadily improving"
Finally Korean Air upgraded this route from Incheon to Mumbai to an A330-300, newer aircraft, clean cabin and toilets. KE cabin service has been steadily improving in recent years and they put up a good show. Meals were served as requested, they came by with water a couple of times, and responded promptly to the bell. Leg room was adequate. Flight itself departed slightly late due to congestion at ICN and landed only 10 minutes late. The captain switched on the seat-belt sign for turbulence only when there indeed was a bit of a weather unlike some other airlines that seem to use the seat-belt sign as an excuse for managing traffic in the cabin. Web check-in was easy and the line at ICN was short, the counter staff were pleasant. Now only if they would increase the frequency on this route to daily and make their cabin crew profile more diverse.

### "charming cabin attendants"
Honolulu to Tokyo Narita with Korean Airline and they lived up to their motto "Excellence in Flight". Fast check-in, on-time departure, seat had pillow, blanket and bottle water when boarding, 2 delicious meals, charming cabin attendants, sufficient legroom, clean lavatories, good variety of in-seat entertainment, amenity kit with slippers and toothbrush. Made time between Honolulu and Tokyo pass quickly. All this for under $600 round trip, booked via travel agent. Would not hesitate to use again on very competitive route (served by 6, soon-to-be 7 airlines). Comments also apply to return flight NRT-HNL.

### "great service and food"
Tel Aviv - Incheon on 5/5/16 and return to Tel Aviv on 19/5/16. Great flights. Comfortable seats. Great service and food. Flight very quiet, selction of movies could be better. Same movies on both flights however I slept for most of the flights. Both flights on time. If needed - will fly with them again.

### "undone by terrible ground service"
Fukuoka to New York via Seoul Incheon with Korean Air. Its a shame that such a great flight can be undone by terrible ground service. We had our flight home canceled 5 days before our return. Okay,. what can you do - so we lost a day of our vacation and it would add an extra 8 hours to our 24 hour return. Korean Air called and said that they would put us in a hotel for our layover in Incheon. When we arrived nobody knew anything. They said the voucher they had sent us was for the business class lounge. We had purchased business class tickets so we were already in the business class lounge. When we went to the Korean Air desk they played dumb so I asked for a manager and the young man said he was the manager. Well heaven help Korean Air if he's in charge. After standing there refusing to go away he finally gave a voucher to the airport hotel; a cell with soap and nothing else. When I called Korean Air to complain they did nothing. I asked for a supervisor and they said,"They're busy. Basically no service when things go wrong.

### "fairly wide seats"
I got re-routed onto Korean Air from London to Tokyo via Seoul, after my flight with Alitalia was cancelled. At check in the staff was very friendly but professional and due to the quiet flight we were allowed to choose to sit wherever we pleased. The flight was great considering it was a night flight. My friends and I got to spread out across three seats each as the flight was so quiet. Even if the flight was fully occupied I believe I still would have been very comfortable as the legroom was fantastic (no metal box underneath window seats that some airlines have), fairly wide seats for economy and very comfortable. The entertainment system was impressive, large screen and very responsive. The choice was good too, I enjoyed watching some of the Star Wars films. The food was amazing, a choice of three meals and one of those included bibimbap. The food was quite fresh and you mixed the food together yourself. It was complimented with a soup of some sort. A few nice touches I liked was the frequent green tea runs throughout the cabin and the matcha tea on the flight to Japan. In addition the lavatories had lovely Jurilique lavender face sprays which I loved. I don't know whether I'd pay to fly them again but they certainly are one of the best carriers I have ever flown on.

### "appreciated the service onboard"
Seoul to Paris with Korean Air. I am traveling with my triathlon bike, which is sometimes an issue for some airlines, but there was no problem at check-in in Seoul and it was perfectly managed up to its arrival in Paris where ground staff was not as gentle with it as ground staff in Seoul. Lounge in Seoul is located quite centrally, which allows to have a quick shower and food prior to boarding. Cabin in A380 is quite standard, not in the top category compared to some other airlines as the seats are the original ones and not yet modernized. The seats are slightly transmitting vibrations from the plane and heat when set in bed mode. Quality of the meals are great, especially for Korean food (it is necessary to be accustomed to Korean food as some dishes can be quite special, e.g. chewy noodles & chilled broth or spicy octopus). I especially appreciated the service onboard. I found the crew efficient and pleasant. After the meal, I made a comment saying I would not say no to chocolate, and few minutes after they brought me a coffee with delicious cookies from upper class. They constantly check if passengers are comfortable and require anything, doing it in a discreet manner without disturbing people. From the various airlines I fly with, Korean Air has one of the best service.

### "genuinely friendly staff"
The 13 hour flight in Business class from Seoul to Toronto onboard Korean Air KE73 turned out to be a real pleasure. Overall, there was a good choice of food, drinks (including Canadian ice wine) and the service was provided by genuinely friendly staff. Definitely recommended.

### "an enjoyable experience"
Sydney to London via Seoul is my first time I have flown Korean Air and an enjoyable experience. Sydney check in was efficient and I was able to send my bags right through to Paris. The layover in Incheon was exceptionally good with accommodation and meal vouchers provided by for stay at the Grand Hyatt Incheon. The next morning I found out that my Air France code share connection was delayed by 3 hours due to industrial problems at CDG. This was a disaster as it gave me a 30 minutes to get to my Eurostar connection to London. I approached Korean Air staff about flying Korean Air direct to London and they were exceptionally helpful. They managed to get me on a flight to London at no extra cost and managed to even help me retrieve my baggage from Air France. The meals and service on Korean Air were very good and there was no shortage of choice. Water was served through the flight. The entertainment system had the latest films but sadly there could have been a bit more variety. I look forward to flying back to Sydney with Korean.

### "Totally unacceptable"
I hope that I never have to fly Korean Air again. After attempting multiple times to purchase my ticket without success online on the Korean Air website, I had to go to a third party website. I then found out when checking my bank account that I had been charged twice for my flight frim the KA website even though I canceled my purchase with Korean Air. My tickets were finally obtained through another company. Korean Air admitted over the phone to their error and issued two emails stating that they would provide a refund in six weeks. Totally unacceptable.

### "I recommend Korean Air"
Auckland to London via Seoul and I recommend Korean Air. The service onboard was very good and flight attendants were delightful, providing service with a smile. The food was pretty good. The flat beds were comfortable and the film selections were current. We enjoyed our flights. The overnight stopover in Seoul at the Grand Hyatt was superb.

### "seat and IFE are below par"
Our flights from Sydney to New York via Seoul were booked though an agent and we were not given an option to log in online. Check in was smooth, however the agent forgot to prompt us to log our frequent flyer numbers. The Skyteam Lounge at Sydney offers a great view but the range and quality of food is very average. The arrival times for both sectors were ideal and allowed a one night stopover at the Grand Hyatt at Incheon Airport. The business class seats are a type that was considered good 10 or 15 years ago, arranged in a 2x2x2 configuration. The seats are narrow, firm and give no direct isle access for window seats. No mattress was provided and the fabric covering the seat is heat inducing. On the subject of heat there are no individual air vents, which is very irritating. To be fair, the cabin was not kept too hot, as is often the case. A synthetic blanket was supplied as was a small amenity kit that omits the all important ear plugs. The first leg departed at around 9.00am and a lunch was served about two hours into the flight. The food selection was below average as was the quality, which was poor. Immediately after lunch the flight attendants closed all the window blinds, including those in the bar and turned off all the lights. This seemed bizarre for a day time flight, particularly as no light was left on at all. Continuing on the bizarre theme I was informed at the bar that only vodka cocktails would be served and no, if I wanted a champagne I needed to order it from my seat. At least the champagne was Perrier Jouet. The lights were turned on to full (A380 has a sophisticated range of options) and the second meal served in bright light, was no better than the first. The inflight entertainment was good and easy to use. However the range is small. So when I fly back to SYD I will have difficulty choosing something I haven't already seen. The lounge in Seoul offers a poor range of food. Although the flight deported at 10am, lunch was served immediately after take-off, all the while being admonished that "The food/liquid is hot. Be careful. Every time. Again the cabin was plunged into darkness and again, only vodka cocktails were served in the bar. Exactly eight hours into the 13.5 hour flight the glare of full light was switched on and another meal was served. From lights on to lights off again was 30 minutes. The crew were running and given the low occupancy rate, for no apparent reason. Whilst the flight attendants are incredibly polite and attentive, they are not particularly intuitive acting on rote. My overall impression of the food and beverage service is that it is below par as is the seat and in flight entertainment.

### "friendly and professional cabin crew"
Los Angeles to Sydney via Seoul Incheon. The cabin crew on both flights worked tirelessly and were very friendly. Food in economy class comes in 3 options, overwhelmingly many passengers opted for BiBimBap, which I like. The wines offered on economy class are very respectable and the Australian flight, I noticed that they served Australian wines of quality. IFE is fine, not an extensive collection of movies and music, however I enjoyed it. IFE could be more responsive in terms of responding to user touch and the screen could be updated to a higher definition screen. A380 aircraft were used on the two sectors I took and an enjoyable plane to be in for long haul flight. Incheon Airport is superb. Korean Air may not have the latest or greatest hardware, however, their friendly and professional cabin crew outweighs their shortcoming in terms of hardware side.

### "should improve their English"
Jakarta to Busan via Seoul. Flying Korean Air I was expecting a quality as other SkyTeam member has to offer. Flown on several long-haul flights before, I was surprised that Korean Air don't provide amenity kit for my flight. They have earplugs and other items if you ask them. But wouldn't it be nice to just have it in a pouch, at your seat? Cabin staff should improve their English.

### "Staff professional and friendly"
Singapore to Seoul with Korean Air, and an excellent experience. The most leg room I have had in economy class. Staff professional and friendly. Meals are as bad as everywhere. The plane was new with big screens. Sometimes the tapping on the touch screen of the passenger behind is annoying. Overall impressed with Korean Air.

### "get some  basics a bit better"
Brisbane to London via Incheon, and both flights had friendly staff, and the food selection was good, particularly the Korean options. The window seat and one next to it are staggered allowing you to exit your seat without having to climb over the person you are sitting next to. The main criticism is that the IFE content is limited and definitely male orientated. Wine selection was ok (2 white 2 red) but they ran out of one of the whites and one of the three menu options wasn't available and as we were asked for our preference first, I assume it was never available. The overnight stop at the Hyatt regency was a welcome break in the journey. The moving map on the A330 didn't it was just a yellow line on a blue background, and you had no idea where you were - worse than useless, whereas the B777 had lots of detail. Korean Air could be up there with the great airlines if they'd get some of the basics a bit better.

### "excellent value for money"
Copenhagen to Ulaanbaatar via Seoul return. Excellent value for money. Cabin clean. Seat very good. Food the best I have eaten on a plane for years. Toilets clean. so helpfull, plenty of smiles. IFE good, many latest released movies, though nothing beats a good book on a long flight. Reguar juice/water runs through the cabin on intercontinetal legs. Hassle free, enjoyable experience flying with Korean Air.

### "a huge disappointment"
I used to fly with Korean Air many times and this time was a huge disappointment. The flights were delayed on both legs without any explanation. ICN to BKK the boarding was in time, but we spent around 1 hour in the plane waiting for departure. The only explanation was given was that we are delayed because of traffic in Incheon airport. According to flight radar this flight is delayed every day. Never in time. The food was just OK, no comparison with my previous flights with Korean Air. It was much smaller than before. No salad was offered. The flight to go back was delayed on more than 4 hours. 1 hour after the flight was supposed to depart, the screen at the airport still showed boarding. No information about estimated time. We were told that the flight is delayed due to weather conditions in Incheon airport only when we asked several times. No announcements were made. When we finally boarded the plane, we found out that the reason of delay was the problem with air traffic control in Hong Kong, not the weather in Incheon. Flight attendants were helpful but not well organized. Food was much better. In Incheon airport had no problems, everything was fast as always. I would still recommend this company. I understand that the delay from BKK to INC was probably not the company fault, but Korean Air representatives should give more information and care more about customers.

### "one of the cheapest airlines"
New York to Manila via Incheon return. The staff were polite, prompt and speak in great English. The downside is sometimes they passed over me when handing things out. Perhaps this was because I was in the window seat or maybe it was just me. But I would like to see better responsiveness. The food and drink is plenty and frequent and delicious. There's a wide variety of beverages from beer and wine to tomato juice. The facilities were clean. For the 14 hour flight we were given blankets, toothbrushes, toothpaste, pillows, headphones, and slippers. The media selection was excellent. They were one of the cheapest airlines I found.

### "select seats in rear cabin"
When ticketing is done in Mumbai, Korean Air only allows you to select seats in the rear cabin. The way to beat the seating restriction is to web check-in where it gives you a choice of all available seats, but the preferred ones are usually taken by that time. Otherwise, the aircraft on this route is an old 777-200, no amenities in the toilets unlike those on the BKK or SIN routes, crew service is adequate, special meals are noted and delivered as requested. Check-in was quick but the Korean Air counter number was not displayed on the screens at BOM, one had to walk down searching for them. Take off was delayed by half an hour, but landed on time. There is good reason why Korean Air will never be a 5-star airline.

### "fare high for the service provided"
Incheon to Mumbai with Korean Air. Flight delayed by 1 hr, first for some connecting passengers, then due to airport congestion. Landed some 45 minutes later than scheduled. Check-in was quick if you have already web checked in. Aircraft was an old A330-200 and it showed, especially in the toilets, but well maintained and clean. Flight was smooth, ample leg room. Cabin crew was efficient, responded promptly to calls and special meals were served as requested. The meals themselves were below par - main VLML dinner course was an unidentifiable white paste, lots of it, and the snack before landing was a soggy sandwich. For a 9-hr flight, they had nothing for an in-between snack except a packet of peanuts (which is hard to believe). Korean Air has the advantage of being the only non-stop flight between ICN and BOM but otherwise their fare is too high for the service provided.

### "never take again"
Seoul Gimpo to Tokyo Haneda. If circumstances permit, I would never take Korean Air again. Up till now, I had trust on their system and service. They were very irresponsible and seem to have a don't care policy against their passengers as long as they could make excuses one way or the other. Our flight was diverted to Osaka on our way to Haneda on 12/31/2015 because of mechanical problems. Well, this kind of problem could happen anytime and I am not complaining about that. What upset me was their attitude towards their passengers. They didn't take any meaningful action until I spoke out and made demands for what we deserve as passengers. What's even worse was that they confused passengers by delivering inaccurate information one after another. They seem to try my patience. My husband had to call Korea to find out what's really going on. He called the customer service after he returned to Korea, but he found out the fact they don't care. Our flight left Gimpo at 9am and supposed to arrive in Haneda around 11am on 12/31. Instead, we arrived around 5pm! What a day to spend, the last day of 2015!.

### "would fly again"
I flew Seoul Incheon to Atlanta return with Korean Air, on A380 in both directions. After years of living in Seoul, I finally experienced the madhouse that is ICN in the mornings. Pro tip: hop in the web check in line if everything is crowded. It was as busy as Sky Priority, but they didn't seem to care who was there. If security is crowded, find the helper at your boarding time and they will help you through crew security without wait. Minus the pitfalls of ICN, the flight was standard for Korean Air. On the way to Atlanta, it was so cold that I had to use a blanket. On the way back, it was warmer, but I still managed to sleep five to six hours. I used to think Korean Air food was good, but then I had Asiana Airlines economy food. The flight attendants were gracious and helpful. I would fly Korean Air again. If you are lucky, snag Seat 47D. It's the seat with crew escape in front of it.

### "proper onboard Business class"
London Heathrow to Brisbane via Seoul Incheon. I had the new flat seats all the way from London to Brisbane, it seems Korean Air recently upgraded their 777-300ER out of LHR to the new seats, and already had this on the A330-300 from ICN to BNE. Fully reclining 180 degree seat with partition, and excellent food (loved the steak option!) Great service. The overnight stop at the Grant Hyatt in ICN on the way back was excellent, and food amazing (provided with vouchers). I found the carpets in the toilets clean and a nice touch, despite what others say about this. Although the technology for inflight entertainment system is excellent, there wasn't much choice of content compared to other airlines I've been on. Maybe only 15 recent Hollywood movies, and I'd guess only around 40-50 programs in total. I'd also suggest providing noise cancelling headsets as is the norm now on other business class flights. Skyteam FF program is one of the least generous I have seen. Pretty sure one business class trip LHR-BNE-LHR on Cathay puts you to straight to Saphire, or not far off it, which comes with some decent benefits. Korean Air Business class lounge at Incheon is a bit basic, not much food choice, showers only lukewarm. I didn't understand how to use the fast pass at ICN (they didn't seem to accept the one I was given). Korean Air was substantially cheaper and the overall experience not much different to Cathay, who I flew last time. If you want an airline that offers a proper onboard Business class experience and you aren't that worried about inflight entertainment, Korean Air is an excellent choice/value for money.

### "would recommend them"
We flew Korean Air business class from London to Sydney return via Seoul Incheon and cabin crew were impressive on both journeys, being professional and attentive. The food was excellent and plentiful as were drinks. The interior of the planes were clean, spacious and well kept with all facilities expected in business class. The seats were lie flat and the choice of entertainment very good - kept me occupied. The layover at Seoul was very smooth and we were put up in the Grand Hyatt - again, a very pleasant surprise. I would fly with Korean Air in the future and would recommend them too.

### "price was competitive"
London to Sydney via Seoul Incheon with Korean Air, and the cabin crew were very welcoming and attentive. The food was good and price was competitive. If I was to pick fault the wine offering and pre flight drinks was quite limited but they were okay. The biggest problem with Korean is their inflight entertainment - the system and screens are good but the content is limited and tends to favour "male gender" type film choices - I found 5-6 films I was prepared to watch my wife found none and read a book. One thing travellers should note is that the seat plans on a number of websites are wrong on the Boeing 777-300 ER we travelled on (HL8010) the business cabin seats are staggered, so if you have a window seat you don't have to climb over the person in the isle seat also row 7 is in a mini cabin of its own.

### "food was outstanding"
Bangkok to Dallas Fort Worth via Seoul Incheon with Korean Air. The level of professionalism and attitude that flight attendants demonstrated was unparalleled in my other flying experiences, and they were extremely attentive throughout the entire flight. The food was outstanding, with a choice of entree, and included traditional Korean options. None of my flights were delayed. The business class lounges at each of the airports was stocked with top shelf liquor and a variety of food options. I would recommend this airline, and I think that the business class prices are 100% worth it.

### "Korean Air is a good choice"
Vienna to Auckland via Seoul Incheon, and a very good price for Korean Air Business-Class. Staff service is nice. Organisation on the airports and the flight is perfect. Food was good, Infotainment was ok. Seats were good and clean condition. Lots of room and space to store your stuff on long flights. If you fly long distance Korean Air is a good choice.

### "a very pleasant flight"
Auckland to Seoul on Korean Air, overall a very pleasant flight and on time. Flight attendents were courteous and helpful. Two meals served which I found tasty and well presented. Regular water and juice runs. Washrooms could have been cleaned more regularly. There is a limited selection of music and movies on AVOD.

### "no hesitation recommending"
London to Sydney via Seoul Incheon. Boarding at LHR was quick and efficient. Although flight was full, it was a clean Boeing 777 with new seats including a USB, a power point and a decent screen. Although the movie selection was ‘boy orientated’ there was a good spread of new films. The cabin crew were extremely efficient, attentive and regularly cleaned the toilets. The food was relatively bland on the LHR-ICN leg but better on ICN-SYD. Incheon Airport is extremely easy to navigate and we were given gate information at LHR. Economy passengers can use the Sky Hub lounge for about $30. Although it only served a surprisingly good selection of food as well as beer, wine and spirits it was immediately adjacent to free shower facilities and one of the cleanest toilets I have ever seen at an airport. The second flight was on a new A380, again full but with a decent seat pitch, meticulous cabin crew and a choice of dinner and breakfast, as well as regular wine top up, it was a surprisingly stress-free flight down to Sydney. We arrived on time and exiting the aircraft was quick and efficient. The price of this flight was about two-thirds of the equivalent with the Middle East airlines and I would have no hesitation recommending it on the basis of my experience.

### "Korean Air always impresses"
The comfort, service and food on Korean Air always impresses. This was our fourth trip to Europe via Seoul and we will go no other way. An added bonus is the overnight stay, this time at the new and luxurious Hyatt Hotel, 3 minutes from the airport. The whole experience flying Korean Air is relaxing with no hassles due to the hard working, friendly crew and clean, comfortable, new or refurbished aircraft. Our flights were all on time or early. The 3-3-3 seating on the 777 and plenty of leg room make the cabin appear quite spacious in economy. Also the two approximately 10 hour flights make the trip very bearable, along with the above mentioned attributes of Korean Air as well as the excellent facilities at Incheon Airport. I have recommended Korean Air to 6 other couples flying to European/American destinations from Sydney in recent years and only positive comments have been made regarding their Korean Air flights.

### "constant care by stewardess"
ICN to CDG with Korean Air. Skyteam priority member can benefit from the check-in counter by separate check-in counter for skytam priority track. Business seat configuration for Korean Air is 2-2-2 in the upper deck of A380. Lie-flat bed style of seats but little hard, and no additional light-weight mattress is provided like Emirates. No suite like seats like Asiana or Emirates. New airplanes purchased by Korean Air such as B747-8i, B777-300ER, or A330-300 are equipped with suite like business class seats. However, business lounges in the front and back section of the business section on the upper deck of A380 is a nice touch. Constant care by stewardess in the back side lounge providing various snacks and drinks. Service-wise, it is one of the best airlines similar to the services of Asiana, Singapore and Garuda. Food is also excellent offering either Korean or Western dishes as the main course. They even offer Korean style breakfast menu, and I think it is a nice touch. In-flight entertainment could improve with more movies and tv channels of different countries around the world. Departure and arrival time from ICN-CDG was punctual. Service provided by attendants were very attentive and courteous and tried to meet every needs of customers.

### "great inflight entertainment"
Sydney to Seoul with Korean Air. Great inflight entertainment and you can use your own headphones, also usb and power sockets to charge your devices. Food was decent and crew was nice and attentive. They cleaned the toilets every so often and passed to pick up trash from seats (like empty bottles). Seats comfortable and the head rest could be configured in multiple positions.

### "would recommend Korean Air"
Manila to Atlanta via Seoul with my 17 months old daughter. The plane was clean, seats for me and my daughter were comfortable. The food was nice, even the snacks served. If passengers are asleep when they're serving food they don't wake them up just to tell you food is served. It was tough travelling with a child and she was crying much of the time in the entire flight, she was grumpy and squirmy. There was one attendant helping me in entertaining my daughter - she was so nice to us. I would recommend Korean Air.

### "never fly Korean air again"
Korean Air totally screwed me on my last flight. I purchased my ticket online through their website and for some reason they put my name in backwards for one half of the flight the (half going out). When I got to the airport they wouldn't let me check in at Alaska Air. When I called customer they told me that the name couldn't be changed and that all the flights were booked (thanksgiving). I was left sitting with my wife and 9 month old son in the ticketing terminal for 3 hours on the phone with customer service until we eventually missed our flight. You would figure that after all that they would be willing to help get us on a flight the next day (or the next week) but instead they only gave the option to cancel the ticket outright with a $200 cancellation fee (for each ticket, $400 total) that they claimed they had no ability to waive. All of this is in addition to the issues we had just getting the tickets to even complete on their website. For some reason adding an infant to the reservation causes the reservation to charge the card then cancel the ticket. It took over 5 hours with customer service just to get the tickets purchased correctly. Even after all of that customer service time they still made an error with my name. I flew with Korean Air 3 months ago and do not have this many issues. But thanks to my horrible experience and the horrible customer service, I will never fly with Korean Air again. My trip was totally ruined because of them. If you are someone reading this and choose to use Korean Air I would highly recommend booking through a third party site like Travelocity or Priceline to avoid their awful website and awful customer service.

### "certainly use them again"
This was my sixth time with Korean Air to New Zealand and my preferred option. London to Seoul returns were only 70% full so had 3 seats to myself both legs which made for very comfortable flights. Seoul to Auckland flights both full, but comfortable enough seats and good leg room. The food service was fine - the Bibimbap is always my choice with hot pepper paste to spice it up and very good. Proper cutlery and glasses a good touch. Drinks offered but spirits not on the carts and had to be fetched from the galley, wine offered and they came round to top up. Don't usually bother with inflight entertainment, but the range offered didn't seem stand out, but USB port available on seat back to charge a phone was useful touch. The standout are the cabin crew. Courteous, polite and consistently good. There is a genuine feeling that they are pleased to be of service to you. And the bonus for me was that on the return as there is no same day connection from Auckland to London the airline puts passengers up at a 5 star hotel, this time the Central Park in Songdo, 30 minutes from airport. The transfer was efficient, easy instructions for what to do on arrival in Seoul. The hotel was fantastic, dinner and breakfast provided on an as much as you like basis, and the room was amazingly comfortable, a nice bonus to break up the long journey home. Highly recommend Korean Air and will certainly use them again.

### "should learn service"
Seoul to Washington with Korean Air and bad service. The flight attendant provided worse service that I never had on any other airline. When ordering a bottle of water, the FA is ignored it then I have to walk up to the galley to get it. At the same time, a Korean lady sits next to me ordering a bag of peanuts then she gets it right away. Is Korean airline preferred to serve the customer speaking Korean language instead of English? On top of the situation, the FA who made the mistake did not apologize. Korean Air should learn service from All Nippon Airways.

### "a pleasant surprise"
Tokyo to Amsterdam via Seoul Incheon. Got rebooked on these flights after a KLM cancellation. Although this itinerary took longer and was not non-stop it was a pleasant surprise flying Korean Air for the first time. Although seats were hard, legroom on the B777 was among the most I have seen in economy, and the same as comfort seats on KLM. Catering, from ICN to AMS was excellent, both in quality and quantity, with real cutlery and glassware. AVOD adequate, selection could be a bit larger and more varied. The standout in my opinion were the lovely crew. Their English (in contrast to the pilots) was excellent, and service was personal, smiling, with attention for detail. All in all everything what a flight attendant makes a great host. I will choose them again for long haul flights.

### "everything went smoothly"
Seoul to San Francisco with Korean Air was one of the best flights I've had. Everything went smoothly, economy seat was comfortable, staff friendly and attentive, entertainment was great, and the food was really tasty. An excellent experience and I would fly Korean Air again.

### Korean Air customer review
Mumbai to Seoul with Korean Air. BOM-ICN, online check-in and seat selection worked well. Check in smooth, but KE only allows 1 check-in bag, you need to pay for the 2nd one (other airlines, SQ, TG, CX, MH  from BOM are more generous in this regard). Boarding was smooth. Aircraft looked oldish, cabin clean and good legroom, but seat not very comfortable, toilets well stocked but clearly aged. Cabin service excellent, crew responded to requests promptly. Special meals served as requested - a snack after take off (a small fruit platter for VLML was very welcome) and a meal before landing. Crew came round with drinks a second time after the meal. Their price, service and time of flight (shortest for this sector) makes them an attractive choice.

### "staff helpful and nice"
A 12 hour Korean Air flight and economy received amenity packet which is great. The IFE had a big range of movies, music and TV shows to enjoy and live BBC news. Next to the screen was also a USB charger. Food was mediocre having a choice of soup or cupped ramen soup. (The stuff you buy at 7/11)  Staff was helpful and nice. I was not feeling like dinner at the time when they were serving it and asked if I could have it later and they said no problem. I spent a fair ammount of time in the back of the A380 chatting with the cabin staff. The interior of the AQ380 cabin was nothing special. The seats were comfy but it was economy and comfiness has its bounderies.

### "better than expected"
Flew Korean Air from Brisbane to New York via Seoul Incheon return. The food was great, entertainment top knotch, service impeccable, and the seats and legroom were better than expected. All in all a great experience. I'd recommend Korean Air.

### "I do not recommend to fly"
Ulaanbaatar to New York via Seoul Incheon and I do not recommend to fly with Korean Air. A terrible cabin service, and staff do not speak English. Also, Korean Air policy seems to be different according to the route  fly - when I took a flight from Mongolia to Korea, the staff are almost getting mad at passengers not for any reasons (asking them to put the lugguage quickly even when they are not helping them). Lately however, when I took a flight to USA, the cabin crew become much more friendly and provided higher quality service. As a 4-Star airline this is completely unacceptable. We don't want to pay and have a bad service in turn.

### "I was changed to a center seat"
I checked in online for my Korean Air flight, and reserved an aisle seat. I confirmed this again when I checked in my baggage with the counter staff. However when I sit in the aircraft, I was changed to a center seat. Why did the airline never inform me after I stress two times I require to sit at an aisle area. I chose to take a more expensive flight and I get a budget flight service.

### "Friendly crew and sincere"
Korean Air from Singapore to Incheon, operated by a new B747-8. Connected in SIN after flying in with different airline. Check in staff at transfer desk a bit clueless. Korean Air uses SATS Lounge in SIN. Not the best Lounge and shared by a number of airlines. Shower rooms dirty. Boarding on time. Friendly crew and sincere. Good food. Plane was clean and crisp. Comfy seats and good IFE.

### "extremely pleasant staff"
One of the best economy class flights I have had on Korean Air, from Sydney to Seoul Incheon. Extremely pleasant staff and good food. My complaint was the seat cushion was a bit thin, and I kept having to shift my weight to prevent pins and needles. But plenty of leg room.

### "staff were sincere and professional"
Korean Air from Seoul Incheon to Singapore. Check in fast and friendly. Security at airport was crowded but efficient. Immigration at Incheon Airport a breeze. Used the Korean Air Prestige Class Lounge near Gate 11 at ICN. Welcoming staff, not a large spread of food, but what was there was tasty and fresh. Drink selection was poor. Good wifi. Genuine and sincere welcome by staff. Good traditional Korean Meal for lunch followed by ice cream. Nice IFE and comfy seat. Staff were sincere and professional. Hit some rough air inflight but all went well. Nice snack before landing. Arrived into SIN 30 minutes early. Perfect flight with KE.

### "value and quality for the money spent"
Our experience with Korean Air (Brisbane to London via Incheon return) was superb, and matched anything we have encountered flying with any other airline. All the flight attendants were polished, professional and on top of their game. Their service standards were of the highest order and met every expectation. The food was of good quality and sufficient in quantity, and was served with real cutlery. A never ending supply of coffee was available on request. The seats were reasonably wide and comfortable for economy class and there was plenty of leg-room for a tall person like myself. Unfortunately, the range of inflight movies included too many blood and guts titles. There were insufficient popular quality movies of other genres that would entertain mature adults who don't appreciate or enjoy watching death and destruction, especially at altitude. The pilot of the flight from Seoul to Brisbane was particularly good because we knew from previously observed satellite weather maps that there was a powerful typhoon in the area, (it later smashed Japan), and we had to pass through that and at least one other large area of turbulence. They gave us a comfortable flight when we thought this was not going to be possible. Another plus with this airline is the 19 hour layover in Seoul on our travel from Brisbane to London. We received overnight accommodation at the Hyatt Grand Hotel close to the airport. The accommodation was top class as was the dinner and breakfast. My only other negative is to do with the daytime flight over Russia from Seoul to London when flight attendants insisted the window shutters be closed so that others could sleep. Wide awake, I would have liked to look at the clouds and scenery outside but accept the collective good was more important that my own preferences. I ended up watching Casablanca and reading a book instead. With only one stop and just over 20 hours in the air both ways I consider Korean Air provided a quality service with a reasonable standard of comfort for an economy class passenger. I would fly with Korean Air again. We received value and quality for the money we spent.

### "had a window seat with generous leg room"
My first time flying with Korean Air, from Seoul Incheon to Hong Kong and I am well impressed. The check in took some time as Incheon airport was so busy, but most desks were open. Annoyingly I could not check in online for some reason as they needed to verify my credit card. I had a new card so was sent to the ticketing desk for paperwork and a refund on the old card and transferred to the other card. Boarding went fast and I had a window seat with generous leg room and I am 183 cm. I ordered the Bibimbap ( Korean dish) and was not let down. The girl beside me had the other option that did not look very good. Thy have a nice selection of drinks,  wine was good and a cognac. Baggage very quick out in Hong Kong and no passport queues. The staff were very nice and Korean Air will be one of my choices in future

### "most legroom I've encountered"
Korean Air check in at Seoul Incheon was easy. Flight was on a new Boeing 737, most amount of legroom I've encountered in economy on a 737. Aircraft was clean and well presented, blankets provided for a short haul flight. Hot meal of very good quality. Cabin crew are a stand out on KE, extremely friendly and smiling. One of the best short hauls flights I've taken. Still one of my favourite airlines.

### Korean Air customer review
Minneapolis–Saint Paul to Kuala Lumpur via Seoul Incheon with Korean Air. Ground staff send me to the wrong terminal for my connection so the plane had to wait for me while I did a run between terminals. This was frustrating but they did everything they could to get me on the plane which I appreciated. Staff on this Korean Air flight were exemplary.

### "customer service is so unprofessional"
I've been flying with Korean Air for over 15 years. I had nothing to complain until yesterday. My fiancé purchased a ticket for me from New York to Korea a few months ago. I had to change my departure date and called yesterday afternoon. There was a fee of $125 to change a date and they said it had to be paid by the cardholder who paid for the ticket and the person had to call. My fiancé called around 7pm to make a payment. They asked him questions to verify his and my info and put him on hold for 15 minutes and then said they'll call him back in 45 mins. They did and asked the same questions and put him on hold a few times. Then they said they'll call in 30 minutes. Never did. My fiancé called and they finally went through the payment after spending 2 hours. It's so ridiculous. I called to complain and the representative I spoke to,  cut my talk and transferred me to his manager. The manager never apologized and said its normal to wait up to 24 hours to make a payment. If you have time to waste, go fly with Korean air. Their customer service is so unprofessional.

### "cabin crew were on the ball"
Tokyo Haneda to Seoul Incheon with Korean Air, The check-in was very efficient and went smoothly. There weren't many business passengers, but cabin crew were still on the ball. The seat was a little hard to manipulate with sticky buttons, but was very comfortable. I would recommend flying Korean Air.

### Korean Air customer review
I did a round trip to Ulaanbaatar from July 23-Aug 7. The following two gripes about business class. 1) As I have read with other reviews, the business class seats are not truly lie flat. There is a headrest-pillow attachment which is fixed in place and it really prevents a comfortable lie flat position. The area in the seat shell is also too narrow for the upper portion of your body (I am 5'9' and 135 lbs) and you can not comfortably rest on your side. I have flown Air New Zealand business and their seats are fabulous. They have a seat that flops forward creating a flat surface which is then covered with a mattress. They also give you a quilt cover instead of a blanket. 2) The flight is anywhere from 12-13+ hrs depending on direction. The first meal is served after take off which is fine, however the second meal came approximately 6 hrs before landing. This only allowed for 4-5 hrs of sleep if you wanted to have both meals. There is not reason that. The second could have been served 3 hrs before l a doing allowing at least 6-7 hrs sleep with enough time. For the flight attendants to get things cleaned up. 3) The choice of food was off. When we left Korea at 12.55am they served dinner. 5 hrs later they served a meal that resembled a lunch. It would have been better had they waited until 3 hrs before landing (at JFK at 10am) if they served breakfast.

### Korean Air customer review
The aircraft operated from KUL to ICN was a B777-300ER which coincidentally turned 4 years old on the day of my flight. Although the configuration was 3-3-3, the seats felt rather cramped due to the premium cabins covering half the aircraft which surprised me. The Asian vegetarian meal I ordered was great and staff efficiency was excellent. Inflight entertainment only featured Korean, Japanese and Chinese films in addition to Hollywood which I felt was rather limited. Would have been better if there were other language films such as Indian on board since KE recently announced its intentions to expand in India. Transit in ICN was hassle free and easy to locate gates with lots of shopping and Korean cultural experiences. ICN to CTS was a brand new A330-300 and felt way more comfortable than the B777-300ER as I heard the premium cabin is one of the smallest in Korean Air. Overall a good experience and would consider them again.

I flew Korean Air for the first time. The A380 seemed surprisingly quiet inside. I had a boy sitting beside me who vomited during the trip so that kind of things but the cabin crew were helpful with him. Food was probably their weakest point, though I will take comfort on a plane any time over food. I don't like Seoul airport but Korean staff were very helpful and answered my questions. The plane got to Seoul late and I had a half hour to get to my next flight but they helped me get to my next flight. Overall I'd recommend them over most other airlines.

### Korean Air customer review
Seoul to DFW (Korean Air, flight #31 on July 9th) was the worst flight of my entire life. There was intolerable turbulence almost without stop for the first three hours of the flight and continued with high frequency throughout the entire  flight. It wasn't until they finally ascended to 39000 feet over halfway through a 12 hour flight that the turbulence smoothed. I am not a nervous flier and have flown all around the world on various airlines but this was so uncomfortable.

### Korean Air customer review
Flight on time, friensly staff and comfortable seats. I am 191cm and I didn't have any legroom issues on this flight. Entertainment system is very up to date, screens wide. Food however is just average though.

### Korean Air customer review
The check-in process was fast and easy. I travel with an instrument and rather than making a fuss about it, they tagged it so I would get by even more easily. The food and beverage service was superior to any airline I have flown. The cabin crew were friendly and staff quickly responded to any request made. The layover in Seoul was easy and everything left on time.

### Korean Air customer review
The planes are new and well kept. The A380 was a dream with a tomb like silence in the upper deck. The service is as good as any Middle Eastern airline and the connections to places like Vietnam from New York are amazing. The trouble is that they ruin it all with the transfer desk in the Seoul airport. After a relaxing flight, you arrive in Seoul at 5 AM and are tossed into a seemingly endless maze of travellers who are forced to go through security all over again to transfer flights. There are no special lanes for business or first class. Poor families with babies are also tossed into the cauldron. In an otherwise well thought out and spacious airport, it's appalling that they can't get this one part right.

HKG-ICN return, cabin in in 2-4-2 configuration. Cabin clean, seats comfortable, toilets well stocked. Special meal (VLML) served promptly and well done, followed by ice-cream on one leg. Crew came by with drinks during the short flight. Flight was more than half empty. Huge check-in line at Incheon though it moved quickly, but check-in still took over 30-40 min.

### Korean Air customer review
Flew from Zhengzhou CGO to Incheon ICN and then Vancouver YVR. Received decent ground service at CGO, no waiting at the check-in counter and customer check, aircraft was a newly decorated 737-800. Main course meal served inflight and was a surprise since it was a morning short-haul flight. Flight was on time both for takeoff and landing. Have to say that the landing was terrible, hard and banked. Int'l connection at ICN was smooth and did not take more than 30 minutes. Korean Air staff was available during transfer. The flight to YVR was at that time a 747-400, which was aged but carefully maintained. Cabin was cold for me but extra blankets were available. Provided toothbrush kit and slippers even for economy class. Cabin crew was not good enough at English but well enough to provide services. Two meals were served and both were good. The flight itself was on time and the captain was of great professionalism, communication with cabin was made after takeoff and before landing in Korean and English, which was a nice touch especially on Asian carriers. In-flight entertainment system was available on both segments. Did not use much because the touch screen was aged and its reaction was slow. Overall very satisfied, however the fare was a bit too high, so I will give 9 out of 10.

I recently flew KE867 and KE868 from ICN to Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia). The flight attendants on these two sectors worked very hard. The aircraft's were A330-300 and the return flight was full. The amount of cabin baggage taken in by the passengers on board wouldn't have been allowed on either the American or European airlines. Most of the flight attendants were females and for the life of me I don't know how they were able to lift the heavy cabin baggage and put them up in the overhead lockers. Throughout the flight the flight attendants were cheerful and smiling. As for the food, cleanliness and other aspect of the travel on those two flights I give Korean Air 5 Star plus.

LAX-ICN-SIN and back on May 6 2015. My wife and I flew Korean Air for the first time and was amazed at how professional and efficient the flight staff were. The flight left on time flight attendants were well groomed attentive and smiling. Lavatories were cleaned and roomy. Seats were very comfortable. Good choice of recently released movies and my favorite TV shows. Food was excellent. We requested a certain kind of food and we were very happy with what we got. Ground crew were very helpful with our transfer and they speak excellent English. Overall our experience was excellent.

### Korean Air customer review
First class from TPE back to JFK via ICN. TPE-ICN is on A330 good service and attentive cabin crew really shine and made a big difference on a relative poor catering experience. ICN-JFK is on A380 they couldn't maintain the same outstanding standard as the previous segment. Food and drink still not great. First class seat plan on A330 is same as business class with marginal wider seat. Though they are both lie flat beds and in 2-2-2 configuration First class seats are much better padded and better finished. Upon being seated one of the cabin crew asked me if I need anything to drink. Once I told them I needed some water my water glass was never empty from then on. Food and wine selections are not limited but the crew make up for it with the great service. On the contrary KE 081 ICN-JFK on A380 was a disappointment. The champagnes on board Perrier Jouet 2002 is a good selection but was being serve at a lukewarm temperature. In general food is the weakest link. The entrée ribs I ordered were not available so I was forced to change to fish which was too dry. I tried both the Korean and Western soup but they were tasteless. Salad was indeed fresh and prepared on site which was a bright spot of the whole meal service. The cheese and dessert was ok. The light meal before landing is Korean style cold noodle which was not to my taste at all. To arrange a cold noodle meal before landing JFK at 11am is quite eccentric in my opinion. I would much prefer a hot and full western breakfast on this flight after a good nights sleep. I was also surprised at the midnight snack of spicy instant noodle. All in all it is a huge disappointment to fly A380 First Class from ICN to JFK.

GRU-LAX and LAX-GRU. I always use Korean Air to travel from São Paulo to Los Angeles. It is more expensive but it is worth it. The best economy class I have ever experienced. The seats aren't great but for economic class standards it is 5 stars. Service is superb flight attendants are super respectful and helpful. Food is good free wine and others. Pilots are well trained and never had any problems during flights.

### Korean Air customer review
SGN - Tokyo - SGN in economy. Korean Air offered the usual excellent flight from check in to debarking at the end of the trip. I've become very fond of their 3 - 3 - 3 arrangement in the 777. The ground and inflight crews of most other airlines could take lessons from their colleagues at Korean Air. We usually fly Korean to the USA every summer. This year Cathay's price is much less. I'm looking forward to comparing the experience.

### Korean Air customer review
AKL-ICN-LHR April 19th. We fly this route each year and have travelled with Korean for the past 6 years. Flights were good and on time though seating on the 777-200 from AKL to ICN is not as comfortable as the 777-300 ICN-LHR is fit for purpose. Food is good but limited and I always enjoy the steak. Cabin crew are particularly helpful as we require assistance. The stopover hotel at Incheon is so good and included in the fare and does help break a long and tedious journey.. The assistance provided at AKL and more so at ICH for disabled passengers is fantastic speeding you through the queues at Immigration and customs. I only which it was good at LHR where it is atrocious but that is not the fault of Korean but the contractor. We shall be booking again soon for our return to New Zealand in December and Korean will be our choice.

### Korean Air customer review
JFK-ICN-CGK vice versa. I like the leg room provided although it was an old plane (A330 ICN-CGK-ICN) and the food was excellent. IFE was quite good with wide range of movies and music. Luckily I got the chance to try its A380 from JFK to ICN. Unfortunately the stewardess's English fluency was somewhat slightly below standard. Other than that Korean Air is my first choice for Trans Pacific flights.

### Korean Air customer review
I live in DC but flew out of NYC to MNL and TPE via Incheon to take advantage of the lower fares offered out of JFK and to fly the A380 on the NYC route (vs 777 on flights to Dulles). I had flown EVA Air 777 JFK to TPE a few months prior and Y class seats on the Korean A380 definitely felt more spacious both in terms of pitch and seat width. And the more generous headroom on this aircraft was also noticeable. I also appreciated that the Korean lunch/dinner option (usually a pretty healthy bibimbap or some variation thereof) always came with soup and the snacks between meals - fruits chips chocolate hot ramen and/or hot sandwiches - were filling and tasty. The attendants treated customers with respect. Flight attendants were proactive helping parents with babies. I also thought the attendant uniform and the overall branding and color scheme of the airline were quite stylish and appealing. The AVOD movie selection was comparable to EVA but not as good as Cathay or Singapore. The only downside to the journey was the horrendously long and slow-moving check in line in Manila. Online check in was out of commission so I arrived at MNL a full three hours before the flight and completed check in with only 50 minutes to spare. But I suspect this had more to do with the poor infrastructure at this particular airport/terminal than Korean Air. Incheon is a wonderful airport for with lots of pleasing amenities for extended layovers so I would not hesitate to fly Korean (or Cathay for that matter) for future transpacific flights.

Tokyo - Seoul 7 April back to Tokyo 10 April. First time on Korean Air. Excellent legroom in Economy and large comfortable seats. Hot tasty meal served both ways on this 90 minute flight by pleasant and responsive flight attendants. Overall excellent experience. Would definitely use them again.

### Korean Air customer review
First time on Korean Air and very impressed. ICN-SYD flight KE121 seat 9H. The cabin crew were exemplary and very diligent in their tasks nothing was too much trouble for them. The food was excellent the only drawback was the lack of a decent wine service during dinner rather than being served I had to ask for a glass of wine. The seat was comfortable lowering down to being completely flat a bigger pillow would have been the icing on the cake. I will certainly fly Korean Air again.

### Korean Air customer review
ICN to HNL. I did this route a few months ago and was very impressed this time not so much. As usual the service was fast and efficient but the cabin crew seemed distant and lacked warmth. Food seat comfort and their Prestige class lounge at ICN are great so I will be back.

### Korean Air customer review
SYD-ICN-MAD. I always fly Korean Air. However the standards seem to be slipping a little bit and the price of fares have gone up. The food is a bit hit and miss and there is only usually one choice available. They also don't offer apple juice on flights? I've noticed the planes are starting to look a bit shabby and not matching competitor airlines. Flight from Sydney was on a very noisy and old A330 with masking tape holding some of the overhead lockers together. Seat covers tatty old purple blankets and aircraft didn't feel clean. I've also noticed the crew aren't quite as pleasant as they used to be particularly in meal service time. In the past the Cabin Manager used to monitor the service in economy but they do not do this now. Used to offer a drinks service every half hour (juices and water) between meals. However on both legs of my journey I was so dehydrated and had to ask for a glass of water. Korean also used to be tempting as they offered a free stopover in Seoul however they have changed flight schedules to avoid doing this. After the meal time the cabin lights were fully lit for 2 hours while staff tried to flog the carts of duty free. Sleeping was impossible as they no longer provide an eye mask. They also do not take good care of their frequent flyers. I was charged 100 euros for having 23 kgs instead of 20 kgs. This in spite of being a 'Morning Calm Member'. The toilets were also looking quite dirty on both legs of the journey whereas three years ago they were immaculate. They also do not welcome frequent flyers on board or offer them meals first as other airlines do. Also for a night time flight it is a safety regulation to dim the cabin lights however the cabin manager did not do this. All in all I've noticed a decline in standards in the past 3 years. Will continue to fly with them and hope they try to improve their standard so it is on par to the service they used to offer. I choose them because they are not the most glamorous but for their consistency (which seems to be declining slightly).

CDG-ICN-AKL. The CDG-ICN flight was cancelled the day before and the reservations staff were unhelpful and uninformative about the replacement flight. It took 3 staff at check-in to sort out the new arrangements and I was sent backwards and forwards between 2 counters as this was done. It took a long time. Both flights were absolutely full so the cabin crew while nice and helpful were very busy. The cabin was a bit too warm on the CDG-ICN flight. The food was ok.

FRA-INC-AKL and return in Business. 2 Adults 1 Child 1 Baby (3 seats). 777 to INC with new seating mid week flight half empty staff excellent. Great flight. Old 747 to AKL but in upper deck. Biz full but staff again friendly and attentive. Meals all good to average for Business class. Service excellent (they happily delayed our meal due to baby needs - feeding etc). Top ups and service during the night. Return trip was same level of service. Few words about 1 night stopover in Incheon Hyatt hotel. Korean Air handled it well. We were transferred inside of 10 minutes of registering. Hotel room + restaurant 5 star - fully recommended. My wife and I were very pleased with all aspects of Korean Air.

### Korean Air customer review
As fans of Korean Airlines we were slightly disappointed by our recent flight New York to Chiang Mai Thailand. The staff seemed extremely tired and stressed. One flight attendant appeared not to understand English! While these long hauls are tough on crew this is what they do. The cabins were too hot for comfort the seat bottoms worn thin the passengers at capacity. The food was dreadful. Really we don't ever remember being served anything like this on Korean before. While this is economy class this is not a cheap-o airline.

### Korean Air customer review
I flew on Korean Air on all my trips to and from the USA (2x a year) in the last 4 years and I must say that there has been disappointments this last few trips I have taken most specially on the quality of food being served. It came to the point that I just usually consume the salads and fruits and not touch any of the main course being served. A general overhaul of the menu can do wonders to loyal customers like me.

FUK-ICN-AKL return. Old 747-400 on duty for this flight packed to capacity. AVOD outdated and very slow on this aircraft my sons AVOD didn't work staff tried many times to reset but couldn't get it working got an apology at end of flight (Luckily had own gadgets). Service efficient and quick to bring out what I requested. Food average but can't complain. Flights to NZL are full every day in my experience why not get a newer aircraft on this route? Basically ticket was cheap and you get what you pay for.

Flew BKK-ICN-YVR on KE660/KE071 on 31st December departure from BKK was delayed by a couple who strolled onboard 15-minutes after scheduled-departure carrying 4 bags of Duty-Free cabin-crew were extremely safety-aware checking twice that overhead-lockers were secure both before takeoff and again before landing! A tasty beef-stew was the Western-food-option on both sectors I was very impressed at the way the cabin-crew took extra time to explain the menu and wine-options to individual passengers this was after all only in Economy! IFE not a wonderful choice but overall I see why this airline has such a good reputation and will definitely be flying with them again.

KE928 Rome to Incheon 11 Jan 2015. Online check-in available 24 hours prior to flight. At airport very helpfully friendly staff. Staff said he would meet us at gate and give us onward boarding pass through to Brisbane. Had assigned seats we requested. Gluten free meal g/f sticker put on back of seat. Drinks order taken in advance. Very generous leg room for economy. Drinks always being offered juice or water. Cabin crew always in sight. Answered call bells promptly not that we needed to use them. Safe flight even with some turbulence.

What used to be superior service has slipped dramatically. Have used Korean Air twice a year for the past 8 years to fly Canada to Thailand where we are expats. Customer service standards are lower food quality and service is poor. Was not offered a drink of any sort in 8 hours. Air crew did not know anything about transfers late departures on 2/2 flights. It is very disappointing to see Korean Air service dropped so much. Even the air crew does not smile anymore or offer assistance. 7 hours between meals no snack offered or available. They have lost my business especially after yesterdays lost luggage debacle. If you are looking for a quality flight don't waste your money. Cathay Pacific picks up where Korean Air has left off. Look for other airlines.

### Korean Air customer review
My wife and I flew from Las Vegas to Incheon (KE005) and Incheon to Bangkok (KE657) on December 17 2014. Check-in at Las Vegas was quick and easy. Staff were very professional and polite. Our aircraft was a Boeing 777 from Las Vegas and the flight was completely full. I was very disappointed in Korean's B777 33 in. pitch in economy seating. My knees were jammed into the seat in front of me the whole 12.5 hour flight making for a very uncomfortable trip. I am 6 ft. tall and 33 inch seat pitch is just not enough space for the 12 plus hour flight. It was also very difficult to eat from the tray table when it is jammed into your lap contributing to a very bad flight experience. Korean Air seems to be missing the point when they skimp on customer seat space to enhance their bottom line in profits. Seat space is my only main complaint about Korean Air's commitment to quality of service. I might add that KE657 was an older B747 and to my surprise offered more seat pitch in their economy seating in the 6 hour trip than on their B777's 12 hour trip. From now on my airline loyalty will not be based on price but on seating comfort. Maybe flying an airline with premium economy class may be my next choice.

KE124 BNE to Incheon December 9. Check in quick given requested seats for all passengers. Boarding went smoothly. Cabin crew helped with hand luggage. Bottle of water cushion and blanket in seat. Very generous leg room. Throughout the flight the cabin crew were constant with serving drinks and snacks. I required a gluten free meal so cabin crew put sticker on seat asked in advance about which drink I wanted with meals. On arrival at Incheon complimentary stopover with dinner and breakfast included. Would recommend for passengers travelling on to UK from Australia.

DXB-ICN-DXB. Being vegetarian I was really scared to travel in Korean Airlines after reviewing various negative comments about their food and beverages. However to my surprise I was served very tasty pure veg meals throughout the journey. The crew were extremely friendly and helpful. There were very limited options in entertainment section with only few new released English movies. Overall very great experience on Korean Airlines.

Flew BNE-ICN-LHR return. Excellent on all four flights. I have flown KE a couple of times before and it's great to see that their high standards have remained in place. Cabin crew are wonderful very attentive and friendly. All meal options were available on all flights and it's nice have proper stainless steel cutlery. Hot towels distributed and regular drink and snack runs made throughout the flight. IFE may be limited for some however it didn't really bother me. Seats comfortable and leg room is among the best for economy class. Bathrooms were regularly cleaned and well stocked. The overnight in Seoul is very well organised provided with 4-star accommodation and really helps with jet leg. I noticed lots of fellow passengers were impressed with the layover experience also. Korean Air is a great airline and I will continue to support them.

### Korean Air customer review
ATL-ICN-ATL on the A380 which is great aircraft. It is extremely quiet and in KE’s configuration spacious in economy with ample leg room. The crew were Professional hardworking polite and immaculately groomed. The inflight entertainment (AVOD) is excellent and the system is available for use even prior to take off. The catering was adequate for a long haul flight with two hot meals and a mid-flight snack provided though more frequent drink runs would have been welcome. The amenity kits with slippers are a nice touch. A minor criticism is the appearance of the duty free cart blocking the aisle after every single meal service. The duty free shop at the back of the A380 also seems utterly superfluous. ICN-CMB-ICN on the A330. Both flights were on time. Legroom was not as generous as on the A380 but adequate. The IFE is excellent. Crew were professional but lacking in warmth. Meals were disappointing – especially “breakfast” served at the end of a 9-hour flight when landing in Seoul – a glass of juice and a cold muffin. It felt as if KE's inter-Asia routes were a step down from their service to the US. Overall I was impressed with my flights on Korean especially with the proactive and helpful service provided by their call center in Malaysia even before my trip began.

### Korean Air customer review
I had the not so great pleasure of traveling on Korean Air from New York (JFK) to Seoul (ICN) Korea a 15 hour flight then a few days later to Hanoi Vietnam. I have flown other airlines internationally and have a good amount of experience to make comparisons. My flight departed New York around midnight which is when most people are tired and ready to get some well deserved sleep. A late dinner was being served around 1.30 am I was in a deep sleep at this time. I felt someone shaking me saying "excuse me excuse me. You need to put your seat forward please". Being shaken out of a deep sleep did not make me happy. I woke up initially wondering if something was wrong and found it hard to fall asleep after. I eventually fell asleep again. A few hours later I was woken up again in the same manner. At this point I was really upset and just kept thinking how annoyed I was with this airline. Airlines have the option to make the seat pitch on airplanes enough that it won't affect the passenger behind you when they put their tray table down for eating. Korean Air decided to put the seats closer so that they can add a few more rows this in turn means waking you up to put your seat back forward every time they serve meals. I will never fly Korean Air again there are too many options of airlines who space their seats far enough you that you can sleep with your seat reclined to enjoy your flight.

Flight from SEL to HNL on a DL Codeshare. Friendly check-in who gave me an exit row. On-time flight. Very service- minded and friendly crew. I have not seen any airline where they check the wash-rooms more often. Quite tasty Korean food and good choice of beverages. Despite of the fact this was an older 747-400 the experience was definitely positive.

ATL-ICN-SGN-ICN-ATL. I would definitely recommend this airline to somebody who doesn't mind about having inflight entertainment which is probably the worst among major airlines. Movies and music are very limited. That said the flight attendants are very attentive and English-fluent. Food is edible sometimes a bit hit or miss. The seats are not so comfortable on A330 since the aircraft is a little bit older. B777 and A380 are much more comfortable. The bathrooms at the back of the planes are often messy. To sum up I'll give this airline 3 out of 5. Since I flew economy class I do not demand much but there's room for improvement.

20/21 Sept KE 074 YYZ-ICN and KE 625 ICN-CGK. In spite of flying Economy Class my Elite Plus Sky Team Alliance status was recognized all throughout my 24 hour journey from Toronto Canada to Jakarta Indonesia. B777-300 aircraft on first leg had plenty of leg room with comfortable seat on the 13 hour flight. In-flight meals (3 choices) were very good. IFE had large selection. Cabin crew were first rate. The best duty free shopping experience in the skies. l had a 4 hour layover in ICN airport and enjoyed the Korean Air Business Class Lounge while in transit. 7 hour flight from ICN - CGK on A330 was equally comfortable with again great cabin crew. All flights departed and arrived on time. Korean Air is a great airline. I'm looking forward to my return journey in a few months.

### Korean Air customer review
Business class BKK-ICN-IAD. Both sectors 777-300. Seats ok but nothing special. Not actually totally lie flat and lots of sharp edges. I wished I had elbow pads. On the regional sector BKK-ICN blankets are thin as tissue paper and the pillows are tiny - not too comforting for an overnight flight. Website said dinner was served BKK-ICN but it is actually a breakfast service before landing (which left me hungry for the whole flight). Drinks are served in glasses slightly bigger than sewing thimbles (TG does the same). I'm surprised cabin crew do not all go on strike for having to run back and forth to refill minuscule little glasses. Ridiculous. IFE not much to write home about. TV comedy channel limited to four meagre offerings and very little programming for children. I was quickly regretting not having a fully-loaded tablet for the three year old I was travelling with. The crew quite obliging and responsive to requests. Cabin was clean. Lavatories were regularly tied up by the cabin crew. Check-in agent in Bangkok barked "passports" to request our travel documents. I reminded him that he might want to start with greeting his business class passengers with a smile and a "hello". He apologized nd after that couldn't have been more helpful. KE uses the AF lounge in BKK. It is well stocked with drinks and snacks and very close to the gate. On the other hand the Prestige Lounge at ICN their flagship lounge left me with flashbacks of a college cafeteria. Noisy. Constant clanking of metal carts of staff picking up used plates glasses and cutlery. Food offerings very meagre and what there was in terms of food looked just foul - overcooked not much left in the trays and generally unappetizing. Seating was tatty. In the area where I sat several seats were torn. Someone from KE should fly 50 mins over to NRT and see how ANA does its business lounge which is tasteful. well stocked upscale and tranquil. Both flights were punctual. Bottom line: for what there is out there in terms of business class products both on the ground and in the air I wouldn't be rushing back to use KE again. I'd rather have a really nice seat and decent lounges than ads with ramp model walking flight attendants with geometrically placed sticks in their hair.

JFK-ICN A380 r/t and KUL-ICN B777. Standard Asian service with mainly female crew FA. They have beautiful traditional uniform and polite service. All efficient with English. The 380 plane obviously new and clean. Many movie and TV channels but lacked channels for my six year old. Food was okay and nothing to shout about last meal was 4-5 hours prior to landing. No local drinks to sample except for tea. Seats in Economy are never good for long flights and my back started to ouch after the flight. No problems using KE again in the future if price is competitive as it was this time. Bought tickets one week before trip. Full flight from JFK 70-80% from KUL.

LHR-ICN-NRT Even though I am a Skyteam ElitePlus member I was not able to receive the services that I am supposed to be entitled to. With other Skyteam airlines I was able to receive services based on my status. In addition the seats were narrow and rather uncomfortable. Even though I logged onto the airline website just after the online check-in opened I was not able to choose either an isle or a window seat. At the airport I was told that travel companies book the window and isle seats beforehand. On a positive note the transit at Incheon was pleasant.

SGN to IAD at the end of June and returned yesterday. My first task after wakening when after I arrive in Saigon is always to once again commend Korean Air for a job well done. It seems they get better every year. The FA's were cordial professional and friendly; the check in and boarding crew equally so. Nice clean 777 -300s on all legs (SGN-ICN-IAD and return). There's no way a journey from Saigon to Washington D.C. is going to be completely easy but the staff of Korean Air make it as easy as possible. I look forward to flying with them again.

### Korean Air customer review
XIY-ICN-CDG last week. The first leg was onboard a 13-year old A333. Flight was on-time food was acceptable and service impeccable. The second leg was on a new A380. Unfortunately the check-in systems do not work for people from outside Korea and hence I got an aisle seat. This was disappointing as 99% of the time I sit by a window. It was interesting to note that the past month the flight had been 40-60 min delayed every day from ICN while arriving on time at CDG most of the time. The same happened to us and I learned that was because of heavy congestion at the airport. This should be fixed if you ask me. The flight itself was very smooth food was great and enough to drink. I'm surprised that they are a bit cheap on drinks not giving a can of soft drink but just a glass. Makes you feel less worth in many ways. Smooth landing at CDG was nice.

### Korean Air customer review
Thoroughly impressed. The customer service was first class the staff excellent and the planes were a joy to fly on. I am an American who has lived in Asia before and flown on Cathy Pacific JAL PAL ANA. I have to say I was excited to get to fly on the A380-800 twice during my most recent trip. I flew from the US Charlotte to Atlanta to Seoul then to Cebu Philippines. I flew on a 747 from Cebu to Incheon and was given an exit row seat during check-in. I am 6 ft 3 and the staff member asked if I would mind sitting in an exit row. She said there would be plenty of leg room for me. I was very pleased when I realized I was on the top deck with almost no one near me and even given a pod-like seat that reclined into a bed for the 4 hour flight! On the long flight from Atlanta to Korea which was over 14 hours the service was impeccable the stewardesses were nice and the food was good. I would highly recommend this airline. The movies and in-flight entertainment were also very good and a suitable selection with various languages. My flights were July 29 and I returned Aug. 12th. I will definitely fly Korean Air in the future!

### Korean Air customer review
I flew Bangkok-Incheon-Dulles return and was impressed as always. As an American who has lived in Asia for some time I have flown across the Pacific many times and I always fly Korean if possible. There are numerous entertainment options and the system is easy to use. The food and beverages are great. The only airline I have found to have better food is Asiana and that doesn't mean Korean food is unsatisfactory just that Asiana's is incredible for economy class. I have always had positive experiences with ground crew and FA. The service is pleasant attentive and prompt to meet my needs. On a previous flight that connected with an American airline the Korean ground crew went out of their way to address a mistake made by the American airline's staff. Economy seats are comfortable and more spacious than I expect for economy. Even when I have a sport coat to hang I find that I am not cramped - and I'm 6'1".

### Korean Air customer review
I flew from Brisbane to NYC on 15th July 2014. Flight was smooth. However the negatives: Their meals are not edible. I was served beef noodles which were overcooked and mushy I called an attendant and told her I could not eat it and she said there was no more chicken so there was nothing more to give. Drinks: They were slow to serve. Flight attendants did not co-ordinate the service to serve coffees when passengers were eating their desserts. Flight attendants speak English but are very difficult to understand. In fairness they do give you a smile which is good. Seats: Well I was in economy so I accepted that it was not as comfortable as business or first class. However it was painful when sitting. Seats need more cushioning.

LAX-ICN July 7 2014 on KE018. ICN-RGN July 8 2014 on KE471. RGN-ICN July 22 2014 on KE472. ICN-LAX July 23 2014 on KE017. Flew LAX - Incheon then Incheon - RGN. Return 2.5 weeks later. LAX - Incheon watched 3 great movies and a fun Korean drama. Most of Incheon - RGN and the return trip I slept. Staff left meal for me when I was asleep and it still tasted ok when I woke up and ate it.

### Korean Air customer review
LHR-ICN-LHR. I have flown this route a number of time with British Airways and it was with some reluctance I booked my most recent trip with Korean Air based on the schedule they offer on the service. Well I have to say that I was extremely impressed with the service. Less seats in the Business Sections mean the cabin feels more spacious and the seat itself was bigger and more comfortable. The service from the cabin crew was excellent very attentive and keen to ensure I was looked after. Plenty of choice on the in-flight entertainment and the food was definitely better than what I have experienced with other airlines. The only negative would be the lounges both at Heathrow and Incheon - they are not quite up to the standard in terms of food being offered.

KE0642 SIN-ICN May 12 2014. KE043 ICN-SIN May 18 2014. KE0602 HKG-ICN Feb 23 2014. KE0643 ICN-SIN Mar 2 2014. There was a strong sense of service onboard the plane. Flight attendants welcome you with a positive energy and friendliness. They are very attentive taking care of your needs. I remember a flight attendant finding me and thanking me for taking their plane. They didn't do this with everyone. A minor detail but is much appreciated is the multimedia system. You can start watching movies as soon as you take your seat. No need to wait until plane is airborne.

### Korean Air customer review
The flight was quite great. Mostly a smooth ride and very reasonably priced however the food was disgusting. I am a vegetarian therefore had special requirements. I also found that once meal time was over the air staff were very absent therefore making it awkward when you wanted water or another beer. All aside I would definitely fly with Korean Air again.

### Korean Air customer review
Flew the following flights round-trip ATL-ICN-DPS. KE036 - ATL-ICN 7/10/14. KE629 - ICN-DPS 7/11/14. KE630 - DPS- ICN 7/19/14. KE035 - ICN-ATL 7/20/14. I would not recommend taking a red-eye with Korean Air. For reasons unbeknownst to me they leave the neon lights on in the cabin for the first two hours of the flight when it's obvious the majority of passengers wish to sleep. When asked about this all they could give me was some canned "the captain decides this" response. Window seats are not comfortable as well as it is difficult to sleep in them. If you're a westerner In-flight entertainment is practically non-existent. If possible I would suggest using Virgin Australia for your Transpacific flights out of the US as the comfort of their aircraft cabin management processes and in-flight entertainment are far superior to KE.

SYD to LAX July 2nd on KE 122 and KE 61 then return on July 17th on KE 18 and KE 121. On all legs staff were friendly and competent and kept snacks drinks etc. available at all times. Aircraft was kept clean inflight entertainment top class and legroom excellent for me who is 6ft 5 ins. Food was adequate but only two courses offered. Take it or leave it. My first time with Korean and satisfied.

### Korean Air customer review
KE024 from SFO to HND via ICN on July 18-19 2014. I've been a loyal customer to Korean Air for the past 3 years. Despite living in Japan I would fly to Incheon just to fly with KA whenever I returned to the US. However I'm extremely disappointed with my most recent trip. I'm not sure if there was an internal reorganization or a cutback of some sort. From check-in to the business lounge all staff seemed irritated and overwhelmed and it wasn't even that busy. I always fly business class but I was certainly not treated as a business class customer. In my opinion the ground staff needed to be retrained in customer service.

### Korean Air customer review
Brisbane - Incheon - Narita - return. Out of the four legs 3 were delayed due to operational issues. Inflight entertainment selection is very limited. Aircraft cabin was clean and "fresh" economy seats uncomfortable on all A/C types. Inflight service was average with the crew very inattentive any a very bland selection of inflight meals. Korean Air Excellence In Flight? I don't think so. My personal opinion if you had a choice Korean Air are acceptable (just) but if you have the option try Singapore JAL or Qantas first.

### Korean Air customer review
Took Korean Air the first time from Singapore to Hokkaido and back. Was surprised that it only allowed 1 piece of check-in baggage which caused a lot of inconvenience for me and my fiancee. Plane was clean and the staff provided good service. Food could be better but still edible. The 1 check-in luggage policy really lowers my impression of the airline.

### Korean Air customer review
Flew from Chicago to Incheon and back last week. On both legs we were very pleased with experience. Service at check in counter is excellent. Cabin is meticulous and kept that way. Seats are comfortable for economy class with plenty of leg room even for tall person like myself. The staff are well groomed friendly smiling and attentive from beginning to end. Even after 13 + hours on board they look as fresh as ever. Puts average US frumpy flight attendant to shame. Food service was good as well with meals or beverages served every two or three hours.

### Korean Air customer review
MNL-ICN-LAX-YVR-ICN-MNL. Checked in at NAIA terminal 1. Check-in was fast tons of counters were open. KE flight 624 to Incheon was great. Given a blanket and a pillow together with headsets. They wake you up if you put a sticker on your headrest if its early morning breakfast. We arrived in Incheon waited 10 hours for our connecting flight with KE017 to LAX on an Airbus A380-800. Left Incheon at 3.30pm Korean time. They also had headsets pillows blankets and amenity kits though the amenity kits only contained slippers and a toothbrush. 2 hours into our flight they served us early dinner the food was excellent flight attendants were so kind and friendly. 3 hours after dinner they served food again every following 2 hours they'd go through the cabin and serve peanuts and beverages. An hour before we landed at LAX they served breakfast. Took our 2nd to last flight of trip which was Vancouver-Incheon flight 72. Service was the same to LAX. When we arrived back in Incheon we went through security for our final leg which was ICN-MNL we waited just an hour. Service on flight 623 was the same as on 624. I recommend Korean Air.

### Korean Air customer review
JFK-ICN-MNL. I'm usually a fan of KE but the Prestige service on the red-eye was not quite up to standards. They serve "supper" at almost 2.30 am when I think full dinner service should apply immediately after take off. You're paying big bucks here no one wants a lousy 1-course supper. Then breakfast after 4 hours. Then you get to the KAL Prestige lounge at 4 am and there's nothing no meals no people to clean no proper snacks. They should learn from Emirates if you are a major airline serving the whole wide world your lounge should be fully- operational 24/7. Very mediocre experience.

### Korean Air customer review
I flew Sydney to Seoul LAX through to Sao Paulo July 11 2014. First time with Korean Air and I am very impressed my trip was a dreadful 40 hours but it was made easier by the friendly and prompt service of the cabin crew who adorned their guests with smiles. The inflight food was good inflight entertainment the same. Only bad things were: Good legroom but harder than normal seats no salt and pepper with food and no transit directions at LAX.

### Korean Air customer review
KE 601 from Seoul to Hong Kong: On time somewhat bumpy ride but quite satisfactory in all respects. Crew served well special meal as ordered were friendly and willing to help. A330 cabin was clean spacious. Crew handled a bunch of difficult Chinese passengers well. But a notch below their Korean cousins Asiana.

### Korean Air customer review
SGN-IAD: The usual excellence in flight and on the ground. Helpful charming and professional staff. Spotless 777 ER from SGN to Seoul and from Seoul to IAD. More than adequate legroom. If only the guy in the middle seat hadn't insisted on taking half of mine! The Prestige Lounge in Seoul was however a disappointment offering meagre choice of cold food and very generic decor. But the coffee was terrific! Will use KAL again and again.

### Korean Air customer review
Travelled 3 times SYD-ICN FRA-ICN and ICN-BNE. All 3 flights lots of leg room. SYD-ICN the crew were fantastic continuously bringing soft drinks/water around. FRA-ICN on an old 744 sitting near the back and it was very noisy. Crew allowed many passengers to have carryon baggage on the seats next to them as we came into land. ICN- BNE similar to previous flight but a bit stricter with bags on seats. Flew out in May and back in June but very little had changed on the in-flight entertainment.

### Korean Air customer review
ICN-ZRH. Last month I moved from Korea to Switzerland. The fleet was Airbus 330-200. It was quite good but the problem was the bathroom. It seemed like a new plane but the smell of the bathroom was bad. However their service was really good. The AVOD contained various movies music and games. Also the seat has a USB outlet so it was possible to charge my phone. But the value for money was very bad. I know that a one-way ticket is quite expensive but paying 2000 USD for a 10 hr flight is unacceptable. I will use Qatar or Finnair instead of Korean Air.

### Korean Air customer review
Flew from Hong Kong to Paris via Seoul return in June. Great seat pitch. If you like Korean cuisine you will love the bimbimbap. Inflight entertainment is sufficient with large individual screens. What distinguishes Korean Air from other airlines is its cabin crew. All crews are very friendly attentive with above average English. Definitely recommend!

### Korean Air customer review
LAS-ICN-MNL-ICN-LAS. The flight left late Friday night which is great as it allowed me to work all day and still eat dinner and head to the airport for my flight. The aircraft was fairly new or at least it seemed new. The interior was clean and spacious. What I liked was that there is a channel that allows you to get a pilots view of takeoff or you can see underneath the aircraft while taking off. This channel does not stay on the entire flight but it is a pretty cool thing to see. During the flight they gave us a little travel kit with eye cover and slippers a toothbrush a a little thing of toothpaste. I know this is pretty common but it's a nice touch. On the Vegas-Seoul flight I had the Korean meal. They have a selection of Korean beers. The inflight entertainment has many options in English/Korean and Japanese. I was able to watch some pretty new movies. Each seat also had a USB outlet to keep your phone or tablet charged during the flight. I had this on all 4 legs but I guess is only on certain flights. I found the crew very friendly and full of smiles they are quick to assist if you need help or just want a drink. They come through the cabin frequently with water/OJ or juice and are pleasant to talk with if you aren't shy with them. My only complaint is this it's not Korean's fault as I also had this issue on ANA and EVA but the 777 is not designed with an overhead seat vent so I always get very hot and sweat on these flights as it's controlled centrally within each area of the cabin. Throw in 12 hours in the same seat and it can get pretty uncomfortable All in all I'd say a good experience on a high quality airline. I love that they fly directly to Vegas.

### Korean Air customer review
Flew economy RT from CGK to ICN. The A330 to ICN showed signs of significant ageing (yellowing interior worn seats filthy bathrooms). The B777 on return was generally comfortable. VOD was large and responsive but selection limited. Disappointed by the baggage allowance of 1 bag per pax (except to USA) additional bags $100. Flight attendants were direct and the food service was too long leaving finished meal trays on our laps for over 30 minutes. Overall my expectations for the inflight experience staff friendliness and efficiency were greater than what was delivered.

### Korean Air customer review
SFO-ICN-PEK XIY-ICN-LAX. Due to the many changes in itinerary aircraft equipment and seat assignments made by the airline I had 45 mins minimum connection time in Seoul which did work barely as the flight was on time and the connecting passengers were escorted from the arrival to the departure gate. The return leg departure time for the flight from Xi'an to Seoul was brought forward without previous announcement (although this is part of their terms of service). I had previously been obliged to change my itinerary to return to LAX instead of SFO when this flight had originally been re-scheduled to depart later. Now I find with the revised earlier departure that I could have taken the SFO flight after all and made my connection back to SFO. I did get a free pass though for the Prestige Lounge for the 3.5 hour layover. The return flight to LAX was on a packed A380 and the cabin staff were completely disorganized rushing individual meals from one end of the main cabin to the other. The meals were okay but not served up to the standard of their competitor Asiana Airlines. The traditional decorum of the cabin staff wore thin dealing with a huge Chinese tour group who had probably never flown before. The leg room is restricted by almost 2 inches due to the thick airline sales catalogues that they cram into the seat pockets. I was further delayed at immigration since the airline somehow had omitted to tell the US authorities about the changes in flight numbers.

### Korean Air customer review
CNX-ICN-LAX round trip ticket. Taxi to airport involved in a bad accident. 2 hour Police delay caused me to miss my flight at CNX. Due to a long layover in ICN I was able to book a flight on another airline to ICN in time to catch my flight to LAX. Korean Air refused to allow me to check in. Said that since I missed my flight segment from CNX-ICN my paid ticket was cancelled. I had to pay an additional $1400 for a one-way ticket to LAX. KoreanAir also cancelled my return tickets from LAX- CNX which caused me to purchase an additional return ticket. On a different airline of course". Korean Air refused to reimburse me for the round trip tickets they cancelled and kept the money. I had trip insurance for the flight but Korean Air refused to provide a statement that they did in fact cancel my tickets until after the insurance filing date had expired so I was unable to file an insurance claim. Korean Air caused me to pay the equivalent of 3 round-trip tickets. The customer service was terrible and their explanations changed with every coorespondence. Knowing that Korean Air can cancel paid tickets on any pretext and strand customers in a foreign country unless they purchase another ticket is a serious concern. I have flown Korean Air on several prior occasions and was always satisfied but I will never fly Korean Air again.

### Korean Air customer review
HND-GMP was purchased as a JAL codeshare. Korean Air product was excellent. Definitely a step up from our GMP-HND flight on an ancient JAL Boeing 767. The KE flight was on a 777 with AVOD and excellent pitch and clean cabin. Cabin crew pleasant polite and efficient. The food was normal Korean Air bulgogi. You have it a thousand times but it always tastes pretty good! The negative aspect comes in the codeshare experience. As we purchased on Japan Airlines website Korean Air effectively shut us out with our elite status - no Morning Calm number on the reservation no Morning Calm mileage no Morning Calm preferred bag tags. We were actually seated on the very last row on a 750$ RT Y fare class ticket. We checked in at two hours like all Koreans do and were told that was "the best seat. I do give Korean Air staff one negative comment. The baggage handling at Gimpo was the slowest I've ever seen. I believe that Korean Air should have understood their timing better. Our flight arrived at 10:15 but our bags did not arrive until 11 PM - and Gimpo Airport is tiny. As such we (and the entire plane) missed the last buses to Seoul/other areas and and to pay for an expensive taxi. I really feel that as KE is so customer focused that they dropped the ball on this one. I know that it's part of the risk you take but Korean Air is usually good about those kinds of things. 50 minutes should have been enough time to get bags and out of tiny Gimpo Airport. I've never code shared before but after this experience I am completely against it. Perhaps I miseducated myself but codeshares are not worth it.

### Korean Air customer review
BKK-ICN-LHR. It seems Korean Air are mostly using their still-substantial 747 fleet on regional routes rather than upgrade the business class to a full-flat standard as found on their more modern long haul fleet of 777-300ERs. So while the hard product is a little old-fashioned the aircraft type on the Bangkok to Seoul leg is still the Queen Of The Skies (although I think it depends on the day). With some decent snacks in the Air France lounge and a midnight departure a couple of meat lollypops and a green tea was enough for supper with sunrise came a full Korean breakfast. The six hour transit at Incheon sped by in the luxurious lounge. Shower facilities were particularly welcome. Descriptions of cabin crew on Asian carriers as robotic are exaggerated anyway but on the long daylight flight to London the hard working all-girl crew were approachable witty and kind as well as having excellent English skills. The bibimbap main course was extremely tasty and the second service before landing also good. Flat bed seat as comfortable for sleeping as my own bed. Surprisingly light on entertainment options but I was happy to read my book. We landed a few minutes early. Only complaint is that the airline has moved from T3 across the field to T4 which is neglected by the Heathrow Express train service into London. Great experience on Korean Air and will go out of my way to fly with them again.

### Korean Air customer review
Flown on the A380 from LAX to Incheon last October. Business class is located in the upper deck and the overall experience was something to repeat. Great service great IFE with a wide selection of movies and shows not only in English but also in Spanish and Italian. There is very nice bar in the back of A380 where a wide range of tasty and perfectly prepared Martinis are served. It's a good spot to meet some other fellow passengers and to exchange a few words. It reminded me of when traveling by plane had its glamour.

They were efficient friendly and helpful. If there was turbulence the captain gave us a warning right away. The leg room was good enough. Time of arrival was on the dot. Plus Incheon Airport was fabulous. Great shopping area. I wish I have a longer layover time. I highly recommend this airline to those who are flying to Asia.

### Korean Air customer review
Flew from Singapore to ICN and back in 777-300. My first time flying with Korean Air. Overall service is ok. It is the minimum what a premium airline would provide. My flight to ICN departed after 10pm and they served dinner at about mid-night. Only turned down the lights at about near 2am and woke us up at 4am to prepare for landing. No snack was served before landing at ICN. I would have preferred they serve us a snack after take off and breakfast before landing. The timing for serving food on the return flight was also a bit odd. Took off at 2pm and served us lunch at about 3.30pm. Then a snack at 5pm just before landing. Flight attendants also did not serve drinks throughout both the flight. Only during meal times. In flight entertainment was ok. Small movies selection. Took Singapore Airlines a few weeks before this flight. I must say SIA is a lot better.

Traveled ICN-FRA-ICN in 747-400. I flew this route several times last year. Seat comfort entertainment system check-in service and punctuality were all good.

LAX - Seoul business class Flight 62 evening flight. Not a good deal for the money but you don't have any choices other than Asiana. This flight was my most disappointing business class experience. The "supper` was the same as in economy (where my son rode) and it was beyond mediocre. During the flight the only snacks were cookies There was no bar available. The seats were not lie flat. To book a seat it was the usual KAL routine of having to wait 90 days prior to departure to snag a good seat. Not sure what I would advise other than flying to Narita on smoe other airline and connecting there. I think I'm done with KAL avoid KAL from LAX to Seoul.

Seoul Gimpo to Busan (PUS) from Busan (PUS) to Tokyo Narita (NRT) and from Kansai airport (KIX) to Paris CDG via Seoul Incheon (ICN). Crew very nice helpful and speak several languages (usually Korean English and Japanese). A lot of legroom and very large seats with a big screen with a large choice of movies from all continents and all new releases are available. I was also surprised to get a real breakfast and lunch for medium haul flights where I usually get a croissant with coffee. For long haul flights they propose 3 different meals. I wish that American and European airlines take Korean Air as an example.

KE704 NRT-ICN Biz Prestige class. KAL lounge at the NRT was nice looking at the entrance. Inside was barren. Almost nothing to eat but some rice cakes and cookies and drinks.

KE 654 BKK-ICN Biz Prestige Class. Seat was nice and very comfortable. The Biz class was limited to only few passengers. Nice FAs . Very limited food selection for Biz class. Only 2 shrimp sticks once on board and a breakfast prior to landing. One passenger asked for extra shrimp sticks but the answer was no. This is a very savvy Biz food service I have ever seen. Korean breakfast was a bland congee and not allowed to have bread.

KE 8659 ICN-BKK Biz Prestige Class. Comfortable seats. Interior design of the biz and first class was simple and looked cold. First class was empty. Toilet was stocked with only basic items like toothbrush etc but none of the luxurious items (no face mist no cologne). No amenity bag . Only one pair of slippers. Food was limited only Korean beef bibimbub or a beef steak. Would not be a good place for a non-beef-eater. Fruit came without cheese and crackers. Surprised by the very limit food choices and quantity in the KE Biz class. Nice FAs but did not really return to fill drinks.

### Korean Air customer review
Trip from Incheon to Atlanta was a pretty decent one. What do you expect from economy? Their customer service was nice. Most flight attendants gave what I requested. (Basically hot water and ramen were my requests). You can get woken up for meal service but there are stickers you can put on the seat in front of you to let them know whether or not you want them to interrupt your sleep. The seats are comfortable once you adjust to it and put a pillow on you. You can't seem to always adjust your seat to your will in economy. The in-flight entertainment had some good movies but not as much and not as diverse. You could only find like a few and that's it. The food is edible and nothing really significant. Overall I would recommend this if you want save a couple cash and sleep for most of the flight.

### Korean Air customer review
ICN-ULN round-trip for Lunar New Year. Surprisingly these flights were both 90% full and with their updated economy seating. They even had AVOD 3 the newest of the entertainment systems. Extremely clean brightly lit plane as always. For the first time in years of flying KE I finally felt the infamous hot cabin temperature. I called for an attendant who promptly said she would check on it and brought me a glass of ice water and then came back again to let me know she fixed it. I also witnessed a passenger get upset about a 20 minute delay at the gate and they brought the purser over. She kneeled down listened and smiled. The food was even a little different from the usual offering (different things came with noodles this time). Another quality experience with KE.

Flight KE124 departing Brisbane on Dec 15th 2013 and returned on KE123 departing Incheon on 9th Feb 2014. Korean Air offers the only service direct BNE-ICN. I found their flight OK in economy but as I am on the larger size I found the economy seats a little tight which is probably due to my size rather than the airline. In December 2013 I travelled Business Class and was impressed with the aircraft seating and inflight service. I will always travel Korean Air and will recommend.

### Korean Air customer review
Flew Business Class from ATL-ICN on A-380. Would not recommend any seats in forward business cabin area due to galley noise. Select a mid cabin seat. The staff are overly attentive to such an extent that they woke the entire plane at 3am to serve us dinner. It is the middle of the night and we still had 4 hours left of the flight. The food was passable at best. Bars at forward and rear of the aircraft were a waste of space and only an ad for Absolute. You need to bring your own noise cancelling head phones or turn the music up which is what I did. I would not recommend this airline.

### Korean Air customer review
NRT-HNL-NRT in business class. The problem with this flight is the age of the plane. It's a 747-400 and hasn't been renovated to their newest seats. The result is a very uncomfortable ride. Even in upright position it's shallow and hard. Recline mode is only a varying degree of slide. It's a shame because their new flat seats are not bad! The service and food were wonderful. Flying over I wanted to sleep and I requested not to eat the first meal. The FA suggested she save my meal for my arrival meal as it was the larger of the two. A brilliant idea and very thoughtful! On the return the menu consisted of beef pork and beef choices. I don't eat meat and the FA made me a vegetarian bibimbap which was delicious! The entertainment is limited and also not their best offering due to the old aircraft. I like Korean Airlines and would certainly fly them again on this route if the aircraft is updated.

Auckland to London return with a side trip to Japan. Flights between Auckland and Seoul were on older 747s but there is more legroom than other airlines. Entertainment was average and quite limited and generally worked well. Overnight accommodation on the way to the UK via Seoul was a bonus. Transport and organisation for this was very easy and efficient both at the airport and the hotel. Flights to and from Japan were on new 777 and 737. Meals were superb and the kids pack on this leg was much better than on others. Flights between Seoul and UK were good to - this time on newer 777. The Korean food on the long haul legs was excellent. Western meals and wine choices weren't so good. The service was excellent - very friendly and helpful and plenty of water and soft drinks supplied. Kids meals on the flights were vast which was good as lots of options were provided on the tray which was helpful as the kids could pick and choose. They were very well-organised with kids meals came and checked that everything was in order and were flexible if children were sleeping at meal times. Every check in was easy and quick boarding was straightforward and the children were well catered for - we were encouraged to board early with them. Transfers at Incheon were great. It is easy to see why this airport rates as it does - it is just superb. Our flight to Japan left from Gimpo airport (nothing like Incheon but fine) and getting there from Incheon was really easy. My only gripe is that while the one check in bag rule is enforced the one carry on rule is not. Lots of passengers wheeled large suitcases onto the plane in addition to bulky carry on bags and backpacks which meant that there was stiff competition for space in the overhead compartments and people were pretty ruthless about claiming their space. Overall Korean Airlines was a great option for us and we would use them again. They are extremely competitive price wise and are considerably cheaper than the next cheapest option. Having the stopover included between Auckland and the UK is a luxury particularly when travelling with children.

We flew from Heathrow via Seoul to Auckland had no delays good inflight entertainment food was better than expected air hostess's were very accommodating always smiling and pleasant. Trip on the way back was even better had a 20 hour stopover in Seoul and was put up in the Hyatt hotel which was fabulous and unexpected. I would definitely fly again with this airline.

Round-trip HKG-ICN. Hong Kong to Seoul: KE602 A330-200. Fast check-in on-time boarding and departure. Newly-renovated cabin very comfortable large touch-screen. Greeted with extreme politeness by cabin crew while boarding instant hospitality felt. The food was satisfactory and other snacks were up to standard. Great entertainment system great games as well. Seoul to Hong Kong: KE601 B777-200. Again prompt check-in and on-time departure. Cabin relatively old with small and un-touchable screens. The same politeness of cabin crew food was good. Remark: Some cabin crew had a slightly weaker command of English but most of them are capable of ordinary demands by passengers.

### Korean Air customer review
SYD-ICN-JFK-ICN-SYD. Economy class. Sydney to Seoul was a day flight on an ageing 747. Pet hate number one: all window shades had to be closed and lights turned off during the 10 hour day flight. Uncomfortable seat despite the generous 34" pitch. Limited IFE choices. Bibimbap is the only meal worth considering. My seat mates' western choices looked very pedestrian. Cabin crew mostly young with very limited English and all service seemed very rushed and chaotic. They did spring immediately whenever people rang the call buttons. Drinks (soft and hard) were half pours in 200ml plastic cups. Overnight ICN to JFK on a much newer 777 was more comfortable. Same level of clumsy but well-intentioned service. Some mediocre entertainment choices but on a newer and more user-friendly system than the 747. Seatbelt sign was turned on at the slightest hint of light chop throughout the flight. Cabin crew stationed permanently at the lavs directing traffic and ensuring they're kept reasonably clean. JFK-ICN on A380. Seats as comfortable as they get for economy class and like the 777 great entertainment hardware but limited choice. More bibimbap. More sips of drinks from small cups. Another day flight with enforced darkness. Quick and simple transfer at ICN. Paid lounge access upstairs for USD22 is a good option and free showers available to all passengers adjacent to the lounge. ICN-SYD back to the old 747. Bibimbap for dinner on departure. Uncomfortable seat. Same service not unfriendly just impersonal and very "green". Another pet hate: breakfast was served a good three hours out of Sydney and cleared up with two hours left to go so lights turned off and blinds to remain closed. If I had to do the trip again in economy class I possibly would consider KE for the mere fact of 34" seat pitch which really does make a difference and makes up for a significant number of soft product short comings.

ICN-CEB-ICN-PRG. Very good price about 20% cheaper than the second cheapest option. First leg almost empty Boeing 747 nice experience. Probably the best legroom of all economy class seats I have seen. Their 747s have IFE with AVOD however the screens are a bit dated and selection is not the best. Return CEB-ICN check-in in CEB took two hours just waiting in Korean Air line. Again 747 but this time about 70% full. Uneventful flight on time. ICN-PRG on Airbus A330 despite being seated in the poor row (39) which is just ahead of lavatories it was not bad at all. Again generous legroom (for economy) and proper recline even in this last row. Better IFE plenty of drink rounds (they have great juices but not so great wine) calls answered quickly. My only complain would be about the requested vegetarian meal which was served on all three legs but it was always the same combination of tasteless steamed vegetables. Together with easy transfer in ICN airport I definitely recommend KE in economy if price is good.

I flew with Korean on 10th December 2013 flight KE474 Colombo - Seoul Incheon. KE 17 to Los Angeles USA and back KE 18 on 15th Dec KE 473 16th Dec 2013 to Colombo. Though it was a long flight the way the staff/crew onboard treated you was excellent Very good friendly service and food was good. Please improve the inflight entertainment with more movies since its long flight.

KUL-ICN-KUL B777. On both flights only allowed 1 check-in baggage so I had to rearrange my baggage. As usual cabin was clean and good leg room for 6hr flight. FAs were professional yet service was not good as my previous experience. Food was average. Personal IFE system requires some maintenance.

Flew BNE-ICN-LAX JFK-ICN-BNE in November. This is my second trip with Korean Air this year and I am still very impressed with them. Service provided from the cabin crew is excellent nothing is an issue and always greeted with a smile. Aircraft are always clean tidy and modern. I loved the A380 so spacious the most room I've ever had in economy class! AVOD is great and meals are fine with regular water/juice runs throughout all flights. Korean Air is a consistent airline which I think is very important I will continue to support them as they offer a great product at a great price. I look forward to my flights next year and would highly recommend.

### Korean Air customer review
NYC-ICN on A380 ICN-BKK on 747. Upper deck on A380 just doesn't feel special way too large much prefer the feel of Korean Air 777. As usual some problems being understood by the crew but overall good. Bar at front and back totally pointless. Ugly to look at and limited drinks. Not somewhere you really want to sit. Painless 50min transfer at Seoul. 747 older product with old style angled seating but for shorter flight was ok.

### Korean Air customer review
Used Korean air's B777-300ER. ICN-SYD. Used Business class comfortable large seats and great crew service. It was really quiet. Lots of food selection to choose from but the steak was a little bit small. Also a large entertainment system.

B747 ICN to AKL Economy cabin is a 3-4-3 layout. Boarding somewhat chaotic at Incheon as flight was very full. Cabin looked a little bit drab and tired when compared to B777-300. Seats not quite as good as newer economy on newer planes in the Korean Fleet. Legroom was excellent. Inflight entertainment was extensive. Where Korean excel is the service received from the cabin crew very efficient and smiling steward was very pleased when I asked to try Korean Beer and provided extra snacks to accompany the beverage. Overall the experience was very good Western airlines should take a real good look at themselves Korean Air will be getting my business again.

10/17/2013 flight 94 and flight 667. 10/24/2013 flight 668 and flight 93. A great trip except for the seats. Probably wouldn't have been a problem if it wasn't such a long flight. But other than this it was very good. I can't say enough good things about the flight attendants. They were excellent always smiling and very attentive. I would gladly recommend.

### Korean Air customer review
Korean Air are fairly good except the fact it does not have any good frequent flyer program. One of the most aggravating facts is that their upgrade policy is very simple - no upgrades. The only way to be eligible for upgrade is if you buy a full fare economy ticket. And then you need to redeem 80000 to 120000 points (8 to 12 roundtrip transatlantic flights). Furthermore even if the business class is empty and the economy class is fully booked no upgrade none whatsoever (doesn't matter if you bought a full fare ticket). I fly with Korean Air around more than 10 times a year (long distance - 12hr one way) one can't deny the fact that Korean's fly relatively new aircraft the staff is polite and helpful etc. Yet when one travel as often as I do one would expect more in particular if you show such a loyalty.

I'm in the First Class Lounge in Hong Kong if you can call this a Lounge. it's a small room with a few very uncomfortable couches and there is no lounge toilet. If you need to use the Toilet you have to use the Public Toilet. I'm paying for a first class ticket I arrived for the flight 2 hours and wanted to unwind in the First Class Lounge and I have nothing to look at.

KE925 from ICN to AMS with A330-200. Fairly new interior with floor heating big personal screen with best interface that I've ever seen so far. Seating was also very good (34G) big legroom although my headrest could not be adjusted to my long height. We had no delay and the personnel were very friendly. Yet the food served was not good as flight attendants and PES unfortunately. The meat was dry as well as cod fish that was served later in the flight.

### Korean Air customer review
Flew from LA to Tianjin and return from Singapore to LA. The economy seats are the hardest of any I have ever flown and made it impossible to get comfortable on 11 plus hour flight. The food was not very good and best left uneaten. The stewardesses seemed like women out of Stepford Wives. All very pretty young and accommodating but not real.

### Korean Air customer review
Often fly KE 036 from ATL-INC then KE623 to NRT Manila. I must say I have been impressed with Korean Air. Their prices on business class have been almost half of Delta's. My most recent flight was on their new Airbus A380 service. The seats are the same as Prestige class on the 777ER but there is an added storage compartment next to the seat that can hold your laptop and pillow and blankets. The food and staff on Korean are excellent. Prestige class is the entire upper deck of the A380. There are lounges at the rear and front of the upper deck. The forward lounge has assorted vodkas and martini mixes and is self-serve. At the rear of the plane is another larger lounge with an attendant serving as bartender with a larger selection of drinks. Probably my only cons are the pillows and blankets are more comfortable on other international carriers I have flown. Also I now take extra bottled water on the plane with me and use the large storage compartment of the A380. They tend to be stingy with the water. Tiny glasses and it is impossible to get them to fill them more than half way. It is the same with the wine. But it is better than getting dehydrated on those long 21 hour journeys.

SIN to ICN return. KE644 and KE641. Boarding was quite fuss free and was boarded according to seat number aka from the back of the plane to minimize disruptions. Cabin Crew friendly on a full flight. Limited drinks offered upon take off. But if you require other drinks you will have to ask the cabin crew. IFE was average and some broke down during the flight. There were 3 choices usually Korean Western Asian. Food portion was like a kids meal. Small. Though I have to commend that the food was delicious despite a small portion. Cabin Crew messed up a little but cleared and provided professional service recovery. Return leg was amazingly different from the incoming flight into Seoul. Snacks were served prior to landing and includes a wide array of snacks which was good. Along with a cup of Ice cream which was refreshing coupled with cabin crew who were friendly smiling on both flights to complete a wonderful experience on Korean Air.

### Korean Air customer review
Flew Auckland-Milan via Seoul and return 3 weeks later Amsterdam to Auckland via Seoul. All 4 legs were excellent especially the staff. Only had the fully reclining seat on the Amsterdam-Seoul flight 80 degrees on the other three. Time Korean Air updated all their business class seats in order to stay competitive. We pre-booked our business class fares 1 year previously when we received an excellent deal. Food on all 4 legs were good to excellent love the bibimbap although they ran out of it on the 3rd leg. Wines offered were excellent although only 2 choices each of red and white. All in all a wonderful experience and definitely will fly them again if the price is right. One thing Korea Air must do and that is to make its website much more user friendly were unable to pre-book our seats on-line and navigating around the web site is difficult. Still unable to check whether my frequent flyer points have been credited.

### Korean Air customer review
KE 036 from ATL to ICN. Aircraft was an A380. Business class seating is 2-3-2 configuration. Although I prefer the privacy of international business class where all seats have direct aisle access and the window seats are single seats. I had 22A a window seat on this flight and there was no one sitting in the seat next to me. The window seats on the A380 have storage compartments built into the fuselage below the windows. This is provides excellent storage space for personal items like newspapers pillows or amenity kits. The top of the storage compartment is good flat space for setting a drink or a laptop. Once I was seated the FAs came by with a good selection of English and Korean newspapers. One thing they did not offer was a pre-departure drink. I was in seat 22A which is near the back of the business-class cabin. Many of the seats in this part of the cabin were unoccupied so it was very quiet and easy to catch a cat nap. Right behind the business-class cabin is the lounge. This is a large area with a bar and couch seating by the windows. One of the FAs serves as a bartender. There is an assortment of the usual alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages plus a menu of special cocktails the bartender will prepare. The lounge was a great place to meet and talk with my fellow travelers. There is also a smaller lounge in front of the first-class cabin but it has no bartender. The seats are full flat and the controls were easy to operate. The entertainment system also worked well. The selection of movies and games was adequate but there was less variety than on other airlines I've flown. The pillow and blanket while adequate was not as nice as others for international business class. One thing that Korean Air did very well was the food. American Korean Japanese and Chinese selections were available. I tried the beef-tenderloin five-course dinner with a nice cabernet. The steak was actually prepared medium to medium rare. Other airlines I've flown have been unable to manage anything less than well done. The best part on any Korean Air flight are the flight attendants who are incredibly attentive pleasant and attractive. The FAs on this flight upheld that tradition well.

GMP-HND in economy on B777. Hands down the best economy class flight I've had in recent memory. Incredibly comfortable cabin with a remarkable amount of legroom large video screen and overall pleasant cabin ambience. More importantly the crew was absolutely exceptional - extremely efficient attentive warm and highly professional - about as good as it gets. I don't fly KAL much due to my status on Oneworld and perhaps I just got lucky but if this is typical for KAL they're owed credit for a great in-flight experience.

### Korean Air customer review
Paris CDG to Brisbane 12 Sep 2013. Generally good value with little to complain about. They provide a compulsory free overnight stopover in Seoul on flights to Europe from Brisbane. The hotel used is excellent. Transfers to and from the airport are quick and efficient. We have noticed that inflight service is not as good in 2013 as it was in 2012 they no longer offer spirits or beer you have to ask. However they only offer fruit juice and water. Wine is offered with meals. Seat pitch was good with a bit more legroom in economy than some carriers. Food is average for Asian carriers usually a choice of 3 main dishes including one they always offer traditional Korean pickled cabbage served with rice and vegetables with Korean chilli paste in a tube and sesame oil. Nice if you like Asian food but it gets a bit repetitive. The western style menu choices are satisfactory "plane" food fair average quality. Staff are friendly and helpful and most speak reasonable to good English. French is spoken too on the Paris flights. Korean code share with Air France so if you want to avoid Air France you need to specify that you only want to travel on Korean Air operated flights when booking. The only problems we have had (repeatedly) are with seat allocations when we have requested a center aisle seat to avoid the inconvenience of being in a window row of 3 as some planes have. Despite repeated assurances that they have noted our preference for a center aisle seat and put it into their computer systems for all the subsequent legs of a trip most times it had not been done they denied all knowledge and we had to persist vigorously to get what we had been promised. Overall we have been impressed by Korean Air after two round trips Brisbane to Paris and return and it they are continuing to offer competitive fares which is why we started to use them you can happily give them a try.

13 Sep 2013 KE 607 Seoul Incheon - Hong Kong. 28 Sep 2013 KE 614 Hong Kong - Seoul Incheon. As an expat I have been traveling and working in over 12 countries in the past 10 years and have traveled on just about every airline in the world. My last airline travel was on Korean Air and have to say it was the most satisfying flight I have experienced! From check-in to disembarking it was the most pleasant experience one could hope for.

I've flown several times on the TLV-ICN route (both ways). The airlines is excellent. The staff are always very nice and welcoming very efficient. The food isn't very good but not worse than other airlines. Drinks are being served several times during the flight and some times even a pizza is served. The entertainment system is one of the best with many choices. ICN is my favorite airport if a connection is required this is the place to do it.

### Korean Air customer review
Chose Korean due to reading about their above average legroom (34-35" in Economy). Auckland to Seoul in an older 777 which was clean but the entertainment somewhat limited in choice. Food was quite poor compared to other airlines the two western choices we had were below average and the Bibimbap was also average. Cabin crew were attentive and friendly great service and seemed to be in good spirits. Seats a bit dated but Korean's good legroom makes up for it. Nice to get an amenity kit with slippers etc. Seoul to London Heathrow in a newer 777 but again the journey was let down by the quality of the food and the limited range of movies and shorts although the system was newer and had a larger screen. Service and legroom excellent. Zurich to Seoul and Seoul to Auckland same as above. Had free stopover on the way up at the Hyatt which was great but on the way back they didn't offer the same sadly. Would use Korean again around Asia but to Europe they are lagging behind compared to other airlines. Their legroom is very good though especially for tall people like me.

Just returned from our trip to Japan. First and last we will travel with Korean Air. From NZ to Korea the aircraft was ok but old and the entertainment screen was low quality. From Korea to Japan our aircraft changed and the plane was much bigger and newer. The lounge was really basic and ordinary especially the one in Japan. On the way back we had a newer plane from Japan to Korea but the plane was so dirty. They didn't have enough of the food provided and by the time they got to me I just had just one option of eel. In Korea the lounge was really basic and by the time we got there there wasn't much food left. However the flight from Korea to NZ was good.

GRU-LAX-ICN-HKG Aug 2013. Cabin crews were efficient welcoming and very attentive. Check in service in Sao Paulo was managed by the airport and supervised by a few Korean Air staffs. The whole process was quick and smooth. Check in at Los Angeles was worse although the staff were from Korean Air. They were not rude but provided no greetings or smile not even a sorry when they misunderstood that I had 32 kg of free baggage instead of 23 kg since I was from Brazil. Very comfortable on A380 and 77W. Although the Beyond entertainment system was not as extensive as Emirates or Cathay Pacific it was enough to keep me entertained. The system was also in many languages and user-friendly. 744 was not as good but still clean and well maintained. All flights arrive early. Meals got better compared to previous flights with them and menu was provided on GRU-LAX only. Choices of snacks also increased. Korean Air should be among the best of the four stars airlines or even deserves an upgrade to five stars when the English standard of cabin crews is improved.

ICN-HKG HKG-ICN. Probably one of the best airlines I have been on! Cabin crew were polite friendly and welcoming. Food was very traditional Korean which was nice.

Travelled as a family of 2 adults and 3 children (age 12 12 and 13) from Auckland to LHR return via ICN. Very easy check-in and transfers at all airports. Good seat pitch for economy. Very smiling and attentive crew on all legs to and from Auckland to London. Great transfer layoff at ICN between AKL-LHR at hotel arranged as part of the ticket price. Food OK but not the best economy food I've had. Entertainment again OK with enough for adults to be entertained but would recommend taking additional entertainment if travelling with 7-13 year olds. Planes were very clean. Overall this was a very good experience and certainly an airline and route we would use again to travel from New Zealand to the UK.

4 flights with them in June round trip from HKG-JFK on A380 and HKG-LAX-GRU on A380 and 77W. May not have the best inflight entertainment the best meals in the industry or the best amenity kit for economy class yet the friendliness of the crews and the seat pitch stand out. Crews are cheerful attentive and charming. Their service level is consistent. Important to point out that they keep the cabin clean and are very organized when handling special meals or assistance to elderly or children. I deduct one mark for inflight meal as the portion was too small. There are snacks between meals (do not receive any on LAX-GRU though). I hope Korean Air can improve its meal quality and distribute menu in the flights.

2 July 2013 Washington Dulles to for Seoul Incheon KE094. 11 July 2013 Seoul Incheon for Washington Dulles KE093. Each seat had no air conditioning control. The temp was around 85 degrees which is unacceptable. The air was turned on about 3 times each way of the 14 hour flight. Rows are announced by staff to start boarding but everyone lines up. Tickets checked and they allow everyone to board regardless of seat number. Creates a delay in boarding. Boarding process is chaos and very unorganized at Dulles Airport and Incheon. I bought water after passing through TSA we found a second security check and they took my water just 10 feet before the cabin door.

I flew KE631/632 from ICN-CEB/CEB-ICN in May. IFE was nice and the seat has 35 inch pitch and was very comfortable. I ordered a special meal (Seafood) and was salmon baked vegetables and pasta which was great. Only disappointment was that I couldn't see the crew during the flight. I was thirsty but there were no crew they were focusing on selling duty free items. All crews were kind and their English was good.

After a 4 hour flight from Manila to Inchon and a 6 hour layover I boarded the plane to see my window seat taken by a family with children. They pointed to the child and not wanting to be inconsiderate I took their middle seat in another aisle. I told the hostess I wished a window seat. She said she would get back to me after boarding. Even after I was served a special dietary meal and explained this isn't my seat and I was still waiting for a window I was never moved or given an explanation. Last time I use this airline.

Flew BNE-ICN-LHR return in Economy class. Overall I was very impressed with this airline. Aircraft were modern comfortable and clean on all sectors. Cabin service was wonderful regular drink runs and food was tasty. Normally 3 dinner options which is a plus. Meals served with stainless steel cutlery and hot towels distributed before dinner which is fantastic. IFE had a wide selection and ICN is the best airport for transit. All flights on time and bags available promptly. I fly regularly and Korean Air is among the best in Economy class.

Incheon to Paris on 27 May 2013. Very old 744 with small seats and poor legroom. I thought KE had moved these ex Chinese Airlines aircraft's on. Cabin crew spoke little English and no French and went about their duties like robots. Will avoid if this is the best they can offer.

KE2708 747-400 Haneda to Gimpo. Business Class. A 2 hour flight where the standard of service for business class was very poor. The forward cabin has comfortable pod seats that offer comfort and I understand lie flat capabilities are organised in a 2-3-2 configuration. The cabin was not full and on boarding the greeting was friendly. A soft drink was offered pre-take off but then it was not until 40 minutes into the flight that any service was offered. Hot towels came and then the trolley served lunch. No pre-dinner drinks no alcohol of any sort on the trolley and when I asked for a wine I was told only red wine was available one type in 375 ml bottles. Drinkable but not memorable. Replenishment was on demand. Compared to subsequent regional flights of less time on MH and SQ (the latter outstanding) Korean Air business class falls well below an acceptable standard. I would not risk a long flight with them in case it was the same. A 3 hour flight a few days later was little better.

### Korean Air customer review
ICN-HKG KE613 A330-300 Business class. Having experienced a very poor flight with Korean a few days earlier I hoped that the longer sector would enable KE to lift their business class service. It was better in this 3 hour flight but well below other regional airlines charging similar fares. The 330 was relatively new and the pod seats set in a 2-2-2 configuration. The seats seem the same as the 747-400 and appear quite acceptable. Pre takeoff soft drinks only followed more quickly this time by hot towels after takeoff. The crew again were polite and courteous in greeting and approaching you as a valued passenger. When asked for our pre-lunch drinks and eating choices the Champagne listed on the wine list was "not carried on this flight". Hardly a "normal" business class. Wines were served from a bottle this time and there was a choice of white and red and spirits if required. Inflight entertainment was broad and acceptable. However this flight proved to my satisfaction after my earlier shorted flight that KE is at best a 3 star airline in its business class and that unless its fares are lower I would chose a different carrier. 2 years ago on an Asiana flight from Shanghai to Taipei the latter's standard were far superior.

BNE-ICN-LGW then PRG-ICN-BNE return. I didn't actually get to fly the LGW leg as the flight was cancelled and Korean put me on Qantas to LHR via SIN (which was a much more expensive fare) at no cost to me. Return flight PRG-ICH was in a B747 no problems whatsoever. Then nearly 36 hours layover at the Park Hyatt Incheon (fantastic) and the the ICH-BNE leg was on a new plane. Extra pitch on both planes was really appreciated and cabin crew could not do enough to look after passengers. Entertainment was great. Am returning to London in June and am flying Korean again.

### Korean Air customer review
Customer Service is a 0. Two weeks ahead of a long planned trip they made a schedule change that only gave us 45 minutes in Seoul to make our connection to Bali. This not being allowed by them they wanted to put us on a much later flight that would have caused us to miss a day in Bali. After 3 days (9 hours documented) with the agent and Korean Air they basically would not move our tickets up because they would have to upgrade a 50 minute flight segment to first class because there was only one economy seat left. They take the requirement literally that all they have to do is put you on the next available flight with no consideration for your needs. We had to take a refund pay $700 more and we are not even sure we are on the same flight because they advertised two flights at almost the same time on the same plane. Having traveled I have never been treated so poorly.

BKK-ICN vv on refreshing and kept-clean 777 cabins. Seats are fairly comfortable however a bit rugged for medium haul flights. Crews seemed courteous and attentive but needed for requests thrice for a cup of water missing from catering (and twice and the other leg). Crew English proficiency needs improvement. Food was fine. Incheon outbound departed 40 min late in accusation of a missing passenger and congested traffic. To sum up hard products are fine and consistent service improvement is needed however.

### Korean Air customer review
I feel Korean Air is lagging behind other airlines in east Asia. Although their service was fair it was not what I expected in Business Class. The aircraft from Taipei to Seoul was modern and comfortable. The staff were very gracious and polite. However from Seoul to Toronto the aircraft was tired and worn and the cabin itself was not terribly clean. The toilets were kept spotless but Business class wasn't terribly full. The seats were not lay flat seats and the seats seemed a little worn. Somewhere over the Pacific my entertainment system failed and although they staff very graciously offered me a change of seat the move was one to the aft cabin which I chose not to do. Overall if I were to compare Korean to China Airlines or EVA or even JAL and PAL for the money I may choose one of the latter airlines. Although the service and food on KAL is outstanding for a premium product from Seoul to Toronto without flat bed seats seems a little counter-intuitive to me.

AKL-ICH-LHR. Older 777's on AKL-ICN not as comfortable as newer 777's on the London leg which has lie flat seats. The upgrade on IFE was good until my wife's set stopped working after about 8 hours. IFE on the new plane was good and easy to use. The stopover at Hyatt Regency ICN airport was excellent and does help with jet lag. Cabin crew good but and most have a very good command of English. Food is limited in choice but is good and plentiful. We travel with assistance and where Korean supply the service it is remarkably good. Only at Heathrow the service is generally poor.

I flew to London in March with my 3 year old daughter. I could not fault them from the minute I checked in the staff were courteous and couldn't do enough to help. Staff came up to me at each boarding gate to and ask if I would like to board first with my daughter. Having the stop over at the Hyatt Regency is Korea was brilliant made a huge difference to our long trip. It was all very organised. Staff on board were helpful and polite. I thought the food was great and drinks were offered frequently. My daughter was given a child's meal including some little treats along with a bag of goodies. Overall I was pleased with the value for money.

JFK-ICN-JFK. Flew round-trip on the A380. The entire experience was first class starting with the quick and efficient check-in. The Korean Air lounge was nice but not extravagant on either end but the Prestige Class seat on the A380 and the overall flight experience were both excellent. Service on-board - friendly timely and professional. And the food was excellent. Have flown other airlines' A380s in business and did not have nearly as good as an experience.

### Korean Air customer review
London to Auckland return I cannot fault this airline. All flights on time excellent service comfortable seats amenity kits hot towels and a night in the Hyatt with dinner and breakfast I am looking forward to my next flight with them. The Seoul to Auckland flight was only half full so I had a row to myself.

### Korean Air customer review
Just returned to London Heathrow from Fiji after connections in Seoul and must say we were all very impressed with the excellent Flights Service and Flight crew. Would definitely fly with Korean Airlines again. The layover hotel at Seoul of the Hyatt Regency was fabulous.

Las Vegas to Incheon. Service was very good. When I pressed the call button CA was appeared in 1 min. Very quick response. Food was great. I like the Korean breakfast that was porridge. Not only cabin crew but also ground staff were so helpful and friendly. Always smiled to every passenger.

### Korean Air customer review
Paris CDG to Seoul and back. First flight onboard B777-300. Ground services managed by grumpy Air France staff but operated from terminal 2E which is the most modern of CDG airport. Economy cabin is a 3-3-3 layout. Legroom was above average and the screen wide. The inflight entertainment system was very complete with movies in French. Nice amenities such as slippers toothbrush and water bottles were provided. Two well presented meals (real cutlery no plastic) were served with both choice of Korean and western food. Wines served from the bottle and hot towel before meal. I would recommend traditional Korean Bibimbap. Snacks available during the flight in the galley and flights attendants made lot of drinks runs during the night. One the main asset of Korean Air is the excellent service and the consistency of its cabin crew very elegant and professional. Return flight onboard Airbus A380 with one of the largest legroom in the industry in economy and a nice duty free shop at the rear of the aircraft available for all passengers. Would definitely recommend. Very good value for money and flexible fares with no restrictions for 820 euros return.

### Korean Air customer review
LAX-ICN-LAX in B773 Prestige Class 'full flat' seat (doesn't quite feel that way though). The 2-3-2 layout shared with AF is inferior to DL's new direct access aisle config Delta is really running away from its partners in Skyteam. Flights on time in-air and lounge product fine. KE's web presence however unmitigated disaster: featureless and antiquated. Even after jumping through the needlessly many hoops to become a Skypass member web check in only produced errors. Losing 2 hours from a busy schedule each way because of forced early arrival at check-in counter stings more than an uninspired meal service or an unsmiling crew. KE take note!

### Korean Air customer review
Travelled Brisbane Australia to Incheon overnight at Hyatt Incheon to Chicago Los Angeles to Incheon Incheon to Brisbane Australia. Must comment on excellent service and quality of Prestige Class - great comfort and friendly crew made the flights relaxing. As I travel frequently on many different airlines others could learn a lesson or 2 from them.

### Korean Air customer review
Flight was UK to Seoul to Brisbane. First long haul flight and was very impressed with the service. The entertainment was good and staff were courteous. The food was mainly Korean pretty good overall some usual dishes such as green cake which tasted ok. Would definitely fly with them again!

### Korean Air customer review
GMP-HND return on b747 during Korean New Year holiday so flights were full. The service was polite and attentive. They offer IFE but you barely have enough time to watch a movie from takeoff to landing! They served a hot meal in each direction which wasn't bad. Both GMP and HND airports are convenient.

### Korean Air customer review
Codeshare flight with AF in to LHR. KE operated from ICN to CDG. The flight was very full. I was in 52H on a B744. Although the leg room was fairly generous the AVOD box took up some of that space under the seat in front of me. No power outlets for laptops or other devices. The AVOD itself was better than other far eastern carriers and kept me entertained for the day flight back to Europe. Food and drinks were plentiful and the refreshments schedule was helpfully shown in the inflight magazine. All crew were attentive and spoke English. Amenity kit including slippers provided in economy.

### Korean Air customer review
ICN-JFK round-trip. JFK bound in B777-300 and ICN bound in A380. Both planes were spotless and seats were very comfortable with generous space. A380 had even wider seat with more recline. Duty free shop at the aft of A380 cabin was a waste of space though. Service was prompt and FA's were polite. KE did not offer periodic drink runs like Asiana but call button took care of any additional requests. The biggest letdown was the food quality. Food is served in thin plastic tray and looked like they were steamed. Steamed" steak or French fries cannot be tasty. All meals were very poor. Both flights have great IFE system but not much to watch. Aerial view from the tail wing was the most interesting thing to watch. Overall very comfortable flight thanks to the coolest planes in the market but there were some areas to be watched.

### Korean Air customer review
Flew CDG-ICN-CEB and CEB-ICN-PRG in economy. A380 was fabulous with excellent seat pitch (34) duty free shop at the rear and wide comfortable cabin. Others a/cs like B747-400 and 777-200 older but well maintained however on route ICN-PRG they used older 777 with old economy seats and smaller legroom. Crew attentive ready to help or to serve additional drinks or snacks. Food very good and bibimbap (Korean dish) very tasty. During the night noodles also available in the galleys. For one leg I ordered special "seafood" meal which again was perfect and consists fish shrimps and even scallops. In general - perfect legroom (in A/C with new economy seats) nice crew and perfect meals.

### Korean Air customer review
PVG-ICN-SIN return on three A333s and one upgraded B744. A333s were exceptionally good. The seats and AVOD the best we've been on. The cabin crew were smiley and helpful. ICN is an exceptional airport and the ground staff were friendly and helpful. ICN-PVG Korean Air changed the expected A333 for an older B747 and you could feel the difference. The seat was narrower but slightly more legroom and the AVOD was smaller and slower. Unusually the seat I was in 53A was where the seating changes to 2x4x2 from 3x4x3 and it meant the window was almost a chair away: I could walk between my seat and the window! Not a good choice if you want to see the ground.

### Korean Air customer review
Last week flew from LHR to Siem Reap via ICN. B777-300 on the first leg to ICN aircraft just over one year old so in very good order. The flight crew were visible in the cabin for the whole flight. Cabin crew smiled and were very helpful and that was in economy! Had two seats right at the back of the aircraft one four sets of two on the whole plane. Leg room and recline was good but what is it with the latest seat cushions? My backside was sore and numb after both flights because they were so hard. Flight arrived early into ICN. Flight from ICN to REP was on a B737 900 longest flight I have done on a 737 just over 5 hours! This stretched 737 is cramped for international medium/long haul work in my opinion. Seats were hard again and leg room limited. Service was however very good and flight arrived early. No problems with luggage either. I would definitely use KAL again and I'm actually looking forward to the return flights. I'll get myself a nice gel or memory foam cushion next time though!

### Korean Air customer review
Toronto - Incheon - Denpassar return. Food good - actually had taste but not a lot of variation. Lots of fish. Decent selection of movies. Very attentive service. Clean cabins clean and comfortable seats. Would absolutely fly again. Note was upgraded to business class for one leg and would rate that 5 stars all the way.

### Korean Air customer review
Brisbane to Incheon and then on to JFK then return home the same way. Economy the whole way. Outbound was on A330 and 777 and while service was good agree with others comments that they need to expand entertainment choices. Return home was on A380 an improved feeling of comfort.

### Korean Air customer review
REP-ICN-NYC return on B738 and A380. A great experience. Seats very comfortable for my 185cm frame food excellent and AVOD had plenty of choice for the trans-atlantic. Only negative was the lack of restrooms on the A380 (2 in each Economy section) making for long lines after meals.

### Korean Air customer review
Bangkok - Incheon midday flight business class on 737-800. On this aircraft they use their oldest available business class seats hardly any recline and most uncomfortable. Headset is same as economy no noise cancellation as you get on Thai for example. Will avoid flying Korean at least in business class in the future.

GMP-CJU. Aircraft used was a 737-900. Although it was a domestic flight announcements were made in Korean English and Japanese. Flight attendants also knew some English. Since it was only a 1 hour flight only drinks were served. Flight attendants and Korean Air ground crew were courteous and polite. Will definitely fly with them again.

### Korean Air customer review
Sydney to London via Seoul in July 2012. It was the cheapest airline as we were travelling during the London Olympics. The stopover at the Hyatt on the way through was excellent. Travelled with an unsettled 10 month old so didn't even get chance to try out the inflight entertainment but meals were good (choose Korean) and snacks available in between meals. Alcohol limited but expected that. Staff were very polite.

### Korean Air customer review
B747-400 (ATL-ICN) and B777-200ER (ICN-KUL). Requested special meal excellent IFE. Less legroom with B747 (what can you expect for economy class) but great cabin on B777. Overall it was good.

### Korean Air customer review
I never actually flew with them because the cyclone that hit their main airport led to unavoidable delays which meant I had to use another airline. I am reviewing them however because I believe the way a company deals with problems is a good indicator of the company. The people I dealt with were friendly compassionate and helpful under tough circumstances and the company seamed to be structured to handle issues in a prompt way and with perfect English.

### Korean Air customer review
KE 082 from JFK to Seoul was an Airbus A380 on December 6 inflight entertainment is limited. The food portions were small for Economy class. KE 653 from Seoul to Bangkok is on 777-300 again movie selection limited. Hope they can improve their inflight service and add more movie channels to their inflight entertainment system.

### Korean Air customer review
Flew NRT-ICN-NRT in economy class. Korean Air was fine. I'm gold with Delta so had access to their lounges in both NRT and ICN and priority immigration in NRT (but not Incheon). They were on time offered a reasonably comfortable seat with enough leg room even for a 6' 2" person like myself had touch IFE with enough options for a short flight and a USB outlet for charging devices. FA were polite and attentive and a hot meal was served on both legs. The food was OK but nothing fancy.

### Korean Air customer review
We flew from London to Auckland business class and I was extremely impressed. The first leg to Seoul as in a 777 and we had flat beds that were excellent. On the second leg to Auckland we were in an older 747 and only had seats that went flat but at an angle and were much less comfortable. The food was excellent and the service from the FA's was good. A really pleasant surprise.

### Korean Air customer review
MEL-ICN-LHR return with family of 5. All of us are over 6 foot. Leg room was excellent entertainment great. The staff were always willing to help. The food was a choice of Asian and western - typical airline food but the kids didn't complain. Had a stopover in ICN whilst our bags were sent straight on to Heathrow which was great. Overall I would definitely fly with this airline again.

### Korean Air customer review
Good service on KE644 and KE643 from Singapore to Incheon airport return and domestic flight from Gimpo to Jeju airport. Service great even asked for an extra drink on flight back landing smooth. Leg room from Singapore to Incheon and to Singapore is great but the domestic flight is very cramped. Seat is very comfortable no leg rest though on this 777-200 and 737-900.

Jakarta to Incheon. Seats in economy class as well as crew cabin service are quite satisfactory. I continued my flight from Gimpo to Jeju on this flight there was no entertainment at all and we were not given food or snacks - only drinks given.

### Korean Air customer review
DFW-ICN-BKK and BKK-ICN-ATL. You get an amenity pack in economy class. Food was above average AVOD was good and flight attendants are excellent as they serve food clean toilets and meet every need without a hair out of place. Flights were on time and changing planes at ICN is a breeze. Boarding was a bit chaotic for all flights as everyone rushed the gate as soon as first class was called. Enforced boarding by zone might help here. Otherwise there is nothing bad to say about this airline.

### Korean Air customer review
ATL-ICN-ATL. Korean air always meets my expectation. This was my first round trip from ATL to ICN which is the longest route of the airline. Great service throughout the flight. Return flight delayed 30 minutes by fog in ICN however ground crews in ATL took care of the connecting flight really well.

### Korean Air customer review
Return Chicago-Incheon-Manila on 777-300ER and 777-200. I was very satisfied with the flight experience. The planes were clean FA's courteous and helpful AVOD IFE was excellent (screen as big as an iPad) and there was plenty of legroom (34" pitch). The only negative things- the seat cushions were somewhat hard and became uncomfortable on a 12+hour flights the cabin temp was on the warm side and the food was good but not as good as on Asiana. Airlines should put menus on the IFE so people can easily view them.

### Korean Air customer review
LGW-ICN-MEL. I booked my ticket a week before I departed and it was a bargain price. I chose it as the reviews on here seemed to rate it highly and I was not disappointed. Check in at Gatwick was swift with no problems. First leg was a 777-200 which had good amount of leg room although the seats were a little hard. Second leg was on an A330-200 which had pretty bad leg room. New style seats but I still found them hard. I had to swap to an exit seat as it's no good for people over 6'4". Staff were the most helpful and polite I have come across and I've flown on a lot of top end airlines. Good food and entertainment lots of drinks too. Can't fault it for the price! I would definitely fly them again.

A380 LAX-ICN. Fantastic aircraft roomy and very comfortable. Seats were great excellent attendants and service ICN-Beijing B777 aircraft showed its age but once again service was great Shanghai-ICN A330; ICN-LAX B744 both spacious comfortable and excellent service.

Brisbane-Seoul-New York-Seoul-Brisbane. Very satisfied with all flights especially A380 NY-Seoul. Found the lie flat seats ok and managed to get some sleep on all legs. Cabin staff were very nice. Food nothing special but satisfactory. Wouldn't hesitate to fly with Korean again.

### Korean Air customer review
Toronto-Seoul-Toronto. Service amazing but business class seats are not comfortable. Another issue is you have no space where to put IPad computer cleaning utilities book like you do at Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines. Korean Airlines Lounge was packed. I had to pay to go into the prestige lounge. I think passengers with a business class ticket should have priority or they should have more than one lounge like Cathay Japan and Singapore Airlines. I will avoid to flight through Seoul in the future.

### Korean Air customer review
London - Seoul on 777. Check in very friendly staff at the counter. Skyteam lounge in T4 is convenient and airy but the showers were not available as there was no one manning it. On board very courteous cabin crew. They should really change their menu as the food seems to be always the same - Korean bibimbap or beef. The seat turns into a flat bed but it is quite narrow lacks privacy from your neighbor as well as having very little storage space. Lounge in Seoul was big shower facilities were basic and feels like a cheap hotel. Seoul - Osaka short flight with good meal seats the same as long haul flights. Again very courteous cabin crew. One thing about Korean Air is that duty free seems to be a big deal for them they kept on walking around with the catalogue or pushing the trolley around!

### Korean Air customer review
I flew in from Mongolia so cannot comment on Seoul Incheon check-in etc but airside is one huge shopping mall. I found signage to be poor but the Korean Air Business Lounge was large comfy and had a good selection of drinks and nibbles. Seoul to London - the cabin (B747 Upper deck) is just about to become tatty. It needs some attention was comfy but not startling. This was the older clam shell seats and not fully reclining which was a real shame. Food and service was excellent. Nothing exceptional nothing terribly wrong. There are better options but this was absolutely okay.

### Korean Air customer review
Prestige class from Seoul-New York return. They had some of the worst business class seats I have ever sat in. The airline calls the seats "lie-flat" and should not be allowed to. When fully reclined into a bed the seats pitch downward at a noticeable angle causing you to slide right down them. I got no sleep on a long haul flight because of them. Will never fly this airline again for business class.

### Korean Air customer review
Flew Melbourne-Seoul-Vancouver-San Francisco-Seoul-Melbourne. Aircraft clean and comfortable toilets clean. Flew Prestige Class and the service was friendly efficient and food lovely. Purser welcomed you aboard and thanked you for flying at arrival to destination. Overnight in Seoul on return journey due to 24 hour layover at the Hyatt Regency. Have now flown them twice on long haul trips and would not hesitate to fly them again fares very competitive and no problems with check-in at any of the airports flights meals luggage seats etc. Fresh baked cookies for snacks. If I had any quibble it would be with their minute wine glasses. No problems getting them refilled but would appreciate a larger glass to start with and it wouldn't be quite so embarrassing having to ask for said refill.

### Korean Air customer review
SGN to IAD return. All flights were on time and well attended. Airbus 330 to and from ICN and 777 300 to IAD and return. Both flight were clean comfortable and staffed by friendly flight attendants. Check-in was easy and Incheon remains a very pleasant airport. About IAD the less said the better.

### Korean Air customer review
HKG-ICN-GUM. Quite possibly the best airline I have ever flown with. On both legs I was impressed aircraft's were modern and clean (A330 and B777) more than the average number of FA's. FA's were professional friendly and helpful inflight entertainment available as soon as you sit down FA's speak excellent English much more leg room for an economy seat than you would get with another airline in flight entertainment available behind each seat with many many options. Wasn't crazy about the food but did like the Haagen Daz ice cream for dessert. Don't ever really expect much of airline food anyway though. One of the few airlines I would go out of my way to fly with again.

### Korean Air customer review
KE036 Atlanta to Incheon Terminal F at Hartsfield Jackson. Boeing 777-300ER. My entire flight was a codeshare beginning from Orlando international to ATL via DL airlines then to Incheon via KE. When I arrived at ATL and took the train to terminal F there was a fairly long line at the KAL gate which made me prioritize lunch over checking in. After lunch I came back to hear the gate agent tell me the airplane was full and they had to bump me to business class "prestige class. KE035 ICN to ATL arrived 30 minutes late. Not only that but some of the other elite passengers were grumbling when the boarding process didn't move as fluidly as they would have hoped. However once everyone was seated in the aircraft everything went flawlessly. The cabin crew smiled. This airplane was well kept the toilets were clean and nothing seemed to be broken. The food selection was nice. I drained my ANR headset batteries halfway through the flight and had to swap with new ones. I had an extra pair with me in the overhead so I tried to swap them only to lose one battery on the cabin floor. I asked a cabin crew member to help me look for it she came back with an LED light got down on her knee and found it for me. That is going beyond the call of duty in my book. After landing at Incheon I deboarded and got to the parking lot within 20 minutes with my checked baggage.

### Korean Air customer review
First time flying with them and was impressed. The seats were comfortable with lots of leg room. The touch screen was great with about 50 movies to pick from including lots that are only just out at the cinema in the UK. Food was really good but would have liked more. Service was brilliant the cabin crew smiled the whole time.

LHR-ICN-AUC. Not new but well maintained 747 - 400. Everything from boarding to disembarking in AUC was polite and friendly. Plane was clean seats comfortable even for a nap. Selection of food excellent. Rarely rely on IFE but managed to listen some good music for 2 hours and spent about the same time staring at screen. Great time during layover in ICN with fair prices in countless shops. This was my first time with Korean after many flights with more glorious competitors.

### Korean Air customer review
MEL-ICN-LGW and CDG-ICN-MEL. 777-300ER and A330s were clean comfortable and well presented. Very diverse inflight entertainment with the biggest screens in economy I have ever seen. The seats recline more than any other airline I have traveled internationally on - not only does the back support tilt but the seat bottom also pitches out to give a much flatter and more comfortable resting position. Incredibly polite and helpful staff. Food was top-notch. Incheon is an excellent airport. Never delayed. Will definitely fly them again.

### Korean Air customer review
ATL-ICN. My trip back to Korea offered the same meals entertainment and professional hospitality expected on Korean Air. The only difference and an important one at that was something everyone should note. I had a window seat (left side of the plane) and it was so hot from the sun that the window was hot to the touch for about 5-6 hours. Sleeping was difficult and made the area noticeably warmer. Obviously not Korean Air's fault but still important to note.

### Korean Air customer review
Round-trip Flight from Atlanta to PVG in June. Seats were full recline and comfortable on 777-200. Flight attendants attentive and no problems with speaking or understanding English. I plan to fly Korean on future trips to Shanghai via ICN and would recommend without reservations.

### Korean Air customer review
INC to KUL on 777-200 business class; 6 hour flight. Overall a pleasant experience. First time ever with Korean Air; an unintentional booking as it was a codeshare with Malaysia airlines. Well groomed FA's. Business class cabin has 2-2-2 configuration face front seating spacious! IFE located in clumsy console in front and between seats overly complex to navigate IFE as there are too many language options. Very confusing and frustrating. Bi bim bap for dinner a must have. Only downside is the weaker English speaking skills of the FA's. A great business class experience.

### Korean Air customer review
Paris - Auckland cannot fault performance of the cabin crew seats are comfortable. They supplied us with toothbrush paste padded eye mask and wipes and good entertainment. I also commend Incheon Airport's Tourist Transfer Hotel. We had a 10 hour layover in Seoul which was a bit daunting until we discovered the hotel. It cost us approximately 60 euros for 6 hours and we would have paid double that just to rest.

### Korean Air customer review
ICN-KIX-ICN: two short flights. First leg on a A333 and the second was on a B772. Both of the times the cabin crew responded politely to all calls made and smiled. The seat was alright. However the food was terrible. Only one choice was given both ways. To KIX was some kind of eel with rice. It just looked so bad. From KIX was a sandwich and was worse than ones that stores in Korea sell for $.99. My AVOD had to be reset but no problem the crew did it within five minutes and apologized when they did not have to. Both flights arrived early.

### Korean Air customer review
ICN-LAX - Arrived at ICN airport to find out that my flight KE017 A380 flight will be delayed 2 hours which meant I would miss a connecting flight from LAX to Chicago. Even though I booked this flight separately the check-in agent spoke to her manager and re-booked a later connecting flight free of charge. Lounge at ICN is ok I was expecting more given it's home base. Boarding was quick and efficient and I was very impressed with the business class layout having flown Singapore airlines A380 on numerous occasions it was great to see an alternate layout. Plenty of leg room and very comfy seat. TV screen is large however the movie and TV selection isn't as extensive as Singapore or Qatar and the headsets the same as economy. The most impressive part of the A380 is the on-board bars at the front and back of the plane - excellent cocktails served with snacks. Dinner was served after take off and the food was excellent and steak cooked to your preference - I ordered medium and it was cooked to perfection! Overall a great experience and extremely friendly and efficient cabin crew.

### Korean Air customer review
ICN-ATL on 777-300ER. Seats were comfortable for 14 hours ample leg room and recline. The seatback entertainment was better than on the old 747 because of bigger screen. My only complaint is that it's the same in both directions so my options will be low on the return trip to ICN but that's a small problem to have. The mood lighting in Economy was a nice touch! The service and staff - pleasant and graceful even during severe turbulence. I opted for the Korean meals and they were delicious. Airport check-in was a breeze using the self service kiosk. Despite what appeared to be a large bag drop line I was in and out of the drop line and x-ray procedure in less than 10 minutes.

LAX to Narita (with 2 hour layover) and then to Incheon. Economy seats had a pillow blanket headphones slippers toothbrush and toothpaste. I had the window seat. The seat itself was pretty roomy able to stretch my feet below the seat in from of me. The food was great for a plane meal. There were about three options for each meal. They serve tea and coffee after each meal. Entertainment was great! Overall I was very satisfied with the service. They spoke good English and Japanese! They were very polite from start to end. Never failed to smile!

### Korean Air customer review
LAX to GRU in business. Service on the ground the best I have encountered. Left my cell in the cab and the ticket agent worked with me to get my phone back. Lounge was decent in LAX but TBIT is awful. Very comfortable seat with enough leg room for me at 6'3. Food service was very weak and I had to constantly ask for extra water as the FAs were nowhere to be found. Was hungry after both meals which was odd but they were very bready and lacked substance. Slept for most of the flight. Overall an outstanding flight with great ground service and decent in flight service.

### Korean Air customer review
Flew my family of 4 from Hong Kong to Brazil service was great all flights on time only bad experience was on our way back in LAX. I was taking a later flight to HKG while my family went to Brazil they would not allow me to check in early so I could assist my family through security with their earlier flight. With a 7 and a 1 year old this was difficult for my wife. I was holding a business class ticket back but they still would not let me check in early. I found seats in business class uncomfortable and the seat pad was short. I'm 6'2" about 220 but while in the upright position it was uncomfortable. Good experience but the upgrade for 2k was not worth it.

### Korean Air customer review
SYD-ICN-IAD return. Unfortunately if you travel from Australia to US via Korea - with a very long layover overnight - you don't qualify for hotel vouchers. Is not noted in promotional material (with different European policy apparently) and they weren't friendly even though I was travelling alone with 2 children. Could have been a lot more helpful.

### Korean Air customer review
SYD-ICN-LHR return. First time with Korean Air and found the whole experience very satisfying. Lots of leg room for my husband who is very tall and interactive screens with plenty of choices. Staff were friendly and helpful amenities were spotless and the food delicious. Vouchers for free accommodation and meals on the layover (on way across) was excellent. Would highly recommend this airline and would fly with them again.

### Korean Air customer review
Just completed SYD-LGW return. Full flights to Gatwick were fantastic with about a 90 minute stopover at Incheon and avoiding Heathrow was a bonus. Return flights were the same except there were quite a few spare seats. We spent a night in Seoul and the KAL limousine service from/to the airport was effortless. Incheon airport is the best airport anywhere for every need travellers require. Friendly happy crews meals/snacks throughout spotless toilets quiet relaxed passengers. The four 10-11 hour flights passed very quickly and either departed or arrived early and on time. The B777 were comfortable and clean with plenty of leg room and with an actual feeling of roominess. This has to be the best economy cabin/seating we have experienced. Could not fault any aspect of the trip and is most highly recommended.

### Korean Air customer review
Have flown with countless different airlines all over the world and Korean Air rank up there as the best I've ever flown with. Have flown International with them from Japan and internally within Korea. Staff are wonderful - spoke prefect English to me even on the internal flights which I didn't expect. Best vegetarian meal I've had on a plane and wonderful airport ground staff when I got lost in Busan. Would fly with them every time I fly if I could.

Recently completed an AKL-LON return with Korean Air my first experience of the airline. It won't be my last. I have done this trip over three dozen times and Korean has to be up there with the best. Four (almost) 12 hr sectors and all four crews were exceptional. Attentive professional courteous and smiling. Attendants in abundance what a pleasant surprise. Aircraft B777 were spotless seat pitch (34 in) as good as you get in economy and especially the newer 300ER with 10in (I think) screens and no cumbersome floor IE unit in the way. The loos were cleaned! Western food was a bit average but really so what. Everything else was superb. Check in was easy in both Auckland and Heathrow. Korean Air you were great.

BKK-INC-Tel Aviv in Prestige class. A330-300 BKK-INC Upgrade to first class cabin through online check-in. INC-Tel Aviv 777-200 lie flat seats which are basically the old lie flat first class Kosmo sleeper - perfect for travel on any long hall flight. FA's were great cabins were clean and food was ok. I have already booked another round trip on the same route for next month - excellent value for money.

JFK-ICN-BNE. JFK-ICN Business Class on an almost new A380. Business class takes up the entire upper deck. The seat is a shell type with a full flat bed and excellent seat pitch (around 74'). IFE is good with a reasonable selection of movies music and the sky show. Food and wines offered on this flight were of good quality. Flight attendants were excellent and very attentive and toilets were kept immaculately clean at all times. ICN-BNE on an A330-300 aircraft clean and well presented seats were shell type with slightly angled lie flat beds. FA's were excellent as they had been on my previous 3 flights. I did not eat dinner on this flight I flattened my bed out and managed to sleep until breakfast about 1 hour before we landed in Brisbane. Breakfast (a quiche) was not particularly appetising and I left most of it.

BNE-ICN-JFK. BNE-ICN was 8am on A330-300 in Business Class (Prestige) aircraft was clean and well presented seats are shell type angled lie flats comfortable for both sitting and laying down. IFE was ok but not a huge choice of movies headphones supplied are not noise cancelling and of poor quality. Food served was quite good but the wines fairly average. Flight attendants were excellent and kept up a ready supply of water or other drinks. ICN-JFK on a Boeing 777-300ER which was very new seats are full flat beds with excellent seat pitch. IFE was as per the BNE-ICN flight and food and drinks were good. After dinner was served lights were dimmed shades closed and everyone relaxed. Service was excellent I travel with a CPAP machine and having a spare seat next to me is a great benefit. I have travelled with Korean a number of times and I think the service and the quality of the aircraft has improved substantially over that time.

### Korean Air customer review
LAX-ICN-KUL in Business "Prestige" Class. Excellent service on all fronts. Lounge area on the A380 is a very pleasant place to relax during the longer flight. Seats are very comfortable although a higher quality headset blanket and pillow would truly round out the product on offer.

### Korean Air customer review
HKG-ICN on new A380 business class. Check-in was great the staff helpful. Immigration staff were extremely rude lounge was alright. Not much food or drinks served but comfortable chairs. The cabin crew welcomed me with a drink and the pilot came around welcoming each passenger by their surname. Food was good! Good AVOD and comfortable seats. I strongly recommend KE for both domestic and international flights.

### Korean Air customer review
AKL-INC-LHR return. The 2nd time we have flown prestige class with Korean and in 2 years they have lifted their game considerably. All legs were the new pod style seat which have much better recline not lie flat but we knew this and they are ok comfort wise if you ask for extra pillow to pad the seat on long flights. AVOD on all legs now which makes stopping for a meal etc easy. As another reviewer has said it is a pity that the entertainment offered is the same on all legs alternating movies on different legs would give you a lot more choice. Flight attendants were great introduced themselves and us by name were quick professional and friendly. Food was fine no western food but good to try something different. Amenity kits were handed out on each leg as well as mouthwash in the toilet razors etc. Toilets were clean throughout. Lie flat seats are the only thing that would make a huge difference on long haul but what they are now offering has greatly improved since 2009.

### Korean Air customer review
We have travelled on in excess of 10 different international airlines in the last 12-15 years and rate Korean Air amongst the top. The cabin crew were friendly and polite and were always on hand with fruit juice coffee or water during the two 12 hour flights to London (and on our return also). The toilets were always clean and fresh and the meals tasty and well presented. We especially appreciated the seat pitch which gave us a lot more leg room than on some other airlines.

### Korean Air customer review
HNL-BKK business class. Seats were comfortable on B777-200 from HNL-CN. Staff very attentive. Blanket is thick and warm. Food was superb even for a vegetarian. Two 4 course meals with snacks in between. Bathrooms cleaned every 30 mins. I sat in 7a which has extra leg room and is very quiet. ICN-BKK on B777-300. Seats were a bit more comfortable than the 200. Inflight amenities kit offered on first leg but not on second. Looking forward to my return to Hawaii.

MEL-SEL-CTS then NRT-SEL-MEL. Cannot fault this airline great entertainment lots of movies and games. Comfy seats very attentive staff food was very good for economy. Got put up in the Grand Hyatt overnight in Seoul with a free buffet breakfast and dinner. All round great experience highly recommended!

### Korean Air customer review
MNL-ICN. B777 - very clean aircraft with well groomed and efficient flight attendants. I had no expectations before flying with them but I was pleasantly surprised. IFE selection is excellent food onboard is satisfactory. ICN-MNL. Service wasn't as good some flight attendants' grooming was mediocre. They ran out of meal selection and could only offer seafood. FA checked available meals in Business class and offered fish which was fine with me. Crew generally have an excellent service attitude.

### Korean Air customer review
AKL-ICN-LHR. We have flown this route for the past 3 years with Korean and cannot fault them. Cabin staff were first class and attentive. Food was very good. We travelled with assistance and were pleased with the attention we got at all airports except LHR which was a bit of a shambles on arrival. Overnight stop at the Hyatt Regency in Incheon was excellent. They arranged for wheelchairs to meet us at the airport when we arrived on the hotel coach and took us through Immigration and security up to the business lounge and collected for boarding.

### Korean Air customer review
MEL-INC-LHR return. The stop over in Incheon was smoothly handled and we ended up in the Regency Hyatt. We traveled with a 4 year old and a 10 month old and staff couldn't have been more accommodating. Very happy customers.

### Korean Air customer review
YVR-ICN-HKT. First leg on older 772 uncomfortable seating seats may recline but lower extension non- existent. Older AVOD I had issues with sound it took 4 requests over 1 hour to several flight attendants. Food atrocious whether you choose Korean or Western! Cabin temperature was cold even at the front of Economy only good thing was usual Boeing toilets larger than Airbus 333. 2nd leg on newer 333 with AVOD II seats much better recline angle even with same 34" seat pitch as 772 only negatives was the cabin was too hot and food once again poor.

### Korean Air customer review
LHR-ICN-LHR . Food excellent both ways flat bed was not entirely flat and not entirely comfortable. Service on outbound flight was only OK as I was in the middle of a 2-3-2 layout on lower deck so the guys on the aisle side got the attention and I had to ask for the sweet and the cup of tea/coffee. Return on upper deck where service was really good. Internal flights in Korea GMP-ULS-GMP very comfortable and good service. Service on ground was good both in UK and Korea.

### Korean Air customer review
LHR-SYD via Seoul. Still the older style seating on a 747 upper deck which was the angled style - reasonable enough for a bit of a sleep but not super-comfortable. It was quiet so plenty of space in the cabin. The Korean food can be a bit of an experiment especially the seaweed prawns and tapioca for breakfast! Western options are available but they are happy to serve you a combination if you want to try. Very attentive service and a good choice of drinks. Cabin temperature was very warm. Both flights were very pleasant overall.

### Korean Air customer review
BKK-ICN-LAX return. Outbound to ICN on 77E and return on 773 to BKK. ICN-LAX return on A380. 77E had older IFE system but worked well and had the same movies as the latest system. Power plug and USB port a big feature. IFE is not as extensive as CX but had some good movies and music. Cabin Crew addressed me by name and confirmed my AVML which was tasty and they consistently made rounds with juice and water. Seats were very comfortable. A380 felt open and airy I would definitely fly again based on experience and value.

### Korean Air customer review
ICN-YYZ business ("Prestige") class. Flight attendants and purser were very friendly and efficient (although not as intensely efficient as Cathay). Food was above average quality for business class. Seats were comfortable but not the latest Korean Air offering but nothing to gripe about. IFE was a little sparse for a 12-hour flight but the films were current. Plane was 777-200.

### Korean Air customer review
Phuket-Seoul-Seattle on A330. A fantastic airline where only the bland small portioned rubbery food let's down a great product. Very roomy seat pitch brilliant AVOD touchscreen entertainment and friendly attentive staff. Seoul airport is full of amenities and the in transit airport hotel a great touch for lengthy stopovers. Over zealous security would be the only airport fault.

### Korean Air customer review
LAX-Incheon-Manila return. Very clean planes good leg room courteous FA's and very good service. Only comment is on my return trip the 747 from Incheon to LAX was old and we were unable to hear the pilots announcements. Worth it and will be taking this airline on my next trip to Manila specially with their new A380.

### Korean Air customer review
Phuket-Seoul-Seattle. Great flights clean modern A330 on both legs and pleasant attendants. AVOD brilliant only downfall was the atrocious Korean food on both legs! Tasteless rubbery and small portions sums it all up!

IAD-ICN-PNH return. Food was good flight attendants were very nice and helpful. Entertainment selection was pretty decent. On the return flight on 2 different occasions a flight attendant cleaned the bathroom before I went to use it. Flight attendants come around a lot with drinks. Will fly them again.

Sydney to London via Seoul return. Wonderful flight with friendly and efficient service. Food was good even the Korean food and kids meals superb. Entertainment system was good and for economy we seemed to have a large amount of leg room. Drinks and snacks were brought around regularly. Overnight stay in Seoul - could not fault it. Return flight similarly good. Highly recommended.

### Korean Air customer review
IAD-ICN-IAD. Boeing 747. Attentive detail-oriented staff efficient meal services comfortable completely flat-bed seat. Clean bathrooms. Although a lot of the inflight amenities kit were not located in front of the seat (only slippers were) when I asked for them (eye mask stocking earplugs water spray etc.) staff will bring them to you. All the toiletries were well-stocked in the bathrooms. Between meals there was a list of snacks I could choose from. I am most impressed with Korean Air.

### Korean Air customer review
Staff in particular were really helpful and kept the toilets clean throughout. The food was very good although the same menu flying from London to Seoul and Seoul to Auckland - be good to have more choice. The flat beds were good and we were also very impressed with the Hyatt hotel stopover at the airport in Incheon. Most helpful flight crews of any airline we have encountered.

### Korean Air customer review
A380 JFK-INC. Perfect plane but the product was very disappointing. Meals are a disgrace small unappealing and rushed. Minuscule wine glasses matched the portions. On all 4 flights a bloody mary order created chaos and each time was served without vodka. Amenities kit is an embarrassment with not even sleep masks. Passengers were an afterthought for the crew. Flights were 1/3 full I cannot imagine a full business class service.

JFK-ICN Economy. A380 is very roomy inflight service is excellent very good food. IFE with very good film options. Very good idea to have a duty free shop at the rear of the plane as it also has lots of room if you want to stretch a bit during such a long flight. Cabin crew very professional and courteous. Yes we can say that "excellence in flight" is the right logo for Korean Air.

LHR to MEL return. First time flying with this airline and found them to be very good. Check-in on all legs excellent staff very helpful. Seat as you would expect in economy. Food was acceptable. AVOD reasonable but could be extended. Staff were polite and helpful. Bathrooms kept spotless. The layover on the return leg at the Hyatt Regency Incheon was delightful. I will certainly be using this airline again.

JFK-MNL via ICN. Warmly welcomed onboard by friendly flight attendants. Economy seats were basic each seat had it's own screen. Footrests on the bottom of the seat a small detail but again necessary for long- haul flights. Inflight service began an hour after takeoff. Main course consisted of western meal and the traditional Korean. The ICN-MNL flight was the same great experience.

### Korean Air customer review
BKK-ICN and ICN-LAX in Prestige class. Both aircraft had lie flat seats good AVOD and good food. FA was gracious and helpful. After a long 5-hour layover in ICN I boarded the A380. I was in the first row upstairs and don't recommend that location as there's a lot of light and a bit of toilet and lounge traffic. The entire upper deck of the A380 is Business class seats.

### Korean Air customer review
No significant delays on any of the 4 flights on my return journey to NZ. Friendly efficient and courteous staff. Clean plane / facilities and as comfortable as an economy seat can be for a long haul flight! The over- night stopover in Seoul was a pleasure - very efficiently organised at both the airport and the hotel. My only grumble would be with the inflight food which was both boring and tasteless. I know it's an Asian airline but surely there's only so many times you can be offered seaweed soup!

### Korean Air customer review
LHR-SYD Economy class with my husband and 22 month old son. Checked in 2 hrs prior to departure after 30 minutes in line we found we had been assigned seats in different rows. We boarded only to sit on the tarmac for an hour. After take off my son became ill I pressed the buzzer for help and the stewardess arranged to get him to the medical centre in the airport after disembarking. When getting back on the flight we saw 3 side seats free however just before we took off another couple swapped their seats and took them. My husband had no inflight entertainment and it was unable to be fixed. As the plane began to descend into Sydney we were moved to Business class (which was 75% empty) so that quarantine could talk to us before we got off the plane. I can safely say that after my nearly 15 years in the travel industry I have never experienced such bad service.

### Korean Air customer review
BNE-LHR and return CDG-BNE. Both flights stopped overnight at the Hyatt Regency Incheon courtesy of KAL. The organization at Incheon airport was swift and efficient. Flights from and to BNE were by Airbus 330-300 from and to Incheon by Boeing 747-400. Airbus was comfortable with an excellent AVOD system while the Boeing was not as comfortable and the AVOD not up to the standard of the Airbus. Meals on all legs were average we were given a choice of Korean or Western and only one choice in each. Still at the price we obtained the fare KAL has to economise somewhere. No in-between meal snacks but plenty of water and juice. The real drawback was during daylight legs of the flights when the meals had been cleared away the cabin crew darkened the cabin insisting blinds be drawn.

### Korean Air customer review
ICN-KIX-GUM and GUM-ICN return both Economy. Travelled to Guam on an A330-300 which was well equipped with newer personal video-on-demand system and comfortable seats but return trip to Incheon on an old B747-400 was much less comfortable with terrible breakfast. We were offered a light meal during ICN- KIX and a dinner during KIX-GUM and both were good. Attendants were courteous and kind as were always. Check-in was quicker than expected at both ICN and GUM. Ground crew at KIX were attentive too.

### Korean Air customer review
Auckland via Seoul from Heathrow. The breakfast selection was very poor in that the only breakfast available was Korean. I think this is very poor as they should have catered to accommodate passenger requirements. The landing time to connection flight was only an hour and in that time you have to get through their internal security checks which takes up a lot of that time. So if you are thinking of getting your duty free you will not have allot of time as the connecting flight was delayed a little to accommodate the late passengers that was held up by internal security checks. Apart from that the rest of the flight was very good.

### Korean Air customer review
New Zealand via Seoul layover to London Heathrow. As a high risk epileptic at check-in my needs were explained considered and my service was exemplary from there on an upgrade to allow me to sleep fine food good service during the leg and the second / final leg I was given a full row again to accommodate my needs. Before my return Korean Air help desk staff contacted me and assisted me personally upon my return. A upgrade was again arranged wherein the service was once again excellent. Worth every penny they go the extra mile.

### Korean Air customer review
Chicago-Seoul-Manila. First flight from Chicago to Seoul was on a 747-4. 2nd flight Seoul to Manila was on a 777-3. Both flights offered personal TV's in the seat backs which was nice. The 777 was newer then the 747 however despite the 747's age it was still very clean and well kept. Staff on both flights were excellent. Always friendly and professional. I found the seats to be comfortable with a fair amount of leg room and good recline. The food on both flights was pretty good.

We travelled to Auckland via Seoul with Korean Air. Excellent value for money good entertainment which helped make our 25 hour journey pass quickly. Staff friendly and service good. On the flight home my friend was ill staff handled the situation very well. On arrival at Seoul we were met by friendly staff who took us on to the hospital.

### Korean Air customer review
ICN-CDG in Business. The lounge is Seoul is very nice quiet with a spectacular view to the apron. Flight was half empty. Seats were not completely flat and very uncomfortable both sitting and fully reclined. There seems to be something sticking against your bottom when seated. Staff were kind the food is an absolute disgrace. The wine glass they have is small though the crew came around several times for refilling. Inflight entertainment was rather limited. The arrival gate door in CDG would not open and everyone waited over 10 minutes. First batch of bags arrived on the carousel almost 40 minutes after landing during which time no information at all was given.

### Korean Air customer review
Crew were attentive and hospitable. Food choice refreshments plentiful and you didn't have to ask. The seat however was hard and for business class this is what you pay for. Easy controls to transform seat to lying position however the seat padding is hard and this needs to be looked into urgently.

### Korean Air customer review
Brisbane to Incheon A330-300. Efficient right from check-in at BNE. Flight attendants helped people find their seats put away baggage and made friendly conversation with passengers. Once in the air service was excellent. If you buzzed for a flight attendant there would be one beside your seat very quickly. However despite all the good parts of the flight we also learned that the inflight entertainment was still being upgraded on our route. All we had was a screen in the front of our section of the plane showing preselected movies.

### Korean Air customer review
Melbourne-Seoul-Dallas return. I think I saw the whole range of their fleet! MEL-ICH: Old stuffy 747. Entertainment range was good but screens poor. Staff exhausted and short with passengers. A little skimpy on the wine. ICH-DFW return: Nice enough Airbus comfortable clean. Fast check-in but wine almost impossible to come by. ICH-MEL. Brand new Airbus. Clean brilliant entertainment seats that slide forward a little when they recline so they they're a little flatter and nice flight attendants. Avoid vegetarian meals. They alternate between delightful curries and horrible slabs of fake-meat with gravy.

### Korean Air customer review
LAX-GRU in First Class. Overall an excellent flight. Korean Air is the only non stop option on this route and it is a shame the service is not offered daily. Upgraded from Business to First at the Gate. Lounge is unimpressive but its TBIT so I don't really blame them. Service was outstanding flat bed was comfortable. Dinner was a large amount of food and the AVOD very good. I slept the rest of the flight after dinner and woke up to a large breakfast. First Class cabin is very private with only eight seats. Crew seemed hidden for most of the flight but eager to help and had good command of English.

### Korean Air customer review
Honolulu-Seoul-Phnom Penh in Business Class. HNL-Seoul - seats food service entertainment - everything excellent. Change of plane in Seoul to an old 737 with terrible seats and video. Korean Air assumes it can use old planes on shorter flights (5.5 hrs) but fail to realize some passengers have already been in the air for 11 hrs and don't want to spend the last 5 hrs in uncomfortable seats. Would rate HNL-Seoul a 9 and Seoul-Phnom Penh 4.

### Korean Air customer review
Efficient service and no problems encountered on LHR-SEO then SEO-AKL return. I would recommend trying the more traditional Korean foods rather than the somewhat bland western meals. Staff were attentive and the seats were more than adequate.

### Korean Air customer review
Service was excellent additional extras for overnight comfort were appreciated. Flew Incheon to HCMC return both trips were excellent. I asked to change my seat to something closer to the exit and it was arranged immediately and with a smile. Mealwise - the meal was better than average. Entertainment options and customer service made Korean Air stand out.

### Korean Air customer review
December 2011 I and my 80 year old mother travelled Phuket via Seoul. My mother was apprehensive as she has mobility problems from the moment we arrived at Heathrow and the check-in desk staff were extremely helpful and attentive this service was matched by the wonderful inflight cabin crew on both flights and the service in Incheon airport in Seoul. Inflight service food and entertainment was very good but it was the extra service from staff that is to be recommended.

### Korean Air customer review
The flight itself was quite comfortable with an attentive crew. All the good service in the air is nullified by those on the ground. Check-in was a pain with staff running across different counters leaving passengers half-checked-in and stranded clueless with nobody serving. I witnessed one poor passenger ignored for a full 30 minutes. The smiles were superficial and the attitude snobbish. Once you get over this part the flight itself is reasonably comfortable. Food isn't fantastic though.

### Korean Air customer review
747-400 to Sydney Australia on December 10th return. At check-in I requested an exit row seat as I am 6 ft 3 I was given a window seat and was told the door sticks out but not enough to make me uncomfortable. This was a lie and I was very uncomfortable! On my second leg to Sydney I stuck with seat 56J back row window seat two seater I was much more comfortable despite the seats on Korean Air feeling like you're sitting on a bench. On my first leg they ran out of Diet Coke 2 hours into a 11 hour flight. I was offered Korean or Western food Korean food got a lot more than western food. Staff took 20 minutes to answer my bell. Staff brought round snacks once on all flights and the only thing offered was peanuts. They brought round drinks twice on all 4 long haul flights but didn't bring the drinks trolley round they brought round trays of orange juice and water. The only positive thing I can say is that the overnight stay at Harbour Park Hotel was nice and well organised.

### Korean Air customer review
Dec 2011 AKL-ICN flight on 747 -400. We travelled with 2 children 3 and 4 yrs old and were dreading the flight. We had pre-booked a row of 4 seats hoping we could lift the armrests so the kids could lay flat however we found the centre rest wouldn't move. This was the only downside to our flight the crew seemed to be ever present with snacks and drinks. Children's meals were of good quality as were the adult meals. IFE was also good. Crew provided children's goodie bags.

### Korean Air customer review
Disappointed with all aspects. I flew Ulaanbaatar to London via Seoul. Despite me telling check-in staff in Ulaanbaatar I needed my bags in Seoul as I had an overnight stopover they checked them through to London. The seats on Ulaanbaatar to Seoul leg had adequate legroom but the headrest was low digging into my back and shoulders. The food on both flights was terrible and inflight service was poor. Staff didn't have a good command of English and I could not understand the inflight announcements. Inflight entertainment was ok having spent £4500 on a business class return I was extremely unhappy.

### Korean Air customer review
London to Auckland via Seoul September 2011. Service exceeded all expectations. Massive amount of entertainment (on both flights) and the first time I'd seen touch screens. Excellent service and food. Perhaps this is because both planes seemed to be new. Journey to Auckland was on a jumbo - because of the Rugby World Cup. I will definitely travel with them again if the price continues to be so reasonable.

Economy Class ICN-SIN B777. Check-in very efficient. As an airline alliance gold card holder I was granted access to KE's very nice BC lounge at ICN. Cabin crew very professional. 3 hot meal choices in YC. I enjoyed the Korean bibimbap meal. Pre arrival I was also offered a hot snack. IFE was great. The largest duty free selection I've seen on any airline. All in all a great flight.

### Korean Air customer review
What a horrible flight. I used my points to upgrade to business class on a flight from Siem Reap to Seoul. The business class had no TV or entertainment seats about 20% bigger than economy that reclined no more than an economy seat. Throughout the flight economy passengers were allowed to come up and use the toilets in business class.

### Korean Air customer review
NRT-ICN-NRT. Flight into Seoul check-in was fast. Check-in for flight into Japan took so long (as flight's final destination was US) which was quite annoying as I felt they could have had a separate line for those dropping out of itinerary halfway. As a result shopping time in ICN was reduced considerably. As for flight attendants some provided really professional service can speak Japanese Korean and English fluently (same for some pilots inflight). As for the IFE they have a selection of new old Korean Hollywood European films some documentaries and sitcoms. Be cautioned though that selection was the same for the inbound-outbound flight. As for the food the rice dish was too small about 3/4 the normal size. Had been quite hungry for the rest of the flight.

### Korean Air customer review
I took two long trips from LA to Bangkok via Seoul the other flying LA to Beijing return from Hong Kong to LA. Both were in economy. The service is professional and attentive throughout. The bathrooms are kept spotlessly clean. The food is nothing to write home about but the option of Korean dishes is welcome. The entertainment selection is decent. The seats are very close together and the space is cramped. The only good seats are in the back of the plane but it is hard to reserve those. In previous years once one booked a ticket it was possible to call the airline and book the seats. Now they cancelled this option and one can only select seats 30 days in advance. They also tend to overheat the planes so plan to take your layers off after you board. Overall I would say it is 7 out of 10 and I'd recommend it to anyone who does not mind being cramped during flight.

### Korean Air customer review
Bangkok to Honolulu return. The seats were very small so not a comfortable option for elders with circulation problems. However staff were friendly frequently offering fresh juices and water during the long flight. Great selection of entertainment to keep me occupied. However the only drawback was that they take back the headphones too early before landing. Also too many inflight interruptions in 3 languages which virtually disrupts an entertaining experience. Food could be better.

### Korean Air customer review
Incheon to Dallas. I got an old 747 rather than a new 777. The flight was great good entertainment friendly staff and good food. The only problem is the seats are tiny. I sat down and my knees were wedged against the seat in front. When the seat in front was reclined the video screen was inches from my nose. Even so I'd fly them again.

### Korean Air customer review
Chicago O'Hare to Seoul return two weeks later. The seats were more comfortable with more leg room than expected so I was able to sleep in Economy Class. Flight attendants were professional and helpful. While the meals weren't always to my taste they were served and cleaned up efficiently. An unexpected perk was the layover in Seoul where I was able to enjoy the 4th floor "Rest and Relax" area.

### Korean Air customer review
My wife and I travelled to Seoul. I tried to reserve an aisle side 3 times before the flight but they refused even though they had plenty of aisles open. We wound up paying a premium price for the ticket as it turned out the seats were unbelievably cramped even though plane was touted as new "equipment". Flight attendants smiled but did not engage customers at all in conversation. Food portions were unbelievably small. It was a very disappointing experience at every customer touch point.

BNE-ICH-IST return LHR-ICH-BNE. Outward journey in October return in November. On very long flights surely inflight entertainment could be rotated. Same applies to the Menus - same on all flights east or west makes no difference. Cabin staff have a poor understanding of English - they didn't seem to be a staff member that could speak fluent English. All attendants seem obsessed with was serving food and getting the shutters down as soon as possible. When I board a day flight I do not want to sit in the dark for the next 10 hours. Other than the leg room advantage in Business class I feel it is a lot of money to pay for the privilege. Even the standard of Airport lounges have been downgraded.

Manila to LA and the flight was great. Staff were hospitable. Most impressive was how they handled a delay. My Manila to Seoul flight was delayed and I was going to miss my connection on arriving they had staff waiting to meet passengers and direct them to connections as fast as possible and had held up connecting flights so everyone could make flights. My flight was also delayed into LA where I had another connection. Once again there were staff waiting for us so they could direct and usher us as fast as possible to other connections.

JFK-ICN on A380. Staff are quite attentive boarding is orderly bathrooms are kept clean 180 degree flat beds and nice to have a manned bar at the back of the plane. Meals are above average. However unable to pre-book seats online unless a skypass member very limited AVOD for a 14 hour flight and overhead storage seems smaller and limited. Major advantage for me is that it flies direct from east coast.

### Korean Air customer review
CGK-ICN-YYZ. Good cabin crew although English skills are poor. Food was good. The PTV did not work well on the first leg because the touch screen was not responsive but the second leg was much better. The aircraft was clean. Overall I was impressed.

### Korean Air customer review
NRT-ICN-HKG return all on Prestige Class. Their A380-800 experience in business class is very good and so was the 777-300 but the older 747 service isn't quite so. I wish they were more consistent. Overall they provide good service clean lavatories clean aircraft well-dressed FA's and wonderful vegetarian meals. AVOD is good but on a long-haul may be very limited.

### Korean Air customer review
Brisbane-Seoul my wife flew Seoul-Toronto and I flew Seoul-London. Return flights the same routes. All flights left and arrived on time. All flights were business class and we saved $7000 on an alternative offering from Cathay Pacific. Cabin staff were very good English left something to be desired.

### Korean Air customer review
Chicago to Bangkok with 1 child and 1 infant. Advance seat assignment not been honored at the checkin due to plane change without any notification. One of my children ended up sitting on a seat without any parent around. Ground crew at Chicago did not want to offer any help. All they said that it was a full flight. I was there 2 hours and 30 minutes before departure. Plenty of time to assist and none whatsoever. Bad service for the 1st time flying with Korean Air. The funny part was same thing happened at BKK but the ground staff there was willing to help and I could sit with both of my children in the returning flight.

### Korean Air customer review
LAX to Narita return. Usual amenities including pillow blanket water slippers newspaper etc. Food was good but nothing outstanding. Cabin interior in good condition. Bathrooms kept clean. Inflight entertainment had good selection of audio and video programming. Cabin crew on return flight offered beverages frequently more so than on outgoing flight. No snacks were offered with exception of peanuts on initial beverage service.

### Korean Air customer review
BKK-ICN-LAX return. All flights on newly refurbished cabins on A330-300 and B777-300 and B777-300ER. Staff are attentive to any special requests or requirements. Food and drink service was very good. Nice greetings at ICN for my connecting flights by KE ground staff. KE boarding pass entitled me to a discount at the pay-in lounge at ICN. All transitions were smooth flight attendants were professional in addressing my needs. The price was good compared to other airlines.

### Korean Air customer review
JFK-ICN on 747-400 ICN-JFK on 777-300er The Business Class lounge at JFK is wanting. Limited range of refreshments are provided ie cheese crackers and muffin assortments. It is dimly lit and small. Onboard the flight menu hasn't changed much in 10 years. They serve red wine chilled in mini glasses. Overall the attention to detail in their customer service aspect has diminished over the years. Further the new 180 degree position seats are cold firm and uncomfortable. The Business Class lounge at ICN is large and well lit. However because ICN is the hub for KAL it is always packed with waiting passengers. I've also noticed over the years that the assortment of available food items has shrunk here also. Onboard I will never again fly 14+ hrs non-stop on a B777 too noisy and too cramped. Concerning the cabin crew the service is always better although nominally when flying out of the states. When flying back to the states the flight crew seem to have it in mind not to be as attentive to passenger concerns.

### Korean Air customer review
Incheon-Heathrow. A disappointing performance. Seats the most uncomfortable I have sat on in Business. Even in cradle position you still slide (and I'm only 1.70 meters). No drinks offered after take off until 1.5 hours into the flight. No aperitif - just 4 wines. Food boring with little taste. Video screen small movie selection far away from what other carriers offers. Flight attendants not really interested.

### Korean Air customer review
Bangkok to Pusan in Economy. You cannot pre-book seats online unless you join their program. So I had to get what was left at check-in on a pretty full flight. No refreshments or food offered or served after we departed from Bangkok until the early hours when landing in Pusan. Not a great traveling experience.

### Korean Air customer review
Sydney to London via South Korea. I was impressed by the legroom the quality of the plane (777) and the stewardesses. Toilets were cleaned every few hours more than plentiful food offered and a free 5 star stopover in Incheon.

### Korean Air customer review
BKK-ICN return in Economy. Seats have generous leg room. Staff excellent on both flights and always around to assist. One of the flight attendants went around the cabin giving pens to fill out arrival forms. IFE was great and it started working from before we took off until after we landed. Food was average which was the only let down on both flights. Good staff ground and onboard and this was the 2nd cheapest on this route without a stop.

### Korean Air customer review
LHR-ICN-MEL-ICN-LHR First flight on B747. Good flight service entertainment. Food lovely staff friendly and polite. Second flight to/from Melbourne on brand new A330 and same again excellent choice of entertainment and regular refreshments from friendly staff.

### Korean Air customer review
ATL-ICN on 747. Boarding went smoothly albeit the announcements were hard to hear and they actually just shouted zones. Onboard a feeling of being a big older but the seat had plenty of amenities: water blanket pillow slippers headphones. Seats fairly comfortable for an aisle seat. Cabin crew professional and polite. Food was tasty but the dinner was basic.

### Korean Air customer review
I was flying Los Angeles-Tokyo Tokyo-Incheon and Incheon-Manila. Seats were comfortable with new individual screens filled with varieties of entertainment options. The meal was good especially from Seoul to Manila.

### Korean Air customer review
HKG-ICN A380 ICN-FRA B777. First time flying Korea Air and I was impressed. Cabin crew smartly dressed friendly and efficient nothing was too much trouble. Cabins spacious and airy and spotlessly clean. Upgraded along with my partner to the Kosmo suites from Prestige class on FRA-ICN return sector although still prestige class service. I would suggest Korean Air include noise cancelling headsets for their Prestige Class and more AVOD choices for longer haul flights.

### Korean Air customer review
I flew to Saigon via Incheon. I asked for an exit aisle seat and got it with plenty of room. They fed us 5 times on the 14 hour flight to Incheon and 3 times on the flight to Saigon. Whenever I wanted a beer I got one and free of charge. Same for the return journey. The staff were very friendly and efficient.

### Korean Air customer review
NRT-ICN-DPS-SIN-ICN-NRT in Business class. Besides the fact the AVOD does not have an extensive list of choices for such long flights I cannot fault Korean Air. The flight attendants were well dressed smiling and spoke English well. The vegetarian special meals were inventive. I was lucky enough to fly the A380 between NRT and ICN and it is a joy. There is a full bar in the back and a mini one up front. The seats on the A380 are completely lie flat and very comfortable for sleeping if not a bit hard. The A380 is also extremely quiet. The lounge in Icheon was a bit overcrowded but it is the summer travel season.

### Korean Air customer review
SGN-IAD and return transferring at ICN both times. Hard working and well turned out staff. Spotless 777s. The terminal in Seoul is comfortable and affords easy transfer. Lots of leg room for average sized Western male. AVOD and catering more than adequate. Excellent value for money.

### Korean Air customer review
SYD-ICN-LHR-ICH-SYD. Ground staff and cabin crew were very helpful and friendly. Stopover in Seoul well organised with high quality food and accommodation at the Hyatt Incheon 5 mins from the airport. We flew on 747 and 777 200 both clean modern interior and spacious although the bulky inflight shopping magazines etc limited leg room. AVOD was functional on all legs though the small selection of movies and TV shows was definitely exhausted by the end of the last leg back into SYD. Value for money I could not fault Korean Air and would certainly recommend this airline.

### Korean Air customer review
I will not fly with them again (have done so twice in last 6 months) until they let some daylight into the cabin! I hate the way they close all the blinds and turn off lights basically straight after takeoff - even when I boarding at 7am in Auckland they rush your food out and then slam the whole show into darkness. You spend two days in the dark when flying with them from London to Auckland/Auckland London each time. I know they think it calms the passengers and gives the cabin crew less work if we are all in the dark but I am fed up with it. Everything else was great but until they let us see some daylight when flying I will not fly with them again even if they are the best price. I am sure that being shut up in the dark for so long on their flights contributes to jet lag on arrival.

### Korean Air customer review
Auckland via Seoul to Fukuoka. Flight leaving Auckland was delayed by about an hour which meant we missed our connecting flight to Fukuoka. However Korean Air put us up in a 5 star hotel in Seoul with Dinner and Breakfast. 7B47-400 Auckland to Seoul was spacious but slightly old. IFE system good but had no-where near the range of Emirates. Korean Air still give all children toys for the flight and economy class passengers a small toiletry bag. Flight attendant uniform very nice. Service onboard very polite and helpful. Found cabin staff presence through-out long haul flight quite low however - but when I pressed the call button an attendant would be there happily within a minute. Seat legroom good on both legs particularly for a short flight between Korea and Japan. A330 IFE much better than the 747 IFE. Meal between Seoul and Fukuoka was great but rather ambitious for such a short flight making the cabin crew on that leg very rushed. Only bad parts of this leg where the lack of cabin presence by attendants. Incheon airport very nice although Iprefer Hong Kong over Incheon. Biggest flaw with Korean Air is the terribly poor level of English spoken. I could understand if there was a low level of English between Fukuoka and Incheon. But between Auckland and Seoul I would expect to have at least one attendant fluent in English. But they often couldn't understand what I was saying which made organising what we had to do due to our late flight on the way over difficult with the flight attendants.

### Korean Air customer review
ICN-IAD Economy class. Ground service at Incheon was excellent. Everything was fast and smooth and it only took 10-15 mins for me to check-in clear security and pass immigration. FA's were very friendly and had smiles all the way to Washington DC. I enjoyed the hospitality throughout the flight. Inflight entertainment was very good quality. AVOD offered recent Hollywood box office movies TV comedy programmes and numerous other entertainment. Meal was excellent. Bibimbop was delicious pizza was offered as a snack. Sufficient leg room very clean loo. Korean Air even offers an amenity pack for Economy Class passengers.

### Korean Air customer review
SYD-ICH-LON (return). Cabin crew food inflight entertainment overall service and experience all of a very high standard. In addition it was a child-friendly service. The SYD-ICH-LON leg comes with a stopover in Seoul as part of the ticket price. This was great (even if the queuing at Icheon Seoul airport was a bit onerous) and we arrived in London very refreshed. The return LON-ICH-SYD was hard work. Both legs are overnight flights with a 5hr wait at Icheon airport. It could be worth a stopover - particularly if travelling with a child. Overall based on my experience I would definitely recommend Korean Air.

### Korean Air customer review
ICN-PVG roundtrip in Y. Newly refurbished A330 is great. Big LCD touch screen wide and comfortable seats and great pitch. The plane is as good as new. Flight attendants were well groomed with fancy uniform. However they were more interested in grooming and selling duty free items than actually serving passengers. Meals were mediocre at best they were rushed to the passengers followed by quick collection to open up for the duty free sales. Great hardware but no human touch.

### Korean Air customer review
I took Korea Air new aircraft airbus-380 flight between Tokyo (Narita)-Seoul (Incheon) last month. It was really smooth flight and even in Economy Class the seat is very conformable. Airbus is very quiet and smooth on route. Flight Attendant are all friendly and polite but they seem to be a bit nervous for new aircraft. As for Japanese citizen often fly to Korea I am always impressed by both mega carriers of Korea Korean Air and Asiana for their good services and conformable aircraft compare to JAL and ANA. The quality of services on Korean Air and Asiana are getting better year by year instead JAL and ANA are getting bad. However inflight meal of Korean air is not preferable for the short leg flights.

### Korean Air customer review
SGN-ICN-IAD: immaculate 777s on both legs. Lots of leg room and recline good AVOD. Ground staff in SGN was excellent with an easy transfer through ICN. Lots of leg room and recline. FAs were professional & helpful. They were also stylishly turned out which matters. I do miss the Korean entrees that this excellent airline used to offer.

### Korean Air customer review
LAX-ICN-KUL. One of the bad parts of the trip was a 13 hour layover in Seoul but Korean put us in a hotel for free - we could have opted for a free four hour tour of Seoul. All staff very polite and friendly inflight entertainment system was great. Staff brought drinks around about every 45 minutes. We were on an older B747 towards the back but it was two seats instead of three so gave us a lot of space to put everything. One nice thing they handed out slippers!

### Korean Air customer review
Extremely disappointing customer service. Beware of buying sleeper seats - they have often switched planes on me last minute without notice and don't make up the difference between the sleeper seat and regular business class seats. My experiences with the Korean Air representatives is that they are extremely rude and unprofessional. I fly to Korea often but find that Asiana Airlines is a much better choice.

### Korean Air customer review
IAD-ICN-HKT-IAD Boeing 777 with good seat pitch able to stretch legs and comfortable for economy. Excellent AVOD with large screens and new movies to choose from. Cabin was very clean and cabin crew friendly and helpful. Seoul is a really nice airport to transit through.

### Korean Air customer review
Seats quite comfy good legroom cabin clean. Flight attendants attentive and polite although English is not their strong point. Meals were decent although it felt quite rushed during meal times. By the time I got mine someone would be strolling by offering coffee or beginning to clear away trays. AVOD excellent with latest movies. The newer planes had USB ports to charge your ipod. I received a free stopover in Seoul outbound and that was terrific although quite disorganised at the airport.

### Korean Air customer review
Internal flight Daegu - Incheon on which my wife and I had a confirmed booking. Normal check and security clearance proceeding through to departure lounge. Shortly prior to scheduled departure the departure notice board advised the flight was on hold. No advice was given as to action required. After a lot of confusion we proceeded back through security to find our baggage dumped in the checking area without any advise or security. Korean air staff were ineffectual and totally unprepared for any form of customer aid. We experienced a delay of approx. 3.5 hours and eventually made our connecting flight.

### Korean Air customer review
ICN-YVR. Check in and ground service at Incheon excellent. Inflight service disorganized and of poor quality. Cabin crew have poor to non-existent English language skills. My seat 10J was hard and made sleeping difficult. Minimal seat upholstery. Overhead luggage bins utilized to store cabin service equipment or crew luggage. Older model 777-200. Food quality is deteriorating each year. Menu selection the same as two years ago. First class is similar but not worth the extra tariff for the same service level and amenities as Business.

### Korean Air customer review
LHR-ICN my first class flight experience and was expecting something very special. Reality was a disappointment and not much better than business class - certainly not worth considerable extra expense or air miles. Seats recline to 180 degrees instead of 160 for business but otherwise everything is the same. Discovered that the seat next to me which was empty at takeoff was marked with a sign for flight attendants to rest! Attendants resting in first class? Service from the attendants was super-smiley and Koreans are renowned for their hospitality - almost too much at times and it can be hard to get some peace and privacy. Cutlery was strange : metal forks and spoons but plastic knives which I suspect were recycled. I know that metal knives are a security issue but other airlines use blunt-ended metal ones in business. Food was certainly no better than business class and the whole experience was similar to KLM business class without the grumpy KLM flight attendants.

### Korean Air customer review
LAX-ICN-SYD-SEA horrible service for the most part. Flight Attendants performed minimal of service. We needed to change our meal service on every leg of trip to accommodate other passengers. Went over three hours before we saw a flight attendant at one point.

### Korean Air customer review
LHR-ICN-MEL return. We found the legroom perfectly acceptable on B747 and Airbus. Toilets were cleaned regularly. During daytime flights the cabin crew came round regularly with soft drinks (alcohol on request) and during the night flights were checking on passengers. The meals were good and entertainment excellent. The 20 hour stopover in Seoul at the Hyatt Regency was excellent lovely room dinner and breakfast was included with a voucher for sandwich or buffet lunch at the airport before our flight. I chose Korean Air because their flights to Australia were 300 pounds per person cheaper than all the other major airlines.

### Korean Air customer review
SYD-ICN-LHR return. Excellent value for money downside is legroom on 747 which seems to not be comfortable for people over 5ft 8. I would strongly recommend to anybody to book a seat in the back 3 rows of economy which for some reason have more legroom and are seated in pairs. Staff friendly and happy and I was well looked after. Inflight entertainment excellent. Choice of Korean or Western dishes. Good food. Included a free stopover on outbound flight an excellent 4 star hotel in Seoul with meals provided. Seoul Airport excellent for entertainment shopping and transit stops.

### Korean Air customer review
Friendly and helpful staff recommended for the families travel with kids. Food is not the great but not bad. The transit hotel provided was fantastic and hotel staff friendly and supportive. Most of the staff speak English but not fluently. Flights are comfortable and are equipped with touch control entertainment system in Economy class.
