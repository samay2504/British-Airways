### "The tickets are so overpriced"
Will never use them again. Booked a return ticket from Seoul to Novosibirsk via Vladivostok. The airline cancelled the return flight just one week before departure without any explanation. The refund was not received till now. First they said it will take 10 days, after 1 week they said 30 days. Cannot trust even a word what call center says. The flights from ICN to OVB were horrible. The line in Incheon airport was so slow, because airlines didn't want to pay to get more ground staff. The food on board is just a joke, impossible to eat. The water is provided only if you ask for it. Flight attendants don't bother to wear face masks at all. The seats are the most uncomfortable I've ever seen. The tickets are so overpriced. They charge the price of high quality airlines but provide the service below low cost carriers. Will never even think to fly with them again. Would prefer Aeroflot via Moscow. The flight is longer but much more comfortable. S7 should change their customer service policy or just stop operations.

### "I won't use their website ever again"
I booked the flight for my Christmas holiday via the S7 website in the summer. On 16 October they informed me that one of the sectors was cancelled. They couldn't provide any alternatives as all their flights around the Christmas period were full. I had to buy tickets with another carrier, paying double of what I previously paid. When I raised a refund with S7, they made me pay an additional cancellation fee. I won't use their website ever again.

### "Excellent service, thank you!"
Excellent, safe, clean, on time, and we got a hot meal on board, which I did not expect, given the fact that during the ticket purchase I was prompted to buy a meal, which I did not want to do. They are a little bit expensive, but  the flight took a long time (4.5 hrs). Excellent service, thank you!

### "the worst airline in Russia"
If I am to name the worst airline in Russia, it would most definitely be S7. Service as lowcost, prices are not. The flight was delayed for 2 hours. I understand, it happens. But to make all passengers sit on the plane the whole time? The plane was packed, during the pandemic, with no legroom at all. What a terrible experience that was. When flight attendants offered refreshments, I wasn't able to open the table, there was just not enough space. I knew how awful this airline was before booking, had some previous experiences, but sadly on that day I didn't have any other choice.

### "left at Alicante airport"
Alicante to Almaty via Moscow. March 15, 2020, checked in, received a boarding pass. Before boarding, they were taken off the flight and left at Alicante airport, explained their actions by the situation with coronovirus. Tickets were bought back a long time ago, is it really impossible to somehow manage humanly in this situation. Does the whole world in a difficult situation really need to do this? I’m standing at the airport opposite the office of this company. They all left the phone. I’m calling the offices, nobody picks up the phone. | 15 марта 2020 года, сдал багаж получил посадочный талон. Перед посадкой сняли с рейса и оставили в аэропорту Аликанте, объяснили свои действия ситуацией с короновирусом. Билеты выкуплены давно, неужели нельзя как то по человечески обойтись в данной ситуации. Весь мир в сложной ситуации неужели нужно так поступать? Я стою в аэропорту напротив офиса этой компании все ушли трубку звоню в офисы никто трубку не поднимает. Билеты цены космические.

### "good value for money"
St Petersburg to Moscow. Efficient check in. Comfortable seats and a fairly decent snack (sandwich). Certainly good value for money and spot on with departure/landing times. Would use again.

### "very good experience"
Osaka to Vladivostok. Second time to fly S7; very good experience from check-in, to boarding time/procedure, and flight itself. Check-in was smooth, boarding was quick and efficient. The aircraft was new, the legroom was decent, and the snack offered in-flight surprisingly good. Total flight time was about 2h, we landed 20 minutes earlier than scheduled. Overall, high marks for S7.

### "not allow my hand luggage"
Tyumen to Moscow. I bought a  ticket from Tyumen to Johannesburg, South Africa but when I checked in at Tyumen airport, they would not allow my hand luggage. They insisted it was not allowed although I bought the ticket through S7.

### "Slow on board service"
Guangzhou to Moscow. Slow on board service and inattentive ground staff. it took two hours to get my tomato juice after I repeatedly requested it from cabin flight attendants.

### "Highly recommended"
Paphos to Sochi via Moscow. Excellent company and the only one that I'm using for travels to Russia. Very reasonably priced tickets. They are the only company which offers perks before you reach silver status which requires at least 20 flights/20000 miles (e.g. free luggage if you have done 12 flights). On that particular flight, the crew was nice (as always), food was great (for an economy ticket) and the seats were comfortable. Highly recommended and hopefully they will continue growing!

### "useless customer service"
Moscow to Krasnoyarsk. One of the worst customer service in Russia. An absolutely useless customer service. I was overcharged for baggage fees. I was trying to reach out to supervisor for 1-month through phone and email and the correspondence was extremely slow and absolutely useless. This company reps are very incompetent and rude and still living in the 20th century.

### "cost efficient upgrade fee"
It was 2 sectors from Novosibirsk to Vladivostok and then transfer from Vladivostok to Seoul. Baggage was checked-in through to final destination, which is very comvinient. Online check-in via app with cost efficient upgrade fee> (from Vladivostok to Seoul only 53 USD). Food was good. Entertainment system including map, movies, music etc is broadcasting by Wi-Fi to your own device, which is better for my since I can use my own headphones and no advertisement.

### "professional and attentive"
Not Verified |  Novosibirsk to Hong Kong. This was my return sector of my trip to Russia. Aircraft was a new B737-MAX8. Flight attendant dedicated to the business cabin. Only 8 seats in the business cabin. Great for making new friends! No lie flat bed, seats very comfortable and plenty of leg room. Flight attendant was professional and attentive. Food was very good.

### "service was wonderful"
Not Verified |  Hong Kong to Novosibirsk. My very first trip to Russia, in the business class cabin. The aircraft was a new Boeing 737-MAX8. Service was wonderful. Flight attendant's English was basic but we understood each other very well,thanks to my elementary and enthusiastic Russian I had learnt before going to Russia ! Food was very good. No lie flat bed but plenty of space. Only 8 seats in business cabin so very intimate.

### "thank the S7 Saratov team"
I would like to thank the S7 Saratov team for the support they have provided to me yesterday flight (Dec 7th) to Moscow. Due to the travel agency issue, my return flight from Saratov to Moscow was canceled by mistake. I will claim with this travel agency later. What I want to highlight is how professional were the staff members to find a solution knowing that all flights were booked. Finally they found a solution and were so happy to inform me. Yes there were happy! Congratulation to S7 for team spirit and being customer oriented.

### "the price is really low"
Moscow Domodedovo to Dusseldorf. It was good, I can't say that it is bad, but it wasn't really nice, nice crew, good food, a select of drinks, very old aircraft, and uncomfortable seats. In fact, the price is really low!

### "seats were comfortable"
AER-DME with S7 Siberia Airlines. Mobile check-in was quick and efficient. The aircraft was quite old but the seats were comfortable and had decent legroom. The chicken sandwich was tasty and sufficient for a 2 hour flight. Cabin crew were efficient, though not very friendly. Overall, a decent flight for a good price.

### "Avoid this company"
Verona to Samarkand via Moscow. Avoid this company at all costs. My first flight was delayed more then 2 hours and I lost my connection in the process. I was diverted to TAS the following morning after a whole night spent at Moscow DME airport, and the company refused to arrange and pay for the ground transport between TAS and SKD. A baggage was lost in the process and recovered only after a week. Finally, it is not possible to contact the company for complaints and refunds, as they accept only written complaints sent by ordinary mail to an address in the middle of Russia. Such a company should be banned to fly inside the EU.

### "a pleasant experience"
Palma de Mallorca to Moscow. Check-in was a breeze. The aircraft was new and clean. Seats were in a 2-2 layout and were comfortable. Cabin crew were polite, professional and efficient. In terms of catering, the Greek salad and the desert were fantastic. A pre-landing fresh apple-cucumber-mint juice was a fantastic touch. Huge kudos to the airline’s creative team. The design of boarding passes, reading and marketing materials and the aircraft livery are definitely making S7 one of the most stylish airlines in the world. Flight delayed by about 30 minutes due to heavy traffic (not the fault of the airline). Hot meal options were mediocre at best. No IFE for a 4.5 hour flight. The ticket price was expensive and comparable to Aeroflot. Overall a pleasant experience with S7 Airlines. Up to its possibilities, the airline delivers a great product in terms of quality. Though, you would expect a lower price tag for what was on offer.

### "disastrous flight experience"
Dushanbe to Seoul via Novosibirsk. This was the most disastrous flight experience I’ve ever had with any airline. It’s actually hard to describe all the things which went wrong and the amazingly terrible service I received in just 1 review. But for me it was 42 hours of hell. Firstly, my booked flight from Dushanbe to Seoul was clear (to me) that it could not occur as the first flight was delayed. As soon as I was advised of this I went into the S7 office in Dushanbe to see what could be done and if I’d need to delay my flight altogether or what other action could be taken. I was assured by them that there would not be a problem. When I checked in for the first flight, I again expressed my concern about how I would get to Seoul when the first flight arrived after the departure time of the second flight. Again I was told it would not be a problem and when I asked if that meant the second flight would be held up for me, I was told that it would. I was still not convinced as they checked my bag through to Seoul but could not give me the ticket for the second flight. Again I checked with the lady who was looking after business class on the first flight. Again she said not to worry as there was a chance that the aircraft I was currently in would also be used for the flight to Seoul? Arrived at my connecting airport, Novosibirsk and, as I feared the second flight had already left. The S7 rep there told me that he had told Dushanbe airport that anyone without a Russian visa should not board the plane. Thus, I was stuck at the airport in transit for nearly 24 hours. This is where the real fun began. After 12 hours I demanded some water (had my own up until that point) but was told I would have to wait (but how long I was never told). Ended up being issued an itinerary to fly via Shanghai and was told my luggage would be checked straight through. Then another person started their shift (I was there a looong time); and she said I would have to pick up my baggage and take it through in Shanghai. I expressed my concern with this as I do not have a visa for China but this concern was basically ignored and I guess, deemed as being my problem. Anyway, after being given two eggs for breakfast, I then had to find an S7 person so that I could have some lunch. I was lucky to locate her on this occasion. 8 hours after lunch, no one had come to see me and although I looked and looked, there were no S7 reps in the transit area unless there was a flight leaving so I could not contact anyone. Ended up messaging S7 via Facebook to ask them to get someone to come and see me. About an hour later there was a rep at last. I asked regarding a meal and he said “from what I’m told you have already been served a meal”. I said “yes I have, 8 hours ago. Do you wait 8 hours between meals? No.” So that was that, no meal. And then I did have a lot of trouble getting into China to collect my baggage but obviously that is not S7’s problem as their only mission was to get me off of their hands. The subsequent messages and emails from S7 have been appalling and have also made me realise that everyone was well aware that I should never have boarded the first flight but no one wanted to take any accountability and deal with the problem (which was caused by them!). I’m just getting the ‘sorry for the inconvenience’ line. No accepting of responsibility and certainly no compensation offered (I was also out of pocket for accommodation I had booked in Seoul). Use this airline at your own risk.

### "Gladly surprised"
Gladly surprised. Travelled with them 3 times - Alicante to Moscow, Moscow to St Petersburg and St Petersburg to Alicante. All flights on time with good service and modern aircraft.

### "it was a very good flight"
Moscow to Nizhnekams. The check-in crew were friendly and professional. The boarding process was a bit unorganized because we had a delay for about 45 minutes. On board the crew welcomed us with a drink wich smelled good and fresh. The cabin was a bit old but the legroom was excellent and the seat comfortable. It was a night flight so we got only a sandwich. The sandwich smelled good. All in all it was a very good flight with a professional and friendly crew.

### "airline did not provide any help"
Moscow to Bangkok via Novosibirsk. I bought my ticket on orbitz. It showed I had a 23kg check in luggage. But when I came to the airport the airline said I did not. It forced me to pay. The staff was rude, impolite, slow and unprofessional. Their payment system was down and could not process it. As a result the flight left without me and my family. The airline did not provide any help.

### "Will avoid this company"
Seoul to Novosibirsk. Quite bad experience. The tickets are too overpriced according to what you get. Check in at Incheon airport was terrible. Only 2 counters were available for this flight, I had to wait for more than 1 hour and a half to just check-in. When I was done with check-in, there were only 30 minutes left before departure, but about half of the line was still there. Airlines representative said that the flight will be in time, so I have to run through customs, passport control and train to concourse. Finally the flight was delayed for more than 1 hour. The flight takes more than 5 hours in tiny A320. OK, the plane is brand new but with really low and cheap options. No IFE at all, the food is too small and doesn't taste good. Flight attendants are not friendly. The restrooms were so dirty. After 2 hours of the flight there was no toilet paper or tissues left at all. Flight attendants didn't care at all. On the way back from OVB to ICN we had to walk to the plane on tarmac because the company didn't want to pay for a jet bridge. It was -22 degrees outside. The flight was exactly the same. No IFE, no service, dirty restroom but in-time. No baggage is included to the ticket. Service and facilities are like in really cheap Asian low cost companies. You have to pay for everything including seat selection. The seats are just terrible for long flight. But the price is like for 5 start companies for the same flight duration. Will avoid this company for my future trips if possible. Not recommended if you have any other option.

### "I liked it a lot"
I visited my relatives in Mineralnye Vody flying from  Moscow Domodedovo with my mother and flew with S7. I liked it a lot, food was good, I got two chicken sandwiches which were fresh and tasty. I want to add that S7 have the most beautiful planes I’ve ever seen, the green color makes you feel positive from the first sight.

### "The flight was really good"
Moscow to Mineralnye Vody. It was the first time that I bought simple economy class without any luggage. Previous experience with Russian low-costs was far from successful, but before that I used S7 services a lot, so that made me choose that option. Also regarding the fact, that tickets were the cheapest ones at that moment. The flight was really good. Punctual, with friendly cabin crew and nice green airplane (I like their design and it’s an important factor for me). However, I want to leave some life hacks for that tariff option, that may help future passengers to avoid some undesirable obstacles and enjoy the flight as I did. I’ve seen here some critic about that proposal of S7 and I guess often the reason is, that we’re are not used to such types of flights. First of all, be aware what is included in your ticket and what isn’t. In the case of basic economy class it’ food, beverages and 10 kg of hand luggage. You have to pay for a normal luggage and choosing the place in plane. Important thing - if you bought tickets together, it makes no sense to pay for a place to sit also together. A system will make it automatically, so just save your money. In case of additional luggage - it’s better to purchase it in the internet. It will be cheaper than in the airport. In the airplane there isn’t always a lot of free space for hand luggage, but if you have a problem - just ask the stewardess. They are pretty friendly and always here to help. Also if food portion was small for you - you can always ask for additional one. Regarding my experience with S7, cabin crew will never say no.

### "trip left the good impression"
Moscow to Varna. My last trip to S7 happened in the end of August. I’m using their priority system, collecting miles flying with S7 in Russia and their partner Air Berlin in Berlin. Must say it works pretty well, I’ve never tried to buy tickets for miles, but I change often to the upper class and use their business lounge in airports. To Varna I also flew in business. That time we had a small delay. As we were told after, because of weather conditions. Less than one hour, but not the best thing anyway. Fortunately during the flight everything was fine. S7 have good choice of food in business class, a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables. There is almost no difference between in-land and abroad flights, except that cabin crew can speak English really fluent. Generally, that trip left the good impression. Would use their service further

### "never saw smile of the crews"
Vladivostock to Seoul Incheon. Everything is lime green, the planes, the laboratory, parts of the crew uniform, and etc. Planes looked relatively modern, the inside of planes are quite clean, but laboratory always kinda dirty. Quality of service was decent. However, the few times I flew with S7, never saw one smile on any of the crews, ground, at gate, or in the air. Food was terrible, so was drink options. However, for the many cities it serves, this is probably the best choice.

### "liked the low-cost version of S7"
Moscow to Simferopol and it was the  first time for me when I bought S7 tickets without luggage. First of all, there was a fee for choosing a seat, but the check-in online was possible. I didn’t even need to go to the check-in counter in Domodedovo. The flight was punctual. We did not wait for a bus, but came to the plane directly with a jet bridge. In the plane,  it took more time for everyone to pack the hand luggage, maybe because the majority had the same tickets as me. However, regarding the price it was understandable. During the flight we got sandwiches and beverages. The choice of sandwiches was between cheese and chicken. They were pretty tasty. On the way back everything was almost the same. So I would say I really liked the new low-cost version of S7. Excluding the luggage and fee for seats I got the same quality, but for a lower price.

### "stewardesses spoke really fluent English"
We flew with my wife and son from Barcelona to Yekaterinburg through Domodedovo (S892 & S091). To be honest after three months in Europe we were a bit scared by the flaws of Russian service. However, it was not the case of S7 Siberia Airlines. I felt that I was not in Spain anymore only when I saw the crowd of arguing taxi-drivers in our home airport Koltsovo. All the stewardesses spoke really fluent English and were friendly and polite. We were allowed to take baby food on board and the children were give a present immediately at the plane entrance. The food for adults was also fine. Most of all I liked the fact that for the both flights we got new Airbuses and the takeoff and landing were really quiet.

### "attendants were friendly"
St Petersburg to Sochi via Moscow return with S7. Check in at St Petersburg and Sochi was quick and efficient. The check in counter at Sochi encouraged us to get a refund as check in baggage of less than 10 kg was free (this is a recently introduced measure to encourage checking of small bags). All flights left and departed on time and were comfortable. The cabin was clean and the attendants were friendly. Light refreshments were served on each sector. There was no in flight entertainment but these were relatively short internal flights so IFE was not expected.

### "the flights were on time"
Moscow - Vienna. Nice flight. I’ve already used S7 for domestic flights, so decided to fly with them internationally and I was pretty satisfied by the whole trip. The aircraft were fine. I guess it was A319 for both ways. There was enough space for the legs in the economy seats (my height is 1.84m) and both planes looked new. Lunch was not very big, but tasty enough. The choice of beverages was a bit limited. What I find important - all the flights were on time. The workers in airport and on board made they job quickly and professional.

### "atrocious experience"
Novosibirsk to Beijing. Absolutely atrocious experience. Flight was delayed by one hour- which was fine. However, a representative came and then informed me that S7 had cancelled my connecting flight from PEK to HKG. They did not even ask my permission. They also told me that they had put me on a different flight. However, this exact flight changed twice before I was finally put on a completely different flight altogether. My new flight was 12 hours later that original. Despite there being at least 5-6 other flights with OneWorld affiliates before that one. At PEK the S7 staff were incompetent and did not offer us any compensation, vouchers or substantive apology. The flight itself was fine but absolutely disgusted by their incompetence!

### "comfortable time of departure"
Yekaterinburg to Moscow Domodedovo. The main advantages for me – comfortable time of departure (at 6:10 from Yekaterinburg, 6:40 arrival in Domodedovo), punctuality and flexible prices. I don’t need luggage, so I appreciate that I don’t have to pay for it. However, I buy priority seats. Usually, they are free at that time, so I get the whole row for myself. The flight lasts less than 2 hours, but S7 provides food (sandwiches with chicken or vegetables) and new press. Unfortunately, they have the flight back too early in the evening, so I have to choose other airlines. What becomes a pity every time, because in the quality-price ratio of S7 seem to be one of the best in the market.

### "impressed by quality of service"
Yekaterinburg to Munich via Moscow. I flew with S7 Siberia Airlines in July 2016 to Munich and was impressed by quality of the service and the cabin crew. The food on board as I remember was really tasty. So I got really good impression. The only thing that surprised me, that on the way from Munich to Moscow there was a lot of free seats..

### "do not expect exceptional service"
I fly with S7 20-30 segments per year and around 30 segments with different airlines. While the main reason for my choice is being on time, I like the seats all covered with leather and enough legroom for my 190 cm height. The meals I would assess as average. All aircrafts are relatively new except two B767. For the last consequential five years they had never lost my baggage, in contrast with three lost luggages by Aeroflot. I would recommend this airline for those who want to be on scheduled time and do not expect exceptional service. Their website is also very convenient.

### "the cabin temperature was uncomfortably warm"
I flew to Kazan from Moscow Domodedovo for a weekend visit on S7 Airlines on 10 and 12 February 2017. Flying domestically within Russia is very inexpensive, so it is affordable for many people. The result is that both flights were at capacity. Boarding was late on both flights, starting at the time the gate was supposed to close according to the ticket schedule. As with other Russian airlines, there is no pre-boarding or boarding by zones. Once the gate opens, it is a rush to board. It is important to board early on a budget airline like S7, because with bag charges, everyone tries to carry on as much as possible, and the overhead compartments fill quickly. Despite the chaotic boarding, both flights departed close to schedule. On both flights the cabin temperature was uncomfortably warm for me, but if you live in Russia, you know that Russians like it warm - very warm. I sat in economy and, although I don't consider myself tall at 180 cm, my knees were pressed up against the seat in front of me -- Absolutely no leg room at all. If you are taller than I am, you will be very uncomfortable. (See my photo) It was a short flight - only about 90 minutes. The flight attendants were very business-like and focused on getting the passengers a meal and drinks in the short time we were airborne. A bland sandwich and your choice of water (at cabin temperature) or hot tea was what you got. More than one would expect on a short flight, but not very high quality. I would have preferred just a cold beverage to cool me off in the warm, stuffy cabin. In the end the flight was what you would expect for 8000 rubles (138 USD): Not great, but what do you expect?

### "onboard the product is quite good"
Moscow to Samara with S7. Staff at check-in don't speak much English but the service is quite efficient. Outbound flight delayed with minimal communication - eventual boarding via bus was particularly unpleasant in the Moscow snow. Onboard the product is quite good - reasonable legroom for a 1h30m flight. One bar service (juices, water and hot drinks) and a decent sandwich. Staff onboard spoke English and all annoucements in Russian and English. Return trip identical and again good - would recommend for short domestic flights.

### "leg room and recline was adequate"
Check in was efficient and fast. The Business Cabin was full. There were drinks at the pre takeoff stage. Flight was a little late boarding and taking off. The flight was comfortable and the food service adequate. There was no IFE on a six hour flight. Leg room and recline was adequate and given the length of the flight could have been better. Level of service was only adequate and airline on this experience barely justifies its three star rating. S7 Siberia Airlines recommended only for the value for a direct flight from Bangkok to Irkutsk.

### "post flight service is terrible"
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk to Tokyo via Vladivostok with S7 Siberia Airlines. After flying from Sakhalin to Vladivostok S7 lost my bag. My bag didn't turn up in Tokyo for a further 5 days and was missing for most of my vacation. S7 didnt care about this and i had to phone both Sakhalin and Vladivostok airports many times from my vacation to track down my bag. Eventually it turned up and I subsequently found out that S7 just didnt take it off my initial flight and sent it to another city in Russia, then they kept hold of it until they had another flight to Tokyo to get it to me, rather than trying to get it to me as quick as they could they chose to try to save themselves money without caring about their passenger. I had to buy some clothes and toiletries as I didnt have my bag for 5 days and on return home wrote to S7 about this. I spent hundreds of dollars on international phone calls to find my bag and get it delivered to the right place, on clothes I bought that I didnt need - S7 offered me $23 in compensation and only after a 10 month investigation finally accepting it was their fault as they couldn't find anyone else to blame. S7 post flight service is terrible and if you are an international traveller and have an issue they will not help you, they will go out of their way to make it difficult for you to get information and to get a resolution to your issue.

### "A320 legroom was more"
The HKG-OVB (Globus S7) flight was one of the worst flights I've been on. The Boeing 737-800 looked really old and run down, and was hot and stuffy for the 7 hour 30 minute flight. Hardly any legroom and very narrow seats. My Dad's seat on 5C could not recline at all. All the cabin crew on the flight seemed to have a bad temper which may be due to the fact that they only arrived 1 hour ago in HKG from a 7 hour flight from Novosibirsk. The seat was pretty uncomfortable and hardly reclines. No entertainment. Food was fine and tasted good. However, the flight to Moscow with S7 was better on the A320 where the legroom was more than adequate and the seats were designed better, giving a more comfortable flight. According to S7 Airlines, it states that one could bring as many carry on baggages but need to be under 10kg, however in Novosibirsk the ground service staff said only one and made us pay 2000RUB to ship it to Moscow. I would fly S7 Siberia Airlines again in the future, but I would avoid S7 Globus Boeing 737-800 flights at all costs.

### "the food is not satisfying"
It is 2 years since I first flew with S7 Airlines and it has changed. I flew Moscow (DME) to Ulan-Ude on a new and clean A320. Staff was polite, smiling and nice sence of humour, including captain. There is an auto speaker, which is perfect. But the food is not satisfying. Compared to Aeroflot, Ural Airlines and Yakutia, S7 Siberia Airlines offer no alcohol, no soda drinks, paper boxes, no ice. And no inflight entertaiment at all.

### S7 Siberia Airlines customer review
DME-EVN and back. Amazing mobile app and check-in, got flight information updates regularly on my phone. DME airport on the other hand is horrible : a never-ending queue from check-in to customs and passport control. Arrived 2.5 hrs before departure and still was almost late for the flight. Got upgraded to business class on both legs for free. Seats comfortable for a 3-hour flight. Cabin crew did not smile but were efficient. Pasta was delicious on flight from Moscow, however food on return flight was pretty bland.

### S7 Siberia Airlines customer review
Flew from Beijing to Novosibirsk Siberia airlines is the only carrier on this route so no choice flight left Beijing on time (crazy time of 6.45 in the morning which means you need to get up at 4). Airplane new and clean FA's do not smile hide themselves after a serving lousy food and drinks. Had to pay 50 dollars for a little overweight. Novosibirsk airport is under construction no trolleys to be found.

### S7 Siberia Airlines customer review
We traveled from Sochi to Moscow on February 10 on S7. We were in a group of five people and a couple in our group had been bumped off of the flight with no notice. Because the staff are relatively non-English speaking there was no way to reach a level of understanding of the options except to hear there were no seats on any flights that day. Three of the five of us left on our scheduled flight only to find at least four empty seats on the flight that was supposedly full and from which our travel companions had been bumped. I tried to talk to the flight attendant who could not have been more rude about our travel companions waiting in the airport but she offered no help. There was no effort by S7 to accommodate any disruption.

### S7 Siberia Airlines customer review
HKG-IKT-HKG. Quite satisfied with S7 service: on time new planes attentive stewardesses. Food is OK. Miles can be earned for Oneworld. Another advantage is that the airlines connect in places that other airlines don't. Would fly with S7 again.

### S7 Siberia Airlines customer review
Vladivostok-Petropavlovsk Kamchatsky-Vladivostok-Novosibirsk-Moscow Domodedovo-Volgograd and Moscow Domodedovo to Munich in Business class except for the shorter segment DME-VOG. All flights in modern aircraft A319 A320 and B737-800. All but one were on time. In general crew were attentive and professional and service in Business class very good. Food was good and plentiful with full salads and starters and at least 3 choices of main dishes even on shorter segments. Limited choices of drinks no printed menus or wines list but a complete amenities kit handled even on shorter segments which was a nice touch. Comfortable leather seats and cozy cabin appropriate for shorter flights but need some improvement (footrests flats seats) for segments of 4.5 hours or more. Baggage was always delivered promptly and I was very satisfied with the whole experience. Would fly S7 Siberia Airlines anytime without hesitation.

### S7 Siberia Airlines customer review
Just been back from the trip from Sydney via Abu Dhabi to Moscow and return. S7 flight was combines with Etihad. Both companies co-operated very well during the entire trip - very easy process from buying the tickets to changing the return date at the shortest notice. Staff was very supportive and knowledgeable. Not a single drama with S7. I was very pleasantly surprised and will recommend using them. Will definitely buy tickets through them for my next trip to Russia.

Internal Russian flight UFA-DME. Flight on-time everything without a hitch. A319 was clean and clearly well maintained. Service was okay no IFE screens or movies.

DME-KJA with IKT-DME return - business class. Used British Airways Avios points to get business class to Siberia and back. Outbound flight left late due to connecting passengers. Return flight on-time. Service prompt and professional and food much better than I expected. FA in both directions spoke reasonable English and even smiled. No IFE but that is not very important to me.

We booked via BA Flying from Glasgow to LHR to Moscow and on to UFA. Food and facilities were good although the BA snack was a bit miserable en route to LHR. Return trip DME from UFA was great. The UFA check-in girl was very helpful and patient while we distributed weight. She assured us luggage would be transferred to Glasgow and every piece arrived intact.

DME-KAL. When we tried to check-in with the Self/Help service it didn't work and we were sent to another counter where we were told we missed our flight. As a regular flyer I have never encountered such unfriendly staff. They didn't care and sent us from one place to another. After almost 2 hours we were told that we were late and that they don't wait. No next flight refund or discount. We were stranded and eventually bought tickets through another airline for the next day. While we were waiting at the airport we went back to the help desk and they were again unfriendly unhelpful and just shrugged their shoulders. We were very disappointed with their service.

DME-FRA. Check-in staff very un-friendly not even a smile. Onboard the hostesses spoke good English and were friendly and courteous. Entertainment was not available. Food was on the poor side and announcements were terrible! At DME all aircraft's appeared to be located at aprons away from the main terminal buildings so you have to squeeze on a bus that takes you to the aircraft.

Beijing to Irkutsk and from to Moscow - apart from problems with visas the airport service was good. Service on the plane was appalling - for almost 7 hours on the plane we didn't notice single smile on staff faces - rude and not very helpful like they work there as a punishment. Portions of food was ridiculous and boxes like happy meal at McDonald's. We had also a lots of problems to book tickets on internet being in Irkutsk at the airport. System didn't accept our cards even if we tried like 6 of different kind. They lost my luggage in Beijing but luckily was sent to London a week later.

DME-KBP-DME A319 both ways. The website is brilliant (Russian/English/German) and very easy to use. Prices are very competitive even if you leave booking until only a few days before you're due to travel. Help desk (freephone if in Russia) has an option to reach an English- speaking operator. Check-in at both airports very quick - staff speak English. Announcements on board (flight deck and cabin crew) were Russian and English and cabin crew I talked to spoke quite good English. Excellent in-flight magazine with most of the news announcements in English as well as Russian. As the flights were mid-afternoon there was a snack box handed out. Tea and coffee served separately. Second flight delayed about 20 minutes because of passengers turning up late (not the airline's fault).

Moscow to Vladivostok Booked easily on line and everything went beautifully after that. The prices ranged from Advance cheap "no changes" to Super flexible. I arrived with everyone else on the second lower rates. Had a day in Irkutsk arriving and leaving at uncomfortable times but a good day there. The service was not in your face and gave hot compact tasty meals. Not fussed talking English but got reasonable smiles for my troubles.

Domedovo-Chelyabinsk return. First time with S7. Online booking great although no English spoken at their ticket desk. A320 was clean old but in good condition. The captain made announcements in Russian and in English and cabin crew although friendly spoke almost no English. Senior flight attendant spoke no English at all. Food good but I advise you to take a bottle of water from Duty free with you. All magazines were in Russian. S7's hub is Domodedovo which is an advantage for your trips to Russia.

I had to cancel one sector on my forthcoming trip to Russia and requested a refund to my credit card. I had a reply to the automated email within 20 minutes enclosing a formal refund request form and stating that it would take 15-20 working days to process. I filled in the form and sent it off again getting an acknowledgment within a few minutes and reitierating the 15-20 days. Imagine my surprise when I checked my credit card today and saw the refund (in full) only 3 days after the cancellation.

I'm appalled at the way this airline operates and treats its passengers. It's truly scary. I purchased a one way ticket from Frankfurt to Moscow on a direct flight for a full price two days prior to departure. Upon arriving to the airport I noticed a small sign stating that the flight will be flown to Moscow via Kiev. When I inquired with the airline official about this change of route I was informed that the administration of the airline decided to change the route a few hours ago due to the inclement weather somewhere (didn't give me many details). Once we boarded the plane we were told that we had to wait for the cargo to be loaded. we ended up sitting on the plane for 2.5 hours prior to taking off. The flight crew couldn't provide any explanation for why we had to land in Kiev. At that point the version of inclement weather was abandoned. So we land in Kiev about five hours after our scheduled departure from Frankfurt - there we find out that the real reason for our landing in Kiev was a request by some either Russian or Ukrainian authority to pick up a cargo in Kiev and deliver it to Moscow. Loading of cargo and paperwork took another 2 hours during which the passenger had to stay on the plane and wonder what was going on. We did arrive to Moscow the next day at around 1 am (instead of scheduled 8:05pm). there were multiple passenger who missed their connection - some to destinations where flights only go a couple of times a week! We were abandoned at the airport at 1am to fend for themselves to rebook their flights and find a place to sleep that night or the next few nights until their next flight.

I often use S7 for short hops between Kiev and Moscow. They manage to serve hot dinner on such a short flight. Their planes are new and in good condition. Online purchase and check-in as well as in-town check-in in Moscow work fine. Good choice and good value for money. The only minus is that they are always 30-40 minutes behind schedule.

DME-LED-DME DME-UUD-DME. The company has the newest fleet in Russia. The crew are helpful. S7 also has the best web-site of all air companies in Russia. Buying tickets through the web & on-line check-in are great. Self-registration kiosks in the airports easy to use. Food on board is good. S7's hub is Domodedovo which is another advantage.

Domododevo-UFA economy class. A319 clean plenty of leg room cabin crew excellent and attentive hot meal provided. Web ticket sales and check in works like a charm as does their bag drop off service.

### S7 Siberia Airlines customer review
Flights are usually on Airbus aircraft which is good news for domestic flights. Have flown DME-FRA DME-LED-DME DME-KZN all in Economy and some really cheap prices. The food is good and better than Aeroflot. Kiosk check-in at DME is great as is web check-in. Service from staff onboard and in the terminal is good.

Domedovo-Chelyabinsk return. First time with S7. All fights on time on all legs. Very smart aircraft clean and comfortable. Lots of leg room in economy. Courteous staff though not much English. Food excellent.

### S7 Siberia Airlines customer review
Seating tight but expected on a low cost carrier. Departures and arrivals on time and in the case of the return to Moscow we got in a bit early. Luggage arrived on both legs. All in all a good experience.
