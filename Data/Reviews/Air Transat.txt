### "we were denied check-in!
We booked return flights from Cancun to Toronto with AirTransat well in advanced. Days prior to departure, we were unable to check in online. No check email was ever sent either (we had to go to online checking and see error code after error code before deciding we would have to talk to someone in person. Customer support had no answers either.). Upon early arrival at the airport, check-in kiosks also failed to process our information. Attempts to seek assistance were ignored by nearby attendants while the Airtransat manager sat on his phone, forcing us to wait over an hour in a baggage services line. That same manager later claimed he had called for people on our flight in the time we were in line, which was laughable since there were at least 5 groups of us who “didn’t hear him”. By the time we reached an agent, we were denied check-in, despite still having 45 minutes until scheduled departure. Shortly afterward, we received an email from Air Transat indicating that the flight had been delayed. Several other customers were similarly impacted, refused check in or baggage check. We were forced to book an alternate flight with Flair at a personal cost of $1,600 CAD, with no assistance, accommodation, or reimbursement offered.

### "claiming we were 2 minutes too late"
Not Verified |  I’m extremely disappointed with the way my wife and I were treated by Air Transat gate staff at Lisbon Airport on April 2, 2025. We arrived at the gate at 11:02 AM for our 11:20 AM flight to Toronto. I saw another passenger being let through just before us—but when we approached, the agent refused to let us board, claiming we were 2 minutes too late. The flight was delayed until 12:11 PM, but we were still told we couldn’t board, even though we were at the gate, What makes this even worse is that we later received an email from Air Transat saying the flight had been delayed until 3:18 PM which was misleading. Sometimes, yes, being a few minutes late happens  —we’re all human. But we were at the gate before the scheduled departure time, and we’ve seen other passengers allowed to board even when they were late. The gate agent’s behavior was what really made this situation so frustrating. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, she replied with, “I am the boss here.” There was no effort to listen to us. In the end, we had to purchase new tickets to return home.

### "insists that my carry-on is too big"
I had the most ridiculous experience on my way back from Portugal. We had only brought carry-ons and checked-in online, but to get our boarding passes they made us get in line and go through check-in anyway. When we get to the front a worker insists that my carry-on is too big, even though we took the same plane on the way there and there was no issue!! I tell her "this makes no sense. We flew with you guys here and it fits in the over head" so she tells me to weigh it and says it's overweight. It turns out the rules online say the weight requirements are "light enough that you can lift it without assistance". So they make me pay 76 EUROs to check it and then I find out the flight was full. I guess they were trying to make room, but instead of asking people to check their carry-on for free like normal, they wanted to ring more cash out of people who booked a flight with just carry on bags. I take 6 trips a year with the same carry on bag and have never experienced this. Will not be flying with them again.

### "insisting I check it in"
I had a highly disappointing experience with Air Transat at check-in. The agent at the counter seemed overly concerned about my carry-on bag, insisting I check it in because it was larger than the measurement line by half an inch. Her tone and attitude were rude, dismissive, and sarcastic. Another colleague joined in, showing the same lack of customer service skills. After a frustrating exchange, they finally allowed me to do a gate check-in, where I handed over my bag without further issue. I noticed many passengers with larger bags than mine, which makes me question the fairness and consistency of their enforcement.

### "deserved to be treated better"
I have travelled with Air Transat numerous times but the last three times the flights have been delayed (either travelling out or back) 3 hours plus. We were due to fly back on 2nd March from Punta Cana At 8.30 pm. We were called to the gate to board and just left there for just shy of 4 hours. We were given no information at all as to what the reason was for the delay. Air Transat staff claimed they didn’t know why either. I did received an email to say it was delayed due to operational issues and that is the only information we received at this point. We were given no drinks or anything for the whole wait. After three hours they told us the flight was cancelled and they were looking for a hotel for us. My husband was due in work the next morning so this was a huge blow to him. He was scrambling round trying to get wifi (because none of us had access to the free wifi and had to pay after two hours) so he could let his colleagues know he wouldn’t be in the next day. It was so stressful. We were then told after half an hour that the flight would be taking off after all!!! We then flew off nearly 4 hours late. All they have is on the flight was a soft drink. Not even a pack of peanuts. When we were all seated the captain apologized for the delay and said it was due to a hold up of paperwork! Words failed us… The captain then went to ask us to review the airline as it was voted best airline for 2024 - the whole plane of passengers just roared with laughter. To be left for nearly 4 hours without any information or even a drink is one of the most frustrating you can do to a customer. We deserved to be treated better. Instead of getting home around 1.30 am we got home at 6.15 am - we lost a whole nights sleep! It took the whole of last week to recover. I know things happen with flights that can’t be helped but to mess 200+ paying customers like this over “paperwork” is an utter disgrace. So this is our review! We will be avoiding Air Transat holidays in future. Never again!

### "experience disappointed me"
I recently traveled with Air Transat, and unfortunately, the experience was far from satisfactory. First of all, our flight was significantly delayed, without any real explanation or compensation, which complicated our organization. Once on board, comfort left something to be desired: the seats were extremely narrow, making the journey uncomfortable, especially on a long-haul flight. Meal-wise, the quality was mediocre, well below expected standards, which is all the more regrettable when you spend several hours in flight. Finally, I found that the consideration for families with children was quite average, with little special attention and a lack of flexibility to facilitate their trip. Overall, this experience disappointed me, and I will think twice before booking another flight with this company. And I won't recommend anyone to take it. J’ai récemment voyagé avec Air Transat, et malheureusement, l’expérience a été loin d’être satisfaisante. Tout d’abord, notre vol a subi un retard important, sans réelle explication ni compensation, ce qui a compliqué notre organisation. Une fois à bord, le confort laissait à désirer : les sièges étaient extrêmement étroits, rendant le voyage inconfortable, surtout sur un vol long-courrier. Côté repas, la qualité était médiocre, bien en dessous des standards attendus, ce qui est d’autant plus regrettable quand on passe plusieurs heures en vol. Enfin, j’ai trouvé que la considération pour les familles avec enfants était assez moyenne, avec peu d’attentions particulières et un manque de flexibilité pour faciliter leur voyage. Dans l’ensemble, cette expérience m’a déçu, et je réfléchirai à deux fois avant de réserver un autre vol avec cette compagnie. Et je ne recommanderai à personne de la prendre.

### "stranded us for 15+ hours"
Air Transat stranded us for 15+ hours. Our flight, originally scheduled to depart at 12:00 PM on February 16, 2025, was delayed repeatedly, with no clear explanation or resolution. As of now, it is nearly 12 hours past our scheduled departure time, and we have been informed of yet another delay, pushing our departure to 3:00 AM on February 17, 2025. The reasons for the delay have been inconsistent and vague, ranging from "operational reasons" to "technical and safety" concerns. This lack of transparency is unacceptable, especially when passengers are left stranded in the airport with no access to basic necessities. To add insult to injury, Air Transat took us back to a resort for 6 hours, only to force us back to the airport knowing full well they had no flight ready for us. Air Transat has blatantly violated the Air Passenger Protection Regulations which require airlines to provide meals, refreshments, and accommodations in the event of significant delays. Despite being legally obligated to care for passengers, Air Transat has done nothing to alleviate the suffering of those stranded. This is not just poor customer service – it’s a complete disregard for passenger rights.

### "return flights were uneventful"
Not Verified | The return flights were uneventful and on time but they had run out of onboard food purchase options except 1 breakfast sandwich for $9.49 by the time the cart reached Row 37. There were two beverage offerings on the flight to Cuba but only one on the way back. The scheduling of their flights to virtually coincide with those of Sunwing results in long lineups to get through security and inadequate space to accommodate all those waiting their turn for screening. My only other comment is related to AirTransat's relationships with the all-inclusive resorts on the cayos of the Atlantic side of Cuba. When we booked a 3 week vacation over Christmas and New Year's there was no warning that conditions following the two hurricanes in November were negatively impacting the quality of their all-inclusive offering. Never again!

### "much better than expected"
Both legs of my flight were much better than expected. The aircraft was clean and fresh. The cabin crew were pleasant and efficient. Check in was a breeze on both legs. Flights departed and arrived as scheduled. The seat was just fine for a 4 hour flight. I am a normal-sized person. I would certainly fly with them again, given the overall experience.

### "Fighting now for reimbursement"
There was a problem with the plane so they decided to put a smaller plane. Fighting now for reimbursement because I was not offered the seat or services that I had paid for which cost a lot of money when paying for two people and they were not willing to work at all. They still wanted to charge me for all my food and drinks, even though that they could not provide me with club class. Will definitely never be flying with air transit again. This was leaving from Toronto to Cayo Coco not only that one talking to the flight attendant to try to get information. They didn’t really want to help me out in anyway, or give me much information. You also do not get priority boarding like advertised. I totally understand that if there was an issue with the original plane and having to switch is out of their control, but then making the accommodations or making up for it on the return flight is the least they could do.

### "Flight attendants were very helpful"
Not Verified |   We flew from Toronto to Paris. Flight attendants were very helpful and welcoming. We especially appreciated Emerson’s help. He was great! Ground crew were great, too!

### "80 euros for a standard carry on luggage"
We know Air Transat specs for carry on baggage are ridiculous compared to industry standards and nothing besides a tiny purse fits in their metal tester but at the same time, most experienced air Transat agents don't make a fuss out of it and understand that people who travel buy regular carry on size luggage not air transat size luggage for their trips. However what we found absolutely appalling is that it is subjective from agent to agent. So on our inbound Transat flight from Canada to Europe, we checked in our carry on free of charge as well as another 7 European flights on smaller planes but we got unlucky sucked into an unexperienced agent in Paris who made us pay 80 euros for a standard carry on luggage! Its a pure roberry. Either apply rules and make everyone pay (80 % of carry on luggages don't fit in the transat mold) but don't leave it in some subjective baffoon hands.

### "going to lose my money"
I booked a flight on Air Transat for September 25, 2024. The company decided that it would no longer operate flights on that date. She decided unilaterally to change my flight date to September 27, 2024. And it is impossible for me to take this flight on September 27, 2024. I know my flight is not refundable or anything else. I purchased my ticket through my credit card company. I contacted them and asked to schedule my flight on September 23 (place available and approximately the same price. I will pay the difference). But they don't want to. I'm going to lose my flight and I'm going to lose my money. Why not give me the opportunity to fly on September 23 instead of September 27. Places available. J'ai réservé un vol sur air transat pour le 25 septembre 2024. La compagnie a décidé quel ne faisait plus de vol à cette date. Elle a décidé unilatéralement de modifié ma date de vol et de mettre le 27 septembre 2024. Et il m'est impossible de prendre ce vol le 27 septembre 2024. Je sais que mon vol n'est ni remboursable ni rien d'autre. J'ai pris mon billet par l'intermédiaire de ma cie de carte de crédit. J'ai les ai contacté et demandé de mettre mon vol le 23 septembre (place dispo et sensiblement le même prix. Je vais payer la différence). Mais bon. Ils ne veulent pas. Je vais perdre mon vol et je vais perdre mon argent. Pourquoi ne pas m'avoir donné la possibilité de voler le 23sept au lieu du 27. Places dispo.

### “money grab with terrible service”
Air Transat is probably the worst airline of them all. Absolute money grab with terrible service all around (except the Pilots - they got us there). Seats are terribly uncomfortable, they added a metal ring under the seat to limit the size of personal bags. Food is terrible and they insist on serving meals at midnight while everyone is trying to sleep. They are even playing commercials during your inboard entertainment. Moreover, they have become the master of hidden fees. First, the check baggage is not longer included as well as the carry on. All extras. Worst of all, the needed measurements to qualify as a carry-on is smaller than the rest of the industry - that way they can force you to pay to check-in your carry-on: Standard: 22 x 16 x 9 inches Air Transat: 20 x 16 x 9 inches (that way, the carry-on bag you bought for that very purpose will have to be checked-in because it doesn't fit in their metal tester (which is probably smaller that the actual measurements. Please note that the overhead bins can accomodate much bigger bags - Again, they lure you in with the cheap price, only to realise it's for the sub-economy class with nothing included. Add 120$ per person per bag - and you can basically only bring a small handbag as a carry on. At least Ryan Air is honest about being a budget airline - Air Transat should drop the pretence that they are good airline.

### “3 out of 4 have had cancellations”
If you are thinking of flying from Europe to Canada, I would not recommend AirTransat. I flew from Barcelona to Calgary via Toronto. A month before the airline changed the initial connection from Montreal to Calgary. It scheduled my flight to arrive even later to my destination. When I arrived in Toronto, I had a layover of 5 hours and then my connecting flight to Calgary was CANCELLED. Nobody contacted me. Can you imagine the situation after having flown for nine hours and a layover of 5 hours? I spent the night at the airport and in the morning I try to contact the airline, (paying extra money to my phone company), but they were helpless on the phone saying that I had to contact the company which operated for them (PORTER). I filed a complaint for AirTransat without any answer 10 days so far... AFTER THREE DAYS my flight had been cancelled I received a message from Porter rescheduling my flight.... THE NIGHTMARE CONTINUED with my returning flight: I received a modification of my returning flights. Curiously enough, my flight from Calgary to Toronto had disappeared!!! And my flight now from Toronto to Barcelona had been delayed one day later! In the message AirTrans wrote that if I didn't accept this modification, I could ask for a refund filling a form. I try to fill that form and (surprise!) I couldn't! It said that I couldn't filling it because it was less than 24 hours before my leaving! (It's 31 July and the flight is on 6 Aug!!). I can understand that sometimes there are problems with flights, but this time it has been a record: 3 out of 4 have had cancellations and delays. Besides, the most important thing is to receive some kind of support or help from the company you paid for the tickets. Nothing of that I have received from Air Transat. I have had to pay more than $2,000 dollars in advance for their incompetent professionalism. Can you imagine this happening to you flying with children?

### "the worst transcontinental flight"
Probably the worst transcontinental flight of our lives. The main reason for this was the seats. They were uncomfortable from the first moment we sat down. No amount of squirming or readjusting could help this. This Airbus was configured with 9 seats across instead of the standard 8. The legroom was good, the backrest acceptable but the seat itself was an abominable thing. The food was also a big disappointment, lacking in taste and quantity. They served drinks but water bottles were $3.99 each. No blankets and no pillows were provided but they sold them. The kicker is that this flight wasn’t cheaper than competitors! The entertainment options were also substandard in our estimation. Many decades old movie favorites and few newer releases. We found the selection to be limited and uninspired. The screen itself was good quality. In the end, our opinion is that Air Transat took every available opportunity to choose profit over comfort. We’ve flown the same route with BA, Air Canada, Lufthansa, and Air France. They all have pros and cons but they are all much better than our Air Transat experience for roughly the same price. And I must add the cabin crew weren’t that great either.

### “Simply the worst experience”
Simply the worst experience I have ever had. I was on time from a code share partner from fll. Porter. They were late but I still had 60 minutes before the flight. I actually had 2:30 hours because Porter later told me the Transat flight was actually delayed. Porter checked my bags through but for some reason could not print the boarding passes. So I had to go to check in just to get them a a two minute walk to the gate. I met the most rude and unpleasant woman on the 28th of June at 11pm. I had a 4 year old and 12 year old traveling with me. She made no effort, I have no idea why even the Porter representative tried to talk to her, this is a woman who is a control freak. Rude and disrespectful unhelpful - her colleagues were scared to say anything initially did try to help but were intimidated by this person with an attitude. I got no help of where to stay how to get my checked bags over two hours later and only because Porter sent someone to get them. It was after 2am when I got to a hotel with my 4 and 12 year old. So I can’t comment on the plane or trip itself.

### "At 60 days no response"
Was not given seats I paid $300 extra for. Was charged $84US more than the posted price on their website by agent at hotel. Was lied to by agent at airport who promised excursions were taking CN $ at par with US. Filed 2 claims for reimbursement as instructed. Told wait 30 days. At 30 days told wait 60 days. At 60 days no response.

### "made me check my carry on"
Not Verified |   I had a carry on that fit in the bin they make you try and she still made me check my carry on when I told her I had my breathing machine on it. She said there was no overhead space. Very frustrating but as I boarded the plane there was ample overhead bin space. t Very annoying frustrating and disappointing experience.

### "very disappointing experience"
I recently had a very disappointing experience with Air Transat that I feel compelled to share. We were the only passengers who voluntarily checked in two of our bags at the gate to help with the cabin space issue, expecting a smoother journey. However, when it came to our third bag, they had no space left and placed it in row 33, while we were seated in row 22. This meant that after landing, we had to wait until the entire plane was empty to retrieve our baggage. Traveling with a tired three-year-old, we asked the stewardess if there could be a different solution, but she made no effort to accommodate our needs. Her lack of concern and unwillingness to assist was incredibly frustrating. To make matters worse, after landing, as we were disembarking, one stewardess kindly asked our son if he wanted to see the cockpit. Naturally, he was excited and said yes. However, immediately after, another stewardess abruptly told us he couldn’t see it, leaving our son in tears. This experience was truly terrible from start to finish. The lack of empathy and poor service we received from Air Transat was unacceptable.

### "ruined 2 days of my vacation"
The story began that the plane arrived late to FLL. We finally set in the plane an hour later, and the captain announced that connecting flight in Montreal to Barcelona will be waiting for us, there were about 10-15 ppl for that flight, so we were not worrying to be late, as the plane departed 2 hours late as scheduled. It was the same airline and the ticket purchased as a single ticket and after the captain’s announcement there was not even any thought that there will be any problem. When we landed in Montreal, an agent called these who are for connecting flight to weigh right by the entrance, not allowing to proceed to the departure gates. He said that the plane to Barcelona had already departed. But we learned that the plane was still at the gate. When we asked the agent, he said, well, the authority decision was to rebook all of us for the next day’s flight. Apparently, the flight was oversold, and that was the easiest decision not paying us compensation for that. The agent provided us with the hotel info, and first thing I asked if the hotel is booked for 1 night and we have check out the next day by noon. The flight was almost at midnight, and the 10 hours gap we would have no place to stay at. But the agent assured us that we don’t have to checkout by noon, it is taken care of, and we can stay at the hotel till the evening. But this was a lie, the hotel was booked just for 1 night and checkout at 11. I called an airline from the hotel, to get more info on the hotel and on reimbursement but no one responded even though it was the line for an immediate assistant. With all that said, there were no other conditions but the airline’s negligence and irresponsibility. All this ruined 2 days of my vacation, luck of sleep, stress make me ill, and the financial loss of the hotel booked in Barcelona

### "airline ruined my trip"
The customer service for the airline is an absolute joke. Ruined my whole vacation. Got to Cancún airport to wait 2 hours for our shuttle that was never coming. Not one of the air transat reps bothered to tell us. I had to ask to find out. Had to pay a taxi driver $120 usd to take me to the resort. I was assured that I would be refunded at the resort. At the resort the Air Transat rep wasted 3 of my mornings giving me the run around. Come back tomorrow my supervisor isn’t in” etc. Only to find out we would have to submit a claim online which I still haven't heard back from. Would have been nice if she told me the first time I saw her. This airline ruined my trip. I will never fly with them again nor do I recommend anyone else. Absolute joke.

### "not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |   The plane was delayed for almost 2 hours so we were on plane approx 6 hours. Only passed with drinks once and was told no sandwiches on this flight only pringles, gummy bears etc.S eats very uncomfortable. Would not recommend this airline.

### "demanded the blind be closed"
We booked a daytime flight and asked for a window seat because my fiance needs to be able to look out of the window as she's a very nervous flier. The extremely aggressive air hostess demanded the blind be closed as soon as we took off for the duration of the 8 hour daytime flight. She then called my fiance a 'minority' and suggested that meant she had no rights to have her blind open. We are horrified by this.

### “we have yet to hear anything back”
Not Verified | Absolutely the worst agency I've ever come across. They gouged us for prices, lied about what to expect at the resort, then when we tried to complain, there was no one to talk to. They have no phone line for customer service complaints for past trips, only a link to a form to fill out. It has been 4 months, with many follow ups, and we have yet to hear anything back. I tried contacting them through their FB messenger chat and was given no answer except "they will contact you via email as soon as possible". Never using this horrible airline again.

### "don't care about their customers"
I booked a flight from Toronto to Cayo Coco with this company and when the payment went thru the departure and arrival of the flight was scheduled in Montreal which is about 10 hours drive from where i am. I called them to change it and they left me wait on the phone for hours giving me excuses and at the end after all the time i waited they told me that I'd have to pay off my own pocket for a trip to Montreal. This company don't care about their customers.

### “flight crew were friendly and efficient”
Not Verified | Very pleased with the my direct flight from Glasgow to Toronto in November 2023. I had to make a round trip at very short notice and I found Air Transat, although the online reviews were a bit “scary”. The online booking went smoothly and the mid-week, outward and return flights left on time and arrived on time. Good work guys. The check in teams at Glasgow and Toronto were friendly and helpful. The flight crew were friendly and efficient, probably helped by the fact that the flights were around half full. My checked baggage was retrieved quite quickly on both occasions. The seating and catering was reasonable for economy class and in my experience better than expected from many of the harsh reviews. Perhaps I had beginners luck! I will be using them again. Keep up the good work.

### "love Air Transat service"
Not Verified |  I always fly Air Transat, been to Spain two times, Portugal, Rome, been going to Cuba for 20 years. Been with a few other airlines. I love Air Transat service I always fly club class the price is reasonable and worth the price. I Am trying Costa Rica for the first time this year.

### "the most uncomfortable seats"
Not Verified |  We paid for extra legroom seats for all three travellers and had booked two tickets first then an extra seat later, I had called to ensure we were all seated together in the extra legroom seats we paid for. When we got on the flight home we had been separate from my grandmother despite having had the seats agreed and nobody telling us we had been changed, we also were not changed for a like for like seat (still extra legroom but from window to aisle). We eventually are able to get them to move us back together. These are by far the most uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in. It was more uncomfortable than their standard seats and is totally unacceptable that people pay money for those seats when they are so uncomfortable. I was incredibly disappointed with my service with air Transat and do not plan to use them again which is a shame because they used to be an excellent alternate to flying from Heathrow or using Air Canada.

### "short of my expectations"
I would like to express my deep dissatisfaction with the way Transat has handled my claim. To date, two months have passed since my trip, and I have not received any updates or resolutions to my issue. The customer service I have experienced so far falls far short of my expectations. My goal is to draw attention to the issues we have encountered while hoping to encourage a significant improvement in their abysmal service. I also want to emphasize that their customer service is non-existent by phone, and reaching them is impossible. I wish good luck to anyone who may face issues with Transat. | Je souhaite partager ma profonde insatisfaction quant au suivi de ma réclamation avec Transat. À ce jour, deux mois se sont écoulés depuis mon voyage, et je n'ai reçu aucune nouvelle ni résolution de mon problème. Le service à la clientèle que j'ai expérimenté jusqu'à présent est loin de répondre à mes attentes. Mon objectif est d'attirer l'attention sur les problèmes que nous avons rencontrés, tout en espérant encourager une amélioration significative de leur service pourri. Je tiens aussi à souligner que le service à la clientèle est inexistant par téléphone, et il est impossible de les joindre. Je souhaite bonne chance à toutes celles et ceux qui pourraient rencontrer des problèmes avec Transat.

### "The airline is dysfunctional"
Not Verified |  The airline is dysfunctional, from check in to on board and deplaning. Their lack of knowledge is baffling and their customer service and experience is so poor 0 stars would not do it justice. Our reservation was not honored (purchased extra leg room for ease of maneuvering and comfort while traveling with our infant) that only 1 of the 3 passengers who purchased these accommodations were given. In flight crew was not only rude, we felt discriminated against due to traveling with an infant. When deplaning in Montreal we were told by 6 different inflight and ground crew members that our stroller would be moving along with us to Toronto and would not be at the gate but would be with the oversized luggage if not at the gate when landing at our final destination in Toronto. Needless to say this was not the case, and over 2 months since returning from our trip we still do not have any information on this stroller. When contacting the airline for hours and days they were no help and continued to give us a run around with no solutions offered. I took the step of sending a message to the CEO via LinkedIn in the hopes of making progress. This too proved to be underwhelming as they passed me off to another representative (which I understand and expected) who still has provided no solutions and empty promises. We were assured that we would be refunded for the additional cost of thee extra leg room seats that were not honored, but 3 weeks later still nothing from the airline, and multiple correspondence have been ignored. We took the step to purchase a new stroller ($430 USD) to replace the same one we originally traveled with with the promise of reimbursement which has been an even bigger struggle to recoup. Again my family has flown this airline for the last 20 years with no issue for their annual trip to Greece to visit family and friends. This will no longer be an airline we support and I will go out of my way to discourage anyone I come in contact with from choosing them.

### "could not print me a boarding pass
If you book a codeshare flight, there is no way to checkin or manage your flight online. No allergen free meal was offered as part of booking. Seats are narrow. My connection was with their codeshare partner, Porter. When I checked in at the airport, Porter could not print me a boarding pass. I arrived in Toronto and no Air Transat employee could print me a boarding pass airside. This meant I could not access the lounge of which I am a member. When an Air Transat staff member finally arrived at my gate, she could not assign me a seat and printed me a standby ticket. I would be happy to purchase an aisle seat on a discount airline, but since there is no way to manage your flight online this wasn't even an option.

### "his dedication and hard work"
We are very grateful and thankful to all the employees. These employees are exceptionally amazing friendly and helpful. One employee stands out is Air Transat handicap aid Mario Ho. Please recognize and acknowledge his dedication and hard work for your company. Air Transat is such a wonderful company!

### "dissatisfied and disappointed"
Sadly I do not recommend this airline that boasts itself as being voted best leisure airline of the year by SKYTRAX! As I have flown this route before a few years ago and again this March down south to Mexico their quality of service has downgraded a lot! The staff is unhappy or so or seems the on board service is that which resembles carriers like Frontier and Spirit. They no longer offer the option of pre ordering a gourmet meal since the food for this route is minuscule and awful! The seats are uncomfortable and the aisles are so narrow I don’t know how their flight attendants can get through especially in an emergency. The only thing going for them is the monopoly of a direct flight from Montreal to Athens alongside Air Canada. The language fluency in French was horrendous as the head flight attendants struggled both in French and especially Greek like they were reading off cue cards. Canada is a bilingual country and therefore the staff on board should be bilingual at the least. There were flight attendants on both flights that spoke no French. Sadly they have a lot of work to do on their image, concept and staff satisfaction. By the way the ticket we paid for was not cheap and had no flexibility. I am dissatisfied and disappointed and would prefer to fly a different airline on our next trip!

### "All in all never again"
Our Air Transat service (with its own logos on the aircraft) was operated by SmartLynx Airlines. This was our return flight home. Gone was the inflight entertainment system, charging sockets, individual air conditioning and with it any personal space and comfort we enjoyed with the same airline (Air Transat) a week earlier. I'm 5'2, felt claustrophobic and couldn't even turn in my seat. My partner is 6'1 - his knees were practically up behind his ears. Staff were generally uninterested. Loud pop music was playing through the speakers when we were boarding and remained on for almost an hour until we started taxiing (and enough people complained), then as soon as the fasten seatbelt signs went out, all lights were swiftly dimmed leaving people to scramble for their essentials in the dark. 2 hours later (midnight at the point of departure) lights went on again just as people had started nodding off and they started serving dinner (which everyone presumably already had as it was an 11pm flight) after this lights went off again. The young children and babies on board had become confused by all the fuss and started loudly crying which continued for over an hour. 2 hours before landing staff started handing out breakfast rolls which ran out before they even got to our row. No apology or explanation was given. (Not that we were in any state to eat.) We had issues checking in for both the outbound and inbound flight, which is unusual and caused unnecessary stress and inconvenience. The Air Transat website is near unusable. The app is OK. Check-in staff will attempt to scam you out of money over issues at their own end. All in all never again.

### "Horrible seats"
Horrible seats. too small. Struggled all the way even after buying XL seats for 300 CAD $ Never will use again. space for foot was ok but buttocks of my spouse did not fit at all to seats.

### "Terrible service"
Not Verified |  This aircraft doesn't have any charging ports for personal devices, and it has no screens for entertainment. Terrible service, even the discount airlines are better.

### "very disappointing experience"
Not Verified |  We booked club class in order to ensure a good overnight travel on our return and have access to lounges on both legs. The overall experience with air transat was less than satisfactory and with the difference in price between economy and club flex we expected a better service. The aircraft are old, seats in business do not fully recline and the food and service are mediocre. You get a flimsy blanket, no cushion. So really not up to business class standards. Access to business lounges is inexistent. In Rome no agreements with any of the lounges and in Montreal, could access a lounge by paying extra which is not in line with what air transat announces on its website. To note that staff at check in were probably instructed to remain vague on lounge access as we were not informed that no access was available but were pointed instead to lounges who turned us away with contempt. A very disappointing experience not to be repeated.

### "I’ve spent hours on the phone"
Not Verified |  I am not travelling until March 2024, but just booking has been a nightmare. I’ve had to call numerous times as the tickets keep being issued incorrectly. I’ve spent hours on the phone. To date, I’ve had to call 6 times! No one seems to be accountable and zero customer service.

### "my lay flat seat was broken"
On overnight flight to Rome, my lay flat seat was broken and charging station was not working. Flight attendants were very helpful but when contacted Air Transat for a refund on the club class fee they said end of story. No attempt at any accommodations made. Avoid using them.

### "lost the cost of this flight"
Following an issue at the airport with not having an ETA I was rejected from flying and has lost the cost of this flight due to lack of kindness and patience in the process, as well as a lack of fair guidance and fair policies to support the passenger journey. The flight was delayed and there could have been a few more minutes of flexibility to get me onto the flight. For the staff it was a simple no, for me it was lost time, money as well as business. Staff members didn’t consider that it does take time sometimes to get to the airport and mistakes happen.

### "a horrible experience with Transat"
Not Verified |  We had a horrible experience with Transat (flight TS2513 Samana-Toronto) on August 10, 2023. The crew was extremely rude and aggressive and allowed themselves to scream at passengers. Their attitude was below allowed limit and showed lack of professionalism.

### "airline has yet to refund us"
My wife and I were looking for a good deal to get us to Barcelona for our Honeymoon (which was a Mediterranean Cruise). Air Transat was one of the more affordable options, and the times worked the best for us, so we decided to give them a shot. Those compliments are the last that I can give this airline. The trip originated in Miami, with a scheduled 3 hour layover in Montreal. Due to “aircraft maintenance issues”, we were 2 1/2 hours delayed leaving Miami, which made our connection paper thin in Montreal. We politely mentioned our concern about making the next flight, along with our baggage being transferred to the flight from Montreal to Barcelona. The flight attendant told us not to worry, as their were 27 others making the same connection and that not only would the next flight wait for us, but that our luggage would 100% make the next flight because the planes would be one gate away from each other. Once we landed in Montreal, a gate agent was waiting for us and the aforementioned 27 others who were to catch next flight for Barcelona. Once all 29 got off the plane, the gate agent unexpectedly informed us that we would all need to go all the way back to the entrance of the airport to go through customs as the quick transfer customs office was closed. So 29 Americans were heavily encouraged to sprint through the airport. Two elderly couples could not keep up, and no one knew if they made it to customs or not. Finally after a nearly 10-15 min run we made it it to Canadian customs and then sprinted back to the gate of next flight. We asked flight attendants on the next flight if our bags would make it. She said “oh yes, the captain is seeing to it that all of the luggage from the flight that just came is being put on this flight”. Once we arrived in Barcelona, we  discovered that no bags of the connecting passengers made it. We were  forced to wait in a long line at lost baggage. Finally, Barcelona officials were able to process our lost baggage claims and gave us proper documentation. After we spoke with Air Transat, they promised us that they would have our luggage to us by the time we arrived in Cannes, (the second port of our Med Cruise). However, the bags did not arrive until the 5th day. We were forced to pay an exorbitant delivery fee to the airport officials as they said that Air Transat did not pay for the delivery service typically required by airlines. During the time that we did not have our bags, Air Transat told us to purchase any clothing and toiletries that we needed up to $800 US dollars, and they would reimburse us for the costs. As of August 11, it’s been over 2 months, and the airline has yet to refund us.

### "could not care about my situation"
I called Air Transat to book two flights for my son and husband. The agent was friendly but made the mistake to charged me in euros but Canadian dollars. When I checked my account, I was charged extra so I called again to get the correct, so the cancel the reservations and rebook them. This was on a Sunday, I called back on Thursday because they charges still there and not refund. They told me that the didn’t do the refund correctly and that now it would take five to ten business days when I need my money back. It was close to $4,000 CAD. It is unfair that the air line made the mistakes and the customer has to paid for and deal with the consequences. The agent could not care about my situation or even un knowledge it.

### "Horrible customer service"
Not Verified | Horrible. Luggage lost for days. Still no luggage. Boarding a cruise in less than 24 hours without important items. Horrible customer service. Paid $11 for earbuds that barely worked. Food was disgusting, seats were uncomfortable. I will never be traveling with air transit again.

### "customer service is very poor and slow"
Not only we had major delays, I paid for seat selection on return flights, the changed the air plane and did not provide me with the seats I selected on the website. Their customer service is very poor and slow, they hang up on people who call before even saying Hello. Trays were dirty, I has to ask them to clean it.

### "absolutely horrible experience"
Had an absolutely horrible experience with a trip booked through the Air Transat website, with a connecting flight operated by Porter. Total fail by both companies! When showing up for initial flight operated by Air Transat, was refused boarding and handed a phone number to try to fix it. After about a half hour on hold and speaking to heavily accented employee, found that they’d changed my booking to several days later. No emails, no notice whatsoever, no offers of compensation, nothing. If that wasn’t bad enough, when I eventually took the flight they rebooked me on, upon arrival at ticketing for the second leg of my trip (this time operated by Porter), I was again refused boarding. This time they said I owed them a large sum of money (about one and a half times the total price of the flights I’d booked) and would not be allowed to board until it was paid. Upon contacting both Air Transat and Porter (both at ticketing and through their phone line), both claimed it was the other’s fault, they could do nothing, and I would have to work it out with the other airline. Ended up missing the flight trying to work it out and spent the night in the airport. After hours of dealing with both airlines, I eventually succumbed to the extortion because even that was still less expensive than a last-second flight. Never felt so dirty and beaten at the whole affair. Thus far complaints after the fact have only resulted in being ignored totally (Porter) and told it was the other airline’s fault (Air Transat).

### "The worst part was the food"
Not Verified |  I flew home from Rome to Toronto an almost 10hr flight. First we were given separated seats (traveling as a couple) the check in attendant was rude and kept us waiting for 20 minutes didn't even mention that the seats weren't together. The flight was delayed for 18 minutes, no communication. The worst part was the food, it looked like left over boiled chicken with some nasty sauce and soggy tasteless veggies. Best part was the friendly air hostess and the smoothest landing.

### "Worst experience I’ve ever had"
Abysmal customer service! While the flight and onboard service were fine, the customer service is shambolic. During transit, they lost my backpack. There was no one at the counter to speak to, so you had to call their emergency line (together with a dozen other passengers). During the call they verified my details, where they made a typo which resulted in me missing their emails regarding my bag. They only found out once I contacted them about whether they had found my bag. They said they were not able to reach me, even after confirming my details 3 times. Then they said it would be at the Montreal airport and they would contact me to send it to Ottawa (I was travelling across the country). By the time I had left Ottawa in contacted them again regarding the status of this case. They said they sent it to Toronto. That was my next destination, so I asked if they could leave it there so I can pick it up. I went to Toronto airport and the bag was nowhere to be found. Contacted them again and they said it was in Montreal. None of the customer service agents was able to answer my question and I kept having to repeat the case to every single on of them. They told me to contact the lost baggage department (only via email), but they did not respond. After two weeks of persistent calling, I received my luggage. In the meantime I had to buy a new bag and clothes etc to be able to travel. According to the lady on the phone, I could just file a complaint and attach the receipts so I would get compensation for the incurred costs. So I did. Never heard anything back from them. I made the request 3 times, because there may have gone something wrong. Until today, I haven’t heard anything from Air Transat! This has cost me an extra few hundred dollars, which they said they would repay me. All in all the customer service was completely incapable (except for the man (I believe his name was Mike)) who was able to deliver my luggage. Very hard to reach them in the first place and especially once you’re back home. Don’t keep their promises and simply lied about repaying the damages. Worst experience I’ve ever had.

### "Unable to manage booking"
It was a pleasant flight going to and coming back from London. I recently flew on Air Transat for an international flight to London and they partnered with Porter Airlines for the domestic route within Canada. Unable to manage booking online because of share code; Not clear about luggage allowance; hence, I learned that my booking did not include any checked-in luggage and had to pay at the airport going to and returning from London; Blankets are for sale if you need one; Food and beverages are complementary but are just okay; bland – no pepper or salt; Cellphone charger are found beneath the seats and will need an adapter (no direct USB port); The ground service in London is much friendlier than in Canada. Never again!

### "worst airline I’ve flown"
Absolutely the worst airline I’ve flown. They will delay you, give you one meal for an 8+ hour flight, incredibly uncomfortable seats and charge $11 for a blanket. We were given dinner and our breakfast was a slice of banana bread. On the flight back home we were also in the worst terminal at Paris CDG. The price of this flight was not even remotely affordable.

### "they have changed our selected seats"
Not Verified |  We paid for eco plus despite having the basic economy tickets and then booked my elderly grandmother separately on the expensive exit row seats to ensure she had enough room to manoeuvre. Upon boarding the plane I realise they have changed our selected seats which we paid for without telling me and so then have to speak to the stewardess about asking other people to move, they also switched my aisle seat for a middle seat which I find ridiculous. On top of that these seats we had paid a lot of extra money for were the most uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in. They are designed with a immoveable armrest that is tiny we all came off the plane with bruises on our thighs because of the tightness of the seat, the flight was genuinely painful and none of us are extremely big people so I can only imagine someone who is a bit bigger would genuinely be unable to sit in that seat for the flights duration.

### "disappointed with the service"
Not Verified |  I was disappointed with the service and seating on my recent flight. For the price paid, I expected a more comfortable experience and better customer service. I hope the airline takes this feedback into consideration for future improvements. Unless you are travelling to Europe or perhaps to an other place but truly enjoy the pain and discomfort of seats that don’t recline, do not book. P.S The staff aren't even nice.

### "Staff were friendly and very competent"
Our family was very impressed with our first flight with Air Transat. The Check-in and boarding process was smooth and efficient. Staff were friendly and very competent. The onboard experience was pleasant even though an older aircraft was utilized. We were pleased to have good legroom in economy seats for the nine hour flight. Flight attendants very friendly, efficient and attentive. The flight was delayed, but only about 15 minutes late arriving in Toronto. We most certainly will fly Air Transat again.

### "Worst flight experience"
Worst flight experience of my whole life by a huge gap. The 4 hour flight took almost 10 hours and waited more than an hour inside the plane in the airport to be assigned to a gate. I nearly lost my next flight which was supposed to have 5 hours connection time. They used buses to transfer passengers to the plane. We waited standing inside a still bus parked in front of the plane for 20 minutes and transferred back to the airplane:)) but since couldn’t go back inside the airport, they asked us to sit down on the floor. The staff didn’t bother to speak english to the passengers of an international flight to Amsterdam.

### "very rude and offered no assistance"
My initial experience with Air Transat was positive, but upon arriving in Montreal, I had to walk several miles to catch my connecting flight and stand in long lines. Because I have a learning disability and anxiety (and Air Transat does not offer assistance), I had to rely on asking Air Transat agents at the terminal for help. I eventually sat where I was advised to sit, which was to the left of the gate, where I could not hear announcements and missed my window to board. While the agents on site were very understanding, the Air Transat hotline that I was told to call offered no assistance. I was not given the option to rebook the flight. Instead, I found myself stranded at the airport for 48 hours (!) and had to pay for a brand-new ticket. I repeatedly called the customer service hotline, but agents there were very rude and offered no assistance. After 200+ flights, this is the first really bad experience I've had.

### "he helped me a lot"
Not Verified |  I want to write a review about the agent David Ngoie from AIr Transat he helped me a lot since I had to change the name on the flight i booked to match my daughter's passport, I tried with the third party I booked with Flight Hub and they wanted to charge me a big amount to do that even though this was only the next day to my booking, I called Air transat and the first agent i spoke with didn't even want to check and told me flight hub has to do it. I called again and David answered and took the time to review my reservation and was able to do the change and sent me confirmation with no fee or any complications. Thank you so much David

### "they go above and beyond"
Not Verified |  This is a review for the customer service. I booked the most bargain bucket eco-budget ticket and then realised I made a mistake on my booking - worth over 1000 USD. Even though they had no obligation to refund me, they did - every penny. Took some time because they had to get approval from the accounts side, etc, but just showed how much they go above and beyond. Air Transat - thank you!

### "never fly with Transat again"
Not Verified |  If you have a other option take it. Flight was delayed 3 times before they told us it was cancelled and rescheduled for the following day due to weather  it was sunny when they cancelled our flight) then the flight that was scheduled after ours went out. There was no compensation given, so no hotel room no food vouchers and no compensation for a lost night at the resort. We paid for seat selection and weren’t seated where we paid for and just told to call our travel agents. I will never fly with Transat again. They completely ruined our trip. On our flight home they didn’t restock the plane so we were left with whatever food was leftover from the flight before ours so we got old stale pizza.

### "onboard service was perfect"
The airline and onboard service was perfect. My issue is with the resort commute service only: I was left in resort with my partner just because of having 3 minutes delay in coming to lobby! Not even 5 min they wait, and I had to pay $60 to taxi to airport in Porto Plata. I complained about it and person in charge, provided some nonsense instead of giving a convincing response. Not happy with the service there.

### "were awesome in service"
Suzanne and her associates were awesome in service. There was a unruly and abusive traveller sitting near me and they made sure he didn't hurt anyone and tried their best to ensure he was amicable as possible. The traveller should not have been travelling alone. Suzanne continually ensured I was ok and appreciated that I had to deal with this person for a long flight.

### "seamless and pleasant"
Our flights with Air Transat are seamless and pleasant. We traveled to Cuba this year after 3 years of Covid. The staff were so helpful and accommodating. We came home on Valentine's Day and our grandson gave Valentine's cards to the flight attendants and was allowed to give the Captain the same once the plane arrived in Toronto. Our luggage arrived in Cuba without issue and also back home to Toronto. I can't even express enough what a pleasant experience we had. Air Transat will be our go to airline when traveling.

### "our flights were flawless"
Not Verified |  At a time when airlines are getting lots of bad press, what a nice surprise it was flying with Air Transat. Both our flights to Punta Cana and home were flawless. We will definitely use Transat again.

### "most enjoyable flight"
Not Verified | We flew with Air Transat on January 1 2023 from Toronto to Puerto Plata on TS 844 and returned on January 8 2023 on flight TS 845. A most enjoyable flight and excellent flight crew in both directions. They made our air travel very comfortable and relaxing. We would recommend Air Transat to anyone flying to use .

### "staff in Toronto was absolutely tremendous"
Not Verified |  The Air Transat staff in Toronto was absolutely tremendous helping with a mix-up of golf bags upon our return from Punta Cana. I mistakenly took the wrong bag and the Staff did everything possible to ensure the bag i had taken got returned to it's rightful owner and that I received my bag promptly and with the utmost care. Thank you to the Air Transat Toronto Staff. You are terrific.

### "Air Transat has never let me down"
Another great flight with Air Transat! I prefer this airline than any of the other charter airlines out of Toronto Pearson. Flew club class. Service excellent start to finish, friendly staff. Nice meal and snacks. Amenity kits, comfortable big seats, big screens. Content is a bit dated but something to entertain. Flight left on time, arrived early. Onboarding quick. Exiting the plane was quick and efficient. Bags arrived and were off the plane fast. Air Transat has never let me down.

### "wouldn’t even wish that on my enemies"
What Air Transat did to me, I wouldn’t even wish that on my enemies. I was supposed to fly to Manchester on December 24 2022 for departure at 9 50 pm but my issues started with them at 5 50 pm. When they were checking me in, the whole process was sketchy where they were piling suit cases for all destinations in one area. I said how will you even find the correct luggage. Was told sir do not worry about it. Moving on, checked in all was fine when at 9 50 pm passengers were told the incoming flight from Montreal is delayed and we’ll take off at 11 30. Post midnight we finally boarded and now announcements started one after the other by the captain that were still waiting for luggage to arrive. Long story short 3 hours later , luggage still didn’t arrive and the crews time had expired, and now they couldn’t fly anymore. At 3 30 am, we were told to disembark with a departure time of 8 20 am provided. I decided to wait and at 815 am, we were told that the crew has not arrived yet and we will be taking off at 10 am. Now, We were told that the crew is on its way but somehow in the middle, the crew got lost and the pilot never showed up for the time specified. Maybe between the time he left his house to the airport, he called in sick. So what now ? Departure is at 9 50 pm at night of the following day. At this point I said give me back my luggage and I’m happy to leave. They’re like we need time locating it and the staff escorted me out to a domestic arrival area where easily 1000 bags were piled and I was now on my own to look for it. 2 hours of searching I somehow located my bag and called it a day on the worst Christmas ever! (It took me 18 hours to get out of there) I hope I can call tomorrow and get a refund! I’m sure that is going be another nightmare. This Is a combination of poor airline decisions combined with the worst airport crew in the history of North America. On top of it all, they gave out $15 meal vouchers when everything at Pearson is 20 dollars and up.

### "I will never fly with them again"
I’ve traveled with this airline on a roundtrip from Madrid to Montreal and all I can say is I will never fly with them again. They lost my luggage on a direct flight! They advised me to check my handbag at the check in point saying that the airplane was full and that I may have to check it in anyway at the boarding gate. So I followed their advice and I arrived to Montreal and they had lost my luggage. My bag arrived to Madrid 9 days later, and it hand a grip broken and my toiletries bag had been stolen. What’s even worse, the airline is bound to reimburse you for the expenses you incur while you are without luggage. Their policy states they will reimburse you up to 50 CAD/day for each day you don’t have your luggage with you. Well guess what after more than 2 months of claiming less than 300 CAD for the expenses I had during my trip without my personal belonging, I haven’t heard a word back from them. I’ve reached out to them like 5 times in the past 2 months and they are simply ignoring me. So at this point I assume they will simply not reimburse me any of the expenses. If you fly with this airline, expect your luggage to be lost, even on direct flights, and don’t expect any compensation for the trouble they caused you. Never again!

### "Customer service is a joke"
Not Verified | Customer service is a joke with these guys. Only two ways you can contact by phone and by Facebook chat and none of them working properly. I was on phone with automated service and music on hold for more than 2 hours. On chat more than 2 hours and none of the agent shows up. So, their false information about availability 24/7 is a just joke.

### "it was a comfortable flight"
I have flown with this airline several times from Canada to destinations south and in Europe. I have never had any issues flying with them. As they are often the cheaper option when it comes to travel, I can get to where I want to go with ease and know i am getting great service for the price i pay. I never had an issue with their customer service as I typically am a well-prepared traveler, and know what to expect. But when I'm in the airport the staff was helpful in using the self-luggage check-in. They were quick and helped me through the process and i was quickly through Security. Boarding is always ease, and they are there to help you find your seat quickly. While like some airlines they do not provide a blanket and pillow, i did pay for Options plus, which gave me a comfort kit. I do recommend price matching with the Options plus and eco standard as sometimes it could be cheaper. As well, I suggest bringing a blanket on board for comfort and warmth. The food is typical airplane food, nothing special about it. Overall it was a comfortable flight and quick to arrive at my destination.

### "Never again Air Transat"
I rarely post reviews about anything but this one tops one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had. Within 5 minutes of boarding the flight, the passenger in front of me attempts to recline her seat so far back she bangs it against my knees. She continues doing so over and over again and of course cannot recline because my knees are in the way ( no fault of my own) She proceeds to call the stewardess and tell her that her seat isn’t reclining. The stewardess addresses me and starts explaining that it is the passengers right to recline her chair. I explain that while I understand that it is her right, I cannot do anything about my legs being there, I simply cannot move my legs!! The stewardess and the passenger both gang up on me and the stewardess continues with the same speech that the passenger has every right to recline. At this point I am frustrating and keep explain the same thing! I have no space!!! The stewardess then engages a random passenger in the same row who is completely unrelated to this situation and says “Do you not agree that it is her right to recline her seat?! ?” At this point I don’t engage them anymore because I know they can simply kick me off the flight if the feel like it. The passenger then changes seats and for the remainder of the flight the stewardess does not give me and my friend any service what so ever for 6.5 hours. Barry looking at us or offering to take our trash or anything if that sort. Never again Air Transat,

### "Worst flight experience"
Worst flight experience. If this is your only option, just don’t do it. Aircraft was packed. I wasn’t allowed to keep my hand luggage with me even after explaining that I’d a short connection after. Got no attention from ground staff. All rude on their phones disregarding client’s urgencies. Missed my connection flight due to long waiting time at the belt for my checked in hand luggage. They didn’t arranged another flight nor overnight staying after spending an hour and half on the phone with customer service that sounded like was going to solve my problem but let me on hold for an hour. I do not recommend not even to my worst enemy.

### "Employees are nice but are not empowered"
Not Verified | Zero customer service; phone hold times over 2 hours, their assistance bot couldn't be any more useless, absolutely no help at any counters. Pay extra for Flex, can't even use it because there's no one to help and no one answers any phones. Employees are nice but are not empowered to really help you beyond a kind word; Honestly, the company puts them in the line of fire to distance themselves instead of doing anything solve any issues. Wish I could score them lower all around, save your money fly with someone who actually cares.

### "recommend avoiding this airline"
I was on a 3-month trip with most of my favorite clothes. Air Transat lost my checked bag. There has been no way to reach a human; phone numbers refer to the online system. I took each step recommended online. It has been 3 months, and I have received nothing but an auto-reply to my substantial claim of loss. I highly recommend avoiding this airline at all costs.

### "zero customer service"
Worst customer service ever. I had to cancel my flight as my father passed away suddenly. I was refunded around £500 for tickets I paid £1195 for. I eventually found an email address which is largely hidden on their websites and email confirmations to get a hold of customer services. I have tried to get in touch with customer services as I have not had a reply back over the last 2 weeks. There is zero customer service from this airline.

### "waste of money on the return flight"
I just returned from Glasgow yesterday on an Air Transat plane, quite old, maybe an A330. My seat was changed three times prior to going to the airport, and as usual I paid the extra for Option Plus on both legs of the journey. This was a waste of money on the return flight. In the boarding area there was just loads of people with no organisation whatsoever I did ask one of the attendants when are they calling option plus and she informed me that it would be called after the people who required medical assistance. Once again this did not happen as they boarded the people in group one, then started to board group two .. shortly after they call all groups to board. This was bad enough but once in the air it didn’t get any better. I had to ask for a blanket as I was extremely cold, this is when I finally told him that I was option plus. He was very surprised, then went back to get me the blanket package. There was no snacks after takeoff, surprisingly. Then came the meal which was given to everyone on the plane? I always take option plus for the convenience of my flight, but never have I had to tell anyone on board that I had it. I was very disappointed by this and of my luggage was tagged as priority and yet I was the last one to leave the carousel. I feel in this case that I should be given a refund of the money I paid for Option Plus.

### "customer service is hit or miss"
We never heard Club Class being called, yet heard they will be calling by groups. They called 2-5, then shortly after added 6&7. We lined up and while in line my spouse went up to the counter and inquired about Club Class, and the Attendant said “we did, you missed it”. Nothing else, so she joined me back in line. I  mentioned it to the Attendant while being greeted coming aboard and she simply, “well all those people did” (gesturing to the 8 of the 12 people seated in Club Class). So after paying for Club Class, what was our reward - arriving at our seats to find the overhead cabins were unavailable. Understandable, as they are used for staff/plane storage. Acceptable but no alternative immediately available until the gentleman seated next to us offered us space. For the extra value spent, it was a horrible beginning to a long-awaited trip to Spain. Hoping our return trip is much better! In todays challenging environment, it seems like customer service is hit or miss. BTW - our hostess was cheerful, friendly and hospitable - something that could be beneficial to the gate counter lead and plane boarding attendant.

### "vegetarian and I was given a chicken meal"
Not Verified |  The seats are good since I paid extra to get it. However, my meal selection was vegetarian and I was given a chicken meal. Thank God I am always cautious and these situations make me more paranoid and not trust people and services. I was given chicken pasta instead of veg pasta. I called the rep and asked if this was veg or chicken. The guy laughed and said no it's chicken, it's a mistake. I am vegetarian because I have severe allergies to meat, fish and seafood products. He went and brought back a veg pasta and there was no apology nothing. Gave me butter but no bread but others got bread. The movies are same as other Air Transat and old ones. I paid extra to get this?

### "Worst flying experience"
Not Verified | Montreal to Brussels. Worst flying experience so far in my life. Upgraded to economy plus, to make sure of priority luggage handling. Its been a week since I landed now and no new of my lost luggage yet, which I need to properly execute my job. No way to get proper response and help the claim of being available 24/7 is a blatant lie. Next to this in flight there was no option for my dietary restriction to which the staff promptly gave me chicken and pasta, where I just made clear I don't eat meat. Truly terrible and costing me money at this moment every day I can't do my job properly

### "lousy customer service"
Not Verified | Toronto to Fort Lauderdale. This is the worst customer service ever. I bought some tickets from Toronto to Fort Lauderdale for September 9, 2022. Since Immigration Canada has not sent me my new permanent residence card, I cannot travel. I have been trying to communicate with Air Transat for days and finally, after an hour and fifty minutes of waiting, they answered me in customer service. After explaining the situation to the woman who answered, she promised me that everything was resolved and that I only had to call my agent (Flighthub), and that they could give me the credit to travel on another date or when I received the new permanent resident card. So I called my agent but they checked and there was no note on the reservation. And they told me that I should call Air Transat again. I have been trying for the last two days with no success. I have called several times and after more than an hour of waiting per call, this is disconnected by Air Transat. My trip is scheduled for tomorrow morning so I will lose almost CA$1000 due to Air Transat's lousy customer service. I don't understand why the woman told me this and she didn't do anything. It's totally unfair

### "airline was totally unhelpful"
Not Verified |  This was my third experience with this airline this year, and will be the last. I have never departed on time and they seem to have very poor organisation. The way they treat passengers is not friendly and they are not helpful at all. Boarding chaotic and priority order not respected. On our last trip we were travelling in club class and our luggage had special tags and were supposed to be delivered first at arrival - they lost our suitcase. Their website instruct passengers to contact their agent at the airport, but there was no air Transat agent or desk at Basel airport. The airline was totally unhelpful and to date we have not heard anything from them or any other party regarding our lost luggage. No idea if our luggage was lost at Montreal airport, Basel airport or stolen. No apologies, no compensation. What is the point of paying an extra fee for a better service if there is no service in the end.

### "flight to Lisbon and back to Toronto was a nightmare"
My flight to Lisbon and back to Toronto was a nightmare. The plane was so old that not even a logo had, the chairs didn’t work, the arm chairs were broken, the meal - couldn’t touch a thing, it’s unbelievable how a company like Air Transat uses these kind of planes and charges the ridiculous amount of money for the tickets. I will never again buy a flight with Air Transat.

### "Frustrating and disappointing experience"
Not Verified |  I flew with Air Transat because the tickets were cheap. Now I know why. I took 3 flights with this company. Each flight was at least 30 minutes late. I had two returning flights. Because my first flight was late, I scrambled and ran to my 2nd one. No surprise, it was late. When I went to board, I was informed that AT rebooked me to a later flight due to the delay of the first flight. I requested to stay on my original flight. The attendants were unable to make this happen electronically despite (1) my seat still being available and extra seats available and (2) me actually being there and on time. I had no voice or autonomy in this change, which was unreasonable and surprising. I will never fly with Air Transat again. I will never recommend that my friends, family, or colleagues fly with Air Transat. Frustrating and disappointing experience.

### "unbelievably poor customer experience"
Air Transat provides an unbelievably poor customer experience. My flight was delayed by 3hr in Gatwick resulting a missed connection and loss of baggage. Furthermore the check in staff at Gatwick were aware I would miss my flight and were unable to rebook my itinerary. Really poor customer experience. Furthermore following the loss of my baggage the airline handed my luggage to a really poor no name courier firm at Toronto who are seemingly unable to communicate. Again any other airline would use a reputable firm such as UPS, FedEx or DHL. Finally the A321 provides a really poor experience flying transatlantic. In total you are best spending your money on a full service airline such as British Airways or Lufthansa.

### "Would never recommend this airline"
Would never recommend this airline. Let start off with the first flight where I purchase flight and upgrades to reserve seating and leg room. Roughly 700 additional each way plus the previous 1000 for the ticket. The day of the flight they decided to charge the plane and remove my reservation to the seats I paid for. Then placed me at the back of the plane with zero leg room. Being a 6ft tall male makes the seating they gave me quite uncomfortable. The plane was unfit to fly exhaust fumed from the engines entering th cabin, the seats falling apart and major electrical issues. Had the reading light on my flight on for 7hrs, no one could turn it off cause the button on my seat controlled the seat 5 rows ahead of mine. On top off all of this the flight team did nothing nor served drinks. Went 7hrs with out water was a joke. On the return flight same seat scenario occurred. My seats were changed even though they were pre reserved and then reconfirm after the first flight was a mess. They still managed to mess it up, along the flight the in flight manager was harrasing my parent who dont speak English, who had paid and reserved seating front row before first class (which they were trying to take). They want to give it to a young couple with a baby. So i came up from the rear of the plane to diffuse the problem and move my parents to help out the young couple out. Even though the couple was completely rude and disrespectful, we still helped out at our cost even though not only me paying 700x4 for upgrades which would of covered my parents to be moved to first class. They put them in the back of the plane and took out upgrade money. I began the claim in July and it is now 30+ days and they have yet to reach out to refund my money for the upgrades.

### "I am considered fully vaccinated"
I booked an emergency flight to Amsterdam, but I got rejected while checking in because I don't have three doses of the covid-vaccine even though your own website and Amsterdam's government website states that you only need two to travel from Toronto to Amsterdam. I am considered fully vaccinated. You cost me not only missing the funeral, but my time, gas, tears, and money.

### "worst experience in air travel"
Toronto to Dublin. The worst airline anyone could ever think of, with ridiculous service and overworked staff. Lost baggage and nobody is even looking for it. My worst experience in air travel.

### "they have no crew to fly"
Departure was on time, however as soon as everyone was seated captain announced that they have no crew to fly and will have to go to London to get replacement crew, by doing so we lost about 3 hours. New crew started complaining about shortage of cups and some other stuff. In  the flight captain announced that toilet's on the airplane stopped working and we will have to land in Montreal in order to look at it. Waist tank was full and needed to be pumped. After pumping the tank we continue to Toronto with total of 13.5 hours (6.5 hours delay).

### "such awful customer service"
Lisbon to Los Angeles via Montreal. As others have said, their lost luggage service is virtually non-existent. Air Transat lost a bag almost two months ago, and we still haven't gotten a reimbursement! Calling or emailing for an update is simply impossible. No one responds to email, the website is no help, and the baggage hotline just redirects to the website. I've never experienced such awful customer service in my life. It's no use buying a low-cost airfare if you're going to get screwed in the long run.

### "I will never fly with them again"
The waiting time for calling them is over 4 hours easily. We have this small rescue dog, weighing about 10lbs, we would like to bring her with us to the trip. Before we purchased the ticket, we checked airline website to see the pet policy, and it was stated, that we could pay for the pets in carry on bag. So I was trying to reach the airline to pre-pay for the carry-on pet. I was on hold for over an hour and talked to a gentleman who claimed he didn't know how to do it and transferred me to another line, which I waited for more than 3 hours, so by the time, i got to talk to the lady, the time had passed 72 hours prior boarding time. and i was told i couldn't pre-pay to reserve for the carry on dog, and i need to go to the desk on the departure day, My family arrived the evening before our flight and I double checked with the desk people, and an on duty manager said it was OK, I was hoping to pay and make sure she can come on board on the next day flight. The guy said i couldn't do it until 4 hours to departure. So we got to the desk 3 hours before departure, the line person, the desk person all let us pass and put a sticker on our dog's bag. We boarded the airplane. For this flight, I paid extra 175 for reserving some seats for my whole family. The flight attendant found our dog bag was in front of my husband's seat, which is a special seat, no other seat in front of him, complained the bag needs to be underneath the front seat, how we could get this seat first place with a dog carry on. They got a gate person up to complain, and the gated person wanted me to show the receipt we paid for the dog, i told her what happened, and i didn't get a chance to pay for her on the phone or through the check in desk. So she started accusing us smuggling in the dog, as if we were criminal, even we showed her the canal sticker on the bag, and told her we got checked in by their airline desk. She insisted throwing us off the airplane and was very rude. I begged for paying at the spot, she said there is no way for her to take the money. Finally i moved the dog bag to be in front of my seat, behind another seat, the plane attendants were OK with it, she still insisted in throwing us out, other passengers were trying to speak for us. Finally the pilot said it is OK to let us fly. The entire episode lasted over an hour. my family and I were totally stressed. We finally made it. I will never fly with them again.

### "dysfunctional website and app"
A dysfunctional website and app that doesn't allow ticket change or booking a special meal. It leads to errors all the time. No technical support. No one answering the phone after hours of waiting and dozens of attempts. Therefore no possibilities to change my ticket or do with an agent what I can't do online. No warnings about anything, no one telling you anything. The worst airline I ever flew with.

### "We were shocked and so stressed"
We were returning from our trip to Western Canada via Calgary Airport on July 29, 2022. Out of approximately 200 people flying, the agent at the Boarding kiosk, we lined for my husband and me sitting and waiting for boarding call. Prior to that they kept announcing that the flight was full and there was no room for carry on luggage. Not too many people got up to give up their carry on because of what has been happening at the airports with lost luggage and chaos. Having flown to Europe with Air Transat June 23-July 6, 2022 for a Mediterranean cruise, they lost my husband’s luggage and we never got it back while in Europe. So when the agent came and asked us to give up our carry on, which they allow to have, I spoke up loud and clear that “sorry Madam but I’m not going to do that because your airline lost my luggage on June 23 and have not found it plus I have my meds in and what am I to do if I don’t get this luggage in Toronto” My husband tried to explain as well, but she walked away. Shortly after this she brought her boss to us who without listening to my story, told me to “shut up” and asked my husband for our Boarding Passes. He confiscated them and told us that where we would be sitting Row 16 there was no room for any carry on luggage, period. He also told us that I was confrontational and aggressive towards the agent and it will not be tolerated. My husband decided to check our only 1 carry on. When he approached the kiosk, a new agent who was told to keep our Boarding Passes, started on my husband. Asked where I was to get me now. I approached with my small backpack and my husband had a backpack as well as personal items. The agent threatened that if I speak, because I asked if I could tell him my story, he will call security and remove us from our flight. He also demanded for us to check our personal items, that is our backpacks, no ifs or buts. We had no choice but to give up our personal items. I flew and was cold through my 3hrs 50 mins flight. We were shocked and so stressed. Never had I been treated like this in all the time I have been flying. Other people had duffle bags, that barely fitted under the seat, lots of room overhead because we saw when people were removing their belongings. We just prayed we would receive our bags, and yes we did. We also stayed and tried searching for our luggage from previous trip to no avail. Finally on Aug 3, 2022 we got our luggage delivered to our home after non-stop calls to Air Transat, we had the luggage dept on speed dial and once a week we could actually speak to an agent. Finally after 6 weeks we got our luggage from our first trip with Air Transat.

### "airline misplaced my baggage"
My flight was from Toronto to Calgary. The airline misplaced my baggage, it's been more than 24hrs now. Came back to the airport with an uber necause they never gave me any tracking number on the yellow slip, called more than 50 times. Zero help. A very terrible and bad experience for my first flight with this Airline and it will be the last time.

### "no apologies, no explanation as to why the delay"
We flew from Calgary-Montreal-Paris. Paid almost $350 for the 3 checked bags. Our bags never arrived in Paris. We filed a "missing bags" complaint after arrival with a great difficulty as English is not their forte. The flight was delayed just over 2 hours to Paris. Till the day we were in Paris, our luggage was never delivered, there was no communication from Air Transat to us about the luggage. In Paris, they did not even know where our luggage was! We followed up everyday (actually my nephew would call as he is fluent in French) lucky us as we had him, I can only imagine what other customers would be going through who cannot speak French as to if they would even get a response. We got a call from some driver who was to deliver our luggage 2 days after we arrived and said to us that "we have your bags and we will deliver at 7 pm" we did not know that they only had one bag. We cancelled our sightseeing plans and rushed home to find out with dismay that no bags were delivered and no call was made to inform us why. After this date, everyday we would follow up and got told that our bags would be delivered at 7 pm but never followed through. Finally the day before we were leaving Paris to Delhi via a different airline (22nd morning) we drove to airport to get our luggage. We thought we were to go to the terminal and talk to someone at Air Transat. To our surprise, we got a call from SOS Baggage and were told all our bags, not just one or two, are with them. Air Transat apparently hands over customers luggage's to some "baggage delivery service" which in turn hands it over to this SOS Baggage company that actually is a store which sells travel bags and accessories. The customer service at this place was pathetic - no apologies, no explanation as to why the delay, why these were not delivered for these many days nothing! On my insistence and a bit of raising the voice, I was finally given emails about paper trail and to my utter dismay they had the bags since 18th June, the very next day we arrived in Paris. It is pathetic that Air Transat deals with such a company that charges them for bags delivery but never does, is unprofessional, provides lousy customer service and does not give a rats ass for customer or their vacation plans going haywire. Nobody till date has even contacted us with an apology, compensation nothing. Worst customer service. Isn't there an EU rule that if your flight is delayed by 2 hours you get 50% compensation?

### "one of our luggage never came"
Toronto to Zagreb, I wish we had one good thing to say except one friendly flight attendant that made small chat. The rest of the staff seemed out on a mission to make passengers suffer. I was woken up from sleep bc the mask slid off my nose. To make it more interesting, while having the meal, the flight attendant reminded me to have a mask on. At the end of the flight an attendant reminded me to have the seat up. I showed her by pressing the button that the seat is broken, it doesn’t go up. She pushes on it and again it doesn’t move. She gets angry and argues that she is doing her job. She brings another attendant who says that the attendant is doing her job. I repeat, the seat is broken. She pushes the button. The seat doesn’t move. At That point she is shaking the seat with full force and two hands manages to move it up. And to end the trip one of our luggage never came. It’s been 4 days now and there has been no communication form air transat on the status of our lost property.

### "understanding, very polite and very helpful"
Not Verified |  I would like to thank Twyla Tracey, who was a great help to me on two occasions. She was very understanding, very polite and very helpful. This was the first time booking online and I ran into problems, and she was able to help me sort everything out. This is a big thank you to Twyla.

### "overall Air Transat experience was pretty lacklustre"
While the staff on this flight were fine, the aircraft and overall Air Transat experience were pretty lacklustre. The plane felt extremely tired and dated - no screens, the USB outlets didn’t work (apparently this was the case for the whole flight), the beverage options were tiny and the inflight entertainment system worked for all of 5 minutes, and then stopped. They charged $11 for headphones, which people were unable to use due to there being no TVs, etc. This was a completely different experience from our other flight with Air Canada, who had USB A and USB C outlets, as well as standard AC outlets, had the screens with a bunch of entertainment options (movies, shows, maps), the drinks were standard size drinks (ie, a full soda can) We’ll definitely avoid flying Air Transat again, as it appears they cut costs in comfort.

### "No effort is being made to locate our baggage in a timely manner"
Not Verified |  Terrible customer service! Airline lost ours and about 10 people's bags on the flight to Calgary. Upon landing, there were no Air Transat employees at the Calgary Airport to help. An airport employee helped everyone file a report and we were told that we would be called the following day. 5 days later and still no call. We have tried emailing and calling multiple times. No answer when calling, no call back after leaving multiple messages. We received an email back and were told that they can't access our file until 7 days after the flight. We even went back to the airport to try and talk to someone in person - also no help. An Air Canada employee was actually much more helpful than anyone from Air Transat. No effort is being made to locate our baggage in a timely manner. We were planning on camping in Banff on this trip, however, all of our camping gear is in the lost baggage. We are now forced to go buy new gear (tent, sleeping pads, etc.) or pay $300 a night for a hotel in Banff. Baggage gets lost, it happens. However, this customer service is atrocious. Never recommend flying Air Transat!

### "3 hours delay with no explanation"
3 hours delay with absolutely no explanation why the flight keeps being postponed every 45 minutes. This is not an airline, it is horrible service.

### "Options Plus is not not worth one dime"
Paying for Options Plus is a scam. You supposedly changed the rules of what you receive as a Plus. In Toronto I was registering in Economy and not Options Plus (as no one was there) for a flight that was leaving for 9am. I was told to go to gate C2 for boarding. My partner and I sat there for 2 hours and no one said that the gate was changed. Luckily we started to notice no one at our gate and checked the screen. Oh yes, Gate got changed. There was no announcement. What I am most shocked about is that on top of the fee that I was charged Options Plus I still had to pay another fee for seat selection. In the past, everything was included under Options Plus. So I'm in the plane now and then find out that you don't get a meal with Options Plus or any of the other amenities any longer. Well let me tell you for the fee that you charged me for Options Plus is not not worth one dime. Now I'm in Punta Cana coming home and again it didn't matter if I was under Options Plus - I could have been in the line-up for Economy. So the only benefit I found when you pay for Options Plus is that you get your baggage first - that's it. In total for 2 ppl, $316.00 was charged. I have been flying with Air Transat since about 2008/2009, and this is now the last time. In addition, while staying at the Bahia Principe in Punta Cana and 3 days before we were returning to Canada, we could not locate the Air Transat rep to find out when the bus was picking us up for the airport. All the other airline reps were there everyday, except her representing Air Transat. When she did finally show up, she was rude that we were making her accountable for not being around. Then in speaking with the other ppl taking the same flight as us, they had made comments that they couldn't find Air Transat rep at the same resort we were at. Anyway it is my fault for not checking that the amenities that were included under Options Plus, no longer exists and I feel that I got so ripped off.

### "won’t travel with this airline again"
I’m having this flight for the second time and it was late both of the times. This time we had to wait for 5 hour and we  were not even informed earlier. We got to know about the delay when we checked in. I won’t travel with this airline again.

### "It is impossible to speak to anyone to sort out your problems"
Not Verified |  Voicing what other reviewers have said, Air Transat call centre/customer service is non existent. After waiting for hours, you still don't get a chance to talk to anyone. The option to add a suitcase before 24 hours so you can pay a little less was impossible to achieve on their website or app. I have been on the phone with them for 1h30+ and did not manage to speak with anyone. On my flight to Toronto from London, the cabin crew pointed out I could speak with the Air Transat people who would be waiting at the gate. I explained my issue about adding my suitcase for my return, and their answer was still you need to call this number, and they would pick up this Canadian number in 15 minutes. I said I couldn't call from Canada because I don't have a Canadian phone, and asked to call from theirs - of course the lady looked at her colleague nervously smiling and told me she wasn't allowed to do so. When speaking to people in the check-in area, they explained in most areas they are sub-contracted employees from Air Transat and they cannot help with anything else than paying for your luggage when you get to the airport 2h before your flight. It is impossible to speak to anyone to sort out your problems - avoid at all costs! Additionally, how ridiculous is it to charge extra for luggage on a Trans-Atlantic flight? Furthermore, food in the plane is stingy and borderline inedible. Kudos to the cabin crew though, working in that environment I am sure they put up with every day, they were quite lovely.

### "Luggage is sitting in Montreal"
Not Verified |  Writing this on Sunday night, we flew Wednesday. Luggage is sitting in Montreal, Transat knows where it is and still won't send it. It's starting to feel personal at this point. I would try Air Canada, West jet or a Euro company before Transat as they really don't seem too concerned about our family's trip at all.

### "aircraft did not offer a bassinet"
Not Verified |  I had a very hard time getting in touch with customer service, over an hour wait. I originally spoke with an agent before booking who confirmed the availability of seats with extra leg space as I was travelling with 2 kids by myself. Of course, after paying and booking the air Transat agent said there were only 2 seats available and I had to let go. Two agents were giving me conflicting information and I asked to speak with a manager- they said you will have to wait an "unknown" amount of time which can be a few hours! It was also disappointing that a aircraft with a long flight to Europe did not offer a bassinet. They claim the seats are bigger in this new aircraft but I did not feel that was the case. I also tried to modify our return booking- I wasn't able to do so via the App or website, I kept on getting an error message and had to call customer service and wait for more than an hour. I travel a lot and this is by far the worst airline service- never to be repeated.

### "never book another ticket with them"
I booked my air Transat flight going to Montreal from Calgary, didn’t get any online check in notification from my home 24 hrs before my flight but I was there almost 2 hour my flight. 12:45 pm I was in the line at 11am before waited in line half n hour after when it’s my turn to check in desk lady put me in the system, she is like boarding is already closed. I was like I was waiting in the line from half n hour how come boarding is closed so early she said now we can’t do anything their staff really need some training. I paid almost 450$. I was trying to contact their customer service the waiting time was 3 hours. Than I have to book another flight for same day I paid 1000$ for my domestic flight my flight was going to Montreal from Calgary. Montreal to calgary what happened in Montréal airport on June 1 Wednesday is I was waiting in the line from 2 hrs my flight was 8:35pm I was there at 6:30 waiting in line from 1.5 hr lady after checking my id and ticket, she said I cannot find you in the system. After taking my 20 mins she gave me boarding pass, how come she find me in the system now they really have to improve. I will never book another ticket with them.

### "Tried to call them dozens of times"
Not Verified |  Tried to call them dozens of times over the past month and they simply never answer their phone. Not been able to speak to a single person, despite waiting hours on the line. Contacted them via social and they say you have to call to make changes and that's the only number. Don't even know if they actually exist. It's cost me hundreds of dollars now in phone charges and increased prices. Would complain, but they tell you to call...AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

### "I would never repeat"
Manchester to Vancouver via Toronto. Where do I start, first booked in 2019 direct flight business class to Vancouver, return from Calgary to Manchester, economy class. Due to covid had to rebook year by year till last year when it looked that our holiday would go ahead. After change of flight times resulting in a cancellation of a hotel, and a 17hr stop over in Toronto tried to speak to someone after several hours on the phone on hold gave up. Finally after a £30 phone call got through to a most unpleasant person who was no help at all. Then they informed me that the plane model has changed for our flight from Manchester and that we were moved to economy class not being happy tried to contact them again no success the web site is rubbish and their app a joke it doesn't even recognise our booking number (after they said several times it would be sorted) and we have less than 3 weeks to fly. How they get to be the best service? God only knows I would never repeat never recommend Air Transat to anybody.

### "excellent service"
Not Verified | Toronto to Manchester. Great flight excellent service on board and at the desk. Attendants were helpful and kind to us old couple. The only thing was the seat cushions were VERY uncomfortable.

### "Air Transat have done their best to ruin the start of my trip"
Not Verified |  Air Transat moved my flight to an earlier time several weeks after booking, which messed up all of my reservations at the other end. Several weeks later, Air Transat cancelled my club class reservation and offered to replace it for an economy seat. The refund that was offered did not reflect the cost difference between an economy seat and club class seat at the time of booking, which is daylight robbery. I haven't been away in a while and travelling to America is a once in a lifetime experience, so I thought I'd treat myself, but Air Transat have done their best to ruin the start of my trip. Make sure you book with a different airline as these people will mess you about. I wish I'd listened to the other reviews.

### "they were with their sarcasm just laughing"
Returning May, 27/ 2022, from the Dominican Republic, flight 187 arriving in Toronto at 4:45 PM. We stayed in the aircraft for to hours because of the backup of the security. They’ve told us they would put water in the toilets, not so people were looking. After the 2 hours wait, the captain announced, we can board people with children from 12 and under. Not so, even the older once went. Nobody came back. After a while 50 of the rest could go, etc there was a group of people, on the aircraft returning from a wedding, Standing and making it difficult for others to get by, even-so they were told to sit down. Mask was mandatory, but not for some people. One lady was yelling, shots, shots, and open the bottle of liquor. Finally as we elderly people got to the exit, we complained to the Captain and staff, they were with their sarcasm just laughing.

### "no one was even ready to listen"
I was travelling on last Friday(attached doc) from Toronto to Montreal. And when i went to take my boarding pass in Toronto the air Transat person said that we have less space in airplane you can submit you cabin bag for free. I  submitted and when i reached in Montreal at around 7:30 i waited 1 hour near the belt and there was literally no one to help. There was no counter for air Transat help. I asked some other person they just said we don't work for the company we don't know. I went to the departure place just to see if there is someone there if they can help as all my original documents were there in my bag and i could not afford to loose them. I went upstairs where they give boarding passes said you have to call air Transat we are not responsible for your luggage. I called air Transat and there was no one again to help on call. I felt helpless no one was even ready to listen. And after i was literally crying aloud then when one of person got up and took my boarding pass picture and went to check and he found my bag.

### "I would not hesitate to recommend Air Transat"
Not Verified |  On May 17th my wife and I flew from Rome to Toronto on flight 309. My wife had been injured in a fall the previous day and was experiencing acute pain due to three breaks in her upper right arm. When the Air Transat onboard staff realized her situation, they showed deep concern and compassion for her comfort and well being. During the 8+ hour flight at least one of the onboard staff would check on her on a regular basis. Kind gestures such as exhibited by the Air Transat staff were deeply appreciated. Because of the service we received I would not hesitate to recommend Air Transat at any time. Going forward, my wife and I will certainly enquire as to the availability of Air Transat when planning our next vacation.

### "Terrible airline experience"
Terrible airline experience. Wife and I prepaid to select seats together as she has an anxiety disorder and is terrified of flying. They changed our seats for return flight without notifying us to separate ends of the plane with no notice, being quite rude, and no refund offered. Agent could not inform why this occurred or direct us where to ask for a refund. Have still not been contacted (I've contacted them without response) or offered refund for extra paid to select the seats. My wife had an anxiety attack on the return flight, again, no accommodation, refund, or even apology. Was told its not their problem by agent prior to flight. Also lost my luggage for the week of the vacation with no follow up or compensation. Horrendous customer service. Would never recommend.

### "The stewardesses, went above and beyond to help us"
I had 2 major surgeries in Puerto Vallarta and was in a lot of pain. We just needed to get home. The stewardesses, went above and beyond to help us, one let me get a personal water bottle and both of them kept checking on my husband and I. I was last to deboard and they both helped us. I can't say enough on how grateful we were that they took the time to care with do much sincerity.

### "plane left over 50 minutes late"
Very unhappy with Air Transat and their lack of professionalism, plane left over 50 minutes late due to waiting on one of the pilots arrival. We boarded 40 minutes late than sat on the tarmac waiting for another 45 minutes. Asked one of the Cabin attendants why the delay and he just shrugged his shoulders and brushed me off, no apology or reason. I understand that there are delays and issues from time to time but this is not acceptable.

### "an awful way to start off a 10-day vacation"
Not Verified |  The airline attendants were the most ignorant, rude and unprofessional people I have ever met. I would not recommend flying what Air Transat. I'm hoping my flight home is much more enjoyable, an awful way to start off a 10-day vacation in Montego Bay. I had to actually walk away from one attendant because she was just so nasty to my girls.

### "Air Transat assistant never came back"
Not Verified |  My wife requires a wheelchair and Air Transat was informed. To their credit, an Air Transat employee was on hand departing Toronto, arriving and departing Cancun. They were all excellent in assisting us. Then we arrived back in Toronto. A young man met us at the plane's doors. He had no idea what he was doing and only with my help did he negotiate the ramps. Then he wheeled us to an elevator down an empty corridor. Unfortunately I had to use the washroom at that point and he left us us there saying he had to check n any other passengers who needed assistance. I used the facilities but security wouldn't allow me to return to my wife. 20 minutes later, an elevator arrived near where I was frantically trying to get some help. Another passenger was pushing my wife's wheelchair. The Air Transat assistant never came back. That SOB left a mobility needy senior alone in a corridor for nearly 20 minutes. Subsequently, I was unable to talk to an Air Transat agent on the phone. Talking to a real person is nearly impossible. Everything else about our flight to and from Canxun was fine but what a way to finish off the first vacation we've had in 45 years.

### "Unacceptable"
Not Verified | Lisbon to Toronto. Air Transat didn't even offer a coffee or tea on a transatlantic flight! Unbelievable. We didn't even have the right to drink a glass of wine or beer. Unacceptable! When you call Air Transat there is the same recording for 1 year or more than the waiting time will be more than 1 hour. Unacceptable! How many employees do they have? They always give you that same chewy disgusting pizza before landing. We are not animals. What's wrong with Air Transat? It used to be synonymous with a good time. Now it has become a real nightmare It will be my last choice from now on.

### "just want to warn anyone traveling with this company to think twice"
Where do I even start.... what a horrible airline. I will 100% not be flying with this company anymore. We were flying with about 40 guests for our destination wedding when 2 days before our departure flight my grandmother had a heart attack and 3 of our family members had to stay back to ensure my grandmother was okay in the hospital. Trying to change/cancel/get a credit for these flights home was horrible. No one would take our call and when asked said we did not cancel in their 24 hour policy, yet we sent numerous emails and calls at the 48 hour mark of our departure. No one was willing to call back or email. Our family members are still in Costa Rica uncertain when they will be arriving home. All Air Transat needed to do was to change their flight or provide a credit. However instead of applying these changes they were rude, unprofessional. During a hard and very uncertain time it would of been nice to have an airline that wanted to make your arrival home easy. It’s just funny since one of the family members who had to cancel their flight was traveling with Air Canada and they ended up getting a credit for their return flight home. I just want to warn anyone traveling with this company to think twice!

### "Such an awful airline with 0 customer service!"
Such an awful airline with 0 customer service! How can they change the time of our flight so significantly twice and fail to tell us the second time around? Is an email to notify your customers too much of a task for you? Absolute joke!

### "airline is not worth a second look"
A terrible experience with "customer service". If you need help from Air Transat, forget about it - you are on your own. We booked a package with Air Transat (flight and accommodation). While at the airport departing to come home my son (a minor) received a false positive COVID test the day of our departure. Not the airlines fault, clearly. That same day I was able to get a letter from the local health authority authorizing him to fly the following morning. After being on hold for over two hours, Air Transat would not help rebook and effectively said "we don't care, not our problem". No attempt to re-book a flight out, nothing. We ended up booking on another carrier to get back home. Air Transat literally abandoned a minor. This airline is not worth a second look.

### "Great customer service"
Not Verified |  My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at the Barcelo Maya Palace Resort. The flight from Toronto to Cancun on February 3, 2023 was flawless. On our return date on February 17, 2022, we were supposed to be picked up at the resort by included shuttle as notified by the App the day before at 8.30am. The shuttle arrived late and picked up a family but we were left stranded by the driver who informed us that we were not on the list and he had no room for us as the shuttle was full. A cab was dispatched that brought us to the Airport for $75 American dollars. I was given a receipt by the driver. At the Air Transat check in kiosk, I spoke with an Air Transat representative at the kiosk. She acted promptly and she personally took the time to speak with the Air Transat people at a nearby office and immediately was able to reimburse me for the cost of the taxi. Great customer service. I have flown with Air Transat in the past and I will continue to do so in the future. All around, great customer service. Thank you.

### "a pleasant experience"
Ft Lauderdale to Toronto. What a pleasant experience from the Fort Lauderdale counter to the plane. At the Fort Lauderdale the staff was so humble and funny while he was checking all our paperwork. He took our stress away. On the plane, the staff were super amazing to handle my kids inquiries. They answered them very professionally. We received sanitizers pack and complementary drinks. I needed that so much so as my kids. Very polite. Plane entertainment system! I wasn’t aware Air Transat has entertainment for free! You can bring your own headphones and Voila you have hours of entertainments! Last ten years I have been traveling to Florida twice a year to my parents it’s just a three hour flight so never experienced this type of awesome service. My kids didn’t have any headphones the flight attendant provided headphones for free! It was getting better and better! Thank you Air Transat for your awesome service. I will be traveling soon in March to Punta Cana! Hopefully I will be able to travel with you guys again.

### "Worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service I've ever experienced. I have been trying to reach them for two days, waited for more than an hour, and they either hang up or never answer. I needed to cancel a flight and get a travel credit, which they said I could at the time of the reservation, and the only contact they provide is this.

### "avoid all obligations to their customers"
Not Verified |  I am writing about a forthcoming trip and the impossibility to contact Air Transat. Trip: Montreal-Nantes/Bordeaux-Montreal, France. Reservation made August 2021, departure 5 June 2022. Recently, I received an itinerary change (date/time change) notification from Air Transat. Now, when I check 'My Booking', I get the message: "Booking cannot be found". The only way AT offers contact service is by telephone, but, the wait is 3++ hours and when choosing the 'call-back' option, no-one calls back. They have removed their email contact service from the website. This is a pre-paid trip and I am worried that this is a pre-bankruptcy ploy by the company to steal our money and avoid all obligations to their customers.

### "complaint is how to contact Air Transat"
Not Verified |  I have flown with Air Transat over the past 20 years. Like most people we had to cancel trips during Cocvid-19. My complaint is how to contact Air Transat. I have been on hold for 4.75 hours, many times, waiting to talk to them to resolve an issue. Still haven't got through. I decided lets try an email, nowhere is there a contact email visible on the web site. Their phone message says there is one. This website link should be on the front page so customers can email them direct, instead of waiting 4-5 hours.

### "being waiting on hold for online"
Not Verified |  I made my reservation online couples of weeks ego. I need to confirm everything before I leave on the 28th because I am leaving from Montreal and do not wish to make the trip without making sure that all is good. And also have some questions regarding luggage and prices. because on the website it says that the 3rd piece of luggage would be 235$. I understand the 1 being 35, 2nd being 65$ but the 3rd one being 235$ is a bit tough. I have being waiting on hold for online for 42hrs already for the past 3 days with no answer and a very very irritating horrible music. I have tried the chat yesterday Oct 18th where I waited almost 2 hours to the point that I forgot about and when about doing my stuff ... someone answered but I wasn't there so I missed it. I have to say that the airlines are taking for granted that people want to travel but, eventually we will get fed up with the bad services.

### "it is not covid safe"
I flew on flight TS932 from Toronto to Vancouver in August 2021 and the flight attendants were rude and unsafe. The flight was packed, and half the flight was not wearing masks. The flight attendants made no effort at all to ask people to put their masks on, I felt very unsafe. One of the flight attendants stopped to have a conversation with the couple beside me in French. They complained about how rude and unfriendly people from Ontario are, they said people from Ontario are lazy for not learning French, the flight attendant agreed and said that our accents are so terrible when we speak French that we shouldn’t even try. After that conversation the flight attendant gave the couple beside me free wine and beer. I found that entire conversation to be extremely insulting and ignorant, they assumed that no one on the flight could speak French simply because we were flying out of Toronto. On top of all of this the man in front of me reclined his seat fully, and was basically laying in my lap the entire flight, I’m not sure why they built the chairs like that, but it is not covid safe.

### "we want to thank our 2 stewards"
Not Verified |  If you download there site it makes it so easy to know what to do, it removed a lot of stress for me has you know Covid restriction keeps on changing but they are always on the ball service. On the plane excellent, we want to thank our 2 stewards flight 837, Nicholas and Eric, two nice guy that gave us excellent customer service. We are flying again in March with them not premium class this time but I’m sure the experience will be the same. Thank you for making our trip memorable from the beginning through the end.

### "They no longer answer the calls"
I booked a flight with them and bought 2 pieces of luggage. They rescheduled my flight with another airline with 1 luggage and told me to buy the second luggage yourself and we will refund you. It’s been almost a year that they did not process my claim while they say their process time is up to 3 months. They no longer answer the calls. I was on hold waiting for more than 2 hours twice.

### "Expedia is denying the free change"
I bought an Air Transat ticket through Expedia (big mistake -- Expedia is the worst.) It says on the itinerary that Air Transat changes are free and on AT's website, they say all flights/all ticket classes include free changes if purchased before August 31, 2021. (Mine was purchased in May 2021.) Expedia is denying the free change. I waited an hour on the phone with Air Transat for them to say it's not their issue but Expedia's. If you sell through Expedia, you're responsible. The agent on the phone said that the only way to resolve these issues is by conference call with both Expedia and Air Transat. I asked how I could do that and she said she did not know how it's possible to arrange such a conference call.

### "had to pay another 40$/luggage"
Since I was a kid I traveled with this airline, we always had the same carry-ons, but this time we had to register two of them as normal baggage, because the wheels couldn't fit in the small box sizing them, which meant we had to pay another 40$/luggage. After explaining ourselves, we said we would like to pay for one of them only, because if we knew, we would've brought one bigger luggage that fits the containing of both carry-ons. Not wanting to understand, the only thing the supervisor could say was: "These are the policies, we understand but we can't do anything" he talked to us as if we had no understanding of anything that was going on, he would repeat the same exact thing in the same condescending monotone way for about 5 times. After understanding he would not want to do anything to accommodate, I told him "Ok, you can leave then". His reaction was : going behind the counter and asking the person working under him "what is their security number" as if we did something that requires security. I literally just said, "Ok, you can leave then". I am still amazed that a supervisor would have this reaction, I think he was trying to find a way to intimidate us. Also, just so you know, don't register or verify your carry-ons, just take them with you, pass the customs, and they will take them for free at the boarding area.

### "still have not received a response"
Not Verified |  My flight was canceled for COVID-19 back in March of 2020. I was approved for a refund, but they refunded to a card that was paid off and closed. My bank refused the refund, so the money was sent back to Air Transat. Air Transat refuses to provide me with a refund through another route, they have stopped answering my chat messages, and "coincidentally" my calls are now dropped every time I call customer service. They had told me getting a letter from my bank confirming the refund was refused would help. I sent the letter via email to the correct address given, checked in two times since, and still have not received a response there either. They have essentially blocked me on all avenues of communication, even though I was never rude or confrontational.

### "offered a credit for future travel"
Not Verified |  The flight I booked was cancelled as a result of Covid. I requested a refund which was rejected by Air Transat, instead they offered a credit for future travel. I spend my winters in Mexico and Air Transat is no longer flying to Mexico, a credit is useless to me. I only fly to Mexico.

### "refused to give us back our money when the flight was cancelled"
Not Verified |  My flight was from Montreal to France and was schedule to depart in September 2020. Due to covid 19 the flight was cancelled. Vouchers were sent for us to make reservations in the next 2 years instead of giving us back our money. The reservation was for 4 people and was nearly 3K Can. dollars. We had pay well in advance approx. 6 months before the scheduled flight, Air Transat did not make any effort in re-paying its customers. They kept our money for over 1 year, until the government of Canada bailed them out. We have finally received our money back in May 2021. I am very upset that Air Transat kept our money and refused to give us back our money when the flight was cancelled. I will never, ever, ever book a flight with this company again, and I will never, ever recommend anyone from using Air Transat for a vacation or a flight, and this goes for all of the Canadian airline companies which use their customers money as a bargaining chip to negotiate with the government!

### "Outrageous customer service"
Not Verified |  We booked for a 3 week vacation. After 6 days at resort we received an email telling us we had to come home at the end of 2 weeks with a full refund for 1 week hotel accommodation credited to our credit card. Several emails and phone calls and no response to either myself or my travel agent. We have been home for 10 weeks. Outrageous customer service. Right now not certain will use again! Especially after they changed our departure airport from London to Toronto and only offer take it or leave it offer. Cost us extra money for Hotel and food both for departure and arrival. Plus: hour drive both ways and we are Seniors.

### "Still waiting for a refund"
Not Verified |  Still waiting for a refund. My family and I were due to fly on 25th July, 2020. Flight was cancelled. I was promised a refund on 5th August but advised it would take 16 weeks. 7 months later nothing. Utterly appalling behaviour.

### "informed me I would receive a refund"
Has Anyone actually received a refund from Air Transat ? We were due to fly from London Gatwick to Vancouver on 1st October 2020, but they cancelled the flight. On 2nd September 2020 they informed me I would receive a refund. I am still waiting. It is now the beginning of February,. This is very bad customer service.

### "Stick with reputable airlines"
Not Verified |  5 months later and still no refund for cancelled flight. I get that covid is an issue but 5 months is disgusting. Spoke to them and incredibly unhelpful and wouldn't even tell me who I was speaking to. Will never use again. Stick with reputable airlines.

### "they were very rude and refused to make any change"
Very disappointed. You would think that the airline would make an effort regarding customer service amid a pandemic and higher uncertainty regarding travel dates. I needed to switch dates for my round trip and I was willing to pay an extra fee, and they were very rude and refused to make any change even with high additional charges. Will not book with them again.

### "lost my trust and my business"
I booked a flight only to have it cancelled days later. When I called a few weeks after to follow up on the refund they told me it would be several months as they are currently still catching up on refunds from March! Almost as if they are only selling flights for the quick cash just to cancel them? Absolutely disgusting. They have lost my trust and my business. I will never fly with them again and will encourage everyone I know to go with more respectable airlines. Do yourself a favour and save your money!

### "only offer a voucher"
Very disappointed with the customer service of Air Transat. They cancelled our flight due to COVID19 and do not give us the full refund and only offer a voucher. According to Canadian Law, if the contract is frustrated, customers have the right to receive full refund, but the airline does not want to take this into consideration. Even though, my was from Orlando and US DOT require airlines to provide full refund due to the COVID19, they do not care to follow the requirement.

### "will not be flying in the future"
Not Verified |  Very disappointed to learn after Air Transat cancelled our flight no refund would be issued - only a credit. I realize Covid-19 is an extreme situation but it is extreme for family as well. In the USA - the agency responsible for the airline industry had the backs of every American when the airlines attempted to do the same. The Dept of transportation (DOT) required airlines to issue refunds. So disappointed that the Canadian Transportation Authority will not require the same. We have enjoyed the direct flights to many destinations through Toronto but will not be flying in the future. We will stick to US flights to ensure we are covered financially should an event to this magnitude occur again. Fellow travelers - Buffalo and Niagara Falls airport is only a little more than an hour away - consider protecting your airline investment in the future by flying through the US! Good luck and stay healthy.

### "flights were excellent"
Not Verified |  This review is not about the airline, aircraft, flight crew, etc. The flights were excellent. It is about Air Transats affiliation with Europcar car rental company. They caused us problems during our 6 week vacation in Portugal plus they are still, almost a month since we returned home, charging our credit card with a $600 unauthorized charge. Also we have been trying to recover our "security deposit" of 300 euros that was promised after the car was returned. They correspond but don't answer questions as to the extra charges on our credit card. I checked the reviews for this company and 89% of the people reviewed gave it the lowest rating possible, many with similar complaints regarding questionable & probably illegal credit card charge transactions.

### "need to work with my travel insurance"
Calgary to Cancun. Extremely dissatisfied with Air Transat regarding their integrity - lack there of. Flew from Calgary to Cancun, checked-in one suitcase. When awaiting my baggage in Cancun, it took a substantial amount of time for the bag to come on the belt. When I finally retrieved my suitcase, I found the lock broken, and items stolen from my bag. I immediately contacted the airline, and was told to wait at least 6 weeks for a response. I received a letter back apologizing, but said I need to work with my travel insurance company for any liability, as stolen items are not covered by the airline. I left my luggage in the care of the airline - and this is what happens. I'm very disappointed in the lack of resolution and lack of seriousness from the airline.

### "Thank you to the crew"
Not Verified |  Lisbon to Toronto. Thank you to the crew operating flight TS 733 on Monday March 16th. Amazing service. Despite the corona virus fears, this crew worked intensely to maintain a positive attitude. We waited for almost 2 hours in the plane upon arrival due to the high number of passengers at Customs. The Captain kept all passengers informed and calm. Thank you !

### "requested Credit for 3 tickets"
I purchased 8 tickets to travel from Vancouver to Cancun in April 2020, due to covid-19 situation three of our company can’t make it. Called Air Transat and explained the situation and requested Credit for 3 tickets, just credit for future tickets not a refund. The answer was no and I had to let $2000 go to waste and told that they can’t to anything. I was expecting a little help in this situation.

### "thanks to Air Transat!"
We flew a very early-morning flight from Toronto to Holguin, Cuba on February 10, 2020. This flight necessitated getting to the airport at about 4 a.m. I had done an on-line check-in and was heading to the airport's luggage check-in (as we have done before) but a staff member directed us to Air Transat's Options Plus check-in counter which had nobody there. The on-line check-in was easy, as it had been on previous Air Transat experiences. Check-in was easy, even though we had four checked-luggage suitcases. We were using Options Plus for the little perks which included first-of-line check-in and extra weight allowance. Our flight, TS0656 left on time and arrived in Holguin on time. Along the way, the flight staff proved friendly and we received the Options Plus goodies for which we had paid upfront. We found our seats, 19H and 19J comfortable and we enjoyed the movie selections. The screen system worked perfectly and watching movies and listening to music helped to pass the time as we flew above the clouds. Our return flight, TS0657 left Frank Pais Airport slightly ahead of schedule, after our having passed through customs to get to the waiting room. Once again, we enjoyed the Options Plus benefits - not counting the extra-weight allowance, because we had only two suitcases on our return trip. Once again, the flight staff were excellent. Our return-flight seats were 18H and 18J and comfortable and the in-flight movie system worked fine. On both trips, the toilets were clean. On both trips, Options Plus allowed us to choose from the menu and enjoy a sandwich and a drink. The sandwiches were fine. I had the "Montreal sliced meat" sandwich and my partner had the turkey sandwich. Both were fine and served the keep-us-going until another meal purpose. At the end of both flights I commended the Air Transat staff for their fine service. But this is something we have grown to expect from Air Transat which we have been using two and three times a year to fly to such places as Europe (mostly Gatwick in London), Cuba (mostly Holguin) and Mexico. I sympathize that some people don't get the same excellent experience that we have had with Air Transat. I was particularly concerned by a review by Alice G., who noted that prepaid and preselected seating was not given to her on a flight. This happened to one of our family members with Air Canada and caused tremendous distress. Air Canada is in the process of buying Air Transat and my hope is that the excellent service we find with Air Transat does not diminish to a lesser standard because of new ownership. In the meantime, thanks to Air Transat!

### "how much alcohol served to a client"
Not Verified |  This is not so much a review but a question if flight attendants have smart serve? Do they communicate between them about how much alcohol is served to a client. I just flew back and was not impressed by the amount a young lady sitting next to me was served of wine bottles and hard liquor. Something that maybe you should be looking into. Really not impressed . I’m in the hospitality business, we are so controlled and then I witness this happening , but may the rules are different in the sky?

### "ran out of the food items"
Rio Hato to Toronto. My husband, 2 friends, and I took a 7 day all inclusive trip to Panama from Toronto. We knew booking this flight that they do not serve food on this airline and that is ok. We planned to buy food on the plane. We waited 3 hours until the stewardess came to us and by this time they ran out of the food items except chips and chocolate. The stewardess did not even apologize. This was by far the worst experience I have ever had with an airline.

### " crew has been absolutely fantastic"
Winnipeg to Puerto Vallarta. I have flown with Air Transat over 6 times now since I have been retired a couple years ago. Air Transat has raised the bar so high choosing any other airline would be a very difficult task. Air Transat customer service right from Checking in to the flight crew has been absolutely fantastic on every flight I have been on. Just wanted to say Thank-You and now that I am retired I am grateful I can now choose the Airline of my choice.

### "no apologies were offered"
Montreal to Toronto. The flight was first delayed for an hour, then for another two due to the broken door. When I called the client service line, no apologies were offered, and certainly no compensation. The girl on the line was straight rude, dismissing my complaints and telling ”AirTransat is not responsible for anything”. The staff was inattentive, pretending they don’t notice me. Overall, one of the worst flying experiences in my life.

### "issue was lack of seat space"
Santa Clara to Toronto. Paid for Options Plus & Seat selection. $298 spent for nothing. Seats only 17" wide. Shoulders on top of each other. I would never fly like this again. Staff were good and very attentive. Our issue was lack of seat space, shoulder space & even the aisles are so small, I had to walk sideways down them.

### "they finished boarding earlier"
Toronto to Fort Lauderdale. I had a flight booked with Air Transat with 2 little kids. The security was very slow and we arrived to the gate 5 minutes before the end of boarding time. Air Transat told me that they finished boarding earlier and took me off the list, and they are allowed to do it because they notify the passengers to be at the gate 60 minutes ahead and we weren’t there 60 minutes ahead. They escorted us outside, while the kids are crying about their lost vacation that they were dreaming about for months.

### "not be travelling with them again"
Ft Lauderdale to Montreal. Just checked in to my flight which allows one carry on and one handbag. My carry on is a super light 21 inch bag. Despite this i was forced to check it in. This will add 30 to 45 minutes to my trip on arrival. If you’re on a tight schedule and travel with a light carry on be aware you will be asked to check it in on Transat. Will not be travelling with them again, and I’m a very frequent traveller.

### "on the tarmac for over an hour"
Toronto to Vancouver. Left Toronto an hour late, but landed in Vancouver fairly close to our arrival time of 10:30 am. Stuck on the tarmac for over an hour, finally moved the plane over to another gate and de-planed. Two hours after de-planing my bag has yet to make it down to the baggage carousel. I'm not alone, they managed to offload about half the bags an hour ago, but nothing since.

### "All around disappointment"
Toronto to Cancun. All around disappointment 2 and half hours late with no explanation. The plane had no food/snacks on it the representative at the resort (Moon Palace) was more interested in trying to sell us some dinners and other garbage then actually answering our questions all in all will never fly with this joke of an airline again.

### "Back was turned on me. No follow up"
Not Verified |  Glasgow to Toronto with Air Transat. The Attendant Call Button has to be pressed as water was streaming down from the air conditioning unit. I understand during landing it is not possible, however, on landing the call button was outrightly ignored. On disembarkation I asked if the Attendant would like to know why the Flight Button was called. Attendant held hand up to my face and said it was a leaking air conditioning unit. Back was turned on me. No follow up. I was soaked. No customer safety demonstrated.

### "the icing on the cake"
Toronto to Cancun. You often hear of negative stories when it comes to airlines despite the fact that they have to manage thousands of travelers in the course of a day with few problems arising. I’d like to share an absolutely great news story that really shows how above and beyond Air Transat was in helping my family out when we were in dire straights and had given up hope. On Friday, January 3rd, my wife, 2 kids, a 9-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son, were supposed to be going to Mexico for a week vacation. We arrived at the airport, went through the self serve check-in terminals to get our baggage tags and then moved on to the luggage drop off. Following luggage drop off, I realized that we were missing our passports and our other travel documents. We became very worried when we couldn’t find them following a scan of the nearby area. We had lost our passports between baggage tag check-in and baggage drop off. A short distance traveled - how could this be possible? I asked several of the Air Transat staff in the area for help. They alerted all staff that if they found something to let us know. They also had a few people search with me around the area. Tracing our steps, we remembered that we had taken off our jackets and packed them in our luggage prior to luggage drop off. Were the documents in our luggage, packed with our jackets? Air Transat employees contacted the gate who worked with the ground crew at retrieving our luggage as we rushed to the gate to open them up praying that our passports were there. We were very close to missing our flight. We opened the luggage, and nothing was there. I decided to leave the family at the gate and go back to the check-in to see if there was any progress. With a very helpful employee that saw me in distress, we checked in all the garbage, under the check-in machines, on the conveyor belts at the check-in station. The passports and documents were gone. And we had missed our flight. At that point, I thanked the staff, realizing that our Mexican holiday needed to be postponed. We got in the car on the way home children crying, and both my wife and I very stressed. We started making plans at rushing to take passport pictures, go to the passport office and pay for expedient service and hoping we can save at least part of our trip. The raw emotions of anger, despair, exhaustion and self-doubt were unbearable. On the way home I received a text from one of the staff. They had found one of the 4 passports. I couldn’t believe it! I then got a call about 10 minutes later. They had found 2 more! They had sent the Airport staff to go and inspect the length of the conveyor belt within the airport where the luggage’s traveled. Even though we had left the airport they didn't stop looking. We got home with fingers crossed. If they could only find the last one the trip may be saved. We got the call. They had found the 4th passport. They had to check every crevice around the conveyor belts which travel for several kilometres within the airport. They actually had to have someone climb into a few tunnel-like areas to get into some sections. We were so grateful and was going to call our travel agent to book us on the next available flight. Air Transat staff said we shouldn’t worry about that. The next flight out was at 4.30 that evening, and they can rebook us on that flight directly with no cost to us. This was the icing on the cake.

### "Very disappointing"
Not Verified |  Puerto Vallarta to Vancouver with Air Transat. Nice plane and flight crew, but flight departed 2 hrs late and once arrived had to wait over an hour for bags, with explanation. Very disappointing.

### "Service was very slow"
Service from Toronto to Punta Cana was excellent. Punta Cana to Toronto was not as good. Service was very slow for drinks and food. We were a party of 2. My food was cold and asked to reheat, 20 minutes later, flight director brought my food but my partner was already finished. I told her it’s too late now and had mentioned service was really slow, there was only 12 seats? She said , well it takes time to reheat food and the steward was new with little experience, then why is she doing Club Class. I found the Director very rude and didn’t care. I love Air Transat over other airlines and I hope this is a one off. This was a Christmas present to my partner to be in Club Class, not cheap! The resort we stayed at Be Live All Adult was terrible for 2 weeks and then we get more of the same coming home. Disappointing!

### "seat spacing is so small"
Ottawa to Cayo Coco. This is my first review I have done for an airline. The seat spacing (seat pitch 32 inches) on this Boeing 737-800 is so small I can barely move. I would never take a trip with this airline.

### "The staff were excellent"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Rome. I found Air Transat to be a great airline. The airplane was nice with purple lighting after everyone settled down. The seat space was comfortable. The staff were excellent. I required extra help and they were efficient, kind and discreet. Keep up the great work. I will fly Air Transat again.

### "crew were so genuine"
Gatwick to Toronto. Was served a meal with drinks and then half hour again drinks from the cart then another hour after that Hot snacks with bar drinks and finally sweets before landing. The crew were so genuine and smiled. They were so tolerant with this kid who was always in their way.

### "I paid for one carry on"
Gatwick to Toronto. I paid for a ticket for one carry on, and the site says a carry on up to 10kg is free. My carry on was less than 10kg, but staff asked to put my other item on the scale to put it over. They said one of the items needs to be discarded or I have to pay £50.

### "Air Transat met and exceeded"
I flew from Gatwick to Toronto return on Air Transat's new A321neoLR aircraft. Given the price I paid (under £400 return) my expectations were modest - to get there on time, in a clean aircraft and with friendy staff. Air Transat met and exceeded all that. The plane was brand new, in fact the cabin attendants told me that the plane had only been in service on that route for a few weeks. There was a small meal with free drinks provided in both directions with a small snack on arrival - better than on WestJet economy for the same route. The IFE system is not as extensive as say, Emirates, but there is enough to keep you occupied. You do need to bring your own earphones, or else Air Transat will sell you some, ditto a blanket. On the way over I paid extra for an emergency exit row, while on the way back I had a standard seat. However even this was perfectly fine and the seat pitch is probably slightly better than what you'll find on BA. The one thing that may not be to everyone's tastes is flying a single aisle aircraft over the Atlantic. This is something that's becoming more common, and though the plane didn't feel cramped as such, it did make for congestion in the aisle when passengers were waiting for the WC and the crew were pushing a trolley down it. However all in all, would recommend Air Transat and would fly them again on the same route.

### "transferred to flight one day earlier"
Not Verified |  I have not even flown with this airline yet and my impressions are not to be desired. Booked my flights in August, got an email in the September to say there was a sale on and thought I’d see the price of my fare now. Quite surprisingly, my dates were no longer shown as a scheduled flight. I contact AT by messenger and was reassured that my flight was still honoured and no changes had been made. I wrote to them again a week later and got a response advising me that both my flights had been cancelled. I had to wait another week to reschedule my whole trip, as after an hour on the phone to customer services, I was told the options hadn’t been loaded for the cancelled pax yet. A week later, and at a cost of £250 extra for  my hotel and other flight changes, I was transferred on to a flight one day earlier both outbound and inbound. AT advised that they wouldn’t be providing compensation for this change as they didn’t deem it appropriate. I now can’t login to my reservation and have been told that I can make a seat selection in the next 4 or 5 months, yet I was able to select a seat on my original flight, a day later, as soon as it was booked? Overall, messages from this company are confusing, they don’t sing off the same hymn sheet, and before I’ve even flown with them, I will never choose them again.

### "costs $85 dollars a bag"
Glasgow to Toronto on economy budget ticket. Traveling with my wife and only have two under weight carry-ons, nothing else. This airline has a metal cage they have you put your luggage in and it is too small to fit standard carry on. So oh well they said it’s too big you must buy two 23kg check luggage or basically you don’t fly today. The dimensions match what is on their site. So what does it cost to just put your carry on below instead of overhead bins where they will fit? It costs $85 dollars a bag just to put below. When I arrived in Toronto on the 18th I went straight to Air Transat check in to resolve problem but supervisors could not help but were surprised I was charged to check in at Scotland as the two bags fit under their cardboard box they use. As for the flight not cheap $500 one way have flown much cheaper to Europe on Air France. The flight attendants were not friendly to me except for one man who was good at his job and made the clearest announcements . Food is a joke more like TV dinner for kids, they charge for a blanket.

### " My love affair with Air Transat continues"
London to Toronto. My love affair with Air Transat continues. Clean plane, great cabin service for a full flight, reasonably comfortable seats, really good entertainment system, pretty good airline food and great price. Flight was 15 minutes late leaving a congested Gatwick and arrived 15 minutes late in Toronto. I have flown Air Transat many times to various destinations and have never had a problem.

### "super crew and incredible price"
Toronto to Gatwick. Cannot say enough good things. Easy check in, on time flight, clean aircraft, super crew and incredible price. Food was really good for a discount airline meal.

### "1/2 hour to get my boarding pass"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Toronto. My suggestion is they install a boarding pass machine at Schiphol for those who do not have baggage to check in Waited in line 1/2 hour to get my boarding pass from staff as opposed to from a“machine. So did a lot of other people. For most other airlines at Schiphol you use a machine.

### Air Transat customer review
Not Verified |  London Gatwick to Toronto with Air Transat. Thought outbound flight and service was bad until return leg. Staff aggressive, hostile, abrupt. Food, should I call it food, no. My leg was tucked in, not in the way of the aisle however seven hits later they finally managed to jam the door of the trolley into my leg brace breaking one of the straps. Oh and a point of security, found an iPad in the back seat pocket, told staff who did not seem to care, said they had searched the plane but obviously not. Have traveled countless airlines all over the globe and the only positive thing I can say is we landed safely. Never ever again, pay more go with someone else.

### "I really appreciated this trip"
Montréal to Toulouse. Very smooth flight with Air Transat. The take off was delayed by 20 minutes but we arrived on time at destination. The crew was very professional and always smiling. Two choices for the meal, I tried both and I can say that, without being the greatest food I've ever eaten, it was totally satisfying talking about the taste. Maybe a little bit more in quantity would have been better but it was ok. We also had a little snack about an hour before landing. The entertainment system on board was good : the touch screen was quickly responding, the interface was easy to understand and the movie quantity and quality were honest. The cabin + toilets were clean, the seats were not very large but quite comfy, the leg room space was correct. To be honest, the 6h45 flight felt quick, I really appreciated this trip.

### "carry on bag a few kg overweight"
Vancouver to Gatwick. Do not be tempted by cheap flights. They will charge baggage fees without consistency. Air Transat charged 85CAD for a carry on bag a few kg overweight.

### "Do not recommend"
Montreal to Toronto delayed by 2hr 23 mins. Worst flight experience. We kept being delayed for the most unprofessional reasons. Cabin crew kept being evasive about the new schedule of the flight. Do not recommend.

### "Do not buy option plus"
Amsterdam to Toronto. Booked an economy ticket and purchased options plus at $99 per leg so total $198. This should have given me one extra bag so total of 2 checked bags. Premium seat choice, a care kit, extra snack and drinks on board and priority boarding. It did not. I received a small discount on buying a seat, I did not get an extra bag and my 2nd bag cost me $100 each way, I did get a snack did not get wine other than one at the meal which everyone got. Do not buy option plus. Absolute waste of money. I effectively paid $200 for a box of Pringles.

### "blatant price gouging"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Barcelona via Toronto. I am appalled at the blatant price gouging of customers that Air Transat has chosen to undertake. Never in all my years of travelling internationally have I had to pay baggage fees! Do they honestly expect people to travel to Europe for two weeks just using a carry on luggage? Really? And I don't understand how they are rated as the best leisure travel airline. The service was nothing to write home about, the food was horrible. Most flights offer their passengers both dinner and breakfast when flying to Europe. Dinner was served but breakfast consisted of a slice of marble cake. Really? And there were no other options available! An additional cost of $200 was added to my already expensive economy flight which cost me $1400.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Not Verified |  London Gatwick to Vancouver. After not flying long haul for a considerable number of years and reading lot's of reviews I had resigned myself to a long uncomfortable experience. I was pleasantly surprised. The check in experience at both ends was quick and efficient. Whilst the leg room wasn't overly generous (my husband is 6ft 2) it was adequate. Both departure and return were smooth flights. The food I found to be quite tasty with plenty of drinks. We had registered our daughter with the kids club which she received extra snacks, goody bag and priority baggage. The staff were polite and plenty of in flight entertainment choice. I wouldn't hesitate to book with the airline again.

### "thoroughly recommend"
Not Verified | Calgary to London Gatwick. I flew with Air Transat on a long eight-hour flight, some of which was during the night. They had comfortable mood lighting but when it was dark out they dimmed the lights. They came around frequently with drinks and food and their duty-free selection. I thoroughly recommend this airline if you are flying transatlantic from Europe. I am looking forward to flying on them again.

### "flight was really great2
Not Verified |  On July 22, 2019 I was on board an Air Transat Boeing 737-700 from Montreal YUL to Toronto YYZ! This short 1 hour hop between the 2 largest cities in Canada was overall, a very enjoyable trip! Since check in was already completed 24 hours prior to takeoff online, all we had to do once we arrived into the departures section of the airport was to check in via the electronic check-in kiosks and print out our boarding tickets. You can actually skip this step too but since I am a trip reviewer, I always prefer to obtain a physical copy of my boarding ticket as it looks great and offers as a collectable for myself to take. After boarding the aircraft via Gate A17, which is a remote gate on the lower level, I was pleased to confirm that my exit row seat, 13K was as I expected. There was no seat in front of me and I had ample legroom because of this. However, there was a very big downside and that was that my seat belt was actually covered in gum! That was really off putting and made my entire buckle sticky. Other than that, the seat itself was nice, the legroom for me was really great, and the flight crew were friendly. Departure was only delayed slightly and we arrived quite on time, maybe delayed like 5 min but that is very little and we all know there are many long delays out there in the world of aviation. There was a short drink service free of charge and I got a cup of apple juice which tasted good, and soon enough we arrived to YYZ. Overall, the flight was really great, and the only disappointing thing about it was really the fact that my seat belt was full of gum and made it very dirty. But the seat itself and the cabin were very acceptable to me. Overall, I truly had a good flight and Air Transat is a fair airline!

### "bad experience"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight for myself and my husband from Toronto to Barcelona from 8/2/19 to 8/11/19, due to medical emergency my husband was not allowed to travel. I submitted all medical documents to cancel my flights and get my refund about 2-3 weeks prior to our travel. Air Transat customer service was terrible, just robotic answers. They were not understanding my emergency situation and instead of helping me, they were very rude. Finally, after 12 weeks of waiting time, their answer was no. Even though I requested about a voucher, partial refund. I guess most of the airlines have some margin in a real case of emergency but the bottom line is I will never ever travel on Air Transat and will tell my whole circle and fiends about my bad experience.

### "consider the flights to be acceptable"
In Summer 2019 I flew a return flight with Air Transat from Gatwick to Montréal. The outbound flight was late by 1:30 due to the inbound aircraft being late, not much they could do. However when we entered the plane it was like entering an oven as there was no air conditioning. Subsequently we were left to melt for about 40 minutes before push back and take-off. The aircraft was very old. There was no in-seat entertainment, that was all by overhead screens which you had to purchase a set of earphones onboard for. I heard they they plan on retiring their A310-300's at the start of 2020. The seats were a little dirty and well used, although legroom and seat width were perfectly acceptable for me (I am 6'1"). The meal service for lunch was good, I chose the pasta option and was pleased with my choice. The cabin crew were very attentive throughout the flight and made conversation about where we were staying and what we were doing in Canada. Overall the outbound leg was average. On the return flight from Montréal to Gatwick, we left on time. The aircraft was even older and did not even have a personal air conditioning vent. As it was the same type of aircraft, the layout was the same as was the inflight entertainment. The flight was not full, so myself and the other person in my row had a seat between us, which allowed for a little bit more legroom and we could raise the armrests to sleep better. The meal option was somewhat lacking for a dinner, and so was breakfast which consisted of a slice of vanilla cake. The cabin crew on this return flight did not seem as interested as the outbound leg, which is a shame. Overall, I would consider the flights to be acceptable due to Air Transat being a budget airline. Once the older aircraft (the A310's are nearly 30 years old!) are replaced by newer ones the flights will definitely be better.

### "plane was delayed by 1 day"
Our plane was delayed by 1 day. I had to miss a day of work. Other people at the airport booked flights with WestJet and Flair because they were taking off. Our flight had mechanical issues. We were given a $20 food voucher, but that was after 3 hours of waiting at the airport. Then after 5 hours of waiting we learn that the flight is cancelled. We were given hotel rooms and a $15 food voucher for the hotel (not enough really). The next morning the flight was to leave at 12 noon, but it is delayed again to 2pm. We finally get a new plane. The air crew was so nice and helpful. At the end of this, Air Transat did give us a credit for a future flight. Better than Flair Airlines.

### "little effort to resolve the issue"
Not Verified |  I had a lost piece of luggage, Air Transat were not very sympathetic at the airport, and were difficult to get any kind of assurance from. They seem to pass the buck. They give no guidance on replacement cover or update on luggage location and the Web tracking service is not great as they do not provide a tracking number that fits their Web requirement. Why can you not use the luggage number applied at the airport? Live Chat functionality on their website seems like a sales line, and not a lot of assistance. If they can't answer your questions it appears you get cut off. Very little effort to resolve the issue.

### "no provision for emergencies"
Amsterdam to Toronto. I told the team I had a medical emergency and needed to get home. The supervisor said that she can't be do anything and she could not help me get to my mother in hospital. There is no provision for emergencies. You're on your own. I am disgusted with the lack of customer service.

### "a very positive experience"
Gatwick to Montreal. There are many reviews on this site which are very negative about Air Transat. My Director travelled on Air Transat and had a very positive experience. He is a frequent Business traveller and advised that Air Transat's Club cabin was probably superior to Premium Economy on BA or anyone elseat half the cost!

### "we could not sit together"
Toronto to Puerto Plata. My boyfriend and I took a vacation to Puerta Plata recently, we decided to fly Air Transat and sadly things went wrong. On our return home, we asked if we could sit beside each other but were told that we could not sit together by two different personnel because there were no seats side by side. After the plane was loaded and everyone was seated, I used the restroom and it came to my attention that there were two seats side by side. Not only were we told we couldn't sit together they lied. Once  in my seat (20A) I noticed that my seat was broken and would not sit up straight causing me to have a uncomfortable ride home. The stewardess kept reminding me to bring my seat back up to the up right position which was not possible. She was informed by myself personally and wouldn't let me sit in another seat available. After sitting in a broken seat for a few hours the stewardess were offering compliment beverages but because we had some turbulence they told our section that they would return when it was safe. After about three hours into the flight, the stewardess never returned with beverages so we had to ask for them.

### "a sensational flight"
Not Verified |  A310-300 from Toronto to Montreal. A one way ticket from Toronto to Montreal can go for as low as $76 CAD! The flight time was around 51 minutes and it was thoroughly enjoyable. I am a trip reporter and I have waited months to fly on an A310, so it was an exciting moment for myself. At the Toronto Terminal 3, check in was smooth as I was travelling without checked luggage and was checked in online. After using the kiosk to print tickets, we were headed off to and through security is 7 minutes. Boarding began around 1 hour prior to departure, my seat was 27K. It had enormous legroom for an economy class seat, and I was able to stretch out. The A310 might look cramped, but it was good enough for me! The mood lighting in the cabin was an extra treat. Although there was no WIFI or IFE Screens, it was not an issue as the flight was only a short domestic hop. We took off 10 minutes behind schedule, but we made up for the time in the air. The cabin crew were delightful and served us drinks. We arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule but had to wait another 30 minutes for a gate, thus rendering us behind schedule when exiting the aircraft. I even got to visit the cockpit and the cabin and cockpit crew were more than nice! All in all, it was a sensational flight and I loved the A310 and the airline.

### "Excellent flights on Air Transat"
Toronto to Dublin. Excellent flights on Air Transat. Flight left on time in both directions. When you choose option plus, you get a complimentary beverage and snack with your fare. I choose to sit forward of the wing, as it is less bumpy during turbulence. Seat is comfortable but snug, leg room needs improvement. Flight Attendants were awesome, friendly and professional and safety was enforced through out the flight. Food was delicious with hot entrees actually hot and tasty. Choose to add the Air Transat app on line before you fly, you need to remember your aircraft type when you download the app. The aircraft type is on the booking page. Connect free of charge to Air Transat wifi on your cell phone or tablet, there are also screen in the cabin to watch the movies, but you need compatible ear phones to listen. Air Transat needs to increase their Club Class seating, it’s worth the extra cash to fly in a bigger seat in a two by two configuration. I enjoyed my time on board and will fly Air Transat, Trans- Atlantic flights again, but in Club Class -  any flight over 4 hrs needs to be in Club Class. On the down side, they need to get rid of the A310-300. It’s very old and super crowded. Air Transat is worth looking onto. Take your time when you book, choose your flight times accordingly and your seat selection. It’s worth the extra money to guarantee your individual seats.

### "stay away from Air Transat"
❎ Not Verified | Toronto to Venice via Montreal. Flight from Montreal to Venice was delayed for 3 hours, we were left on the tarmac with no air con, no food but access to the toilets. Cabin crew disappeared and were nowhere to be found, I had to look for cups and water, which I poured for myself and several other passengers - felt like I was working harder than the cabin crew! Cannot fault Air Transat for the delay due to weather, but can fault them for not a least trying to make the delay a bit comfortable by keeping the aircon on and offering refreshments. Flight from Venice to Toronto was the worst I have ever experienced. The plane was dirty and in general, poor shape. Booked and paid extra for better seats which we did not get. The cabin crew was unhelpful and actually made the situation worse by their total lack of concern. I later found them sitting in the back braiding each other's hair and giggling like schoolgirls, they were also using some type of acetone nail polish remover on each other, which made things more unpleasant as the stink of it in an enclosed area of the plane was bad. The flight director was rude and offered no assistance to our seat issue. She actually inflamed the situation by her general rude demeanour and lack of concern - there was no customer service to speak of for her nor the crew. Follow up later with Air Transat took three phone calls, two emails and a webchat in order to receive a refund (not posted to our visa yet, so we will remain hopeful that it will actually be processed). I would seriously warn anyone with any medical issues and/or small children to stay away from Air Transat. The lower price may be appealing, however, you will pay in other ways. You may no receive your upgraded seats, and there really is no one to help you, either on the ground and via the customer relations line, if you need assistance.

### "Chef meal was awful"
❎ Not Verified | Toronto to Rome. The Vezina Chef meal was awful. Presented still wrapped in its tinfoil which left me to deal with unwrapping it and the resulting condensation. Unappealing appearance and substandard quality given the hype and the 25.00 price tag. Served with warm white wine and delivered 20 minutes ahead of that of my travelling companion who had no meal "option" within his Option Plus purchased extra. Most passengers received their beverages well after their meal was consumed. The Chef meal did not contain the items advertised then and still shown today. Stale marble cake delivered as breakfast again without hot or cold beverage until well after. Air Transat is sorry that I didn't enjoy my meal. Still shaking my head over that one.

### "imbalance of vegetarian and chicken meals"
I flew the A330-300 between Toronto and Manchester for a holiday. The seats were comfortable with my expectations being met regarding the lack of legroom for a budget level airline. The online check in service was quick and easy with free seat alterations. Air Transat sent a reminder through for the eTa service, needed for foreign nationals to enter Canada which was a nice touch. Due to all of this the interactions with ground staff was limited on both the outward and return legs but what interaction I did have was positive. On the flight the screen was clear but the selection of TV shows and films was limited but that didn't really bother me. The meal service was a tad slow to come out and work itself down the plane which did affect the amount of sleep time on the overnight return flight. The main gripe with the meal was that I requested a Lactose Free Meal but this wasn't adhered to. This lead to mild discomfort on a 7 hour flight. The other glaring error that was the imbalance of vegetarian and chicken meals leading to those at the back of the plane not having a full choice. The cabin crew were appologetic about this and were more attentive after it. Overall, the flight was good but better organisation behind the scenes could have prevented my major gripe.

### "never flying air Transat again"
Montréal to Toronto. Horrible experience. Wasn’t able to check into my flight due to their website not working, and then tried to change it as I had a personal emergency (that came up a few hours before flight). I was transferred from department to department for over an hour, and ended up going to airport to check as they weren’t giving me an answer. At the airport the kiosk didn’t work, and I had to join the massive line to check in. By the time I got there it was 55 minutes until flight and check in was closed. The only reason I was late was because their check in service didn’t work, and they kept me on the phone for over an hour knowing when my flight was. After trying to explain my circumstance, they finally hung up on me. Horrible customer service I can’t believe they would hang up on a customer trying to find a solution to the problem they caused in the first place. Will never be flying air Transat again.

### "chartered out to Canadian North"
Booked a package thru Air Transat for June 2019 travel. To/From Vancouver and Puerto Vallarta June 15-23. Air Transat chartered out the flight to Canadian North. They did the same with my flight June 2018. Don’t be worried if this happens to your fight! Canadian North are the nicest ever flight crew and all my experiences with them have been positive. Yes it’s an older plane, but wasn’t that loud and kept clean. Food on board is the same as Air Transat’s bistro menu. However, be informed they limit quantities on what they offer. I’m not talking about 50 of an item for an entire plane. I selected the chicken and orzo dish and then the person next me asked to order it too, and the flight attendants said they are only given one (1) of that item for each flight. One for the flight to Puerto Vallarta. One for the flight back to YVR. Stunned. it was the best ever charter airline meal I ever ate! Air Transat should seriously consider increasing the quantity. I purchased the Options Plus package. First time doing that. Enjoyed having the rolled blanket in the drawstring nylon bag, and it was a great back arch support for my flights. Never took it out of the bag but inside apparently is also the inflatable neck pillow and eye mask. Options Plus is supposed to include priority baggage, but at check in at YVR the agent did not place any tag of such on my suitcase. My suitcase was one of the last to come out on the baggage carousel at Puerto Vallarta. On the way home, the agent at Puerto Vallarta airport did put the priority tag on my suitcase, but didn’t seem to help much as about 40 bags came out at YVR (some with Priority tags and most without) before my priority tagged bag came out on the carousel. In-flight entertainment limited, they had drop down TVs every 5 or 6 rows, and you could load the app on your cell, but never am impressed with options. Would rather read a book or listen to my own music on their flights. Once again, their flight crews on Canadian North are amazing. For my return flight, I had pre-ordered and paid for a gourmet meal. (Wasn’t a fan of the bistro options that would come with the Options Plus) Its advertised “main dish served with cheese, dessert and wine”. My meal of “Pork filet mignon with Quebec blueberries” was tasty, and came with dessert and wine, but no cheese. Instead of the cheese, they included seasonless plain Tabouleh in a small dish with 1 olive. Not only do I dislike Tabouleh but completely plain tabbouleh. There was no notation I found on their website they may swap their advertised items with something else. It only says “presentations may vary” and doesn’t stay a completely different item will be used. Overall I was pleased with the tastes and quality of the Pork served. I suggest to Air Transat they enforce passengers’ carry on luggage. Numerous passengers carried on suitcases that clearly were over the measurements allowed, some having to be put sideways in the overhead bins and take up most of the space. Not fair to other passengers. This is not a one-time thing, but happens on many of my Transat flights, however, this flight was extreme in the amount allowed on, even with the cardboard box example at the gate. If your suitcase does not fit to easily roll down the aisle then clearly it is oversized and should be checked. Gate agents were even making announcements on both flights down and back that the flight is full and limited space, and were encouraging people to check their carry on bags,

### "check in our carryon luggage"
Montreal to Vancouver. They forced us to check in our carryon luggage, which was fine for other airlines in my trips. And we can not take it back at the door, it goes to the baggage belt. Also, the staff was rudely saying it is not allowed, though during the broadcast she says volunteered to check in.

### "flight staff are always congenial"
Montreal to Rome. I will always choose Air Transat for flights overseas. Their prices are lower than the competition and their flight staff are always congenial. The food served is edible and the entertainment selection is fine (although it could be changed more frequently).

### "crews are friendly and humorous"
My experience flying with Air Transat on an 8 hour flight from Gatwick to Toronto was okay. Ground service at Gatwick Airport was quick. They seem to be a little stringent on both personal item and carry-on weight. Departing gate is not posted on your ticket. You must wait and attach your head on the Airport’s Departure Screen to find out the exact location of your gate. Cabin crews are friendly and humorous. Snacks and liquor must be purchased individually. Complementary meal was good and well done. In-flight entertainment was a bit of a let down due to commercials and limited library content. However, the screen looks crisp and responsive! In addition, theres no wifi available in the plane. In terms of ticket price, it was affordable vs other airlines with the same route. I will fly again.

### "Very impressed with this airline"
Montreal to Varadero. Very impressed with this airline. The only critique was the lack of personal interaction during check in at Montreal. Plenty of staff just standing there watching us struggle. I fly quite often and there is always someone standing by to help attach those impossible labels on the bags. Actual drop off was also automated and we had no means to label our bags priority as we had paid for Option Plus. The system should at least provide a means for priority pax to get a priority sticker for their bags. That is where negative criticism ends. From then on the flights were flawless. We had exit row seats which were provided both ways, and automatically changed when aircraft configuration did. Service was exemplary both ways. My traveling companion first language is French and mine is English and we were cheerfully and flawlessly served in both languages. We paid extra for proper meals as we knew our arrival times precluded getting a decent meal upon arrival. These meals were surprisingly good and of a high quality and served with proper metal cutlery. One flight attendant named Sharon needs to be singled out for her friendly, professional and knowledgeable service. She made our flight. Aircraft were clean and well kept. We would have liked more in the way of info from the flight deck as there was no IFE system to provide this. That is forthcoming on these recently acquired aircraft which Air Transat plans to retrofit. I love Air Transat and look forward to flying them again.

### "not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  I booked Club Class tickets from Calgary to London in July 2018 for departure May 3, 2019 – 10 months in advance. One month prior to our departure I received an email advising a change of flight schedule now departing May 3 Calgary to Vancouver then to London. I called to confirm Club Class seat selections and was on the phone for 1 hour 40 minutes. I received an email at 7:19 a.m. confirming Club Class seats for the Vancouver to London Flight. Six hours later I received another email advising the Club Class seat reservation from Vancouver to London would not be honoured. We have flown Air Transat numerous times to Mexico and Europe without incident. Air Transat has always been our first airline choice because of the Club Class seats. I cannot express my disappointment and shock when I received the email advising Air Transat would not honour our Club Class seats. I had no choice but to cancel our booking and attempt to book tickets on another airline in Premium Economy. Because we were less than 1 month from our departure date airline fares were much higher than when I originally booked 10 months prior with Air Transat. I emailed Air Transat’s Customer Service Department 7 weeks ago and have never received a reply. I will not recommend this airline.

### "No customer service"
❎ Not Verified | No customer service. I booked a flight to Rome (departure from Montréal) and made an error in the departing date. Called Transat 4 days later when I realized my mistake, there is nothing they can do. There are still plenty of places on both of the flights, same price for both, but they won't change anything. We offered to pay more to exchange the dates, event to upgrade our tickets (which would mean 400$ more!) and they won't accept anything. We need to throw away this ticket and buy a new one if we want to change dates. I've never seen another airline with such horrible service. Once Air Transat get your money, they won't give you any help after.

### "I have to pay for the bag"
Gatwick to Toronto. This is the last time I will fly Air Transat. I was told while checking in I have to pay for the bag I was checking in. It was 60£. Upon arriving at the airport I had to weigh my carry on and purse at the same time. You can only have 10kg in all hand luggage so I had to also check the carry on and pay an extra 65£.

### "flight was delayed for 8 hours"
Not Verified |  I just flew from Toronto to Santa Clara (Cuba) and i had the worst experience ever. Flying from Toronto, flight was delayed for 8 hours and was never posted online until we checked-in in the airport and had to stay in the airport for 6 hours. They gave us $20 voucher for breakfast and $100 off next flight which i will never use because I’m not planning to travel with Air Transat again. After 6 hours delay, we finally got in the airplane and had to wait another 2 hours in the plain cause they had technical issues. In total flight had 8 hours delay and with all this time waiting, they didn’t even offer a free snack in the airplane. Returning back from Santa Clara, flight had 1 hour 20 min delay again due to technical issues and this time they didn’t even bother apologizing for once.

### "denied my cat onto the plane"
I was planned to travel with an animal, a 3 month old rescue kitten I had acquired on my trip there. i researched everything we needed to have and paid the $50 add on fee for animals in cabin, we had all the requirements. My cat's documents put her birthday on the lower end of her possible age in order to help up cross the border of Canada. We put her birthday as 2 months when she really was a 3 month cat, Obviously this caused complications at the check in counter since air transat requires animals to be 12 weeks in age, I tried to reason with the clerk to say that the age was an estimation and that indeed she was within the age to fly, Yet she was denied. Realizing that the airline needed documents confirming her 12 week age, my husband and I ran as fast as we could to another veterinarian clinic and got brand new health certificates, the vet inspected her and and verified her 3 month age, we got a rabies vaccine and returned as fast as we could to the airport. This is where I absolutely can not believe was happened next. The manager for the Puerta Vallarta representative team of Air Transat denied my cat onto the plane again with no reason. She had all documentation that was necessary for the politics of the airline and for us. All bases were covered, we presented all necessary documents and there was absolutely no reason for her to be denied to travel. I am absolutely sickened at the lack of respect Air transat has for their flyers. My cat is now in the hands of someone I was lucky enough to run into who can care for the cat temporarily until I figure out how to get her back into Canada, It has costed us stress and money that we were not prepared to spend.

### "filed a complaint about delay"
Arriving at the Fort Lauderdale airport at 9am for a 12:20pm departure to Toronto, I noted that the departure time had been changed to 12:30pm. An hour later it was changed to 9pm and we were told that when the crew arrived at Fort Lauderdale they would need an 8 hr rest period and for us not to leave the area. We did not board the plane until after 10pm and were told by the pilot that a specialist mechanic was needed to fix a part in Montreal but when the flight arrived at Fort Lauderdale they needed their rest period. When we finally boarded were told that there would be no food, just water and other beverages could be purchased. During the wait we were given lunch and dinner vouchers but a number of places would not accept them. The lineups for the two restaurants in the departure section were extremely long and elderly passengers such as myself were not physically able to stand that long. We therefore had access only to the sandwich kiosks and the wraps that were sold. The staff at the departure gate did nothing and it was up to travelers to continually line up to get vouchers or information as the staff talked about their manicures and plans for the evening etc. This delay was due to a lack of any organization to scheduling. It was known well in advance that the delay in Montreal would result in a requirement for a new crew, or the need for the assigned crew to have a rest stop. I filed a complaint about the delay however while there is a timeframe of at least a month to answer, there is no maximum time period noted within which this needs to be resolved. I accept that this is a budget airline with whom I have flown many times and will probably continue to do so, however, this lack of any acknowledgement as to the obvious rhetoric in their passenger service manifest and the lack of motivation to ensure a positive resolution for both myself and their airline is the reason for this review which is based solely on this trip and the management of the situation.

### "I was refused to check in"
Today, while trying to check in my bags I was refused to check in as the service person said there was a damage on my passport, the ink was peeling and it's like an accident, it can happen, if you spill water or something, you cannot get a passport replaced in 30 min! I had other documents with me to prove I am who I am. Air Transat didn't let me get on board and would not allow me to get to Mexico for the holiday. I bought through Expedia a package and the tickets for my husband and I were over $1600. We could not get into the airplane and now I tried to contact you over the phone and you don't want to refund me or give me a credit for a flight you did not allow me to get in. And I am not even adding that I paid extra for seats and check 1 bag. I don't have extra $ to just throw away and you are keeping my money for a service you didn't allow me to use for no fair reason. Air Transat is not immigration and should not refuse me to get on board for such reason.

### "told my bag was too big"
Fort Lauderdale to Toronto. I flew to fort Lauderdale on April 12th with no issues or problems but when I was leaving on April 16th 2019 it was horrible. I traveled with one carry on bag and and they said the flight was full and asked if anyone wanted to check their carry on bag for free they can. I volunteered but when I got to the gate counter I was told my bag was too big and that they will have to speak to the supervisor about it. When she arrived (myriam), the supervisor said I had to pay. I must say this experience was a eye opener and I wont fly with them again

### "can’t sit where I wanted"
Edmonton to Toronto. I paid for seat selection for aisle 15 a and b. One day before the flight they sent me a email stating they moved me to 28. When I called the said that someone was in my window seat on 15 so I decided to stay with 28. As I boarded they said I had no choice but had to move as I had a cane. My mobility was not that compromised so I was offended and said I paid for more leg room. I had no choice and got moved to a terrible seat. With a possible option of a refund. I got that seat for a reason now I can’t sit where I wanted. Terrible company

### Air Transat customer review
Calgary to Toronto. Had read a lot of reviews on Air Transat at couple of different places and had kind of high hopes from the airline. Was sadly surprised to note the poor state of the aircraft and ground staff members. The staff took forever to begin their check-in counters, to begin the bad experiences that followed. And very cramped seats to make all hopes disappear. Cheap for a reason. Hope not to fly the airline again.

### "courteous and friendly"
Not Verified |  Great service. Staff were beyond polite, courteous and friendly. Only airline on time from Cayo Coco to Ottawa. The Captains of the plane were very good and kept us up to date about both flights.

### "no outlet to plug my phone into"
Not Verified |  Toronto to London Gatwick. I’m usually pretty prepared for flights, I board and see that there’s no tv which is no biggie because being prepared as I usually am I had downloaded lots of games, movies, and music to my phone. So you can imagine my horror after realizing that not only was there not a tv but no outlet to plug my phone into, meaning I wouldn’t be able to use my phone the entire flight to save the battery for when I arrived in London because I would need google maps to get to my new apartment. I politely asked one of the flight attendants if there was anywhere I could plug my phone in and he was very rude. I fly very frequently at least once a month and I will never fly with this Air Transat again.

### "experience was completely positive"
After reading negative reviews, we were dreading our first ever flights to and from Puerto Vallarta with Air Transat. We were very pleased to find out that our experience was completely positive. The check-in desk staff and flight attendants were helpful and cheerful, our seats were normal economy size and we had plenty of legroom. Movies were played on both flights. We were given complimentary drinks and the food for purchase was delicious. We had no delays or other problems and wouldn't hesitate to fly with Air Transat again.

### "We were disappointed"
Gatwick to Toronto. When we arrived at counter for checkin the behavior and attitude of staff was very bad. When we sat in the plane it was announced that there is no water in the washrooms and during the flight no tea or coffee will be provided. I am Muslim and were traveling with group of 4 no water in the washrooms means we can't use Washroom because we Muslim use water in the washrooms that is part of my faith. We were disappointed with both situations.

### "not very kid friendly"
Winnipeg to Cancun. I found this company to be very unorganized and not very kid friendly. I called before the flight to verify the number of bags we were allowed to bring free of charge. When we arrived to depart they tried charging me for 3 bags. Which I refused to pay for but they said I would have to pay on my flight home. They forgot to put priority tags on 1 of our bags and we had to wait about 15 minutes for it.. not fun with 3 tired kids. We had to ask them to put a movie on and it was NOT kid friendly. On our flight home they mixed up our seats from what we had selected and we were not able to sit with my parents. Making it difficult with 2 9 month olds and a 3 year old.. my parents even paid for Options Plus so they could select seats beside us. When I brought this up to the staff in Cancun they were very rude and offered no solution. I had to remind the staff once again to put our priority tags on our baggage on our return flight. The movie on the way back had a lot of violence and sexual content. Not good for my 3 year old to watch. Only thing going for Air Transat is the extra leg room.

### "very helpful and polite"
Not Verified |  I had great service. everyone was very helpful and polite. I had a severe anxiety attack and they were very helpful. they gave me a cold compress and relaxed me. I would certainly fly Air Transat again. thanks a lot to the staff of flight TS486.

### "sympathy and compassion they gave"
Not Verified |  I just got off the phone with Air Transat in Montreal and had to immediately write a review for the outstanding customer service I had been given. I had booked a flight for June from Calgary to London for my mom, however, due to circumstances, my mom was not able to go anymore. I had called Air Transat very unhappy and upset and asked if there was anyway I could get a refund for the flight as it was a lot of money for our sisters being students. I talked to the agent and asked if there was anyway I could get a refund or a little bit back. She was so patient and so so kind, she talked to the supervisor, and when she came back on the call and told me the good news, and that I was approved to get a refund on my ticket. I could not believe the sympathy and compassion they gave me and understood the situation I was in. Thank you so much.

### "Worst customer service"
Montreal to Toronto. Worst customer service. I had to go back to my destination sooner because of emergency. So I went to the airport 10 hours before my initial flight. Air Transat Staff asked me to call the customer service, they said they couldn’t help me. After 47 min waiting someone to answer my call, they casually asked me 350$ to modify a 75$ flight ticket. No decency.

### "No entertainment"
Gatwick to Toronto. Worst ever. No entertainment, no USB charger. For 10 hour flight, it is very hard to fly with kids. This was our first international flight which has nothing. Disappointed.

### "food from Toronto was terrible"
Porto to Toronto. An airline that simply does not care. First and last time using this airline. Flights were delayed without any update, vacation time is spent sitting at the airport. I realize they are inexpensive Airline, but there are lot of expenses besides airline tickets, like hotels, excursion. Inflight food from Toronto was terrible.

### "best flight of my life"
Gatwick to Toronto. This was the best flight of my life. The staff were phenomenal and the pilot kept the passenger informed about the delay (there was a two hour delay but the flight quality made up for it). The flight attendants were so kind and helpful. There was also complementary drinks and a meal and snacks. All of which were delicious. The staff also helped passengers move to seat where they might be more comfortable after departure. Because if this, I was able to spend the flight in an aisle seat where there wasn’t someone next to me, rather then in a middle seat squished between two strangers.

### "never fly Air Transat again"
This is the worst airline I have ever flown with. The trip from Vancouver to Toronto was abysmal. There was no complimentary food, not even a snack of any kind. No headphones either. Free juice was offered over 2 hours into the flight, one more pass for water over an hour after that. The seats were incredibly uncomfortable and there was almost no legroom. The flight home from Toronto to Vancouver was ten times worse. We were delayed over two hours at the terminal because it was "too cold". It was -15 degrees Celsius. This is the same temperature or warmer than it had been every day this week. Problem after problem made our delay longer and longer. From baggage handlers that felt it was too chilly to load our luggage for an hour, then everything kept freezing. The doors, landing gear, other panels. The hours ticked by. All they did was sort of apologise after every second or third incident. If they had any concern for their customers or invested money into standard de-icing spray, none of this would have happened. This is absolutely unacceptable. I will never fly Air Transat again.

### "impressed with this airline"
Toronto to Puerto Plata. I’m so impressed with this airline. We booked a vacation package and everything from boarding to flying to airport transfer to hotel choice was a five star experience. We experienced expected delays but even arrived within a half hour of expected landing times despite a horrific snow storm in Toronto. Every other airline cancelled or had six hour plus delays. Our flight attendant were very friendly, efficient and helpful both during departure and arrival flights from Canada. Also pleased with the leg room on the flight. Would definitely recommend air transat packages. Keep up the exceptional service!

### "I got back nothing"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Manchester. I added insurance when I booked my flight, a simple checked box. Of course they don’t tell you the amount you are insured for. No that it mattered as I got back nothing. The telephone number to make a claim which is on both Air Transat and Allianz websites are incorrect. I kept getting though to a ‘emergency international medical hotline’ After a few attempts over a number of days I finally had a representative transfer my call. Even the new number given to me from that call got though to the same number. Every question or email l sent they took the full allotted 3 weeks which is the maximum time allowed for them to respond. When I sent off my forms and receipts they said they hadn’t received. After 4 months of trying I just quit trying. I had also sent 3 or 4 emails directly to Air Transat and received not one single reply. The seats are cramped, the staff are ill mannered and poorly trained. I once had a seat next to a window in which the frame of the window protruded into my space so much that I was unable to sit back in my seat. My request for a change in seat got no response and I was told that if I called in to book they would of told me that. However l booked online. Thankfully after an hour a lady sitting close to me asked to swap. I would pay £200 extra per trip to not ever use this airline again.

### "wheels don't fit in the measurement"
Montreal to Toronto. Do not travel with them. Worst customer service. Will make some pay for baggage and others not. On our return flight was told I had to pay for my carry on. I said I didn't have to pay a few days ago when I flew in. she said because the wheels don't fit in the measurement I have to pay $35. She then said if I don't pay she will be at the gate and will make me pay there. We proceeded to pay. I was clearly upset. This woman then proceeded to talk about us to the other employees. We proceeded to the gate. When we got their she announced that if anyone would like to check in their bag even if its too big can do so free of charge. I approached her and said how is that right? Her response was things are different at the gate. It was a horrible and very upsetting experience.

### "my case was not there"
Montreal to Toronto. I was on my way to a to my niece’s wedding for the weekend with 1 suitcase. The individual checking in my suitcase, was rude and disrespectful when I had asked why I was being charged $35.00. I paid my 35$ and headed to security. Where she chased after me, forgetting to give me the tag for my suitcase. The flight went well, however when we arrived at the airport, we waited about 35-36 minutes for my suitcase to appear at baggage claim, and my case was not there. We spoke to an attendant, who had no idea where the bag was, and I was told my suitcase never made in on the plane! She then gave us a number to call the next day to track it down, and still nothing. The customer service line has been no help whatsoever. That’s if anyone even answers the phone. I’m currently heading back to Montreal now, exhausted, angry and confused as to how 1 suitcase can be lost in an hour long flight, and no one is able to help me or at the very least give me a $35 refund. This has been a horrible experience.

### "price for one bag is $35"
Montreal to Vancouver. So this was my very first time flying with Air Transat, I usually only fly with Air Canada or Westjet. I had one luggage to check in and I went to the airport baggage counter where the employee proceeds to tell me the price for one bag is $35. I had asked why it wasn't $25 like the other airlines and he told me that to get the cheaper price I had to prepay online. I specifically asked to clarify if that meant prepaying when checking in online. He told me yes. On my roundtrip flight back, I went online 24 hours beforehand to check-in and prepay my bag and found that THERE WAS NO OPTION TO EVEN ADD A BAG. I called up Air Transat and had to wait 5 HOURS before talking to anybody. They then told me I couldn't get a cheaper price if it was within 24 hours of my flight. This is absolutely ridiculous since all other airlines allow you to purchase your baggages online when you check-in and don't have price variations like Air Transat does. It was extremely inconvenient for me to have to go to the airport counter again in person to pay for my bag when I could have just breezed through the airport. I had called up customer service to see if they could help resolve my issue but they were unwilling to help in any way. It baffles me because the whole luggage process is actually really deceiving. They know that most people will only prepay bags when they check-in so they have this 24 hour rule and don't even have an option for selecting bags online to essentially force people to have to go to the airport counter and pay the overpriced bag amount. Overall, I had such a horrible  experience with Air Transat and would never fly with them again due to this inconvenience of their luggage process and their unsatisfying service.

### "wouldn't fly Air Transat again"
Toronto to Santa Clara. I paid $200 ($25/person/per flight) for my family of four so that we could sit together on our recent family vacation to Cuba (December 28, 2018-January 4, 2019). Why does a group have to pay for tickets and then pay additional to make sure they are not scattered around the plane? I still didn't get to sit with my family and am now fighting Air Transat to get my $200 back. My travel agent booked seats 8A/8B/8C and I was booked at seat 8H (across the aisle). When I check-in online before the flight I was assigned a seat further away so I manually chose 7A which was showing as available. When I got to the gate at the time of flight my seat had been changed to 10H. Wondered why I bothered to pay this surcharge and it bugged me the whole vacation. The attendant at the gate gave me the phone number for Customer Relations and told me to contact them when I returned home. There was nothing that she could do and it wasn't them (gate attendants) who assign the seats. What makes things even more frustrating is that when we got on the plane there were only two people sitting in 7A/7B/7C so there is absolutely no reason why I could not have sat there. Just asking to be refunded for the service that I paid for but was not provided. So frustrated that I am getting the run around instead of them just returning the money for a service that I didn't get. I have sent them the Boarding Passes for 7A and 10H as proof so should be a quick refund. Why doesn't Air Transat provide good customer service so that they would get good reviews instead of bad? Obviously they just don't care. I wouldn't fly with Air Transat again if I can help it and wouldn't recommend them to anyone.

### "such poor customer service"
Puerto Plata to Toronto. It's very difficult to express my disappoint with Air Transat. I attempted to contact the airline on the phone and waited nearly an hour and was told that I needed to be transfered to another dept. I waited another hour. When I spoke to a rep, I was then told that my inquiry for a veterans discount could only be done via an online form. I completed the form 3 times to be told that I did not meet the min timelines. I went ahead and paid for the Option Plus and when I boarded the aircraft I had to prove that I purchased it. They were unaware. To summarize, I have never experienced such poor customer service. I am currently on my second hour on hold while on vacation to confirm my seat.

### "never Air Transat again"
Not Verified | Montreal to Toronto. I’m on the plane right now, waiting for departure. It has been 2 hours past scheduled departure time. First, they claimed a couple of passengers missing, and then it was minor technical problems need to fix after the aircraft was about to take off. And now it’s the third time we came back to the gate to try to fix the technical issue that keeps reoccurring. WTF, is that supposed to be checked and done way before the boarding? Since when passengers onboard is required for their inspection job? We are still waiting, I really don’t know how much longer we will actually take off, never Air Transat again for sure!

### "service is just incomprehensible"
Vancouver to Puerto Vallarta. I was unable to take the trip last minute due to unforeseen circumstances, so my wife and I decided not to waste it and her and our 7 month old would go. We pre selected and paid for seats, checked in as though I was going and notified the lady at the check in that I would not be attending but paid for the extra seating regardless so they would have room and be comfortable. I received a call from my wife upset that the day at the gate was rude and ignorant and told her in no less words "tough luck" as she was assigning the seat to someone else that I paid for not once but twice with seat selection. I phone in to ensure this wouldn't be a problem on her return flight and was met with the same rudeness and hostility that she was clearly met with at the gate. It's our first trip with them and will be our last. The level of service is just incomprehensible.

### "I do not recommend"
Toronto to Edmonton. I arrived airport 1:15 minutes prior to departure time, no where to be found were Air Transat counter was, people in the airport were not able to help her. By the time she found the Air Transat counter, it was 50 minutes to departure normal, normally it's not a big issue with most airlines, but there was nobody at the counter. I tried calling Air Transat to find out what options are there, waited almost an hour to get through, when I finally got a hold of someone on Nov 26 11:10 PM, the agent was so rude, not friendly, told me I have to pay full price for next flight, which is fine, but she is just the wrong person in customer service. She said Air Transat recommends passenger arrive airport 3 hours prior to departure, but the itinerary says hour and half prior to departure time, who with the right mind would arrive 3 hours prior to departure on domestic flight. I do not recommend anyone flight with Air Transat, bad customer service, no counter service, no signs, and zero email communication.

### "crew rude and abrupt"
Athens to Montreal. Disappointed in the unfriendly demeanor of all but one of the airline attendants, the quality of the meals served, and the uncomfortable tight seating on this flight. Air Transat is a discount airline and everything is "extra" even the pillows and blankets for a 10-hour flight. The main meal was okay, but on both arrival and returns flights, the breakfast was a tasteless and unpleasant offering. On numerous occasions I noted cabin crew showed rude and abrupt behavior in response to passengers questions or requests; I have never seen such an unhappy bunch of people working in the service industry. I liked that this was a direct flight at a good price, but would probably pay more and go with a standard airline for a 10-hour flight in future. Movie and TV selection was pretty good.

### "very poor service"
We booked Option plus for our return flight, when we booked in at the airport there was no info on file that we had booked this, our pre booked seats in row 5 had been given to someone else and we were given seats in row 40. The staff contacted Montreal office who stated our agent in the UK had cancelled our seats, we had no agent as we booked our flights a year ago ourselves on the internet. We had had a problem going out from Manchester also with our Option plus segment there was no record of us booking this facility we had to prove to everyone we had paid for this service. My husband contacted Air Transat via e-mail when we got to our daughters in Toronto, the reply stated that he would be contacted in 28 days we are still waiting and that was July 28th, the same thing happened on return to the UK we are still waiting to hear from them, my husband has tried ringing them with no success. We are very unhappy with Air Transat, very poor service.

### "never again fly Air Transat"
Toronto to Rome. I weigh 130 lbs, and I felt crammed in my seat, they are so narrow, I didn’t even have room to put my Ipad between my hip and the seat, my arms were crossed against my chest almost the whole trip, my husband was even worse off than me as he weighs close to 200 lbs, we had absolutely no room to put our arms at our sides. Best leisure airline for 2018 - maybe for a one hour flight, but when you are taking a flight as long as 9.5 hrs to Italy, not the best plane. The food was horrendous, I couldn’t even take a second bite. My husband and I were lucky enough to buy seats in the emergency aisle, which cost a lot more money, but we at least had leg room. They ask that you remain seated with seatbelts fastened, sure easy enough for a short flight but not a long one, you need to get up so that you don’t lose circulation. I will never again fly with Air Transat, I will pay the extra money to go on another airline in order to be more comfortable and not feel like a sardine in a can. What a terrible experience.

### "Lead Agent aggressive and rude"
Not Verified | Vancouver to Rome via Montreal. My Air Transat Nightmare! Arrive airport 8:15 am for an 11:15am Air Transat departure to Montreal and then to Rome. Departed but returned as plane was mechanical. Landing gear stuck Agent told passengers to go eat for an hour but those boarding Rome cruise to wait as may fly us to Paris. Then we were expected to make our own way to Rome. Later told Montreal flight will wait to ensure we get to Rome in time for cruise departure. I discussed several times with the agent the idea of booking another flight with another airline as we had to be onboard the cruise in Rome by 5pm the following day, was guaranteed they would hold the flight in Montreal for the 18 passengers transferring to Rome 6 of which were to board the cruise. Departed at approx 1:15. Arrived Montreal 9:45; 5 minutes late. By the time we were off the plane and heading to the connecting flight we were 20 minutes late. Flight to Rome departed 25 minutes prior to us getting off plane. Told to wait for representative. A Lead Agent arrived. She was very aggressive and rude and explained that they can get us on the flight to Rome the next evening at 9:30pm. This was not going to help the 6 of us who had a ship departing the next afternoon in Rome. They refused to fly us to another city where we could board the cruise late or fly us home. This Lead Agent refused to provide her name or another contact of someone who could assist and make decisions as she clearly could not, simply told us to call the Call Centre who again would be unable to help and was closed. People were very upset and 2 elderly ladies were in tears. This woman was rude, aggressive and very unprofessional. As people were persistent she called in a gentleman to assist, we eventually realized he was not an Air Transat employee but was there to get us moving out of the airport. No one wanted to assist or try to problem solve this issue. Had travel agent on phone listening. The “Lead Agent with No Name” is yelling for me to hang up. Refused to speak with Travel Agent and yelled at other staff to “say nothing and don’t answer questions!” Told Air Transat is only responsible to get us to Rome and would fly us out the next day. However all documentation sent regarding the flight was entitled Air Transat - Greek Cruise? Clearly there is a partnership in this booking and they should have taken some responsibility. Given a $400 travel voucher for our troubles, then given a document in French and asked to sign upon receipt of the voucher. The “Lead Agent with No Name” had been told by all that no one spoke French. Luckily my limited understanding of the language allowed me to understand that this was a waiver stating we would not pursue any other action following receipt of this voucher. I recommended to all not to sign and tossed my voucher in the trash. Given a hamburger voucher and sent to ant infested hotel. Yes, the hotel had no working phone, coffee maker but did have ants crawling up the walls and on the floor. This arrival to this hotel was followed being taken and dropped of in a parking lot of the wrong hotel. By now it was 2am and we were all exhausted and in shock at the appalling treatment. The following day we returned to the airport at noon as directed the previous evening. I anticipated they may have a flight available allowing us to catch up with the cruise. Nope, they wanted us out of the hotel as did not want to pay for a late check out. No employees were available.

### "unacceptable customer service"
In July 2018 I flew from Gatwick to Vancouver  with my bike. Upon arrival, my bike wasn't there. After completing all paperwork required, I was told I'd receive a phone call that day with an update. I never received a phone call and spent my next 5 days contacting Air Transat only to be told to call a different number or email a different email and no-one seemed to be able to give me an update on my bike. After 3.5 days, someone finally responded saying they found my bike. As I was leaving 2 days later and my bike was apparently still in London, I requested to leave it in London as I'd have to pay the additional fee to take it back with me without being able to use it. As you guessed it, no response. I spent a lot of time trying to get updates after that, only to be told it's now on a flight to Vancouver (facepalm). I continued to request updates knowing that I was flying back the next day, but no response at all. I repeat, nothing. The morning I checked out my hotel notified me that my bike was delivered to my hotel a couple of hours earlier, no communication from Air Transat at all. When checking in for my flight they still made me pay the additional luggage fee, even after explaining everything that happened. They gave me a business card and told me to email them and said I'd be able to claim the money back. It's now 2 months later and I still haven't received anything, I'm still chasing them for my refund. Absolutely unacceptable customer service. It was an extremely stressful week for me and I lost a whole week of training, which is really frustrating in the middle of my race season. I just don't understand why these people work for the same company but don't communicate with each other. Instead, they make their customer work extremely hard to get any information and sometimes don't even tell you that you supposedly contacted the wrong department. They'll tell you when you've waited forever and reach out again as you still haven't had an update.

### "No Air Transat again"
Lack of efficiency and helpfulness of Air Transat staff - Vancouver to Venice transit at Toronto. I was watching the downloaded movies on my iPhone 8+ (recommended by Transat's office in Vancouver as the screen on the aircraft was too small) on flight TS168 from Toronto to Venice on Sep 7, 2018. I put back my iPhone in the seat pocket (I think most people usually do) after watching the movie and dozed off. I was so tired when the plane touched down Venice Marco Polo Airport. I scrambled to keep all my stuff in my backpack. When we were at the arrival area searching for our local tour guide, I realized my iPhone was missing. Immediately, we approached our tour guide for assistance. The tour guide directed us to the Lost & Found and Flight Information counters. Both counters could not help us as iPhone was classified as a valuable item. We were given a slip of paper with a Lost Property email. We hastened to our tour guide again for help. Our tour guide approached one of the Transat's ground crew staff. She offered to assist. She started to call someone in Italian which both of us could not understand. She told us to wait at the Flight Information area while she rushed to the aircraft to check. Apparently, the same aircraft was flying back to Toronto in 2 hours. We told our tour guide to proceed with the rest of the people in the group to the hotel. We would manage ourselves by taking a cab. We felt so bad delaying the rest of the tour group. We waited frantically without any update from the Transat staff. who helped us. We checked with the Flight Information and being told that woman was not their staff and no item returned. We were tired and flabbergasted being pushed around and no avenue to get help. We waited for three hours standing at the counter and afraid to move away. We were like being punished. The staff who offered her help did not contact the Flight Information counter or at least turn up to update us the status. She just disappeared! We were totally disappointed with the service. I lost all my contacts, my valuable photos and many notes in my iPhone 8+. The worst is Transat is not making any efforts to assist me! My wife wrote to the Lost Property. She received a reply the next day stating that no item of what we reported was returned. When we were back to Vancouver, the call to Air Transat customer office was a nightmare. The call was placed on hold for at least half an hour. When a staff eventually picked up the call could not answer me and connect me to another department. There again, you were put on hold. No Air Transat again. Never!

### "cannot be remotely helpful"
Flew Air Transat from Athens to Montreal. Really terrible customer service. I have never encountered someone so rude as their customer service supervisor who actually hung up on me when he wasn’t able to answer my question. Would not give them your money when they cannot be remotely helpful if issues are encountered.

### "This was the worst flight"
Montréal to Barcelona. This flight was the worst flight that I ever have been on. I was sitting near the window, and I could not sit straight, I did not fit in the seat, can you imagine. I am a man of 5.10, 172 pound and my shoulder did not fit in the seat. They finally saw that one seat was available in the back so they transferred me. I was hit by every one that went to the bathroom. I have to return this Sunday, and I am apprehending the return like you can not imagine. I arrived in Barcelona very tired, and I can not imagine my return to work.

### "crew were polite and attentive"
We flew club class from Toronto to Montreal and were supposed to catch an 11:15 connecting flight (also Air Transat) to Porto, Portugal. Upon arrival at Trudeau we were informed the flight was cancelled and were immediately taken to see a representative. We were put up at the Marriott at Trudeau for the night, given a $200 travel voucher each and a card to claim any expenses from our stay at Trudeau. We were also given food vouchers. All of this without needing to ask. They simply offered it. We were also re-booked for the next day at 16:00. So the next day came and we left the hotel at noon. We went to check in and found out the flight was delayed until 19:50 and that it would be an A340-300. The clerk at the counter wouldn't come out and say it when I inquired which was a little bit of a sore spot for me but we later found out it was Hi-Fly thanks to some sleuthing on Flight Radar 24. For the record, Hi-Fly did an amazing job as a sub for our later flight. As for the flight itself from Toronto to Montreal, it was excellent. I'm a very nervous flyer and even I was impressed. Pilot was excellent and the crew were polite and attentive. Obviously being a short flight we didn't get a ton of things as our amenities kit would be handed out on our later trans-Atlantic flight. We were however given our ear buds (pretty good sound quality too) and a bottle of water. About 20 minutes after takeoff we were served our cheese plate which was actually quite good. It also came with crackers which themselves were good. Airline food is tough to pull off to begin with but I really feel like Transat did a great job. Flying club class was a treat as being a bigger guy (6'2 280 lbs.) with broad shoulders, I was pleasantly surprised at the fact I could sit with my arms at my sides and not touch my fiancee. Given it also cost less than a flex economy fair on Air Canada for two people it was more than worth it. I'm still giving them a 10/10 because while the delays were irksome and technically maintenance related, I like the fact that they played it safe and cancelled the flight and I also give them full credit for handling it so professionally and making it a much easier experience. I know too many people who've had to fight airlines for things they screwed up. Transat owned the issue and did all they could to correct it. I'd fly them again in a heartbeat.

### "Very disappointing"
On our recent flight from Toronto to Zagreb, I was reviewing the digital duty free descriptions while on the flight and noted that a gift would be provided if a combined total of $99 was spent. We went ahead and made our purchase which was over the $99 and were then told no gift as this was an old promotion, yet the in-flight online entertainment on our TV screens was showing that indeed we were owed a gift. The one stewardess was very polite and provide me with an envelope with the customer service contact. Upon contacting the appropriate department, we were told "Sorry for the inconvenience" we cannot do anything to help you. Very disappointing. False advertising is what that is. I can understand if this was on a printed copy of the duty free magazine, but on the digital one? I even took pictures, which I supplied to customer service, who again said, we cannot help you. Oh well. The joys of flying with a low budget carrier. Next time, I guess we ask for our free gift first and then pay for our purchases.

### "have been very unhelpful"
Not Verified |  My brother, my husband and I flew Air Transat Dublin to Toronto direct non-stop on Sat. 08 September 2018. We, all three checked in at the Air Transat desk in Dublin airport at the same time as a group of three. Each of us checked in one piece of labeled luggage for putting in the hold. To our knowledge there was only one Air Transat flight from Dublin on that day. My husband and my luggage arrived in Toronto Pearson International airport but my brother’s did not and still has not arrived. Air Transat staff at Toronto and Customer Service have been very unhelpful. An employee at the Air Transat baggage reclaim desk unbelievably transcribed incorrectly the baggage tag no. presumably making it impossible for him or anyone else to track the mislaid piece of luggage. He then assured us that there was another Air Transat flight next day, Sunday 09 September and that he was sure it would arrive then. I, who had made the Air Transat booking was pretty sure there was no flight next day but he confirmed there was and not to worry. There was no flight from Dublin next day as my brother found out when, having heard nothing, he went back out to Pearson International and was told next flight was Monday 10 not Sun 09. Since then nothing from Air Transat at Pearson international. An attempt to reach Air Transat customer service this am after 9 am, meant a long period on hold listening to music followed by a request to leave a message on voicemail with the assurance it would be answered asap. No answer as yet (16.50). This was intended to be the trip of a life-time. Thanks to Air Transat’s appalling incompetence and indifference it is turning into a nightmare, the worst part of the experience has been the absolute refusal of Air Transat to make any efforts to contact Dublin Airport or communicate with us that they had made any effort to contact Dublin airport or make any effort to locate the mislaid piece which contains irreplaceable items. Since that initial meeting where incorrect information was recorded by the Air Transat employee and incorrect info.given to us by the Air Transat employee there has been no communication from Air Transat. Air Transat has been my favorite airline for travel to Canada but if this matter is not resolved promptly and satisfactorily by Air Transat I will never use or recommend them again.

### "would not recommend Air Transat"
Tel Aviv to Toronto via Montreal. I would not recommend Air Transat. I paid 180 dollars in advance for booking a seat on the flight Tel Aviv-Montreal on August 6, 2018 9A and 9C. These places were very comfortable for me and my child as they are from the first part of the aircraft. When I made check-in for the flight at Tel Aviv, I was given absolutely different seats (44A and 44C) which are located in the tail section of the aircraft. For all my requests to provide me my pre-paid seats Air Transat representative in very rude manner told me to shut up and choose 2 options: either sit where he tells me, or stay in Tel Aviv. Flight Tel Aviv - Montreal was delayed more than 1 hour and we were late for our next flight Montreal - Toronto. We contacted Air Transat to reimburse us above costs which we paid for seats and second flight. Sent an email to their customer relations on 8/08/2018, reminded again to give us a reply on 8/22/2018 and 8/29/2018, but no response still till today (9/10/2018). And what even worse is their service/customer relations department ignored to response our email for reimbursement. This was our first time to take Air Transat, and it would also be the last I believe.

### "I would not recommend"
Vancouver to Toronto. My family, total 10 persons, took Air Transat TS980 flight from Vancouver to Toronto on Jun 29th, 2018, which was scheduled to departure at 22:55 that night. However, because of mechanical issue, the flight was delayed to 22:50 Jun 30th, 2018, almost 24 hours delay. We booked hotel in Niagara Falls and also the car rental on 6/29 and those were not be able to cancelled because the last minute flight delay. We contacted Air Transat to reimburse us above costs which we actually paid but were not be able to use because of their flight delay. Sent an email to their customer relations on 7/16/2018, reminded again to give us a reply on 8/18/2018 and 8/30/2018, but no response still till today (9/6/2018). Our vacation was ruined because their slow response to take actions while they found the mechanical issue and only could arrange another flight by around 24 hours later. And what even worse is their service/customer relations department ignored to response our email for reimbursement. This was our first time to take Air Transat, and it would also be the last I believe. I would not recommend Air Transat to any of my friends.

### "worst travel experience"
My wife and I travelled return Vancouver to Toronto on what we thought was Air Transat Club Class. It was the worst travel experience in a very long. We are getting on in years and are willing to pay the extra money to travel premium economy whenever we can, which meant Club Class on Air Transat for several years. This last time did not resemble Club Class in any way and certainly did not resemble the comfort and amenities that are illustrated on their web site, and not what we paid what turned out to be an exorbitant amount for. Separate cabin? NO. Economy cramped space all around. Wide spacious leather seats? NO. The seats were just the regular cramped economy seats with the middle seat vacant. Individual entertainment centre? NO. Just a shared screen that popped out of the ceiling. 4. Choice of entertainment? NO. One movie and something else played, the same on both parts of the journey. Didn't even bother using our headphones that we had brought with us. So what we planned as a pleasurable start and end of our trip turned into an uncomfortable misrepresented ripoff.

### "they deleted my comments"
They don't send you a boarding pass electronically and will not print your boarding pass if you arrive to their counter checked in when there is one hour left for departure. What's the point of checking in if you have to go to the counter to get your boarding pass? Seats are tiny, and customer service is rude and unhelpful to say the least. They told me that they spoke with the Air Transat staff at the airport and confirmed that no one had come to the counter, therefore I must've gone to the wrong counter! Air Transat left a stain on our vacation. I reached out to them over social media and was asked to send an email. Not only did they not return my email, but they also deleted my comments.

### "wonderful flight attendants"
I am writing to heap praise on the wonderful flight attendants who took such wonderful care of us on a recent flight to Tel Aviv from Montreal on Air Transat! It was an incredibly smooth flight on a beautiful new plane! The flight attendants went above & beyond to make us feel comfortable, happy and appreciated, and really knew how to take care of passengers in the right way, as they were smiling from the minute we got on the plane, to the minute we got off. All this to say, it was a great way to start our fantastic trip to Israel, and it helped make it a very memorable vacation. You can be sure we will be flying with Air Transat in the future. The price was also affordable, and the in-flight entertainment up to par. An overall great experience and they deserve high marks!

### "seems to be a trend of lateness here"
So I just did a flight to Toronto from Marsaille via Montreal. The flight to Montreal was a full 2h 30min late in departure and the airline did accommodate for this by arranging connecting flights. However, even the accommodating flight was late to board by 45 min so there seems to be a trend of lateness here. Anyway, it took about an hour or maybe more for the luggage to finally come to the carousel. This was after multiple starts and stops of the carousel which was very demoralizing. Overall, good customer service, but nothing is on time!

### "delayed our flight 3 times"
Flew Toronto to Varadero, Cuba. A mechanical problem on the plane at 5 am delayed our flight 3 times by a total of 12 hours. We were supposed to leave at 7.05 am, then 11.10 am, and now 7.15 pm, fingers crossed. They are now bringing in a plane from Montreal. The issues were known at sunrise and this is the best that Air Transat can do? We missed 1 day of our vacation and they don't care.

### "found the seats comfortable"
Porto to Montreal. I was diagnosed with shingles while on holiday in Portugal. It was a nasty case with a lot of pain. Our insurance company recommended a quick return to Canada. We had to cancel our flights out of Lisbon and find a way home from Porto. Due to the nature of the disease I only had about an 8 hour window when I was relatively pain free. The pain medications I had would only last an hour or two. I wasn't keen being trapped on a trans-Atlantic flight for 6 or 7 hours. We found one flight out of Porto to Montreal that left Porto at noon which was optimal. It was on an Air Transat A330. I couldn't afford any delays. Check in was quick and easy, the flight was right on time. The aircraft loaded quickly and fortunately for me it was not overly crowded and there was room to stretch out. We found the seats comfortable and food and beverage service was great. After 2 movies I felt confident I was going to make it without a pain attack. We landed in Montreal on time and after a long walk we ended up at the customs area with 500 other passengers. My pain free window was closing quickly. Our nexus cards worked like a charm and we were through to the baggage area in 5 minutes. Priority baggage stickers also worked and our luggage was out first. Hopped on a shuttle to an airport hotel. Rested for a day before we caught another flight to Edmonton. Ended up in the hospital when we got home. Now on the right meds and pain free. Please get the new shingles vaccine before you head overseas.

### "poor communication and customer service"
Vancouver to Rome via Toronto. We flew with Air Transat from Vancouver to Rome return at the end of May. We had so many problems on these flights and I will never book with them again. The flight was delayed by 6 hours on our flight to Rome. I missed an important meeting that I had in Italy because of this. I understand that they need to have a safe plane. However, there is an obligation that they maintain their planes so that they do not have issues. There was almost no communication with us to let us know what was going on for the 6 hours. The offered a food voucher after 3 hours and we had to line-up for an hour while they hand wrote them for each passenger. By the time that we got it there was only one food place open and we had to line-up for an hour! Really poor communication and customer service. They lost our luggage on the return flight from Rome and again there was no communication when the 32 people that lost their luggage and were worried about missing their connecting flight. We asked them on the flight to let the desk in Vancouver know so that they could be prepared for 32 people to arrive late at night from Rome and have the paperwork done. They did not do this and we had to wait for a long time to fill out paperwork. The seats, comfort and entertainment on the plane coming from Rome to Toronto was fine. The seats and comfort in the domestic flights was not good at all. The worst part is that when I called to talk to them about my poor experience - they really did not care. Do not fly with Transat. I would not recommend it.

### "experience was not comfortable"
❌ Not Verified |  Manchester to Toronto. Have flown with this company several times since 2012 and been quite satisfied for the price we paid. Always paid extra for Option plus as the quick check in and boarding / security outbound was worth the cost. Cabin crew have always been polite & helpful. However our latest experience was not comfortable. The outward journey was the worst, in an older plane which clearly needed upgrading. One of the seats in front of us was faulty and fell backwards to a bad angle each time the passenger leaned back on it, making it unpleasant to have right in front of our faces. The individual screens were not in complete working order and the outer arm rests did not move to enable easy exit from the seats. Food was edible but not great. Not a good journey, return was slightly better but not great. Will probably look elsewhere for any future journeys sadly.

### "good value for our money"
I have nothing but good things to say about both flights we took with Air Transat in May 2018 flying from Vancouver to London Gatwick. Flight personnel were very helpful and pleasant with all passenger interactions (that I witnessed), leg room was good, in-flight entertainment was great and meals, well, meals were airplane food, but at least there were meals! Also felt we got good value for our money.

### "at least onboard service was good"
Toronto to Lisbon return. Flying out from Toronto is always a pleasure. Quick check-in, efficient staff, no hassles, it never takes 10 minutes to drop my bags, get the boarding pass and reach security. Organized boarding, excellent service. I purchased Option Plus for the extra bag and priority boarding, and it really helped me get settled in quicker and get my bags faster upon arrival. Very different story out of Lisbon on the return flight. There was a huge line in a maze for the 3 or 4 regular check-ins, and a single file with about 8 people in the Option Plus. I was the 9th in that line. It took at least 40 minutes to process the ones in front of me. We slowly watched as everyone else was processed before, and after the line was almost cleared, one of the counters closed, and two others were still there but chatting to each other, when they could have helped with the Option Plus standstill. This was an absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable situation for having paid for priority check-in and boarding, and seeing staff idling about. When I finally got done dropping my bags, passed security, an additional passport check, and had to walk 20 minutes to what was probably the furthest terminal at the airport, everyone else was piled up in an unorganized manner for boarding and I asked at the counter where the line for Option Plus boarding was. There wasn't one. There were two attendants at the counter talking to each other, and one female attendant sitting behind the counter pointed and told me to talk to the person checking boarding passes for everyone else and have him let me through. She could have very well checked my boarding pass and passport and let me through, but no, redirected me to the huge line. This man completely ignored me as I asked 3 times "excuse me, sir" gradually raising my voice each time. Eventually he noticed me and let me through by undoing the "rope", while I got nasty looks from other passengers who insisted on pushing me out of the way and not letting me through either. I actually got fed up and raised my voice with "Sorry, Option Plus, excuse me" and stepped in. This could have been avoided with a proper Option Plus separate line, or with proper attention from the staff, but most importantly, with actually processing Option Plus passengers BEFORE regular fare. I feel like I didn't receive the value for what I paid for the return trip. Toronto to Lisbon experience is a 10/10. Lisbon to Toronto would get a zero if I could, but at least onboard service was good. My rating is based on the return flight.

### "cheap and stingy and poor"
❌ Not Verified |  Manchester to Toronto. I am a 24 year old single mum of my first baby and this was my first time flying with my baby. The flight was of a very good price at £350, fights are direct and leave and return at great times.They offer lovely food and drink. They fly from Manchester and London which are great points. On my flight to Toronto I had to book my seat with my baby bassinet in advance. I could not book it online, it was an incredibly fussy and tedious process of waiting a long time on the phone only to have to fork out £50 per way and request usage of the bassinet - the only one on the flight. Heaven knows what they do if more than one small baby boards the flight. The seat itself was not even right beside the bassinet, it was not particularly comfortable and the bassinet was way high above reach. The flight attendants were all too happy to pay attention to the elder folk around me but took no time to pay attention to me and my baby and ask if we were okay. You have to pay for a “comfort set” - pay for your ear phones and blanket on a long distance flight. This says to me cheap and stingy and poor. I bought a gourmet meal; I got my food and drink - very nice in fact, until they came around with standard meals and drinks and offered me a drink. They said because I had had wine with my gourmet meal I “wasn’t allowed” it unless I paid. Technical errors trying to check in online. My flight home the airline staff forgot to give me a bag for my pram at check in to cover it, when I arrived to board they had no spares and made no rush to check for me. At boarding me and my then 3 month old baby were told to stand back and let the elderly and wheelchairs board, then we were told that the “Plus” option passengers had priority before us to board so we must wait for them to board. On the flight, my baby was sick and tired and I had to bounce him on my lap or he would have screamed. An air hostess came to me and said, “The lady in the plus section in front of you has complained that you are making her seat vibrate because you’re bouncing your baby.” To which I responded, “What would you like me to do?” And she just laughed falsely and walked away.

### "no date when bag will arrive"
Manchester to Vancouver. Lost bags of me and 15 others (!) Keep getting told they will arrive, then they won't, then they will. Have no clothes 3 days later and no date when bag will arrive. Customer service are no help. Avoid!

### "airline lost my luggage"
Toronto to Paris. This is a very irresponsible company with bad customer service. After a long wait of delayed flight (5 hours delay) I arrived to Paris on May 5th, 2018. After a long flight I went to pick up my luggage and it was a nightmare when I realized the airline lost my luggage. I filed a complaint and I was told that I was going to get my luggage delivered next day. It is May 9th, they have not bother to call me to provide me an status of when they are planning to deliver my luggage.

### "customer service completely brutal"
Lisbon to Toronto. The flight and the crew were awesome, but the customer service after arrival has been completely brutal. I’ve been waiting to have my luggage shipped from Toronto to Regina for eight days now. We landed during the Pearson Airport storm, so a few days delay for baggage was acceptable, but after eight days I still have not recovered my suitcase. Long hours of being on hold on the phone and no compensation or apology or anything. Story keeps changing. I would never ever fly with this airline again until they get their act together.

### "no organization at all"
Flew Air Transat from Punta Cana to Toronto. We were bused to Punta Cana airport on March 25 from our hotel 3 hours before departure. When we arrived there were over 1000 people standing in a line for 4 different flights out. Apparently the computer system was down for Air Transat and to what we heard it was the same the day before our departure. We stood in the line for 5 hours in the heat to check in, no organization at all, once in a while you heard them asking for passengers to Montreal only to process first and when they finished that crowd the next city was called we were the last ones. By the way all boarding passes and luggage tags were hand written. If they knew they had this major problem why did they transport us all at the same time to the airport, they knew that the flights were all going to be delayed by hours. We finally got on the plane 7 hours later.

### "always seem ready for a dispute"
The plane seems clean and new. The flight crew are moderately friendly but always seem ready for a dispute. The main issue is that Air Transat staff in the Dominican Republic are ill-equipped to handle a problem. On the weekend of March 24-25, the airport experienced a computer outage. Yet, instead of informing travellers, Air Transat staff transported us to the airport as if nothing was happening. We stood in line for over three hours just to check in, with virtually no communication - it was as if their agents were "hiding". Some other AT staff were taking pictures of the sea of people from atop a staircase. Glad we could provide their social media entertainment. The mark of a solid airline is how they react when stuff goes wrong - and it always does - Air Transat failed miserably buy putting their head in the sand, adopting the ostrich pose and hoping that we would all just go away. Disgusting. You will see a pic of one of their staff giving me the peace sign after we had been standing for five hours.

### "Very unhappy with this situation"
Vancouver to Toronto. I booked my trip to Toronto and thankfully I double checked my banking account and noticed that I was charged three times for my one flight. I called the customer service line and told them that I only received one confirmation email but I was charged three times for my flight they said it would take 5 to 7 business days to refund my money. I called today on the seventh business day and was informed that they never actually process my claim and now I have to wait another 5 to 7 business days to receive my money. I talk to somebody in customer relations and she said it wasn't their fault it was mine because I booked three flights which did not happen I only received one confirmation it was a glitch in their system and now I have to wait for a significant amount of time to receive my money! If I hadn't called today to see where my refund was it would still not be processed! Very unhappy with how this situation has been handled thus far.

### "The food was simply terrible"
When we flew out to Malaga from MTL, approx. 6hr flight, the aircraft was new with personal entertainment screens, but the seats were very tight and quite uncomfortable. My BF, 6ft2" had an aisle seat and regardless, his legs could not fit anywhere, kept getting hit by the food cart and the food tray couldn’t unfold properly as it was resting at an angle on his thighs. The food was simply terrible. They served sandwiches that were just horrible. No one around us were eating their food and were all staring at one another in terror. I had requested a Gluten Free meal when booking and I would have preferred the horrible mushy sandwich to eat some of the condiments inside than the GF, "I don't know what it was and can't call it a sandwich either with ingredients that are not only GF but also alien". When I asked the Flight Attendant to get a "regular" sandwich she said, "you selected GF and I'm not sure I have other sandwiches left". She miraculously found a spare mushy meal. All this to say we starved. On the way back from Malaga to MTL, I tried upgrading to Club only to find out the extra charge was approx. $900 per person due to the fare price and upgrade costs etc. (fare difference 600 + 300 for upgrade or something of that sort). We checked-in online 12hrs prior to selecting our seats and 4hrs prior to take off, we received a message informing us the flight was delayed about 1hr, therefore we waited and headed to the airport as per schedule taking in consideration the delay, only to be the last ones at the counter where the crew made a comment that they were about to close check in even though we still arrived a little over 2hrs before take off. Basically they were operating as if there were no delays! We made it through and decided to buy our food before boarding, due to the last event on the way in. The plane was late for unknown reasons and was old. I remember taking this aircraft in 1998, one of my first trips to Mexico (3.5hr or so, short flight though). Now on the way back our flight was over 8hrs and the old plane, although the seats were more spacious and slightly comfier than the "new" version, had no personal entertainment system. We had to watch the movie playing on the overhead TV. Remember those? I thought they were extinct! They served a better meal and the staff were nicer and more enjoyable to the passengers, thanks to the head manager who I assume spreads good energy and is compassionate. I travel a lot for work and leisure, taking over 30 flights, if not more a year and I have never seen this. We pay good money to travel and I can't understand how airlines keep depreciated in value and service. Truly a shame when traveling should be respected and valued.

### "will avoid Air Transat whenever possible"
On March 10, 2018 when we were flying from Toronto Pearson to Cancun (departure time 06:15), we were called to the counter at the gate to (verify Travel documents I guess), along with a dozen or more other passengers. When we came to the counter, the woman behind the counter immediately asked me if I would like to check my carry-on luggage. I said I’d rather not. She said that my carry-on might be too big for the plane and might not fit into the overhead cabinet. When I walked to the carry-on luggage sizing thing beside the counter, she said that one wasn’t for Air Transat; and the flight was full and she was asking passengers to voluntarily check their carry-ons. I hesitated for a moment. Before I could say anything, she said that we would need to check all our carry-ons (our family of four each had a carry-on). My son and daughter’s carry-on were quite small, smaller than the usual carry-on size. Then another Air Transat woman started putting check-in sticker on all our luggage, while I firmly said No and I would not want to check all our carry-ons. It was voluntary and our luggage was not oversized, and I refused to check them in. The younger women continued putting check-in stickers on our luggage, looked at me through the side of her eye and said “you will board the plane if you don’t check your luggage!”. I was very upset. I demanded to see her Air Transat badge but she refused to show it to me and tucked it under her uniform. In the end, a man in Air Transat uniform came out. He removed other sticker except one on our largest luggage. The funny thing was that, once we got on the plane, we noticed 1/3 of the overhead bins were empty! The bins on the A330 were very large and the largest carry-on would fit without any problem! I travel quite a bit, for work and for vacation. This has to be the worst experience with any airline I have had so far. I will avoid Air Transat whenever possible.

### "never had problems with them"
Amsterdam to Vancouver. I’ve been on vacation with Air Transat 2 times already and this June we'll go on our third trip with them. It’s so much cheaper than other airlines from my area. So far I never had problems with them. Flights were on time with no delays, cabin staff was friendly. Ground staff was friendly too except for that one woman who didn’t even knew I was allowed 2 suitcases so she needed to ask her colleague about that. Food was edible (still airplane food but okay). The first time I flew air Transat they we’re providing hot meals, I got the vegetarian Asia rice. It was actually good. When we flew with them last year, we got sandwiches which weren’t bad either. When you book Option plus you get additional snacks and drinks for free, and also you can bring two pieces of luggage (a big plus for me!) and choose your seats in advance. If you didn’t book this Option you have to pay for blankets and pillows if you want any or didn’t bring your own. Of course there are other airlines providing blankets and pillows but I think it’s disgusting regarding that those are most likely to never be washed after they were used on a previous flight. Of course seating is cramped, what do you expect for the price? I am short, so no problem for me if the legroom is limited. If you’re tall you shouldn’t book transatlantic flights with them. Overall the seats are comfortable with an adjustable headrest. The IFE (personal screens) is really good, you can check what movies are on your flight online or through their app. The only complaint I have is that those tv shows on the IFE are rust random episodes from random seasons,  so if you’re new to a show you can’t really watch it. You can use your own headphones for the IFE and it also has a USB port for you to charge your phone. On a flight back to AMS my screen froze after watching a movie. I asked a flight attendant if she could help and she immediately did! (If this happens to you just press the "i" Button until your screen restarts) In conclusion I’d fly with them again, and I will. You don’t get all the perks with Air Transat if you compare it to other (much more expensive) airlines. Pack your own food if you’re a picky eater and fill up your waterbottle after security and you should be good.

### "policy needs to be reviewed"
Paris to Vancouver. In September of this past year I booked a flight home from Paris to Vancouver with my four children to see my mother/their grandmother who was in hospital battling the final stages of cancer. I planned our trip for a three week timeframe knowing very well I may have to extend our flight depending on when my mother would pass. Already an absolutely horrible thing to have to deal with, my experience with Air Transat didn't make it any easier. As our return date approached, I called the airlines to extend our trip so that we could stay with my mother until the end. The policy when it comes to changing flights is absurd! I called in advance respecting the timelines, that was not a problem, I knew there was a fee, I excepted that, what made this process next to impossible is that one has to choose the specific date of return, how am I to know in this case!? Not only that but not only to you pay a fee to change the flights, you also pay the difference in price. What should be a simple change ended up being incredibly complicated. My mother ended up passing away one week later than our return flight home. It was more expensive to change my flight with Air Transat for the 5 of us again, that to fly home to France and book a whole new flight with another airline. My children ended up not being there when their grandma passed. I had to fly them all home, and then turn around and get on another flight back to Vancouver. You would think that in the case of family emergencies companies would be a little more compassionate to grieving families. Your policy needs to be reviewed. Super not impressed.

### "airline is not reliable"
When I booked the round trip flight from Vancouver to Varadero, I also selected the seats with the payment of $100. However, when we checked both in YVR and Varadero airports, we were given different seats. We were very disappointed with the service. On January 30th 2018, I sent an email to ask for a refund, the answer was they will send a feedback within 10 days. Up to today, February 14, 2018, no reply has been sent from Air Transat. So far, I have sent 3 emails to ask the same question, but nothing has change. This airline is not reliable and not worth to buy any service provided. I don’t think I will not take this airline for my vacation.

### "plane was making a stop-over"
Vancouver to Punta Cana. Air Transat's prices are lower than other airlines', but not so much lower as to warrant choosing them. They need to understand that money is not everything. Stress and broken trust are just as important in the long run, and will cost them many customers. We chose this airline for our holiday trip for the sole reason that it was advertised, and confirmed upon booking, as a non-stop flight to that particular destination. Not "direct" but specifically "non-stop. West Jet offered a very similar price for a comparable duration of flight, but was upfront about a stopover. When it came time to check in, we found that the departure time had been advanced by 2.5 hours because now the plane was making a stop-over. If you've worked a long shift the previous day and cannot sleep on planes, getting up at 3 am compared to 5:30 is not a pleasant start to a holiday. The same added stop-over for the return trip, only this time the plane was scheduled to arrive late rather than leave early. We arrived home in the early hours of the morning. Say what you want about the fine print and their right to add a stop, but false advertising is still false advertising when you speak plain English. The booking number they give you on confirmation is useless when you try to access My Booking: the system keeps telling you that the number cannot be found. It was impossible to log and select seats even with the option to pay for them, and by the time we checked in for the flight, all the window seats with an adjacent middle seat were taken. They can't seem to get organized even when the customer is willing to pay for seat selection. I have nothing negative to say about the flights themselves and the onboard service; the personnel are friendly and helpful.

### "no food for everyone even kids"
Cancun to Toronto. Our flight had 3 hours delay which was not a big deal, but worse part was having no food for everyone even kids. They were explaining that it's finished and who were sitting on the first rows bought all of foods! I registered my kid for Kids Club but there isn't any advantage - no special things nothing. When they don't have enough food and the flight has delay, it suppose to serve kids first then everybody.

### "cramped and uncomfortable"
My husband and I travel at least once a year by plane, but we will never travel again with Air Transat. We arrived at Toronto Airport January 24 at 5:30pm from Montego Bay. The seating is terribly cramped and uncomfortable. A small drink of water, soda or juice is offered during a 4 plus hour trip: however, you can order a small amount of food (piece of pizza and drink). A can of beer or mixed drink is an outrageous price. There is no way of resting on this airline as the entire time passengers are bothered relentlessly by airline staff encouraging them to spend, spend, spend on overpriced junk. Earbuds (to watch a movie) are a price of $9.00 per passenger. If you're the unlucky ones (as we were) seated in front of the emergency exits, your seat at the same cost as all other seats, does not recline: however, you may be offered free earbuds that do not work at those seats, and if you ask for assistance in getting the earbuds to work and the flight staff simply ask others around you if their earbuds work then proceeded to do nothing any further, much less, they don't have the decency to come back to you with an answer or assistance - they simply move on as though you didn't ask them for help at all. Disgusting! When we left Jamaica we had our bag with two bottles of boxed rum and a couple of breakable items labeled with white tape marked in large bold red letters reading fragile, and we paid $35.00 American dollars to put that bag through. Upon arrival at Pearson Airport in Toronto Canada, we found the bottles of rum and breakables broken - the luggage ruined. We then went to the Air Transat rep and received a pile of attitude from staff refused to address our complaint.Another Air Transat rep stepped up and told us there was nothing he could do or would do about the broken goods or soiled luggage but gave us the brush by handing us a Air Transat card to call the office.

### "the legroom was fine"
Nice to Montreal. I booked a ticket from Air Transat 2 days before the flight as I missed my flight during my stay in Nice. They have the "Option Plus" which gives you 2 baggage allowances and some other extras. Plane was an A310-300, pretty old (around 25 years old) There was no personal IFE, moreover I was sitting in a window seat and I kept hitting my head to the side because of the shape of the plane. There were wires going under the armrest (see photo) which seemed weird to me. Seat itself was comfortable and the legroom was fine. Drinks were provided throughout the plane, and I had a full meal (chicken) which wasn't bad at all.

### "said I’d never do it again"
Toronto to Montego Bay. When leaving Toronto they got us all to board the plane and then we sat there for almost 2 hours it started to snow, about an hr and a half of sitting on the plane we were lucky to get out of Toronto. Then on the flight to Jamaica the flight attendants were nice but flustered seemed to have no idea what was going on and the landing was the worst I’ve experienced, then went to claim our bags and both were damaged. Then we booked a catamaran excursion at the resort and it was through air transat the boat company was Chukka and they said drinks were all inclusive come to find out on the boat all they had was beer and rum punch my girlfriend hates both those things so she couldn’t drink then we get to Margaritville thinking maybe they will have better drinks there but they are charging 6-7USD for beer and drinks at a so called all inclusive excursion that’s ridiculous. I have nothing bad to say about the resort we stayed at the Grande Bahia Principe in Runaway Bay it is an amazing resort good food, entertainment, drinks, cleanliness, and staff. As for the trip back we got picked up at 9am from resort we checked our bags at 10:30am and they said the flight was an hour late so we thought nothing of it and went through security then we get up and see the board and it’s delayed 5 hours then we tryed to go out to have a smoke now knowing we’re delayed for so long but they wouldn’t let us out they said we needed an Air Transat rep to let us out so we found them all sitting in waiting chairs doing nothing in the airport and they wouldn’t take us out and we’re laughing about it after the fact very unprofessional. I also flew with Air Transat to Cuba the year before and said I’d never do it again I only went this time because my trip was paid for as a gift but I wouldn’t go again on a trip with them if it was free.

### "Service is bad overall"
Puerto Vallarta to Toronto. The crew was nice and commend them for trying to provide better service, however, the plane flying into my destination and return has no wi-fi service and no entertainment on board, which I think is unbearable for almost 6 hour flight. The plane was also delayed on my first leg of the flight, and on return to YYZ - we didn't get our luggage until after more than 1 hour and 10 minutes. Service is bad overall.

### "abysmal customer service"
Montreal to Cancun. On flight TS560, when I rang to see a flight attendant, nobody ever came to see me. They only came when it was time to serve beverages. When arrived at Cancun Airport, the Air Transat agents in the bus stop were completely disorganized. We had to change 3 times our waiting spot to finally board a shuttle to our hotel. All that after one hour wait on the bus stop. We weren't greeted with any contact at the hotel for the week we were there (like every other airline does). So I missed important information for my trip. For the trip back, we waited for over an hour before being able to board the airplane. The flight attendants got stuck in traffic between their hotel and the airport. No communication was ever given to passengers about the wait. Only when we took off in flight TS561 that the pilot explained to us and apologized. One passenger had grievances about the fact we were not made aware of the wait before, and the flight attendant told her it could have been anything that could've delayed the flight, so we don't need to always communicate delays. When we got back home, I called their customer service, and I was served with total indifference. No excuses given. She even ended the call by saying "We can't please everyone" and "people call us to say that we are better than other companies". Abysmal customer service. I will not book with them for my next trip to the Caribbean.

### "I will give a good rating"
Montréal to Montego Bay. This is a mixed review. On the negative side, I boarded the plane and proceeded to tell one flight attendant that I was going to Montego Bay with my son to celebrate my 50th birthday and that I had been flying for over 25 years and would it be possible during the flight to see the cockpit with the pilots for the first time ever, she said maybe when we land. It’s not that she said no, it was her manner, just uncaring with a phony smile (this trip was very  special for me). On a positive note, there was a very warm, genuine flight attendant on that flight who was kind and definitely belonged in that job. I even thanked her when I disembarked. I will give a good rating to Transat because of the impression that she left with me.

### "they don't care about loyalty"
We booked to depart from Vancouver at 8:20 am on 26 Dec 2017 travelling with a family of 4 to Cancun for 8 days. We live in Victoria and either need to fly to Vancouver (30min) or take a ferry and drive (3 hours). We booked our vacation so we can take a 5:30 am flight from Victoria to Vancouver on the 26th of Dec 2017 (the first flight out from Victoria), arrive in Vancouver by 6:00 am, thus leaving us 2h 20 min to catch the international flight with Air Transat at 8:20 am. This flight from Victoria to Vancouver is $773.84 rtn, plus an overnight on the return in hotel at $289.95 as the flight back from Cancun arrives at 10 pm 3 Jan 2018 and there are no flights from Vancouver to Victoria at that time. Our Air Transat vacation not including the Victoria to Vancouver flights and Hotel in Vancouver on return was paid out as $10,484 to Air Transat on 20 October 2017. 24 November we receive notification that Air Transat changed the flight on 26 Dec 2017 to depart at 6:25 am, which will not leave us the time necessary to make the international connection. We contact Air Transat to discuss our concern and how their flight change will effect us ($420 to change our flights to 8:20 pm on 25 Dec 2017 from 26 Dec 5:30 am from Victoria BC and now a hotel on 25 Dec 2017 at a cost of $265.38). As opposed to sympathy and a helping hand due to their change a month after we booked this vacation and a month remaining before the departure date, we were told it is not their problem and we could cancel our trip and receive a 50% refund or figure out what we need to do to make their flight We have now had 4 vacations plus this one with them ... our loyalty obviously means nothing. Bottom line and money in their pocket seems to be the only option, and how their change has effected loyal customers means nothing. I suggest they don't care about loyalty. I dealt with this issue from 8 am to 11:27 am this morning, being put on hold multiple times, speaking to 4 different people and this is the final decision and offer "We can give you 50% refund on your package and cancel it". Not very impressed at all to say the least.

### "better options exist at similar prices"
Gatwick to Toronto. The flight left on time and arrived on time. Service was not friendly or welcoming. It is an acceptable pragmatic level of service, that suggests a sort of begrudging tolerance for people being on their plane. The food was not great, the salad was served frozen (complete with ice chunks - there was no one in visible sight that ate this) and when we advised the flight team, they were aware of the problem saying they would report the problem back again. Seating is saggy, not uncomfortable but it was not the top of seat comfort that is available on longer distance flights. The onboard entertainment options are terrible, poor movie selection, no tv screens on the two groups of side seats (6 out of 9 seat abreast) and the central 3 seats share common screens appearing every few rows. Air Transat was nominally cheaper than other airlines, but only nominally. The time of their flight was more suitable for our purposes but better options exist at very similar prices.

### "Air Transat is a terrible airline"
Air Transat is a terrible airline. I hope to save you the time, money, and stress that this airline cost me. Honestly, pay the little extra and go with another airline, Air Transat will get that money out of you somehow anyway and probably more. Flew Toronto to Paris. Cons: Online check-in system: 1) It let us check in without informing us that the expiration date I entered on one of the passports did not meet the requirements to fly to Europe. They only told us once we got to the gate that we could not board the plane. Had their system given us an error, we would have had time to get an emergency passport before the flight. They cost us $1000 in extra travel costs as we needed to buy another flight. Their customer service was one of the worst that I've encountered. 2) Checking in online does not save you from their line-ups at the airport. Horrible customer service when you call - takes 20 minutes to get hold of someone and when you do get someone they are rude and will do nothing to help you. No in-flight entertainment, you have to download an app and use your own device which you cannot charge on their planes. Not acceptable for an 8.5 hr flight! Even the things they did have on the app were terrible, random episodes of shows, and outdated movies anyone? Did not even respond to my complaint after we got back on vacation - it seems like they don't care what kind of experience you have, they already have your money. If you have any dietary restrictions at all bring your own food - they may have a meal for you, but any of the snacks will not meet any requirements. Don't drink anything - we had a turbulent flight and the washrooms were not in use for the last 3-4 hours of our 8 hour flight. Pros: The in-flight crew were decent - the crew that checked us in were okay - I guess they didn't lose our luggage so that's something.

### "informed there was a 13 hour delay"
Gatwick to Vancouver. Arrived at checkin and was informed that there was a 13 hour delay and that was it. I later asked about accommodation etc but the check in staff were asking each other about this, we were asked to sit where we could (the checkin area was tucked away in a corner the next floor down from the main checkin area). A chap arrived later and told us we could have a room in the Gatwick Hilton and a voucher for food to the sum of £10 each. We were told how to get to the hotel but no transport was provided (my wife and I have walking disabilities) it took us 20 minutes to walk there. Not at word was mentioned about any form of compensation for the delay. We eventually arrived in Vancouver having effectively lost a day of our trip to Canada. Today is 2nd November and after many efforts by both my UK travel company and myself, apart from a “do not reply to this email”acknowledgment we are still awaiting a human response.

### "customer service was very poor"
Flew Air Transat from Montreal to Punta Cana. I have taken many trips in my life, and this one has got to be the worst one! Terrible from the moment my husband and I booked in September until our return, the customer service was very poor. The agents gave the wrong information, I had to call over 5 times and each agent gave me a different answer. This put a sour taste for our honeymoon. Once on the flight I was even more disappointed. No service, no drinks, no snacks. On our way back, a rude woman in front of me pushed her chair all the way back on me to the point of actually hurting my knees. I asked her politely to move her seat up and she refused. I called the flight attendant and instead of acknowledging my feelings, she tells me to move seats. I did not want to be separated from my husband it was our honeymoon! The flight attendant calls her superior, who was very rude and sarcastic. She told me the same thing as the other stewardess, "switch seats, don't have your table down, you have to cooperate". I did not feel like arguing.

### "cranky and unprofessional"
Flew Air Transat from Glasgow to Vancouver via Toronto. Ticket price was good. Flight to Glasgow was way better than flight home. On the way home we found a few of the stewardesses to be cranky and unprofessional. (Not all) The food was inedible. Seating cramped and Wifi on Cini App kept going down. Why not offer a free fruit, cheese/cracker plate instead of the gross, salty food that was offered? The amount that goes in the garbage is wasteful.

### "uncomfortable and unpleasant flight"
Toronto to Glasgow. We had an overnight flight with our 9 year old daughter. It was awful. The seat space was exceedingly cramped. The cabin area where we were seated was also uncomfortably hot. I went to the flight station at the back of the plane to ask for water for my daughter and explained that it was very hot in our area. The flight attendant handed me a cup of water without any word/comment/eye contact whatsoever (not one word!). Second request for water later on in the flight was met with exactly the same response by the attendant's colleague. The staff interaction was so rude it was quite bizarre. Air Transat provided an extremely uncomfortable and unpleasant flight experience.

### "really good flights"
Toronto to Zagreb, returning from Manchester to Toronto. Both were really good flights. Easy check in, on time departures, early arrivals, really polite cabin staff, decent airline food, clean aircraft, great price. On the outbound flight I ordered the Option Plus meal separately and, while the meal and wine were both good, I did not think that it was worth the $25 extra charge.

### "Very disappointing flight"
Calgary to Vancouver. The worst experience with Air Transat that I have ever had. The 1030pm flight was delayed 50 minutes. I was given the furthest back seat and I realized that there was an audio system in the cabin above my seat. To play the safety video, one of the short flight attendants said 'excuse me' and stepped on the edge of my seat that I was sitting on. Little flesh of my leg got squeezed but I couldn't move for her safety. Not only once but a few times, she stepped on back and forth to play and stop the video and I thought that was rude. After that, during the whole flight, the flight attendants were very loud chatting at the back and I couldn't sleep at all. When we finally arrived, I saw staff unloading bags literally throwing! This airline does not possess manner, customer service nor care. Very disappointing flight with Air Transat and I would never recommend this airline.

### "cabin crew were very professional and pleasant"
I had a good flight from Glasgow to Toronto with Air Transat. Cabin crew were first class, on my return flight again cabin crew were very professional and pleasant. The aircraft was clean, a good choice of entertainment and the meals were ok. Thank you for a great service and excellent value for money.

### "the worst meal we have had"
Montreal to Prague. We found the dinner offering of a hot sandwich the worst meal we have had on a cross Atlantic flight. We fly 2 times a year across to Europe and this was the worst meal any airline had provided us. We paid for option plus and received no complimentary drink. The bar service after the meal never happened. The quality of the food service would make seriously think about traveling on Air Transat. We had taken a Air Transat flight last June from Venice to Toronto and the food was much better and the complimentary beverage was actually provide. It would seem Air Transat has made a conscious decision to downgrade the quality of the food they serve.

### "did not get our sport luggage"
Vancouver to Amsterdam via Toronto. The worst experience. Apart from the inflight service which was pretty low, we did not get our sport luggage on arrival back home and it's impossible to talk to someone who knows and obtain information about our luggage. It is a nightmare and the company doesn't seem to care. We are left with numbers and email addresses that do not answer and no idea of where our luggage is. I presume it's lost and therefore we are looking into compensation.

### "left without our baggage"
We left Toronto for Lisbon and because of baggage strike the plane got delayed 2.5 hours. Plane left without our baggage, and we had to wait 5 hours at Lisbon airport to give info to lost baggage. There was no Air Transat rep to be seen at all. Baggage took 2 days to arrive at the hotel. The food on the plane was awful.

### "Really bad airline to fly"
Manchester to Toronto. Really bad airline to fly. Selected my seats and when went on the plane, some other family was sitting on our seats and when I complained they did not help me at all. I was looking forward for my Canada trip but the start of the journey was very bad and I had to sit on the other seats from my family and my 2 year old son always liked to come to my seat but I could not do that. It made worst when coming back, I selected extra leg room seats and they did not give me that -I booked the seats but they did not give that too and there was not anyone who can help us. I did not want to argue so I just sit at the given seats but I decided that I will never fly with this airline. I travelled a lot but did not have such an experience before.

### "food was actually edible for a change"
This was my annual round trip to visit my family in BC. Have done this trip most years since 1989, so have used a motley collection of airlines. Of them all, Air Transat was the first one I said I'd never use again, back in 2001, but have now been stuck with it for the past three years since it took over my non-stop route. This year was an improvement on last. The food was actually edible for a change. Everything was on time. There were no passport queues when I entered Vancouver. There were no check-in or security queues when I departed Vancouver. The flight was comfortable. The crew were efficient (although I do miss the entertaining Canadian crews of the other airlines). The inflight entertainment was ok with a choice of 30 films. I was not very keen on the purple ceiling lights. It was only in the bathroom did you realise you were on an old plane - the cabin fully refurbished but the wash basins - the old crackle cream ones - were a dead giveaway. Happy to fly with them again.

### "Never fly Air Transat again"
Glasgow to Calgary via Toronto. Of the 4 flights on our return journey only one plane was decent - newish, roomy enough, seat back entertainment system. The other 3 planes were old, cramped and no seat back entertainment which isn't good for a transatlantic flight. Baggage took ages to arrive. We sat on the plane for over an hour in Toronto waiting to depart. On our return the flight that was meant to depart Toronto at nearly midnight was delayed 1.5 hours which is hard going when travelling with a 5 year old child. Most of the staff were pleasant though especially 2 of the female cabin staff who helped me when I fainted on the first better aeroplane. This has not happened to me for years so it was unexpected. They also switched the scheduled type of aeroplane at the last minute on one of our flights probably as not enough bookings so we got a TERRIBLE plane from Toronto to the UK. Never will we fly Air Transat again.

### "customer service does not care"
Calgary to Amsterdam. I found such a bargain with direct flight to Amsterdam, also with 7 hours between flights on the way back via Vancouver I would be able to set several business meetings with my partners. Oh, was I wrong! The results are: I had to pay nearly $1000 for additional flights, nearly missed my conference, had to cancel my meetings in Vancouver, and from Vancouver to Calgary flew in so old aircraft. if you are going to use the service of Air Transat, be warned: the plane may be late 1-3 hours; customer service does not care about you and refuse to help you. The company is so badly organized, that one hand does not know what the other does: for example, we were told to take our luggage in Vancouver and give it back to Transat desk worker, who was supposed to check it in again. We spent an hour running all over the airport trying to find one Air Transat worker. No luck: they did not know that their own plane was late 2.5 hours and left. Later, they asked us to pay again for luggage, because "we kept it for too long".

### "thankful that Transat has broken the monopoly"
Flew London Gatwick to Vancouver. Air Transat is exactly what it says on the tin - it's North America’s best leisure airline. It leads WestJet and Rouge, and probably isn't as good as Air Canada or British Airways, but I saved 400 CAD / 250 GBP by flying with them. On both the outward and return leg, I pass chaotic check-in desks for other airlines to find no queue on Air Transat. Easy and fast. While Transat are not in the Gatwick Connects scheme, you can use it to self-connect to other airlines on arrival (only) at Gatwick. I connected to easyJet very smoothly (max 6 hours later) which saved me taking by bags to a different terminal and queuing up to check in again. This option was cheaper than the other connections I could have booked, all of which involved late night arrivals at both ends. The plane was clean and new with mood lighting. A couple of the seats had issues - on one occasion a passenger near me had a faulty headphone jack so they upgraded him to Option Plus (comfort kit, free alcoholic drinks) and gave him the gourmet meal. On another occasion, the passenger reported a headrest issue and as there were still 15 minutes before departure, they had a couple of mechanics come and fix it. Basic but passable hot meal (with one free glass of wine or beer) as well as a pizza slice on the way out. On the way back, the meal was a choice of hot sandwich and the snack was a small slice of carrot cake, filling but a bit cheap on a 9-hour flight. Still, I could have upgraded to the gourmet meal for C$25 each way and then I would have eaten better than on AC/BA economy and still saved. Also, my fellow passenger had the Option Plus wine which was much nicer than the free stuff. Again, if it's important to you, you pay a little extra and you can get it. The crew were nice on the outward flight and polite enough on the inward leg, but I senses some morale issues. Inflight entertainment on screens - not a great selection (39 movies, 20 or so music artists, a small selection of TV shows) but you didn't have to download an app and stream it on your own device (WJ/Rouge) and everyone also gets a USB port for charging. Flights delayed by about 30 minutes on both occasions. All in all, I would always choose a full service carrier if the prices were the same. That being said, I'm thankful that Transat has broken the monopoly. With so many things you can upgrade (before or during the flight), you can basically choose the flight you want and the price you want.

### "never recommend this airline"
Toronto to Cancun. Been to Mexico so many times with different airlines but this has been the worst experience ever with Air Transat. I had the worst experience with the cabin crew as I was waiting for 2 hours to get a glass of water after asking so many times and got a bad attitude from the crew. I would never recommend this airline to anyone.

### "most horrible experience"
Toronto to Montreal. The most horrible experience ever. This 1 hour flight turned into a 5 hour nightmare. The flight was suppose depart at 6pm but due to fuel issues got pushed back. Apparently the fuel was delayed and they missed their slot on the runway so it got pushed to 8:30pm. That was not the end of the nightmare. After arriving at Montreal airport, they inform us that there was a mixup with the luggages and we ended up waiting 3+ hours for our luggages. The crew didn't know what was going on and there was no communication whatsoever. Can't believe such a short flight can be such a hellish experience. I fly frequently and have never experienced such travesty from any other airlines. Air transat was the first airline I tried and I thought it should be fine since it's a short flight but boy was I wrong.

### "crew were friendly and helpful"
Gatwick to Toronto. Was nearly an hour late departing. My wife and I had club class seats 2A and 2C, the seats were quite wide but the legroom in row 2 was very poor for the price. The option plus seats on the row behind had far more room than us. If you can be sure to book the first row as you can stretch out as much as you want. The heat on the aircraft was ridiculous made worse as there are no personal air vents above your head, be sure to bring plenty of water on board as you will need it. Waiting to take off at Gatwick and coming in to land at Toronto was so hot I thought I was going to pass out! I have never experienced this before on any other flight that I have taken. Food and on board is included in the price, you are advised to pre-book your meal by the airline as if you don't you will have to have whatever is left. Personally I thought that this was a strange thing to do but I guess it's a cost cutting measure. Flight was very smooth with no problems and a good choice of inflight entertainment. There are USB ports on each seat so able to charge gadgets. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Toilets were reasonably clean but could of been better given that they were only being used by 12 passengers and the crew. The flight arrived on time, but had to wait for almost 2 hours at Toronto for our bags as they had decided to put a flight from Glasgow on the same luggage carousel as ours, so had to wait for all of their luggage to be claimed before ours was put on. Think there were 4 or 5 carousels not being used in baggage reclaim area. This wasn't a very pleasant experience as you were stuck with around 400 other increasingly angry passengers in a relatively small space. I'm assuming it was like this because Air Transat are a small airline and only have access to a limited number of carousels. Probably wouldn't use them again unless I had to.

### "I was the one stranded"
Toronto to Birmingham. Having traveled with Air Transat, due to a family emergency with less than 24 hours notice, I was happy to catch any flight out of Toronto to the UK as fast as possible. Unfortunately, my family emergency continued on and I missed my flight back to YYZ on my scheduled date. Air Transat had the opportunity to rebook me, at a full price fare, aside from the fact that no one in customer service could have been bothered. I was placed on hold, paying international rates, to be told "too bad ". I was well aware of the fact it was "too bad", as I was the one stranded but at no point provided with any viable option to get home. I used WOW air to fly me home. I have yet to receive any response from Transat.

### "absolutely terrible"
Never again. Flew Air Transat from Toronto to Cancun on June 17, 2017 to be returning June 24, 2017. Booked Club Class for family of three including one child. Selected Club Class meals when upgrading. I had called a week prior to my departure to confirm meals, they did not have them on file, booked a child's meal both down and back. Flight was delayed 7 hours at Toronto Airport. Flight was delayed twice. The second time the flight was delayed, everyone was sitting at the gate waiting for the 1630 delayed departure. Air Transat changed the time to 1830 without informing the passengers waiting. I just happened to notice the change while walking into the airport. I asked the gate agents if that was in fact correct, I was told to "wait for an announcement" The "announcement" came approximately 20 minutes later. A $100.00 voucher was told would be given to passengers. As of 8 days later, no voucher. Note, this voucher would be given for another flight on Air Transat, not sure who would want to deal with them again. After paying $1000.00 to upgrade to Club Class, Air Transat decided to bump passengers from economy to club who were complaining. One couple who complained the loudest got a free ride in Club beside my family's $1000.00 upgrade - really fair. The best part came on departure in Cancun. They did not have our meals we ordered. So after paying, my child had no meal. He was given bread to eat. Please note, that this flight was during dinner time. Baggage in Toronto was just as bad. 90 minutes for bags to come to baggage hall. Priority bags did not come out first, in fact they came out last. What a waste. This will be my last flight with this joke of an airline. It is no wonder Air Canada has been so successful, this airline is absolutely terrible.

### "courteous and professional"
We had return trips between Manchester and Toronto and were pleasantly surprised with Air Transat. Outward trip was delayed due to blocked sewage pipes - but I'm glad they did delay in order to fix it as I wouldn't want to be on a transatlantic flight with no toilet! The delay did not concern us due to our hotel check in time. The return trip was on time and arrived around 20 minutes early. The cabin staff were courteous and professional and the captain kept us well informed. Food was adequate. Legroom on both flights was good (I'm 5 foot 10) and seat width OK. All in all, I would recommend Air Transat, particularly based on the price paid.

### "staff rude, unfriendly and unprofessional"
Easily the worst international flight I have ever taken. From Toronto to London, the plane was freezing cold, to the point where several passengers around me were shivering, while the stewardesses endlessly touted $9 blankets for sale. Bright purple light beamed down on all passengers for almost the entire duration of the overnight, red-eye flight to London. It was eerie, obnoxious and nauseating. What about giving us time to sleep? More importantly, the flight staff were rude, unfriendly and unprofessional from when I boarded the plane to when I left. When it came to meals, they practically threw the 'food' on our trays like we were pigs on a truck. To top it all off, Air Transat took five weeks to respond to my customer service inquiry regarding my negative experience: they were rude on the phone, and they sent me a form email as their response.

### "lack of any customer service"
Glasgow to Toronto. I and my extended family have used Transat for years on both transatlantic and for Mexican package holidays from Toronto. My recent trip to the UK was the usual packed old A310 with centre aisle monitors and crackly headsets. My wife got a vegan/vegetarian meal on both directions which looked and tasted awful and were served 25 minutes before everyone else and the drinks. My kids meals got screwed up and my meal was nice and cool on the way out but the beef with mash potato was not bad on the way back. Don't expect iPad or samsung devices to get wifi unless you pre down load an app or have a degree in overcoming your Android settings to allow it to work. The icing on the cake for me was the £65/$115cd I was charged for a picture that was 20" x 20" and weighed 5kg at Glasgow check in. First if you are a Canadian resident but travel on UK passports don't expect to be able to check in coming into Canada. So no way to check excess bag prices or add one. Straight away female is up to me and asking if it was an extra bag....egh no it's a bubble wrapped picture 1 inch wider than the carry one cage thing. Sorry £65 please. So she explains it to the supervisor I asked to see who walks up and does not even try and be nice with a "How can I help" just walks up and say "I'm the supervisor" on good start thanks. So our bags weights were 20/18/15 and 18, you are allowed 23kgs, well under our hand luggage were all small body bags. I asked could I just carry the picture and have it put into the hold at the door like the strollers etc - no it's a bag Sir, no it's not a bag it's a picture, no it's an excess bag sir. Then I'm told if I had gone As an Options or club customer I would have got an extra bag! Oh thanks that's great advise for a young family on a budget. Bottom line is I won't fly with them again and I will do my Mexico trips through Costco. So congrats Air Transat your $110/£65 has in fact cost you $3500 for next year's transatlantic flights and $6000 for my Mexico trip in the spring. Did I mention left late and arrived late both ways which according to the latest results is Transat speciality - dead last on the list I saw. They used to be good but old A310s, miserable looking staff and lack of any attempt at customer service for loyal customers has just cost them my business.

### "poor service of my upgrade"
Where to begin? I paid for their Options Plus but didn't receive the full benefit of the service. The service on the ground is terrible at the airport, both Toronto and Holguin. While I was waiting to board the flight in Toronto, the gate staff told me I had to check my bag. They took it away from me and said I was only allowed one bag. I had a small carry on and a computer bag. I was upset and protested that I was allowed one bag and a personal item. They were rude about it and said I was only allowed one bag. I complained to the supervisor and she eventually agreed that I was right. I got my bag back along with some dirty looks from the gate staff. This is how they treat their upgraded guests! At Holguin airport, my luggage was supposed to be among the first off the plane. But it was the last. I was told it was lost after waiting an hour and 20 minutes. I went to do a lost luggage claim but it suddenly was found a few minutes later. No support from AT. On the return trip, they did not let Options Plus customers board first. It was a free for all with no info on the gate or boarding procedures. My luggage was not among the first off the plane again. I waited over 20 minutes after the luggage started coming down the baggage carrousel. I asked the AT desk at Toronto airport why and he avoided the reason and told me to phone in a complaint. When I called AT customer service after the trip to discuss the poor service of my upgrade, I was told they would investigate and get back to me within 2 days. I'm still waiting 10 days later. I have had previous bad trips with Air Transat, so this will be my last trip with them.

### "they provided terrible service"
Air Transat is the worst airline I have ever flown with. They provided terrible service throughout the flight and experience. We gate checked the stroller for my baby, and when we arrived in Toronto, were told that it would be with the luggage. They claimed that there were complimentary strollers for us to use, but there were none to be found. I had to walk through the airport carrying the baby, carry-on bag, purse and diaper bag. There was absolutely no help. When we arrived to Canada in the middle of winter, from the Caribbean, none of our luggage arrived. We were left with no warm clothing since we live in the Caribbean. Instead of being honest from the start, they had us wait around the luggage claim for over 3 hours, insisting that the luggage was coming. After they finally admitted it was not, we had to wait in a huge line to claim the luggage. Again, zero assistance even with a screaming baby. We were called and told the luggage was on its way, it never arrived. It took several phone calls and arguements for them to finally bring out luggage, which supposedly was there the whole time. Even writing to complain about the experience was useless. They took months to respond, and when they did, they offered a measly compensation, which was in Canadian dollars even though we bought and paid for the flights in US dollars. I would rather pay double to fly a different airline.

### "old airplane but in general not bad"
Toronto to Saint Martin. The flight was not late. Good leg room in the 2x2 seats at the back of the plane. Was seated in 27 A . Service ok but on a 4 hours flight nothing was free like peanuts. Only free juice or water or café. So you will need to bring something to eat all the time. I did order into the way back and not that pricy and basic food. For leisure best seat and good comfort compared to Air Canada rouge. Also make sure to bring iPad or other tablet to use the entertainment system. Good selection of movie. Missing some usb plugs. Was old airplane but in general not bad.

### "we were treated very well"
Flew from Saskatoon to Puerto Vallarta in January and stayed at the Friendly Vallarta. Our return flight was delayed due to mechanical problems and as a result we were laid over for an additionally day in Puerto Vallarta. We were treated very well by Air Transat in securing overnight accommodations at the Sheridan including transportation and meals. The return flight was the following day and the service by the Airtransport personnel was excellent. They even gave us a complimentary meal along with a travel voucher for a future flight. I have nothing but admiration for the staff and the airline and any future trips will definitely be booked with Air Transat.

### "review is to complement the staff"
Porto to Montreal via Toronto. Air Transat is the 'work-horse' of airlines. For a lower price, I don't get 'frills' nor do I expect any. My review is to complement the staff on both my outbound and inbound flight. They are polite, service-oriented and efficient. There were quite a number of passengers on the flight that were pressing the call bell excessively. The flight attendants were gracious and helpful. I could not believe their patience, especially with some unruly passengers who refused to sit down when we were going through turbulence. I just wanted to give a thumbs up to the professional crew. Will continue to use Air Transat in the future.

### "only one person serving club class"
Flew Air Transat from Edmonton to Cancun. Waited in line for 15 minutes to check in, only one person serving club class. The flight attendant didn't smile once and sat and read the paper about 50% of the flight, there was only 10 of us that he needed to be served. Meal was awful, the pastries were to hard to eat and not even 2 hours into the flight we were told they were out of alcohol. The flight was 5 hrs and 20 mins.

### "enjoy flying Club Class"
❎ Unverified |  We flew Calgary to Puerto Vallarta and back again in Club Class, as we had such a great experience last time and this time took our adult son who had just graduated University and we needed to celebrate! Both flights attendants were great but on our flight back to Calgary Sunday Feb 26 flight TS319 our attendant was exceptional. Professional, cheerful and upbeat which made our flight back to the cold bearable! We so enjoy flying Club Class - so worth it to start our vacay this way!

### "there is not enough space"
Air Transat has taken maximizing the number of passengers they can carry over customer comfort and safety to a new and disappointing level. I was assigned seat 11A which is the row in front of the emergency exit over the wing. As I found my seat, I heard the woman behind me complaining at having paid a $50 premium for the extra leg room that the seats by the emergency exit usually offer. Usually the spacing of the rows is wider to allow access to the door in an emergency. Even Air Transat's website shows the seating by the exits to be this way but on the plane I was on, they removed the seat immediately beside the door but left the two beside it, presumably 12B and 12C. The spacing of the rows appears identical meaning that in an emergency we would have to pass through the seat row to get to the door. It turns out that the extra leg room she paid for is actually just the extra space afforded her by the seats in row 11 being locked in the upright position at all times. In my opinion, there is not enough space between rows of seats for anyone over 5' to assume the crash position they always tell us about in the pre-flight safety announcement. I spent the entire 5 hour flight from San Jose to Toronto sitting straight up with the back of the seat in front of me inches from my face. Three days after the flight I still have a stiff neck. If they are going to charge the people behind me a premium for their increased comfort at the expense of my discomfort, I think they should be passing that money on to me as a discount! I would have passed on the incentive and chosen a more comfortable seat. I was also concerned with my seatbelt. It seemed badly worn. I could pull the belt through the buckle easily. I have my doubts that it would provide much restraint in an emergency. I am not new to flying, and I don't recall ever seeing a belt this loose before but it may be normal. I found it less concerning than the restricted access to the emergency door. The flight attendants seemed stressed and were a bit short with people. I'm guessing it is not a lack of friendliness but more too many passengers per attendant. I cannot comment on the food because credit card is the only accepted method of payment and my card was stowed below. How can you force your customers to buy their meal and then not accept cash? Check the size of your carry on bags. Air Transat's maximum dimensions are smaller than those allowed by many carriers. My industry standard bag was one inch too long when you included the wheels. They say on their website that if you bring your bag onto the plane and it doesn't meet their dimensions you will be charged $75 to check it vs $25 to check it during check in. They didn't push it in my case but the threat is still there. Profit over safety is no way to run an airline. Spend the extra money on an airline that takes your comfort and safety seriously. When I was shopping flights, the difference between Canada's major airline and Air Transat was $25. After spending two weeks in Costa Rica and feeling so relaxed, winding up with a stiff neck that has lasted three days on my return flight has been very disappointing. I would not recommend Air Transat.

### "bit cramped and uncomfortable"
❎ Unverified |  All in all an ok experience with Air Transat flying from Toronto Pearson to Holguin International. Customer service was a good aspect of the flight, possibly even the best. The food and beverage options were the biggest let downs. Food was not free, I could even say highly overpriced and all I got was a small sandwich. Seating was just ok, a bit cramped and uncomfortable for a 4 hour flight. It was quite cold in the cabin.

### "staff excellent, friendly and helpful"
❎ Unverified |  Flew Air Transat from London Gatwick to Toronto. Other reviews of Air Transat stress the inedible food, poor entertainment, narrow seats and rude staff. My experience differed in one vital area - the staff were excellent, friendly and helpful. They went out of their way to re-seat passengers to minimise discomfort and were happy to help with any requests. This makes all the difference and thanks to them my overall experience was positive and pretty much in line with what I'd expect from a budget transatlantic crossing. Forewarned is forearmed though. I would advise buying a sandwich before or eating in the airport rather than going for the Euro Bistro menu as it really is horrible. And make sure you have your own entertainment packed. And yes, this is not an airline for the big hipped or broad shouldered! Judge how important those things are to you before you go for that apparent bargain. But don't worry about the staff.

### "I will not recommend"
Gatwick to Toronto return. 8 hours flight and no entertainment. The staff don't even have a pen to fill up the landing card. I paid for £323 and now I want to change one week early, they are asking the difference £250 + tax = £313. The new ticket $309 which is in pound around £190. I think is better to pay bit extra money but travel with good airline - this airline only £20 cheaper than Air Canada. I will not recommend Air Transat.

### "delayed 11 hours and 45 min"
Calgary to Cancun with Air Transat. Delayed 11 hours and 45 min for our 5 year anniversary because of a mechanical problem that they waited to fix until it was time to board. To compensate us we recieved a $20 food voucher. We are paying $800 a day to sit at an airport, thanks for the terrible service.Will never book or recommended a flight with this airline again.

### "experience was absolutely terrible"
Edmonton to Cancun return. My fiancé and I along with friends decided to travel with Air Transat after seeing the good deals on expedia, but they are right “you do get what you pay for”. We flew from Edmonton on January 22 to Cancun, a 6-hour flight. On our flight, we received two beverages that were half empty and a mint before we landed. We were extremely cold on the flight and hungry as they did not have enough food to purchase!? We bought an all-inclusive package from Transat and for 6 hours we got one cup of drink and one mint and no food to purchase cause they ran out. On our way back on January 29th, the shuttle which was suppose to pick us up and take us to the airport showed up almost hour late, did not have all of our names on the list and they fit 14 people in a 7 seater van. I had to sit on my Fiancés lap for 45 minutes with stacks of suitcases behind all of our heads. Absolutely unsafe, I will never fly or travel with Air Transat as they have put all of our safety at risk. Our experience was absolutely terrible.

### "I should have spent extra money"
Vancouver to London Gatwick return. I chose Air Transat as it was a couple of hundred dollars cheaper than other airlines. In retrospect, I should have spent the extra money flying with a better airline. Flying out, the plane was delayed by an hour and a half, and when I reached London I had to wait an hour for the luggage to come through, as they were "having trouble getting the bags off the plane". On the return leg, I got to the check in desk to be told that the flight was delayed by an hour and a half (this turned out to be closer to 2.5 hours), no apology was offered. The food served during the 10 hour flight was a sandwich. That was it. And only one free alcoholic drink. Blankets were available at a cost.

### "flight attendant was amazing"
I flew home to Toronto from Punta Cana Friday January 20th at 2:30 pm Dominican Republic time. I picked up a virus or parasite on my trip and was quite ill by the time we boarded. I would like to say the flight attendant was amazing. She asked a lady beside my wife and I if she wouldn't mind changing seats so that I could have more room to stretch out to sleep. She not only did that she got cold towels for my head and neck and gave me a blanket. She also gave my wife a bottle of champagne and a glass of wine to the lady who graciously changed seats. She went above and beyond the call of duty and honestly I don't know how I could have gotten through the flight home if it wasn't for her. She sat in the jump seat near the exit I don't know her name but she should be commended for her compassion. I will never forget the kindness of your flight attendant.

### "it was what we could call a dry flight"
Air Transat flight from Cancun to Montreal was 3 hours late while we were sat waiting on the plane. Our first small glass of water came more than two hours after boarding the plane and the 2nd one more than three hours after the first one. We had to pay for the lousy sandwiches left that we wouldn't even have needed if there hadn't had a delay because we would have lunched at destination before the lunch was served in the plane more than 6 hours after boarding. There was no water in the restrooms and also no hot beverages available. It was what we could call a dry flight.

### "the delay was being short staffed"
Vancouver to Cancun return with Air Transat. Our problem really started on the return trip. After boarding the plane everyone had to sit and wait for 45 min because they were waiting for some of their crew members to arrive from another flight. That delay pushed the landing back to 12.15 am (Vancouver time). The worst is yet to come - after customs we had to wait 2.5 hrs for our luggage to arrive. The Air Transat counter staff were absolutely usless and couldn't offer a proper explanation of why the luggage were not coming or offerings any kind of solution. A lot of passengers with small kids got fed up and left. Finally around 2.30 am the luggage started to come up on the carousel. Later on we found out the reason for the delay was being short staffed. They had scheduled one crew member to empty a 300 passenger aircraft (saving money or a mistake I do not know). It has been 4 days since we returned and no one from the company has boderred to return my calls or offer an apology or explanation.

### "seats are very narrow and hard"
Flew from Vancouver to London Gatwick. No food for 10.5 hours, what are they thinking. We fly every year to Portugal and have used Air Transat every time. The food was always quite good. However on this trip they have stopped serving proper food. We were delayed an hour so sitting on the plane for 10.5 hours. We expected the usual tray of food, salad, main course, desert, but no they have stopped this and now all you get is a choice of 5 different bread rolls. That's it, for a 9.5 hour flight - one lousy bread roll, I could not eat mine it was stodge and tasted foul. Just slices of meat and bread, no salad or anything else inside. So I had nothing to eat on this flight. I asked for an alternative that was not bread and they did not have anything to offer. The seats are very narrow and hard, no lumbar support and virtually no foam in the seat part, like sitting on a plank. We will not fly with them again.

### Air Transat customer review
Toronto to Santa Domingo. I was just checking on the price of our next trip with Air Transat and what a huge surprise. The club class we usually take is now priced at $450.00 each. We use this only because of the leg room and supposedly the larger seats. Last year the seats weren't much bigger than the regular seats. We ended up having only pasta type meals. I thought for paying that outrageous money we would get steak but not. We had a small glass of sparkling wine and never offered another. Remember there are only 12 seats in this section so staff are not over worked at all. When we asked for some little snacks the staff looked at us as if we had 2 heads. We each in that 4 hour flight got 2 drinks and we had to ask for the second ones. There is nothing in the package that is worth that much money other than to select your seats, a bit more luggage and not even the best service. You had to ask for everything. I felt for that price, we should have had more drinks and a real good meal. Don't ever book club class as it's really not worth the money or the time. Unfortunately, they have gouged all of us that travel because of this club class. My husband has a hard time walking so it's closer to the exit doors but not impressed at all with the price.

### "would not book Option Plus"
Manchester to Toronto and return with Air Transat. I booked Optional Plus. Going from Manchester I thought Option Plus would have boarded amongst the first passengers but myself and others were disappointed as we were not called first. My return journey was hell. I booked a seat and of the three seats in front one was empty and a passenger from the middle seat moved in front of me and at once put their seat back. The passenger would not put up the seat for me to eat my meal. I asked the air hostesses to ask them to put their seat up but they refused. They eventually moved the passenger to another seat and asked me to move to the seat in front where they said I would have more room. I did this reluctantly as I had booked the seat I wanted. I moved and the person in front proceeded to put their seat down again. We did not have the next meal as there was too much turbulence, however, the meals were horrendous anyway so not missing much. I did think we should of been allowed a drink. On arrival at Manchester I was delayed as my suitcase was missing. I filled in a form and given a number to ring next day. I rang and was told my bag was in Gatwick. Although I arrived home Tuesday morning I didn't receive my suitcase until Friday after 5.00pm. I would definitely think twice about flying with Air Transat again and definitely would not book Option Plus.

### "no value for the money"
Toronto to Punta Cana with Air Transat. We purchased the "Option Plus" but were very disappointed. There were lots of passengers travelling with Option Plus so there was no advantage as the line ups were longer than the regular lines. People were using Option Plus lines but hadn't paid for it. Service from Punta Cana was very unorganized and slow. The snack box provided had terrible food both coming and going. On the flight down we were told that the plane had been loaded incorrectly and they had no ear phones. We will not purchase Option Plus in the future as there was virtually no value for the money.

### "extremely nice cabin staff"
London Gatwick to Vancouver with Air Transat. Superb flight, extremely nice cabin staff, cannot understand previous reviews on food, as we found the food excellent, lots to drink, tea, coffee water. Plenty of films etc on the touch screen, one of the best airlines to Canada I have ever used.

### "very disappointed with the food provided"
We flew with Air Transat to Vancouver on 9th September and returned on 24th September, we chose Option+, we were very disappointed with the food provided on this long haul flight. Our inflight meal consisted of a pulled pork panini from the bistro menu, same on return flight. It was disgusting, near the end if the flight they then gave a piece of pizza. Coming home was even worse, breakfast consisted of a wet piece of cake, think it should have been Madeira cake but couldn't tell. I would advise you to take your own food on this flight. Also coming home it was a night flight and the heat on the plane was unbearable. I did ask for it to be turned down but this never happened. We paid over £1500.00 for this flight and would not travel with them again.

### "smooth and memorable for us"
Toronto to Varadero return. They say first impressions last. What a great opportunity to travel with Air Transat. My husband and I were a little bit worried about flying with our 9 months old but the staff of this airline made it smooth and memorable for us. From the beginning they made sure we have everything we needed, I wanted hot water before taking off and one of the flight attendants grabbed the bottle and came right back with hot water. Would you like extra blankets? How about a pillow for your baby? When we got to Toronto airport, we noticed that our baby's stroller is damaged so we seeked guidance in how to make a damage claim. The gentleman filling the report was very understanding and helpful. The next day, after contacting the repair shop that we were referred to by Air Transat, told us that they don't fix the brand of our stroller and we have to contact the airline and get help directly from them. All the agents we spoke to were helpful . The manager contacted me and listened to me explaining the situation and the condition of the stroller and of course asked me to provide and show proofs and within just a couple of days they contacted me and told us they're going to replace the stroller for us.

### "value for money is definitely not there anymore"
Flew Club Class and found that the value for money is definitely not there anymore. I have flown Air Transat Club Class at least once a year for many years now and the service and food have changed dramatically. Check-in at Toronto going to Dublin, I had to wait while the Club Class area was used for families. On the aircraft, we waited for quite a while to get service after takeoff and the crew were not very present so I had to get up a couple of times and go to the galley to get what I needed. The crew did not keep economy passengers from using the front washroom, which is supposed to be for Club only. This flight was after 11 pm, so they served a light snack (which was terrible) and then breakfast before landing. Choice of 2 types of omelette or fruit and a bagel. Really? The return flight was no better. On the initial beverage service, I was missed and had to ask for a drink. The food was not very good and the bread was brought around after most people had finished their meals. Again, people from economy used the Club washrooms with no crew checking it. I am not a snob, but this is why I pay extra. The selection of movies an d entertainment is not good at all. Club Class is not anywhere close to what it used to be.

### "good for a charter flight"
Toronto to Rome. First time travel with Air Transat, I would say the flight attendants and their services were good, catering wise was acceptable, maybe they should clean the toilets a bit more often. This is a good standard for a charter flight, for the money I paid. The one thing I can't understand is we flew with a A330 from Rome to Toronto on 30/09/16 and coming back with Airbus 321! I was not aware of the enroute of the flight, however flying 8 hours and 30 mins with this little aircraft is inappropriate. The safety belt sign were most of the time on, the whole trip was rather bumpy. I sure will give it a second thought next time I fly to Canada.

### "shall look for alternatives"
My wife and I flew Air Transat Toronto to Dublin return. Flights left on time but crew not attentive. Entertainement is a small monitor in the middle seat section, so small that one could not see anything. Food was most unappetizing and gross - next time I shall bring my own food. Seats too narrow and worn out. No pillows or blankets provided. Bathrooms dirty already before flight took off. I shall look for alternatives before flying this airline again.

### "seats are most uncomfortable"
My friend and I traveled Air Transat from Vancouver to London Gatwick on 1st October. It is the worst airline I have ever used. The seats are very close together and most uncomfortable. Food is appalling, crew looked embarrassed at having to hand it out. Not once did the female attendant smile or say thank you.

### "left disappointed by this experience"
Air Transat Flight TS564, September 22nd, Toronto - Manchester, A310, C-GSAT. Having flown in Air Transat Club Class many times, I was left disappointed by this experience. Check in fine at Toronto, but we tried to explain to the agent that we were entitled to fastlane security. After looking completely confused she stated that only British Airways got fastlane security from this Terminal, we have had fastlane from Vancouver and apparently it is only operated at 'selected' airports despite Pearson being a hub. At the gate, the crew were standing around waiting for the aircraft to be taxied round which caused a 40 minute delay. Thankfully as Club we were boarded first on to an aged A310 in fair condiiton. No amenity packs left on our seats, and when we asked for one, we got a confused reply saying they had not been left on the aircraft. We were offered an 'option plus' pack but we declined. Not the fault of the airline, but there was a baby screaming at certain times throughout the flight. Why anyone would want to take a baby in Club Class is beyond me. Also, there was a fault with the seat back TV as it had a red tinge in certain areas of the screen. Served the usual sparkling wine before take-off but service lacked from this point on. After take-off, we waited at least 1 hour before anything was served. The stewardess serving the Club section came round and asked for people's menu choices and eventually we had to attract the attention of another stewardess to get a drink. We did try the call button but being a 25 year old aircraft it didn't work. Word must have reached the purser of our frustration as she personally came to speak to us. When we informed her of the lack of service, she first said that 'there was possible turbulence and they may not serve drinks', after further conversations she then apologised and explained that 'the stewardess hadn't been with them long'. After this we were served in the way that Air Transat normally treats it's Club passengers. The Club Class on Air Transat is usually great, but we found on this occasion, the sense of exclusivity which we paid a lot extra for was really lacking. You are made to feel special with fastlane security, priority boarding, etc, but the inexperience of the crew and lack of facilities would sadly not make us choose Air Transat again.

### "the worst long haul flights"
Manchester to Toronto with Air Transat. This was the first time we had travelled with this airline and it will definitely be the last. The worst long haul flights we have ever experienced. On the outbound flight it was an hour and a half before we were offered a drink and on the inbound flight it was two and a half hours. Completely unacceptable, especially, on a seven hour flight. The food was disgusting. The choice of "complimentary" food was sandwiches, none of which looked very appetising. There was one "snack" per flight. One was an insipid lump of pizza and the other was a piece of cake. The seats are so narrow you have to lift the arms in between to gain another couple of inches of room to try to make it a little more comfortable. In future we will avoid this airline like the plague.

### "service was not up to much"
Toronto to Birmingham with Air Transat. After an 8 hour delay on the outward journey, we were all tired before we started. The service was not up to much, the food was not up to much and the inflight entertainment was also not up to much. Due to the delay, the crew had amassed their hours in midflight, so we had to divert to Montreal to change crew and refuel, making us even later arriving in Toronto - approx. 10 hours late. Since returning, I have tried to to contact them by email (10 days ago) without success and they will wonder why I will not recommend them again.

### "food price is grossly over inflated"
My mother and I flew Air Transat from Edmonton to Cancun via Calgary in August, and while I have come to expect low frills from many airlines, I was rather disappointed in this flight. The staff were excellent, friendly, courteous. Our ground transportation from the airport to our resort and back was also top notch. Due to the number of people going to our area in Akumal, we only had 5 people in a van on the way out, and in a truck on the way back. It allowed us to zip along the highway faster than in a coach and we made it to our destination with day light to spare, which was wonderful. The flight itself though - entertainment there was none. We had traveled with Sunwing back in October and I had been disappointed that we only had drop down tv's, and so everyone had to watch the same show. With Air Transat, we didn't even have tv's. 6 hours with nothing to to help pass the time. If you fly, pack accordingly. Food is only available for purchase and that purchase price is grossly over inflated ($3 for a chocolate bar). What I disliked is that they didn't even provide a snack. Onboard bathrooms were poor - I've flown quite a bit over the years and I have never smelled an airline bathroom that smelled so strongly. The smell was the same on the flight there and the flight home. My mom has flown Air Transat for a flight from Edmonton to London a few years ago, and had no complaints. But this flight was boring and it's price did not reflect the amenities you were giving up.

### "left disappointed and angry"
My trip to Vancouver required a stop in Toronto and boarding another plane for Vancouver. Following the excellent service and standard of comfort on the transatlantic flight, which I have taken many times before, I was confronted with a very poor alternative for the second leg of my journey. The Club Class of domestic flights is just economy seating with a blanket and plastic bag accessories. Having just travelled for a number of hours my main objective was to sleep the final leg of my journey. Consequently I was not interested in free wine or what looked like unappetizing food. The seat was a small economy class version with little leg room. My window seat proved to be very cold and sleep was continually interrupted by the seemingly continuos queue for the forward bathroom. Cabin lights were not lowered for much of the flight and the service from the crew was at best indifferent. Instead of arriving at my destination refreshed from a good rest I was stiff and tired. It was only later that I discovered that there is no Club Class seating on domestic despite having been assured at booking that I could expect the usual transatlantic standard. I have resolved to never again take a connecting flight to Canada again with this airline. After many years of satisfaction this trip left me disappointed and angry.

### "not particularly comfortable"
Barcelona to Toronto via Montréal with Air Transat. The flight there was rather uncomfortable due to the seats being so narrow. The staff tried their best, however that couldn't compensate for the minimal leg room and cramped space. The bistro menu sandwiches were mediocre. If they had been prepared fresh it would have been tasty, however all of them contain sauce which makes them very soggy and wet when they are reheated and served. I had the brie and ham option. On the flight back, I discovered that the best menu option is probably the vegetable maki, as it contains no sauce and is thereby not soggy when they serve it. They give you cute chopstick to eat the maki, and the package comes with little packets of soy sauce and wasabi you can put on the sushi yourself. On the flight back we purchased the 2 seat option which was much more comfortable than the standard 3 seats stuck together by the window. It is an extra 50 dollars per person but well worth it. Overall Air Transat is a cheap option that will get you from point A to point B safely, but not particularly comfortable.

### "cabin staff were amazing"
Calgary to Manchester. I was dubious to fly with Air Transat again, even though my trips to the UK, from Canada over the last 25 years have been with this airline. However their prices are amazing and a non stop flight is a must for a nervous passenger such as myself. I needn't have worried - the flight was smooth and relaxing, new planes and TV connection could not have been better. The cabin staff were amazing, nothing was too much trouble for them. PS: Take your own food, it is really bad !

### "did not receive any updates"
We had a short flight from Vancouver to Calgary with Air Transat. Our flight was hopping around from Toronto to Calgary to Vancouver and onwards, which explained the delay that we experienced, as the flight had just left Toronto when we arrived at our designated time at Calgary Airport (not a good sign). However, we did not know this until we heard the person ahead of us getting frustrated with the ground staff over the delay. The departures board had not been updated and still showed the original time. Furthermore, when we received our boarding passes from the ground crew, the boarding pass still showed the original time and the ground staff said nothing. We then pressed the ground staff for more answers, after which they finally replied, "oh yeah, its delayed. Yup. Their complete indifference, in addition to failure to update the passengers, led to many of the customers in line losing their patience with the staff. We did not receive any updates on the estimated departure time until we were in the waiting area near the gate. On the flight itself, the seats were uncomfortable and the plane outdated. No inflight entertainment, as expected. The only thing that made all this acceptable was the very cheap price of the tickets.

### "I will take my own food"
Toronto to Birmingham. Staff very good. Food disgusting. I was glad I'd brought my own food as this was my return flight, and the outward flight was also bad. The only good thing about the food was a piece of cake. The beef roll I was given was hot but really awful so I left it. Choice of films English/French even though clicking on English, most played French not English. If I fly with them again I will take my own food.

### "very pleasant and entertaining"
London Gatwick  to Toronto. We read many mixed reviews of Air Transat and most of them were not positive. We were very worried about using this airline, but to our surprise we found our journey very pleasant and entertaining. Staff was extremely cooperative. Touch screen entertaining system was much better and efficient than many airlines. They provide you hot and cold sandwiches as a simple option but tasty. We personally found this simple food option better healthier specially when you fly and you feel light and healthy during your entire flight. Aircraft was new and very clean. Seats were not cramped - myself and my son who was travelling with us both are tall persons and found no discomfort during the entire flight. We will definitely use this airline in future if we need to.

### "would advise take food with you"
I had return flight Paris-Montreal-Paris. The ground staff was excellent for both flights. The crew was excellent especially on route Paris - Montreal. I can say that they are very friendly, competent and attentive. The both flight were on time. The negative sides are narrow seats and horrible meal service. The seats are so narrow that you cannot move fingers. About the meal service the web-site says “Euro Bistro lets you choose from a variety of six hot or cold main courses. Your delicious meal also comes with a 5 oz. glass of wine”. This is very misleading statement as the meal service includes only one tasteless sandwich as the main course for 7-8 hours flights. This is not acceptable and the airline should allow passengers to pre-order normal hot meal as other low cost carriers doing (eg. Norwegian shuttle, Air Baltic, Fly Dubai, Pegasus etc). In current circumstances, I would advise take food with you if you fly Air Transat because what they provide is not eatable.

### "not travel with them again"
Manchester to Calgary. Ever since our family moved to Canada over 12 years ago, we have used Canadian Affair on a regular basis to either visit them or vice versa, we have noticed a sharp decline in service from when they stopped using Thomas Cook and started using Air Transat, this time we flew out at the end of June, came back with our grandchildren, my wife has taken them back and returns tomorrow, we were shocked at how bad it has become, the cabin staff were uninterested and more interested in talking among themselves, the food was shocking, for such a long flight a hot roll for the main meal which was virtually inedible, and a small slice of pizza before landing, being at the back of the plane they had run out of the selection we wanted. There was no crew coming around on a regular basis with water. Air Transat have let Canadian Affair down, we will not travel with them again.

### "cabin crew were on the whole not pleasant"
I was told by Canadian Affair (agent) that there was no Club Class on the flights from Glasgow to Vancouver. 3 adults flying and I paid over £3000 in fares (I took out Option Plus), I said we needed Emergency exit seats because 2 of the party were very tall. I also said I did not want seats by the toilets. We ended up in middle row with wall partition. 1 in front and right beside toilets. A 9 hour flight and no meal. A heated roll and before touchdown a slice of soggy pizza. Could hardly fit in seats they were so narrow. There was in fact Club Class on both journeys. Breakfast on return flight was a slice of banana bread. The cabin crew were on the whole not pleasant. Problem is that this company has the monopoly for charter flights direct from Glasgow to Vancouver. In addition it took them about 4 attempts to get the e-tickets correct. they just couldn't comprehend that my husband and son had similar names (difference was that my son had a middle name) and I had to continually point this out to them.

### "will never fly with Air Transat again"
Will never fly with Air Transat again. 5.5 hour delay. Took off and had to return to Gatwick. Whilst on tarmac was not allowed off plane, neither were passengers served any drinks or food whatsoever. Could not use toilets - filthy. Cabin crew rude and ignorant. Delay caused us to miss shuttle to final destination and had to get relatives to drive 2 hours to London to pick us up. Final insult was offered $100 off next flight. Compensation paid for delay but still fighting for compensation for sequence of events.

### "what they provide is pathetic"
Manchester to Vancouver return. Take food with you if you fly Air Transat because what they provide is pathetic. Calling it complimentary (ie. free), is just a cop out. On the 9 hours outward flight from Manchester to Vancouver (delayed nearly 4 hours) we were given a sandwich and a few small biscuits, and then later a slice of pizza. No compensation offered for the delay. On the return overnight flight we were given the sandwich again for dinner and a slice of cake for breakfast. For some reason on the return flight the plane was changed to a different model, so our £100 extra legroom exit door seats were up against a bulkhead. It remains to be seen if we get our money refunded.

### "refused both efforts to gouge me"
Montreal to Budapest via Toronto. Avoid Air Transat at all cost! Departure was on time but that was the last time. Arrival in Toronto was late 1.5 hrs. But I did not miss the connection because the next plane was delayed over 4 hours! The seats are tight; the toilet is ridiculously small and not tidied up on the 10 hr flight. Food was minimal. The airline was charging for both a headset ($9) and a blanket ($12). I refused both efforts to gouge me. The plane was hot. One could not walk around because areas were cordoned off.

### "amazing from start to finish"
Amsterdam to Vancouver with Air Transat. We had an amazing flight from start to finish. We have flown several times before with Air Transat, but this was our first time in Club Class and very enjoyable. Lots of leg room and wide seats. The extra perks were really nice - priority check in, priority baggage, great service, lots of food and drink, extra snacks. Loved the special coffees and warm cookies. Wonderful staff - very attentive, kind and caring. We will definitely fly with Air Transat and Club Class again.

### "our worst experience ever"
We have flown Air Transat for 10 years and we have generally have always been happy, however, this year has been our worst experience ever. Our flights were not cheap, we paid £2499.22 for two return flights (Manchester to Vancouver) and car hire and we expected much better than we got. Both our outbound and inbound flights were delayed, 5.5 hours and 6 hours. The outbound sector picked up a delay a week before our departure (3 hours at Manchester), it picked up further delays on each sector it completed thereafter. The airline could have delayed passengers at home, but did not. The inbound flight was delayed because it was waiting for a part to be delivered from another airport. YVR is an unmanned hub, namely it has no directly employed Air Transat employees at YVR only handling agents. It's maintence base at YVR didn't have the essential part, thus the aircraft was grounded until the essential part could be sourced, delivered and fitted. The point here, is that Air Transat operations would have know the length or likely length of the delay but mislead passengers by continually changing the delay. Vouchers for refreshments were give out but some of the food outlets had closed. Moreover, passengers who smoke (not me) were understandably frustrated at being trapped in a nonsmoking envrioment. The airline has recently changed its meal service, however, referring to it as a meal service is misleading. A hot (soggy, tasteless and burnt) sandwich (there is a choice of 6, we travelled with family who were on a separate booking, thus we all tried different sandwiches and were in agreement they were soggy, tasteless and burnt) napkin and bitter coffee or weak tea service in a polystyrene cup doesn't by an stretch of the imagination qualify for a meal or service in any language.The sandwiches were so unpopular, the crew completed a second service to get rid of them. I emailed my complaint down route but received no response. The same service was offered upon the return. When I returned I complained, and advised the airline that this change in service was purely a cost saving excercise and that the snack service was not acceptable for the duration of the flight. The airline advised me it was not a cost saving exercise and in any event it was complimentary. We paid a lot of money for our seats, they were not cheap, they were the most expensive we had ever paid. This season Air Transat has been bogged down with lengthly delays throughout its sectors (LGW, MAN, GLS, AMS, YVR, YYC, YUL) and the changes in its inflight service, crewing and flight planning, presumable to make efficiency saving, are costing it both financially and in its reputation. As a result of our experience and we have been regular flyers with Air Tranat, we are looking at other options for our annual holiday.

### "the worst we have experienced"
We flew from Glasgow to Montreal and our return flight was Toronto to Glasgow. We have flown with Air Transat 6 times over several years. This time was the worst we have experienced. Our flight was delayed for half an hour while we sat on the runway and we were offered no explanation. Ground staff at Toronto Airport were so rude, she didn't say one word to us and pointed to where she wanted us to go. On the aircraft the food was unacceptable and inedible, a sandwich and a few hours later a slice of pizza bread, if you are seated at the rear of the plane you will be offered what is left as on both flights they start with the front of the plane, this was the first time we have not had a meal. On our outbound journey one of the toilets was out of order which is unacceptable.

### "attendants very polite and helpful"
I have flown twice now with Air Transat, the first time I was pleased with the service I received, this time I was not very happy with the food to and from Toronto from Manchester. The sandwiches were not edible, you only had 3 choices, as this is a 6 hr flight a hot meal would have been better. Everything else with the service was good, the attendants were very polite and helpful.

### "could provide a small meal"
We have flown Air Transat before, we like them because they fly to Manchester from Toronto and are reasonably priced. It has always been a bit cramped but acceptable. This time the experience was not so good. We were in row 6.D and F. The person in front of my wife put his seat right back and at times when we were instructed to bring our seats up this person ignored the instruction.The flight attendants passed by but didn't notice until I pointed it out to them, even coming in to land. Otherwise the flight attendants were fine. I had the second worst sandwich in my life from Manchester to Toronto and the worst sandwich in my life from Toronto to Manchester. The drinks were fine but surely for a 6-7 hour fight they could provide a small meal. I notice that the flight attendants had a meal, but I am sure it wouldn't be too much more trouble or expense to provide the same for the passengers. I will probably fly Transat again, but if there is only a small difference in the price from Air Canada, I will probably go with them even if they do not fly directly to Manchester.

### "really nothing special"
I upgraded at the airport from Option Plus to CLub Class for $375 which seemed like a bargain. However you do get what you pay for. First the flight was punctual. The priority check-in, security and boarding were flawless and In Amsterdam my suitcase came thrid. These were all still perks also included in the Option Plus. The groundstaff at YVR were partially nice but a few of them that I had to deal with becuase of paying were highly unfriendly and unmotivated. Before boarding there is no lounge access with Club Class. The Club Class cabin consists of 12 extra wide seats with a bit more legroom that recline a little more than normal seats. Asides from the extra width, they are similar to premium economy seats of other companies. Before take off we were served some cava while after take off there was a bar service with a few crackers. The meals are pre-ordered normal meals served on china. There was a hot meal, a salad, some cheese and a dessert. Really nothing special. I would say a standard meal from a more respectable company like Air France / KLM or Lufthansa. The drinks were plenty but then again nothing special. When it came to sleeping we had a tiny fleecy blanket and an inflatable pillow. There was a little service pack with toohbrush, handcream, socks, slippers etc.. During the night they came by with chips and chocolate bars. The breakfast consisted of some fruit and a hot mini cinnamonbun. Which left me rather hungry after this nine hour flight. In short, standard service in extra wide premium economy seats. Advice, get the Option Plus for some extra service and extra baggage. Or fly with Condors buisness class to get high quality service from a low-budget company.

### "food awful - tasteless and unpleasant"
London Gatwick to Toronto with Air Transat. Not a good experience, not advised the airline does not provide earphones / small blanket for transatlantic flights, which in our estimation is essential. I understand this is a 'budget' airline but maybe this is something customers should be made aware of before flying - when you arrive on the aircraft and are told it is a little late. They can be purchased on board but at an enhanced cost - we would have taken these if we had known in advance. Food is pretty awful - tasteless and unpleasant. Flight attendants not very professional - return flight today all 4 attendants were talking between themselves until a few minutes before the aircraft landed. Several people were still standing / putting things away etc, when the seat belts sign had been on for several minutes - the attendants did not even notice. I would not fly with this airline again.

### "cannot fault any part of the service"
Manchester to Toronto with Air Transat. Cannot fault any part of the service provided. No hesitation in recommending. Pleasant cabin crew, comfortable seating. Food more than adequate, sufficient fluids provided. Plenty of entertainment choices onboard. Return flight delayed but not through fault of airline.

### "staff were fantastic"
I decided to opt for option plus for four adult tickets. Yes the seats are terribly close and not in the least comfortable. However the staff were fantastic. After reading reviews I wasn't particularly looking forward to the flights. Would definitely fly with Air Transat again from Gatwick to Halifax. The extra for options plus was worth it for the extra luggage etc. Both the outbound and inbound flights were on time and no problems at all.

### "Club class this is not"
Flew Vancouver to Glasgow via Toronto with Air Transat. Club class this is not. Booked return flight in Club but on return journey from Vancouver to Toronto there was no Club section or individual entertainment. The seats were standard seats therefore when the passenger in row 1 put her seat back I was cramped. There was 1 screen for all to watch a movie, I felt I had gone back in time some 20 years. Obviously I raised this matter with the crew at the time and complained to the 'airline' upon my return but their response was that Internal flights do not have Club they just use economy seats, using 2 of the 3 seats available, for more comfort. This is totally out of order and should have been mentioned on their website as they are selling seats at premium prices, advertised as Club, which are not. How they have got away with it I do not know. This is the first time I have used this airline and rest assured it will be the last. I thought as the flight was direct from Glasgow it would save me going via London. I shall stick with BA, more of an airline and less of a budget airline with old fleet.

### "lack of service"
I would recommend not to use this airlines due to the lack of service and communication with the passengers. I had a problem with the entertainment system and when requested to try and sort the problem the air hostess was not interested in helping and just left me to it. We were meant to leave Gatwick at 12pm. It's now 13.30 and no movement or information. I am reviewing Air Transat and will report my findings further when I get back to the UK.

### "seats were hard and uncomfortable"
I have just returned from a holiday in Canada and flew Air Transat as part of a package. We flew out Gatwick to Calgary and returned to Gatwick from Vancouver. There was no inflight entertainment, unless you purchased their earphones. Though there was a good amount of legroom, the seats were hard and uncomfortable, hardly any upholstery and a plastic feeling. I could hardly walk off at Gatwick. The food was disgusting. Going we were at the back and had the choice of take the scraps or have nothing, I should have chosen nothing, but I had the chicken wrap (only thing left). It was a cold, soggy mush. Coming home I had the pulled beef and onion roll. This consisted of pulled beef with onion on a ciabatta roll with some sort of plastic cheese, this was wrapped in cellophane and heated into a soggy mass. If you have the choice, we didn't, use another airline.

### "could not be faulted"
Flew from Gatwick on 5th June flight TS677, took option plus which costs a little more but well worth it, priority check, no queue, extras on board (very welcome). Priority baggage handing (bags quickly off at Vancouver), selected seats were available and clearly marked as option plus, no problem getting the extras we paid for. Flight left 35 minutes late but this time was almost made up inflight arriving just 5 minutes late. Check in staff and flight crew were excellent, food and drinks inflight were good, no full meal but prefer the simpler offering. No complaints about flight just a bit cramped but same on all cheaper airlines and on most carriers in economy. Return flight was on 25th June, TS676 from Vancouver, again priority check-in in worked well, only negative 1 hour 40 minute delay due to staff allocation and shifts (been a major problem earlier in the week and still having problems getting everything back to normal). No problem for us, some time made up in flight and they insured people catching connecting flights disembarked from plane first at Gatwick. Crew again excellent and could not be faulted in any way. Priority baggage handing again worked well, bags one of the first on conveyor. Aircraft cabin well prepared for both flights with good seat back screens and a decent selection of films etc. Must say have no major negative comments about Air Transat just could do with a bit more room and softer seats but as said earlier no different to economy on other airlines I have flown. Online booking was easy and you can now view booking on-line for confirmation of flight etc. Return tickets with extras were £600 each, excellent value and compared well with other airlines.

### "a very favorable experience"
The Air Transat flight from Prague to Montreal was a very nice surprise! The A330 looked brand new and was comfortable with enough leg space and sufficient incline angle. Seats were equiped with interactive screens. The toilet was clean. The FA were professional and helpful. We were served drinks several times during the 8 hour flight and the bistro menu was not bad at all giving the choice of about 6 different options. The vegetarian sushi was nice. We got a slice of good pizza shortly before our landing in YUL. Arrived to YUL 25 minutes before scheduled time. Great value for a one way ticket. Overall a very favorable experience. Would not hesitate to fly with them again.

### "you get what you pay for"
Flew Vancouver to London with Air Transat. I guess you get what you pay for. On a positive note, the fare for this trip was very reasonable compared to the other carriers. Unfortunately, we had one bad customer service experience after another. Getting through to the call center can be quite time consuming and then we were often left on hold for ages. It would be nice if you could deal with things online, but their website is poorly designed and many routine things require an actual phone call. For some reason the online reservation system is different from the seat assignment system. After you book, you're supposed to sign up before the flight for your meals (how bizarre), but they were out of our first and second choices on both flights anyhow. The kicker was a 12 hour schedule change to an earlier time for the return flight while we were traveling. This meant that we had to change our connecting flight to London and shorten out trip at our expense. Their suggestion was that we get a refund for the return flight and try to find something else. Suffice to say, we were disappointed. We don't need to be treated like royalty, but we do feel like we should be treated like valued customers.

### "go prepared with something nutritious"
I have flown with Air Transat a number of times, I was very disappointed this time with the catering. The Euro Bistro menu is totally inadequate for a long haul flight. Lunch there, choice of a sandwich or wrap or veg sushi followed by a slice of pizza as a snack. Ditto on the return trip with a slice of plain stodgy cake for a snack. There was no fruit and very little veg. Lots of stodge though. Suggest passengers go prepared with something nutritious. If I was cabin staff I'd be embarrassed to serve this and call it a meal. Spoilt what was otherwisre a good flight from London Gatwick to Vancouver with friendly helpful staff.

### "a totally inadequate response"
Manchester to Calgary with Air Transat. Flight was supposed to leave at 12.00pm, boarding was delayed 1 hour and once on the plane it was clear there was a problem. The flight crew's body language and attitude indicated there was something major going on. The captain spoke over the intercom ensuring us that everything was been done to remedy problem and at 30 minute intervals repeated himself. After 2 hours it was clear we were going nowhere and by their own operating rules we should have been allowed to get off after 1.30 hours. Water was passed around but it was now obvious they were trying to find accomodation for us. After 3 hours we disembarked and picked up our luggage. I decided to go home and return as instructed for an 11.00am flight and to be there for 6.30am check in. The airport was chaos and the airport staff were struggling to cope with our flight and 2 other long haul flights in the same hall. We eventually left at 12.00 the next day. We were offered $250 dollars compensation against another flight with them which was a totally unprofessional and inadequate response to cover the inconvenience experienced.

### "deterioration of service"
Montreal to Marseille with Air Transat. The aircraft aisle is about 2/3 the width of a normal aisle and constantly getting touched by people walking by. The seat width is tight but legroom room is decent. Food quality is lousy. Inflight entertainment is from a shared screen and no choice of movies. I have flown previously with Air Transat and have noticed a deterioration of services provided.

### "very stressful"
Flying from Manchester to Calgary to see family so was very excited but the beginning of the holiday was very stressful due to numerous events relating to the flight. Due to depart at 12 but still hadn't boarded by then. When all seated and ready to go we were told there was a problem and we would be updated every 15 mins but after 4 hours we were told that the problem would not be sorted until the next day so we were put up in a hotel for the night. We finally took off 24 hours later. On our return journey on the 22 May all went well except for the very unprofessional manner of on of the cabin crew who after giving us black tea and coffee told us she wasn't a mind reader and if we had wanted milk we should have asked for it. I would have thought that this would have been common courtesy and also a very important part of a public related job. Would rather pay a higher price than use this airline again.

### "a favourable experience"
Flew London Gatwick to Vancouver. I expected quite a few flaws, given the low price of the flight, but was pleasantly surprised. The cabin crew were very friendly and helpful. The food selection was better than expected. There was a surplus of meals at the end, so the cabin crew handed those out to anyone else who was still hungry. Decent selection of movies (around 50). Cons: Earphones are usually complimentary, at least on the other transatlantic flight I've been on, but Air Transat were charging $8 for a pair, in case you'd forgotten to bring your own. The seats weren't very comfortable, which left me moving around in my seat a lot. The leg room was fine. I'm 6'2" and had quite a bit of room between my knees and the seat in front. Overall, a favourable experience. This is usually by far the cheapest flight from London to Vancouver. I flew the same journey with Air Canada last year for £300 more, and whilst Air Canada's seat comfort is probably better, Air Transat's food selection and portion size was definitely better.

### "don't know how to rate"
I don't know how to rate Air Transat. I was due to fly from Manchester to Calgary on Sunday 8th May but due to technical problems we were over 24 hours late. Like everyone I wish to fly on a safe plane rather than one with problems. The fact was we were on board a boiling hot plane for 5 hours, without food or drink, (a cold drink was provided if you asked) not good in that heat. While on board very few announcements were made as to what was happening. Five hours after we were suppose to take off we disembarked, and told that we were going to a hotel overnight. While I appreciate this takes some time again no announcements made as to what was happening. Taken into a hotel in the middle of Manchester the only food provided soup and sandwiches. The following morning picked up for a 10.30 departure which left as 12. Voucher for breakfast provided. The new menu onboard is diabolical. Warm sandwiches (for 9 hour flight ) all of which have cheese. We were offered a price reduction on our next flight. I was aware the if flight leaving Europe is that late the compensation of 600.euro is due. I wrote to claim this and received a call to say this would be forthcoming.

### "no explanation in our queue"
Flew Air Transat from Glasgow to Vancouver via Calgary. The only good thing about this airline was that it got us from A to B. Getting on the flight to start was a shambles, seats were being allocated to passengers despite those seats being pre-booked, so a very long delay, with no explanation in our queue. No food for a gluten free diet even though this had been pre-ordered and booked, explaination menu change. So a 9 hour flight with a few biscuits that I had taken with me. Fore warned would have been a good idea. The food on the whole was atrocious, most people were throwing it away. Their so called continental breakfast consisted of a slice of banana cake. They were more concerned about coming round and selling duty free goods. Many people on the aircraft were complaining, one young mother travelling on her own with two young children were all split up as seats were not paid and pre-booked. One airline we will definitely not be flying with again.

### "flight had to be rescheduled"
My daughters Air Transat flight on May 27th from Toronto Pearson to London was a disaster from the beginning. The flight was delayed for 1 hour but no reason as to why was given to passengers. They were all boarded after the 1 hour delay and then had to de-plane because the air conditioning was broken. After another 2 hour delay, the captain announced the flight was canceled. The original flight was scheduled to depart at 10pm. The flight had to be rescheduled for today, 5/28 at 1pm. Thankfully my daughter was able to take a cab to her apartment but there were many passengers that had to sleep in the airport. Due to the time difference, the plane was scheduled to land in London at 1am. The trains do not run this late so the passengers all had to make hotel bookings. My daughter text me and said the only thing each passenger received for the nightmare was $200. She has lost a day of her trip and hours of sleep.

### "the crew were excellent"
Air Transat flight from Paris to Montreal. I have mixed feelings about this airline. The ground staff and the crew were excellent (very supportive and the stewardesses did great job during the flight). However, the seats are tight and there is no any legroom. The bistro menu is a bit of a joke. One cold sandwich for 8 hours flight - this is not acceptable. I do not understand why the company is not willing to sell the hot food (usual airline meal). If the Air Transat sells blanket, pillow, headsets etc., I would advise to add airline hot meal tray for purchase as well.

### "seat very uncomfortable"
Toronto to London Gatwick with Air Transat. Check-in was fantastic. No line ups. Flight was delayed but when boarded there was another delay of 2.5 hours due to catering. So why were we boarded? Seat was very uncomfortable and seat pitch was awful. Pleasant staff. Bistro meal and banana bread breakfast was terrible. Inflight entertainment was average. I would not travel with this company again.

### "no more Air Transat for our family"
We were flying from Toronto to Cayo Coco, Cuba on April 14. Our plane was supposed to leave at 6:25 am. but was delayed because of catering. They didn't board us until 7am and then made us wait onboard for that catering for another 3 hours. We departed from Toronto at 10am when we actually were supposed to be landing in Cayo Coco. No water was offered while we were waiting for catering. Kids were crying, a lot of people got stiff and claustrophobic. But it didn't matter much to Air Transat! During the flight another surprise, it turned out that we wouldn't be getting any sandwich or water for free. Air Transat after 3.5 hours of our vacation time stolen still wanted to make money on us. A little bottle of water cost $3, a sandwich or little pizza - $7.75 etc. We were really disappointed. When we came back from our vacation we filed a complaint with Air Transat, but received an answer that nothing irregular had happened and Air Transat didn't owe us anything. So no more Air Transat for our family.

### "not impressed with the Bistro menu"
Toronto to Glasgow with Air Transat. Not impressed with the Euro Bistro menu. I ordered the hot grilled vegetable sandwich which was stone cold and the vegetables were mushy could not eat it. The lady next to me ordered the hot brie and ham sandwich which was also cold. It was very disappointing. Also the breakfast snack was some kind of banana bread. The package was wet and the bread was soggy. Please consider using some other caterer - this one is atrocious.

### "don't seem to respect their customers"
Our family is disappointed that due to a "Catering mishap" our flight to Cayo Coco from Toronto was delayed 3.5 hours. The entire plane was boarded, only to be told that Air Transat would not authorize taking off until the catered food was loaded (even thought the flight to Cuba takes about 3 hours). Apparently the caterer had made a mistake and we all had to waste valuable hours of our family vacations waiting around. To top it all off, the airline charged us for the bistro food. I thought they would have at least had the courtesy of providing us with free food. I don't think we would book Air Transat again. They don't seem to respect their customers time.

### "no respect for customers"
Cancun to Edmonton. Absolutely the last time! What was originally sold as a direct Air Transat flight was changed to a stop in Calgary to let off passengers. Do not have a problem with that, but someone in the company decided to take all Edmonton bound passengers off the plane and put us on a different plane at midnight! Surprise to the flight crew and ground crew as no one was prepared. Huge delay and the total lack of concern from customer relations is a big red flag. No respect for their customers.

### "staff was very friendly"
My Air Transat flight from Amsterdam to Toronto was on an airplane with no individual tv's, but only aisle tv's every so may rows which was a little disappointment. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I was surprised at how often we got something to drink. Twice a soda and twice coffee/tea and of course a drink along with the dinner. I am a vegetarian so I did put a special meal request prior to my trip. I wasn't disappointed at what I got. On my trip back I did have my own tv which was really nice. Good choice of movies/ shows to kill the time.

### "the crew were wonderful"
Haultuco to Toronto. The airplane was clean, well stocked and the crew were wonderful. Our biggest complaint is how cold the cabin became an hour after take off. It was so cold that people were complaining. I had an Air transat blanket previously bought on another flight we took from Portugal last year. This along with 3 sweaters and a hoody, and wool socks were not enough. The flight attendant was rubbing and blowing into her hands to stay warm at the back of the airplane. About two hours after take off, I found the cabin to be a bit more comfortable, not blowing cold air on your face, (it was not the vents above us blowing the air). It was still cold, but not freezing. This is the third time this has happened going on an Air Transat charter. It was cold going to Mexico this last time, but not as freezing as our previous trip down to Mexico last year and coming back this year. We enjoy the service and the flight, but unless something is done about the cabin temperature, we will no longer be taking Air Transat anymore.

### Air Transat customer review
Manchester to Toronto return. Booking email (through edreams) said online check in to print boarding passes would be within 24hrs but rang to confirm this, and was told we had to check in at the airport. Also emailed edreams few days earlier and Air Transat  direct to ask baggage allowance to clarify one small carry on case up to 10kg plus purse, camera bag or laptop case allowed. Edreams only quoted the same sentence, but Air Transat replied personally and confirmed a handbag (or in the case of my child her rucksack) was fine to carry onboard. Large blue seating (3x3x3)with good leg room, middle arm rests do go up and down. Reasonable recline too. Left late due to technical problem-a fault which controlled hot water pump, they didn't manage to fix it so only hand gel in toilets for hand washing and no hot water for teaor coffee for 8hr flight! 11 overhead IFE screens to be shared between all passengers. First hour or so maps showing distance travelled, route, timings etc then 3 films. Only card payments on board - no cash, no debit card. All duty free in Canadian Dollars (still not cash tho). They offered comfort packs (headphones, pillow, blanket, eye shield $9) headphones without pack $8. Children given travel pack with an activity note book in, crayon pen, cards, headphones, reusable sticker sheet-space theme and blow up ball! Visa cards for entry to Canada, complimentary water, pop or juice (option to buy wine or champagne). Lunch tray 2hrs after takeoff. Received complimentary glass of wine. Return flight leaving Canada 9pm landing UK 9am. Pearson airport: Duty free a bit spread out but found usual stuff near our gate 31. What you buy gets kept then delivered to your gate just before boarding. Option to load unused change to PayPal or ITunes on a machine at airport but don't know if minimum upload etc. Gate lounge had online iPads to use with pay machines for food orders from the cafe in situ. Flight boarded on time and no one questioned my baggage. I had two pull on cases within 10kg allowance plus a rucksack and handbag, coats and duty free!

### "customer service oriented"
Toronto to Punta Cana with Air Transat. A 4hr flight and they were extremely customer service oriented. Taking off and landing on time, the service on the plane was fantastic. Return flight was exceptional. The attendants even recommended that we take other empty seats to be more comfortable - we were 4 (2 parents and 2 five year olds). They gave our boys a kiddie loot bag that had headphones that the boys could use for the inflight entertainment. Thank you for a great flight/service.

### "never again"
Flew Air Transat from Toronto to Santa Clara - never again. Paid for Option plus, comes with perks such as priority check-in line, priority boarding etc.. those services weren't available to us. They changed the seats that we paid extra for, for 12 passengers, now everyone is spread all over the plane including small kids under 6 assigned to sit with strangers etc.. Typical response from customer relations "sorry, we reserve the rights, see terms and conditions etc.. But option plus is an additional service I purchased. Now it's Westjet or Air Canada (not Rouge) that I will only fly with. Going to Europe even with a stopover when I can I will fly Icelandair.

### "truly a budget airline"
As we had a not so good experience on a previous Air Transat flight from Vancouver to Punta Cana, we reluctantly booked another flight on March 1, 2016 to Cancun from Vancouver (Flights TS3342 and TS3343). We always request the extra leg room as my husband is 6’5. Our agent assured us that the seats we had not only going down but returning were the extra leg room and went as far as to call Air Transat to ensure it, as our son who is the same height had an earlier issue with a changed plane and the seats being wrong. The moment we had our Priority boarding called and we entered the plane we knew we were in trouble. Not only did we not have extra leg room, but our seats did not recline to even give a little bit of extra space. We were livid and asked to be moved immediately. Our return flight was the same scenario. Even after the travel agent called Air Transat again to confirm extra leg room we were not only in regular seats but we were behind the extra leg room / emergency exit seats. We spoke to the 2 ladies in those seats and were told they didn’t pay for reserve those seats. What a slap in the face for us since we not only reserved but paid extra for our seats. Both flights were on Enerjet planes which are subcontracted by Air Transat. The planes have no entertainment whatsoever and are truly a budget airline. When you book through Air Transat you assume you are flying with their planes, their amenities and their reputation. Not a chance. We paid for Priority service and our baggage was first off the plane in Cancun so kudos to the ground crew.

### "as smooth as it can get"
Moncton to Varadero. This was our first experience with Air Transat and I can say it was as smooth as it can get for us, last time on an other airline we were delayed 7 hours on a sunny day. So this was a cut and dry vacation for my wife and I. Thank you very much Air Transat, you will be top of the list for my next travel plans.

### "found to be very unorganized"
On our latest flight on Air Transat they couldn't take off due to the plane being overweight. The airline was unorganized and not ready to accommodate everybody and everything. Finally they decided that the best thing to do was unload luggage from the plane. They made no effort to compensate for the inconvenience and no apologies were made. All we were told to do was see an agent on the ground once we arrived. When we got there the agents were rude and made everyone feel like what was happening was their fault but in reality it was the airlines fault. I found the overall flight to be ok but I found the way they dealt with the situation to be very unorganized.

### "handled this matter very poorly"
Toronto to Prague in October 2015, and for about €37 (one way) you can add 10kg luggage allowance and get a few nice perks on board like seat selection, a welcome drink and care kit. Unfortunately only 2 of my 3 check in pieces of luggage arrived at Prague Airport. I waited at the desk for more than 30 minutes but it was unmanned. I could not wait forever so I had to leave  in the hopes that the missing piece would be found and forwarded to me. Do not ever leave an airport if you have not first received the luggage irregularity form from the airline in the event of missing or damaged luggage as they cannot assist you otherwise. Communication went back and forth for a month between myself and Air Transat. At the end the search for my luggage was terminated with no result and because I did not have the form, they could not assist. My travel insurance could not help me because I had not completed a baggage irregularity form. Air Transat handled this matter very poorly.

### "seating was tremendously tight"
Check-in was fast for Air Transat flight from Montréal to Cancun. Boarding was on time but a bit disorganized. Seating was tremendously tight on a 3x3x3 configuration. The flight was packed so you really felt other travelers really close. Entertainment options were really good, with a variety of movies, TV shows and music. Service was friendly and flight attendants were courteous and attentive. Food was a bit overpriced and junky. This flight tends to be more expensive than Air Canada, I would not pay more together same service on a more uncomfortable plane.

### "flight was calm"
Air Transat flight from Cancun to Montréal. Same plane as inbound: tight and uncomfortable. Ground agents were not friendly at all. Service from most of the cabin crew members was very attentive and nice, but the purser looked and acted bitter. Cancun airport is terribly hot and expensive. Boarding was done in order, but the terminal could not accommodate all the passengers getting in line. Food onboard was for sale, and flight was calm. Landing was on time. No complaints, but definitely not the best option.

### "staff were polite"
Booked with Air Transat to fly from London Gatwick to Vancouver and it was one of the easiest and most comfortable flights that I've had. The staff were polite and always there to help and the food was nice. I would recommend, Air Transat got me to Vancouver at an affordable price.

### "paying for what you get"
Calgary to Montego Bay with Air Transat. One has to realize and accept you are paying for what you get. Unfortunately flight attendants are often not very polite and may take their personal issues to work, but tend not to engage too much as need to get from point A to B safely. Travelling internationally three or four times a year is great savings with Air Transat and always purchase Option Plus. Have your snack packed prior to boarding, and settle down with your own headphones or a good book and hopefully catch some sleep.

### "cabin crew very agreeable"
I have flown with Air Transat for a few years now since they became the partner with Canadian Affair. I have never found any cause of dissatisfaction. The flights have generally been on time, cabin crew very agreeable and attentive and the cabin clean and tidy on boarding. I did once have a dodgy USB port caused by some clown trying to force the wrong plug into it - hardly AT's fault! In that case the cabin attendant moved me to different seat where USB was OK.

### "took our money and ran"
Booked with Air Transat from Edmonton to Cuba. No Air Transat planes available therefore given Enerjet as replacement but told it would be staffed by Air Transat. This was not the case, nothing negative about Enerjet staff but I expect to get what I paid for by having transat employees since I'm a nervous flyer and never heard of this airline before. Plane cramped, no leg room, seats hard, no tv or plug ins for your own electronics. No ice to have a cold beverage. We had originally booked club class with Air Transat but this isn't and option with Enerjet, so much for comfort and enjoyable trip. Only reply Air Transat had to this change is "we have the right to change carriers" that being said we were assured it would be operated by transat. They took our money and ran. Never again will I use them, other airlines available.

### "poor customer service"
Poor customer service from Air Transat flying from Mexico to Montreal. My family and I almost felt tension between the staff members as if they did not get along. Lack of communication. One flight attendant passing water and others going the opposite way asking if we wanted drinks and thought we were only getting water at first so that was a little confusing. Dissapointed not to be getting snacks for sure. Should have informed myself of this before. The seats are very uncomfortable. However, the movie/tv show option are excellent. Take advantage of this and bring your headphones.

### "no free snacks"
Calgary to Montego Bay. First time flying with Air Transat, and very disappointed in the service, no free snacks with 6 hours direct flight. Return flight delayed 1.5 hours late, again no snacks for 7 hour flight. The seats are so cramp that when person in front of you recline it feels like they are on your lap! We have travelled with Air Canada vacation and Westjet vacation both are much better airline to travel.

### "no extra legroom"
My husband and I travelled to St. Martin on Air Transat. I took advantage of the seat selection process and paid a premium of $50.00 per seat on both outgoing and incoming routes. When I chose the seats, the aircraft configuration indicated we were flying on a wide body jet and we were in the emergency exit aisle with lots of leg room. When we boarded the plane we found we were on a 737 with no extra legroom in our $50.00 premium seats. In short, we have paid $200.00 for the exact same seats everyone else had (feeling pretty stupid now). I have just begun the tedious, time consuming process of trying to get a refund. Nobody at Air Transat will speak to me about this in person and I have to go the email route.

### "next time I will avoid"
London Ontario to Punta Cana return with Air Transat. We had about a 45 minute delay on take off, which is understandable considering the weather. This was one of the least turbulent flights that I have been on, yet the pilot had the seat belt sign on for 3/4 of the 4hr flight. Every time the seatbelt light turned off briefly, there was a scramble to line up for the washroom. There were so many people lined up the stewardesses had a hard time going down the aisle. After a while the people ignored the seatbelt sign, refusing to sit down, because they couldn't wait any longer. The seating is very cramped, especially when the person in front of you reclines her seat. This is the first 4 hour flight we have been on without a meal. Next time I will avoid flying Air Transat.

### "very tight leg room"
We have flown with several different airlines and  liked Air Transat better than the others, but are starting to rethink our choice. After a few trips we found out about the Options Plus package that could be purchased. the way it was described to us made it a reasonable choice. The first few trips with Options plus went smoothly, but the last two have not been as nice. We flew from Toronto to Punta Cana, DR. We do get to pre-book our seats to and from our destination, but still find the seats are very tight in leg room. In order to get seats with extra leg room we were told even with the Options plus package we would have to pay extra for those seats. When we first got the Options Plus we had a cash value limit for what we wanted to purchase from the food cart. The last two trips this changed so we were given no choice. We received a Tapas box that included food that my husband and I did not eat. If we wanted anything else we had to pay. We were not even given the option of the equivalent value of the Tapas box. Somehow the same food for breakfast, lunch or dinner does not make sense to me. I do realize there are a lot of people on a place that need to be satisfied, but if I am paying extra for extra services and am not receiving them then my money may be better spent elsewhere.

### "service was horrible"
I traveled from Vancouver to Glasgow with my ten year old son in Aug/15. I am not a person who gets nit picky about much but would never fly Air Transat again. To begin with what is said about the seats is true. I travel a lot and they had to be the worse I have encountered. No padding and the least amount of leg room. Four hours into the trip I was dreading the return trip already. The service was horrible but not because of the staff. There is too few of them. Putting on your light and waiting half an hour for any attention was considered the norm. We had a big spill and it took 42 minutes from the time I hit the light and we received help. Once the carts get in the aisle basically forget it. No service at all other than eventually a meal arriving. On the way there my son slept the whole time but on our return trip he was awake and apprehensive. He gets motion sickness easily so reading etc was not really a choice but they had those video terminals so I counted on that to help entertain him for the 9 hour flight. About an hour into the flight his terminal started experiencing problems and shut down. We traded seats so he could use mine but soon mine did the same thing as well as the one in the third seat. I hit the light for some help. 52 minutes later I finally flagged a stewardess going by. Her response was a big fake smile, a shrug "nothing I can do about that" she says and begins to leave. Wait a minute. Please come back here. I paid the same as everyone else and have a child with me. I was told we would have a terminal and have no other way of entertaining him because I counted on it. . I don't matter but I need one for my son". Her response was that there was "no guarantee" about the terminals. I can move seats if I want. I stand up and look around. I see single seats here and there. I need to sit with my son though. The closest ones were six rows apart. I could see three spots with duel empty seats but the person in those rows had spread out. I asked one to move. He refused. I then asked the same stewardess to help me find a row we could both sit in because they were out there. She turned to me and proclaimed loudly "I don't understand what you want from me". We finally found a seat thanks to a wonderful passenger going out of her way to help and we ended up in a centre row. My terminal quit after five minutes so don't count on them for entertainment. I was blown away at the lack of empathy shown over a mom wanting to sit with her young son. The icing on the cake was I paid an extra $240.00 to choose our seats when we booked just to make sure my son and I could be together and he could have a window seat. When I called after the trip I was told that payment made no guarantee either. I was offered $50 off my next trip. That was after I said I would never use them again.

### "hardly any legroom"
My Husband and I travelled with Air Transat from Kelowna to Puerto Vallarta. We were very disappointed with the airplane, service and cleanliness. The seats are very uncomfortable and there is hardly any legroom. The service was very poor, too. We were only twice offered a beverage. They did not offer any snacks either. Then to sum it up, the plane was not cleaned, the drop tables and seats were dirty. One of the stewardess was touching the inside of the cups she was filling up with her fingers and also collecting the garbage without gloves. In my pinion every plane should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected after every flight for the sake of the passengers.

### "how uncomfortable seats were"
Air Transat trip from Victoria BC to Cancun return, with flights operated by Enerjet. Two of us travelled outbound on Jan. 16 and were lucky enough to have pre-booked the exit row, therefore the flight was pleasant. Not so on the return flight, we were seated in row 7 and I cannot believe how little leg room and how uncomfortable the seats were. We were both miserable the whole 6 hours of the flight. There is no opportunity for a movie or any form of entertainment provided as well. Also, we purchased the chicken sandwich which was awful, and would not recommend buying anything on the flight. We travel south twice a year and will no longer use Air Transat if they continue to use Enerjet Boeing 737 planes.

### "not good value for money"
We booked our 2 week trip to Cuba from Regina in September 2015 to avoid late flights and to ensure direct flights. We normally only fly direct. Also paid the extra for the option plus. Two weeks before the trip our agent advised that we would be makinking one quick stop in Santa Maria but we would just stay on the plane. The crew never communicated anything during the stop other than to take all our belongings, including all carry ons and exit the plane. While escorted to the terminal we all had to go through security again and then sit and wait an hour. Again no one from the crew communicated anything to us while we waited. We had no idea what was going on. After we all reboarded the crew did not say anything. While at the resort Air Transat staff told us our flight back would be direct. Well not the case. We arrived at the airport to read on the board that our flight was leaving at 18.45, would you believe by 16.30 they were calling for all Regina passengers to board the plane. I quickly ran to find my husband to board. While boarding I could hear other passengers worried about missing their flight due to the earlier departure. After departing guess what? Touch down in Santa Maria, again no communication from the crew until we departed. Also why were our option plus seats in the middle of the plane? What happened to the leisure boarding and unboarding. We feel totally cheated by this so called perk. Definately not good value for money. We had to purchase our meal on way to and from Cuba on plane. We are very dissatisfied with the service and crew.

### "greeted by unhappy staff"
I will never fly with Air Transat again. Flew from Puerto Vallarta to Edmonton. Waited over 2 hours in line and rushed to board the plane only to be greeted by unhappy staff. The announcements could not be heard as they spoke so fast. The seats are cramped. The food was not good. A smile and an apology would have helped this flight survive but the reply was only it was not their fault. I felt I was bothering them by asking a question.

### "waited for a few passengers"
Our flights with Air Transat was Toronto to London, UK and return. Outgoing we were 3 hrs delayed because they waited for a few passengers from Montreal to board our flight, in turn for those waiting, it affected 100s of people and costly for the rest of us who missed our connections, flights, buses, trains etc when we arrived in London. This was an idiotic decision by Transat for a few late people. On our return to Toronto a week later we were 8 hrs delayed, mechanical I believe. However, the pilot and crew told us they couldn't work over their allotted time and diverted our flight to Montreal, so the Toronto passengers had to wait for a new pilot and crew. Instead of getting into Toronto at 3pm, we arrived 11pm. Again, passengers getting in so late, missing connections, flights, buses, trains etc when we arrived.

### "whole experience was negative"
My wife and I have traveled a lot and at least once a year we use Air Transat. We have noticed over the years a dramatic reduction in services provided by the airline and our last trip from Regina to Punta Cana ended early this morning. From the Air Transit staff in Punta Cana to the last comments by the attendants the whole experience was negative. From long lineups that lasted four hours to the constant delays at each stop and the unbelievably poor service by the in-flight attendants. The food was almost inedible and expensive if you could get someone to serve you. The staff were rude and at times acting as if we were an inconvienance to them.

### "again no compensation"
Never again with Air Transat. When we were leaving at 9am for Punta Cana from Toronto on Jan 11 2016 we had to wait 2 hours while they changed planes (some mechanical problem). We all boarded the replacement plane only to be told there was trouble with some instrumentation in the cockpit. This took 1 hour to resolve while we all sat there in the poor ventilated conditions. If we had flown on time we would have had 1/2 day at the beach that 1st day. Now we are 3 hours behind schedule - so we lost 1/2 day of our vacation. Not a word of apology from the staff. No mention of compensation for the 1/2 day lost. Not even a free glass of wine. On the way home on Jan 25 2016 the captain announced that the overhead entertainment screens did not work on the way down and they couldn't fix then in Punta Cana. Again no compensation. Not even a coffee until we were in the air for 2 hours. They were more interested in selling drinks and duty free goods which were presented quite promptly when we were in the air. That's 3 malfunctions of one sort or another in 2 flights. Very crowded tight quarters.

### "never ever again"
Regina to Punta Cana. This is twice that I have flown with Air Transat and all I can say is never ever again. I will duck up the extra couple hundred to fly Sunwing or Westjet. Seriously over 6 hours to get to our destination and over 8hrs back and we were offered something to drink twice. Keep in mind it's a half a glass and not even a bag of peanuts. The plane was an hour late going there and 4 hours coming back. The staff were rude therefore was uncomfortable asking for anything and when the person in front of me leaned back the tray was literally on my lap and I'm only 5 feet.

### "the aircraft is cramped"
Vancouver to Gatwick and the aircraft is cramped. When the seat in front reclines you are jammed into the seat with very little room to move. The food beggers belief, portions are fit for a 5 year old and the salad was frozen! They only serve 1 meal  and a slice of banana bread during the 9.5 hour flight. The price paid was extortionate for what we got. The entertainment could really do with an upgrade. In the middle of January they were still playing Christmas movies. Choice is very limited and in music there really is no choice. Very disappointed and won't waste my money on them again.

### "never again give them a chance"
Last year's trip was okay. Air Transat failed us by bumping us out of Club Class at the last second. This year's trip rom Edmonton to Cancun that was to take place 6 weeks from now has been a nightmare. We booked 6 months in advanced and four months later were told that they had booked us into the middle of a major construction zone. Then 24 hours after paying off the balance of out trip they inform us that they were cancelling our direct flights and sending us through Calgary. Then they let us know that we were being bumped out of Club Class seats again after they were paid for. Strike, one, two and three. Never again will I give them a chance to screw up our vacation.

### "Get new planes!"
We left on January 4th from Ottawa to Puerto Plata with Air Transat. Onboard computer problem. Delayed 1.5 hours leaving, onboard plane. Shortly after departure, pilot announces have to return to Ottawa. Turned around then turned around again. Pilot announces problem resolved. Continuing on trip. Return trip January 11th the flight delayed 3 hours. Mechanic flown in to repair problem with plane. Froze in airport prior to departure. Provided a $15.00 voucher at greasy spoon fast food joint. Could not contact family. Too many trying to access Internet. Not a way to start or end a holiday. Get new planes!

### "seats are so narrow"
Vancouver to Cancun with Air Transat, Seats 14 option Plus. Seats are so narrow that the pressure on the hips for six hours was not pleasant at all. Cabin service on both flights terrible. Attendants passing down the isle were hitting the shoulders of most passengers. Given a choice now we would never fly with Air Transat again.

### "problems with Air Transat"
We booked in at 16.45 and were told the flight was on time. At 20.00 hours we were told there were delays of an hour. At 21.30 we were told that a technical issue was being worked on the plane. At 22.30 we were told that the pilot was coming to talk to us. He explained there was a safety issue which was being worked on which was ongoing all day! At 23.30 we were told that work was still ongoing but the flight crew left the plane a walked through the departure lounge. At midnight we were told the flight was cancelled and plane would be replaced for noon the next day. We were given a hotel room for the night but with no luggage which we finally got to bed at 02.00 hours. The next day we ultimately left Toronto airport at 13.30 and arrived At Gatwick the next day at 01.30am UK time - 19 hours late. No trains etc available at that time of night. Arranged a taxi to pick us up at addition cost with no reimbursement to date from Air Transat. Throughout the flight there was no film entertainment on the screens. This is not the first time we have had problems with Air Transat. We had problems with reserved seats and no food for the flight.

### "extremely exasperating"
Curacao to Toronto. Flight TS 619 was scheduled to leave at 3:55 pm on December 27, 2015. The entire planeload arrived at the Curacao airport at approximately 12:30 pm. There was no signage or TV monitors indicating where the check-in desks for Air Transat were. We all waited in the airport looking around and asking numerous people where the Air Transat check-in counters were. No one knew. Even an airport official with a yellow shirt which read "ASK ME FOR HELP", knew nothing about Air Transat's ground crew at the airport. Finally, at about 1:30, four Air Transat staff casually walked into the airport and set up their counters where 12 passengers were standing, away form the 200+ that were waiting since 12:30. There was a mad stampede to get to those four check-in counters. Then it appeared that they were having problems with the computer and told us that indeed there was a computer problem and they were awaiting assistance. It took another 25 minutes before the first boarding pass was handed out to a loud round of applause. This all became extremely exasperating especially for those adults with kids. There was even one elderly lady in a wheel chair. When we finally boarded those who paid for pre-selected seats realized that their seats were occupied. More confusion and confrontations occurred on board as some exasperated passengers refused to give up their seats to those who had prepaid for them. The pilot apologized at least three times for the many inconveniences.

### "making this trip a little easier"
My husband and I went to Peurto Plata with Air Transat leaving Toronto on November 23rd and returned on December 7th. There was a huge difference when we flew back on TA797. I had fallen at the resort and broken my leg and had to have surgery there. Coming home was a big concern, but the staff at the airport were amazing. I did have to see the doctor at the airport and then I was taken through the process of checking in. They had managed to get me three seats that were empty and I took up the three of them with my cast etc. Cabin staff was absolutely amazing, because getting me down the aisle was no easy feat, and of course I felt guilty about holding everything up. I was in a great deal of pain and I just wanted to get home to Canada. I felt very ill when we took off and they gave me ice chips which helped immensely. I was the last to leave the plane and we ran into the problem of no wheelchair with the left leg extension which was going to be a big problem. But between the maintenance staff and cabin staff they rigged up a milk crate to the front of the wheelchair so both my legs rested on it. It caused quite a stir in the airport. We also had someone there who took us through Customs and the young lady stayed with me while my husband waited for our daughter who was picking us up. There was still the issue of getting me in the car and she stayed and helped. Air Transat thank you so much for making this trip home a little easier to bear.

### "never travel with them again"
We have been waiting for a delayed Air Transat flight 5 hours, we asked for a report from them as to the delay issue, because our insurance requires it to reimburse any expenses. They refused to provide it. They gave us a 20.00 food voucher instead. Then we finally got word that we are boarding and they tell us the entire right side of the plane has no power. Unreal. Never will travel with them again.

### "not impressed"
Toronto to Mexico with Air Transat. Not impressed with the ground staff. Flight was delayed due to crew issues. Not even on the flight yet, and to be honest probably never flying with this airline again. I understand if a delay is due to an error in a plane check or a malfunction detected, but when an airlines own employees can't ensure good service then there is no reason to fly with a company like this.

### "decent entertainment a must"
I was disappointed to find that this Air Transat aircraft was only fitted with TV screens in the ceiling and not with individual screens in the rear of the seats. This was a long haul flight so a decent entertainment system is a must. I had this aircraft on both inbound and outbound legs which is not good. The screen configuration reminds me of charter flights I used to go on in the 80's. I appreciate that this not a new aircraft, the first A310 was delivered in 1983 and the last in 1997 but this type of aircraft should either be updated or not used on long haul. I have checked to see if it was still going to be used in 2016 and was told it was unless the passenger numbers increased and a larger aircraft such as a A330 was used which of course have a modern entertainment system.

### "such a pleasurable trip"
My short 50 minute flight from Toronto to Montreal with Air Transat was such a pleasurable trip. The plane was clean and we departed on time. The flight was almost empty with at most 30 passengers. The crew was very kind and sat down with some of the customers to chat as they served us. All instructions were delivered in both French and English, which was very nice. We were given a light snack and a refreshment for in-flight food.

### "most pleasurable experience"
My flight on Air Transat A310 was eagerly anticipated and I was not disappointed. The aircraft (although by todays standards was rather aged), was good to look at. Onboard the seats were comfy, spacious and we had plenty of legroom. The flight attendants were helpful and charming with a bright smile. Food was OK but airline food is airline food - drinks were served regularly. The only thing I was not happy with was the small cabin screens above centre aisle of seats which made it difficult to watch the inflight entertainment but, on the plus side, the wifi (for IFE app) worked well. Hats off to the pilot of our return trip who had to go around again before completing a tricky landing back at Manchester. Thank you so much for a most pleasurable experience and making our vacation complete.

### "poor treatment received"
We returned from a fabulous vacation in Italy and unfortunately ended the holiday with the worst service and attitude I have ever experienced. The Air Transat flight to Rome was fine and the flight attendants very pleasant. Not so on the route home. They were just short of being rude. They certainly did not seem to enjoy their jobs or working with each other. Customer service jobs are difficult at times, but that is the career they chose and if they are having a bad shift they should not be taking it out on their customers. It was evident they just wanted to get home. I did write the airline because I was so shocked at the poor treatment we received. We have flown many times and a lot of those trips were with Air Transat. Flight attendants need to remember we are all strapped in our seats for a long flight and have nothing to do but listen and watch!

### "flight did not exist"
A terrible experience. We were booked with option plus on TS 704 to fly home from Calgary. Got there early and discovered flight did not exist and no staff anywhere. Eventually thanks to airport staff we found staff who checked us on to a different Air Transat flight later in day. On return our agents discovered that Air Transat had failed to tell us of the change of flight. They offered to apologise but in fact wrote saying they were sorry we were disappointed! Eventually offered to refund the amount we had paid for confirmed seats which we did not get, and months later have still not received the promised money. Really terrible customer experience.

### "nothing but praise for them"
This was the second time we have flown with Air Transat and have nothing but praise for them. We flew in their Club Class which is deemed as Premium Economy by some travel agents. If I could get this kind of comfort and service for the price charged by Air Transat from an airline offering Premium Economy I would not fly Business Class again. The crew were exceptional - friendly and attentive. The IFE was very good - managed to watch two recently released films that I hadn't managed to catch in our local cinema. Food was quite good and the drinks service exceptional - I know of no other airline offering Grand Marnier liqueur as part of their free drinks. Overall exceptionally good value for money and if we are going to return to Canada we would definitely be booking Air Transat.

### "awful return flight"
This has got to have been the most awful return flight to Toronto I have been on and I have been travelling there for over 30 years. I thought the old days of "cattle truck" air travel had gone. I think the reason for this is that Air Transat do not have any competition for this route and so they treat their customers accordingly. This plane (return flight) was more suited to short haul not a transatlantic flight. More rows of seats have been added in economy and so squashed together knees touch the seat in front and you have to slide in to your seat. The new "slimline" seats are more suited to people of child size. I am 9st 12lb and was still overhanging the next seat and so constantly changed my neighbours radio station (controls on top of arm rest) on numerous occasions. This had a knock on effect and was happening all over the plane. Everyone in economy was complaining about the space provided. It was an absolute disgrace - never again. Seats not cheap £500+ return for economy. Please will some other airline take up the Manchester - Toronto (Lester Pearson) route again. It is desperately needed. Next trip I will travel and have a 1 stop rather than endure that rubbish again. If you have any choice at all - do not travel this route.

### "cheapest way to Vancouver"
Gatwick to Vancouver return with Air Transat. Outbound flight on 2001 build A330, return flight on 2008 build A330 both aircraft were clean and well kept. Mainly French Canadian cabin crew were polite and professional, seat pitch ok but seat very narrow as aircraft is high density 9 abreast configuration, seat comfort not great for long haul flight, very difficult to get comfortable. Pillows headphones blanket etc have to be paid for and credit card is only payment method accepted. In flight entertainment good and single jack socket means you can use your own headphones! food ok as far as airline food goes, all in all was a pleasant experience on both inbound and return flights, and earlier arrival at YVR makes things much easier for those whose final destination is beyond Metro Vancouver. By far the cheapest way to get to Vancouver from the UK and perfectly ok just as long as you're not expecting Cathay Pacific or Singapore airlines levels of comfort and service

### "impressed with Air Transat kids club"
So impressed with Air Transat kids club! We had fantastic service the whole time because we had children. My kids received priority baggage, snacks on the plane, first to be seated. The list goes on. Thank you Air Transat for making my kids first flying experience a great one.

### "good value for money"
Toronto to Glasgow with Air Transat. Seats were reasonable, however not a lot of space (leg room and arm room). Food was great on the way to Toronto, not on the way back however. Some of the cabin crew were friendly, however the majority of them were very abrupt and rude. They sometimes refused to speak English, and stuck to French Canadian, which I do not have an issue with - however when you are dealing with international passengers you should be polite and accommodate their needs. Our flight was delayed by 2 hours (while we were in the air) due to fog in Glasgow. I realise this was out of the airline control, however it would have been nice to of been updated more on the situation. Other than this, it is good value for money to fly with them, as they seem to be the cheapest flying from Scotland to Canada.

### "seats were comfortable"
We booked Air Transat with some concerns since past flights a few years ago were not very pleasant. A great surprise to see such an improvement in the plane and excellent customer service. The seats were comfortable. One review I read stated the very back seats were the worst because they did not recline. This is definitely not true since we had these seats going and they reclined just enough. The food was ok and we brought snacks. There were lots of movies to choose from. The bathrooms were properly maintained. Cabin crew very friendly and professional. Enjoyed the flight there and back.

### "never put my luggage on flight"
Air Transat lost my luggage from a flight from Toronto to Paris back in July. After many many attempts to find the missing luggage by contacting their customer service department in Montreal I was told things like, everyone on lunch no one can help you, it's a Friday no one around to help you. They finally admitted that they never put my luggage on my flight. Instead of enjoying the sights of Paris and missing my wine tour I spent 2 valuable vacation days buying essentials. I will never travel Air Transat again.

### "strongly recommend this airline"
From check-in to arrival, Air Transat was a pleasant experience. Helpful and friendly staff, aircraft was pristine. Seats in economy are never the most spacious, but the window seat that I chose was comparable to Air Canada and British Airways, but at a much cheaper price. I know you have to pay for blankets etc, but the savings on the fare outweigh the add-ons - you have the choice to pay for them or not. The food served was comparable to other carriers. I strongly recommend this airline, you could save a whole bunch of money.

### "wouldn't want to fly them again "
I flew Air Transat from Gatwick to Vancouver on 2nd October 2015. I was shocked by how rude most the staff were on this flight. Not all were, but the majority. For example my TV wasn't working and they just shrugged their shoulders and walked away. While waiting for the toilet, one air hostess shoved me to get a cup and didn't care, they spent most of their time sat down at the back. Food is as expected on a plane, I quite enjoyed the veggie option. Drink and other snacks aren't free. So one bit of advise is take on some snacks as the meals are small. Really wasn't the most pleasant trip, wouldn't want to fly with them again unless I had to.

### "overall a good service"
Manchester to Calgary Air Transat flight was delayed 55 mins for technical reasons. Left stand and then returned. The staff and service were good. Food was of a good standard and the drinks service was regular. Overall a good service.

### "I would 100% recommend"
After reading some of the views we were nervous to fly with Air Transat, however we were extremely happy with the service! We weren't expecting food or entertainment however Air Transat provided free coffee and tea, snacks and also lunch and afternoon tea. The food was great either vegetarian or chicken then we received 2 pizza slices for afternoon tea. The entertainment was fantastic plenty of movies and TV shows also games and music, if you don't want to pay $8 being your own head phones. For the price we paid this was a fantastic deal, I would 100% recommend.

### "by far the worst flight"
Today we landed in Scotland, the Air Transat flight had been quite uneventful until our approach to Glasgow airport, then due to foggy conditions we were unable to land, so after circling the airport twice we were diverted to Prestwick which seemed okay. But when we landed we were kept on the apron for over an hour without any fresh air or toilet facilities and we were offered a small glass of warm water before we took off again! There were people needing to use toilets but were refused by cabin crew and some were young children. We were all very tired and very hot! Only the door at the front cabin was opened, so the rest of us were very uncomfortable. We and our families have flown Air Transat multiple times but this was by far the worst flight we have endured, some of the staff were okay, however we did notice some were quite rude to other travelers!

### "beware anyone flying this route"
Toronto to Manchester via Glasgow. We have flown Air Transat many times and were quite satisfied but this time our flight out with a stop in Glasgow was horrendous. I'm sure they will say it's not their fault but to allow their customers who are paying top dollar for this flight to be treated in this manner is deplorable. We knew we were to stop in Glasgow, we had done this last year, no problem but did not have to deplane. After barely 2 hrs sleep we were woken up to be told that maybe we would have to deplane and go through security in Glasgow and then reboard. We would only find out after landing! Approx 5 mins after landing we were told to take all our hand luggage and deplane to go through security. There were young families on board with young children that had to be woken up, totally unacceptable. Then proceeded to security, had to line up etc etc the whole nine yards. Isn't Canadian security good enough! We hadn't stopped anywhere while flying over the Atlantic so, was this a make work project for the the Scots. Beware anyone flying this route!

### "travelling longer distances in relative comfort"
Myself and a companion flew Air Transat on a one-way leg between Toronto Pearson Airport and London Gatwick. We chose Club Class, seats 1H, 1K. Club Class would be considered a poor man's business class, however, believe that is an apples to oranges comparison. Transat's Club Class is more aligned to a Premium Economy product and that is the class I've denoted in the review profile. All considered, Club Class seats are fairly comfortable with generous width; pitch, however, is on the tight side (36"), particularly for the second of two rows that make up Club Class. The first row has greater distance between back of chair and the bulkhead, however, these seats do not have a foot rest as do the second row. Not having a foot rest does make a difference over a longer flight; I recommend a portable (inflatable) foot rest that will make a world of difference. Given a choice, choose the first row over the second as it is more spacious and you'll avoid a reclined chair invading your space. As well, go row 1 on the right side of the aircraft as the one Club Class washroom is just adjacent to seats 1C and 1F. Inflight amenities include blanket, neck pillow, socks, slippers, toothbrush with paste, and head phones. The inflight entertainment system is easy to use and full of films, shows, games and music. The dining experience in Club Class is so-so. The cold meat plate offered on overnight flights is sparse and unappealing in look and taste. The only positive aspect is the hot soup offered. Breakfast in Club Class is similar, the best option is the cold breakfast which offers a varied fruit selection, yogurt, bran cereal, and rolls. Avoid the egg dishes, bland and unappetizing. Service was very positive. Flight staff were professional, personable, friendly and present. Club Class pre-boarding is helpful as flights tend to be crowded and Terminal 3 (Toronto Pearson) organization of gates makes for chaotic boarding generally. While they may board first, Club Class passengers do not deplane first but the delay to disembark is not a material one. In summary, Air Transat Club Class is a decent means of travelling longer distances in relative comfort and this particular flight proved it.

### "we're still here, wondering and waiting"
Air Transat aircraft problem was announced at gate by staff. Staff just gave out lunch vouchers, told passengers to go back to Departures lounge and watch for notuces. Then the staff closed the gate and left! Despite telling 200 passengers to watch boards for info, no information appeared on departure boards. No holding note eg. awaiting info". Just 'gate closed'. So passengers were left to wander around the airport in limbo. For 2 hours, and we're still here, wondering and waiting.

### "sleep impossible on the long flight"
My wife and I travelled Air Transat  to Ireland in August and this was the worst air travel I have experienced. At Pearson on day of departure the weather was warm and upon entering the cabin we were struck with a wave of sweltering heat and it stayed that way until we pulled away from the gate. The seats on the plane are the smallest and most uncomfortable I have experienced. There seems to be a lumbar support that doesn't allow you to rest your head on the head rest without either a pillow or some item of clothing stuffed behind your head, oh and by the way, pillows are not supplied, you must purchase them. The aisles are so narrow that you are bumped by most passengers and carts travelling up and down the aisle, making sleep impossible on the long flight. The flight attendants were courteous and helpful. You couldn't watch the movies unless you brought your own headphones or purchased them from the airline and the monitors were small and only located in the center of the aircraft. The food was terrible, on the way up some sort of penne pasta that was mushy and tasteless and on the way back some sort of chicken that was drenched in some sort of tasteless white sauce. The only good thing was the scotch toffee. The washrooms were filthy by the end of the flight. I would not recommend this airline and never plan to fly them again.

### "will recommend to other travellers"
Toronto to Varadero with Air Transat. Checked in online then dropped bags at Pearson with a 5-minute wait. Agent did not charge for excess though was 3 kilos over on one bag. Full flight and delayed as disembarking passengers from another flight were crossing the entrance to our air bridge. Seating was fine, leg-room was surprisingly OK and cabin very clean and well maintained (these 737s are recent additions to fleet). Dropdown screens OK and crisp picture and audio. Onboard meals of decent quality if a bit pricy. Staff were professional on both legs. Departure from Varadero a bit chaotic as incoming plane was a bit late. With announcements of 5 hour and 3 hour delays on other carriers to Canada we were happy with the eventual 1/2 hour delay. Kudos to Air Transat staff for their friendly attitude especially with the kids on board. Will recommend to other travellers.

### "crew made the trip enjoyable"
Flying Air Transat  Club Class - gluten free meal preordered, food was very nice. But what was worth the review was the crew. They made the trip quite enjoyable. The crew member that generally dealt with us had a graceful, good nature and provided us with warm and caring service throughout. There was no lacking on our flight. Many thanks.

### "knocks BA Premium Economy into a cocked hat"
So this is a brief review of our return from Vancouver to Gatwick in "Club" with Air Transat. This time we were in the middle section seats 1D and 1G. The legroom is enormous in this pair of seats. Welcome OJ or "Champagne", quick drinks service but then a lot of turbulence which delayed dinner - but eventually food nicely served again in individual courses. Great IFE again with some different films. I suppose my only complaint is that the galley is in front of you and is busy with crew moving about - for night time they ought to have a lower light level in the galley to cause less disturbance if you are sleeping. Nice breakfast - OJ, platter of fresh fruits, yogurts, plenty of danishes and fresh brewed cafetiere coffee - all on china. I have to repeat that it would be nice to get off the plane first. Once again a great flight and knocks BA Premium Economy into a cocked hat.

### "I can't say that it's satisfactory"
I flew Air Transat from Barcelona to Montreal return, in August 2015. My experiency isn't horrible, but I can't say that it's satisfactory. Both planes were too uncomfortable for a long flight, with very little room in the seats. Food is bad, but that's common in many airlines. On the return flight to Montreal(at night) they decided two hours before arriving to Barcelona that time for sleep has already finished, and they turned lights on, speakers etc,, whereas most of the passengers had been sleeping only for three hours, so they make jetlag even worse. The worst of all was that I travelled with my two children (14 and 8), and we got separated from each other! We were all seated in separate seat areas on the return flight. I'd never seen something like that not even in the worst low cost companies. Shame on them!

### "will definitely fly with Air Transat again"
This was my first time flying from Toronto to London Gatwick with Air Transat and I have no complaints. We were greeted by friendly attendants. The plane layout was 3x3x3 seating. I paid for seat selection so was seated in the two seat section at the tail of the plane. Attendants consisted of senior staff who were friendly and responded to requests with courtesy. Someone mentioned in a review that the seats at the very back do not recline. I was in the second last row window side, and the girls behind me had their seats reclined and they were the last row. Dinner was served on the flight, but I didn't have any because I was trying to sleep. Inflight entertainment consisted of a mixture of new releases and older movies. You could also track your flight. All entertainment is located at the back of the headrest in front of you. Bring your own headphones or pay for them from Air Transat for $9. As we approached the U.K. they came around with breakfast which I chose a slice of very moist banana bread and a beverage of choice. Leaving the plane they thanked us for travelling with them and they wished us well on our trip. After reading many negative reviews I was a bit nervous to fly this airline, but I discovered it is a budget airline so you get what you pay for. I will definitely fly with Air Transat again.

### "not what we had expected"
Our most recent trip, Montreal to Paris with Air Transat was not what we had expected given our previous experience, which was great, a few years ago. We flew into Paris CDG airport from Montreal at the beginning of August. The treatment we received on board in Club Class was excellent but when we landed the nightmare began! Not only did we not get off first, we were herded off of the plane and down two sets of portable stairs to waiting, unairconditioned buses which had been sitting on the tarmac in 32°C heat. The buses had approximately eight actual seats but were filled by about 35-40 passengers who had to stand in the oppressive heat. Once we finally arrived at the terminal we also found that there was no priority line for Club Class passengers. Our return trip through CDG was just as bad with no priority lines and long waits until we got to our gate. Once at the gate the Air Transat staff were inattentive and unprofessional. The monitor indicated that our flight was on time but we had yet to be processed up to five minutes before our supposed departure. I went up and asked what the problem was and was informed that our flight was delayed. I then told them that maybe they should share that info with the passengers as their monitor still indicated that we were "on time". We were finally processed and then once again herded onto overheated buses which sat, full of passengers, for ten minutes in 35°C before allowing anyone to board. Not the "Club Class" service I had anticipated! I filed a formal complaint with the airline but have no illusions as to the likely outcome. I will say that the onboard service was great but the second row window seats in Club Class are brutal to try and get out of. I would still likely fly Air Transat but would avoid Paris CDG airport like the plague!

### "seats are wider and fairly comfortable"
I flew Air Transat "Club" class in April of this year on a trip from Toronto to Gatwick return. The cost is slightly above their premium economy, but well worth it. 12 seats in the cabin. Seats are wider and fairly comfortable (I personally don't like the leather seats). Drinks before take off. Hot towel service. Meals were great (dinner and breakfast) all served on china in courses. All alcohol is free. A great cup of tea. Service by cabin crew was great. Nice comfort package containing ear buds, toothbrush/paste, sleep mask for your eyes and blow up neck pillow. Blankets provided as well (you pay for this in economy). In-flight entertainment was very good and each seat had its own screen. Priority bag tags (they actually did come off the plane first. As already mentioned, you do not get off the plane first. Overall I preferred this over a BA Business Class trip I took about 1 month after. Sure, you don't get a private lounge (BA lounge in YYZ was great, but awful at Heathrow ) but pay a couple of dollars and use a private lounge in your airport and your set. Well worth the upgrade and money.

### Air Transat customer review
All inclusive booking Vancouver to Puerto Vallarta. Notified of a 17 hour delay, 12 hours in advance. Delay was actually 18.5 hours at 215 am. Offered 100 dollars compensation, roughly the amount for the all inclusive services we paid for that we never received. Emailed Air Transat outlining the extra costs we incurred due to the delay, thinking they would offer credit for a future flight. Denied. Emailed a nice reply back to their customer relations department and they ignored it. Won't fly Air Transat ever again. Incidentally, we've been on other all inclusive holidays where Air Transat has changed flights and people were shortchanged a full day. Do your due diligence before flying Air Transat.

### Air Transat customer review
A very pleasant experience starting with check in right through to leaving the aircraft in Calgary. The extra legroom seats we booked were great if not a little narrow in the seat. The cabin crew could not have been more friendly or attentive as was the Captain who came into the cabin before leaving Gatwick to address the passengers on the tannoy "face to face" so to speak. Very personal and friendly approach which we had never experienced before. The food was pallatable to the point that my wife ate an inflight meal for the first time ever in almost 30 years of air travel. The refurbished cabin was very pleasant and nicely lit. All in all a very good flight.

### Air Transat customer review
We fly to Vancouver at least 3 times a year to see our daughter. We have used Air Canada mostly but also British Airways and Virgin Atlantic before they stopped this route. Air Canada's Economy since they squeezed an extra seat in each row is awful and their premium economy is just OK. BA uses ageing 747's and premium economy (WT+) is just OK. Air Transat Economy is also tight with a 3-3-3 configuration but their new "Club" is just 2-2-2 and looked attractive so we decided to give it a try - pricewise it is about the same as AC and BA premium economy. However, in our opinion having just completed the outbound flight it is streets ahead of BA and AC. We had 1A and 1C and the leg room and width is fine. The screens for the entertainment are fantastic (especially compared to BA) and the AVOD system worked well (although my wife's did need a reboot half way through the flight). The meal service was great - served course by course on nice china with smart cutlery. Choice of wines from the bottle. With only 12 seats the service was miles ahead of PE in BA and AC. Nice snack prior to landing, again on nice china with a drinks service. The coffee was excellent - not the usual rubbish. Personally I would put this "Club Transat" mid way between PE and business. The only downside - you are not first off the plane - it is a shame Transat can not organise this. So, as you may gather - I am a convert. The problem is there are not daily flights and they soon get booked up - I am already looking at booking the next trip.

### Air Transat customer review
Excellent service from flight attendants on the way into and on the return from Barcelona. The Food was terrible. If we had known about the bad reviews of the food, we would have purchased food before we got onboard. Air Transat, next time please deduct $50.00 off our ticket price for our meals.

### Air Transat customer review
The service that Transat now provide from Gatwick to Halifax has taken a backward step, they are now using a B737 aircraft, and this is a small cramped aircraft more suitable for a route from the UK to Europe rather than a transatlantic route. The journey time now depends on the weather, its gone from the normal time of approx 6.5 hours to 8.5 hours, included in this time is a stopover at Gander for a refuel, although none of this information is given until you are boarded, so it could be a direct flight or it could include a stopover at Gander as stated on your ticket. It is then too late to change the arrangement made for your collection at Halifax, on the plus side both flights left on time. The cabin staff were friendly, although I thought looking a bit untidy, the meals were ok, typical aircraft fare, a light breakfast or even a hot drink prior to arriving at Gatwick would have been appreciated

### Air Transat customer review
We will never fly with Air Transat again. The air crew were rude and we were afraid to ask for things as they would snap at you. This was on the outward journey, the seats were cramped and small, the food wasn't up to much either. Well lets brace ourselves for the homeward journey, not much better if only the air crew would smile. Inflight travel accessories you had to pay for - what a rip off.

### Air Transat customer review
The flights were on time and the aircraft was clean. Paid extra for option plus and extra leg room seats but this was not worth it. Priority check in was useful but was not called for priority boarding. Extra leg room was good but the 9 unoccupied seats with extra leg room were soon taken up after take off by none paying passengers. Small bottle of sparkling wine and small box of pringles were given plus comfort pack - everything else was the same as other passengers. We did not get priority luggage on arrival and staff were not very friendly.

### Air Transat customer review
By far one of the best flights I've been on, very impressive for a "leisure" airline. The service at Pearson Terminal 3 was speedy, and gate C32 had a beautiful view of the runway. When we boarded the A330 I was pleased to see their new "mood lighting" feature which added timed hues to the cabin atmosphere. Furthermore, I was delighted to see an extremely well kept cabin, the personal TV's were scratchless and shiny. Around midnight, we were served a hot meal, and I ordered the "Chipotle Chicken". Upon flying over Ireland, we were given a banana bread and juice breakfast, which was nice, albeit small. The landing was excellent and the taxi to the gate was quick.

### Air Transat customer review
Travelled to Canada on the 14th June 2015 and service was what I would expect from a budget airline. During the flight, drinks were offered about every half hour and meals were about an hour or two after takeoff and before landing. Seats are a bit cramped but that's what you should expect from a 3-3-3 seat config, entertainment was okay, films were a mixture of new releases to old films although they only had a few films that were for the adult passengers. This airline is the best if you want low cost flights with the service you would expect from them, if you compare Air Transat to Air Canada there is a $1000 difference in ticket price. In my opinion its worth every penny.

### Air Transat customer review
I discovered two separate and unrelated pairs of people who had paid for the upgrade service and not received it. A couple had paid for extra leg room seats and not received them on a prior flight. On the flight I took, a couple of elderly passengers had paid a fee to ensure they would be given seats beside each other, they did not get those seats. Air Transat offered the older passenger a seat at the back of the plane away from her friend that she had paid extra to sit beside. She refused, I offered to go to the seat at the back of the plane and gave her my seat. Staff were rude and ungracious to me and the elderly passenger. They only offered refreshments with meals. They did not offer them any other time. In addition, the meal was not good. The salad and bread were okay, but the main course seemed to almost be instant cheap rice. The chicken meal consisted of two pieces of chicken, basically non existent. I paid $1,000 for the return flight from Canada. I could have flown Air Canada Rouge for about the same price.

### Air Transat customer review
Outbound the crew were surly, none of them smiled and none of them ever called us "sir or madam". The seats are extremely cramped and the hot meal not brilliant at all, so very tiny in size. On the return the crew were even more off hand, still no smiles or respect for anyone. The hot meal was served, 25 minutes later came the wine and another 20 minutes later came the coffee. We were never offered refills on either flight. Also on the return, the seat back GPS flight information screen did not work and the flight deck crew did not once tell us where we were, what altitude / speed we were at nor did they speak at all until we were on final approach. The announcements by the cabin crew on both legs was in very stilted, rushed and of poor English, but then done in a nice slow refined and perfect French. At least we were almost on time both ways, so it was just about OK.

### Air Transat customer review
A bit of a mixed bag. Flew out LGW-YVR, returned YYC-LGW. Positives: Both flights on time, aircrafts were clean and  priority boarding worked well. Food is fine, (starter and dessert the same on both flights). Pre-arrival snack outbound good, and breakfast on the return benefitted from some excellent fresh fruit, shame the only hot element was a single cinamon bun. Drinks always being offered. Both crews efficient, and slightly more friendly on the return flight. Drawbacks - Seats ok, but recline in their 'Club' class is not to Business class standards, nor is the seat pitch. Very much equivalent to a Premimum Economy offering. No priority when leaving the aircraft, so economy pax near the No2 door got off first - rather poor. AVOID but choices limited and no descriptions of what is included in the radio selections. Main courses for meals were good but the rest a tad disappointing. TSC has some positives which I expect puts it on a par or ahead of similar airlines, but its Club product lags behind some of the better airlines.

### Air Transat customer review
Having read negative reviews of Air Transat we were apprehensive on flying with this airline. Having traveled, we found the whole experience very enjoyable. The cabin crew were excellent on both legs.

### Air Transat customer review
We had a terrible time on this flight from Manchester to Calgary. Flight attendants were rude. Seats were uncomfortable. We booked our seats at the back of the plane but found the level of service was poorly conducted. When the meal service started from the front of the plane, they had run out of meals by the time they reached us. We had to take what was left which was tasteless and we could not eat it. My husband asked if we could purchase a snack from the bistro menu but were told they were not sold on this flight. On our return journey we were met with the same situation, no choice and had to take what was left. The flight attendant was very rude when I told her this had happened to us on the outward journey. She told us that "this is what happens when you book a seat at the back of the plane". I have flown with many airlines over the years and have never received such a shabby service. On a long haul flight there should be adequate meals to ensure everyone has a choice. I paid to book those seats on the plane, many passengers on that flight had not booked their seats but had a choice of meal.

### Air Transat customer review
My polite complaint received an automated "Rest assured we will respond in no more than 30 days", which never happened. And my follow up after 60 days, was ignored. My seat was assigned to another passenger, even though I was holding a boarding card with the same seat number. Wheelchair assistance for my mother was not arranged in Amsterdam. Airport crew tried but could not come up with a solution as the airport was busy. And after this being told that they had left our luggage back in Vancouver. A simple sorry goes a long way.

### Air Transat customer review
Our flight was delayed by 5 hours from Cancun back to Calgary. Communication was very poor throughout the process. Information was not provided and the flight crew were left to deal with frustrated travellers. Air Transat could have offered complimentary snacks or even bottled water while travellers who left their all inclusive resorts were inconvenienced at a hot stuffy airport for hours being forced to purchase over priced fast food. Air Transat flights are uncomfortable with small seats even for petite people with zero entertainment, poor selection of magazines, terrible buy on board options. The only saving grace is under valued crew that are left to apologize on behalf of a sub standard airline with zero public relations skills

### Air Transat customer review
The more or less punctuality of the flight (20 min. delay), and the safety where the only good things of the flight. The flight attendants were rude, the meal was tasteless and was served 1hr 45mins after take off (on a night and transatlantic flight they should be much faster like other airlines). They took my plate back 1.5 hours after I received it. The seats are uncomfortable if you are more than 1m90 tall. No individual TV screens. You have to pay in order to have a headset. Moreover, we waited 1.5 hours for our bags at Marseille Airport (not the fault of Air Transat).

### Air Transat customer review
We arrived at the airport 4 hours early and the plane was already at the gate. When we boarded the entertainment system was not working and one of the toilets was out of service, the staff were very friendly and everything else was as it should be. The return flight, when we got to the airport they had changed the plane, we purposely booked that specific flight because it had a A330 on it and it was changed to a A310, the reason we booked that flight as it has the in seat entertainment system on the A330 but not on the ancient A310's they are flying. I flew with them 2 years ago and they told me then that the A310's were supposed to be gone within a year. When I got home I emailed them and I got the automatic reply but they never did contact me regarding my concerns.

### Air Transat customer review
Inconsistent. Good flight from LGW, average from YUL Montreal. Outbound: We paid extra for Option Plus, which on this occasion was well worth it. We avoided check-in queues, used the fast track security lane, boarded first and our baggage was given priority on arrival. It also gave us a total luggage allowance of 33kg over two bags. On board we were given a comfort kit, sparkling wine, snack and an alcoholic drink. Food was bearable - no different really to any other airline. Leg room was adequate and seats had a good recline, but they are not very wide, so it was very uncomfortable and I'm not a big person. I was concerned when I discovered the A310 doesn't have individual screens. Instead you have to watch on your iphone or tablet and there is no method of charging your device. Film choices appeared OK and battery held up surprisingly well. All in all we were pleasantly surprised, although our expectation couldn't be any lower because we had read all the negative reviews. Inbound: Long wait at check in, just one person checking in Option Plus passengers. Despite having priority security with our ticket we were ushered through main security lanes. Flight was slightly delayed. No apology or explanation in fact it wasn't even mention. Seat made it very uncomfortable and difficult to sleep. Food service was bizarre. Main pasta dish after midnight and breakfast was just a piece of banana bread! And "priority bags" appeared to come off at the same time as the others.

### Air Transat customer review
I travel frequently with Air Transat in Club Class. The service is always great and the best part is the larger seat which is great for sleeping. The food is not always the greatest and the menu has not changed in the 10 years I have flown with them, but the early boarding and extra leg room along with a dedicated washroom makes this a pleasant experience.

### Air Transat customer review
Overall an excellent experience. Flights on time. Totally professional and customer service focussed air crew. Friendly, helpful staff. Great cabin, good leg room, good entertainment system and choice of films. No negatives. Food – overall, quite pleasant. Drinks service – excellent.

### Air Transat customer review
Yet again Air Transat have changed a flight time on me. It seems they regularly change their departure times after you purchase your ticket. This time it was brought forward 5 hours making it impossible for me to make the connection. Their response is "it happens" and can happen up to 24 hours before departure. Either pay a change fee or wait to see it it changed again. They really don't have any customer service. Its all about the contract. I appreciate sometimes due to flight volumes at an airport minor changes occur, but Air Transat do it regularly and by significant amounts. My advice would be not to book with them unless you are flexible with you dates (up to 24 hrs before departure) or have no connecting flight.

### Air Transat customer review
I found the service very mediocre, we were delayed for nearly 2 hours in Toronto. On the 24th of June we were due to take off at 9.55pm and it took until 10.20/30 for the pilot to tell us we were delayed due to the fact that they need a tyre changed on the aeroplane! This was not too much of a problem but time went on and we were not offered any refeshments while waiting for takeoff. It was hot and stuffy, and it was only when several passengers started asking for water, including myself, that they decided to go around with a jug of water and small plastic glasses. The plane did not take off until 11.55. We got dinner at 1.00am in the morning and breakfast was a slice of cake and a hot dinner, who has cake for breakfast! I know its any economy airline, but surely refreshments should have been offered if the plane was delyed and what nutritional value does cake have for breakfast?

### Air Transat customer review
I flew 'Club' class with Air Transat 01/07/15, from LGW to YYZ. Although they call it Club, it is in actuality Premium Economy, and  I was very impressed. The seat is comfortable. The food plentiful and tasty. Flight Attendants were friendly and welcoming. Great selection of movies and tv shows on demand on a good sized screen.

### Air Transat customer review
Pleasantly suprised. Old A310 (thought it was going to be an A330). Check in fairly uncomplicated at Toronto. Great deal on bringing bikes to Europe C$30 (counts as your 2nd bag in Business). Crew friendly on board. Meal was ok. Seat like the the old J class on mainline carriers. I suspect that when it works its great any delays or problems and then you are kind of stuck (charter airline) Fare was pretty good. I have yet to try Premium economy on Lufthansa but will do so later this year. Some better deal on Lounge access would be an added touch.

### Air Transat customer review
The check in system in Toronto does not work, more so when multiple flight are departing to UK within hours of each other. I requested to be fast forwarded as after waiting in huge queue I was within 45 mins of take off. I was eventually granted my wish, but when I got to customs I was met with another huge queue. By the time I got through security my name was being called for the flight which I almost missed. Due to lateness checking in my suitcase it has gone missing. I suggest seperate check in desks for UK destinations up untill flight departures

### Air Transat customer review
I have flown Air Transat quite a few times now and this was the first in their new planes. They have good leg space although the seats are narrow - narrowest I've ever experienced in a flight. It does not bother me personally but for a broader person this can be a real issue. They have upgraded their old entertainment system to something on par with AF/BA/KLM now, however that is only in the renovated planes. The food is as bad as it was, but I'd say that for the price this is to be expected. I never have any expectations regarding the food they will serve so I'm not disapointed. They are usually still the cheapest for CDG to YUL so if I wanted something a tad better I'd pay a bit more. The service is alright, of course it has nothing to do with 5-Star airlines but I'd say its decent for the price - and it has improved since the first times I flew with them 4 years ago.

### Air Transat customer review
Flight home a bit of an ordeal. Check in was meant to open at 14.30 but didn't open until 15.30. We were all on plane for 18.30 but plane did not leave stand until 19.30. Pilot told us it was to do with paper work (can he not read or write) or was it because we were waiting on an engineer to tighten a screw on one of the first class seats head rests, when there were several other empty seats. On landing in Glasgow the luggage took an hour to come through. However the cabin crews luggage managed to come through without delay. Might look at other airlines next time

### Air Transat customer review
Our flight from Calgary to Glasgow was a mixed bag. Just as we were flying over Hudson Bay, the pilot turn a sharp southerly turn and we diverted to Toronto. With no additional information other than "technical difficulties" due to "improper checks in Calgary" they were going to have to transfer us to another plane in Toronto. Our flight from Toronto to Glasgow was pretty uneventful. Our return flight was also uneventful, thankfully. I appreciate the lighting and ambient music that seems to play as boarding and de-planing takes place. It can really add to a zen atmosphere and help people who might be having some pre-flying jitters. One thing to note, Air Transat: get your food situation together! Each flight, we ended up basically getting the worst they had to offer meal-wise because none of the decent food was left as everyone before us had opted for it. I was not at all impressed by this. We booked seats towards the back of the plane to avoid screaming children as best as we could, only to suffer as far as meal options went. Be prepared to need more of the food you know people prefer. It just seems kind of cruel otherwise, subjecting the back 1/3 to 1/2 of the plane to the runs serving them the slop that's leftover.

### Air Transat customer review
I had read some of the reviews, so was a little concerned, but loved the price. There was no charge for our luggage! We got lunch, with a complimentary glass of wine at no extra cost. We also got a snack shortly before descending into Vancouver. The entertainment was in the seatback in front of me. Movies, TV shows, etc, again, no extra cost.

### Air Transat customer review
Had paid double price to upgrade to Club Class on way out, all was fine no problems. As we could not get into Club Class on the way back we paid an additional £48 at the Airport in Glasgow to Canadian Affair to travel Select Plus which means chosen seats, speedy check in, priority luggage, free soft drinks, headsets, etc in flight. Problems began at check in, took over 35 mins due to "system errors" eventually we were given two different seat numbers not our original seats. My son who was travelling with a sprained ankle and who is 6ft 4 had a broken seat, two rows from the back toilets (seats we would never have chosen). We pointed this out to the crew who tried to fix it but could not. We were advised we could not get our original seats as other people had paid for them and did not want to move. My son had to sit bolt upright for 6.5hrs. All this and more has been brought to the attention of Canadian Affair (who we have used at least 7 times in the past five years to fly to Toronto). Firstly offered me £30 then when I said this was not good enough took another 3 weeks to write back to me with all manner of excuses. If you can dont fly with this Company, fly Air Canada instead.

### Air Transat customer review
Despite some reviews on this site and others my experience with Air Transat was very pleasant. Yes the seats are a bit crowded together but that's par for the course on almost every airline these days. Food was better that expected it was quite good. In flight entertainment had a decent variety of current movies and TV shows to suite all ages and tastes. Quick check in, pleasant staff especially the flight attendants the service was very good. Would recommend Air Transat.

### Air Transat customer review
I just returned from about an 8 hour flight from Europe via Air Transat and I will never do this again. I have been flying to Europe for about 20 years and this was the most uncomfortable flight. For a long trip the seats are horrible if you are bigger then average or even if you are sitting next to people bigger then average and you have just entered air plane hell if you are caught in a middle seat. The food quality and quantity were also totally unacceptable. It was so bad that I would take a more non direct flight in the future at a higher price to avoid this experience again.

### Air Transat customer review
Bought upgrade at check-in. Superb value. It was only £200 for the upgrade to their business class. It is actually only a premium economy class but it was excellent. Brilliant service, very good food and very comfortable new seating. I was flying Manchester to Toronto which I do quite regularly.

### Air Transat customer review
Flight from Gatwick to Vancouver 21 May return to Gatwick 3rd June 2015. Dreadful. Wanted to charge 9 dollars for a blanket and 8 dollars for headset. Seats cramped. On return trip some seats had been double booked - fortunately they managed to sort that out but many people were unable to sit with their travelling companion. Dinner was poor with a piece of fudge for dessert and breakfast was a piece of banana bread. On the outward journey on 21st May they ran out of headsets so we spent a 10 hour flight without access to films or music. Would definitely not travel with this airline again and would not recommend it to anyone.

### Air Transat customer review
Flight TS560 Toronto (YYZ) - Punta Cana Dominican Republic (PUJ) May 15 2015. Travelled with 2 children aged 5 years and 1.8 years. When we tried to utilize online check in we were unable to do so. Contacted AT and were told that since there were 2 infants on the same booking (we were flying with other family members with infants) system and AT policy dictates that passengers must check in at the counter. Seems very strange as allowing people with children and infants would be better served with online check-in! AT lost my spouse's booking even though we had more then ample proof of payments and booking. We were told to contact AT customer service. We were told that AT just went through a system upgrade. To me it appears that a system downgrade occurred. Spoke with the supervisor who reluctantly contacted AT and resolved the issue. Check in time - just under 1 hour. Flight TS561 PUJ to YYZ due to the system upgrade check-in took over 1.75 hours (a lot of other customers were also complaining) at the end of which we were told that AT could not honour seat selection for 7 people in our party. Spoke with AT staff and asked for a reason and I was told that AT would be using a different plane. I asked and was advised that plane used would be Airbus 300-310 same plane we took from TO. When I asked the person for further clarification he indicated that each 310 has a different configuration. I asked whether 310 had rows 7 and 8 where we had booked our seats and the individual could not answer. Traveling with 2 infants and 3 children and checking in taking 1.75 hours and AT not allowing passengers to check in online if they have 2 infants is a prime example of an oxymoron. Shame on AT.

### Air Transat customer review
I paid for an upgrade on my flight from Manchester to Toronto. My wife and I fly this route frequently with Transat. This is simple. The service level in the mini business section (only 12 seats) was excellent. Given the very reasonable cost it was superb value. The service and comfort cannot be compared to business class in the top airlines but the value for money compared to others is remarkable. The business class section has recently been completely refitted and is very comfortable. Two months ago I travelled on the upper deck of a 747 with BA London to Dallas and the service today was much better than the flag carrier.

### Air Transat customer review
Just returned from Vancouver to London on a direct flight in club class. We were surprised and pleased with the level of service and the constant supply of food and drink the food was very good. The stewardess was very pleasant and professional. The airfares are much lower than other airlines. Those who complain about minor issues your not in a 5 star hotel for a week remember it's a cheap flight you've booked for a few hours travel. Pay a much higher price with a premium airline next time and then make a comparison. We will book again with Air Transat for our next trip to Canada.

### Air Transat customer review
On the outbound flight the interior of the plane seemed to be poorly maintained. The seatback it front was bent and twisted this made it difficult to raise or lower the tray. The passenger in front kept trying to get it to recline with the help of the flight attendant by pushing on it which caused it to bend more. The audio jack didn't work so there was no sound to watch the movie. On the return flight Air Transat uses Enerjet. The plane was a 737 the legroom was terrible & I'm average hight. Also the plane wasn't equipped with entertainment so no music or movie for a 6 hour trip. This was a surprise as their website indicates they provide movies on their international flights.

### Air Transat customer review
My trip was YYZ-PUJ (Punta Cana) May 9 out and 16 back. I have nothing but praise for this airline. Our flights were boarded on time and departed as such. The onboard service was exceptional friendly crew beautifully spacious A330 and fantastic entertainment package. Seats were comfortable and did not get the feeling of being cramped.

### Air Transat customer review
We flew to Punta Cana April 3-11 all went well until the return. What a nightmare. 4 Transat flights departing at the same time - 800 plus people in the airport. Its too small. Over 2 hours to check bags and customs standing no washrooms or water. Our flight was delayed 2 hours on top of this. When I contacted Air Transat all they say is sorry and things happen planes get delayed. A few years ago we were delayed from Vancouver missed our flight because of the weather. They simply told us we should be more prepared. I would recommend pay a little more to fly another airline.

### Air Transat customer review
Outbound YYZ-DUB TS 430 13/04. Return DUB-YYZ TS 431 21/04. Competitive comfortable economy on transatlantic flights. Few complaints. Direct non stop flights to UK and Ireland is a big bonus on convenience and on time travel.

TS 732 to Lisbon on April 19th. Cabin crew professional and courteous informative about rules kind to elderly passengers on board who didn't understand the language or had hearing problems. Food and beverages were served in a timely manner allowing passengers to get some sleep. Pilots were kind to introduce the team and give some flight information. Check in at airport was also smooth. I was seated in 23 A.

### Air Transat customer review
My family were booked on a family vacation to Cuba. The flight was held on the tarmac for more than 90 minutes for mechanical failures. After that we were brought back to our gate given a coupon of $15 for food and told to be at another gate for a 10pm departure. The plane that was to have flown us at 10pm had an emergency landing. We were then told we will not be flying till 9am next morning. Limited hotel space for all guests and families were lumped into single rooms. The next day we were flown on a A330 to Camaguey. The ground crew on the other end were totally unprepared for the flight. All in all our family vacation was reduced to losing a day and a credit given for future flight at a cost of $250/pp. Since this is the second time I've flown Air Transat and twice in-a-row that my vacation was reduced by a day (the first time was on my honeymoon to Italy) I will not fly Air Transat again.

### Air Transat customer review
LGW-YYZ. The outbound flight departed one hour late but arrived 5 minutes early so kudos to the pilots for making up the lost time (which was due to affairs outside of the airline's control). I was impressed with the quality of the food which both tasted good and sustained me well until I got to Canada and the wine was of good quality and I was pleasantly surprised by it as well as free non-alcoholic drinks throughout the flight! The in-flight entertainment system had a wide variety of options and I was kept entertained for much of the flight. The remainder of the time I was trying to sleep which given the leather seats and frugal legroom was rather difficult but surprisingly it was bearable for the 8 hour flight. The cost of the headphones didn't bother me as I brought my own with me and were compatible with the socket on the monitor. The flight crew were very charming and were happy to help with even the smallest of things (in my case filling in the landing card). The inbound flight back to London was much the same although one point I would make is that the overhead lighting made sleeping early on in the flight impossible as it was a bright orange for around 30 minutes after take-off before changing to a light blue and then to a dark purple. Would recommend bringing eye covers if you're intending to sleep on the red-eye flight. The flight crew were very polite in awaking passengers for breakfast which along with the dinner served 6 hours previously was small but tasty. I would definitely recommend flying with Air Transat as a very affordable way of flying from Europe to Canada and many of the costs for supplementary items can be easily offset - to avoid paying for a selected seat check in very early on so as to choose a good seat that hasn't already been chosen; to avoid the costs of headphones and blankets these can be brought with you onto the plane and the flight crew don't mind at all; the flight crew are also happy to move you to another seat if there is one free which is almost guaranteed on an Air Transat flight which are hardly ever fully booked.

### Air Transat customer review
We flew to Punta Cana for our vacation March 20-27. Thank goodness I paid extra for exit aisle seats because otherwise we never would have managed. The seats are far too small for normal human beings. I appreciate I am tall (just under 6 feet) as is my daughter - and that is why I paid to have the extra leg room but we were completely wedged in as were many other folks around us. I will not fly this airline again for this reason. I must say the staff were outstanding and made the flight a pleasure. Service was excellent very professional and friendly. My only complaint is they are clearly trying to stuff folks in to up their profits. I would also add their inflight entertainment was very good - lots of options.

### Air Transat customer review
Recent flight to Cuba from Ottawa and back. Flight left on time arrived in Cuba early. Departure from Cuba was early as well were back in Ottawa almost one hour early. That was the good part. The seats are small and cramped. We were on 737. I had no legroom at all had to stretch leg out into the isle just to get some room. Got a huge bruise on my outer thigh from trying to wedge into the seat very attractive for a beach vacation. (I am 6 ft tall and not overweight). No meals (which we knew) just a small snack bag of cookies and juice or pop. Kind of cheap. Staff seemed nice enough but with no meals to serve focus more on selling stuff. Overhead small screens for movies (which were good). Had my own headphones. Ok for the money but seats are very uncomfortable.

### Air Transat customer review
Flew from Gatwick to Toronto March 2015. Paid the extra for option plus. No problems checking in staff smiley at 4 in the morning. The only complaint is that after being at the airport at 4 am checking in boarding etc took off a little late due to the catering company being late loading the plane. But to be handed a piece of banana bread for a breakfast was disgusting. Very hungry by the time that dinner was served being option plus I mistakenly thought that I may get a choice prior to the serving nope - by the time that the FA's got to row 28 all they had was a rice dish full of peppers so I went hungry. Thought that perhaps a dessert might suffice. Well a piece of fudge does not cut it. Not the FA's fault but they must have had something else on board - no offer whatsoever. I will be sure to pack my own food next time if they can not do any better than that cut out the food. The inflight entertainment was terrible they need to complete the refurbishment of their aircraft with ear buds in my own you could not hear the words all you could hear was a buzzing sound.

Edmonton to Puerto Vallarta on Dec 27 2014 and back on Jan 10 2015. Excellent especially if you have kids! They have a special family line up which is so helpful and makes the airline stand out!

### Air Transat customer review
Took flight TS205 from San Jose to Montreal at 17.15 on Feb 27 2015. First issue was that they boarded plane from both ends at same time without regard to seat location. I was in the second to last row and was boarding from the front. Took 15 minutes to find our way to back of plane. Main problem was that someone forgot to order the right amount of food. This was a supper flight and we did not arrive till midnight. I estimate that half the passengers were given only a bag of peanuts for supper. From talking with the flight attendant seems this situation was not all that unusual. The worse part is that no one informed the passengers before boarding. We would have had plenty of time to buy some food before boarding. This airline is very inconsiderate of their passengers.

### Air Transat customer review
Recently returned from Costa Rica flight was on time there and back very old plane uncomfortable small seats only one movie to watch. Also flight was out of Montreal although most people are French speaking on it not all of us are. One stewardess could not or would not speak English and another passenger had to tell me what she wanted after I told her I didn't understand French. Very rude!

### Air Transat customer review
My husband and I took our first AT trip Vancouver - Puerto Vallerta last week. We were pleasantly surprised at the new Airbus lovely staff and service. Forget food expectations on such a reasonably priced flight. We did experience what we call charter "hell" to find our return flight to Vancouver cancelled for a day due to mechanical issue. We were fabulously managed: arrived at airport to hear that news at 1 pm - sent in private taxi to the newly renovated all inclusive Hyatt Ziva. Picked up 6 am next day for smooth flight back to Vancouver. In addition handed $150 credit voucher on boarding towards next flight anytime in the next 18 month. I would definitely travel AT again based on this trip.

### Air Transat customer review
I have flown Air Transat from Toronto to London almost every year and sometimes twice a year. I am a senior now and always buy option plus. Air Transat has always been very good to me. They are on time courteous and respectful. They are almost always on time and if not there is a very good reason. No it is not a luxury airline but it gets one from A to B safely and at reasonable cost. If you don't like the food take your own as I do. It is not necessary to have a full meal when you are only in the air for a few hours. Safety should always be your number 1 priority.

### Air Transat customer review
Just got back from Mayan Riviera on Air Transat flight. The flight was fabulous comfortable seats. Staff were friendly and helpful. Entertainment screen in the seat backs allowing you to choose a fairly recent movie from 20 or so selections. Planes were relatively new or redone. The only complaint I have is my daughter is celiac and there were no meals on the menu identified as gluten free. We upgraded to options plus but she was not able to eat. The only thing remotely close to GF is a fruit tray - however being celiac this can not be trusted. Could have been produced on the same cutting board using the same knife they use for gluten products.

### Air Transat customer review
Worst airline ever. Staff were rude and unhelpful. They were only concerned with selling food and duty free items. Took them an hour after just to get a drink of water from them. Even after I had already asked them twice. When you pay good money for a flight ($600-$800 per seat) you expect good service. Very unprofessional. I've flown with WestJet many times and never I have had these problems with them.

### Air Transat customer review
I travel with Air Transat 3 to 4 times a year from LGW to Toronto and have not as yet a complaint to make. I have found the crew up to now very helpful. I always travel option plus purely so I can be one of those that get settled on the plane first and for my suitcase being one of the first off at the other end. Also for extra luggage allowance I find this well worth it. I have also found the staff on the other end of the phone when I have a query are also very helpful. I hope this will continue.

### Air Transat customer review
Recently I boarded a flight on Air Transat travelling from Toronto to Punta Cana Dominican Republic. My recent experience seems to be in sync with most of the posts regarding service provided with this carrier delays in departure are to be expected. Delays are not a deal breaker for me as I embrace safety first. However simple customer service is what I expect from an airline carrier in the wake of extensive cutbacks to this industry. My complaint really is very simple. I requested a window seat well in advance to the closing of seat bookings. As I booked my seat with the airline representative at the airport I was guaranteed a window seat I had even reviewed with the agent that this was correct (I always double check my reservations bookings). Upon boarding the flight I found that my seat was not a window seat and that it was the last row of seats in the centre of the plane. It has been two weeks since my flight. I still don't understand why they would not tell me the truth. I watched the representative check the seat bookings on the computers like I have done countless times before. Overall after having travelled with almost all the airlines in the world to every continent in the world Air Transat falls well below customer service. I am by no means a person whom expects luxury I am happy to settle for the basics point A to B. I will never board another Air Transat flight.

We travelled Calgary to Puerto Vallarta in Feb 2015 and like others on this site were less than impressed. We expected the small seats and 'pay for any extra's' approach but thought it excessive when they wanted $9 for a blanket. After flying for 45 minutes shivering I put on my outer coat and asked if it would be warming up soon. Another 20 minutes and I asked for a blanket where the $9 charge was offered. Nice business model. When we arrived in PV I was pleased to see that there was a jetway since my mobility is poor but Air Transat doesn't use it according to the stewardess because it is an extra cost. So down the long stairs onto the pavement we all went. I only decided to comment when the online check-in offered out of Calgary did not work for PV. Scoured the website to see if it was one of those excluded with no specific comment. I see Punta Cana and other Mexican sites so it cannot be the in country affluence. What the heck AT? Can't the jet fuel savings be put into some minor customer sat focus?

Flight TS254 Dec 6 2014. My wife 11 month old son and myself were flying as Option Plus guests. Flight was scheduled to leave at 11 am. We boarded the flight at 10.25am sat on the plane until 12.30 pm then were asked to de-board while the plane was shut-down and restarted. At 4.30pm there was an update stating that food vouchers would be provided. Due to the long line up we did not get our two food vouchers until 5.15pm. Our supper at the airport was $60 much more than the food vouchers. At close to 6.00 pm there was an announcement stating the flight had been cancelled and rescheduled for the following morning at 10.00am. We went down to the luggage carousel got our luggage paid for parking and drove home. We arrived home at 9pm. Air Transat mismanaged the whole situation! We fly several times a year and never had a situation as mismanaged as this.

My wife and I are sitting at the airport while I'm writing this. We're on our way to Cancun from Toronto on an Air Transat flight #520 which was supposed to depart at 8.25am. They boarded most of us just to tell us that the plane needs repairs and we have to leave the plane. In about half hour we're told that the plane will be repaired and new departure will be at 1.50pm. About 11am we find out that the plane is fixed and will be at the gate in few minutes. Everyone was very happy but the happiness was vanquished when we found out that the crew was gone. They showed up at 12.30. It's 12.55 right now and we're still here. I appreciate them fixing the plane very much but the fact that the we have been sitting here for another hour watching the fixed plane outside the window without knowing how much longer it will take gets on my nerves. Never again.

### Air Transat customer review
Our yearly vacation to Cuba was a huge disappointment flying with Air Transat flight 121. We left Edmonton January 12 2015 returned January 19 2015. The flight left on time only to be told we now had to de-ice. I understand de-icing but couldn't this be done before 346 passengers are on board. Then the stop in Calgary to pick up more passengers was of course late leaving. And of course we had to fuel up in Calgary so more time on the ground. I would of thought fuelling up would be part of the plane being ready for the long journey not part of the passengers holidays. We Left Edmonton at 6.30 am there was not so much as a glass of water offered until 11.30 am. As other reviews have stated it was all about the sale cart and duty free items for sale. I am 5'6" tall average size the seat size was for a child as my legs hung so far over the length of the chair and so uncomfortable I had a sore back on arrival. The plane arrived late into Cuba so arriving late at our resort at 7.15 pm 1 of day short of our 7 day holiday. The return flight left late and after arriving in Edmonton 1 of our luggage didn't arrive. Thanks to WestJet we had our luggage returned 3 days later. We had paid $140 extra for seat selection but the service was no service. I would gladly pack a bagged lunch but remember no food or drinks when entering security. The small bag of cookies was a joke. The staff appeared to be unhappy and the last thing they wanted to do was deal with passengers. Think twice before flying Air Transat.

### Air Transat customer review
I really think that people on this review need to remember this is a charter airline not a luxury airline. My husband and I flew Vancouver - Gatwick recently and went in with charter flight expectations and received exactly that. In fact we were actually pleasantly surprised. The Food was decent but again what is the expectation for $1200 return? Certainly not gourmet. We had frequent beverage services with individual inflight entertainment screens and very pleasant crew. Yes the bistro options were limited but that was absolutely not a concern for me as the food they served free of charge was enough. The mood lighting was a nice feature and the flights were prompt with no baggage concerns. Many people on this review state they will never fly again based on "bad food" or other such complaints. Bring your own food if you are concerned and book the cheaper flight! It was well worth it savings wise.

### Air Transat customer review
Flew YEG to PV Jan 10-17. For a 5 hr flight inflight service atrocious. Terrible $7.50 sandwiches would be over priced if they were free! Coffee was tepid and we were never asked offered a refill. The little cakes could not be classified as food (all preservatives). How difficult can it be to offer edible food and decent beverages for long flights? The flight crew both ways didn't seem to want to be there. It is basically a flying tour bus.The inflight movie offerings are poor. When you pay an additional $60 for your seats ($25 going $35 return) in addition to the fare you expect something.

### Air Transat customer review
Flew from Ottawa to Cancun Mexico and the experience can be summarized as: "sardines in a can" literally not figuratively. I counted approximately 450 people squashed in an area never designed to for such density they call it condensed economy or something of that nature. Never in my life have I been so uncomfortable and I am a medium seized male of average weight. Airline even charges extra if you wish to sit with your spouse/family call it "a bit more for seat selection". Will never fly again. Friends flew very recently to Cancun from Ottawa and have similar experiences. In my opinion it is difficult to envision how such a high person per space density meets any safety standards as in case of an emergency landing it would be very difficult of not impossible to evacuate such a tightly packed/condensed space in any orderly manner. Its all fine and inconsequential until an accident takes place and someone takes an educated look at airlines like this one.

### Air Transat customer review
Disappointed with Air Transat - Toronto to Punta Cana. The aisle is very narrow and the seats recline so far back that the table is too close for comfort. The Bistro menu is limited and a better system should be provided for faster service. It takes a long time for the flight attendant to come by to clear the trays. At the departure gate passengers are put on a bus without any explanation and taken to the plane for boarding.

### Air Transat customer review
I flew from Manchester to Calgary (MAN-YYC). The flight had returned from Calgary however made a stop off in Glasgow. Therefore boarding the flight was much quicker great! The flight was completely full however one passenger decided not to fly at the last minute so the flight was late but this was not a result of Air Transat and the pilot managed to land the plane on time. The service was better then previous years the complementary meals were excellent! However the salad that Air Transat is rather bland and disgusting. The cabin crew were friendly on both flights only complaint is that there could have been more cabin crew smiling at passengers. The seats were comfortable and the head rest can be adjusted to make the seat more comfortable. Inflight entertainment consisted of a variety of music movies and games. Most modern films were available and there's plenty there to keep you entertained at 33000 ft. My luggage made it to and from Canada without any hassle. Great services and plenty of value for the money and what they provide. Definitely recommended Air Transat!

### Air Transat customer review
You cannot check in on line and do seat selection! How ridiculous in 2014. We went to Mexico and couldn't get seats on the way there ahead of time or on the way back. Then at the airport on our return they said our seats were together but in fact we(5) of us were scattered all over the plane. It was like pulling teeth to get water from the stewardess! Only interested in selling product and duty free. That was their focus. I had pop spilled on me on the way there by a stewardess and kicked by another on the way back. A total and utter cluster fuck! Never ever fly with them again! And the flight was late departing and returning. Crazy.

YYZ-GLA-YYZ economy class to GLA and Club back to YYZ. Plane left on time both directions  service was very good and cabin staff did a fine job cabin service was excellent food was ok typical plane food but no worse than any other airline I have flown. I would certainly use them again.

### Air Transat customer review
Very disappointed with the Air Transat reps at Grand Paradise Playa Dorado in Puerto Plata. Our flight TS 1787 was to leave at 4.10 from Puerto Plata. However flight 1786 on Dec 11/14 was delayed until 1.54 pm changing our departure time to 7 pm. I understand the delay in Toronto but I am extremely upset that we sat inside the airport for almost 6 hours. I believe the reps should have been aware that the flight was delayed and should have offered the guests to stay at the resort for those 3 hours versus locked in an airport with no smoking area no communication of the length of delay so we could have waited to go through customs and enjoyed the afternoon sun. Suggest better communication!

First time Air Transat and I was pleased. The option+ for extra leg room food 1 small bottle of sparkling wine a headset and a blanket sheet is worth it for $60 and you know where you will be seated. A330 great plane.

### Air Transat customer review
Toronto to Manchester November 2014 I travel this route once a year there is only Air Transat who do this direct flight so I really have no other choice. These days you have to buy a blanket for $9 (credit card payment only) no bottle water and seat pitch seems limited. They do give you water if you ask but good luck getting their attention I could live without the blanket if they didn't turn the air conditioning down. Lunch was okay I dont expect a gourmet meal so it was as expected but the breakfast was atrocious in the cardboard box was an empty coffee cup an orange juice and a strawberry yoghurt. Air Transat has always been a budget airline and I don't expect much but as bad as the food and service has always been its actually getting worse. On a positive note flight was on time and the plane was clean but give me some competition and I'll be there.

### Air Transat customer review
On the return flight from Toronto to London on 17 October the seating arrangement changed about halfway down the plane from two seats in a row to three seats in a row. The seat was so uncomfortable with not much room to manoeuvre the couple in the next two seats to mine complained too especially as the woman was pregnant. I complained to the stewardess and took a couple of photos to remember the experience. She was sympathetic to my views and agreed that the three in a row seats appeared smaller with less space to stretch out your feet below. In the end it appears that most no frills airlines want to make enough money to make a profit at the expense of the comfort of passengers.

### Air Transat customer review
Flew Business Class from London to Calgary in June this year. As a very nervous flyer I was not really looking forward to the 9.5 hour flight. I needn't have worried. I found the whole experience excellent - especially considering that the flight cost half of what it would have if we had gone with Air Canada. Food was quite good and well presented and the drinks on offer very generous. I have never flown with an airline that offers Grand Marnier as one of the drinks options I was impressed. Staff were helpful and attentive plane left on time and arrived on time. Flight back to London two weeks later was just as good despite being an overnight flight. Although the seats do not go flat they reclined enough to allow me to get some sleep. In-flight entertainment was very good with both new film releases available as well as episodes from some of the more popular TV shows. All in all excellent value for money and as we are hoping to visit Canada next year we will be looking to fly Air Transat.

### Air Transat customer review
London to Toronto in October and returned in November. Chose to travel Club class which is considerably less expensive than other airlines serving the same route so I was completely open minded as to what was being offered. Certainly impressed - the seats were comfortable food tasty and the flight attendants attentive on both flights. Would certainly recommend Air Transat to any one considering a flight to Canada in the near future.

Outbound flight 19th Oct 2014 Manchester to Calgary TS215. Inbound Flight 26th Oct 2014 Calgary to Manchester TS214. First time Flying with Air Transat and we were very impressed with the whole experience from booking the flight to checking in online and the flight from Manchester to Calgary and back again. The staff couldn't do enough for you and I have flown with many airlines around the world and have to say that Air Transat was one of or even the best so far. We shall be booking again in the near future to fly back to Canada and Definitely going with Air Transat again.

### Air Transat customer review
You get what you paid for. Yes I agree that the service is not what the "over-something" age-group expects. But the reason we travel with them is that Air transat flights are cheap. Let's face it I would not be travelling to see loved ones on a regular basis if we did not get these budget flight prices. Yes I agree the service falls apart from there. I agree the food is abysmal. So message to Air Transat is - major on your great flight prices forget the food (don't even offer it within the price - please do not insult us with an inferior product). Instead recommend to passengers that they take their own food (I did on my return journey and I was really glad) or offer a paid-for on-board food service of quality which passengers could purchase ("quality" being the operative here). That way you make money on the food and you can also cut back on the cost of Cabin Service (including personnel because there would be no need for so many staff). Then apply these savings to even better flight prices!

I flew to and from London Gatwick from Toronto Pearson returning home yesterday. Both flights were comfortable smooth with good service. I will definitely fly with Air Transat again. I was on the October 17th flight leaving Gatwick at noon and there was an elderly woman who required extra care. The flight attendants were wonderful very patient and extremely helpful. They moved her to a seat right beside a washroom checked on her repeatedly. I am very impressed.

### Air Transat customer review
My wife and I returned from our first cruise. We selected Air Transat and Marlin travel as we have booked through them before. We left Oct 11 and returned Oct 18 from YYZ to FLL as bad luck would have it the same plane reg number 802 both ways. I anticipated that since AT had just received the 737-800 fleet they would be in good shape. Never assume. I was seated in 3a and seat 2a was missing the cover plate for the left arm rest exposing the wires and mechanical system. This area was also dirty. Above 2h there was a large piece of trim which was loose between the bins and the wall. Watching the attendants they struggled to operate the cabin lights and overhead entertainment machine. Now the worst. The forward toilet seat was broken in half left side which I reported to the attendants. On the way home the seat was taped together with what appeared to be white medical tape. The entertainment system movie was not working and both trim pieces in the same shape. No seat belt trays up or seat back up inspection from the attendants either taking off or landing. Terrible plane and disappointment. I am not a perfectionist but do appreciate a clean well maintained plane. Fly another carrier.

### Air Transat customer review
Flew to Paris in business as AC was asking an outrageous amount. Took the last flight out on Saturday night. The boarding was easy enough settled in the seats but they were hard as rocks. There was no attendant and I was served 1/2 a sandwich. On the return I was stuck near the window. Impossible to get out of that seat. I had to bother the passenger next to me. The plane was unbelievable hot because it sat on the tarmac and many were complaining about the lack of air-conditioning. I have now decided not to fly unless absolutely necessary and never with Air Transat.

Flew Manchester to Calgary and Vancouver to Manchester everything from initial enquiry to returning back to Manchester was first class we flew club class plenty of room very good food for an airline and more than enough to drink. Also very good value.

### Air Transat customer review
In the past 2 years I have travelled with Air Transat 26 times. In the early days I would buy an upgrade to club at the check in and at £100 pounds or so it was well worth the better seat comfort which was my main concern. The food and beverage is way above the economy standard. These days I only book economy as the rate for club is much more (£300) plus and you are not immune from the frequent screaming brat brigade behind the curtain. Now I take pot luck and get my seat allocated at the check in. I don't think I have ever been on a flight that has left on time - always 30 mins plus late as a minimum and on one occasion we left over 2 hours late! No apology coming from the crew and some missed the ongoing connections. To be fair the staff have been overall good given the standard of some of the passengers expectations. So why do I keep using Air Transat? Simple they are the cheapest and Gatwick is much better than getting round to hideous Heathrow. My advice for what it worth is if you can manage 7 hours get fed and watered before you go. Expect screaming kids and if you are lucky you will be far enough away not to worry about and in any case get some noise cancelling headphones they help a bit! Check out the cost of club over econ and to be honest it just don't add up. Personally I wish they would give decent seats no food and water/drinks available at a cost and I would gladly pay an extra amount for that. Like the man says you get what you pay for I guess?

### Air Transat customer review
I paid an extra £59 each way to Toronto for extra leg room. It certainly was not worth the extra money for the seats I had the food wasn't worth eating I would not travel on Air Transat again. I feel I wasted the extra money on the extra leg room seats.

Flew to Vancouver Flight TS777. 6 October 2014. Awful hot flight. AC not working for a few flights. Food was horrible especially the inedible 'pizza'. Seats were very uncomfortable. Tickets were around £1200 for 2 so not that cheap to merit extremely hot long haul trip with broken AC and awful food and rigid seats.

### Air Transat customer review
Flew from Toronto to Dublin and was very disappointed. The flight was overnight and for 5 of the 6 hour flight the fluorescent lights were left on making sleep nearly impossible. I booked the flight direct and they decided last minute to stop over in Montreal and pick up more passengers. Meaning from the time I boarded in Toronto I waited about 3 hours before I was served a lukewarm dinner which barely passed as edible. The flight crew were very nice however served extremely slow. My finished dinner was sitting in front of me for about 45 minutes before someone took it away. The plane itself was also not something I would pay for. The seats were extremely small (the smallest seats I have ever been on) and the aisles were so narrow I hit elbows the whole way down to the one of two washrooms onboard. Overall I was extremely dissatisfied with the experience. There's a reason the tickets are so cheap. I would definitely pay the extra in order to not have to fly with them again.

We flew with Air Transat MAN to YVR on 26 Sep returning 04 Oct in Club Class. From check-in at Manchester to disembarkation at Manchester 9 days later the service can not be faulted in anyway. We were made to feel special at all times. Pre take off drinks salad starter main course dessert cheese and warm bread Good wine choice. Their speciality coffee was a good touch. A large mug of coffee containing Grand Marnier and Baileys and cream on top. Yummy snack before landing at Vancouver. Very comprehensive IFE. Plenty of films tv shows etc. Return service the same. The seat was comfortable for a long flight. This was excellent value and service for a leisure airline. Our bags came off the plane first at both ends Well worth paying the extra.

September 26th 2014 - Manchester to Vancouver October 4th 2014 - Vancouver to Manchester. Booked over 12 months in advance directly with very friendly telephone agent in Montreal and got Club Class for a great price. Both flights on Airbus A330 with no itinerary changes. Very speedy check-in at Manchester with 'fast-lane' security included. Flight on time to the minute and as we were club passengers we boarded first. Greeted onboard by the staff and immediately offered us drinks and explained the workings of the seat and entertainment system. Legroom is more than comfortable and seats had a good recline. We were then given complimentary comfort packs headphones and amenity packs. After takeoff we were offered unlimited drinks before being served delicious meals served on china and tablecloths liqueurs after dinner and even came round with speciality coffee. Further snacks and drinks followed until we landed at Vancouver and our 'priority' luggage was delivered immediately. Similar service on the return flight and very organized hassle-free check in at Vancouver - again with 'fastlane' security. Plenty of drinks snacks hot-towels newspapers and a delicious Chicken dish served beautifully. After a relaxing flight a continental breakfast was served with fresh coffee juice and tea. We arrived at Manchester 20 minutes early. Air Transat offer a great Club Class experience for an amazing price. Seat comfort is probably not what you'll find in some other business class airlines but the clean cabin mood lighting relaxed atmosphere and very attentive service is exceptional. They only have 12 Club seats on a 345 seat aircraft so book early do avoid disappointment!

### Air Transat customer review
Have travelled several times with this airline - food leaves a lot to be desired. Seated next to a young child maybe 2-3 years old who for the duration of the flight never stopped screaming - I know this is not the fault of the airline but this is not the first time I have had to endure this flying with this airline. Having said that I will still continue to fly with Air Transat but please make an effort to improve the inflight food even if it makes the cost of flying a bit more.

### Air Transat customer review
Certainly a real mixed bag when it comes to offering my opinion on Air Transat. Okay let's start with the good we paid the additional fee for the "Option Plus" and it provided us with what they said it would. Priority check in seat selection priority baggage handling and a few extras on board. For the round trip ticket (Vancouver to Glasgow) the price was better than the two big guys (Air Canada and British Airways). Flight both ways right on time and although we had an hour stop in Calgary at least we flew into Glasgow and avoided the "Heathrow nightmare" and believe me avoiding Heathrow was an absolute bonus. Seats were reasonably comfortable lovely mood lighting and a fairly good personal entertainment system. Service by the cabin crew was good on the round trip so all in all I would say the flight was quite satisfactory. Now the bad the food that was served was simply awful and I have no doubt the fight attendants knew that. I've made numerous trips back to the UK in the past 45 years and I honestly can't recall airline food being as bad as what Air Transat served on this flight. It really defies logic in my humble opinion as to why they couldn't add an additional ten to twenty dollars on a ticket and provide passengers with a reasonably quality meal. Ten hours on a flight to the U.K. so yes food is going to be served but really this food was simply terrible if they served food like that in the prison system they would have mass riots to deal with!

### Air Transat customer review
Vancouver to London. I booked my (direct) flights way in advance only to be told two weeks before my trip that my return flight was now stopping on the way. After many emails asking to be put on another flight any other day and being told that there was nothing available I noticed my flight was still being advertised as direct a week after they had changed it. After another email stating that they were false advertising magically they found me another seat on a flight the next morning. The food is rubbish and not enough of it only one meal on a 10 hour flight also the exact same as the outbound flight no option to even purchase anything except pringles or crisps. The wine - I'm not sure where they get the stuff they serve with the meal but it is absolutely the worst after that you have to pay a premium if you want another drink. I don't get it how much could it cost to have a couple bottles of wine vodka and beer on hand to give to the passengers? The service is mixed some of the check in staff I have encountered have been amazing making calls to get me better seats and others have been very rude. Flight attendants are mostly nice and some exceptional. The entertainment is a great new system that has worked quite well for all but one of my flights. They have some new movies but they dont seem to change them very often most of the TV series were the same as they were a year ago. All in all I wont fly them again and I wont recommend them they just kind of feel cheap like your flying a short domestic flight where it doesn't really matter.

### Air Transat customer review
We travelled London to Calgary and Vancouver to London - never again! They have squeezed 9 seats per row into an aircraft designed for 8 seats per row. This results in a seat 16.5 wide though I believe they claim it to be 16.7. Consequently the seats are appallingly uncomfortable and in my case resulted in severe back pain following both flights. In addition the food was disgusting and I didn't eat very much of it choosing instead to go without. There were insufficient pasta meals meaning that by the time we were served there was no choice. It was take the meat meal or go without. The breakfast served was indescribable. On the flight out we complained several times about the air conditioning which was set too high. The cabin was very cold and passengers were adding jumpers and even coats in order to try to be comfortable. Our requests to turn the air conditioning down a little were ignored and we were seated in a freezing flow of air the whole flight (we were sitting in central aisle seats - avoid). The return journey was a little better as we wore several layers of clothing and booked side seats which were not as much in the flow of cold air. We paid £9 to book our seats I see that now they have increased the price to £13.

### Air Transat customer review
YUL-ATH-YUL with an Airbus A330 on both legs. I've flown and rated this airline a few months before and this time it was a bit better. The check in process in Montreal and Athens airport went smooth. The seat comfort was good on the inbound because it was the emergency exit row and for the return leg it was fine I was flying on stand by so no complaints. The service and the crew onboard was fine nothing special and the meals were not the best. On the return leg there was an unscheduled stop in Shannon for refuelling (probably because of the weight restrictions) and we were informed when we were onboard. Entertainment was good with a screen on each seat despite it sometimes pausing - the movie selection was the same on both legs. Overall I think this airline is overrated but it's not too bad and it offers a better product and service than the other airlines on the same route.

Manchester MAN to Toronto YYZ and return on Airbus A310. By booking early for our Canada holiday I was able to secure Club Class seats at not much more than the scheduled economy fare and what a good deal that was. Comfortable seats with plenty of legroom in a 12 seat cabin pleasant and attentive FA's and as much food and drink as we wanted served with real crockery and cutlery. The ground procedures at Manchester need an overhaul though. Check-in and bag drop only open at the prescribed time and then they insist on checking and tagging cabin bags (which are never inspected again so why they have to be tagged is a mystery) all of which makes the online check-in facility superfluous. This was not the case at Toronto so why is it needed at Manchester? There was less service from FA's on the return flight although this did give passengers the opportunity to sleep which would have been easier had not the FA's been constantly chattering in the galley area or tearing up and down the aisles! Most of the complaints about Air Transat seem to come from economy class passengers but both our flights were full which says something.

### Air Transat customer review
Travelled from Toronto to London Gatwick on my first flight with Air Transat. I was leery because of the significantly lower price to other airlines but thought I would take a chance. What a surprise! Saved about 30% and the plane and service was excellent. It was well worth paying the additional money for a seat with more leg room if you are a tall person like me.

### Air Transat customer review
Travelled with my spouse on August 23/14 to Paris and then returned to Toronto on TS 0489 on Sept 12/14. The flights left on time and seats were comfortable however the $300 additional charged for Option Plus is over the top. On the trip to Paris we noticed that only one other seat was designated Option Plus. We noticed a few things that didn't make much sense to us. If we hadn't booked Option Plus we could have still booked two similar seats at no additional cost and wouldn't have received the Comfort Package ($9) and one free small bottle of sparkling wine and small bottle of wine with our dinner. We arrived at the airport 2 hours in advance both leaving and returning and never had to wait in line so no big advantage here. In terms of our Priority Tags on our bags one bag in Paris took close to 20 minutes to arrive after receiving the first bag so again where is the value for money. On the trip to Paris we were asked if we could have wine instead of sparkling wine (why are customers not given that option). We noticed as well that the food cart went by us at least two times and when we were finally served whatever options the other economy passengers had were taken away from us-we were served leftovers. I suppose on a busy flight with many Option Plus passengers the issue of time would be taken into consideration (this was not our situation). This was our first trip with Air Transat. We travel to Mexico each winter. On the trip home to Toronto I discussed the situation regarding wine selection and timing of meal services with two flight attendants (very cordial) however they were simply following company policy. I should point out that I think we were the only ones with Option Plus. Again we asked for wine instead of sparkling wine and were accommodated (good) however the leftover meal was for a child not an adult-again why wouldn't we be served the same time as the folks in the front of the aircraft. Our bags were first-off in Toronto (good).

### Air Transat customer review
Toronto-Paris and Amsterdam-Toronto for a group of 4. I was able to check-in online for the Toronto-Paris flight but there was no option to check-in online at Amsterdam. When we got to Paris we had use buses to get to the terminal which were very crowed. The flight was very small and tight. They designed the seats to fit 9 in each row on a A310. Even the attendants were having a hard time pushing the cart through the isles. Ensure to bring your own headphones pillows and blanket as they are not provided. They charge $9CAD for them. The food was just horrible with no flavor at all. Bring your own meal. Definitely as budget airline but definitely not worth the price they charge. It'll be worth the extra money to book with a national carrier.

### Air Transat customer review
Gatwick to Toronto 2/09/2014 and return from Montreal 8/09/2014. Both flights were on one of the new Airbus aircraft and both flights were not an enjoyable experience on the way out there were screaming children for a total of 7.5 hours and on the way back we had the dread of all air travellers 2 young children in the seats behind who spent nearly all of the 6.5 hours shouting screaming and banging the back of our seats. Apart from all of that the aircraft seats are fairly comfortable  the aisle between the rows of seats seems very narrow which does not lend itself to having a stroll around to stretch legs. The service is very mediocre and the food on both flights left a lot to be desired. Odd to find that any goods could only be purchased on board by credit card charged in Canadian dollars and not cash.

TS 429 from CDG Paris on August 28th 12.55 pm to YVR Vancouver BC. You get what you pay for. Cheaper tickets mean rude check in staff dismissive service on board not treated very well by staff members. That about says it all. One word of warning - be prepared to try to stuff your carry on baggage into the size control check apparatus in Paris CDG. I will never again use this company if paying a little more money means people will be treated with respect then Lufthansa will get my business.

I flew on 29th of July and again on the 28th of August the first flight being TS541 from London to Calgary was really good with no issues the Air Transat staff in London Gatwick airport were nice and helped me out a lot. The crew on the flight was pretty much the same very nice and very helpful at the end of that flight the crew helped me get my bag out of the overhead compartment without me asking which was very professional. On the flight back it was a different story the staff in Calgary Airport were not helpful at all. Other than that it was a good flight. The new cabins are excellent but the only flaw is that if you tilt the screen up the person in front of you is fully reclined the screen has a mind of its own the system randomly thinks you touched it. They need to fix it because this happened on both flights with different aircraft.

### Air Transat customer review
We flew direct from Vancouver to Paris and back. An excellent experience all around. Air Transat delivered great value for a very competitive fare. Flights departed on time and arrived early. Service was friendly professional and responsive. Cabins were clean and comfortable. We purchased the Option Plus package and would definitely do so again. The combination of seat selection priority check-in priority boarding extra weight allowance free drinks and snacks and comfort kit was worth the extra fee. We will certainly be travelling with Air Transat again soon.

August 15 Flight 660 to Punta Cana. Return Aug 22 Flight 661. I think it is great that Air Transat staff now has more time to sell their Duty Free products and collect for charity since they don't have to do much else oh I forgot the drink and 7 little cookies. Both coming and going TV/Movie monitor didn't work properly (different planes). I think I paid the same (I even upgraded) that everyone else does for a decent monitor. 350 people for two bathrooms in the back and one in middle that only people in that aisle used. Certainly not very customer service friendly.

Just flew Vancouver to Gatwick and return seats are very tiny cramped and almost no padding the food was nearly inedible. The crew however was great very friendly. I really would encourage the airline to upgrade the seats a little and do something about the food!

Flight TS296 Vancouver to Glasgow 17/6/14. One long queue Vancouver Airport for check in for several Air Transat flights very slow moving and chaotic. Very disappointed with cabin service during flight. Breakfast served frozen so inedible prior to landing Glasgow. Written complaint form completed and handed to Flight Director.

I flew from Toronto to Dublin on July 31 on the A310 aircraft. The aircraft is cramped and only has the shared screens. Having said that the service on board was excellent. On my return flight on August 19 I was on board the A330. I also upgraded to Options Plus for the return flight. It is a much roomier plane with the individual screens. The service on the return trip was once again excellent. Air Transat has come along way and as a regular flyer their service can't be beat.

### Air Transat customer review
After we booked our flights from Manchester to Toronto we read the on-line reviews many of which were extremely negative. So it was with much trepidation we began our journey to Canada late May returning mid July. However our experience was positive particularly on the homeward journey when we travelled on one of the newer airlines the seats were comfy we didn't feel too confined and there was nice soothing lighting system. We found the airline staff to be very efficient and helpful so no problem there. The food was ok but we could live with that having saved about £300 each flying with Air Transat. So all in all we were pleasantly surprised by our experiences.

Flew from Calgary back to Vancouver in August was pleased with the service plane tickets were cheap the flight was on time and the children got a special package at the end of the flight. Would definitely use them again.

Gatwick to Toronto TS 623 10th August 2014. Last year we were told that by this year we could expect an aircraft with the redesigned cabins and we're disappointed to find it was the old configuration with not so comfortable seats and no choice in the movies provided. It' s highly likely I would have scored a 10 otherwise. The service from the cabin staff was excellent and there were more beverages offered than we could drink. The meals were excellent - the best I'd ever tasted on an airline and overall it was a very pleasant experience. We had priority baggage but through no fault of Air Transat it was a waste of time as it took an hour to get through customs and immigration so everyone's bags were at baggage reclaim by the time we got there. I wouldn't hesitate to book Air Transat Club again and I'm hoping that on the return flight we will get the new cabins.

### Air Transat customer review
We purchased the Option Plus. That put us in a different line for check in which in the end was not special. It allows for an extra checked bag for each person. On the plane it gets you a comfort kit: blanket eye mask and blow up neck pillow. Sadly they smell like plastic which was ok after being aired out for a week. Leaving from Montreal the airplane did not allow us to control our own air conditioning. 8 hours of flight while being hot and jammed in like a sardine was not great. Each of our seats had a TV screen and our choice of movies and TV shows to watch. The connection for headphones for my son and I was not good and we had to hold the plug in place to hear. The staff were pleasant and helpful on the way out. The way back from Rome was terrible. We thought we had learned from the way over and dressed in cool clothing. This time there was a/c we could control. But the screen was in the center of the plane and you could watch the movie they chose. It took me more than half way through the 9 hour flight to figure out how to get the sound to work. They did have Wi-Fi which helped take away some of the boredom for my son but the battery on my laptop gave out. The staff were rude and dismissive. On the trip back we had to change our tickets returning earlier than the 2 months we had planned. I fully expected to pay a change fee but I was told that can't be done and I would have to purchase new tickets. While shocked by this I bought them hoping that once I got home I could write to customer service and get some help. When checking in our bags I asked if we could please use the Option Plus that was paid for round trip on our first flight to cover the one extra bag we needed to check. I was told no. The guy behind the counter even begged of the supervisor since when he weighed all three bags we were still well under our weight limit. Still she refused and I had to pay over one hundred dollars for the extra bag.

### Air Transat customer review
I recently flew Air Transat from Rome to Toronto. I was seated in a row quite near the washrooms. The washrooms were in constant use throughout the flight. At a point halfway through the flight a flight attendant replaced toilet tissue and kleenex. Other than that there was no attempt to clean the washrooms. At one point a father with a young son stood in the open washroom door and cleaned the toilet so that his child could use it. The washrooms became stinky as the flight went on. The passengers in the row ahead of me who were directly across from the washrooms were constantly reaching out from their seats to close the washroom door that was left open. All in all the whole experience was disgusting. Other public facilities with washrooms post a sheet on the inside door and staff are required to check off cleaning duties every hour. How can you expect a cubicle toilet to remain clean over a 9 hour flight when it is in constant use. I expect a clean washroom on my flights. Air Transat offers perks like inflight shopping wine and beverage service etc. Surely they could offer clean washroom facilities as a priority.

Booked a trip Glasgow - Calgary and chose business option. Flight out went through Manchester there was not as much of a delay as we thought. Added about 90 mins to outward journey. Service wonderful food excellent. On time both ways.

### Air Transat customer review
Toronto to Faro 11 Feb. Faro to Toronto 26 Mar. Our options were a non-stop flight with Air Transat or a three leg flight (Toronto-Munich-Lisbon-Faro) with Air Canada. Air Transat cost about $300 each more than AC for economy class. Its planes are all more than 20 years old and this route uses the original seating mainly 3-3-3 in a plane designed for 2-4-2. Leg room is less than AC and seat width much tighter. Food was the worst we have had seen since flying American to California. On the return flight the attendants repeatedly walked the aisles imploring passengers to take the inedible mini-pizzas! YYZ-FAO: arrived early and were invited by the friendly agent to switch from row 28 to bulkhead seats! We chose right side which has half curtains rather than a fixed bulkhead and I was able to stretch my legs out in front of me (I'm 183 cm mainly legs) no extra charge! Unfortunately the 3-3-3 seating does not give enough room for the food carts to pass the fixed bulkhead without slamming them repeatedly against it and forcing through an exercise which was repeated throughout the flight and drove our aisle passenger to find another seat after a few episodes. Overhead screen was directly above our heads so we were unable to see anything. Five music channels with volume settings too low to hear or too high to listen bring your own entertainment. Two rear and one mid cabin toilet for about 240 people is way below what is needed on 6-8 hour flights. Cabin crew were efficient but not overly communicative and not very visible after the meal service was over. The flight left about 20 minutes late but arrived almost one hour early so we had to wait for Ryanair to vacate an arrivals slot at FAO. Return flight was almost 2 hours longer in row 26 middle a claustrophobic experience when the seats in front were slammed back for sleeping. The small overhead screens were showing an animated feature to an audience of snowbirds averaging probably 65years old great program planning. Overhead storage is very limited and too many passengers are permitted to bring oversized luggage causing much frustration for later arrivals. Overall these out-dated aircraft need to be replaced with modern equipment for overseas flights but apparently the once a week flights to Portugal have no competitors so Air Transat can charge higher prices for less comfort and an inferior flight experience.

### Air Transat customer review
I flew with Air Transat for the first time with my husband and 11 month old last month. We flew directly to Rome. We were travelling option plus both ways and with option plus you get free headphones priority check in and blankets on the flight. Going to Rome from Canada I had received the privileges and the service wasn't that bad. However on our way back we were delayed for 3.5 hours 1 of which was inside the bus in the heat with no air conditioning. Then 2.5 hours on the plane. The hostesses were ignorant and rude and when I asked for the complementary blankets she said I should have kept the ones from the first trip even though I had paid for option plus both ways. She gave us a this dirty used blanket to cover my son who was cold in the bassinet. A few hours later when I asked for a glass of water she asked me why I missed the "bar call" and I had to explain why I was in the toilet changing my son. Once we got to Toronto they refused to give me the stroller that I checked in at the gate and told me to get it with my baggage! They got me a loan stroller that had broken wheels and I had to take my son off of it and carry him through customs etc. If I wanted to receive my stroller with the luggage I would have checked it in and not have it "gate checked" the whole point is to receive it as soon as you arrive. I will never fly Air Transat again.

Air Transat - Vancouver to Gatwick Club Class 31/07/14 - club class cost us an extra £300 per seat but came with additional benefits. The dedicated check in at Vancouver meant that check in only took 5 minutes. We were first on the plane. The seats were wider and deeper with good leg room and reclining ability. We got a complimentary blanket neck cushion earphones eye mask toothpaste and brush and slippers. We also got champagne as much alcohol as we wanted. The meal was of a much better quality than in economy with proper cutlery. The entertainment system was the same as economy but we had a remote control as well. Our luggage came out first and all together as it was labelled priority which was very nice. The flight was on time and arrived early. It only took 30 minutes from getting off the plane to getting through customs with our luggage. Air Transat were at least as good as BA Air Canada and Virgin but much cheaper. Was club class worth and extra £300 possibly not. I would probably pay an extra £150 but you can also take on much more luggage than economy which could make it worth the extra payment.

My husband and I booked a flight with Transat in June for Barcelona from Montreal in their Club Class. The night before departure we were bumped down to economy class. I had reserved months in advance and only for Club. Because of our distress Air Transat booked us on Option Plus class and gave us 4 seats across for added comfort. They also refunded us half of each ticket plus gift certificates for future travel. The new refurbished flights were wonderful both in Options Plus and in Club with roomy seats luxuriously long seatbelts and pampering from the flight attendants. Champagne great food wine and steady stream of special snacks and the movies were all up to date. We arrived early. Our experience with Transat was fabulous.

Travelled to Vancouver on July 5th. I was very impressed with the service. We received very helpful guidance from the minute we stepped inside Manchester airport. Immediately a greeter showed us which queue to go in and gave us simple steps to follow. The staff at every level were very good and helpful. I haven't done transatlantic for 20 years but I found the experience very easy and efficient. I couldn't recommend Transat any more!

### Air Transat customer review
I debated whether to book Air Canada or Air Transat to fly from LGW-YVR. Air Canada has made it tougher to get miles and upgrades and introduced a high-density aircraft on the London-Vancouver route. I decided to change it and take Air Transat from Gatwick to Calgary (was half the price of the Vancouver flight) and picked up a local connection from Calgary to Vancouver. Air Transat vs Air Canada. Although there was more leg room and a new plane I would not fly Air Transat again! 1) The toilets did not flush properly and there was a back log of used toilet paper stuck in the toilet. No one bothered to clean them. 2) The movies were out of date. Dated back to 1990's. They did not play any new releases. Basically there was nothing to watch. 3) You had to pay for blankets and pillows snacks and alcoholic beverages. 4) The fire exit seats were by the toilets and the poor passengers were freezing. The pax sitting in the middle aisle of the fire exist seat only had one screen to watch a movie. The seat of three had only one screen in the middle. 5) The food on the plane was not better than AC. 6) The duty free was rubbish. 7) All stewardess were sitting in a row of seats at the back. Sitting and chatting and when I asked them for a duty free product they couldn't even stand up and help. They said that the duty free would come through the aircraft just before landing.

Toronto-Montego Bay in Club Class. Checked in online only carry on bags arrived at airport only to be told to check in again so they know we are here-very silly. Boarding process very disorganized but still managed an early departure. On board seats 2H 2K welcome drink and headsets. Decent meal that we had pre-selected. Excellent service lots of drink refills without being asked. Return flight July 27 was the exact opposite. Honeymooners were upgraded to Club Class at the last minute causing confusion. Had to ask for headsets only 1 FA serving not the 2 as advertised. Again decent meal had to ask for drinks and refills none offered. Well worth the extra cost for the first flight not so much for the return.

### Air Transat customer review
Flew MAN to YVR in May 14 had flown same route in May 13 and June 11 all times in Club. Have to say for the price it was great. This year we were in row 1 for both legs and these are great seats but they need footrests or footstools. It was a brand new cabin new mood lighting but the service was cheerful and the drinks and snacks constant. Only problem was with trying to pre-book meals on both legs and finally gave up only to be offered what was left on the actual flight but it was good enough. The prices are creeping up. Have flown Club with them in old config and it was fine now with only 12 seats it has pushed up the price quite a bit. Still worth the money for early boarding disembarkation drinks and snacks and peace and quiet in a really small cabin. A real negative though is now in July 14 you can book flights for next year but no seat maps are open. Wonder what is going on there. I am not paying over£1k for a seat I can't choose.

Had Air Transat flight to Toronto on 11th June and returned Halifax to Gatwick on 9th July 2014. Both flights were great and leg room was more than expected. Food was not bad for Airline food. We loved Halifax Airport but were not impressed with the bag drop at Air Transit. The staff weighed the luggage then we had to take a card over the bag drop scan it and the bags should then go through which they didn't! Then had to do it all again. Appeared to work second time round but we had checked in 2 bags but only 1 bag arrived at Gatwick! Still waiting to hear 24 hours later!

### Air Transat customer review
Had an enjoyable and comfortable flight from Toronto to Rome Fiumicino. Flight was on time and arrived in Rome 40 minutes early. Aircraft was clean staff were courteous and food was as good as airline food gets. Inflight (inseat) entertainment was better than most I have seen. Several updates from flight deck including pilot pointing out crossing the alps (stupendous views from the air). The only complaint I have was that the lights were not turned off during flight despite it being an overnight flight.

### Air Transat customer review
From booking with 'Canadian affair' to collecting our luggage on the return flight we were really pleased with Air Transat. Our YYC-LGW return itinerary went almost entirely without flaw. The ticket price for our itinerary saved my spouse and I an excess of $1000 over booking with KLM or Air Canada. We booked our seats in advance (21A & 21B on both flights at $20/seat/flight) and then utilized Transat's new online check-in. The online service was simple and easy to use with a dedicated bag drop and next to no line-up as a result. Our flights were both on refurbished A330-200 Twin engine Wide-body jets. The 9 across configuration Air Transat uses (over the typical 8 on most A330s) was noticeably tight but not impossible or overly uncomfortable and on the outbound flight we lucked out having the block of 3 to ourselves. Mood lighting on both flights was neat to watch and I actually agree that it made a difference in the overall perception of time and minimization of Jet Lag. The two airplanes had differing overhead bin designs the outbound being Airbus's new style curvy bins and the return being their older style. Although this doesn't seem like something the average person would care about the difference determined whether or not the seat had an overhead personal air vent. Only the older style bin aircraft was supplied with this feature - one I hate seeing airlines remove. It made the return flight all the more comfortable to have a little blast of cool air. Legroom on both aircraft was the same and is slightly above the norm I'd say somewhere around 33" pitch. Transat's new inflight entertainment on the A330's is a great system with plenty of newer mainstream movies TV shows and music to choose from. Even the food onboard was good. On the return the food was more of "microwave dinner" calibre - each of us ordering 'orange chicken' but perfectly edible and of good enough taste. They are small though so consider packing a snack or taking advantage of their onboard purchase menu. Upon arrival of both of our "on time" flights our bags were delivered in good time even though we did not pay extra for Option Plus or priority baggage services offered. Overall we were incredibly pleased with the Transat Experience after reading some less than satisfactory reviews - and would absolutely fly with this airline (and to this surprisingly easy to access and navigate airport) again.

### Air Transat customer review
My husband and I flew Air Transat last week from Montreal to Paris and I must say everything was perfect. Service was excellent the crew really did everything they could to please us. The entertainment system is brand new and has lots of movies TV shows games and music albums. The aircraft seemed to be brand new and was really nice. The food was good I mean airplane food is airplane food but it was really good compared to what I had on other airlines. Do not worry about the negative comments I'm a frequent flyer on lots of different airlines and I will be flying Air Transat more often because I have absolutely nothing negative to say.

Travelled with Air Transat Gatwick - Halifax and return on the 11th June and 25th June. On the outward flight we had a slight delay from Gatwick (nothing new) but made up time and arrived early after a very pleasant flight. On the return to Gatwick we took a few minutes early and arrived half an hour before our due landing time. I do not know if the cabin crew at Air Transat have been on a customer care course since I last traveled with Air Transat two years ago but there standard of care was first class on both flights. The only downside was the food but then airline food is a joke unless you pay top dollar for your flight. One new item on the return flight was the availability of Internet connection. Alas I could not get Google Chrome to download the app onto my Android tablet. It was my fault not being an IT person not Air Transats. All in all well done Air Transat.

### Air Transat customer review
Travelled to Toronto with this airline three weeks ago. Check in good and efficient as was security check etc. On board all nice and clean and bright. Flight on time. Seat back TV's good with a selection of films TV shows etc to watch. It was a very smooth flight and the service of food and drinks was very efficient. On arrival in Toronto we had to wait for over one hour for our luggage to arrive. A bad end to a near perfect flight. Our journey home from Toronto was almost the complete opposite. On arriving at the airport we found the longest queue ever for the Air Transat flight. There were no supervisors about to speak to. Seven flights were all queuing for the same five check in desks. We had to stand in this queue for one hour and twenty minutes. With approx 50 people still in front of us two supervisors arrived and shouted for passengers travelling to Manchester to come forward. The plane was obviously a lot older than the one we arrived on. The TV s were in the middle. We had paid £20 extra each for our seats. These were near the rear of the plane and there were only two seats not three as elsewhere. Apart from that were no different. We had the usual inconsiderate passengers in front of us who reclined their seats as far back as possible so we had minimal room. Do not bother to pay this extra. It is not worth it. The food was average. The drinks were plentiful and free. The flight was smooth and baggage claim at Manchester reasonable.

We flew to Vancouver from Manchester in May with Air Transat. They were on time both ways the aircraft was clean and very bright the staff were great nothing was too much trouble. As airline food goes theirs was very good the movies were up to date all in all a great flight. We have used Transat a few times they really seem to have their act together well done.

Took more than 1.15 hrs for luggage to be delivered to carousel #9 at YYZ. After flight 333 from Dublin on Saturday June 21. No supervisor on duty. CARD on that level had just come on duty. Previous one left her post early. This one said there were too many planes and not enough staff. Would not let me speak to person on other end of her phone. Many passengers very upset. Very bad service with no supervisor. There is no excuse for this.

Flew from London Gatwick to Vancouver and returned Calgary to Gatwick. We could not find fault at all with any part of the whole experience. Aircraft looked new Airbus 330's great inflight entertainment comfortable leather seats and plenty of leg room (I'm 6ft 1in). The airline staff are friendly and the meals were as good as any that you get in economy and better than most. We had some quite severe turbulence on the way back which the pilot warned us about and took time to explain it was all routine and no more than bumps in the road nice touch. I will use Air Transat as my first choice airline if they cover any of the routes I need to fly.

My wife and I went from YVR to GLA on 6 May 2014. We purchased options plus and I must say it was fantastic I would purchase it again. However on the return flight it was non existent everything great until we boarded the aircraft the service all stopped when I asked for a scotch - I was told it was $6.50. I said I had options plus and I was told not to cause a disturbance. I repeated myself again and was told the same. We were treated the same as the other passengers.

I travelled with Air Transat from GLA-YYZ in May. Fantastic service and preferred the direct flight rather than connecting flights. Inflight entertainment was good and had two feature films to watch onboard. Friendly staff at check-in and onboard. I had the option plus and would book that again as I didn't have to spend any money onboard. Ill definitely fly Air Transat again. Highly recommended.

### Air Transat customer review
MAN-YYZ-MAN. Outbound flight to Toronto just under 7 hours on an A-310. Narrow seats and inflight entertainment old fashioned screens down the middle of the aircraft. Crew friendly and efficient. Food good. Nothing from the flight deck whilst airborne. Returning on an A-330 in 6 hours 40 minutes inflight entertainment excellent in terms of films and TV. Yet again crew friendly and efficient. Food not as good but it's through the night so not as bothered. Again no flight deck announcements whilst in the air. Seats narrow but we had three seats to the two of us so effect minimised. Person in front reclined making viewing of seat back TV difficult. It's about time all airlines did away with reclining seats. Soft drinks free alcohol has to be bought but it's quite reasonable price wise.

### Air Transat customer review
Flew Air Transat first time 5 June from Calgary to London Gatwick as only airline with direct flight. Check in was delayed 25 minutes as they seemed incapable of checking in more than one flight at a time and they were 2 passengers missing for the earlier Paris flight. This resulted in a huge queue at check in. Luckily we were there early and joined the queue as soon as the flight number showed on the board. Others weren't as lucky. As it was a night flight of 8.5 hrs was expecting pillows and blanket on seats. Nothing. I found I didn't need them anyway as any chance of catching a few zzzz was impossible as they didn't turn down the cabin lighting until after 5 hours into the flight and then only for an hour. They only used one drinks and food trolley per aisle so it took forever to first get a drink and then be served a pretty awful meal as we were near the back of the aircraft. My friend sitting behind me was left with a choice of pasta or pasta. When she said she didn't like pasta they offered her macaroni cheese as an alternative! At the point where they could have turned the lighting down they didn't and then announced the duty free trolley was on its way. Breakfast was a sad affair of partially frozen fruit salad and orange juice. Only good thing was we arrived at Gatwick 20 minutes early. Overall a very poor experience and one I hope never to repeat.

### Air Transat customer review
My husband and I purchased the Options Plus for a trip from Vancouver to Cancun. The outbound trip was uneventful and we had an excellent vacation. It was only when we returned home that it all fell apart. Our seat selection (part of the options plus package) was not available and no explanation provided. Our meal service although the Options Plus assured us a priority selection did not occur. We actually did not get any meals until we corralled 5 of the flight attendants none of whom believed us that we had not received a meal. It was only when the original flight attendant confirmed that we had not had a meal did they believe us although I am not certain as to why Air Transat employees thought I would attempt to obtain two meals. I was advised that the "other side screwed up". I am not certain as to why I needed to have that piece of information however my "choice of meal" was now the children's chicken nuggets as that was all that was left. When we arrived our luggage although clearly marked priority was the last to arrive on the carousel. Not an indication of priority handling. When I complained to Air Transat - their response was simple - the Options Plus is only worth $19.50 per person each way. That is a little strange given that I paid $238.00 for the "privilege" of not receiving the service which apparently is only worth $19.50. So - no seat selection no priority luggage handling no meal. If I hadn't paid for Options Plus I would have received a better level of service - I would say live and learn but I don't believe that I will be using Air Transat again.

We travelled from London to Toronto (return flight) 22nd May and 30th May with 1 child. First time Air Transat user and had read the reviews so was very very apprehensive. However we were very impressed with the speed of check-in (both times) extremely quick through the queue. The service on board was good (only one attendant was rather abrupt but not rude) food was fine. The inflight entertainment worked fine each time although they charge £5 for headphones. Both flights were on time. Temperature on board was comfortable and there were plenty of refreshments. We would definitely use this airline again and it was good value for money.

### Air Transat customer review
On a flight from Glasgow to Toronto May 25th this aircraft was full to capacity. I had a window seat although I preferred an aisle seat. I never once left this seat on this 6.5 hour flight it was next to impossible to get out move up the aisles with service carts. Could not read a paper as passengers crammed into me could not stretch arms wanted something out of my pant pocket. forget it no leg space cramp's. For the amount of money we pay and have that nightmare of a seat is unacceptable and even if I wanted to purchase duty free that I did not try getting a credit card out of your wallet I would have to ask the other 2 passengers centre and aisle seat to stand up so I can move.

I booked a flight months ago leaving Toronto on May 24th to Orlando returning May 31st. The E-ticket I received showed a return leaving time of 4.10 so I got to the airport 2 hrs prior to expected departure. I was shocked to find out that the flight had changed departure times to 6.10 pm and I wasn't even notified. To add to the frustration the flight is now delayed another 2.5 hrs that means I stayed all day in Orlando airport waiting on Air Transat. Lesson learnt never again.

Having flown Air Transat now for several years to Canada I have always found them to be efficient and helpful during booking and flight even when crossings did not go to plan. My last return flight from Calgary to Manchester May 25th however was a delight. After boarding from what must be the worlds most miserable staffed airport in Calgary the cabin crew could not have done more to revive my good spirits. The flight was smooth and on time and we were well supplied with excellent food and refreshment throughout. Despite the long journey the cabin crew remained attentive and cheerful and added good humour. I am due to fly again in October and am looking forward to the trip. I just hope that someone teaches the Canadian security how to smile.

We travelled from Vancouver B.C to Cancun May 11th 2014 there were 16 of us. Going down was great nice plane good food and great entertainment as it was a 6 hr plus flight. Coming back some of us on May 18th and some on May 25th was a terrible flight. We were crowded in like animals in a barn sat on tarmac for 45 min no air no seat room at all and I am only 5ft 1. I feel sorry for the people that were larger than me. No entertainment at all nowhere to even plug head phones in. I mean really at the price we paid I think we should of had some kind of entertainment for a 6 hr plus Flight. This is unacceptable and I will never recommend Air Transat.

FCO to YYZ in club class. As our flight was a day flight the seats were satisfactory. Not the most comfortable and are not really designed for sleep. but better than coach. From the minute we boarded to 45 minutes prior to arrival we were fed and offered drinks. The meal out of Rome was actually good. Onboard service was excellent. I would definitely book club class for another long haul day flight. While not a true business class seat much better than many airline "premium economy". In flight entertainment while light on content offered a good quality display and usb ports. No laptop power.

LGW-YVR return in September 2013. Flight was significantly cheaper than all other alternatives and despite reservations I booked and travelled. As a Canadian living in England I have flown the route many times including with Air Transat and an unpleasant experience many years before had stuck. What a pleasant and terrific change. The experience was brilliant from check in to the aircraft food attendants and inflight entertainment. The flights were on time at destination both ways despite taking off late on the return leg.

### Air Transat customer review
Really impressed with Air Transat travelling LGW to YVR in May 2014 with my partner. Both flights equipped with new IFE and seats so pretty pleasant. Outbound flight pretty empty so had three seats each to stretch out on. Inbound almost full. Service excellent on both flights. Food comparable to other airlines; nothing to moan about. All in all very impressed and only GBP400 return.

London to Toronto recently (return flight) with 2 children. First time Air Transat user- always travelled with British airways. Very impressed with service onboard/quality of food despite being a low cost airline. Will definitely use this airline again.

### Air Transat customer review
A group of 22 family/friends travelled together for a destination wedding we flew from Toronto on May 2 with Punta Cana as our Caribbean destination. Onboard staff were friendly and efficient the plane was a newer model with 9 seats across ample leg room and individual entertainment modules. Flight was on time however the check in staff were a joke! A member of our group was overweight on luggage because he was travelling with several young children he was willing to pay the extra fee at check in but was told that he had to go to line up again at a second counter to pay the charge he got into the second line and waited and waited. The credit card machine at the cashier counter was not working properly they would not accept cash they did not have a secondary credit card machine. Finally after waiting about 20 minutes they were able to process his charge. We arrived at the gate 30 minutes before boarding although we had arrived at the airport 3 hours prior to departure.

Fly from Edmonton to Dominican Republic in March. Arrived at airport for check-in 3 hrs before boarding time to find out the flight was going to be delayed by 6 hrs. As the morning progressed the delay lengthened tried to find out information and staff at counter was not helpful was told to call customer service. We did and we had the most rude lady answer the call she actually hung up on us. Sent an email to the customer relations email (which was never replied to). Finally boarded the plane almost 8 hrs delayed. Upon returning home I emailed Transat again. Received an email 4.5 weeks after with them stating that the fine print basically means they aren't responsible for anything and the food vouchers would be given as credit towards the next vacation with them. Lousy customer service and lousy contact.

### Air Transat customer review
Flew May 2nd from Vancouver to Manchester! I was really pleased with the airline and staff. I have paid a lot more in the past and not received as good a service! My personal TV screen froze halfway through the flight so I couldn't use it but that didn't really bother me as I just went to sleep and no one else seemed to be experiencing the same problem. I am flying back on May 23rd with my dog so that is going to be the worrying part but hopefully everything will go smoothly! I also got option plus would recommend to anyone! Is not that much extra and jut the priority baggage made my trip a lot easier!

### Air Transat customer review
SNU-YUL with an old A310. It's not the first time that I traveled with Air Transat and I must admit that it was not the best flight. The flight departed late and the cabin was very hot when we boarded because the air conditioning system had broken during the landing of the previous flight. During the flight we hit a lot of turbulence and the crew could not serve any meals during that long period. After that they rushed to do that service. The meal and the crew were fine nothing special. The seat was a bit uncomfortable it's the same comfort for their longest flights to Europe but I enjoyed extra legroom because it was an emergency exit seat. The inflight entertainment was an old movie show on the overhead screens. I also found some announcements made in French were a bit unprofessional but they were made in a joyful tone. Overall despite the turbulence the flight was fine. I've travelled a couple of times with Air Transat to their Europe flights and the crew (some of them are friendly while a few were unprofessional) the service and the seats are all the same nothing special. If you expect a five star service you should fly with another airline.

### Air Transat customer review
I purchased Option Plus for a return flight Toronto-Manchester. Outbound leg on April 6th provided excellent check in and also cabin service. Onboard our meal order was taken ahead of the economy passengers and also served earlier which provided a nice hot meal. Unfortunately the return flight on April 14th provided abysmal service right from check in. Even though we were travelling Option Plus red priority tags were not put on our bags by the young lady checking us in and when I pointed this out she told me they will be attached before they go on the aircraft and I should just trust her. Obviously I knew this to be untrue as I have used Transat many times in the past and of course I had to wait 40 minutes in Toronto for my bags. We left Manchester at 9.15 am and lunch service did not start until 2.30pm which is far too late and on this newly configured aircraft (2x4x2) the cabin crew served the meals from the front rows to the back rows which takes far to long if you are seated in the back and you end up with a cold meal. Option Plus passengers were not served in advance as we were on the outbound flight and when I pointed this out I was told I was mistaken. Basically Option Plus is not worth the extra money as the priority boarding and priority services you are supposed are often not delivered. The service is always more miss than hit and seemingly more so with the Montreal based cabin crews. Air Canada Rouge is starting to fly this same route so next month I'll probably give them a try instead. Air Transat cannot complain as I've given them enough opportunities over the year's to get it right.

### Air Transat customer review
Wedding party going to Grand Bahia Principe Mexico from Calgary April 9 2014 was a smooth trip looked to be a newer plane the flight attendants appeared to be a bit frazzled and in a hurry. I had to ask frequently for water and a possible newspaper to which I never received. The trip back to Calgary April 16 2014 was also a smooth flight. The flight attendants were an excellent group of attentive professionals with charismatic humour and precision service.

### Air Transat customer review
I flew from YYZ-AMS on A310 which had to be at least 10 years old it had not yet had the livery update and had terrible food. All of their A310s should of had Personal TVs and the new livery - but no this one. The PA was broken so we had a FA marching up and down the aisle yelling the safety instructions. Never Again.

### Air Transat customer review
Over the past 7 years we have flown with Transat twice a year from Gatwick to Toronto Halifax Calgary and Vancouver. We have never experienced any serious delays outwards and only rarely inbound due to winter weather conditions. We always book the 'two seat' rows at the rear of the plane and they are perfectly comfortable. The seat pitch is good too. The food whilst not exciting is always hot well served and perfectly edible and includes a small but free glass of wine. We have never experienced rude lazy or indifferent staff either. All in all I would rate AT as very good value for money and are in fact about to take a flight with them again this week.

### Air Transat customer review
Travelled with a group of 60 to a wedding in Jamaica from Toronto. At Toronto airport the check in had all the lap babies with the wrong parents. Flight there was good. Staff on the plane were very courteous. Again at check in at Montego Bay airport they had lap babies with the wrong parents. The man that checked us in told us we didn't need a sticker for our stroller then when we were boarding the same man that checked us in lectured us about not having a sticker. Staff onboard the plane were again very nice although we did ask for a drink for our son and never did get it. When we landed in Toronto we had to wait about an hour and a half to get our strollers. We questioned the staff at the counter about where it was and why it was taking so long. They informed us it was being drug screened. The rest of our flight had gone except those of us waiting for our strollers and golf clubs. So we had a bus of 60 ppl outside waiting to leave but couldn't because of us waiting. Two more flights came in after ours and people were leaving those flights and we were still waiting. After we finally got our items a couple with us got pulled into an extra screening and they were told there wasn't even a drug squad on. This info made me even more irate. That was a month ago and I have yet to get a response back. I will never fly with them again even though the inflight staff were great and made our flight easier with 2 toddlers.

### Air Transat customer review
Due to plane maintenance they delayed our flight by 7 hours so we lost our entire first day of vacation. The seats on their planes are cramped and even the aisles are hard to get through. One flight attendant explained that the company added an extra seat to every row on the plane. Forget customer comfort! We will never choose Air Transat again.

### Air Transat customer review
Travelled from Gatwick to Calgary with Air Transat. Paid extra for two seats at the back of plane (on their own with no seats adjoining them.). This was well worth the extra money. Cabin crew were very pleasant both going and coming back. Would definitely travel with Air Transat again.

### Air Transat customer review
We flew into Toronto and it was ok there was enough leg room and staff were ok however the food was awful! Coming back was even worse the food and were terrible and the comfort was poor. It was far too hot. I put the red light on to get a glass of water and I had to wait 30 mins before someone came and asked what I wanted! The movie didn't start until about 3 hours into the flight so there was nothing to do for the first 3 hours. I will never be flying with them again.

### Air Transat customer review
I returned from Toronto on an Air Transat flight which was awful. We paid extra for Option Plus which is just not worth it. The seat is still an economy seat and they are very small and uncomfortable. I sat in seat 4H and the trolleys kept hitting me whenever they went up and down. There were no personal TV's and it was difficult to watch the small screens as it gave me neck ache. Awful food awful staff and I will never fly this airline again.

### Air Transat customer review
Vancouver - Calgary - Cuba again 3x3x3 but at least we had our individual screens so we could watch what we wanted. I went option plus which gives you priority boarding. Plus a comfort pack pillow blanket ear phones small bottle of champagne and a free snack. $70 more but you do get to board first and your luggage is off loaded first so for that reason I would recommend that. I will never take another flight that's not direct again. We were supposed to 'touch down' for 45 min in Calgary to pick up passengers. Took a little longer than I was told. I never got the comfort pack until after I left Calgary. I am a looking into different options for my next trip. If you are small you may be alright in the seats. The ride home for me was painful smaller plane couldn't sleep a wink. One big screen in the middle of the plane so staff got to pick the movies. I expected nothing from the food having flown with them before and I wasn't surprised some things I never even opened. They seem to be more interested in soliciting sales for duty free than I remembered from my last trip. In Cuba Option plus meant nothing you couldn't understand a thing the woman said. In summary I don't think any airline I've found has what you would call good food. I may give them another try if they get different planes my knees were in the back of the other passengers seat for over 6hrs.

### Air Transat customer review
We booked a vacation from Edmonton AB Canada to Manzanillo Mexico on Air Transat in Feb 2014 - the first time we've ever flown with Air Transat. We then discovered that our flight was being operated by EnerJet an airline that Air Transat contracted out to. EnerJet had absolutely no in-flight entertainment on their planes and not even a power plug or USB for electronics which meant we had to go out and buy a rechargeable DVD player for the trip and load up on books etc. so that we weren't just sitting there for 5.5 hours with nothing to do. There were only 2 washrooms aboard the plane and we were at the very back of the plane the entire trip and there was a constant parade of people heading to the washrooms. The seats were very crowded also. The meal was quite good - chicken wraps and beef sandwiches with a little salad cheese crackers and a piece of fudge for dessert and the refreshments came by quite frequently which was nice.

### Air Transat customer review
Booked through AirTransat and never again. Flight of 5 hrs from Edmonton to Manzallino on March 7-14 2014. AirTransat contracted flight to Econojet. Small old plane no entertainment and no water in bathrooms and no coffee or tea. Cramped conditions and people complaining was what we experienced. So essentially we paid for something at the regular price and received a lesser quality flight/airline. As a side note the flight attendants were the only good thing never again.

### Air Transat customer review
Winnipeg to Dominican Republic on Airbus 310. We booked in Option Plus so there was a special check-in line at both airports. Thank goodness because the regular check-in line at the Punta Cana airport had over 100 people in it! We got through the Option Plus check-in line in less than 10 minutes. Option Plus holders are also allowed to board the plane first so that was nice and we knew there would be space for our carry-on in the overhead compartments (which were huge anyway). Received free champagne a small wine bottle preferred meals and a snack as well as another free alcoholic drink. Seating arrangement was a little odd though. 3x3x3. Not very many people travel in a group of 3. The seats are very small though I'm only 5'5" and it was tight for my body. I felt awful for my 6'0" boyfriend who couldn't even put his tray table down flat. The tightness of the seats really put us in a bad mood and a lot of the others on the plane were getting cranky due to the lack of room too. The food wasn't bad it was edible at least. Instead of individual televisions there were only TV's in the middle and they were small and not very high quality. I don't know why they bother having televisions at all because people were just getting frustrated when others walked by to go to the washroom or stretch and caused them to "miss" parts of the movie. The only way I would travel with Air Transat again is if I was in a row of 2 (which there were few in the back and cost extra) or in club class. Do not travel in economy class with this company you will pull your hair out and it will ruin your vacation.

### Air Transat customer review
Montreal to Paris on Airbus 310. The overall impression of this flight was bad. However lets start from positive side - check-in and boarding was ok with helpful ground staff. It should be highlighted that crew on board of the aircraft was friendly helpful professional and very skilled. The very negative side is that seats are extremely narrow and small. It is impossible to fit it. The plane A310 (very old model) was redesigned for configuration 3X3X3 (9 in total in a row instead of 7) which is really painful since 2 extra seats in each row are put in. NO TV individual screens. The food is just horrible and not eatable. NOT recommended for Paris-Montreal route and my advice is to double check the model of aircraft before booking. Avoid at any cost A310.

### Air Transat customer review
We upgraded to club class because of the extra legroom in the seats. We did not expect much as it was cheaper than Air Canada. We were in for a surprise! We flew from Toronto to Puerto Vallarta Mexico. As soon as we were seated we were offered a glass of wine. We had two cabin flight attendants for the business class. The flight attendants were very cheerful and helpful throughout the flight the food was the best we've had on any aircraft. Wrote the flight we were offered wine beer liquor the cure coffee tea anything that we wanted. The nicest part about it is there is a separate washroom for only the business class. We were hoping that the service and food would be as good on the way home. And it was. I would not hesitate to fly Air Transat again.

### Air Transat customer review
Flew out of Gatwick to Toronto 14/02/14 and back to London the following week on a new A330/200. All I can say is what a surprise! The aircraft was new the entertainment system good the staff extremely helpful and attentive. Food was ok. General service is easily on par with BA Virgin or ACA in economy - and generally a lot better in many cases. They have definitely raised their game and I see them as a credible alternative to many '4/5 star airlines' if you have to fly economy.

### Air Transat customer review
I recently had a flight from Toronto to Gatwick (UK). It was delayed by bad weather but the problem was the attitude of Transat. We should have boarded at 9pm - instead it was eventually 2am but with no food vouchers or drinks. We then sat on the plane until 5am before a glass of water was handed out. Then taxiing out two people fell ill and we returned to the gate eventually taking off at 7am. In that time no food - just one glass of water - not even coffee. We then flew to Montreal to change crew (they were out of hours that's ok) and then flew to London - and were given just a tiny slice of pizza - on a 7-hour flight! Transat offered $100 compensation and despite Customer Services at Gatwick promising they would reimburse extra travel costs they then refused. Any proper airline would pay up. No wonder Transat's passenger numbers are going down.

### Air Transat customer review
Just returned from Costa Rica. Had new A330 cabins and it was an excellent experience. Entertainment system is one of the best. Very impressive looking cabin with lighting etc. Only problem was seat comfort since they have now gone with the thin seats. Just a little uncomfortable after 8 hours. I fly extensively and this airline has really shaped up. Would choose them over any other carrier in this country.

### Air Transat customer review
Paris-Montreal. I had mixed impressions: The positive side is that Terminal 3 in CDG airport is very pleasant to use check-in staff are very competent and the security area was moving quickly. Boarding was done using buses but very well organized by the ground staff. Inflight attendants were very helpful throughout the flight. The negative side is that seats are so narrow that you cannot move a finger. The plane A330 was redesigned for configuration 3X3X3 (9 in total in a row instead of 8) which is extremely uncomfortable. It is just impossible to seat 7 hours without any changes in a position. The food is just horrible. My advice is to bring my own meal. The comfort kits costs 9 Canadian dollars which includes pillow blanket etc. This is definitely the low cost airline and overall it is an average experience. I will report about the return flight as well.

Jan 22 2014. My wife and I and 2 other couples were going to Mexico for a 2 week vacation it started in Saskatoon when the flight was 1hr 45 minutes delayed because there was no crew for the plane. Then we had to stop in Regina to pick up passengers we finally get to Puerto Vallarta at 6.15 pm we were supposed leave at 9am so that's over 9 hours to get there. Coming home yesterday we stop again in Regina to let off passengers at 9.05pm. We sat for 3 hrs because there was no crew to fly the plane. Also we had to be on the bus from our hotel at 2pm and got home at almost 2am in the morning. Unacceptable.

LGW-YVR-LGW in economy out 23/01/14 back 04/02/2014. Usually fly BA on this route but tempted by vastly cheaper fare and free ski carriage. Pleasantly surprised: outbound leg on A330 with old economy configuration meant no personal IFE but seat was comfortable legroom better than BA and crew a pleasure to deal with. Food adequate and plentiful drinks offered regularly throughout the 10 hour flight. Return leg in refitted economy - legroom tighter and seat less comfortable but IFE superb cabin very attractive with mood lighting. Crew food and drink excellent again. Only misses a 10 score because outbound flight was delayed by 3 hours - but we were informed a day in advance so no harm done. Would certainly fly Air Transat again.

Departed Jan 26 2014 for Antigua - good flight and de-iced the plane prior to take off. Returned Feb 2 2014 to Toronto - good flight - thanks to the pilots/catering in Toronto on strike - Air Transat was very considerate and gave travelers a $15 voucher to buy food at Antigua airport. Very considerate and thoughtful. Air Transat Rep greeted us at the airport. She was polite/professional. She was at Antigua airport to inform us of the hour delay food vouchers and was always informative.

We flew Club Class to Cancun for Christmas I should mention we always try to get this section and over the years have been mostly satisfied but the last couple of times we have been very unhappy the trip down was fine it was coming back that was outrageous. They only had one attendant serving this area normally there are 2 and he was rude and lazy. We had buzzed several times to have my wife's dishes taken away finally she took them to the kitchen herself and the attendant was in there looking at his phone and talking to another attendant. There were a lot of other problems at one stage a lady walked by us that wasn't even serving in our section saw the buzzer on and asked if she could help we told her what was happening she apologized and put us in touch with person over him and she took care of us for the rest of the flight. The last 3 times we have flown in Club we have been unhappy and we travel 4-5 times a year so we know what we are talking about.

### Air Transat customer review
This would have been our third time flying with Air Transat. The first time we paid extra for a direct flight and at the airport were informed that the flight had changed and now had a 3 hour stop over in Vancouver. No reimbursement or credits given. Also no explanation as to why there was a change. The second time everything was great and had no issues. I thought that the first time had just been my bad luck. I was wrong. We are six weeks away from leaving on a family vacation to Costa Rica and we were informed yesterday that the flight was cancelled. No explanation again. I will never travel with Air Transat again.

### Air Transat customer review
I have flown this airline a couple of times now and it just keeps getting worse. They call themselves "The world's best leisure airline" however the cramped seating/aircraft does not reflect this at all. In addition staff are indifferent and unhelpful. During one long flight when our monitors didn't work they couldn't have cared less. 7 hours staring at the seat in front of me. In the last instance they lost my bag that I had paid an extra $100 for it arrived at my residence 3 days later.

### Air Transat customer review
I travelled from LGW to YVR and back in Sep 2013. I had upgraded to option plus which in my opinion is quite cheap. It doesn't give you a better seat unfortunately but you get food and drink supplied throughout the flight and a comfort kit which was good to keep. The seats are quite small but I guess that's why they are the cheapest flight. I think your excited to be going on holiday so put up with the squashed seats! Very nice flight attendants and with the option plus you get served first and certainly get enough snacks etc. it was a refurbished or new plane so got new leather seats. On the return flight I was fortunate enough to be upgraded to club class perhaps they needed to fill the seats but I was extremely grateful and excited to get a bigger seat! Club class was fab compared to economy! Great food drink although flight attendants no different to my outward journey very courteous. Trouble is now if I fly with them again I want to go club class! Overall a good cheap flight worth doing option plus cheaper tickets = more spending money! I will more than likely use them again.

### Air Transat customer review
Manchester to Toronto on 23rd Dec flew club class and the flight and service was fine. However the flight home on 5th Jan was another matter. Tried to upgrade weeks earlier and was told it was full so check on the day asked at check in and was told it was $250 and that 2 people has cancelled but you had to ask when boarding and pay then so at the gate we asked again only to be told it was $360 and again you had to pay on the plane upon boarding the plane we mentioned we would like to upgrade and were told it was $460! I told the steward that this was the 3rd different price and he said that he wasn't prepared to haggle like a market trader! Couldn't believe my ears. Due to snow we then sat on the plane for 3 hours before take off which is no ones fault however in all that time the seat belt signs stayed on and no one was allowed to visit the toilet so when we finally take off and get to the right altitude virtually the whole plane is stud waiting for the loo which means food or drinks can't be served for about 1hr30 min. Flight out excellent flight home nightmare.

Returned from Cancun to Saskatoon on Flight TS 765 on January 3 2014. Flight was supposed to leave at 1620 and arrive at 2140. Flight was listed as being 50 minutes late when we checked in. Boarded about 1700. Was informed that there was a problem with one of the washrooms and that they were waiting for a truck to come. Then told tank was frozen and could not be unfrozen and the plane had only two working washrooms. Was told that flights under 4 hours could fly with 2 working washrooms but flights longer than 4 hours required 3 working washrooms. Had 2 working washrooms in the back and one in the front so there was 3 washrooms. Guess the one for the first class passengers is not to be used by economy passengers even in the event of unusual conditions so it doesn't count. The flight to Saskatoon was to take 5 hours. Transat then told us we were going to fly to Toronto (less than 4 hours) change crews then fly to Saskatoon. Left Cancun at 2030. Arrived in Toronto at 2400 and changed flight crews. Arrived Saskatoon at 0430. After arriving in Saskatoon was told that no gate was available. Had to wait another 90 minutes for a gate. Deplaned just after 0600. Now been on plane for over 12 hours. Waited 45 minutes for luggage then told equipment to unload luggage was broken. Plane would be taken to Regina luggage unloaded then delivered back to Saskatoon. Forms had to be filled out to get luggage delivered to our home. No Transat reps around. Total gong show! Passengers now becoming very vocal. Canada Immigration officials were the most helpful. Finally left airport at 0800. Luggage is to be delivered before 2400 this evening.

Travelled from London Gatwick to Toronto on 31st December 2013. As I'm moving to St. John's Newfoundland I needed the cheapest way of getting to that outpost with a large luggage allowance and the Air Transat Club Class seemed to provide that for me in terms of getting to Toronto before using another airline onwards. In the main it was excellent. The food on planes is usually of low standard but my Turkey Cacciatore was delicious the light snack meat platter before landing was equally tasty and the other little treats cookies fudge sweets champagne wine port and baileys. Inflight entertainment was fine maybe not as wide ranging as Air Canada but decent nonetheless watched a couple of interesting documentaries in between my constant scoffing. Staff were very friendly the slight downer were the seats not as comfortable some Club Class. But not the price of any Club Class aside so I have no complaints. A very good airline!

### Air Transat customer review
Manzanillo (Mexico) to Calgary (Canada) flight TS3521 on Dec 22 2013. Wanted to complain on the way passenger boarding was handled by Air Transat staff at Manzanillo airport which resulted in many young kids being separated from their parents. There was one general queue with four counters serving passengers. Then staff announced that there was a separate queue line for passengers with young kids. We and many other families moved to this queue thinking it would be faster. The problem was that the generic queue was serviced by three counters but there was only one counter serving the family queue! Moreover the only person serving the family queue had one arm in a plaster cast and was able to type in with one arm only. As a result the general queue with three counters available to them moved much faster and were all done by the time many families in the other queue were still waiting in the line. The general queue passengers got all the adjacent seats and by the time the families were allowed to reach the check-in counter the only seats left were single ones dispersed all over the cabin! Many young kids (including ours) got seats separate from their parents. When I pleaded with the counter person to find at least two adjacent seats for my youngest to be able to sit with the mom the reply was that there was nothing available and we should ask the passengers on the plane to volunteer and give us their seats. On the plane the stewardesses were able to help some (but not all) of the families by negotiating with the other passenger to swap seats. I think the above was result of a poor administration of the boarding at the airport. Had the airport staff allowed all the families with young kids to check in first before the rest of the passengers this could have been avoided.

Flight Dec/14/13 - Dec/21/13. Toronto On - Varadero Cuba. The planes were Airbus 310 with updated interiors mood lighting (very nice). No individual TV screens. Not a big issue for us! The food was good for an airline. The crew were pleasant and efficient. No problems at all. They handled our last 30 minutes of the return flight very well (plane landed in the midst of the ice storm) Scary! ( Not the airlines fault). Bravo to the cockpit and crew. We would definitely fly with Air Transat again.

### Air Transat customer review
Returned from Punta Cana yesterday. Plane itself was fine. Updated with nice lighting etc. Movies and shows/entertainment is all pretty outdated. Flight was smooth. Food there and back was not good. My biggest concern is the flight staff. Very inconsistent (some rows get wet towels before meals some don't etc). The speed with which their service is delivered is poor. My side had food drink wet wipe while my daughters side had none of those things. The food eventually was delivered about 10 minutes later. Another concern is that the attendants are quite a bit older and put respectfully not in great shape to be pushing a cart up and down narrow aisles. The airport at Punta Cana was ridiculous - there were at least 6 huge planes leaving within about 30 minutes of each other. It took over 3 hours from the arrival time to drop off luggage and get through screening and security with thousands of other travellers. Surely this could be controlled with better logistics.

### Air Transat customer review
My wife suffers with COPD so we paid the premium for club class bad idea the seating arrangements had changed since our last trip and they were uncomfortable. My headrest was continually being pushed down as it did not lock in place by people coming by to use the washroom. The food was not the greatest and my wife was becoming agitated with her discomfort. I would not pay the premium again! I am surprised by lack of concern. After three previous return flights to Britain that had been so good.

### Air Transat customer review
I tried to fly Air Transat on the 28th November from London to Vancouver (I emphasize the word try). When I checked in for my Option Plus booking I was informed that they couldn't find my booking. After consulting with a supervisor they found my booking and then casually informed me that the flight was 9 hours delayed. The ground crew were incredibly unsympathetic (I was travelling for urgent business reasons) and couldn't be bothered to stop taking phone calls and chatting despite having a distraught passenger right in front of them. I asked for a full refund which I have yet to receive and ran to catch a British Airways flight at Heathrow. My advice avoid Transat if you care about customer service and are at all serious about actually getting to where you plan to go.

My husband and I recently flew from LGW (London Gatwick) to YYZ (Toronto Pearson) in economy class. The flight left on time at 9.35am UTC and arrived at 12.45pm EST in Toronto. The flight was about 8 hours and ten minutes long. Everything was very smooth with just a few minutes of mild turbulence as we were landing. The movies were ok - a lot of international film festival movies. We were lucky to fly on one of the updated planes with the modern entertainment units on each seat. I have flown Air Transat overseas several times and I find the eastbound journey is usually the older planes as most people sleep during the overnight flight. The eastbound journey is with the updated planes as most people are away for the midday flight. The food is pretty awful but what can you expect for economy rates? My husband did get food poisoning when we were flying to Europe so from now on we only eat their vegetarian meals if at all possible. Constant queue for toilets but what can you expect with over 300 people on a plane? Overall they were enjoyable flights and we would fly with them again. Excellent value for your money.

Flew from Gatwick to Vancouver. Paid for a seat and got about 3/4 because the person in the middle was so large. Food horrible. Of course the crew started at the front of the plane and because there was some turbulence they had to stop serving for 10 minutes and return to the back galley so when they continued and got to the rear it was also cold.

### Air Transat customer review
Crew were amazing planes nice and clean roomy seats and flights were on time. Food excellent staff truly there for the passengers!. Every one smiles asking for water is not a crime as it is on some airlines.

### Air Transat customer review
We had an excellent experience with Air Transat - like others on this forum we were a little concerned about some of the problems experienced but we have nothing but good things to say about them. Both flights were on time the planes were recently refurbished and the staff were excellent good humored and ready to help with any request. We had seat back entertainment on the way home which was the best touch screen system I have used on a plane and makes others look clunky. A staff member at Toronto airport went above and beyond the call of duty when she got us onto our return flight when we'd been delayed by Toronto traffic - we shouldn't really have made it on but her determination saved us hundreds of pounds we'd have incurred for booking a one way flight back to the UK. Would definitely fly with them again.

### Air Transat customer review
I flew one way from London Gatwick to Toronto in October 2013. The reason for choosing Air Transat was simply cost - other airlines are not interested in selling one-way fares. Only Air Transat and Icelandair offer reasonable prices for one-way trips and only Air Transat is non-stop. Both Air Canada and British Airways wanted about $1900 from London Heathrow to Toronto whereas Air Transat (from Gatwick) was under $500. The check-in agent at Gatwick was rude but she was the only employee I could possibly say anything negative about and since all other staff went out of their way to be positive I will just ignore this one bad apple. The flight attendants were all very friendly and helpful as were the people at the gate. The flight left and arrived on time to the minute. Food was - well let's just say no worse than any other airline. I think the legroom was a bit better than some others. My luggage was on the carousel by the time I got through immigration. There truly is nothing to complain about. The particular plane that I was on did not have seat-back video but instead had the older style screens with their choice of movies. I brought a book to read so did not really even watch this. Really with all the negative experiences I have become accustomed to when flying I must say that this flight (my first flight with Air Transat) was a rare positive.

### Air Transat customer review
Just back from trip to Toronto and very satisfied with Air Transat experience. Flights on time excellent staff pleasant interior with great lighting and food was surprisingly good. Downside is width of seats which make eating rather difficult. Would I fly with them again? A big yes. Great value for money. Honestly don't listen to the negative comments.

September 16 2013 my husband daughter and I flew from Athens to Toronto. Unfortunately when we fastened our seats belts and were ready to depart our captain mentioned that we would be stopping in Paris to get more fuel. I do not understand how a direct flight includes a stop to get gas. Secondly customers should be warned beforehand because we would have booked another flight if we had known about this stop. We arrived to Paris at 3.45pm making it a 3 hour flight with an hour late departure from Athens. Told we would be leaving shortly but unfortunately an hour wait turned into a 6 hour wait. During this time we were told by a crew member that something was wrong with our engine and we would have to wait and see if it could be fixed or not. The way we were all treated was unacceptable! We stayed onboard for 6 hours we were not given water or food during this wait. We understand that safety is first and that mechanics were working on our plane but no one thought of the passengers. After 6 hours the captain told us that there was a computer problem and it had been reset but then we were told that because of our crew we had to stop again in Newfoundland. After 13 hours on that plane we were fed with a meal. We constantly asked for water and were told that the crew would be coming around for everyone and after waiting an hour no water was given. In the end we will never fly with Air Transat again and we would not recommend Air Transat. Our 8 hour flight turned into a 20 hour flight.

YUL-ATH-YUL Sept 15 30. Flew outbound on one of the new cabins nicely done and seatback entertainment is great good selection no heads in the way. New seats are closer together and bottom cushions could use extra padding. Still flight was fine no issues. Food drink etc was good. They could cut back on the announcements on an overnight flight when you are trying to catch a few ZZ. Don't really need duty free at 5am. Returned on one of the older models and although it had old layout we preferred since our seats were changed from the 3 configuration by the window to the 2 by the window there seems to be a bit more room. Again no issues with the flight except for the impatient non instruction follow passengers. Pushing people out of the way before the doors are even open won't get you off the plane any quicker.

### Air Transat customer review
Good trick to make money for Air Transat we flew from Toronto to Barcelona while seated before taking off the air conditioner was on full blast. Later on flight attendants came out to sell blankets for $9.00 each and you get to keep this blanket. This is the first time I experienced this advice to all flying Air Transat to have a sweater or jacket at hand before boarding. Other than that the flight was smooth and service was satisfactory.

### Air Transat customer review
Flew club class into Nice from Montreal on Sept 19 and unfortunately did not get a refurbished aircraft. The service was not very good which has not been my experience in the past. Wouldn't see a flight attendant for an hour or more at a time. Almost had to beg for a glass of water. Food was ok only. We flew back out of Venice club class on Oct 5th and it was a fabulous experience. The aircraft had the new cabin and the staff were excellent. Super service and very attentive. Seats were comfortable and the entertainment system was great. All in all the return flight was superb but unfortunate that the 2 trips varied so greatly.

### Air Transat customer review
I flew Air Transat mid-August 2013 to August 31 2013 for a tour of Italy. I pre-ordered my seats in order to book a window and 2-seater. I found the leg room to be very roomy. They had mood lighting in the aircraft which was very nice. On the flight from Toronto to Rome I was looking forward to individual TV monitors but there was a change with the aircraft and we had a big screen at the centre of the aircraft. Fortunately returning from Rome to Toronto we did have TV's leg room and wonderful service. I would recommended.

### Air Transat customer review
This was my 2nd trip with Air Transat. This time flew Vancouver-London September 27 returning October 5 Economy class. Outbound refurbished plane return trip the more "tired" version. Both trips staff very pleasant and service good (from check-in to arrival). I am not a large person but I can definitely see how someone close to 6 feet and taller could be quite uncomfortable but the refurbished cabin is a bit more comfortable brighter and modern. I would highly recommend bringing your own food and snacks on board as the food served is absolutely dire. I know this is budget travel but seeing as the food service is about the only thing to look forward to while sitting for 10 hours surely they could do a little better! I will fly Air Transat again the money saved is better spent at my destination. I will hope that all of the fleet is refurbished before then and I will certainly bring my own more nutritious and tasty food!

### Air Transat customer review
Traveled from Gatwick on 8th Sep to Calgary and back on 29th September. On both flights my wife needed wheelchair assistance the whole service was excellent. We booked rear seats in option plus which was worth every penny. The seats were very comfortable on both flights staff very cheerful and helpful good food with all the extras of option plus. Both flights were on the upgraded planes with individual entertainment in the back of each seat which was good. All in all I would recommend this Airline to anyone compared to others we have traveled on to Canada. I would most certainly book with them again.

### Air Transat customer review
Flew from Toronto to Rome and then Venice to Toronto. Had seats in Club Class Good seats excellent service and decent food. And your luggage comes off the plane first. Only complaint is that we had to pay extra for bikes and the payment could not be made at the check in counter but required me to go somewhere else to make the payment. Also more movies to choose from would have been nice.

### Air Transat customer review
Outbound flight Gatwick to Toronto was fine paid for extra leg room and the cabin configuration was the conventional 242 check in at Gatwick was in the bowels of the building and was tediously slow good in flight entertainment. Return flight was on their new 3x3x3 configuration which was like flying in a sardine tin. Did not get the extra leg room seats we had ordered and paid for the new configuration makes it impossible to get any sleep on night flights the aisles are so narrow that passing passengers stewards and trolleys bump into you all the time. This is the only overnight transatlantic flight I have ever taken where you need to buy or bring your own blanket! This is taking penny pinching to a whole new level. Food was edible but not a lot of it so if your planning to fly Transat take your own food with you avoid night flights and don't forget your own blanket shin and elbow guards! I suggest you consider another airline or book their business class option which is competitively priced but difficult to get as there are so few seats (3 rows I think).

### Air Transat customer review
YUL-ATH-YUL all flights were fine and on time with the new cabin with individual screens on the outbound leg only. Check in was normal. The seats were uncomfortable for both flights despite the new cabin. In flying entertainment was good for the outbound leg with a choice of recent movies but it was bad on the return flight that showed 3 old movies on the overhead screens. The service onboard was normal nothing special. The crew was fine but some of them are rude and unwelcoming towards ground agents. I usually fly with Air Transat because there's convenient non stop flights and I had a stand by ticket so no complains on that side. Overall Air Transat is not the best airline as it claims and if you expect a 5 star service it's not the right airline.

### Air Transat customer review
Calgary to London Gatwick and return. Everything was very smooth efficient and pleasant on both fights from check-in to in-flight service and getting our baggage. The flight to London was overnight and there weren't individual screens (3 out of 5 *) but they did play a movie or 2 and a show perhaps on the overhead monitors. I was trying to sleep so I didn't pay attention although I did notice the picture in the screens would jump/flicker regularly. The food was okay for airplane food and they were good with running the drink carts up and down regularly while still allowing quiet time for people to rest. The lighting overhead was really neat since it mimicked sunset and sunrise accordingly. The flight back to Calgary was daytime and there were individual seat back monitors which was awesome. Good selection of free tv shows movies even games and it worked flawlessly (5 out of 5*). I bought the ear buds on board with one of the packages available: the ear buds a snack (chocolate bar) and an alcohol beverage (Baileys) for $9 or $10. You could buy them separately for $3. Lunch wasn't fantastic taste-wise I had the chicken stir fry but it was still a meal and I'm not super picky. I do wish there was a little better selection of snacks - only caramilk or plain pringles but I should've remembered to buy snacks beforehand in the airport and I'm sure they're limited on space. Very friendly attendants on the flight to Calgary. We arrived almost 30 minutes early and it was a nice smooth flight. Baggage was already waiting on the carousel.

Toronto - Manchester and return. Outbound in economy back in Club. Have used Transat previously and am pleased to note general gradual improvements. Economy is adequate and Club quite good. Staff fine both flights arrived early. Will use again.

### Air Transat customer review
Manchester to Calgary and return on TS215/214 Club class. New upgraded cabin. Priority check-in and first to board the plane. Suitcases labeled priority and first off the carousel. The seating is excellent a decent amount of recline and lumbar support good legroom they aren't really meant for sleeping but do offer a good amount of rest. The staff couldn't be faulted attentive polite always ready to assist. The meals were of a very good quality presented on porcelain plates with metal cutlery with drinks to follow. The entertainment system had a touch screen with modern films TV progs music radio etc and could be paused at anytime. A travelling kit was also provided which included a blanket flight socks earphones blowup neck support earplugs eye mask etc. Overall I thought that the experience was worth what I paid and would do the same again I realise that everyone has a budget and it is expensive for the extras for the extra money paid this could be another weeks holiday to someone.

### Air Transat customer review
I've flown all over the world frequently for more than 20 years. I'm sorry to say that my experience with Air Transat is the worst I've met. The flights took place on 27 August and 16 September 2013 Amsterdam - Vancouver v.v. In my opinion it's a crime to put so many rows in an airplane with seats so narrow that now a week later I still suffer from a sore shoulder and right arm. The back of my seat couldn't be moved in any direction. Alas the one of the passenger in front of me could so when she did which she did during 9 hours my face being 20cm from her seat. My seat itself was tilted slightly forwards so it felt like gliding off it all of the time. About the food I will not bother you it was hardly edible. Never again.

### Air Transat customer review
Not really worth the extra money. I flew with Corsair Business class two months ago and for the same extra money I had more comfort than the Transat new refurbished Club Class I also flew their Club Class a couple of years ago with their let me tell you that their seats were more comfortable then the new one. Unfortunately I have booked return the same way.

Flew Toronto to Dublin Sep 1 and returned from Shannon Sep 17. Updated interior nice with great lighting. Seats are comfortable enough even for such a long flight. I love that they offer non stop flights for such a reasonable price. Then attendants were very nice. Smooth check in both flights right on time. A great experience and I am not a great flyer. Would recommend.

### Air Transat customer review
Travelled from Manchester to Calgary on 30th June and returned 28th July. Its the first time we have flown with Air Transat after reading some reviews we were not looking forward to it. I need not have worried flights were better than some major airlines we have flown with. On both flights our seats were changed as we had pre-booked seats on refurbished plane but it ended up an older one. Just one of those things next time we might be ok.

### Air Transat customer review
Flew to London August 20. Flew first class and it puts Air Canada to shame. So much cheaper and better amenities. Planes are modern inside and crew were enjoying their job. Service was excellent. Flights were $800 cheaper per person than competitors. Food was outstanding wine choices snacks and overall experience would make this my airline of choice. Seats very comfortable and pleasant.

### Air Transat customer review
The check-in process at YYZ took hours (1 counter open for most of the process) and our pre-assigned seats were not available to us so we had to take another row (what good is pre-booking seats if they just change them on you when get there?) Onboard service was basically non-existent no in-seat video bathrooms all at the back of plane only accept credit card food served in a boxes. Corporate customer service pretends to care but in reality when confronting them one on one they hide behind their fine print and turn their noses up at you if you have an issue. I would not recommend purchasing anything from this airline.

### Air Transat customer review
Booked a package to Puerto Vallarta Mexico Aug 3-10 from YVR and they chartered out their planes to Enerjet instead of using Air Transat. Flights there and back were good friendly flight attendants and very friendly check in agents both flights arrived only slightly later than scheduled. I was pleased that Enerjet would honor Air Transats speciality ordered food selection. I had pre-ordered gluten free meals for my flights. On this flight my meal going down to Mexico was a GF meal consisting of one rice cake folded in half with one piece of ham in the middle along with a tiny container of coleslaw. The lack of food surprised me! Positive note is that when I checked in for my flight the check in agent reconfirmed with me my meal request. Meanwhile the regular meals consisted of a large sized wrap piece of fudge cheese and crackers and a potato salad. Thank goodness I brought along snacks to eat. On the flight home the flight attendant didn't bring me a GF meal but tried to serve me a regular meal I then mentioned my pre-order of a GF meal and she said they don't really have any as they had to hand it out on the way to Mexico that day. I let her know that I saw on the cart as she rolled up to me the food requests listed and saw it said 2 GF. She then phoned another FA in the back of the plane and brought me a GF meal. The same tiny meal on my way up but at least it was something. But yet again the regular meals to other passengers were double the portion variety and selection as the GF option. I was surprised that there was no inflight movie.

### Air Transat customer review
Flew back from Toronto to Canada. After a pleasant flight out found the flight back just as good. Staff friendly even taking time to speak to my teenage daughter who was a nervous flyer. Food good. Seats aren't the roomiest but nevertheless comfortable. Would definitely fly with them again.

### Air Transat customer review
LGW-YVR - I was pleasantly surprised by Air Transat thinking it would be a charter-type service/comfort. The plane was a new Airbus A330 with comfortable leather finish seats mood lighting an iPad like touch screen in seat entertainment system (though the choice of movies wasn't huge but still decent for a 9 hour flight) and ample legroom (despite them adding an extra two row of seats than normal on this type of aircraft). The cabin crew were courteous and helpful and the food was decent. Overall a great experience which was better than flights on the same route with BA or Air Canada which have more dated planes and entertainment systems.

### Air Transat customer review
Worst flight I have ever been on narrow seats with arm rests which would not fold down - rude staff who were not interested in passenger needs. My daughter was ill during the last 3 hours of the 9 hour flight from Vancouver to Glasgow. When I asked for some water I was asked to wait until the crew had finished collecting the garbage! It never arrived! Heaven knows how they would deal with a serious emergency on board. We asked for milk for the coffee - the response was "we only give out cream with the coffee". Recommend this airline? Not a chance!

### Air Transat customer review
Flew 19 June 2013 Manchester - Calgary return flight 30 June 2013 Calgary - Manchester. Experienced tired old systems and lacking a good meal outbound. Basically handed the left over of a vegetarian meal. Both aircraft's were dated mediocre entertainment repeated on the return journey. Please note that the prices are very cheap for these flights so one has to weigh up the pros and cons. A great deal of consideration will have to be made regarding any future travel. I will admit that the money saved gave us extra for our holiday arrangements. You get what you pay for in this instance.

Flew Glasgow to Toronto and back definitely no frills but took off on time outbound and inbound food okay didn't use the entertainment as it is old style screens. Didn't get any more or less than expected. Would fly with them again.

LGW-YVR TS 577 Jul 26 2013. YVR-LGW TS 676 10 Aug 2013. Pretty good on the whole. Being over 6ft isn't wildly comfortable should have chosen my seat better. Only comment is that it seems to get a smiley person to serve you you need to be in club class. There were some miserable flight attendants - passengers were polite around us and made the effort but the flight attendants didn't. We were near the front and the attendants in club class were very cheerful. It doesn't cost anything to smile and be helpful - some customer service training is required. Ground staff were excellent and helpful both ways. Good flight very smooth. Aircraft interior a bit old but you get what you pay for it was considerably cheaper than BA etc.

Flew to Amsterdam on July 20th and returned to Calgary August 10th 2013. My experience has been very good. On the flight to Amsterdam I had requested a gluten free meal somehow it was not recorded and there was not a meal for me. I think my booking was too close to my departure which I was not aware of. The crew were very helpful and gave me cheese fruit and milk as I had taken my own crackers and cereal for my stay in Holland. It was not a big deal. Called their office upon my arrival in Holland and was told they would make sure I would be given a gluten free meal on my return to Calgary. Again staff very pleasant and apologized for the mistake that was made.

Flew Gatwick to Edmonton on 15th July and Edmonton to Gatwick on 29th July on Airbus flew club class for the comfort. Both flights were good with excellent food and service. The journey home was a night flight and the cabin lights were turned off though of course flying that way it never gets completely dark. My only complaint was with Gatwick we arrived two hours before check in opened due to us having travelled from Manchester by coach. There was nowhere to sit down so we had to stand for the whole two hours. Once we got to check in we were told that our club class ticket did not give us entry to the club lounge and we would be expected to pay extra for that I did not pay as when we flew from Manchester to Calgary in 2011 again club class we were given both fast track through security and entry to the club lounge. I would recommend Air Transat but not Gatwick.

Vancouver to Paris and back. Flight over was great plane with new interior. Food was decent and the staff very friendly. On are way back we had an older plane the individual LCD screen that was not very responsive but once the film started it worked well. My only complaint is that when there was an announcement on the intercom when you were using the entertainment "with ear buds" was way too loud.

### Air Transat customer review
Toronto (YYZ) to Italy (FCO) - July 2013. We flew Toronto to Rome on one of their A330's with the upgraded cabin design. A very welcome sight given that it won be just shy of a 9 hr flight. The flight was on time and the crew were very friendly and professional. Food was adequate and sufficient with both a main meal of either chicken pasta or beef and a light breakfast snack just prior to landing. While the upgraded cabin was a welcome addition it appeared that the seating was a little less spacious than that of other flights we have taken with Air Transat. In any event it was a pleasant flight and we will continue to fly with Air Transat.

### Air Transat customer review
Booked a family flight to Paris in July to stay there 8 days before our final destination which was booked as a separate segment with another carrier. I flew Air Transat before so I knew the food quality older planes and other things to be expected with a lower cost carrier. After all that why/how you save money. Wrong - Air Transat decided to change the schedule of our return flight to Toronto by 2 hrs (delaying it) so we only had 55 minutes between flights in Paris with a terminal change in CDG which is physically impossible. If you really want the cheapest flight and it's only one segment then maybe you can consider them. However for multi-segment flights it's asking for trouble. Don't waste your money unless you're flying point to point and are prepared to accept the mediocre flight conditions.

### Air Transat customer review
Check-in off to bad start at Gatwick - slow moving queue not enough staff. Real problem started when arrived at desk girl checked our passports then disappeared with them for inordinate time eventually returned but without giving us any info disappeared again to see her supervisor. After delay of over an hour it eventually turned out Air Transat had messed up my wife's booking and given her a completely wrong name but they did not seem to have a clue how to sort it out. It was only because our travel company rep had back-up evidence of our booking that we were allowed to travel and then not seated together otherwise we'd still have been in Gatwick not Calgary. Once on aircraft the service was slow and disorganised - not that it mattered the food was virtually inedible and the air conditioning was so ferocious I was completely clogged up and single-handedly keeping Kleenex in business for most of the flight and the next day. These are just my main complaints.

### Air Transat customer review
After fiasco of outbound flight to Calgary we were promised better seats inbound from Vancouver to Gatwick. Air Transat's idea of better seats differs from mine. While theoretically we had more legroom being by the emergency exit that space was virtually permanently occupied by the queue for the loo so far from being able to stretch out my long legs I was claustrophobically hemmed in. Add to that it was the narrowest airline seat I've tried to fit in and I may be tall but I'm not wide. Problem is the standard economy class configuration for an A330 is 8 across Transat fit in 9 - maybe tolerable on short haul ludicrous on long haul. Food and inflight entertainment still rubbish charging if you wanted headphones! Could go on but will just summarise with - never again.

### Air Transat customer review
I live in Canada and my Daughter lives in Scotland I have flown with this Airline many times but this was my Daughters first time to Canada. We booked her ticket with Air Transat because of the non-stop flight . My Daughter is 12 and I was quite wary of her flying all this way alone so we paid for the Kids Club she had a great flight all staff were warm and courteous towards her. She wanted to return early to Scotland and her ticket was changed. From the moment we approached the Air Transat desk she was given VIP treatment and she had the same on her flight home. All in all I would recommend this Airline for anyone wishing their young kids to fly anywhere.

### Air Transat customer review
LGW-YVR-LGW. Booking suggested that flights would be on refurbished planes so we were disappointed to discover at check-in that both flights were on an old tired A330-300 with 21 rather than 12 seats in club class and very dated overhead IFE. Despite that the overall experience was surprisingly good with priority boarding and baggage friendly FAs reasonable food and wine and departure and arrival on time both ways. There were also small touches like individually served main courses and freshly grated parmesan and pepper/salt grinders that was superior to big-name carriers like BA. Overall definitely not full business class but better than premium economy.

### Air Transat customer review
First time with Air Transat and we were very disappointed in the level of customer service. They only take credit card on the plane so if you want to buy a blanket you have to charge it. The plane to Amsterdam only had TV's in the overhead so if you didn't like the movie on the 8 hours flight then you had to suffer. If you are sitting near the front and have to use the bathroom - good luck because the toilets are at the very back of the plane (the other two at the front of the plane are reserved for the 20 people in Business Class). During check in at Pearson they only had 1 counter open for economy class and 2 counters open for Business Class. We were also lied to at the check-in counter about a 'change of planes' for the reason we didn't get out pre-purchased seat assignments. Overall a bad choice of airline.

### Air Transat customer review
Manchester to Toronto and return. This is a budget airline at non budget prices. They don't accept cash on board charge you for headsets and blankets. The try to stop you using your own headset. They turn down the air conditioning just after take off to try and get you to rent a blanket the turn it up again. No seat screens only overhead ones hence no choice. Food was basic and just about thrown at you. Miserable flight attendants. The only plus was the flight was on time. On the return we stood in a line for 2.5 hours to check in. The check in opened 2 hours later that advertised. Apparently due to a switch of aircraft. No offer of drinks etc. apparently they had to input all data manually. People with pre booked seats and boarding passes all had to wait they were even altering seating at the gate. Left 45 mins late. Would never use Air Transat again. The have a monopoly on the Manchester - Toronto route so don't give a hoot.

### Air Transat customer review
Flew Manchester to Vancouver and Calgary to Manchester return in Club Class in June 2013. Two very different experiences. Outbound a refurbished cabin which was clean light and airy - excellent. Wide leather seats with ample legroom even for my 6' 4" son. Attentive crew pampered throughout with good food and drinks. Excellent personal inflight entertainment screen and film selection. Overall a high quality experience which exceeded our expectations and was great value for money. Score "10 out of 10". Inbound flight an old aircraft tired and tatty. Only saving grace good legroom and staff did their best to keep customers happy. Overall an average experience which was at bare minimum for price paid. The sooner Air Transat complete the upgrade of all planes the better. Score "6 out of 10".

### Air Transat customer review
LGW-YYZ-LGW Jul 9 and 20 in Club Class. My expectations were not particularly high but were exceeded in almost all areas. Check-in/boarding etc. were fine at both airports and priority baggage delivery also worked well. On board the crews were excellent professional and friendly service was good with edible meals served on china with proper cutlery drinkable wine and some nice touches like hot cookies and Irish coffee mid-way across. Seats are reasonable grey leather with 38" pitch and in a small cabin of only 12 seats ; not much recline but adequate. A blanket is offered but no pillow an odd omission. The IFE is fine with a fair choice of films/programmes but the headphones are of poor quality and provide insufficient sound. The outbound flight was delayed by bad weather in YYZ but operated on their revised schedule inbound was on time. All in all a good experience which I shall use again.

Just travelled Manchester to Toronto. Airbus A310. Plane light and airy. Seats comfy if a little cramped. No seat back entertainment. But we were aware of this and took own iPads etc. Food and service very good. All in all a very good flight and would have no hesitation flying with them again. Hope the flight home just as good.

### Air Transat customer review
Yes seats and aisles are small but aren't they like that on most charter airlines. I found both ground staff and cabin crew to be very helpful and attentive. I booked an option plus ticket for a minimal charge and the extra benefits where fantastic. More luggage choice of meals bottle of champagne bottle of wine with meals and all other snacks and drinks as required. Staff made sure your drinks were topped up and constantly making sure everything was alright. Return flight was an overnight flight and lights were dimmed for those passengers wanting to sleep. Passengers who were sleeping were not disturbed at meal times but were asked on waking if they now wanted to eat which I thought was exceptional of staff. Both flights left and arrived on time and on outgoing flight a problem with one of the passengers was death with swiftly and thoroughly. Will definitely fly Air Transat again.

### Air Transat customer review
Air Transat exceeded my expectations. The service was much friendlier and more enjoyable then most non-charter airlines. On our return from Amsterdam after upgrading we were upgraded again to Club Class and everything from the ipad style entertainment to the food and the service was exceptional. When we couldn't land in Toronto because of the infamous rain storm the pilots and staff provided safe comfortable and informative service and maintained their good humour. Not easy to do with a plane full of people moaning about the closed airport.

Toronto to Gatwick return. Flights on time but do not waste your money on advance seat selection. Did not get paid for seats on either flight couldn't even sit with my wife on the return flight. Advance check in website did not work for return flight most seemed to be in the same predicament as check in line was huge but no one using the bag drop line. Check in agent tried to charge overweight for bag that he stuffed into the scale but strangely enough weight was fine when bag was put on the belt properly. Upgraded to Club at gate for outbound flight when original seats were unavailable old seats armrest trays and no seatback entertainment not really much different from economy. I wasn't expecting much from airline food but the meals in both directions were of a standard I would have hesitated to give to my dog.

Toronto to London in June. Flight out was on a plane not yet completely remodelled but certainly comfortable. The overhead TVs were a downside to this plane and are almost impossible to see from many seats. We left TO on time and only complaint besides the TVs was the temperature in the cabin was very warm. On return we were in a larger completely remodelled aircraft with TV at every seat. We paid extra for bulkhead seats directly behind the premium seats and there was tons of legroom-worth the money. Unfortunately this area is where families often travel and we had a child who was noisy-crying a lot during the flight. I would not have been impressed if I had paid the extra for a business class seat as the kids were directly behind those seats. All this being said I was pleased with the flight and thought it was good value for the money.

Took the Option Plus with emergency exit seats. Would recommend exit seats in the middle of the plane not the 3 towards the window as every time I fell asleep someone would fall over my feet. Option Plus was really convenient especially the speedy check in however I would rather pay a bit more and go for Club Class. Service was probably the best service I have seen in years. They constantly have a smile on their face and after a chat with one of the flight attendants it seems that they actually like their job. Food was the typical Airline food - had worse had better. Both flights reached their destination ahead schedule and the planes were clean and had a personal TV at each seat.

Booked round trip flights for our family of 4 (2 adults 2 kids) to the UK from Vancouver. Flew AT576 YVR-LGW and I just returned on AT677 LGW-YVR (wife and kids return next week). Overall pleasantly surprised. They were by far the cheapest option for us compared to Air Canada and BA. Both flights ran on time and were comfortable. Food was fine and service was good - cabin crew came through often and were attentive. They give the kids a goodie bag which kept them amused. If you travel with kids under 12 sign up for the kids club (free). They get priority check-in boarding snack vouchers priority luggage etc. Finally a perk to travelling with kids! Only complaint was that we didn't get the new cabin interiors on either flights which meant no individual TV screens but I see they are on a 2 year plan to complete this by 2014. I would use them again if their prices were competitive to the big carriers.

### Air Transat customer review
Great prices reasonably comfortable seats but a risky airline compared to others. Glitches from the start with online booking and customer service is non-existent. We had Option Plus but still had to wait more than an hour in chaotic confined area for boarding passes at Gatwick. My wife's "priority" bag didn't show up in Vancouver and the crew there seemed utterly confused as to what to do after I eventually found the service desk. Fortunately they found the bag in London and sent it to Vancouver the next day but were not able or willing to forward it to our house in Washington state necessitating a trip at my expense to the border to pick it up. Even with the great prices I would be very reluctant to use them again.

### Air Transat customer review
Club Class is not really a business class it is somewhere in between Premium economy and Business class. Saw the promising advertisement of new Club Class cabin and booked one way trip to London in Club class got seat confirmation in the new cabin right away. 1 month later during check-in process figured out that the flight will be serviced by the old aircraft (old cabin is nowhere close to Business class and is not worth the money). At the airport during the check-in process faced extreme rudeness and inprofessionalism of the person at the check-in counter. If you are a regular business class passenger do not waste your money and time on this airline.

### Air Transat customer review
Return trip London - Vancouver. On the flight out the cabin crew were pleasant and attentive although not carrying pens when every passenger has to complete a customs form seemed an oversight. Food was perfectly adequate and occasional sights visible (Iceland Greenland) announced by the Captain. Return leg was bumpier and whilst still pleasant one of the cabin crew was French Canadian without perfect English which made drinks selections a little difficult (she didn't seem to know what root beer or cranberry juice was). Both legs landed early. Entertainment was appalling - a small TV about every eight rows hanging from the ceiling. Fortunately had a kindle and ipad with me. Cabin was very cold and if you want a blanket you have to buy it. I wouldn't call it "cheap" but seems to be the least expensive way to the North American West so can forgive their short comings. Not complaint free and I wouldn't label them 'best leisure airline' by a long shot but I'd fly again.

### Air Transat customer review
We flew to Vancouver it was just ok in Club TV screen on the wall no choice for a 9 hour trip. Our daughters were in coach and were cramped and hungry and couldn't see the TV so bored as well. We flew back from Calgary and the flight was worse there was still the old style TV's on the wall we were at the front so had the clatter of the kitchen throughout the night as well as the steward talking loudly about his weekend. If you wanted to use the toilet you had to walk though the kitchen and get in the stewards way Also had to ask for the toilet to be cleaned as it was disgusting. Again our well travelled daughters commented that this was the worst flight they had ever been on food awful and hard to get a drink. Would not willingly use this airline again.

### Air Transat customer review
Overnight flight from Vancouver to Manchester on an old airbus was probably the worst flight and airline my wife and I had ever been on. In flight entertainment was a single screen in the centre of the aircraft. Sound quality was atrocious with interruptions deafening static. My wife's was non functional anyway. Food was dire and by the time our turn came the main meals were gone and we had to have the vegetarian. No apology just this is it. Tray was practically thrown at us (including breakfast). Rudest cabin crew ever - they kept knocking my wife's seat without apology and when one deigned to speak said "oh has that never happened to you before". The lights were never dimmed for an overnight flight and the only sleep we did manage was interrupted by the duty free selling pre-empted by the usual seat bumping. This is the first and last time we would use this airline and would not recommend it to anyone. Old aircraft and rude staff - never again.

Toronto Pearson - London Gatwick TS322 May 29 2013 Economy. Return London Gatwick - Toronto Pearson TS723 June 10 2013 Economy. Flight from Toronto to UK was terrible - no TV's besides ones in middle for all. Flight from UK back to Toronto I was seated in the middle section which seats 3 I had my boyfriend on my left and suddenly a large man sat on my right. Within the next 20 mins of being seated I was very uncomfortable and asked to be moved. I moved for the next 8 hours. Not only did I have to move seats I was also not able to sit next to my boyfriend as was booked. My experience was unacceptable and unfair.

### Air Transat customer review
Never having been on a long haul flight before I was dreading the experience especially having read some derogatory reviews. I was delighted with the plane the staff the food and the entertainment. My first long haul from Glasgow to Calgary and then return from Vancouver were faultless and I would not hesitate to travel Air Transat again.

### Air Transat customer review
Recently travelled from Manchester to Vancouver and return. We were concerned after reading some reviews. However all our worries were groundless flights were on time staff courteous and efficient service and food excellent. Not having individual TV screens was mildly inconvenient but we knew that was the case when we booked. We would not hesitate to travel with Air Transat again and shall recommend.

### Air Transat customer review
We flew Manchester to Toronto then back again an ancient A310 going out and a A330 on return both were cramped uncomfortable planes. No personal entertainment screens limited leg room and narrow seat width annoying things like arms rest that wouldn't fold out the way and limited toilets meaning long queues in the aisles. Our return flight was delayed for an hour on the ground while maintenance were on board then we had to fly a different route back as the problem wasn't resolved which resulted in being an hour and a half late. While on the Tarmac no drinks were served I had to ask twice for some water for my 4yr old it took 30 mins for them to bring him a glass. Seats were incredible uncomfortable and we couldn't wait to get off the plane. The food was appalling. The cabin crew were rude and we could hear them gossiping about other passengers on board as they walked past. Everything seemed like a problem for them.

### Air Transat customer review
YYZ (Toronto) to Rome Italy. We have flown with them many times and once again we had a great experience. We have flown them we have gone Club class but for the second time we went option plus for this trip. It cost $130 per person return and it was well worth it for our 8.5 hour flight. You get your choice of seat when you book choice of meal before economy class and many small perks. When we went to Mexico the cost was $80 again worth it. Every time we have flown Air Transat we have had a great flight and service and we will continue to fly with them if the price and location is right!

### Air Transat customer review
My wife and I travelled return from Toronto to Gatwick London. Left on 4 Juen 2013 returned 16/06/13. We were very pleased with the flights and service. The seats were a bit cramped but satisfactory for the journey. The food was good enough and the service excellent. Nice  pleasant cabin crew. Check in was fast and efficient friendly counter staff at Gatwick. Planes were in good condition and have a very pleasing interior. We would definitely fly Air Transat again.

### Air Transat customer review
Amsterdam to Vancouver and vice versa in May-June 2013 in the new furnished plane. We travelled economy and pre- booked Option Plus and made reservations for the duo seat in the back of the plane row 44 which is directly behind the last row of 3 seats. This gives you more room on the isle side which is very comfortable. Option plus gives you a lot of pleasant privileges: a bottle of Prosecco per person first choice of hot meal snacks from the bistro menu comfort kit. Staff was very friendly both ways and seats are better then we expected. They offered enough drinks more than we needed and we have had more than enough to eat. Very recommendable airline especially if you consider the prices compared to other airlines.

### Air Transat customer review
My wife and I recently took flight TS296 and TS297 from Calgary to Glasgow and return we would like to say the flights were excellent from check in to landing on both flights. The new cabin lighting and design made the flights more relaxing. We will definitely fly with them again.

### Air Transat customer review
Toronto to Athens May 26/13 - Checked in online a few hours before flight. No good seats left (our fault due to late check in) check in at airport went off fast and effortlessly. Older plane with no individual screens. Row 27 (middle) right at the washrooms. The meals (3 choices) and service were good. Seats were comfortable enough. Entertainment was fair. Return was the same style of plane (Row 24 window this time). No individual screens. Meals (3 choices) and service were good. My only complaint is Air Transat really should be using the newly configured planes for all the long haul flights over 6 hrs. It would make the very long flights more enjoyable.

### Air Transat customer review
Flew from BHX to YYZ on A310 had read some very negative reviews about the airline and aircraft so was very nervous about what to expect. But overall it was a good pleasant flight definitely more value for money as the fare was really cheap. Just like any other North American carrier the service and cabin wasn't what you find on Asian or European carriers but having said that the crew certainly made up for it with a great friendly attitude. Being a dual national I travel to Canada every year and have used AC/BA in the past but will certainly try to book with AT the next time.

### Air Transat customer review
My wife and I have just returned from a holiday in Canada. This was our first trip to Canada which was great and our first experience of Air Transat which was not so great. Unfortunately my wife is Coeliac so therefore needs a gluten-free meal. Despite having requested and received confirmation from our travel operator that gluten free meals would be provided on both the outward bound and return flights these did not materialise. At the Air Transit check-in desks we asked the attendants if the requested gluten-free meals were on board and both times we were told no. One individual even suggested that we should just go and buy something. It is time that Air Transat and in our experience most other airlines take these requests seriously and act responsibly.

### Air Transat customer review
On the outgoing trip from Toronto to Gatwick all was well we got bumped up to Club class. Return trip was not so good. We flew home from Glasgow on one of the ancient A310's the staff were very good but the plane was cramped. We did not have individual screens for the entertainment on a flight that long passengers should have a choice on what to watch. The food was awful I am not even sure what it was they served. It's time Air Transat got rid of those relics and updated their fleet.

### Air Transat customer review
We flew YYC to AMS in May. Our flight was on time and boarding was painless. Seats in front on the way over were middle seats new cabin. They were average. On the way back we had rear seats row 41 by the window. There was lots of room and the wider aisle was great! It seemed that everyone forgot there were washrooms at the back because there was not a lot of traffic. Meals were what you would expect. We bought option plus and enjoyed pre boarding first choices and quick baggage. Return trip was in an older plane but fairly comfortable would fly with them again. For the money and lack of a stopover it was worth it.

### Air Transat customer review
May 19 2013 Cuba to Montreal. My vacation started well but ended in a nightmare. First the check-in went wrong. We travelled as a couple paid for a VIP check-in and entered the line-up in the middle of the pack but for some reason we were the last 2 passengers to get our boarding pass. We couldn't even get seats next to each other. I tried to speak with an agent on board to see if we could be relocated to sit together but no one seemed to care. Onboard the service was horrible. Always were the last ones to be served and I couldn't even order a sparkling wine chips or chocolate because flight attendants were too busy attending to other passengers or attending the option plus passengers first. The overall experience was very disappointing with Air Transat. Will not book with this carrier anymore nor recommend it to anyone.

### Air Transat customer review
My trip was from Montreal Pierre-Elliot-Trudeau to Puerto Plata Dominican Republic. I had to fly what I thought was the oldest Airbus A310. The seats were okay if you're under 5 ft 10. Being over 6ft I thought it lacked some room. The in-flight entertainment was poor an old and boring movie. The food was bad but typical of what you normally get on a plane (barely enough to get you alive in fact). The departure wasn't on time in Montreal we lurked around the airport for more than an hour for some reason. The staff is fair. Would recommend if you're poor and stingy like me. You can have better if you pay more to another airline.

### Air Transat customer review
Just returned from Montreal and had a wonderful experience with Air Transat! We were supposed to fly with A310 but got the newest A330 instead! New plane with comfortable wide seats new ipad style screens good luggage compartments! The staff were helpful and assisted us with everything nicely the food was what you typically get on the plane the flight started on time the boarding and check in ran smoothly. Nothing else to wish for. For the price paid (199) it was an excellent transatlantic journey for me.

### Air Transat customer review
Booked in August 2012 to fly from Manchester to Toronto in May 2013 for our honeymoon. Air Transat called in March 2013 to inform us that our Manchester flights had been cancelled and we could only fly from Gatwick on those dates. No apology was given no offer of compensation or even transport to and from Gatwick. We were then offered alternate dates to fly to from Manchester which we took. Upon check in at Manchester it became apparent the seats we had booked had been changed due to the change in dates after some discussion we were offered extra legroom seats for free which were excellent. The flight took off and landed on time it was an old plane with shared screens playing videos during the flight. The food was edible and came with a very small glass of wine. The return flight which was also on time was a refurbished plane with new leather seats and personnel touch screens. If they hadn’t cancelled our flights I would have given them an excellent rating for the price but I would not trust making expensive holiday arrangements that rely on one of their flights again following this experience.

Return trip to Edmonton from Cancun. On our way to Cancun departing the Edmonton Airport we were 6 kg underweight. However departing Cancun on April 28th was an entirely different experience. The staff member weighed our luggage and told us we were overweight by 8 kg. We did not do any shopping and did not purchase any items on our trip our sole purpose of our trip was to get married. I was told there was no one I could speak with and if I wanted to make a complaint I would have to pay and conveniently make the complaint once I was back in Canada. We departed with less items then we came with and were being told we were over our limit. We were unable to weight our bags again and ended up paying $60. I feel we were targeted and forced to pay for something non- existent. I made a complaint upon landing in Edmonton last night.

### Air Transat customer review
I thought they did fine until it came time to leave Cancun. The bus trip which was also organized by Air Transat was only supposed to take an hour and a half which ended up taking 2. After being late to get to check in I was told that I would have to either return to the back of the check-in line to remove my camera bag or pay $30 extra. I was told they would not check my luggage if I attempted to remove anything at the counter. When I questioned their logic and explained the situation with the late bus I was given a sneer and a sassy comeback. So all in all it left a bad taste in my mouth about them.

### Air Transat customer review
LGW to Toronto I was very impressed. When booking I was a little apprehensive about using Air Transat for a business trip I needn't have been. The experience was exactly the same as national flag carriers who were 3 times the price. The planes were on time and were modern. Good in seat entertainment and the crews were professional and courteous. Most of the plane was made up by large holiday groups of retired people who were very friendly and well behaved. Not like your average business trip with grumpy middle age executives in a hurry. I will definitely use Air Transat again for trips to Canada and may consider using them for connections into the US.

### Air Transat customer review
Rome to Toronto. Only some small things irritated me: whilst sleeping and listening to music using their entertainment system the announcements which were much louder than the music would often cut in and rouse me from my sleep. Extra problematic was having to listen to it again when repeated in two other languages. Other problems with the entertainment system was having to watch ads in the beginning of all videos and the awful picture quality.

### Air Transat customer review
Made quite a few flights with the airline the new refurbished fleet definitely makes the flights better. Check- in staff are good FA's are usually nice. The meals are good. I still feel like they could give more legroom the long haul flights are really tough to sit through. The TV features movies and TV shows and in the refurbished planes its in the seat in front of you.

### Air Transat customer review
We travelled as a group of 2 couples from Toronto to Punta Cana in early February. In spite of the stormy weather flight was only delayed for 90 minutes and that was due to de-icing the plan. Seating was cramped and leg-room was sparse. Service was friendly and food was served efficiently. Return one week later was much better. The plane was larger and the seats were wider and provided extra leg room. Only one option for food by the time that the servers came to our seats. The in-flight movie was poorly timed and had to be shut off before the end to prepare for landing.

### Air Transat customer review
LGW-YYC return. 2 hours late leaving LGW due to water leak on time returning. IFE good food very average my wife had no main meal on the return as vegetarian choice had run out. Not impressed by the 3-3-3 seating. Cabin crew very good both ways. We had these flights as part of a tour so no choice of Airline. They would have to be very much cheaper than AC or BA to be our first choice.

### Air Transat customer review
Took a Christmas flight from London to Vancouver. This is the second time I have flown with the airline. I travelled on a newly refurb plan. I travelled with my family and we had a baby and paid additional money for the bassinet seat at the front. I really can't say one nice thing about this flight. The lighting is awful fluorescent mood lighting which appear not to work and was directly over the bassinet no method to dim. Seat arms are solid and could not be lifted up (unique to the front row middle) which is crazy. In addition all the galleys have been removed so there is one at the front and back with just row after row of seats. I fly a lot long haul and typically you have some space to stretch your legs or stand around. Not with this config. Food - rubber pasta with cheese sauce - this was not even edible. One positive point is they are cheap you do get what you pay for.

### Air Transat customer review
I have flown with Air Transat many times as they are the only airline to fly direct from Manchester to Toronto. Now at the time of writing - 7th February 2013 - I am booked to fly with them on 15th May 2013 and back again on the 30th May 2013. So anything I put here carries the caveat that it may all go pear shaped at a later date. Having said that though it's a case of so far so good. I have never had a problem as yet. The flights have left and departed on time I have enough leg room and the seats are certainly big enough for me - an average sized person. The aircraft's are clean and tidy and I have found the food always to be hot and tasty. You only have to pay for alcohol from the bar but what the heck you get complimentary wine with the meal. Staff are friendly and helpful. The entertainment can be a bit iffy at times but they are upgrading the entire fleet so teething problems are to be expected. I always take my iPod and a book just in case - it's just a matter or preparation. I would recommend Air Transat to anyone. The planes I have flown on are always full so they must be doing something right.

We flew from YYZ-Santa Clara Cuba-YYZ. Jan 26 2013. Flights were on time for departure even left a few minutes early. Was given a choice of hot dinner wine with dinner and bar service the option plus is a treat for extras blanket headsets extra kilos and champagne bottle as welcome drink. On both flights the crew were professional and attentive. Both aircraft's were clean and comfortable. I will fly Air Transat again!

Flew Toronto to Gatwick January 24 return on 31 January. Both ways very good flight. Outbound aircraft had the mood lights that's the plus point. My reading light was on all the way so the crew offer me an eye shade. Food and entertainment ok for 6 plus hours. Return same as excellent crew offered extra food and soft drinks. Value for the money paid only $640.

We flew from Calgary to London Gatwick. The plane was old the seats were cramped and my seat had no working entertainment I had no music no movie no reading material. Sleep was impossible and we flew over night. The staff tried to help no but one returned to say if the entertainment could be repaired at my seat. Finally they told me it did not work but I could move - away from my wife which is not acceptable to me. I have never been so relieved to reach a destination. My patience was wearing thin. Never again.

We flew with our 7 year old daughter from London Gatwick to Toronto on January 10 2013. This was the last leg of our World Trip and we had travelled on 9 different airlines as we travelled around the world and were now heading home on a Canadian carrier. Terrible! That is the word to describe the rude service of the staff on board. The airline claims it was voted as the number one Leisure Airline in the world. How can that be? They charge you for everything on board and when you ask for something the first thing they tell you is that there will be a cost involved. Enough already! We know just sell me the item I ask for. I will never fly with them again.

Flew from Toronto to Glasgow on Jan 09 returning Jan 24. Online booking and check-in was flawless but no online check in for return flight from Glasgow. Schedule was well met in both cases and meals were as good as you would expect to get on any airline indeed much better than some of the majors we have flown on. Both aircraft were clean and comfortable enough for a transatlantic flight. With one exception concerning car rental through AirTransat which I will deal with directly everything was perfectly acceptable and value for monies paid.

I flew option plus from Calgary to London Gatwick on December 19. Flight delayed due to weather in Vancouver and our flight crew being stuck there but staff kept us informed and when the crew did show up they were apologizing to all the passengers waiting. Flight was great with all the extras included in the upgrade very much worth the cost for the option plus! Flight back also delayed and it was over booked upon check in they asked if I would fly back the next day. Air Transat counter was a bit out of the way at Gatwick but was posted and easy to find. I received a complementary upgrade to business class on the way home which was a real treat on a long flight! Overall very happy with the service food entertainment and seat! I had a new plane going an old plane on the way back and overall for the low cost in comparison to other airlines I would recommend it to anyone!

Flew Gatwick to Toronto on 7 Jan 2013 (TS623) economy. Flight was busy and left a few minutes late. Attendants were good and was food was for the most part edible. Plane did not feature their full entertainment - however it had USB charging facilities. Seats were a little tight (9 abreast on an A330) - but tickets were cheaper than other carriers. The outgoing flight (on 16 Dec) was on one of their refitted planes which offered better seating and entertainment although featured similar identifiable meat for dinner! Lights not fully dimmed despite it being an overnight flight - which was rather frustrating!

### Air Transat customer review
London to Toronto with a connection with Westjet to Winnipeg. The long haul flight was cramped with virtually no leg room - the person to my right was very tall and he had to lean over me to fit into his seat. The inflight entertainment was a little TV screen that showed an old movie food was not the best but to be fair all economy food is mediocre at best.

### Air Transat customer review
UK-Calgary-UK. Seating cramped no water in toilets to wash on return flight. Wanted payment for pillow and blankets (credit card in CAN$ only). 3 hours late going out one hour late on return. Food mediocre service mediocre stingy on offering water and juice. Will not fly again with them and will not recommend them.

### Air Transat customer review
The staff at the boarding gate were very rude. Seats extremely uncomfortable! Food was terrible. Drinks were only offered when food was brought around. Inflight entertainment did not work on the flight from Europe to Canada (a very long flight with no entertainment). Return flight sound quality was so poor you could not stand to listen to it anyhow. Customer service took over 2 months to respond to my complaints. They made an unscheduled stop and as far as I am concerned if I pay the extra money for a direct flight I expect to get a direct flight!

### Air Transat customer review
Excellent flight from YYZ-CDG and the staff were great. Flying back from GLA-YYZ was the worst experience. The same bag I carried on the flight to CDG and then from CDG to LHR I was told it was too heavy to be a carry on and that I was only allowed one carry-on despite the fact my other 'carry-on' was a laptop bag in clear contradiction with their posted signage. I was fobbed off with 'corporate policy'. Leaving GLA their entertainment was still shown on a tube TV and they didn't stock a single vegetarian meal leaving a half- dozen people eating extra loaves of bread - which were stale.

### Air Transat customer review
Manchester to Toronto October 23rd Must be the worst Airline l have travelled on. Very little space food was awful entertainment screens are still in the middle of the plane staff just did not seem interested and just to make matters worse they tell you that this airline has won awards in Canada. Never again.

GLA-YYZ and return a week later. Outbound flight delayed by 20 mins because of no-shows we were informed. Very hot cabin. Airbus A310 was full not much legroom in my middle seat. Service was standard smooth flight pilot pointed out Greenland as we flew over. Return was also full very chatty attendant who must have mentioned that we were going to arrive ahead of schedule in GLA about 10 times before take-off! Also informed that we were flying on the day of Air Transat's 25th anniversary. A bit more legroom this time (different A310 maybe?) again service was fine slept for a few hours and awoke to landing in fog in GLA smooth despite this. Transat are the only operator to fly this route direct and that's why I booked. Actually flew home a week earlier than originally booked and had to pay full price but this is explained when purchasing so can't complain.

Flew Club Class from Toronto to Madrid. Sep 23/2012 back on Oct 15/2012. Booked Row 1 and despite what seat guru says it is a bulkhead both ways can't straighten legs. Service was fine. Even though we had booked direct Madrid to Toronto they changed schedule days before we left to have a stop in Montreal with a plane change. When we got on new plane our seats were taken by Transat crew going to Toronto which reluctantly moved. Frustrating to fight for your seat after a 8 Hour flight.

### Air Transat customer review
We booked a flight from Newcastle Airport to Toronto Pearson. Check-in was smooth even though we had to wait half an hour after the scheduled check-in opening time. Boarding was relatively smooth as many people didn't know where the gate was. Departure screens were all broken so people only found out 10 minutes later. Once settled in we had very attentive service from the cabin crew. The food (pasta and beef) was nice but the pasta was slightly bland. We also had a pizza which tasted nice. In-flight entertainment was a shared TV screen but it was fine for the 7 hour flight. Also to mention they need more toilets for economy passengers as 4 toilets for over 200 people isn't good enough. Flight was enjoyable but they newer planes with individual TV screens for everyone.

### Air Transat customer review
2 days prior to my departure I received I voice mail message from Air Transat to saying I was being downgraded to Economy class from the club class seat I had booked and been confirmed on 6 weeks earlier. Told it was due to plane reconfiguration. They were offering a $230 refund even though the upgrade cost almost $400 and a seat in economy. However they only had 2 seats available the in the very last row of the plane. I had no other choice than to cancel my travel plans due to what I was being offered. I guess the airline thinks that because they are the only direct flight to Manchester customer satisfaction is not important. Next time I will choose another Airline even if it requires a connecting flight.

### Air Transat customer review
We flew from Gatwick to Montreal on 1 Oct 2012. It was an old airbus. We were economy and for nearly 250 people 4 toilets were available as club class had their own. About two hours into the flight two toilets blocked and were unable to be used. Then another toilet blocked leaving just two toilets for all economy passengers. People complained as we had to queue and wait for nearly 20-25 minutes to use a toilet. Staff were pretty rude to a number of passengers who complained to them direct. It was agreed that the club class toilet could be used by those in economy. Our flight back we flew club class we checked in on 14 Oct at Montreal all seemed to be ok just as we were leaving the desk the operator requested our documents back again and removed two bar codes from them and put two others in their place. We asked if there was a problem with her doing this but she told us no all right now. We arrived at London Gatwick on Monday morning to find that all baggage we had thought was on the flight wasn't.

Club Class Toronto to Paris Frankfurt to Toronto. I have no issues regarding the non-renovated A330-300 in which we flew Toronto to Paris - having two Club Class lavatories on this plane was very nice service and food were excellent and flight attendants great. Our flight from Frankfurt back to Toronto was one of the older A310-330 which was a complete embarrassment and insult to the whole Club Class experience. The condition of this old A310 has almost completely turned me off ever flying Air Transat Club Class again. For two passengers I paid a fair bit of money for the Club Class experience on this flight only to find that my headrest had become detached and was falling off the back of my seat. The armrests on both of our seats were worn bare and ripped from use looking tacky and shabby. The seat ahead of me was not secured properly and as a result had twisted sideways into my seating area. The seats were worn and uncomfortable for this 9 hour flight. Come on Air Transat! Not having power ports personal seatback video screens and air flow regulators is not acceptable when flying in this day and age. The shabby-looking cabins are not helping either.

Flew Rome-Montreal on the 8th of October. Although I was satisfied overall with the flight I must warn people to be on the look out for flight schedule change without notice. My flight was advanced by 2 hours and I was never notified. I found out by chance and luckily was at the airport over 3 hours in advance. This not acceptable. People could easily miss their flight and be left stranded. Lack of consideration.

### Air Transat customer review
My husband and I travelled to and from Canada last month flights on time. However we found the seats very cramped and aisles extremely narrow. The food was poor complementary glass of wine amounted to 100ml. - with no top-up offered! It was not possible to tell the seniority of the cabin crew as no badges were visible and no distinction of uniform was evident. On our return journey which was overnight the lights were left on most of the time - not conducive to sleep. We have both travelled economy class before with other airlines and had better service than we experienced with Air Transat.

Our many previous trips to Vancouver were via Canadian Affair and Thomas Cook flights. This year when six of my family over the space of a few days flew to Vancouver for our eldest son's wedding we used Air Transat. Paid for seats were changed return flights changed from direct to one stop and one flight cancelled all together. The staff on the way out were fine although the food was indifferent. On the return journey we queued almost two hours to check our luggage in. The meal which was served some 2.5hours after take off (touchdown in Calgary delayed this) was down to a choice of one by the time it reached us. It was something we didn't like and it was basically take it or leave. No offer of even crisps or chocolate instead. We had to wait a further six hours before getting a small croissant and yoghurt. The cabin staff couldn't have cared less. Will we use Air Transat again. A resounding no.

Club class from Toronto to Dublin and back in Sep 2012. To DUB was in second row and could not see drop down screen at all. Did not eat dinner which was served at 10.30 at night. Seat comfortable enough for sleeping. Breakfast consisted of a hard roll and fruit. The FA's did not know how to make a good cup of tea. Began to wonder about the wisdom of paying extra for Club class. But on the way back-what a difference! Individual television sets. I was in row 1 and could stretch my legs out straight. Started with champagne before takeoff then drinks after take-off meal service with wine (I picked my choice 45 days before) after dinner drinks chocolate bars and pringles Irish coffee light lunch before landing warm cookies and finally chocolate. Seat even had an electrical plug. Club class includes complimentary blanket pillow ear buds hot wipes etc.

### Air Transat customer review
Economy class from Gatwick to Vancouver and back and was pleasantly surprised. I was fortunate to have planes with seat-back televisions and found a decent amount of films/TV shows/audio etc but no games. I'd say the food wasn't the best airplane food I'd tasted but there are opportunities to buy food at the airports before boarding. If you're over 5ft 10ins tall and the person in front of you reclines their seat you'll feel a bit squashed. Cabin crew on both trips were professional hard-working and friendly and bearing in mind the reasonable cost of the tickets I'm satisfied with the service and would use Air Transat again.

### Air Transat customer review
The ticket I had was the seasonal charter from Glasgow-Calgary on the A330-200. I was in club class and I thought the service was excellent plus I was in the new cabin C-GITS and it was a wonderful environment with friendly crew the price was £350 for 3 weeks with return!

### Air Transat customer review
We booked Club class for our trip to Italy September 7 2012 because of the added comfort level on a longer overnight trip. We were devastated by the transformation from the old Cub to the new Club class. The seats were very uncomfortable there were more seats added to the cabin and the service was anything but good. On the way home September 28 2012 we were treated to the old Club class on a plane that had not been refurbished. The difference was amazing - smaller amount of club seats much more comfortable and roomier seats with absolutely great service. Change is not necessarily progressive in this case it was just discomfort with poor service at a higher price.

### Air Transat customer review
YYZ-GLA-YYZ on a 310. Found the 2 wide seats near the rear to have greater pitch and width. Good value for $40. Planes were clean staff hard working and pleasant. Eastbound arrived 1 hour early. Westbound delayed for 2.5 hours due to a mechanical but were kept updated frequently. All in all good value.

### Air Transat customer review
Flew Toronto-Amsterdam return with 4 month old baby. Great service both ways! Young flight crew aboard outbound flight preferred older crew on return - but no complaints. Bottles were warmed upon request. Plane was not full so we were given a seat for my daughter to sleep in and she slept the whole way! Smooth and comfortable flights always on time or early. This is my fourth time flying AT from Toronto to Amsterdam and have never had a bad experience with them! Have flown Club Class as well before definitely worth it! Private washroom for club class only much better food free drinks and one flight attendant for club class only.

### Air Transat customer review
YYZ-FRA. Toronto to Frankfurt was an A330 with the old set up. Sat in Seat 4A which is an extra leg room seat. I am 6'5" and was able to stretch my legs straight. The seats are narrow but otherwise comfortable. Cabin crew friendly and helpful. The food was good. if you want great service and amazing food spend the extra couple hundred dollars and fly with a different airline. There were recent movies played on the screens but had a tablet and watched my own. We left slightly late and arrived in Frankfurt almost 45 minutes early. On the Return flight from Frankfurt we had an A310 with the old configuration. I saved about $300 per ticket (bought 2) and I will defiantly fly with Air Transat again. If you want all the bells whistles and comfort then spend the extra money but I just saved $600 and had a comfortable flight to Europe.

### Air Transat customer review
My husband and I travel at least twice per year on Air Transat of all the times we have traveled together there has been only once or twice that we have been seated together all other times I am seated either at the back of the plane my husband in front or the other way around. My husband and I just returned from Rome Italy on Sept. 8/12. We both speak Italian at the check in counter we asked if we could sit together and were told sure since we were one of the first to check in got the boarding passes did not look at the seat number assuming we were seating together when we got onboard we found out my husband had a window seat and I was seated across the aisle. So bottom line no matter if you pay extra or not you are not assured your seat selection. Is it to much to ask if anyone is travelling as a group / family to start their trip together.

### Air Transat customer review
Booked the ticket from Montreal to Lisbon in Mid-March for a late August Flight. At the time there were much cheaper tickets with Air Canada and Lufthansa but since Air Transat was the only one with direct flights we opted for it. We even paid more for advance seat selection and leg room. Two weeks to our flight time we received an e-mail from Air Transat that our direct flight now has a stopover in Porto and our original flight time of 7.5 hours is now almost a 10 hour flight. We contacted Air Transat and told them that we are willing to stay an extra day in Lisbon and even pay for our hotel stay ourselves but come back with a direct flight the next day. Even though they had plenty of room in the next day flight they told us that we have to pay $150 each for the change and even that would not guarantee they wont change seats and schedule on us again. The reservation and operation staff were extremely rude and unsupportive. The flights were late on both departure and return flights by 50 minutes and an hour respectively. The plane was ok on our departure but on our return flight it was the oldest Airbus that I have ever seen with the smallest and most uncomfortable seats to match it. Unless the ticket price is very cheap stay away from this airline.

### Air Transat customer review
Never again will I fly with Air Transat. I purchased my ticket on June 26 to fly in club class from Toronto to Lisbon - flight taking place Sep 9 (direct). 2 days before my departure I received an e-mail stating that my flight was going to make a stop in Madrid. Explanation: charter companies can and will do that. Just be forewarned. On my way to Lisbon I also was - without prior notification from the airline - "bumped" since they suddenly did not have enough club class seats and was put into an economy seat. I found this out as I entered the plane and went to my seat. This is unacceptable. If they do not have enough club class / first class seats they should not have sold me this ticket in the first place.

### Air Transat customer review
Flew Club class Manchester to Toronto. Difficult to fault. Smooth instant check in comfortable seat with plenty of room and pleasant flight staff. Food was plentiful and good as we're the drinks. Only niggle was that there was no choice of meal as only one was left by the time we were served. Didn't really matter as what we got was good. Landed on time and luggage first off as promised. I recommend this airline without hesitation if choosing club class.

### Air Transat customer review
Madrid to Montreal and then back from Toronto in August. Bought Option Plus but we were upgraded free to Club both ways. Club is really a "quality economy" in-flight service with a bigger seat. Slightly annoying IFS schedule on the way back - with a cold snack served something like 90 mins after take off making a decent block of sleeping hours impossible which is a killer on a transatlantic flight leaving at 11pm. Breakfast was surprisingly good however and rather well done although the airline doesn't seem keen on serving bread rolls. Complimentary drinks were a little thin on the ground on the return but staff were approachable and attentive both ways. Seating if a bit tired was fine too with good space. Never bother with IFE but it looked basic - overhead screens and that's that. Check-in via priority desk was instant outbound all went to time return delayed for an hour thanks to an unexplained non-existent plane. Luggage (tagged priority) came through very quickly at both Montreal and MAD T1.

### Air Transat customer review
Flight on time old A310 seating very cramped no AVOD. Food quite poor service from crew OK but nothing more. Price of ticket not cheap but direct flight from YUL to LIS makes this service bearable and with some value.

### Air Transat customer review
We travelled from Birmingham to Toronto in May in Club Class. The flight out was very good but on return the service was very poor. When the staff got to us they had run out of food options and we were told we only had the vegetarian option available. The attitude of the cabin crew was almost insulting and we told them so at the end of the flight.

### Air Transat customer review
LGW-YYZ YYZ-LGW Staff were rude especially at the boarding gate. Flight was full very cramped and staff only came round at meal times to offer drinks there were no other drinks offered and the food was terrible. I was not satisfied with the service so will not fly with them again.

### Air Transat customer review
LGW-YYZ Non stop flight on Airbus 310. Very long walk to airport check in from entrance. Initially I was unable to find check in desks. After about 10 minutes of looking around I notice a sign pointing to a back corridor. Check in was fast and efficient. My bag was 2kgs over but the agent did not charge me. Flight departed late but the pilot made up time in air. Flight was full except for a few open seats. About an hour in the air we were provided with a complementary meal and non-alcoholic drink. Every so often the flight attendants came around with water tea and coffee. Since this was one of their older aircraft there was TVs every few rows. I did not like any of the inflight movies so I read my book instead. Overall I was satisfied with the service I received. Will use them again in the future.

### Air Transat customer review
This summer flew Frankfurt to Calgary in economy on the new A330 and it was a real pleasure. Comfortable seats more leg room and the personal LED screens and entertainment available was excellent. The new cabin lighting was soothing. I've travelled Air Transat many times on their older aircraft's - very cramped and just ok. I will definitely fly with them on long hauls again as long as its on the new planes!

### Air Transat customer review
MAN-YYZ return. Offered vouchers as overbooked on outward journey (Manchester to Toronto). Were told that they are frequently overbooked and look for volunteers to go a different day. Refused and checked in regardless. Airbus A330 both ways but not the same plane set up. MAN to YYZ - leather seats but no IFE. Good food and cheery cabin crew. Check-in line was long but moved swiftly. YYZ to MAN - Ridiculous check-in line with flights to Paris and Frankfurt also in same line (Why?) very very poor elderly looking plane needed refurbishing seats at the end of their life span. Ran out of food by my seat (43F). Both ways on time YYZ to MAN actually arrived ahead of time but was forced to wait for an airbridge. Only airline flying MAN to YYZ but aircraft both ways needed updating.

### Air Transat customer review
Travelled in club class Gatwick to Vancouver on old plane had big reclining seats so legroom was great. Entertainment poor made to watch a single overhead screen showing kids movies - tedious for 9 hr flight. Club class on return trip in the newly refurbished air bus. Modern design of seats meant that although they were fairly big they do not recline! They sort of slouch forwards. I'm 6ft 3 and had a really uncomfortable trip knees and shins on the seat in front. British Airways premium economy next time for me.

### Air Transat customer review
Flew from Toronto to Gatwick and back. Airbus A330 plane - small uncomfortable seats no individual entertainment system. The airline makes you pay to use blanket or headphone. Had a very noisy rugby team flying to London along with us whose antics added to my woes. As a vegetarian I got the exact same tasteless bland food while going and coming back. When I checked in at Gatwick for my return flight the lady at the counter surprised me by saying that only 5 kg of baggage was allowed as a handbag and that my shoulder bag now counted as an extra cabin baggage - a clear ploy to earn extra money. So my total cabin baggage now weighed in excess of 5 kg. So what did I do. I took out my jacket and put it on took out my e- reader and lo behold - my baggage now weighed less than 5 kg. So I was let in without paying any extra. All this hassle in addition to the fact that Gatwick is almost an hour long commute from central London which adds to your travel time especially when you have to catch an early morning flight.

### Air Transat customer review
Flew Toronto to Cancun Aug 19 return on the 26th. Seats were very uncomfortable. They advertise a good seat pitch which is true however the width is terrible. There was something very uncomfortable about the angle of the seat. The value of the ticket was not worth it. Back to Air Canada or Westjet for me. Food was tiny portions and not very good even though it was free. Only one movie on an overhead screen is that not flying in the 90's? The airbus 310 was ancient both ways and showed it. Staff did not hand out Mexican immigration forms that caused a great deal of lost time for all 250 people on board at the airport. Every other airline I have flown on gives all the forms needed.

### Air Transat customer review
Big difference between Club and economy. Club does not cost much and it is really similar to premium economy on other airlines but it really is worth it. This was on an aged 310 from Manchester to Toronto. We could not get club on the outward leg but did for the return. Huge difference in comfort and attention: the upgrade was only some £97 each! I am 6'2 and was very uncomfortable on the back: very comfortable in the front given the extra baggage food drink and good service the upgrade is tremendous value.

### Air Transat customer review
From Gatwick to Toronto then Toronto to Gatwick. On the flight from Gatwick to Toronto there was a change in planes after we bought the tickets and because of this had two different sets of seat numbers staff at boarding were helpful during this. Flight was enjoyable but after we left the gate the pilot said that the entertainment system didn't work so for the first 4 hours of the flight there was nothing to do after they got the entertainment system to work there was a very poor selection of movies. TV screens are 10 rows apart and no individual screens. The food was inedible. The flight was delayed but we arrived in Toronto early. Now from Toronto to Gatwick to begin with we checked in staff seemed very friendly but didn't quite know what they were doing we stood at the check in for 10 minutes while the woman serving was talking to another member of staff. We took off because it was a night take off the lights went off then the reading lights began to have a mind of there own going on and off flickering on and off. It was about 1 hour into the flight before we were offered a drink the food was even worse this time. It was impossible to sleep as the staff come around every half an hour to offer you something. Then the lights went out and it was pitch black in the cabin until we landed the reading lights worked just then landing the lights came on and flickered on and off until we got to the gate. We waited half an hour to get off the plane when we got to the gate. Then the real fun began Air Transat had lost out luggage and we are still waiting for the bags. Other times I have flown with Air Transat we have had no problems. I would not recommend them anymore.

### Air Transat customer review
Vancouver-Gatwick-Vancouver - The phrase "You get what you pay for " is right on the money for this airline. I am a small person and I felt very uncomfortable on this flight. My leg was touching the back of the seat in front of me. I wonder about those people that is 5'5 and above? The check in agent at YVR are the worst I asked if we were flying on the refurbished aircraft where you have your own TV the agent told me " I don't know. I know it's an Airbus". This airline is really strict about check in and carry on baggage. Carry on max is 5KG and min was 6KG and the agent is telling me that I need to pay extra $45 so I just told them that my laptop is in there as well and he let it go. The food was awful. I am however impressed by the flight attendants. They seem really nice and smiles all around. Bring your own food water and entertainment. Do not get an Aisle seat as you will not have a peaceful flight. Pay extra $200 and fly other airline.

### Air Transat customer review
Round Trip Toronto to Paris. Paid upgrade for seats in front economy class. Plane very dirty both ways no inflight entertainment ie: movie. Have taken many international flights most economy a few business and have never been on one where you did not have at least 1 or 2 movies plus other entertainment. The cost of AIR Transit was not any less than the other flights. I at least expect the plane to be a little cleaner and not smell like the toilets. Meals were also very marginal. Will never take again nor recommend to my friends or family. Bad trip.

I took a flight from Dublin to Toronto with Air Transat over the summer. This is my fourth year in a row with the company and they never fail to disappoint. Staff are friendly and the aircraft spotless. Definitely value for money.

### Air Transat customer review
Vancouver to Frankfurt. Even cabin staff were commenting on how narrow the aisles were. I am a large person but have never been so uncomfortable in an airline seat. The air-conditioning was on all the time and the blankets that they had were for sale and I just refuse to pay for things that should be included on a transatlantic flight. Staff were so busy trying to sell us stuff that they had no time to just attend to people's needs in the cabin. It was impossible to move because there was no way to stand up without being in someone's view of the overhead TV screens or bumping into the duty free cart. On a 12 hour flight it should be possible to stretch your legs once in a while. It's unhealthy to sit so long. No mention of the special meal I requested. I guess you get what you pay for. Although the flight came to almost $1100 at least $600 was taxes so I should have expected poor service!

### Air Transat customer review
Staff and food was great very comfortable nice amenities pack. The 310's are definitely old and tired looking but the Airbus 330 club class was the new style which was very nice except the TV screen had a mind of it's own and kept doing strange things. They definitely need to fix that. Spacious. Enjoyable flights both ways.

### Air Transat customer review
Never even got off the ground. I booked a flight from Manchester to Toronto to travel in September. Back in June the return leg of my flight was cancelled - the airline failed to inform me of this - I only found out when I checked their schedules webpage. I was moved to a flight the next day incurring an additional night's hotel charge. Now they have cancelled my outbound flight as well - again they did not inform me and I found out by checking their webpage. This time I have had enough - cancelled the whole thing and booked with another airline. It's just not worth the hassle.

### Air Transat customer review
I booked a direct flight to Greece and back to Toronto. Last minute they informed us that we had to stop in Montreal. After we were at the airport and on the plane - not only was there a stop but we had to change planes as well. If I wanted to book a connection I would have done so. Flight attendants say 'well things happen' well it seems they have been 'happening' on every flight to Greece all summer long. If you pay extra you get a pillow blanket and earphones but get rude treatment for whatever minor request you may have. I can deal with unpleasant food and I'll try to even accept that they use old planes but do not treat me like I am stupid.

### Air Transat customer review
It seems all AT flights leave London Gatwick at the same time from their own tiny row of desks in a back corridor which makes it chaotic to say the least especially as there is no online check in available from LGW. On the day we travelled every flight was overbooked so people were being strongly encouraged to accept vouchers and travel later in the week. We were not told at check in as we apparently should have been that due to a catering strike in Toronto the food quality on the flight would be greatly diminished. They weren't wrong - the worst food and the smallest amount I've ever seen. As for the complimentary glass (less than 100ml) of wine with dinner. We ordered an extra snack from the cabin crew which took over 2 hours to appear and the new seat-back video system has very few movies / shows loaded and they're definitely from the bargain shelves of the video rental stores. They've also installed the kit to run the screens underneath your seat so if you're in the habit of occasionally sitting with your feet positioned behind your knees you'll be very uncomfortable. Sometimes needs must but please find the extra and fly with a proper airline.

### Air Transat customer review
Amsterdam to Vancouver (10.5 hour flight) with Option Plus upgrade. Travelled with 6 members of family including an infant. Seats were so narrow that the flight was torturous for adults of average size. Attempted to upgrade to Club Class but were told there were only 4 seats available. Once on the plane there were at least 9 empty seats in Club Class. On board service was disorganized and poor. Asked for the baby bassinet 6 times and each time was told "Sorry I forgot". We sat in row 4 (directly behind Club Class) and there was absolutely no ventilation or air-conditioning in this section. All passengers in this section were sweating and overheating. When flight attendants were advised of the uncomfortable temperatures in this section nothing was done. Will never use this carrier again.

### Air Transat customer review
Manchester-Calgary then Vancouver-MAN. Check in queue outbound acceptable much longer and slower inbound as one queue for all flights with them at YVR. Staff attentive and meal quality and quantity outbound and return fine. Free glass of wine with main meal impressive for a predominantly leisure carrier. Outward the 5kg cabin baggage allowance strictly enforced but not on return leg. Itinerary gave 25kg hold bag allowance but on check in informed was 22kg. Amenity kits and headphones extra charge unless for minors apparently. Price paid less than other carriers at time of booking with the benefit of non stop service ex MAN although non refundable and no changes allowed. Would have no hesitation in using this carrier again and would rate better than some American carriers on transatlantic routes. Limited entertainment options as not AVOD being overhead screens.

### Air Transat customer review
My outward flight was late leaving aircraft was the newest version of the A330 complete with screens in the rear of the seat in front. However the inflight catering was abysmal tiny portions of barely adequate food. The complimentary glass of wine was almost undrinkable. The inflight entertainment was hopeless and immediately forgettable. Return flight was in the older version of the A330 with screens in the middle of the plane every ten rows. No escape from inadequate films. Trying to sleep was impossible being woken every 20/30 minutes with some announcement or other. Again there was a prohibition on the consumption of duty free drinks - alcoholic or not. However there was seemingly no limit to the amount that could be bought from the trolley as evidenced by a group of youths occupying two rows of seats. That they became loud and intoxicated seemed just to add to their enjoyment whilst annoying many others. My conclusion is that the airline has taken many an idea from Ryanair. Cheap it may be but be warned!

### Air Transat customer review
Glasgow to Toronto Return. Far better than expected. As a long term back pain sufferer I never travel any distance unless I have to. However I found this flight far more comfortable than any of the short distance flights I've taken flying from Glasgow to London the Midlands or Exeter. On this flight I walked away almost pain free. Most seats are in a 3+3+3 configuration which gives a very narrow aisle. I was careful to book an aisle seat in the rear of the cabin with its 2+3+2 configuration giving more space. The in-flight films were a bit naff but who cares. Take your own earphones if you want to watch the films. The meals were small and basic but again so what as long as the seats are good. If you want to buy anything you need a credit card as they don't take cash. A slight criticism was that I didn't realise that soft drinks were free until the return flight. Staff don't make that clear.

### Air Transat customer review
Flew from Vancouver to Paris return. Outbound flight on a newer A330 with seat back screens. Crew was attentive food and drinks plentiful. Seat was comfortable with more than adequate leg room (I am 6'2) though we did book the seats at the rear of the plane where there are only 2 rather than 3 across. Flight was delayed for 3 hours on a stop in Calgary due to severe thunder storms so no fault of the airline. Return flight on an older A330 with overhead TV screens. Movies were good crew was excellent and food and drinks were more than plentiful. For the price you cannot beat Air Transat. Will definitely fly again with them.

Travelled to Toronto club class on A310 from Glasgow in June. Check in priority boarding and all services on board were excellent. Pre-ordered meals were what I ordered as was cabin service with friendly staff. Seating was comfortable with plenty of leg room. Can't wait to try new cabin in the future.

LGW-YYZ-LGW. Flew on A330 with older Club configuration to YYV. I am a large gentleman and found the seats to be more than comfortable. Food was good and the cabin service excellent. Departed on time and arrived ahead of schedule bags were first off the carousel. Return journey on A330 with new Club class was even more comfortable the new seats and PTV are a useful upgrade. Cabin service was again great with very attentive flight attendants. Flight delayed due to weather closing the airport which is out of the airlines control. It was a little confused as we had started to board the flight before the delay was announced. But we were allowed to leave the aircraft and re-board later. Overall a very positive experience my fare was the same as a flights on BA/AC in economy so overall I found Air Transat to offer superb value for money.

### Air Transat customer review
BCN to YUL. I did not expect such a high level service from this airline after former experience. It was a real surprise. The director of the flight and all staff were friendly and attentive. The seat was comfortable with excellent leg room the food was nice and the selection of drinks was good and frequent. There were some problems with the entertainment system and a passenger who commented it to FA later was asked if a compensation can be offered to her. Very good value for money and a pleasant experience.

Dublin - Shannon - Toronto and home Toronto - Dublin. Both flights left on time but outbound we stopped in Shannon for approx. 1 hour while the aircraft was cleaned we had to leave the plane and wait in the terminal the only thing that annoyed me was the fact we had to queue again with passports etc. The IFE wasn't great had to buy headsets for the films. Should be a lot better when the aircraft get upgraded. Cabin crew are very good and pleasant for the whole flight glass of wine with meal was nice and plenty of coffee after it we paid extra for our seats 37a 38b on the A330. I'm 6 ft tall and had plenty of room well worth the extra money I would recommend bringing water with you as you have to pay for drinks and only take VISA. I will fly Air Transat again as they offer a direct service to Toronto from Dublin we flew out on a Tuesday and returned on a Tuesday as the A330 was being used and I believe is a nicer aircraft than the A310 which is much older and doesn't have the 2 -4 -2 seating configuration.

### Air Transat customer review
Considering their boasting of upgrading the fleet flight I was on was quite disappointing. If you want a half- decent seat or a realistic amount of luggage for an overseas journey or even a headset you'll have to shell out a fair bit more money. If you have to cancel for some reason you won't get any of your ticket or upgrade back. The real notable problem though is the very meagre meal service. For an 8 hour flight the meals are more the size of a snack and certainly not enough. And even if you want to buy something extra unless you have a credit care you're out of luck. The same goes for anything including headphones. The only plus was the staff who were a bit of fresh air amongst this sea of low mediocrity.

### Air Transat customer review
Manchester-Toronto-Manchester. I was pleasantly surprised at how good this airline was compared to others I have used. Both flights went well with no delays and very good service. Excellent leg room and friendly cabin crew. Inflight entertainment was poor but I believe this is being upgraded. My one criticism would be the food. I ordered a special meal but there was no record of this on the system when I checked in. I tried to contact Air Transat whilst in Canada but could only get a recorded message telling me that I should have requested this through a travel agent at the time of booking which I had done. A warning to anyone with strict dietary requirements as they state that special meals cannot be guaranteed. Vegetarian options are available as standard however the meals were rather bland and basic.

### Air Transat customer review
This airline is getting worse by the minute the flight from Manchester is always late. They can change your flight as and when but you try and make a change and there is a charge or nothing they can do. I am so sorry there is no other airline that does direct to Birmingham or Manchester as I would use them instead.

TS255 Manchester-Vancouver 19th May - old plane no individual video screens but there was more leg room than on other long haul flights we have made recently. We were 1.5 hours into our flight before we were offered a drink. Food was the worst inedible rubbish I have ever been offered on a flight no polite words can describe what it taste like just as well I wasn't hungry. Awful selection of inflight videos.

Worst airline I've flown with in a long time cheap yes but for long haul (Gatwick to Vancouver) I'd prefer to pay the extra. Food inedible I didn't have a credit card so was not able to purchase any drinks or better food (cash is not accepted) entertainment was a tiny overhead monitor every 10 or so rows which I couldn't listen to because again you needed a credit card to purchase headphones. Toilet with baby change was broken on my side of the plane and the aisle to cross over was blocked by an elastic strip so I had to walk all the way to the back of the plane and back around to change my child. Also silly rules about weight allowance distribution and general lack of help for mums travelling alone with children. Not impressed.

Manchester - Vancouver 8 June 2012 and Vancouver - Manchester 24 June 2012. Outward flight just about tolerable. Seats very narrow and very narrow gangways with 3+3+3 across an Airbus. Food what you'd expect on a cheap (ish) flight. Coming back was horrible. Arrived at Vancouver airport 2.5 hours before departure to find check-in queue already 100 metres long. Inadequate number of check-in desks trying to deal with 3 separate flights. Queue moved 10 metres in 40 minutes but then a bit quicker. Concern mounting everywhere that we would be denied boarding or that flight would be seriously delayed. No announcements no staff on hand to explain - general couldn't-care-less attitude. Asked to see check-in supervisor but she declined to appear. Finally we arrived at check-in after 90 minutes standing in the queue and saw that they had opened more desks. Further 30 minutes standing for security and we headed straight for departure lounge to find them already boarding. Miraculously flight left on time but a lot more could have been done to soothe angry passengers. Once aboard cabin crew on this flight completely cackhanded. Man next to us had chicken dinner tipped into his lap. I was hit by passing trolley at least six times because my arm was about 10 mm over the edge of the arm rest (I am 1.82 m tall and weigh 80 kg). Tonic water went down narrowly missing me but wetting floor all around. Night flight over the arctic but windows kept up all the way so no sleep possible. No long-haul flight in economy is really pleasant but this was the worst I have experienced. Schedules of this return flight were changed three times in months and weeks prior to departure. No explanation ever offered contrary to their conditions of carriage.

My 2 daughters and I from Toronto to Venice and back from Barcelona to Toronto. We did not upgrade and had great seats together to Venice. The personnel were very friendly and the service was very good. I was expecting much less and was pleasantly surprised. The food was average and a glass of wine was included. Also they were very attentive. The flight back from Barcelona was a little less comfortable as we were in row 7 by a window but the "Window" was solid at that row and jutted out a bit but the flight was so smooth and the service great that it made up for it. we just switched places a couple of times during the flight. I would definitely fly Air Transat again!

Flight: In last month. Manchester to Vancouver June 2012. Having purchased tickets at a brilliant rate I was expecting the old cliché; you get what you pay for! The reviews and comments of existing customers were leaving me with little hope of a comfortable stress free flight. I was however pleasantly surprised at the quality of the flight. I was expecting old planes with one TV for a number of passengers with old seats with minimal legroom but the outcome was the opposite. TV's in the headrests for each passenger with a small but decent selection of films to choose from clean cabins with adequate legroom. The food was ok and was on a par with other flights but drinks were regular and available on request. Overall I would definitely book with Air Transat again without a doubt.

Flight: In last 2-3 months. I fly Air Transat to Ireland or England at least twice a year. I always fly Club Class and find that it is well worth the extra cost. Club Class allows you special check in and your baggage comes out first at your destination. The Club Class cost is not much more than regular Economy in most other airlines but should not be mistaken for First Class or Business Class in other airlines. Some passengers seem to believe that the additional fare should give them much more than it actually does. Crew members are always pleasant and the service is very good. The food could be a bit better (Menu hasn't changed in at least 4 years) and movies could be a bit more recent but other than that I have no complaints. The best part is there are very rarely any delays so that is better than most other carriers.

Travelled Exeter to Toronto and was on a tight budget. Flight was very cheap in comparison with other airlines. Seats comfortable leg room not an issue for me. In flight entertainment good. Generous baggage allowance which included one on board bag plus my camera bag & handbag! Older plane but it was quite clean. Staff worked very hard were pleasant and helpful. Food was not really very good but edible. I got value for money if you expect to pay a cheap price & then get gourmet food and extra leg room do not fly Air Transat. I will definitely be flying with them again.

Flight: In last month. I travelled Club (business) class with Air Transat Paris to Montreal return. Overall the trip was great. For a price lower than economy at other airlines you get a near-business class experience: preferential boarding the trappings of personal service good food spacious seating etc. A few quibbles: oldish planes the bulkhead too close to row 1 (my case on both legs) inability to choose seat via the internet (the site was inoperative) and a blocked toilet.

Travelled to Birmingham overnight June 5 and returned June 13th. Took my 84 yr old father to see family members. Used wheelchair service for my Dad who cannot walk long distances and Air Transat always seems to be at the last gate. Service for Dad was great on both ends and the seats surprisingly comfortable. Plane was one of the older ones but was fine. Food was good service great and we had priority plus which was a pretty good deal at $49.00 each person each way. Included extra baggage champagne 2 beers and seat selection as well as priority boarding which was great for my Dad who would have suffered waiting in the Economy line. We had 8 people who requested wheel chair service in Toronto but 25 by the time we landed in Birmingham. People saw the special treatment for wheelchair people and wanted by the time we landed.

Toronto to Venice 5/25 returned Rome to Toronto 6/9. Review based on new plane for return! We were so surprised to see we had a brand new plane for our return trip - so glad we didn't have it only on the way there because we would have been very disappointed since there is no comparison! A delightful way to end a vacation! Would definitely fly Air Transat again everybody is so friendly from Airport staff to the Flight Attendants and Captains! Only glitch was when Rome Gate staff thought a backpack was too large to be a personal item (it had 2 full bottles of water and some snacks) but we were in no mood to argue about it. Some people travel with no carry ons and felt we should not have been singled out. Fortunately the carry on was checked by the gate for free and did arrive at our destination (the same bags were carried on both International and domestic legs of our trip with no problem).

Club Class YVR to Paris June 17 newer interior. Club Class is 80% of AC biz class quality at a fraction of the price (200 each way for transatlantic flight). Staff very friendly and attentive bypassed all lines like access to nexus lots of extras during the flight incl dedicated bathroom food good and presented nicely. When you consider the add ons people pay for in econ like seat selection and extras you have to pay for Club Class is (by far) the way to go from what I've seen in other reviews. I'm spending 5 figures to take a family of 4 on a one time trip to Europe so the additional cost was easily justified with the astonished look on my kids faces with the treatment we received from start to finish.

Toronto to Glasgow on June 8. Bought the ticket (family member passed away) the night before and was surprised how many seats were still available. Staff were friendly cheerful. Seats were large enough even for my ample bottom. The food was as expected just palatable but there were 4 choices and the meals were hot. I'd suggest bringing ear plugs as they are not available on board and should you have a family of screaming kids for the entire flight (as we did) you will need them. The staff although friendly gave no suggestions or assistance to the screaming children. I must admit that thankfully not all children were unhappy mine was kept entertained with electronics I brought with us and there were many others that were wonderful travelers. The flight left and arrived on time plane was clean staff was friendly. Only downside was limited number of toilets. Would travel with them again.

Booked family of 4 trip to Birmingham UK - requested a vegetarian meal for myself but couldn't do that until we had reserved seating @ $25/pp both ways - another $200 over and above what seemed like reasonable fares - only to find on board a vegetarian meal is standard offer as part of the meal! The plane to UK was extremely old and the seating very cramped - we were exhausted by the time we reached our destination. On our return flight the plane was a newer model and the seating we had selected was nothing in comparison to the layout online - although alot more comfortable than before. The inflight entertainment was not well placed as the screen was either too close for proper viewing or too far which my younger child was unable to view due to the seat in front of him.

YVR-LGW-YVR. Checked in online outbound which was quick and efficient. No special check-in machines at LGW but the airline has a dedicated set of well staffed check-in desks so it was quick and easy. Aircraft A300-200 were in very good condition. Booked seats ahead of time to get into the 2 abreast at the rear of the plane. Generous leg room and the wider aisle. Worth booking the seats ahead of time in spite of the fee but they are all doing that now. Started boarding well before departure which meant we were ready to go on time. Pleasant young cabin crew in both directions a refreshing change from the somewhat more mature attendants on the rival carrier. Drinks cart soon after take off. Meals not gourmet but quite adequate. Plenty of visits with drinks. Cabin crew quite attentive. Good entertainment system and a working flight map. Altogether a good flight and the price was right.

### Air Transat customer review
Gatwick to Calgary. Dirty old planes cramped lights flashing in the cabin due to fault poor screens paid for extra legroom - was cramped against a wall. Food was awful. Will never use them again. One thing to note is that the Canadians do you make you feel very welcome when you arrive. Back in the UK - not one 'welcome' in the airport by staff. All very miserable and you need a pound coin for the luggage trolley.
