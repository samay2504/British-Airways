### "a lot of waiting around"
Boarding and take-off are subject to weather conditions in the mountains, so there was a lot of waiting around in Lukla airport (which is the same for all airlines) without knowing what time we would actually depart (or if we would at all that day) as no information was provided on the ground regarding estimated flight times. Once the incoming plane arrived, boarding commenced quickly and the flight took off. Seating is unallocated (free seating), with the one restriction that minors are not allowed to sit next to the emergency exits for safety reasons.

### "Iconic scheduled flight"
Iconic scheduled flight to Tenzing-Hillary Airport in the Himalayas. Boarding at Kathmandu was very prompt. The flight itself is an experience. Fairly strict baggage weight restrictions due to the small size of the aircraft and very short landing runway. Surprisingly (given the tiny size of aircraft) there was still a member of cabin crew onboard, giving safety instructions and handing out sweets during the flight. The cockpit was openly accessible and viewable from the cabin, giving stunning views of the mountains and the landing sequence.
