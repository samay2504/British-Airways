### "I am now delayed 24 hours"
A feeder flight from Madagascar to Réunion was delayed by 1.25 hours because it was held over to pick up corresponding passengers in Mayotte and I missed by corresponding flight to Paris. The Paris flight need have only waited 15 minutes to allow our connection. I am now delayed 24 hours until the next flight. Unbelievable!

### "will never ever again book with them"
Not Verified |  Air Austral is terrible. We booked a flight to the Seychelles with a layover in La Reunion. Then they changed the first flight to one day earlier and the second flight to four days later. So we were supposed to stay 5 days in La Reunion instead of a few hours. We would loose 4 days out of 7 on the Seychelles. Of course we don’t accept this proposal. Online we just could "accept" the change. So we went to an Air Austral office to not accept and cancel this flights, that it want be a no-show. To contact Air Austral online we need to wait 20 days for an answer. The guy in the office confirmed us, that he cancelled it and we must ask for the refund on the homepage of Air Austral, what we did. So we did everything that's possible, but the answer of Air Austral is nope. They don’t give us the refund of the flights! Of course we are very upset and will never ever again book with them. What a bad service. By the way, we are frequent flyer and never had a similar issue like this.

### "RTPCR is required for children for age 5"
We reached airport with my children and they mandated to do RT PCR test to return from Mauritius to india for my children who is only 5 years old and not yet attained 6. In the website they have not mentioned that a RTPCR is required for children for age 5. When i said it is their duty to inform the passengers about the mandatory documents to carry for boarding ,they said it should be known by you. First he asked me to take RTPCR test for entire family even after i have shown him the fully vaccinated certificate. Food served in the flight from reunion to Chennai is the worst food. They changed the travel date all of a sudden. Earlier it was booked for 27 July from Chennai and then they rescheduled to 30th.

### "they did not proceed the refund"
We booked the return flights for two people last October via Opodo and couldn't go due to the Covid restriction. We cancelled the flights immediately and Opodo helped us proceed. However, the airline company Air Austral did not issue the refund even when they have confirmed the cancellation. And every time we asked about it, they threw the problem to Covid, which is not reasonable. It has been 5 months already that they did not proceed the refund.

### "no communication or support from the ground staff"
Mauritius to Madagascar via Reunion Island. The flight has been delayed from 4 to 7 and now 9.15 pm, no communication or support from the ground staff. They knew about the delay before the departure from Mauritius but did not inform the customers. Acces to lounge was given only after insistence from us and only to who has asked for it, not to all afected travelers, and no airline representative has spoken to us, as we should be grateful for the lounge access. No alternative connection was offered. Kids and old people were left without even water and waiting confused. Very unprofessional staff and airline!

### "Thoroughly recommended"
Johannesburg to St Denis. Service like it was 30 years ago, professional, attentive, amenity kit handed out on a 3 hour flight, and the quality and quantity of the catering I've not seen for years. Thoroughly recommended.

### "my flight was very unpleasant"
I have flown with the airline at least six flights in the last three years. So far, I am pleased with the airline's punctuality and the services of flight attendants on board. Unfortunately, my 2019 flight in 23 June was very unpleasant. Started from at least the 15-hour delay of the flight, and there was not at all any special offer on board. The delay caused me to pay more at the hotel. The latest flight in July was terrible. Boeing 787-8 was booked, but A330 I was in. Headache during the flight , and asked for pills from the attendant but it was ignored. Terrible.

### "leg room was not too bad"
Paris to Reunion. Air Austral is a fairly good airline. The seat layout of the Airbus A330-200 was 2x4x2. The leg room was not too bad. In-flight entertainment was good and worked well. Cabin service was average but generally fine. The flight was on time.

### "missed our connection flight"
La Réunion to Paris. We missed our connection flight because of the delay of the the first flight with Air Austral. The worst thing about was the service of the staff at the airport at CDG. At first they denied to speak English and booked us for a flight 7 hours later, but other travelers were book on an earlier flight with the same destination. Vouchers for food or drinks were also denied although it is EU law. It was the impoliteness and ignorance of the staff that made the experience with Air Austral this bad.

### "really bad service"
Reunion to Chennai. We were really disappointed in this Air austral. Around 13 hrs delay, they dint provide lounge, and food to still for 4 hours and then all complaint the ground staff and then they issue a burger and one drinks. All ground staff is not at all responding. It’s really bad service.

### "had to give up our luggage"
We had to give up our luggage in Paris CDG on the return flight from Reunion, for the onward flight to Frankfurt, although no airport change took place. Reason: The gate for the onward flight to Frankfurt was too far away from the gate where we arrived ! ! Despite a complaint about the baggage claim in St. Denis, the responsible supervisor decided that. Was an unpleasant and stressful experience. On the one hand, because of the relatively short time window and on the other hand because of the many and sometimes also heavy luggage, which we push forever through Paris CDG and also had to transport an elevator and a bus. Wir mussten beim Rückflug aus Reunion unser Gepäck in Paris CDG erneut aufgeben, für den Weiterflug nach FFM, obwohl kein Flughafenwechsel stattgefunden hat. Begründung: Das Gate für den Weiterflug nach FFM sei von dem Gate, an dem wir angekommen sind, zu weit entfernt ! ! Trotz Reklamation bei der Gepäckaufgabe in St. Denis hat der zuständige Supervisor so entschieden. War eine unangenehme und stressige Erfahrung. Zum einen, wegen des relativ knappen Zeitfensters und zum anderen wegen des vielen und teilweise auch schweren Gepäcks, das wir ewig weit durch Paris CDG schieben und zudem in einen Fahrstuhl sowie einen Bus verfrachten mussten.

### "This airline is shambolic"
This airline is shambolic. Our direct flight from Paris to Dzaoudzi was cancelled and another given after 3hours but via Reunion. On arrival in Reunion, shoved in my face a letter of apology. Agents very stand offish. Nothing offered, not even water. Crying babies, elderly customers not taken care of. Just herded like cattle to a small gate area. On embarking from Reunion to Dzaoudzi our baggage could be seen on tarmac but not loaded. Advised Purser and Captain but they shrugged shoulders. On arrival in RUN, a total of 8 hours late with no luggage. On return flight to Paris CDG we were advised maybe a stop in East Africa, then told once on plane, going direct. Served a freezing cold salad as an entree and thats all. A dry baby croissant for breakfast, but were made to feel grateful. We pay for service and products but must be grateful for something! I contacted Air Austral under EU LAW 261/2004 for my refund as laid out under EU Legislation & after 17 emails ignoring me, I contacted a third party attorney. Sure enough they are paying up my refund. I can only say, this airline is awful. They hold you to ransom after you pay your hard earned money, treat you like you are doing them a favour, glare at you when questioned, ignore the law they are contractually bound to, serve you cold salad for dinner, lose your luggage, contact you after 6 months once summoned by a lawyer, tell you where they are taking you with no chance to deplane if you need to change your plan. The situation is their Boeing 787 has many technical problems, the Boeing 777 is too big to land in Mayotte, so instead of being truthful, they just lie. Still, they are supposedly 3star?

### "Very bad attitude!"
I wasn't a happy guy. There was an outbreak of pneumonic plague and especially in Antananarivo/Tana. So, I changed my return flight to avoid Tana and instead opted for my return from Nosy Be. The agent repeatedly said there would be no change fee due to the plague. Made perfect sense to me. I wanted to avoid a plague area! When I did change they had charged me the €70 change fee and they would not budge. Very bad attitude! The flights are horrendously expensive. I mean, I could fly DUB-MRU (Mauritius) for €700 return and this hop between islands cost me close to €500 return. They seem to have the routes tied up with Air Madagascar, would I be a cynic for thinking there may be a total lack of competition between them? More competition needed her ASAP! A two-star due to the change fee and cost of the flights!

### "We were pleasantly surprised"
Flew Bangkok to Antananarivo via Saint-Denis. We were pleasantly surprised by Air Austral: the flights were on time, the aircraft relatively new, the amenities were good, and the IFE was ok. On the BKK-RUN segment, a pouch is provided with socks and eye shade in Y class. Wine is provided with meals. The staff tended to disappear after meal service, but they were friendly enough.

### "they just keep stalling"
Nosy Be (Madagascar) to Paris CDH via Reunion. The connecting flight was cancelled so had overnight stay in Reunion. Then next day flight was earlier than the original schedule, so had to overnight in Paris. The promised hotel booked by Air Austral was not honoured - had to chase to get refund for hotel booked myself. Still waiting for compensation, that was agreed by Air Austral, despite continued emails. They just keep stalling. Unfair and gives a terrible impression of Air Austral.

### "worst experience I have had"
Reunion to Johannesburg with Air Austral. One of the worst experience I have had. After we took off from Reunion, the flight had to go back to Reunion because of the technical fault. When we arrived at the airport nobody from the airline bothered to explain the next step and nobody at the airline spoke English. We only saw on the boarding gate the time for departure. This made us miss our connecting flight. Upon arrival at Johannesburg we tried to negotiate with the Manager and ask her to find flights home for us. She said there was nothing she can do for us. I can assure everybody who wants to take this airline that cheap is expensive. We ended up rebooking our flights.

### "great little airline"
Great little airline. Although we left one hour late, the service for a 4 hour flight was outstanding from Johannesburg to Reunion. Even in Economy Class, you receive an amenity kit, a hot towel, and a full hot meal with first course, desert, and free wine and liquors. This was followed by a great French movie with subtitles on drop down screens every 4 rows. A great way to start a magical vacation on a paradise destination in the Indian Ocean.

### "disappointed with my flight"
Paris to La Réunion. I was very disappointed with my flight on Air Austral - very damaged seats, small, uncomfortable, dirty. Due to health problems I have to eat neither fat nor sugar, so I always order a light meal except that Air Austral on this meal "exceptional" also has a price exceptional and is discriminatory. The meal costs the astronomical sum of 20 € for all that ultimately end up with a meal with fat! Between the outward and return flight I had email exchanges with the company following this concern and frankly they had nothing to do and were very ironic in their responses do not take seriously at all my problem, sending me a vegetarian menu instead of the light except that eating vegetarian has nothing to do with not eating fat and sugar. Staff incompetent. Movies and music were poor.

### "crew were outstanding"
A very pleasant experience with Air Austral. The food was above average for economy. The movie choice was a bit limited but there was enough in English to keep us entertained. As much to drink as you wanted. The onboard crew were outstanding - friendly and professional. The best economy cabin crew I have experienced for a long time. It is also by far the best route to Madagascar (and especially Nosy Be with a direct flight from St Denis).

### Air Austral customer review
CDG-RUN return. Air Austral is the airline of Réunion Island owned by the local public authorities. On the good side food is average but not too bad particularly main dishes. FA are smiling and very attentive ground staff really nice. Boarding was very well organised. A small travel kit is provided with socks. Pillows are wide. Cabin looks fine although a bit ageing in Y. New livery on the planes is really great. On the downside choice of films on the IFE is surprisingly limited and most French films - and seats are really narrow because of 3-4-3 configuration on B777 particularly exit seats. All in all I find its service to be slightly better than AF and Air Mauritius on this area.

### Air Austral customer review
Sydney-Reunion-CDG return May/June 2012. After reading mixed reviews here we were a little apprehensive at first but booked anyway because of price and also short stop over times. Staff were friendly upon initial check in blocking the seat next to us so we had more room. Actually the only flight we had to sit next to someone else was Reunion-CDG. Entertainment selection was great and the staff were very friendly and attentive. Food was tasty and very sufficient. And the care packs with socks ear plugs sleep mask and headphones were a nice touch. On return flight Reunion-Sydney the plane was virtually empty so we had a row of seats each as did most other passengers in the cabin. Again staff were very attentive constantly offering drinks throughout the flight. All in all we had an extremely pleasant experience and have no hesitation flying with them again. Have recommended Air Austral and will continue to.

### Air Austral customer review
Departed Jorge Newbury Airport (AEP) Buenos Aires to Galeão-(GIG) Rio de Janeiro. Flight number AR 2252- 22 August 2012. Embraer 190 aircraft. Arrived at the airport in time for a 9.50am departure. There were many announcements in Spanish but very few in English until English speaking passengers enquired at departure gates. Flight was 1 hour late with no explanation given. Flight itself was fantastic however cabin crew were less than friendly and did not even check our boarding pass to direct us to our assigned seat as we boarded. Inflight "snack" was some sort of carrot cake caramel filled biscuit covered in a white chocolate substance with a caramel sweet.

### Air Austral customer review
Sydney-Reunion-Mauritius. Cabin crew extremely rude simple requests such as glasses of water plainly ignored. Food was sub standard and if you felt peckish after the meal you were abruptly told to go help yourself at the rear of the plane to a platter of soggy cheese and butter sandwiches. Same for drinks pour- your-own-glass at the back of the pane in full view of the cabin crew who just pretended you didn't exist. Overall cabin crew appeared quite blasé and pompous.

### Air Austral customer review
Excellent trip between New Caledonia and St Denis of La Reunion. Onward and return on a Boeing 747 with good comfort on seats. Individual screens. Excellent service and good meals. The pitch was just too little for me and that's why I just give 9 and not 10.

### Air Austral customer review
Mauritius to Reunion return. Onward flight was on a Boeing 737-800 with only a 20% load so we had enough space during that 20 mins flight. Service was a cookie and juice which was nice. Return flight was on a ATR 72 aircraft with the same service. Crew was friendly and helpful. Flights and bags where on time. Would fly them again even ticket price is quite high.

### Air Austral customer review
Flew to Mauritius and my experience was unsatisfactory. The service was appalling. I pressed the hostess button numerous times with no response. One meal throughout the journey was inadequate with a very small snack before landing. My snack was a soggy sandwich and breakfast was no better. I will not recommend this airline. Quality is of the essence.

### Air Austral customer review
NOU-RUN-MRS return. The overall service and meals were beyond expectations for a French airline crews were polite professional and present throughout the cabin. All flights with brand new B773 are pleasant with PTV's and conformable seats. The only flight with B772 was on the MRS-RUN leg and it was a shame because no PTV on this ageing aircraft. However the transit area in Saint Denis La Réunion airport definitely needs to be revamped there is nothing Air Austral can do about it but I hope this will be modernised shortly.

### Air Austral customer review
MRU-RUN-SYD-NOU return. High level of service across the board. No difference between flying on an ATR 72-500 and a B777-300. The crew were well groomed polite and efficient. Great Creole cuisine with a French savoir fare. Hot meals for the main services and good open sandwiches in between. On Demand Entertainment System worked well with plenty of choices. International magazines available. Clean lavatories.

### Air Austral customer review
SYD-CDG return. I have travelled to Europe several times and never look forward to it. Booking and check-in no problem staff and service was very good. The addition of a TGV ticket to get me closer to my destination was much appreciated and connection was easy. My only quibble was a limited entertainment selection.

### Air Austral customer review
SYD to Mauritius. Excellent service and quite comfortable for Economy class. Flight attendants friendly always coming through the cabin with water. Plenty of food provided.

### Air Austral customer review
Sydney to Noumea Business Class. Fast check in at Sydney Airport they use the Qantas Club which was nice. Boarding delayed for 45minutes due to late arriving aircraft. Business Class roomy and seats comfortable not lie flat but very angled. Crew spoke mainly French and some broken English - but they are a French Airline. Food good service attentive and friendly didn't use the inflight entertainment. Overall not a bad product.

### Air Austral customer review
SYD-RUN-SEZ. Very attentive crew . Good and adequate food crew offering water . Leather seats comfortable and clean 777-300. More IFE options of movies and other programmes would make it better.

### Air Austral customer review
Sydney-Reunion-Mauritius. Not impressed staff sometimes quite rude. One meal with drinks provided after take off soggy sandwich about half way and small snack before landing. Drinks few and far between we could go and help ourselves to warm drinks with no ice. Overall would not fly Air Austral again and would not recommend it. Return flight not better!

### Air Austral customer review
Paris to St-Denis (Reunion) in Business Class. Seat is comfortable food is perfect and staff very friendly. In St-Denis lounge we got champagne and apetizers vry nice. Compared to Air France this company is excellent!

### Air Austral customer review
MEL to MRU via Sydney and Reunion with Air Austral. Overall nice experience although the flight is long. On the long haul flight meals are quite good and there are quite a lot of things on the platter. Before landing a snack is served. Sandwiches and beverages are provided during the whole flight. On short haul drinks only are served. Flight attendants are quite efficient but can barely speak English fluently. No individual screens.

### Air Austral customer review
CDG-RUN-ZSE. Outstanding service for the economy class good food very nice ground staff and crew. Fleet is modern with B777 with high quality entertainment system. Seat pitch tight and slightly cramped. RUN airport is small and allows very short connecting time if need to continue journey to east or Saint Pierre airport.

### Air Austral customer review
Flew Air Austral Syd-Run-Mauritius-Run-Syd – it is 100% better then Air Mauritius. The food was great and flight attendants were excellent and friendly. I’ve got a 19 month old so they kept the middle seat for us - free and they kept offering to help and asked if everything was ok. The only drawback is theres no PTV and not much info from cockpit.

### Air Austral customer review
Flew Air Austral return Sydney to Mauritius. Male flight attendants on the flight to RUN - nice however food provided is limited and alcohol only during meal times. Water is in short supply and passengers at the back of the plane were forgotten about almost all the time and rationing of water became an issue towards the end of the journey. Passengers were made to stay overnight in RUN - hotel stay provided to some passengers were terrible no assistance from the airline or hotel and dinner not provided (incur at passenger's expense). Return flight home was canceled with no word to most passengers (only upon check-in). Flight was canceled due to poor maintenance of the plane which suffered system difficulties on it's previous long haul journey and was forced to attempt emergency landing 3 times - and we were going to take this plane home! Was put up again at the same terrible hotel for the night. Female flight attendants extremely rude impatient and unwilling to communicate to passengers who cannot speak fluently in French. Very disappointed in the service provided by Air Austral will not fly again.

### Air Austral customer review
Noumea to Sydney found Air Austral staff friendly and good customer service. My only issue was the size of the seats in economy - a tight fit.

### Air Austral customer review
Only flew Air Austral for medium haul (RUN-SEY) but was excellent! Good service much space good food and very friendly staff! Next time we might choose them also for long haul.

### Air Austral customer review
CDG-RUN-CDG: Checkin at CDG was fast and even faster at RUN. Very friendly staff at both airports and during flight. 777 are in good shape and the cabin clean and comfortable. Food was excellent - also a lot of choice for drinks including wine during dinner. Cabin crew present and often come along with water during the night. An amenity kit is distributed after takeoff with socks earphones earplugs and eyemask. Only drawback is that there are no PTV's and there's not much info from the cockpit. All in all a very good experience.

### Air Austral customer review
CDG-RUN-CDG in Club Austral (Business) class. October - November 2006. Quick check-in nice lounges (although poor drink and snack selections) at both CDG and RUN. All flights perfectly on time quick delivery of luggage on arrival. Business class seat comfort (old) business class IFE (not on demand) first class service and meals. Overall a very nice product much cheaper than Air France and much better (at least compared to AF current B747 on this route ; new AF product using B777 is expected in 2007). Minor drawbacks : frequent flyer program does not seem on par with AF one ; CDG airport is further from Paris than ORY (which AF uses).

### Air Austral customer review
JNB-RUN-JNB. I have travelled with Air Austral 4 times between Johannesburg and Reunion. My first trip was in 1992 - my latest was in November 2005. Before my latest trip I was of the opinion that they were one of the best airline I had flown economy class. Their B737's were configured 100% economy. Now they have a 'Business Class' and economy seems to have deteriorated to 'Cattle Class' - and they are 'just another airline'. All of their service levels have dropped to mediocre. I still plan to use them again this year as I love the island and Air Austral are the only airline that flies from Johannesburg to Reunion.

### Air Austral customer review
I haven't had such a good quality of service or food on a tourist-class ticket in over 15 years (or more!). Our choice of Air Austral the first time was based mainly on the basis of our connection possibilities from Denmark. Next time it will be as a choice made by satisfied and loyal customers that believe that good treatment should be rewarded.

### Air Austral customer review
I recently flew to Reunion on Air Austral and was very impressed. I found the service was excellent and far superior to that of Air France.

### Air Austral customer review
I currently live in London and I fly once a year to Reunion for holidays. I use to fly on Air France in classe Alize (Economy Plus) but recently I tried Air Austral for the first time in Classe Loisirs (Economy) and was far more satisfied with the level of customer care in terms of punctuality high food quality and friendly staff. As being part of the Air France Frequence Plus scheme the good news is I can get some qualifying miles and this code-share flight makes my life easy as I don't need to change airport - ie remaining in CDG and not going to Orly. So I would recommend Air Austral in terms of: Comfort: their B777 is modern the seats are more comfortable and you have more space to put your hand luggage in the compartments above your head. Food: even in Classe Loisirs you have a huge plateau and you are really spoilt. Customer care: excellent staff. They provide you with warm towels as you get on board and in the morning. They also pass through at night asking you if you want some water while everyone is asleep. Everything with a smile! Punctuality: both outbound and return flights left on time. Unfortunately I read that Air France will stop this code-share flight with Air Austral and I find this decision very sad. I wish everyone who is part of Frequence Plus loyalty scheme to convince Air France to come back to its decision as the CDG-RUN-CDG must not disappear. Air Austral is the getaway to Reunion via CDG for all European and worldwide customers and you won't be disappointed. Thanks to Air Austral we are getting better airline service to Reunion excellent staff quality and well-deserved comfort. I'm very happy about their level of professionalism and the image the airline portrays of Reunion Island.

### Air Austral customer review
I flew this with this airline around the Indian Ocean with this airline for business purposes. There punctuality is great they are more often before time rather than on time. Recently i got the opportunity to try there new RUN-CDG-RUN flight in club class. Here also am very satisfied. There REPS in Mauritius are very competent. I recommend you this airline.

### Air Austral customer review
I'm used to fly with the french national airline because I'm a top-tier Frequence Plus cardholder but I have decided to try Air Austral on a trip from Reunion Island to Paris return in Business Class (they call it Club Austral). I have not been disappointed. The onboard crew was extremely helpful and smiley from boarding to disembarking. The seat which can recline 140 degrees -almost flat bed - is very comfortable good width and pitch. The food is tasty and includes a creole dish accompanied with spicy condiments and an interesting variety of wines. Even the bread is warm unlike other airlines I'm used to travel with. I have been especially impressed by the quality of the service on board and this from the FA to the captain. Good work.
