### "This is completely unacceptable"
I had purchased four tickets on flight #3052 from Chicago to Marion traveling December 30, 2023. The flight was to leave Chicago at 10:05 am. Early morning notification on the website indicated the plane would leave early, at about 9:30 am. My children and grandchildren, for whom I had purchased the tickets, arrived at the gate at approximately 8:00 am. 10:05 came and went without any notification or information about the flight from your staff at the gate. I tried calling the toll free number at about 10:35 and requested a call back from the automated system. At 11:26 I received automated text/email indicating the flight was delayed until 3:00. At the same time, staff working the gate notified the waiting passengers. Similarly, at about the same time your website was updated to say status was unavailable and to call the toll free number. Nothing was updated, in person, by phone, text or email, for the next several hours. At 2:16 we again received text, email, and in person notifications that the flight was again delayed until 4:30. The website never changed the flightâ€™s status. As I had still not received a call back from the morning call to the toll free number, I tried again, again requesting a call back. Finally, at about 3:10 pm I received a call back from your customer service member. At that point the representative had the same information, that the flight was delayed and should be leaving at 4:30. At about 3:30 passengers were told the plane they were waiting for had arrived and they would be boarding soon. Shortly after 4:00, the passengers were loaded onto a van and driven to a plane. Before boarding the plane, at about 4:30, the passengers were told this was not the plane to Marion and they were driven back to the terminal. Once at the gate they were notified that the correct plane to Marion had never arrived. Passengers were sorted by who could fit on to the next flight scheduled to leave for Marion at 5:50 pm. There was not enough room for all. There was some brief conversation about the idea that the 10:05 flight would leave after 6:00 pm, but the staff ultimately admitted that was unlikely. Finally at 8:02 pm, I received the text/email notification that the flight was cancelled. This is completely unacceptable. It is clear that Contour knew the flight was going to be cancelled from the beginning. Instead the staff provided little to no information over the course of 12 hours. My family, including two minors, spent all day waiting with the hope this plane would actually get them to their destination. They spent hundreds of dollars getting to/from the airport and in meals while waiting.

### "Worst airline ever!"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever! They do not provide gate # or terminal information in the confirmation email or their app. Chicago airport didn't even know the airline existed. Nightmare to fly this airline.

### "Contour declined any refund"
Not Verified |  Worse Experience during a time of sorrow. Booked with American with a connecting flight via Contour. Contour cancelled the flight on 27 Oct into PAH. Was offered a new flight into Evansville, IN or Nashville TN at 6:30PM, this flight was 6 Hours after my original flight was to depart. Why does that time matter, the time of sorrow was my fathers wake was 5-8PM, i was due to arrive in PAH at12:45PM. The flights into Evansville and Nashville did not arrive until the same time as the next PAH flight at 7:45PM, the next PAH was was supposedly sold out. Flying into the 2 offered locations would require 2+ hrs driving and $500 in rental car expense, on a flight I could have booked through Southwest, Nonstop and $400 cheaper. Here is the issue, American Desk Agents, Phone agents, and Contour Phone Agents simply refused to contact each other. American rebooked me on the Nashville flight, without my knowledge, and Contour stating they can not make changes to American Itineraries, creating 6+ hrs of phone time between both Airlines, hobbling across 2 terminals on crutches to get to my family, In the end, I was forced to buy a 2nd seat on Contour, on a flight that was "Sold Out" to be told, I had 2 seats 20 minutes before boarding, which contour refused to refund, because I was cancelling within 24 hrs of the flight, but only 15 minutes after being told I didnt have seat. American and Contour refused to contact each other and American refused to talk to a Contour REP I had on the phone. Total 8 hrs on a 45 minute layover, $800+ dollars and a flight credit on an airline that flys no where. And what else - American refuses to entertain my refund request, Contour declined any refund stating I flew on that day. even though i was forced to buy a 2nd ticket, that I did not need, and would only issue a credit, 15 minutes after I bought it. The Agents I interacted with on 3 NOV were the rudest, most unprofessional customers service reps I have ever experienced.
