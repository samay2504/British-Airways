### "Stay away from this airline"
I had booked several months ago and my e-ticket included 10kg luggage. When I arrived at the gate in Malta, the staff told me that their rules had changed and the flights no longer include free baggage. I showed them my booking but they would not accept it. Many other customers had the same issue and we all complained. Finally the staff had to call security guards over to restore order as people all complained. Terrible experience that cost me 40 Euro on top of what I had booked. Stay away from this airline.

### "Worst airline experience ever"
Worst airline experience ever. I booked a round trip flight with Air Malta in September. It was the worst experience I've ever had with any airline. My flight into Rome was delayed. I arrived at the gate to depart for Malta and the plane was still there. The doors were closed, however, and the representatives at the gate and they would not let me board. Fair enough as the doors were closed. Unacceptably, however, they offered zero assistance and ignored me. They did not "all but" ignore me. They ignored me. The woman literally grabbed her purse and walked away without offering any help. I went to the counter back at check in and the woman there said she could only help with luggage issues, not tickets. She said I'd have to wait for the next attendant to arrive at 9 pm that night (it was mid-morning). I booked a flight on ITA and got to Malta. I tried multiple times to contact the airline but no one ever answered their phone. I sat on hold forever. The concierge at my hotel also tried to call but likewise had no success, just sat on hold. The website, as others have noted, is useless and would not allow me to even access my reservation (it also would not allow me access before I departed the US after learning that my flight was going to be delayed, fwiw). When I arrived at the airport a few days later to return home, I was told my ticket had been cancelled. Not just the flight to Malta, but the entire round trip. They never sent me any notice: no email, no text, nothing, just "surprise" when I got to the airport. I was then billed almost 4 times what I originally paid for the exact same seat on the exact same flight! No apologies and no refund offered for the first part. Since that time, I have attempted numerous times to get a refund for part of what I paid. Nothing but a form response saying no without explanation. The website says flights cancelled more than 24 hours before will be refunded (mine was cancelled by them well outside that window) but they do not even acknowledge that this is their policy. But for the fact that I actually saw the airplanes and they did get me from Malta back to Rome, I'd say it is a giant scam. Worst customer service ever seems inappropriate because, per above, I do not think they actually offer any customer service, just a dead-end telephone number, a dead-end email address that send form responses, and a dead-end website that you can't actually access after making payment.

### "Avoid this airline at all cost"
In October 2023, I was supposed to fly from Malta to Tel Aviv, but the airline cancelled the flight due to the Israel-Hamas war. Consequently, I had to extend my stay in the hotel by two nights, book a different and more expensive flight with Air Malta to Larnaca, Cyprus, and take another flight back to Israel from there with a different airline. The two additional nights in the hotel, the fare difference between the original and new flight and the additional flight back to Israel cost me nearly EUR 1,000. Not only that, when I booked the new flight to Larnaca, I requested 2 additional check-in bags similar to the original flight that was cancelled. I was told each bag would be EUR 40 each. Only after booking the new flight, I was told that in fact the ticket they sold me was operated by a different airline (Emirates), and that I can only pay for the additional baggage at the airport before the flight. Imagine my shock when checking in at the airport, Emirates charged me EUR 237 per additional bag!! I was told the EUR 40 per bag was not correct. I was left with no alternative but to pay the outrageous extra cost or leave my luggage behind. I contacted Air Malta several times via email, they never responded. Avoid this airline at all cost!

### "months of chasing we still don’t have the refund"
Not Verified |  01-Sep-2023 flight from UK to Malta delayed 2 hours. Impact got to accommodation 2am. 02-Sep-2023 flight from UK to Malta delayed 3 hours. Impact missed seeing family in Malta before connecting flight departed. 02-Sep-2023 flight from Malta to Palermo delayed 4 hours. Impact car rental closed. Arrived at accommodation 3am. Having to pay 40 EUR for taxis. Claiming under EU 261. 10-Sep-2023 flight from Malta to UK. They have removed my wife from the booking because she flew a day early on 01-Sep-2023 and claimed she was a no show on the original flight on 02–Sep-2023. We requested her to be re-added to the flight. We were promised a call back within 1 hour. We never got a call back and have been unable to get through on the phone all day. Impact we had to book a new flight with EasyJet costing 550 EUR. The flight is departing at 2:30am so we won’t get any sleep. We cancelled 2x flights in June for future trips and we are eligible for 50% refund. After months of chasing we still don’t have the refund. We are questioning Air Malta’s solvency at the moment and we won’t be booking any future flights for fear of Air Malta going bankrupt along with the incredibly poor, stressful and expensive experience.

### "crew were friendly and welcoming"
Not Verified |  All flights were on time and comfortable. Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming. On board snacks to buy were good value. Seat pitch good average. Last year we few with this company from Madrid to Malta and return. Both flights very good.

### "the experience was not good"
Overall, the experience was not good. The outbound flight from LHR to MLA was delayed 2 hours and the return segment was delayed 1 hour on the screen but in reality we arrived back 1.5 hours late. Very limited information re delay and no real apology for it. On both legs I paid for and selected seats at the time of booking and on checking in found that we had been moved 10 rows back on both legs, there was no prior notification of this and no apology. I don't know why I paid to select specific seats at the time of booking if I was not provided these. Overall not a great experience. Other family members also travelled to Malta at the same time to join our holiday and flew on EasyJet and Ryanair, their flights were on time and they received the seats they paid for. My reason for selecting Air Malta was the convivence of flying from LHR which is much closer to me, in reality with the delay I could have travelled on public transport from Gatwick and been home at the same time by travelling on a so called "low cost carrier" with what it would seem is a much better overall experience. Onboard the service was fine and the cabin was fine my disappointment was only in relation to above. The fare I would describe as reasonable because I booked 7 months in advance so on par with other carriers.

### "my bag was confiscated"
At the check-in in Vienna the clerk called Air Malta to check if I could travel with my sailing life jacket which contains a 22g CO2 cartridge. He confirmed that Air Malta granted permission for this. I then asked the check-in clerk to confirm with the captain that this was ok. He came back to me say that the captain had given his permission. I flew to Malta and my bag was not on the conveyor on arrival. I found out two days later by sending my wife to Vienna Airport that security in Vienna found the CO2 cartridge and asked Air Malta if they can release it. Air Malta declined and my bag was confiscated. My wife managed to access the bag, and after removing my life jacket the bag was flown to Malta. Not only did Air Malta not honour their agreement to carry my bag, but they did not inform me of what had happened. To make things worse, after trying more than 30 times - all day in fact - to call Air Malta I did not succeed in getting any information. I was never informed as to what had happened. Without sending someone to Vienna airport at great inconvenience I would never have known what happened to my Bag.

### "we are entitled to compensation"
Not Verified |  The flight we took was initially delayed twice, and then cancelled afterwards, making us lose the second flight from Amsterdam to New York. Therefore, as per EU regulation, we are entitled to compensation (600 euros each for two people), which they acknowledge. After having sent the bank wire details on the 17th of April, regardless the several call occurred, they still did not complete the payment without providing any kind of reason for the delay. At this point, after all this time, seems clear that their decision is not to pay at all and to wait until they will become a new entity (as has been announced over the media).

### "extra legroom reservation was not respected"
Aircraft changes are normal these days. Flight experience ok, nothing to say against it. Industry standard seat pitch, inflight food and drinks. Very good fare. But my emergency extra legroom reservation was not respected, only the seat number. I was asked if I have reserved 13D, but they did not mention that this is no emergency row anymore. So losing three of my points. Beside the badly trained check-in staff, I do not understand why an airline with one airplane type is giving to some few planes other row numbers for emergency rows, when selling them for higher fees.

### "save your time and money"
Not Verified | Worst flying experience ever. We have to wait 17 hours to get back home. We sleep on floors but then security comes and tells us we’re not even allowed to sit on the floor. They want us to stand for 17 hours? On the flight from Vienna to Malta we weren’t even offered drinks and I don’t mean free drinks but not even an option that we could buy them. If you want to travel with Air Malta don’t do it. Save your time, money and everything. If you still want to go beware that you going to end up in trouble.

### "Same baggage chaos coming back"
Not Verified |  Chaotic boarding because of all hand luggage that clearly exceeded allowances. Overpriced, poor quality onboard food and drink (€3.50 for cheap instant coffee). Nearly an hour before they deplaned and another hour for baggage. No real baggage drop, inadequate check-in desks at MLA and very slow. Seat change just to satisfy late check in's and put me in an exit row despite telling them I had medical conditions that should exclude me. They used the old 'late aircraft change ' excuse. Air Malta have a common seating plan throughout the fleet, making seat changes unnecessary in the event of an aircraft change. Same baggage chaos coming back. All that lost revenue from hold baggage charges that could be levied! Ground staff and cabin crew need customer service training.

### "prices are absolutely ridiculous"
It is an absolute joke that Air Malta does not have an app in 2023. Plus the prices are absolutely ridiculous. I don't know what revenue strategy they try but should definitely reconsider it. It make zero sense. A ticket in economy costs 430 euros and a ticket in business class 290 euros on their website, at the same time, and for the same destination. I understand this is not a low cost carrier however it really acts like one. Too bad you don't have other options if you want to reach the destination.

### "like the worst low cost carrier"
The customer service was non-existent and shambolic. On the return flight KM102 from Malta to London Heathrow (3rd January), there was over a 3 hour delay for the passengers in obtaining luggage, this is longer than the actual flight. There was no onsite Air Malta customer service to assist and advise what was going on or when to expect our luggage. Due to the evening flight and long ongoing drive home my family had to leave without our luggage. This meant I had the unfortunate situation of dealing with the central customer services based in Malta to try and recover my luggage. To date Air Malta’s central customer services have still not responded to my emails. Their advice provided by phone was nonsensical. Due to no local phone number, I had to pay international rates to contact them for their absolutely useless support. Subsequently, I drove 3.5 hours back to Heathrow at a later date in my own time and at my own expense to see if I could obtain my luggage. Fortunately this was successful, however I found that my luggage had been sitting unsecured in terminal 4’s luggage reclaim for 4 days. There was nothing to stop people taking the whole suitcase or personal possessions. To sum up I will never use this airline again, this airline is an insult to the nation of Malta. Air Malta are acting like the worst low cost carrier, whilst charging their tickets at a premium.

### "using Air Malta is asking for trouble"
On our flight from Paris, they successfully lost our main suitcase. When we tried to talk to their office beside check-in desk 1a, their representative was incredibly rude and abusive, including turning her back and walking away. Not what we were expecting. On the last day of our stay in Malta, they told us that they had located and received our luggage and would send it on to us. Five hours later, however, they admitted that they had lost it again. When they rediscovered it, we instructed them to keep it within sight whilst we travelled to the airport to collect it (an hour each way) as they were unconvincing about whether they would deliver it to the right hotel and were even uncertain about whether it would be before or after we left. In the end, we had the use of said suitcase for four hours either side of midnight, out of a four day stay. The airline also successfully destroyed our other suitcase by virtually breaking off one of the wheels. We received no apologies, no sympathy and not even regret from their people. Obviously, Malta itself is an attractive destination. But if you want to enjoy it, I strongly recommend that you fly via another airline, and watch out for any codeshares; using Air Malta is asking for trouble.

### "shameless overbooking"
My flight was deliberately overbooked and despite having booked my tickets 10 months prior and arriving at the airport 4 hours early I was turned away despite having a ticket. We were persistently told different things by different members of staff. I rang Air Malta customer service who said they would call me back and then literally hung up on me. The Air Malta representative at the airport then refused to speak to us. When I rang the day before I was guaranteed the flight was not overbooked and there was no problem. I have never been subjected to such dreadfully poor customer service. Offers of remedial compensation will not make up for the inconvenience and distress caused by your airline’s shameless overbooking.

### "avoiding my refund for over a year"
Shameful airline, avoiding my refund now for over a year. Emailed over 20 times, called over 10 times. Somehow could pay back the cheaper ticket but lost the same bank details for the more expensive ticket. Fly with anyone else.

### "taxes are not refundable"
Booked our ticket in September 2021. Unfortunately, another leg of the trip was cancelled by Lufthansa (who refunded us in less than 24 hours), which means that I had to cancel my AM flight. No worries though, I made sure that the booking was 'fully refundable' before committing. Applied for a refund on the 3rd of November, 2021 and was told that I should have my money back within 60 working days. Fast forward to the 18th of June, 2022 - I have been refunded half of the original amount paid, with AM quipping that taxes are not refundable, none of this was mentioned when booking and cancelling the flight.

### "demand one straight answer"
Not Verified |  After our flight on the 7th of June 2020 was cancelled due to covid restrictions we had to reschedule our flight to the 8th of August 2021. Unfortunately, at the last minute, Malta changed its Covid regulations, not recognising a covid recovery certificate as viable. Due to this, we had to request a refund, which I completed at the start of August 2020. On the 31st of January 2022 my refund was processed. The company requested I provide them with my banking information so that they could transfer the funds. I already provided them with my banking information the moment I bought a ticket through the airline. Since the 31 st of January I have contacted air Malta call centre more than 15 times. Every employee I have on the telephone seems to have a different excuse for why it had not been transferred to my account yet. In addition, the employees always promise me they will call me back or send me an email. However, they never do. They also claim that they cannot contact any other department within their company via telephone "due to company policy", which makes its easy for them to delay the truth of my refund status every time I call them. I am getting sick and tired of the constant lies and demand one straight answer.

### "we still haven't got our money back"
Not Verified |  In December 2019 we booked our trip to Malta with Air Malta for our family of 6 persons. Without covid-19, we would travel to Malta in May 2020. Unfortunately, Air Malta cancelled our trip, because of the covid-restrictions. They gave us three options. We chose for the option to wait one year and ask for a refund. We did ask for the refund after one year. After several calls and e-mails to Air Malta we still haven't got our money back. I see that more people have this problem with Air Malta. We have the right to get our money back.

### "did not receive our money back yet"
In December 2019/January 2020 we booked our trip to Malta with Air Malta. Without covid-19, we would travel to Malta in June 2020. Unfortunately, Air Malta cancelled our trip, because of the covid-restrictions, which I fully understand. They gave us three options. We chose for the option, to wait one year and ask for a refund. I also understood that they could not immediately pay everyone back, but wanted to spread things, and that we needed to wait one year. But now, we are almost two years further and we did not receive our money back yet. And I think this will never happen anymore because now, they even don’t answer my e-mails anymore. So thank you, for stealing money from a young couple, building on their future. Therefore, I would not recommend Air Malta to my family and friends.

### "was better than many other European airline flights I have been on"
Let me first get over my never-ending grumble about how awful European Airlines' Business Class seating is - an economy seat with the middle seat blocked, and no extra legroom. However, my frustration was eased considerably on my flights with Air Malta. Yes, it was the same layout - 3x3 with the middle seat empty, but with about 2 inches more legroom, and slight recline, which actually did make a difference. And the seating was surprisingly comfortable. The flights both outbound and return were on time, and the cabin crew though disengaging (understandably due to covid) were however polite and professional on the service front. On both flights, a pre-meal drink of fruit juice and prosecco (no champagne) was offered. On the outbound flight a delicious lunch was served, all on one tray, consisting of several small items and a hot main course of Maltese Beef Bragioli (stuffed meat bundles). The presentation was excellent in traditional Maltese ceramicware, known as 'Zingla' bowls. Lunch followed by coffee and drinks from the bar. On the return flight, the typical breakfast of egg, bacon, mushroom, and tomato (a bit boring) was served. Both the mini bread rolls and croissants were warm. Overall, I did enjoy both flights, and was better than many other European airline flights I have been on.

### "this was a good experience"
Overall this was a good experience and all was on time. There was an issue around online check-in as it seems you still need to visit the desk. We did online check-in and were issued with boarding passes and seat allocations. This worked through airport security but was an issue when we tried boarding at the gate and they had to re-check us in. Service from there was good. Maybe not as personable as some airlines but crew often checked we were doing OK and offered top ups. D.O.C prosecco was on offer rather than champagne but there was a fair selection of drinks. The meal was quite impressive with the Maltese tile below the plate. Food was of good quality, the pate was amazing and the bread warm and fluffy. All else was well cooked and impressive for a short haul flight. This was my first time flying with Air Malta, the experience was good.

### "nobody seems to be able or willing to help"
Worst experience in my life. At the airport I asked what the status was for using my ‘COVID-voucher’. The ticketing desk is unwilling to help, refers to me to yet another e-mail address of the refunds department, who apparently, have no phone and cannot be reached by anybody from the Air Malta ticketing desk. I’ve been calling and mailing for weeks now to use that voucher and nobody seems to be able or willing to help. That combined with the answer: sir, if you do not leave this desk I will call airport security. I will not rest until I get what I’m entitled to.

### "priority boarding and seat were lost"
Not Verified |  Changed my return flight with Air Malta. This can only be done by phone. But the guy on the phone must have made a mistake, because my booking code was faulty. I could not log in and I was not on the passenger list. Also, my priority boarding and seat were lost. This could not be corrected by phone. Had to be done on the airport. So both on going out and the return flight I had a problem. Air Malta's check in desks and supervisor treated me like it was somehow my fault! No apologies or anything, just 45 minutes of hassle upon check in and no priority available even though I could prove I paid for it. They did put me in the passenger list again, reluctantly. So finally I did go to Malta and back again.

### "extra luggage is non-refundable"
If I could give them minus 5 stars I would. This is the worst and most dishonest airline I have ever dealt with. Don't expect them to ever return your phone call or email because it won't happen. I paid for extra luggage but was not allowed to use it because they didn't update the ticket. Then they admitted the mistake but won't refund the cost because extra luggage is non-refundable. This makes no sense.

### "Was promised a refund"
Was promised a refund for my cancelled flight over 5 months ago. It still hasn't been processed. Air Malta are ignoring all attempts to contact them to chase up on this, and have not issued a single update on when refunds will actually be processed. Avoid at all costs.

### "Very tiring flight"
The interior is old but confortable. It wasn't clean in Lisbon. Very tiring flight. No free service onboard. Bought a vegetarian lasagne, it was a regretful idea.

### "worst customer support"
Worst airline and worst customer support. The customer service is rude and they never work towards a solution. They always find excuses for the airline and imply that the airline is never responsible for anything.

### "below average experience"
I was slightly disappointed with my Air Malta experience. Wwe flew from Palermo to Malta, then to Rome after our holiday. In Palermo, there was only one check in counter open, which was necessary for us since we had to check our luggage. Thankfully we arrived early and there was only a very small queue. Palermo airport has terrible signage, we didn’t know where the check in counter was until we walked to the wrong zone. Boarding was done by bus at Palermo, all flights had bus gates. In Malta this is fine since there is literally no physical gates. Boarding was rather fast, and there were no zones, everybody can board at the same time. Both A320s we flew were older. The first flight was an all economy configuration, so the system gave us row 2, and row 3 was empty so I moved back to get a view of the landing. On the flight to Rome it was a bit weird, i was sent multiple emails asking if I would like to get upgraded, for what actually would’ve cost me double my ticket cost. Nobody was actually sitting in the first three rows, we had row 4 so I wanted to move to row 3 but the crew didn’t let me or anybody else. Service on both flights seemed nonexistent. I expected a drinks service on the Rome flight. The crew were friendly, seemed professional and helpful to those who needed help. Overall, a below average experience, if flying from Italy, I would recommend them. If flying from the UK or other parts of Europe, try to consider another carrier as well.

### "Staff were miserable"
Not Verified |  Heathrow to Malta. We were a party of 4 adults and one child. Staff were miserable. Hot food had to be ordered, but no one asked if we wanted anything. When we asked for a toastie it was like being told off for not ordering it. Drinks and food were served with a pay machine shoved in your face. The staff didnt even stop their conversation whilst serving us. When leaving the aeroplane, as always we said thankyou and again they couldnt acknowledge us or stop their conversation. One of our suitcases was ripped, got in a queue behind 5 others who had damaged cases. Our case was beyond repair and needed a new one to fly home with. 1 day of our 10 day holiday was spent getting a taxi to the nearest town, finding a shop that sold cases then taxi back to the hotel.

### "refused to pay any compensation whatsoever"
Not Verified |  Air Malta cancelled the second leg of my ticket. They did not inform me nor the travel agent in time. I was finally re-routed with a 4 hour delay and no compensation whatsoever. It was a horrible flight! This is not the first time Air Malta has ruined my holiday. Last year my luggage arrived 6 days late for a cruise and Air Malta refused to pay any compensation whatsoever. I can only warn anybody not to book this airline!

### "2 hours flight is the maximum one would want to experience"
Air Malta offers cheap tickets between VIE and Luqa. Both flights were on time. Although the seat configuration of the A320 is similar to their competitors they are still using very old seats that cause the feeling of having absolutely no room at all. I think that is the main problem with Air Malta - not sure if they are about to change that or invest into new planes but I would say a 2 hours flight is the maximum one would want to experience. There is no real service except the sales-trolleys so I was extremly surprised to see 5 cabin crew members on both flights instead of the regular minimum of 4 (certainly not because of the work load). Their business class is a little joke - there's not even a cabin divider so I was happy that I did not pay for a last-minute upgrade. When available in the cabin the crew was friendly but most of the time all five of them were not visible on both sectors. Since their competitors on this route are even worse I would say that KM is the best option our of VIE for flights to Luqa.

### "forced to check in hand luggage"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Malta. I was forced to check in my hand luggage. They said there was no room in the plane, so it had to go in the hold. It was opened and things stolen. The whole reason I only took hand luggage. No compensation, it wasn't their responsibility they said.

### "excuses and no compensation"
Amsterdam to Valletta. At check in we were told that the aircraft would be small and different to usual Air Malta airbus, and had to give in our hand luggage in which we had breakables and no locks. There was also no food or beverages you can buy on the plane and as 'compensation' they gave us a 4.95 euro voucher to buy something quickly before. The plane was not Air Malta but GetJet - a Lithuanian airline which operates very old aircraft. None of the crew or the captain were Maltese. I am a nervous flyer- we paid extra money to use Air Malta because we trust Air Malta. Had we gone for a cheaper budget airline we would have saved a lot of money and we still would have had a better experience as at least they offer refreshments on the plane. We also had an hour delay before take-off and when we asked the crew what the problem was they replied that they did not know. Two of our luggages were badly damaged and a rain jacket was missing from a side pocket of my luggage which was found opened. What's even worse than this experience is their customer service - a whole month of sending emails and reminders and calling, only to get nowhere except excuses and no compensation at all.

### "Complete rip-off"
Malta to Lyon. First time ever flying Air Malta, visiting the beautiful island of Malta for the first time with my wife on our honeymoon. Arrived on easyJet and Purchased one-way tickets to leave thru Air Malta. Paid 2 x 90€ for the flights. Paid 2 x 80€ for 2 pieces of 20kg luggage. 180€ in air fare. 160€ in luggage. Complete rip-off.

### "won't fly Air Malta again!"
Kiev to Malta. I bought my flight through an aggregator site, so I wasn't able to pay for bags, so I tried to go on Air Maltas site to pay for bags. When I put in my confirmation code, the system wasn't able to find my info. When I tried to call customer service I wasn't able to speak to anyone and it went to voicemail. I left a Voicemail and never got a call back, so I went on their site and bought a voucher for my flight for €50 each way. When I got to the airport they told me there was no record of me paying for my bag, and even when I showed my voucher they said since it's not in the system they can't honor it. They called Air Malta and Air Malta said the same thing, so I had to pay another €80 for my bag or I wasn't getting on the flight. When I emailed Air Malta they told me I bought the wrong voucher and wouldn't issue a refund. I have no problem paying for bags but at least make it easier to do so and the customer service should work with customers to make sure they have a good experience. I had an awful one this time and won't fly Air Malta again!

### "airplane was in acceptable condition"
Malta to Paris CDG. The check-in staff was not welcoming or kind, but did their job. Security screening and boarding process expedite and simple. The airplane was in acceptable condition, short leg room but comfortable seats. The cabin crew, like the check in staff, was professional, but not specially kind. Flight departed exactly on time, and arrived 20 min before schedule. Comfortably managed by flight deck.

### "nobody explained what’s happening"
Malta to Palermo. Our flight was suppose to leave at 5am on 9th September. We were a whole family, with 3 kids aged between 2-9 years old. At 3:30am we were at the airport, everything looked fine, the gate opened as well. At 4:30am, the flight was delayed to 6:10am. A few minutes after our flight was marked as “More info at 8” at 8 it got marked “more info at 9”, and so on until it stopped “More info at 11”. In the meantime nobody explained what’s happening. Excuses ranged from no staff available, to no plane available, to no coach to take us to the plane. After hours fighting and arguing, the flight got delayed to 10PM. They offered accomodation for all of us, only to spend 2 more hours just to take us there. The issues escalated as we ended up with police and RIU officers around us. Finally at 2pm we arrived at our hotel, slept and showered and at 7pm were picked up again. While waiting in our gate for our flight at 10PM, it was once more delayed to 10:40pm.

### "Overall a great flight"
Not Verified |  The inbound flight arrived with roughly an hour delay and boarding was quite awful as we were told to wait in the jetbridge for around 5-10 minutes, then we left with an hour and a half of delay, and the crew wasn't very smiling and welcoming - but you get used to it with Air Malta.I ordered a warm sandwich and it was delicious, they have some movies in the overhead screens, but that's it, and the legroom is above average. Overall a great flight. However, after arrival in Malta airport, our luggage was extremely damaged,  and the ticket prices are quite high compared to what you get.

### "crew very cold, no smile"
We were supposed to be returning back from Malta to Southend, where we took off few days previously. Unfortunately, few weeks before our trip our flight back was cancelled and we had no other alternative but to accept a flight back from Malta to Gatwick. Before we left the UK I wrote an email to customer service and they assured me I could get a cab back reimbursed between Gatwick airport and Southend airport by producing a receipt. Which I did. But unfortunately I had further forms to fill and all my firends had to give permission and sign for me to send their passport details to Air Malta and another too. Why are they making things so complicated ! I am the one who paid for the cab why should my friends have to fill those forms and send them back to Air Malta, is beyond me. I don't think I will ever get reimbursed for that cab back, on top of the inconvenience it has caused me and the time I have sent trying to sort it out! Other small details, the checking online kept crashing : it took me 50 minutes to manage it for myself and my friends. Also onboard we had a mid morning flight arriving after 2pm : we were sitting in the middle of the plane - they ran out of sandwiches. Had to make do with some crisps. On the way out, I wasn't very impressed with the cabin crew, very cold, no smile. Never using that airline again.

### "small and incompetent crew"
I was routed onto the Air Malta website by Skyscanner to book simple 40 minute puddle jump from Catania to Malta, and tried booking my flight through there. Never got a confirmation e-mail or anything, which would be strange for most airlines but, as I'm reading the reviews here, is typical for Air Malta. So I called up "Customer Services" long distance and after 40 minutes got a hold of a pretty friendly fellow who looked up my reservation promptly rebooked my flight onto the wrong day. Finally got a confirmation of my flight on e-mail, spotted the mistake, called them back. Got a new guy who went through the whole procedure all over again. Got confirmation e-mail. Wrong flight. Then called again and got some crazy fellow who started screaming at me on the phone and put me on hold for half an hour, and wanted to charge me twice the amount for the flight I had already booked. I demonstrated to this out of control hothead how easy it was to book on another website by actually booking and canceling my flight on Expedia while he waited - that's how desperate he was to prove the point that their website worked fine which he lost. Too complicated. Just took the hydrofoil over as I'd lost faith in this small and incompetent crew. Too bad as the hydrofoil proved to be much more interesting and faster than the entire time I spent on the phone with these guys. I understand from captive clients in Malta that no-one books on their website but goes through third parties or even travel agents to avoid.

### "avoid them as much as you can"
Rome to Malta. They have a dysfunctional technical system and website that might do booking errors and even send you confirmation emails with wrong data. The better part comes when you try to deal with their customer service for emergencies; this is when you realize that their call center is only person and that they are not “customer service” but rather “Customer Support” for ticketing as they mentioned. Finally for the cherry on top; even if they do realize they made a mistake they never own up to it but rather tell the customer that it is their fault for trusting the confirmation email they received. So they ask the customer to solve his issues and try to fly somehow either on other airlines or by paying for new tickets with new prices till they asses the case and decide whether a refund for the old booking is required. That is all besides the fact that their airport staff are of course hugely incompetent. I have travelled with more than 23 different airlines but this was by far the worst experience i had with an airline that supposedly charges you regular prices but operates as a low-fare or worse. Try to avoid them as much as you can!

### "there is a problem with check-in"
Malta to Heathrow. I used to go business class but unless you have the front row the leg room isn't very good. It is also quite antiquated compared to say Cathy Pacific where for the same flight-time of around three hours you get your own cubicle, a menu and top-class service. I now fly economy and every time there is a problem with check-in. Instead of having designated check-in desks for each destination they have about five for all destinations. This causes all sorts of problems as each flight destination has differing takeoff times. It's not rocket science to figure out if there's a huge holdup in your queue with everyone going to different places that the earlier flights have the danger of either missing their flight or spending so much time queuing you get no time to relax or have breakfast before boarding. When I travelled to Heathrow from Malta in April this year the computer in our queue packed up. Instead of using some sort of intelligence and splitting our queue into other ones which were working we were simply standing waiting. I had got to the airport early and spent almost an hour in the queue just standing. In the end I jumped queues as I was worried I might miss my flight. The check-in staff are very slow, the slowest out of all the many airlines I've travelled with. The only trouble is I have to use them as there is no alternative.

### "My experience was very bitter"
London Gatwick to Malta with Air Malta. The first face of the airline is the check-in counter. My experience was very bitter. Not friendly and acted as if you were not welcome at all. Also the lounge is a joke. They use the No. 1 lounge, which is packed with priority pass members - so packed that there are no places to sit and the food selection in the morning was bad.

### "Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming"
Not Verified |  Flew LGW to Malta and return in April with Air Malta. Flights both ways were on time and comfortable. Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming. On board snacks to buy were good value. Seat pitch average but not cramped.

### "no help whatsoever"
Our terrible time with Air Malta started with baggage check-in. We bought our tickets through Expedia and they just said "Economy". Turns out Air Malta has like 5 different ticket types and the one we had didn't have checked baggage. We didn't know this in advance, but whatever, we payed to check-in our luggage. We were traveling as a group of 3 and my friend was in a wheelchair because her leg was broken. She has been in a full cast up to her knee for over a month. On our way to Malta from Israel on flight Air Malta 829 that departed Sunday morning Apr. 14, 2019 at 7 AM, my friend was questioned about her cast, how long she's had it and if she's cleared to fly. We answered all of their questions, told them the cast was a month old and that the doctors cleared her to fly. In the end of this questioning we were all allowed to board and the Israeli ground stewardess even found my friend a row of seats so that she could elevate her leg comfortably. On our way BACK from Malta to Israel on flight Air Malta 828 that departed Friday morning Apr. 18, 2019 at 1 AM, my friend was giving the same round of questions, except that this time they declared she was unfit to fly and that their doctor said it would be very dangerous for my friend to fly with a full cast. It did not help that we told them we flew with there airline 5 days ago and that she was fine (they said that this was a mistake and she should never have been let on the first flight to begin with) or that we had papers (in Hebrew) proving my friend's cast was at least several weeks old - nothing helped. They told us she had to go to a clinic in Malta to get her cast cut so that it was a half (and not full cast) and that we were wasting our time. My 2 traveling companions got in a cab and went to go get the cast cut, in a foreign country where we knew nothing of the healthcare system. This would have been fine, but the clinic they sent us do didn't have the equipment to cut the cast! So that trip was a waste. When we asked what we could do if their own recommendation didn't pan out and they said that my friend would have to stay to get her cast cut at the hospital. We tried to find out from the Maltese Air Malta manager if there would be any kind of compensation since they would not let my fried on the plane - could they transfer her ticket? Book her a hotel for her extra overnight stay? We were given a negative response on both counts and she told us that it was stated clearly in the Air Malta rules that you cannot fly with a full cast (we searched for a while for these alleged rules and couldn't find them, only general airline guidelines that said you shouldn't fly within a few days of getting a cast) so this was our problem. When we tried to find out what else we could do and if we could maybe get the hospital that treated my friend to send an email in English that cleared her to fly, the manager speaking to us was very rude, said she was repeating herself and just walked away. Since the 3rd traveling companion and I could not afford to wait any longer or buy new tickets, we left my friend in a cast, with her wheelchair and crutches, to stay alone overnight and try and book another flight. Air Malta was obviously no help whatsoever. In the end my friend got a doctor's letter in English saying she was cleared to fly, and booked herself a flight back to Israel through another airline company (with a layover in Vienna, so this was not the most convenient flight.

### "operated by Smartlynx"
Flight operated as wet lease by Smartlynx (Latvia) having two additional flight attendants from Air Malta on board to overlook the board sales. Ex Lufthansa airplane. Although boarding on time, they had several minor problems, then always new paperwork and of course each time the promise that we will be in the next 10 minutes airborne. Takeoff delay about 1 hour 45 minutes, arrival still 1 hour and 15 minutes. This may happen, but it was the first flight in all my life, that had not only smaller technical problems but as soon as we were airborne also all toilets out of order at once. Not pleasure at all! Would not recommend SmartLynx. Air Malta was so far ok, nothing special but ok. And cheap, so you get what you are paying for.

### "The service unfriendly"
Vienna to Malta. The problem started when I tried to book AirMalta on their Website. After 2 days without any success I booked the flights through tripair. No chance to see on air Malta booking page whether the booking existed. Web check in impossible. I finally phoned Malta Air in Malta and they sent boarding passes to my Email address in Vienna. For the return flights the same chaos. I tried the web check in for one hours; always breakdown! Finally the girl on the hotel counter tried it by phone which took another hour (waiting in the line). Then they promised to send the boarding passes to my phone. Did not work! Finally they sent them to the hotel's email and then to my phone! The seat reservation I had made in Vienna was gone. The service unfriendly and on the plane the charged for a cup of tea and a cup of coffee 6€. A real "Malta Experience". They either don't understand the business or just don't care.

### "never trust Air Malta again"
Southend to Catania. A few miles from destination the pilot announced that we could not land to Catania due to Etna eruption and instead we would land in Malta. There are at the least 5 airports nearby Catania (Palermo, Comiso, Trapani, Reggio Calabria, Lamezia Terme). Soon after the captain announced that we would land to Comiso (Sicily) but his lack of experience did not allow him to fight against the winds so he headed to Malta. As soon as we spoke with the Luqa airport Air Malta ground staff and the Info kiosk staff we realized that we would not have any chance to spend our Christmas with our families. Air Malta staff appeared unaware of our redirected flight and was unable to answer our requests for assistance. Malta is connected regularly via ferries and speedy boats to Sicily but the Air Malta staff told us that there would have been an announcement in 20 minutes time. Twenty minutes passed and so 40 and so 1 hour and the staff from the help desk was abandoning their seats till when there was no staff at the front office. Passengers were worried, and we started asking for bottles of water and lunch voucher but they kept saying there would be an announcement in a minutes. We could have been transferred to Sicily by ferry boat or speedy boats but instead Air Malta spending time agreeing a strategy: useless to contact them by phone as the operators were keeping saying that the number was only for reservations. After 5 hours standing up, without drinking nor eating the staff told us to move at the check in desk for the flight to Rome that would land in Catania first. We moved at the check-in desk but the staff at the desk was unaware that would land to Catania and denied us to check in. After other 45 minutes standing up in front of the desk the first passenger received the boarding pass. The flight was planned for 19:00 but I received my boarding pass at around 19:45. The flight was already in extreme delay and the crew was going back and forth counting the passengers on the flight delaying even more the departure. We would have already been in Catania if the flight would have departed on time but Catania Airport shut down again at 9.30 pm. The captain went out from the cabin and called the police to force us to leave the airplane. The situation was unreal: children crying, an adult having a crisis that required the assistance of a doctor, the police shouting against frustrated passengers stressing them even more until when they started forcedly removing our hand luggage. At that point we had no option than return to the terminal. After 3 hours we received our first and only light meal for the Costa Coffee and a hotel accomodation. Nobody wanted to get stuck in Sliema because of lack of transportation (it has not been offered to us) on Christmas day so the majority decided to sleep on the ground or in the seats of the Costa Coffee in the airport. At 5 am we queued at the check-in, we received our boarding pass and we arrived in Comiso at around 8.30 am on Christmas day; from Comiso a shuttle bus brought us to Catania airport, were our parents were waiting for us. We arrived at destination with more than 20 hours delay, we stood up on our feet for more than 8 hours, we did drink for more than 5 hours, we did not eat for more than 9 hours, we will never trust Air Malta again.

### "would not recommend this airline"
First time flying with Air Malta from Frankfurt to Malta and Malta to Berlin TXL using their old A320 and A319. I would say, this airline is worse than low-cost airlines serving the same route. My both flights delayed about 20 minutes. Nevertheless they arrived in-time as scheduled. What I have paid for the ticket was not equal to the service which I got. Drinks and snacks for the economy passengers are for a fee. The seats were dirty. I assume as their Airbus was a lease plane. Hence, I would not recommend this airline to fly to Malta. Better to have a stop-over but good services.

### "never fly Air Malta again"
Rome to Malta. Was charged 90 Euro per bag at check in. There was no mention of an extra charge for checking in a bag and 90 Euro for each bag is just crazy. Will never fly Air Malta again.

### "I wasn’t impressed"
Gatwick to Malta. I wasn’t impressed with the airline at all. Firstly we were delayed. The airplane itself was 20 years and in bad condition. It however was a wet lease plane so there was no branding inside or any livery on the plane. The staff was weren’t great but weren’t awful, however they were below average. Then on arrival the pilots completely messed up taxiing to the gate. I decided against flying with a LCC as it’s the Xmas period I wanted more of a relaxing and customer friendly flight, none of that is what I received.

### "customer care non existent"
Vienna to Catania. Their customer care is non existent, our plane was diverted from Catania to Malta for unspecified technical problems. 70 people including kids left with no support for 6 hours overnight in an indecent airport,  no manager showed up and nobody of their ground crew had an idea of what was going on!

### "exception based on nationality"
This is the worst experience ever! I was flying to London and I only had the hand luggage with me. Before boarding, the girl asked me to check the size of my hand luggage and because it didn’t fit she decided to send it in the back. she asked another person to check the size of his hand luggage and same as me, it didn’t fit. But, the guy refused and he passed with his hand luggage. When I asked the girl why is this guy allowed and I am not, she said ”he has expensive staff in it” I was shocked, I said I have expensive staff as well, i will make a complain, and I want my hand luggage. She refused, saying first, the guy is from Malta and if You keep asking for explanations, she won t let me boarding anymore. I have been travelling with this hand luggage all over the world, and none of the airlines complained about the size! She shouldn’t do exception based on nationality!

### "In a word - awful"
Munich to Malta. Old, shabby aircraft, average cabin service, no in-flight entertainment. Lost luggage for about 50 passengers! Only one person on baggage services desk, processing people very slowly. First time with this airline, but never again. In a word - awful.

### "it's been going down-hill"
London to Malta. Air Malta management has lost the plot! As a frequent flyer, I used to find the airline fairly acceptable even though somewhat expensive. Sadly it's been going down-hill for a while and it has now hit rock bottom. Aircraft are shabby, service is not to standard and boarding at Heathrow chaotic. I am often forced to fly this airline due to circumstances but I definitely will fly with alternative carriers wherever possible. Wake up Air Malta and get yourself back in shape.

### "child's car seat broken"
We reported our child's car seat broken to the partner company at Vienna Airport. They processed everything normally within about 3 weeks and told us to send in our original documents and wait for a response from Air Malta. That was 5 months ago, and nothing has happened since. Not only that, but phone calls end up nowhere. I have been referred to three different phone numbers by Air Malta employees, and the last one told me that the people who are now handling my case do not have a phone number. Only an E-Mail Adress, to which I have sent a few polite E-Mails over the last weeks (not in the tone of this review, but rather in a simple enquiring manner), but never received a response. I know that baggage compensations are mostly a service and not a legal requirement, but if an airline doesn't do it, I will simply not use their services anymore.

### "Worse than Ryanair"
Malta to Heathrow. Travelling with my family, our takeoff was delayed 204 minutes without reason being offered though, when asked, a member of staff said "operational issues". About an hour of that 204 minutes was locked onboard the plane waiting for a takeoff slot. Of course, everyone was tired and bored but - and I mean BUT - the crew made things worse! No information was given, no pleasantness or courtesy was shown. They were just plain rude. And, despite the over-3-hour delay, they didn't even offer water at any point until nearly an hour into the flight. I should add that if you had paid extra to fly business class, your experience would have been better. The bulk of us in economy could see the senior steward serving the 5 (five) business class flyers with drink and food, quite repetitively while the rest of us just waited for water. And the senior steward does know how to smile! He just switches it off when he enters economy class. Really bad. Worse than Ryanair.

### "no one even tries to smile or help"
Frankfurt to Malta. Firstly my flight was delayed. Twice. No information, no notification. Secondly, they changed my seat. Twice. No information, no notification. The second time I was already in the plane and then they just said that I have to take another seat. Our plane has some technical problems. Well, it happens. But do you think they told us something? No, all the passengers were leaved in the busses, without any information and without air conditioning. In the middle of the airport (believe me, it was very loud!). The seats are very close to each other. And I am a small person. My husband just had no space. So, they can’t solve the problems, they are not informing passengers, the plane is not comfortable, no one even tries to smile or help you. Will I fly Air Malta again? Never.

### "one of the better airlines"
Malta to Bristol. The staff were friendly and professional nothing was to much trouble. Seating was very comfortable and the aircraft clean. Impressed with the complimentary light snack and bottle of water. Prices of the inflight service were reasonable. I would highly recommend flying with Air Malta one of the better airlines I’ve flown with.

### "service is as great as before"
Malta to Gatwick. The experience was pleasant. Staff are very friendly and hospitable. Even though Air Malta moved into the low cost market, service is as great as before.

### Air Malta customer review
I fly this route from Malta to Amsterdam almost every week and try to avoid Air Malta as much as possible but sometimes this is not possible, even prefer an indirect flight over a direct Air Malta flight. Recently additional surprises occurred. For months now when flying Air Malta you get a Latvian old lease Boeing, no room, fully booked.

### "excellent flight"
London Heathrow to Malta. Excellent flight. My only commment is that boarding was chaotic. Boarding should be according to seat numbers with rear seats to be occupied first. Passengers should be asked to be seated until there numbers are called. Also elderly and children should board first. Otherwise one of the best flights I have had.

### "I got what I paid for"
Amsterdam to Malta. Had relatively low expectations but the airline delivered for me. My flight was only 30 mins late. Seats were very close together, provided snack was nasty, but the price for my flights was very cheap. I got what I paid for. Would use again, especially if the price was right again.

### Air Malta customer review
Flew Amsterdam to Malta. I always try to avoid Air Malta if possible, unfortunately sometimes I do not succeed. I prefer an indirect flight instead of a direct Air Malta flight. Air Malta is not cheap but has bad service. Unfriendly staff, bad spread of seats. Very expensive additional luggage fee. Poor food, legspace very limited and no internet check in. Try to avoid if possible.

### "joins the race to the bottom"
When flying from Brussels to Malta on December 27 I was once more confronted with the total incompetence of Air Malta. Official Air Malta luggage voucher was not recognized (by incompetent check-in staff) and caused a 30 min delay at check-in. Special sized luggage did not arrive with the flight (they said, but very probably badly handled by incompetent luggage handlers at Malta Airport). This is my conclusion because was found back before any other flight from Brussels arrived. Air Malta was not capable to make the late luggage delivery in time (before 17:00) driver could not be reached, and after 18:00 nobody of Air Malta answers any phone. Only after 19:00 the luggage was delivered by a driver that was not even capable to ring a doorbell or use a mobile phone, but made his presence clear by claxonning. I did not receive any calls back after 18:00 from Air Malta, so there is a general incompetence to pass any messages between staff, or even in a general sense. So even with staff quality Air Malta joins the race to the bottom of the cheapest airlines.

### "was very disappointed"
London Heathrow to Malta was delayed but flight was OK apart from small snack and a bottle of water on offer and seat 14C not staying upright. Ground service far more professional than in Malta. Flight from Malta to LHR was a different story. Delayed by one hour but was not informed why until we boarded the flight and was told it was due to industrial action by the cabin crew. Remarkably found myself on the same plane and seat so seat was not upright during take off and landing - staff were not unduly concerned by this. Food appalling, ham and cheese square on stale bread and a bottle of water. If we return to Malta would find it difficult to use this airline again. Only reason I booked Air Malta was because I only use scheduled airlines rather than the dreaded low cost ones, and was very disappointed.

### "Aircraft itself was old and shabby"
Highly disappointed. Terrible service. Booked 7 months before the departure date to fly to Malta, received a phone call 5 weeks before the flight date to be told it was no longer direct and we had to fly via Germany, Munich and have a 3 hour wait each way. We purposely booked from Manchester because it was a direct flight and we had booked travel and accommodation before and after the flight, so that we could fly directly from Manchester. I asked if we could change to another airport to therefore fly direct and be compensated for the other bookings lost and they said this was not an option. Take it or leave it basically. Customers service said they couldn't offer any good will or compensation upgrade etc. I will not be booking with them again. They sold a product, then changed it only 5 weeks before with no other offerings or compensation. Aircraft itself was old and shabby with very little room. Business class also looked very disappointing, only a curtain to separate the area and priority boarding are only clear differences. Not worth the extra cost.

### "Very unfriendly staff"
London Heathrow to Malta. Probably one of my worst flight experiences. Very unfriendly staff, poor food and ordinary, old seats in business class. My luggage arrived at the day of my return flight, and when I requested a compensation of 65 EUR for new clothing, with the receipt included, they started to make a big issue over this by e-mail as I did not keep a document which they told me I wouldn't need. Furthermore this document is printed from their own system.

### "attitude of the staff was at best poor"
I have been visiting Malta since 1985 and used several airlines in the early days it was Air Malta but they became to expensive. In 2006 I had a work accident that left me with a disability that I can not climb stairs as not able to bend my left leg and need extra room as need my leg in a semi straight position. I am however quite able to walk around a plane. All other airlines such as Monarch and EasyJet as I have a letter from my consultant supply me with an extra leg room seat free of charge. Not this company. I telephoned direct to pre book extra leg room seats on the plane and was told I had to pay this. I explained no other companies charge, the answer was we do. So to stop an argument I paid. What a con they had booked me standard seats not extra leg room and charged me for this I could have booked them myself when we got the boarding passes online. The service on the plane and attitude of the staff towards disabled people was at best poor.

### "aircraft are old, shabby and dirty"
What a disgrace this sad little airline has become. I fly regularly between Amsterdam and Malta several times a year and unfortunately Air Malta is the only direct option. Air Malta's aircraft are old, shabby and dirty and the leg room is pathetic! Because their economy product is so abysmal I recently decided to travel business class, what a joke! Firstly their is no business class check in lane at Amsterdam airport so this means queueing with everyone else. After waiting for over 30 minutes, I finally arrived at the business class check in counter. Why have a check in counter for business class but no separate check in lane? When I enquired about this I was met with a shrug and giggles, pathetic. Once onboard, the seat (1A) was filthy and the window covered in fingerprints and was so badly scratched I could barely see out of it. There was also rubbish stuffed between the seats. Amazingly to me there was no separation between economy and business, not even a curtain. This meant that the front toilet which is normally reserved for business class was open to everyone. For pretty much the whole flight there was a queue of passengers in the aisle. I paid over €1000 for my ticket and am absolutely shocked that this is what Air MALTA try to pass off as business class. For shame, what an absolute disgrace. This airline is an insult to the beautiful country of Malta and it's good people.

### "never received one apology"
The worst airline I have ever dealt with. Our flight was scheduled to leave Amsterdam at 11.30 and was initially delayed by 2 hours as our plane was in Milan undergoing repairs as there was a technical problem. After an hour of waiting and relocating to another departure gate, we were informed that our flight would not depart until 17.30. We returned to the gate at 15.30 and again our flight had been delayed until 18.30 and moved yet again to another gate. We never received one apology from the staff and were offered a voucher for a meal as compensation. Instead of 4 days in Malta our trip was reduced to 3 days owing to the 7 hour delay. Moreover, had we been informed earlier in the day that our flight would not leave until 18.30 we could have spent he day in Amsterdam rather than stuck in Terminal 2 in Schipol airport. I have used Air Malta before and experienced severe delays on this journey too. After these experiences, I will not use Air Malta again. No professionalism, no efficiency and no apologies.

### "a nice little airline"
Malta to London Heathrow on 16 February. Online check-in worked fine and showed up at the desk to get a paper boarding pass. Agent friendly and jovial - easy airport to get thru security and plenty of places to eat. Boarding the plane was nice as there are no jetbridges and we just walked from the gate to the plane. A320 with comfortable seats. After boarding mechanics got on the plane and there was a speaker that wasn't working so it took an hour to fix. In the mean-time a FA came to me and asked me to move from 7A to the emergency row window as he said they needed someone to sit there. Never been asked to move to an emergency row but was fine with it. Tons of legroom and a row to myself. Once airborne we were served drinks and a sandwich for free, then they came around with BOB. Just a moving map but enjoyed the views outside of Sicily and the alps. We landed 20 minutes late but quickly off the plane. Air Malta is a nice little airline - hope they continue to grow.

### "boarding card an error"
On my flight from Berlin to Malta Valetta I had a boarding card for the seat 2F issued by Air Malta. At the time of embarking on the ground staff checked and accepted my boarding card. When I sat down I realized that this seat is bigger than the others so I was happy. The stewardessess checked 3 times my boarding card and gave me back saying OK. At fourth time another steward asked my boarding card and said this is an error and I have to go to row 23 but she did not give me a new boarding card. She said that the plane was reorganized and row 2 was in fact Business Class, and I had an economy class ticket. After I was re-seated, nobody was at row 2!

### "lost a day of our holiday"
Flew Air Malta from Gatwick to Malta for the 1st time on 28 October. Flew with them as they included 20kg baggage and they had a mid morning flight as I hate to arrive any where after dark. Flight was due to leave at 1155. Display boards said gate information at 1105. Checked at 1105 and it now said information at 1715. Went to airline desk who were not that helpful only saying food vouchers would be provided. Finally took off at 1845 or thereabouts. Captain apologised said the Incomming flight had tech problems and that they had to change aircraft. The aircraft was clean, cabin crew friendly, one guy went out his way to help the couple in front of us with a child in distress. Inflight meal was a snack but fine when the flight is only 3 hours. Arrived at our hotel about 1230 am woke up late so effectively lost a day of our holiday. I guess these things can happen I had a similar experience with Thai Airways years ago, that caused us to miss connecting flights and taxis. Flight home no problems same clean aircraft good cabin crew. I would use them again and would not tell any one considering to fly with them not too. However I was disappointed in the lack of information at Gatwick and the indifference of the staff at the airline desk. I guess a lot of passengers will b claiming delay compensation under the EU 216/2014 rule myself included. Wonder how airlines make a profit on a flight when it goes like this one.

### "seats exceptionally small and claustrophobic"
Flew Air Malta, 7/10, Gatwick to Malta. What a disgrace. Plane late on arrival and they did nothing to speed up the turnaround. Seats (row 5) exceptionally small and clasutrophobic. Onboard staff in a bad mood and not good at serving. Sat behind the Premium seats which meant we had a twee red curtain drawn for the flight in case we offended these important beings. (There was only one man in this class on this flight). The stewards were so slow serving the snack - tiny roll and a bottle of water - so that when people needed the loo (we have to use the one at the back) we couldn't get to it. We therefore used the first class one and got told off by the stewardess. I quoted health and safety and suggested she looked at the rules and regulations. The only good thing about it was it was a short flight speeded up by an even shorter route. Never again.

### "7 hour delay, no communication"
This was the first time we have flown with Air Malta. I have to say this may be the last time too. Had a fantastic holiday until we got to the airport to come home and had a 7 hour delay, no communication on why or what was happening. When the information desk was asked they didn't know either. When they finally had some information all they said was 'it's a tech issue'. I know these things happen but it's the lack of communication all round that's most upsetting. Yes we had food and beverage vouchers. The plane was due to leave at 15.00 but we were late again leaving. The plane had seen better days that's for sure. The onboard snack had a lot to be desired, a roll and a bottle of water. A really disappointing day completely wasted sitting in an airport with no communication.

### "all in all a poor effort"
London Gatwick to Malta with Air Malta. What can I say, but all in all a poor effort on all fronts. Delayed leaving the UK (30 minutes) and seriously delayed leaving Malta (7hrs - having left the hotel at 6:30am to catch the 8:50am flight). We missed our connecting flight home and had to book a a subsequent later flight at an additional cost to us. They have a serious lack of communication, albeit we got vouchers for food and drinks. As always they will not comment on what exactly went wrong other than 'it went tech'. These things happen, but it would be nice to inform you as soon as possible and then keep you updated and just do it as required according to the EU rules and flight delays. Even when we were told the flight would be leaving at 3pm - that did not happen. The plane itself, looked tired it been through a lot. The seating cramped, when compared to our Island carrier - Aurigny and their Embraer E195 a regional carrier. How is this possible? Also, upon vacating the seat I noted how the cushioning remained depressed. Obviously a well used seat. Generally the interior of the plane although clean, it too looked dated. The lack of inflight entertainment is a poor effort. The food: poor effort once again, a filled bread roll and a bottle of water, I would rather not bother, in fact I didn't. When you consider Aurginy you will have at least a choice of soft drinks/tea/coffee and of course water. This is certainly not a experience I wish to repeat, it ruined a perfectly good holiday. Ultimately, if we ever returned to Malta, I will ensure my family and I choose an alternative carrier.

### "my first choice to Malta"
Rome to Malta. I fly with Air Malta quite often and I have always been completely satisfied with their punctuality. They are usually also the cheapest legacy carrier to get you to Malta, at least from Rome. They have a nice magazine called Il-Bizilla (Maltese for lace) providing interesting information. Planes feature small overhead screens with the usual airshow. Cabin staff are hit-and-miss and sometimes quite grumpy. Unfortunately, the aircrafts' interiors are also quite old. Seats are tired and on this particular flight, the seat pocket was still full of trash. Complimentary food consisted of a small roll (Maltese-style tuna sandwich) and a bottle of water with additional choices available against payment. Completely adequate for the 1h long flight. They are always my first choice when it comes to flying to Malta. I know that they are going through tough times, but cleaning the plane properly should not be too difficult.

### "cabin crew are very friendly"
Malta to Milan Linate - I frequently travel with Air Malta. It is a comfortable option and offers really good prices. Usually flights are on time, cabin crew are very friendly, I really like the fact that bags fly free and Air Malta gives you also a free snack (bottle of water and baguette). Will use this airline in the future.

### "Air Malta staff indifferent"
Flew EasyJet in February which was ok but used to prefer major airlines so flew KLM to Amsterdam (great) then Air Malta to Malta. So you pay top whack for this airline which used to be average a few years ago but now no hot meal or drink, hot drink available at an inflated cost and the tea was vile and no hot meal even at a cost, even Easyjet can manage this. What you do get free, and this is listed on the ticket as a meal, is a bottle of water with no cup and a roll, I was the only one of a party of four who ate mine. And so to the airport, no cases, Air Malta or Schiphol? Still waiting next day, should be here by 11 pm. Air Malta staff indifferent. Easyjet from now on then with no transfer, Malta still my favourite destination though.

### "perfectly adequate airline"
Munich to Malta. Good friendly service and on time arrival. The aircraft was modern and I liked the random Maltese facts painted on the inside of each engine. When I first sat down in my seat the plane had been configured wrongly and my economy seat was in fact in business class. Once the passengers were all seated the crew reconfigured the aircraft and moved the curtains further up. This meant that we couldn't see the screen displaying the safety and emergency procedures video. The food was very limited and if we wanted anything more including coffee there was an extra surcharge. Overall, though this was a perfectly adequate airline.

### "don't recall being as disappointed"
These guys really don't deserve to get your business. I tend to use many different airlines and also use low-cost airlines, accepting that I will receive less service for the money I paid. I had my struggles with some airlines, but I don't recall being as disappointed as I have been with Air Malta. First they cancelled my flight two weeks after I booked it - of course without letting me know any reason. I was lucky enough to get an alternative for the same day, stopping over in Munich. Besides the additional stop that was not even a detour, but was so early in the day that it got troublesome already (since we were staying at the neighbour island Gozo and having to catch a ferry before the flight). Four weeks later they inform me that even this new flight got rescheduled and starts even one hour earlier. When asking for an alternative flight the customer service lady told me that they won't offer me any alternatives as the rescheduling was less than two hours. When pointing out that my original flight was planned seven hours later, she said as I had confirmed the first change, I am no longer eligible for objecting against the change. So I have to accept every rescheduling from my changed flight plan if it is a change of less than 2 hrs. I had to let go off our last day on Gozo, had to find a new hotel near the airport (for a family of 5), had a ruined day with sleep-deprived kids and an endless wait at the connecting airport.

### "make sure you eat at the airport"
Back in the day Air Malta used to serve us a nice hot breakfast, lunch and dinner depending what time of the flight. Flew London Gatwick to Malta. Now the airline serve us a sandwich and a drink of water for free. Just to warn you in the future make sure you eat a lot at the airport. When I was younger Air Malta used to have inflight movies, now it's just a live map.

### "never use Air Malta again"
Having travelled with Air Malta since 1988 many times and recommending them,  I can no longer recommend them. I was due to travel to Malta in June 2015 but was unfortunately diagnosed with breast cancer and had to cancel my holiday. After contacting Air Malta and having to practically beg them, they agreed to hold mine and my partners flights so long as I travelled before 31st March 2016 and provided evidence which I did. I have recently finished my treatment and am now ready to travel. I phoned Air Malta to re-book and was informed that it was 80 euro for each of us to re-book. I explained that I had been off work for nine months and could not afford it and I would not be able to go and they said sorry, cannot help. I emailed customer service to be told the same thing. I could understand it - if I merely cancelled my trip but in the circumstances, they could and should be more sympathetic. I have been to hell and back this past year and to have to deal with this is so distressing. Air Malta does not care more as their logo States, it should say does not care less. I will never use Air Malta again.

### "happy with service"
I took return flights from Gatwick to Malta for a short vacation and was happy with service on both flights. The onboard and ground staff were polite and helpful. I appreciated the checked luggage allowance and the free onboard snack, something you often don't get in economy. The prices in their Sky Bar Menu for paid for food and drink were very reasonable also.

### "disappointed with Air Malta"
Very disappointed with Air Malta. Flew with my daughter and grandchildren from London Heathrow to Malta. Although flight departure was at 7 pm, we were only served a bread roll and bottle of water! Had to pay extra for any other snacks/drinks and they are very expensive. No entertainment whatsoever. This was quite an expensive scheduled flight [approx. £2,500 for 5 of us], and have had better cabin services from much cheaper budget airlines.

### "service appalling and unfriendly"
I was disappointed with Air Malta, the flight to Algeria was not a cheap one despite the short distance, one week before my flight they cancel it and fly me to Germany and transfer me to another airline from there. I found Air Malta service appalling and unfriendly, crew and ground staff tired and fed up, plane is new but a bit shabby, they only serve sandwiches on board with a tiny bottle of water!

### "not unusual to cancel flights"
This flight was to have been a direct flight from Malta to Venice booked in December 2014, for a June 11th 2015 departure, we were going to leave on a cruise from Venice. Five weeks before the date I was phoned by Air Malta advising my flight had been cancelled. This is not unusual for Air Malta to cancel scheduled flights and they were very clear they did not have to give me a reason. My options to replace this 2 hour flight was a total of 11 hours via the UK, or Vienna or another far off destination, which also meant I missed a day in Venice and had to pay Euros 138.00 just to arrive at my hotel at midnight. I was told no compensation either. My only other alternative was a refund. I managed to arrange for a flight via Rome. Taking a connecting flight with one of the Air Malta partners I would possibly fly with them if there was no other option, but a stand alone flight I would not.

### "cabin crew not a happy bunch"
Paris to Malta. The ground crew were very helpful at the gate since I did not have any seats assigned by Air France because their computers had a glitch. The cabin crew were not a happy bunch, your felt as though you had crashed their party. They did the minimum and one of them was actually quite abusive, apparently that is acceptable according to Air Malta management. The flight itself was smooth, on time and a nice landing. They should not waste their time serving the buns and water. Not my first choice to fly with taking into account the numerous other carriers available at the same or lower fares.

### "food is not very nice"
This Air Malta flight from Venice to Malta went well. The only problem is the ground crew at the airport did not call for boarding at any time. Fortunately we were sitting by the gate and noticed a last boarding sign. The flight was comfortable, on time, the crew on this flight was very nice and helpful. The food as usual a bun and water is not very nice. Because of other problems with Air Malta I would not fly with them again just because this flight went smoothly. I just can't take that chance again.

### "disappointed they have stopped serving meals"
Good clean comfortable aircraft, disappointed that they have stopped serving meals, although you do get a small baguette and a bottle of water. Very expensive for a flight in early Oct. Cost me over £320 pounds, Ryanair about half that price but I could not get to the airport. Flight back delayed for an hour which caused me problems.

### "I found Air Malta excellent"
I requested assisted boarding and seats together for my disabled husband and I, and they sorted it all within 24 hours. We found the Air Malta cabin crew very pleasant and efficient. The snacks of a ham and cheese roll and bottle of water may not have been a cooked meal, but were more than other airlines provide. Tea, coffee plus other drinks were offered for sale, as were snacks. All in all I found Air Malta excellent. We will fly again with them next year, hopefully.

### "Unfriendly and disinterested staff"
Air Malta flight, from Malta to Gatwick. The aircraft was showing its age Tight leg room. Unfriendly and disinterested staff on early flight.

### "cabin crew seemed dispirited"
The outward leg was on an A319, seats were narrow and the legroom very poor. The seat in front was about 9 inches away from my face and it was impossible to read a newspaper when the seat in front reclined. The food was a roll with ham and cheese and a bottle of water. In the past we had a hot meal, drinks and coffee, so this was a disappointment. The cabin crew in comparison to my previous experience seemed dispirited. The return journey on an A320, seemed slightly more space between seats but the dreaded ham and cheese roll with water was the only food on offer again. I read in the Malta times that they plan to reduce their fleet to 7 aircraft, this will surely result in long delays if one of their ageing planes has a technical faul. There is much written in the Malta press about their airline but surely a fleet of 7 is not viable. I would not fly with the airline again .

### Air Malta customer review
I have flown with Air Malta countless times in the past years. I can say, with all honesty that the airline has proven to become worse and worse every year. The evidence is not only in the small leg space available but the atrocious meal provided. A 4 hour flight to Moscow and only a sandwich and a bottle of water. It's abysmal. Air Malta used to provide hot meals with a choice of water, juices and soft drinks, and afterwards a cup of tea or coffee. What happened to this airline? I am sorry to say but nothing about it makes me want to use the service again. A note to the airline - It would be a good suggestion to pay just a little bit more for the flight and it would have a decent meal included.

### Air Malta customer review
Acceptable, but cabin showing it's age. Seats are a little tight, but good recline. Overhead Flight Map and Inflight Magazine acceptable for 2 hour flight. Water and a Baguette - stay away from the Tuna-fish Sandwich, the turkey one is fine. A big disappointment from their previous offerings. It would be better to stop serving rolls and replace them with a snack (peanuts, chips, ect) and soft-drink instead.

### Air Malta customer review
Long waits and delays, poor check in service, they had lost our booking. If you try to eat the cardboard bread roll you'll need the bottle of water, take your own inflight movie, as there is none.

### Air Malta customer review
KM4207, KM4206. 26th May - 2nd June 2015. Quite disappointed really with mix up and confusion. Flew from Cardiff, five of us travelling to Malta, got to check in and told that if we all want to sit together they would charge £25 per person. Lots of customers complaining! If you request extra leg room at a cost you will be in charge of the emergency exit, no one with any disabilities or under 16 cannot sit in these rows. I had a 14yr old and she was moved!

### Air Malta customer review
ORY to MLA and MLA to LIN. When I purchased the Air Malta flight ticket it stated a hot meal will be provided. But onboard I only received a bread roll and a bottle of water. I don't understand why this airline decided to downgrade their service it is not much different to travelling on a budget airline except you get a refreshment and a free piece of baggage. The aircraft livery is beautiful seat was comfortable for a short haul journey the only thing that might make me use them again is the location of airport they fly to.

### Air Malta customer review
20/2/2015-23/2/2015. Flight KM 612 to Rome KM 613 to Malta. I have flown with Air Malta from Malta to Rome Fuimicino and return to Malta. The flight was OK but food was very poor. The service which was provided in Rome was very bad: at the check-in the machine did not know how to fill in the boarding pass normally Be aware: a lot of students are flying on this route and they make a lot of noise especially during boarding.

### Air Malta customer review
Travelled to and from Malta this month. We cannot understand how the market research dept. have come up with the plan to remove the hot meal from this service. We travelled 2 hours to the airport 2 hours waiting and a 3.5 hour flight landed us in Malta about 11.30pm. All this time without a meal! I think it's Easyjet next time.

### Air Malta customer review
LGW to MLA and return - January 2015 - A320 both ways. Although online check in used there was no dedicated bag drop at LGW which somewhat defeats the point when you have to line up with those who have not checked in. Outbound flight left 10 minutes early and landed 25 minutes ahead of schedule. Air Malta have now discontinued a full meal service in favour of what they describe as a baguette and a bottle of water. The baguette is actually a small soft roll with very little filling. Due to a cabin crew dispute over crew meals being discontinued no hot or cold drinks or snacks could be bought. On the return the dispute has been resolved and a selection of cold snacks hot drinks and full bar service available at prices slightly lower than most low cost carriers. Return was about 15 minutes late. As both flights were lightly booked there were plenty of free seats which made the trip note comfortable but A320's are showing their age.

### Air Malta customer review
Manchester to Malta A319 22nd December 2014. Check-in was slow which was a bad start and it got worse. Our economy seats had minimal legroom and when the passenger in front put his seat back just after take-off I was trapped. There was no entertainment system other than a map showing the planes location and the meal of chicken curry with a bread roll and tiny mince pie was embarrassingly poor. For a scheduled flight it was pretty bad and the best bit was leaving the plane on arrival at Luqa.

### Air Malta customer review
MLA-LHR. Flown Air Malta many times but this was by far my best experience. Same price as flying Ryanair. Crew very courteous breakfast was standard and impressed that a European airline still serves hot meals. Only downside in my opinion is that the aircraft are showing their age on the interior in particular the seats. They are only 10 years old but a cabin refit would have been of more benefit to the airline than the paint job they all had lovely though it is.

### Air Malta customer review
The seats were so close together that it was difficult eat or read the magazines. My wife who had arthritis and osteoporosis had great difficulty getting out of the seat to go to the toilet. The distance from the front of my seat to the seat in front was only 9 inches. I feel that Air Malta has forgotten what passenger comfort means. I have been to Malta three times this year twice with Air Malta and once with Easyjet which was by far the most comfortable flight. As much as I would like to support Air Malta I am sorry but in future I will be travelling with Easyjet.

### Air Malta customer review
An airline in recovery as Air Malta apparently is I genuinely wonder how things were before. Service aboard was what I can only describe as lack lustre. No welcome in boarding a 15 minute late start with no explanation from the flight deck or crew. A simple explanation is all people need. Surly cabin crew who I presume took inspiration from British Airways of old and for whom eye contact of any sort seemed to be an abominable sin so never occurred as a consequence. The food onboard was 'interesting' - Lamb kebab or nothing. There was a vegetarian option which wasn't freely offered. It's little wonder 'the airline of the Maltese Islands' were unhappy at the prospect and subsequent arrival of additional low cost airlines hitting their passenger load factors. Why any full fare paying passenger would select Air Malta for any other reason than bare price is beyond me. On a positive note once the aircraft was off the ground the actual flight was good the seats were comfortable cleaning regimes could be improved but that's not hugely consequential. Arrival at the destination was on-time and the onboard flight tracking information was good.

### Air Malta customer review
Brussels-Malta in business. Flight on time comfortable seats with the middle one free. Pitch between seats just ok for a 2hr 45 flight. Separation between economy and business bring some privacy. We were only 2 in business. Pleasant crew service and food above average with starter main course cheese and dessert. Quality has been met. Good champagne and selection of wine. I want to encourage the company to continue in proposing such a good service for a European business flight. Business class saver fare: 562 euros for a return ticket.

### Air Malta customer review
FRA-MLA-FRA. Both flights on time. Impossible to make online check-in for flights from Frankfurt. Inbound flight from Malta was possible to make mobile check-in. They have a check-in counter for online checked-in passengers and no line exists. Another normal check-in counters are really long lines. Complementary chicken rice breads soft drinks and Maltese wines. Display on the ceiling was only flying map. Standard seat pitch on a legacy carrier.

### Air Malta customer review
Gatwick-Malta. Online check which makes things easier. Air Malta offer inflight meals even though the flight is usually less than 3 hrs not many airlines do that any more. The price of the tickets was cheaper than Ryanair. Plenty of leg room comfortable seats cabin crew were pleasant enough.

### Air Malta customer review
The only thing that was right was the time schedule. Seats were too close to one another I am only 165 cm tall and I barely had 3 cm left between my knees and the seat in front of me. Food was mediocre and the friendliness of the staff could be better. The seats with more space cost 50 euro per person per flight so were almost empty. The staff refused to allow taller passengers to take these seats unless they paid the full 50 euros. No more Air Malta for us!

### Air Malta customer review
Outbound to Malta we were towards back on plane luckily an empty row behind us allowed guy in aisle seat to move and allow more room cramped seats terrible food and drinks charged at cost - stewardess did not bring back my change either! Take off was creaky and bumpy an old plane! On way out item was stolen from suitcase. Return back to London seat was further forward and even more cramped no leg room at all one guy in row ahead could not put his seat forward limiting room even more. On top of this the plane was extremely hot and the air con was not working properly. Very uncomfortable and sweaty could see most passengers suffering. Food was average. Flight itself smooth and fine.

### Air Malta customer review
MLA-LHR-MLA. After a less than favourable review last month things improved significantly on this trip. Same crew were excellent on both legs and The UK Station Manager rang us on arrival at Heathrow to let us know one of our daughters had left their watch on the plane which was quickly retrieved and returned to us. Baggage arrival at LHR was surprisingly fast too. The Etihad lounge at LHR T4 remains Air Malta's trump card out of UK and on both legs we were not asked to weigh our hand luggage (as per last trip). A cynic might argue that having the Air Malta CEO onboard on the return flight may have helped matters but none the less the crew was attentive and the food more than bearable. Usual gripes about seat comfort remain but until Air Malta get new planes there is little chance of any improvement.

### Air Malta customer review
Flew Air Malta for the first time in a long time from Cardiff to Malta very good and efficient service. That's where it all stopped! Return flight shambles at loading disabled people and late departure. They rescheduled the flight to go to Birmingham and then Cardiff followed by having to leave the aircraft going all the way out to the airport departures back through customs/security and back onboard the aircraft all this while carrying hand luggage and pushing my disabled wife's wheelchair.

### Air Malta customer review
Malta - LHR- Malta. Having had some very good trips with Air Malta recently this last trip showed a marked fall in standards. On outbound flight from Malta hand luggage was weighed (first time this has happened in business class) apparently due to "a change in procedures". My ten year old daughters were asked their age in the La Vallette lounge despite having business class tickets and there was little room for luggage by the time we boarded the plane. Breakfast on board was a sad affair with the nasty frankfurter sausage having made an unwelcome return. The Crew however were fine. The return flight out of LHR was less joyous. We were treated to an unintentional and lengthy display of origami by the check-in agent writing folding our lounge invitations (Why cannot the boarding passes simply be used for lounge access?) and a whole wad of questions about my wife's visa which is perfectly valid. Thank goodness for the Etihad lounge - a truly professional and quality experience but the joy ended there. The flight was full and service was very slow with dinner not being served until we were well over Nice. When it came the chicken was tough and overcooked and the dessert was unrecognizable either by looks or by taste. The stewardess was stretched whilst the purser sat behind the curtain doing absolutely nothing until late into the flight. Wine and Champagne were all served in tumblers (a pet hate) and the seats themselves are very uncomfortable for a flight where most passengers want to sleep. Priority luggage on Air Malta is also a joke when it comes off with all the other luggage. This is not unique to Air Malta but on a recent Emirates flight it really worked properly. Flying again on 23rd to London so keeping fingers crossed that things will improve.

### Air Malta customer review
I'm just back from Malta having flown out and back from London Gatwick. Both flights departed promptly after smooth check in and boarding and arrived on time. Flying Airbus the seats were wider than I have experienced on recent economy flights with other airlines. The staff were friendly and the absence of attempts to sell unwanted items was appreciated. The provided means were pretty average but it was much cheaper to travel with them on my route than with Easyjet where food would have been an extra. I will certainly use them again and it is clear from a number of conversations that they have deservedly won many regular customers among the expat community.

### Air Malta customer review
LGW-MLA and return. Outbound flight 40 minutes late departing but no explanation offered. A320 was showing its age seat leather worn and sagging. Legroom was reasonable. The standard of food has deteriorated considerably since my last Air Malta flight 5 months ago - cold ravioli swimming in watery sauce. Staff fairly efficient and friendly. Return A320 was in slightly better condition but my seat refused to stay upright and slowly reclined on its own. Again cooked breakfast was poor - back to the frankfurters with dry scrambled egg and potato. Again late departure with no explanation. The most alarming issue was the lack of final checks by cabin crew on landing - one passenger continued to use an ipad right up to landing!

### Air Malta customer review
Manchester - Malta 20 Sep KM147. Malta - Manchester 27 Sep KM 146. Although the flights were both on time the legroom was non existent. Could barely read my book there was so little room. Staff OK and food not great. Will not be travelling on Air Malta again.

### Air Malta customer review
1 Sep LHR-MLA KM101 Business class. 10 Sep MLA-LHR KM102 Business class. Great service and smiles from all seats very good for short haul food very good row 1 A and C both directions. Business lounge great and very quiet.

### Air Malta customer review
Took two flights with Air Malta. One from Dusseldorf to Malta and Malta to Milan. First flight delayed for over an hour because they lost paperwork for two unaccompanied minors. They made those two girls stand for an hour and wait for the problem to be resolved. Second flight was delayed for over 4 hours. They didn't bother advising partners beforehand so we had to find out at our arrival at the Airport. Very poor customer service. I would not recommend the airline. Seats are filthy and old. Overall appearance of the aircraft is old and not in a good condition. I will not use this airline for my future travels.

### Air Malta customer review
FCO-MLA and return in May 2013. Flew economy was pretty good with better than average legroom and seat padding and width. Flights were on time which is always a plus and even on these short flights a snack was served. Cabin crew was efficient but very serious in demeanour. All in all a good value and would fly again.

### Air Malta customer review
What a lovely airline. Speedy check in and LHR - MLA business class and back economy but in row 10 with good leg room. Friendly and efficient both ways and totally on time.

### Air Malta customer review
Flew LHR to Malta and return. Out on a A319 with plenty of legroom which was great. Back on a A320 which was terrible. Legroom was non-existent. It was as if they tried to cram in as many people as possible. Very uncomfortable for the almost 3 hour journey. I could not even read the paper there was so little room. However both flights were on time and the crew pleasant. Food going out was fine but didn't eat on the way back.

### Air Malta customer review
KM 467 Paris - Malta 27 December 2012. Have been travelling with Air Malta over 8 years and never had any complaints. However during my last flight I was disgusted with the attitude of the air hostess who was very rude to the passengers - so unprofessional.

### Air Malta customer review
AMS-MLA return. Check-in in both AMS and MLA was friendly and 20 kilo allowed at no charge. A320 outbound via BRU was well maintained and cleaned on the intermediate stop. Snack bar and juice served on AMS-BRU and decent hot meal served on BRU-MLA and MLA-AMS along with drinks. Alcohol had to be paid for soft drinks etc free. Route map shown. Cabin crew - 5 of them were all rather unfriendly except Purser on way from AMS to MLA. Service on both sectors very rushed. All in all if you get a decent offer a good way to get to Malta. No audio available.

### Air Malta customer review
My son and I flew from Vienna to Malta last summer and had an enjoyable flight. We flew in from Riga Latvia on Air Baltic and connected with Air Malta. Flights were on time and our luggage checked through as published. Good food good service clean aircraft and a friendly staff. Couldn't ask for more. I wouldn't hesitate flying Air Malta again.

### Air Malta customer review
I've flown Air Malta quite a few times and it's gone downhill badly since my last trip with them. LHR-MLA and return. We flew in an A319 with as many seats as possible shoe-horned in. For a longer flight this would have been hugely uncomfortable and I'm by no means tall. Taller people were standing for large parts of the flight. There was a meal on both flights. The meal outbound was poor the meal on the return was inedible. The staff were as pleasant as they've always been no problems there.

### Air Malta customer review
As regular visitors to Malta we have always flown with a different airline but this time we decided to fly with Air Malta mainly because this year Air Malta was a lot more competitive on price than our usual airline. We flew out of Manchester to Luqa on 6th October and returned 13th October. After the excellent service we received we have decided to be regular travellers and look forward to booking in the near future.

### Air Malta customer review
LGW-MLA. At the risk of sounding like a record stuck in a groove this was the fourth Air Malta flight in two weeks which went very smoothly and efficiently. Check-in at Gatwick was instant and the revamped fast track facilities were as they should be. Plane left on time and arrived 15 minutes early. Service was friendly. Only gripe is that if you are sitting in row one there is nowhere to put ones bags as the overhead lockers directly above them are used by the crew necessitating stowing the bags slightly further down the plane which is a particular nuisance when disembarking.

### Air Malta customer review
Malta - LGW. Another smooth and efficient flight only marred by a faulty seat which had a mind of its own as to when it should recline. A major plus was that Air Malta had replaced the frankfurter at breakfast to something more like a breakfast sausage. On time arrival with speedy immigration and baggage reclaim at Gatwick.

### Air Malta customer review
LHR-MLA. The Etihad lounge at LHR Terminal 4 is a great way to start the journey and has both a buffet and a la carte breakfast. Service was slick and very professional. The flight itself was smooth with an excellent crew. Champagne was ice cold though the effect is somewhat lost when it is served to you in a tumbler. The Steward replied that Air Malta could not afford proper glasses due to its current restructuring though in the four years I have flown Air Malta this is one issue that has not yet been addressed. Food was tasty and plentiful very hot towels were offered and my traveling companion who was flying Air Malta for the very first time was impressed.

### Air Malta customer review
NCL-MLA on 31st July back 7 days later. I haven't flown Air Malta for several years and was worried standards would have dropped. In fact it hasn't changed much! Very slow check in at Newcastle and the hard sell from the check in staff to pre book our seats on return (we refused and saved £50). We had been told there were no free meals so the hot meal provided was a surprise and a bonus. Cabin crew were busy but helpful if you needed anything. It is a shame there is no in flight entertainment though. Several children were going stir crazy by the end of the flight.

### Air Malta customer review
Travelled to Malta from Exeter on 28 August and returned on 11 September. Delayed by over 3 hours on outward journey only explanation was "operational difficulties" and we were given a paltry £6 voucher to get a snack. Nothing else was offered not even free phone calls even though that is an entitlement. On the return journey we were gain delayed by 45 minutes because of "late arrival if the incoming flight". The flights were good once we actually took off but the whole experience was so tiring and stressful that we will never fly with Air Malta again.

### Air Malta customer review
MLA-LGW. This is Air Malta as it should be - quick check-in new fast track security lane at Malta Airport and on time departure arriving early. Service on board was courteous and efficient. Only two minor whinges over breakfast. Could we have something more akin to fresh orange juice and please replace the rather bland frankfurter type sausage with something more akin to a decent breakfast sausage. Looking forward to new livery in November and hopefully the new branding will cover the interior of the plane too. Still missing points which have not been credited from my Catania flight which was reviewed here on 2nd August.

### Air Malta customer review
Flying from Bristol to Malta on 3rd September we were removed from the flight due to Air Malta overbooking the flight. The first day of our holiday was spent in Exeter and was tedious boring and somewhat unpleasant and could hardly compare to Malta. Air Malta offered us a paltry compensation and expenses which in no way compensated for the lost of the first day of our 7 day holiday. Apparently we learnt this is common with Air Malta so watch out!

### Air Malta customer review
Returned 14th August from Malta to Birmingham UK with 5 hour delay with no explanation as to the problem no Air Malta representatives available to give any information until voucher given out for Light snack - a sandwich and a drink. Very poor customer care. Upon landing in Birmingham the usual comment of Thank you for travelling Air Malta and we look forward to seeing you soon was received with derision so you have lost even more passengers.

### Air Malta customer review
Catania-Malta. Had seats in row six pre-booked for this flight which had vanished from the system by the time we got to the check-in desk. The rest of my family were seated in row 21 and myself in a middle seat in row 17. This route is the only route where this problem has occurred and may be something to do with the plane coming in from Munich with passengers on board or lack of efficiency at Catania Airport. The check-in clerk told me to speak with the crew on boarding the plane as there were spare seats in row one but these were already occupied on boarding making any further conversation fruitless. To make matters worse my pre-assigned seat (17E) was occupied by someone else who was reluctant to move despite being in the wrong seat. The saving grace was that the flight was short and punctual. Overall and on the basis of many flights taken I would still recommend Air Malta but if this was my first and only flight I would probably not.

### Air Malta customer review
Manchester-Malta return. Very good flights cabin interior comfortable and clean. Drinks cost a lot less than the low cost airline. Cabin crew were attentive not obtrusive. I have travelled with Air Malta for twenty two years and find them to be the confident option.

FRA-MAL on Airbus A319. Flight on time crew were very friendly and smiling. The food was very tasty and consisted of chicken with mashed potatoes and a delicious cake. All in all I was very impressed with Air Malta.

DUS-MLA-DUS. Outbound leg: Online check-in not functioning long lines at check-in with only 2 check-in staff. At the gate the flight kept being delayed initially by 15 30 40 minutes and then 1 hour for a total of over 2.5 hrs. Ground staff disappeared no drinks no information. Eventually the flight was ready for boarding from an adjacent gate. The onboard experience was uneventful with charter-like service in a cramped cabin. The flight arrived at MLA 2.5 hrs late at almost 1 am. For the return leg online check-in worked well and so I went straight to the baggage-drop counter. Onboard the cabin was very cramped. The cabin crew seemed disinterested (no smiles whatsoever). For the often surly service offered by Air Malta I'd much rather fly a cheaper competitor with better legroom.

Manchester to Malta return. Outbound flight delayed by approximately one hour as was the inbound flight. The organisation at the departure gate in Malta was chaotic. Onboard cabin crew were unhelpful and offered no assistance to passengers. The safety briefing was all electronic and cabin crew took no part. Apart from the meal service cabin crew were hardly in the cabin. They appeared surly in manner and did not check passengers seatbelts before take off or landing.

### Air Malta customer review
FRA-MLA. Normally would use LCC. 20 minute delay in leaving held on a bus for the whole time. Cabin crew friendly with the exception of one uniforms dull and tired. Aircraft seats looked very worn considering the aircraft are relatively new. Food onboard good and free soft drinks and alcohol offered. Overall very pleasant but I can understand why people are switching to budget airlines.

Malta to AMS. Flight departed on time. FA served omelette and beverage. Staffs were friendly and helpful. The cabin was very clean.

### Air Malta customer review
Just arrived back to Heathrow from Malta. Everything went like clockwork very attentive friendly cabin crew great in flight food free newspaper. Recommend flying with Air Malta every time beats the competition.

### Air Malta customer review
Gatwick to Malta return Club Class. Both flights on time and inflight food and drinks service very good. Few business class passengers on both flights though. Servisair lounge at Gatwick was disappointing however La Valette Club ay Malta airport was modern with excellent selection of drinks.

### Air Malta customer review
We were disappointed at the decline in standards. Since our last flight the standard and quantity of food has reduced. On both outward and inbound flights the main meal was chicken on the return chicken in curry sauce with dried up rice. Previously free wine and beer was available this is now a thing of the past and we were only offered soft drinks. On the outward journey the cabin crew seemed disinterested the crew on the return were more customer friendly but were speaking to each other over the voice of the captain giving messages. Cabin crew uniforms are dull and appear old fashioned. Regretfully the whole experience was disappointing and not what we expected of a schedule airline.

### Air Malta customer review
Rome to Malta. I've flown Air Malta many times in the past but haven't for quite a while and was surprised to discover it still provided meals and drinks for such a short flight unlike most carriers. The flight attendants were friendly and attentive. The flight departed and arrived on time. There was a hitch at the airport with the departure gate changing and passengers not told - I think this may have been the fault of the airport not the airline. I have flown other airlines in and out of Malta before and have had problems but have always found Air Malta to be the most reliable.

### Air Malta customer review
LHR-MLA return in A320s. Air Malta still seems to provide a very "old-school" air service in that you still get a hot meal on short haul flights (over 3 hrs) for a reasonably competitive price. It was all very civilised. The cabin crew was pleasant professional and frequently smiled. The service comprised a meal then drinks round about 40 mins into the flight (alcoholic beverages and certain soft drinks are charged for) followed by a tea/coffee round. If you wanted any more drinks later you could ask the flight attendants who were visible throughout the flights. The niggles for this trip were not being able to check in online for flights from Heathrow whereas you could do so for most other origins and their 20 kg checked baggage allowance when most comparable airlines allow 23 kg. Nevertheless I would definitely use them again.

### Air Malta customer review
Malta-Gatwick Club Class. On arrival at the airport prior to the return to the UK we saw an offer regarding Club Class upgrades for €99 each on selected flights. We were delighted to discover this would be available on our particular flight KM0118 as it was in fact our wedding anniversary that day. We paid at the information desk and obtained the necessary receipts which we exchanged for Club Class boarding passes. Once on board the service did not appear as attentive as previously experienced and it became apparent when the food was served. When we queried why we had been given an Economy meal on a the mini tray whilst those around us had an overflowing tray of starters mains desserts plus cheese and biscuits etc. The Steward immediately produced the passenger manifest which described us as ‘involuntary upgrades’. As far as he was concerned we had obtained the upgrade for free and that there were only enough Club Class meals for the ‘paying customers’ so tough luck. The conversation with the Steward was very embarrassing and distressing for us in front of the other 4 passengers in the Club Class cabin who were acutely aware of what was going on.

### Air Malta customer review
Since my sister moved to live in Malta over 14 yrs ago my family and I have enjoyed twice yearly trips to Malta from Birmingham Airport. Having always flown with Air Malta all this time and enjoyed the experience apart from the odd delay on departure I was shocked to find out that Air Malta no longer fly from or to Birmingham Airport. Why is this? Now we have to make alternative arrangements to travel elsewhere (other destinations other than Malta) as we were spoilt by Air Malta and their professionalism care and attention to their passengers young and old.

### Air Malta customer review
Heathrow-Malta on time staff friendly and relaxed. Hot meal (nothing spectacular but we didn't expect much at this price) hot and cold drinks. Online check in available flying back from Malta but not flying from Heathrow. Can cost a little more than airlines such as Ryanair - but worth it.

### Air Malta customer review
Heathrow-Malta return on A320. Friendly and welcoming crew. Awful legroom and space but a complimentary hot meal served with cold drinks and later tea and coffee. Inflight entertainment for the 3hr flight consisted of a wildlife documentary. Overall experience was good but let down by handling agents at Heathrow who took 1 hour and 30 minutes after we had landed to deliver the bags.

### Air Malta customer review
We told them the connection between Terminal 5 and T3 on Sunday in Rome was too short. Our family of 6 was denied boarding because we were there 30 minutes before departure instead of 45 minutes and the seats were given to others. They promised if we missed that connection we could rebook on the next flight 11 hours later at their airport desk. Air Malta does not have a desk in Rome they rely on Lufthansa. But Lufthansa said they are authorized to sell but not rebook tickets and they were too busy rebooking their own passengers to help us. Air Malta did not answer their phones because the offices are closed on Sunday. Hotel concierge finally got an inside line and we were told that our entire itinerary was canceled because we missed the Rome connection. We had to buy replacement tickets. Air Malta refuses to reimburse the EasyJet tickets or the money we paid them for their flight we were not allowed to board. We found out later that Air Malta has a well earned terrible reputation.

### Air Malta customer review
Heathrow to Malta and back to Gatwick economy class. Flight just under an hour late leaving Heathrow due to the French air traffic strike but on time leaving Malta on return. Free Maltese newspapers given out on boarding and hot meal served which was basic but edible. Free soft drinks and alcoholic ones charged at £2.50. Inflight programmes shown on overhead screens but no headphones give out. Overall quite basic and could be improved considerably with little extras but still better then many other full service carriers.

### Air Malta customer review
Manchester to Malta return and encountered no problems. A320 on both flights with pleasant professional cabin crew. Both flights on time. Meals were basic but adequate for such a short flight.

### Air Malta customer review
Paris (CDG) Malta return. The inbound flight was delayed for 90 minsh without any explanation and boarding was a mess. Both flights on clean aircraft with enough legroom for the duration of the flight. Inflight tv but no headphones . Food edible except for the bread and ok flight attendants. Altogether an okay airline but nothing to write home about.

### Air Malta customer review
Third time I have travelled London to Malta with my family. Flight was excellent food fine and staff very helpful.

### Air Malta customer review
I recently flew from Copenhagen to Malta Via Amsterdam. Upon check in at Denmark I was told I had to check my bag all the way through to Malta as I had not much time when arriving in Amsterdam to transfer. When arriving at the gate in Amsterdam airport for my connection I was told I could not board as my bag had not been transferred from the flight I just came off! They said it was policy not to allow passengers to fly without their baggage! I was then left stranded in the airport without anybody from Air Malta to advise or assist me. I had to find a hotel in Amsterdam and then come back to the airport the following day. Next day SAS who had helped me the night before managed to book me on flights that night and told me the real reason I had been stopped boarding was due to overbooking of the flight! I am currently back in Malta trying to get refunded for all my expenses from Air Malta who will barely respond to my emails. Draw your own conclusions for this but be prepared for the worst.

### Air Malta customer review
Catania - Malta. Queuing at Catania a complete mess and took approx 45 minutes. Once on board allocated seats in row two were filled by two pasengers travelling through from Frankfurt. Had to wait with whole family including two tired seven year old daughters until all passengers boarded and then load supervisor arrived to sort things out for us. Purser was very apologetic but unable to do anything until load supervisor could sort things out. Flight otherwise uneventful until the hardest of landings I have experienced in 40 odd years of flying. No apology or comment from flightdeck or cabin crew on this which was a little disconcerting.

### Air Malta customer review
Flew Air Malta to Rome. Outward flight was cancelled by Air Malta with the reason that there was an airport strike in Rome Fiumicino. Interestingly enough there was another flight to Rome Fiumicino with another airline departing an hour later that left as scheduled without any delays etc. Air Malta offered re-routing on another of their flights departing 8 hours later but did not give us any vouchers for meals or snacks or rerouting on an earlier flight with another airline as stipulated by EU law. According to them it was not their fault that the flight was cancelled and therefore we were not entitled to anything. Check-in staff helpful both in Malta and Rome Staff at ticketing desk and cabin crew could not care less about our situation or about the passengers in general. The flights were rather uneventful. Meals can be hardly called dinner or lunch as they consisted of half a sandwich and a small water container (100ml). On the way back we had stopover in Reggio Calabria airport which took about an hour during which about 20 passengers got off and on the aircraft. Would not recommend Air Malta for this route as it is currently being served by much more competitive airlines offering direct routes.

### Air Malta customer review
I also contacted Air Malta regarding the Volcanic Ash Problem. Sent them a letter by recorded delivery and have not received any acknowledgement. Have also e-mailed them several times in addition to sending them requests via their feedback form on their website. Have not received any response at all! I do intend to pursue this but will never fly with them again if this is how they treat customers.

### Air Malta customer review
I have contacted Air Malta re stuck in Malta during Volcanic Ash problem. I wrote to Air Malta five weeks ago and have not even been sent an acknowledgement. I have e-mailed and have been ignored. This is not what I would call customer service.

### Air Malta customer review
London-Malta. I wrote a review in June last year on Air Malta which included my comments that we had booked Club Class but the cabin crew were on strike and so there were limitations on what we were served during the flight. I wrote to Air Malta and they gave us a free upgrade on another flight to Malta which we accepted and we have just returned from a short break there. We were allocated seats 3D & 3F on both flights and these were perfectly acceptable. There is no middle seat in Club Class which gives extra space for books papers and other flight paraphernalia. Service was excellent food was of a decent quality and the drinks offered were very acceptable. Our bags were priority tagged at both airports and arrived quickly in Malta not so quickly at Heathrow. We were also given access to the Executive Lounge at LHR via the Club Class tickets but not at Luqa airport fortunately we have Priority Pass membership so gained access using our cards. I would use Air Malta again and feel they deserve credit for offering us an upgrade without it being a long drawn out negotiation.

### Air Malta customer review
Malta-Manchester-Malta. Ok flight out but hot main course proved a mystery to many passengers. It looked like lasagne but was supposed to be a cottage pie though did not taste like one. Why does Air Malta continue to offer in flight films/documentaries yet does not offer passengers headsets or even announce that you can use your own. On the return flight food was better but crew offered the bare minimum of service - no smiles read the newspapers for much for the flight and even curtained off row one so they could use it as a rest/reading area. Air Malta always provides a reliable product but its service lacks flair and imagination in the main.

### Air Malta customer review
Malta-Munich Business class Hamburg - Malta Economy class. Brilliant business class service with fantastic cheery service from the purser. Champagne offered mid flight too without having to ask for it. Code share on to Hamburg with Lufthansa worked a treat with aircraft parked next door. Return flight from Hamburg Ok but on less spacious aircraft with more tightly packed seating than most other Air Malta planes. Food very average and row one occupied by Air Malta crew.

### Air Malta customer review
Not bad however not good either. Airline doesn't provide blankets or headphones and the In flight entertainment is non-existent. The food is not bad at breakfast or dinner. However the A320 lacks from space and you can't use a laptop (even if small) due to the lack of space. The crew is professional however not friendly at all. Don't expect smiles during the inflight service.

### Air Malta customer review
Clean comfortable aircraft with reasonable leg room in economy. Food extremely mediocre but what do you expect on an economy budget. Reasonably pleasant cabin crew. Flights on time.

### Air Malta customer review
Flight good but you only find out how good a company are when you experience problems. During the recent Volcanic Ash crisis Air Malta offered no help at all to it's customers on outbound flights from Malta to UK. Air Malta provided nothing at all. We were left stranded and had to fund everything ourselves. To date they have failed to reply to all correspondence. They have completely disregarded the European directive relating to compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and cancellation or long delay of flights. I would never ever recommend this company.

### Air Malta customer review
When I arrived at check-in I asked for an aisle seat as I suffer from claustrophobia. The check-in attendant made a sarcastic remark along the lines of 'you must be a joy to travel with' which I thought was unnecessary and rude. When I got on the aircraft I found that I had been given a window seat! I do not believe that it was an innocent mistake and if it had not been for a man who agreed to change seats with me I would have had to get off the 'plane. The flight itself was good and cabin crew very pleasant.

### Air Malta customer review
MLA-VIE. Attentive cabin crew and announcements from the cockpit kept passengers informed. Food acceptable for duration of the flight. Seat pitch comfortable for a short sector and comparable to any european airline. Will certainly recommend to anyone.

### Air Malta customer review
Air Malta from LHR T4. Apart from lack of airline lounges I see Air Malta to equal BA Club Europe for onboard service. Seats were comfortable 3A/C and 1D/F legroom ok plenty of drinks food excellent - great value for money in discounted business out/business back and friendly service. Overall a great flight on holiday for Xmas & New Year but equally good for business travellers.

### Air Malta customer review
LHR-MLA-LHR. Check in was OK both legs. Outbound was on time inbound was delayed more than one hour. Food was bland and need to pay for wine etc but soft drinks free. IFE is basic. Overall for a short flight it was OK and reasonable value for fare paid.

### Air Malta customer review
Rome to Malta via Air Malta. When we arrived 3 out of 4 bags checked in didn't make it. We were told by baggage claims we would receive 58 Euros as compensation if we didn't receive our bags within 24 hours. 48 hours later we got two more and the next day got the third. Now I'm back in the USA and they say that's not their policy and I'm yet to find their policy anywhere. Definitely a bad taste to an otherwise pleasant vacation. No more Air Malta flights for me. I'm not even going to comment on the food or delays at the airport in Rome. Probably while they were taking our luggage off to load something else.

### Air Malta customer review
LGW-MLA-LGW Second time on this service this year. Hot lunch outbound is slightly improved with bigger main course but dessert now replaced with a tiny bun. Hot breakfast has been cut back - one hotdog sausage a spoon of watery egg and a few baked beans. IFE also cut back to old nature programmes but no headphones! Crew efficient but not particularly friendly. A319 out A320 back clean with reasonable legroom. Swissport check-in at LGW painfully slow as usual Air Malta check-in at MLA very quick.

### Air Malta customer review
Flew LHR to Malta in economy. Going out we had exit row seats with good pitch. Cabin crew not particularly friendly but ok. Food not very good. Coming back we had row 6. It was so cramped. Everyone was complaining. I'm 5'8" and spent the entire flight with my knees in the seat in front - and if I moved them either the cabin crew or trolley bumped into them. So I had 3.5 hours cramped in a really uncomfortable seat. The cabin crew were even less friendly. I and my neighbours was offered a second coffee but when the senior steward saw what the other steward was doing told her off!

### Air Malta customer review
Heathrow to Malta and back economy class. Sat in over wing exit seats both ways so plenty of leg room. The cabin was clean and crew attentive. Free newspaper given out on boarding aircraft. Air Malta seem to be cutting back - while you get a hot meal and free alcoholic drink you only get a small bread roll and tiny dessert. The previously shown movies have been replaced by documentaries and no headphones are given out. Online check in from Malta was painfully slow.

### Air Malta customer review
LHR-Malta-LGW August Bank Holiday weekend. The inflight service was good and we were pleasantly surprised with free wine with dinner. The ground service at Heathrow was terrible however. They wouldn't seat my girlfriend and me together despite having made the booking together and wouldn't accept my CSA Czech Airlines OKPlus card for frequent flyer points. The check in attendant and her supervisor claimed Air Malta and Czech Airlines weren't air partners despite both airlines' websites saying so. I complained after the flight to Air Malta but never heard back. They could do with an improvement to their ground service.

### Air Malta customer review
Malta-Rome return. Two very pleasant flights with Air Malta. Both departed on time and arrived early. Sensible inflight snack served in a box which was more than adequate for a one hour flight though somewhat strange that no hot drinks available on return flight Luggage retrieval at Rome a bit of a let down but overall a hassle free experience.

### Air Malta customer review
Frankfurt to Malta return. Excellent check in and swift baggage return. Basic economy seats and service. On time for all flights helpful staff. At the price I dont expect more.

### Air Malta customer review
MLA-LGW Business and BHX-MLA Economy. Good flight in Business class with attentive service and early arrival in LGW. Return flight punctual yet on one of Air Malta's all economy configured aircraft with seemingly less leg-room. Seat comfort is not good. Food service very basic and no service for first 90 minutes due to turbulence. Air Malta are now showing documentary films (Australian Dingoes and Turtles) instead of full length movies though headphones were not offered on the Birmingham flight making the whole point in having films somewhat futile especially as the industrial action by cabin staff is supposed to be over.

### Air Malta customer review
LHR-MLA return in economy. Very disappointed with Air Malta service No tea & Coffee no alcohol and no prior notice of this. In-flight entertainment was shown but no headsets were offered! Good seat pitch though so at least something was good. Overall service very poor will avoid in future and travel with alternative airlines.

### Air Malta customer review
We were first time flyers with Air Malta. We upgraded to Club Class as we were holidaying without our children and wanted to treat ourselves. We had seats 1D/1F on our outward flight and the first inkling that something was wrong was when we were only offered orange juice or water as we settled into our seats. As we were taxiing for take-off the stewardess announced that due to industrial action the crew would not be serving tea coffee or alcohol. As we had been expecting an open bar with champagne included this was very disappointing. The lunch I was served I didn't eat which is actually a first for me I always eat the food served on airlines. On our return on 12th June we took our seats in Club class seats 1A/1C. Again as we prepared for take-off it was announced about the industrial action so no tea coffee or alcohol would be served. There were some very disgruntled passengers onboard and we were also not happy. There was nothing obvious on their website - I had found a small article dated 30/5 and we were not advised at check-in about this situation. I'm not sure if passengers could have taken their own alcohol onboard and drunk it - but being aware of the situation would have been the decent thing to do.
