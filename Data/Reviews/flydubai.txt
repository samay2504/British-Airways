### "below the standards expected"
Medina to Calicut on 11 April 2025. We were a group of four, including children, and unfortunately, the journey fell far below the standards expected from an international carrier. The food provided was poor, no in-flight entertainment for kids unless we made additional payment, headphones were not provided and were only available for purchase, Blankets were not available:

### "Very poor experience"
Not Verified |  Very poor experience, first my luggage was lost. After 2 days when I got message from Jeddah airport to come and collect luggage. One suitcase is totally damaged. I raise my concern and put claim but no one giving me any response. Now I have to buy new suitcase.

### "one of the worst airlines to fly"
Flydubai used to be an ok airline to fly, but it has turned into one of the worst airlines to fly. Arbitrary selection of bags allocated to as checked in the gate, no justification, rude employees, no priority boarding when they claim so, and all this for the worst value for money in the market. Pretending to be a low cost airline when there is no competitors and paying 600 or 700€ for a 45 minute flight? Avoid it if you can.

### "Avoid this airline at all costs"
Avoid this airline at all costs. I booked and was unable to book baggage online 24 hours in advance. When I got there , to check in a bag is the cost of a flight 1000 AED. There was no other options, non refundable so I ran in circles for 3 hours figuring out what to do with my luggage. In the end I chose storage for half the price and traveled without my stuff , only to have to return to grab it after the trip. It’s a total scam.

### "demanded a fee for my laptop bag"
During my transit in Dubai on a Riyadh to Multan flight, their staff demanded a fee for my laptop bag, claiming only one hand-carry was allowed. When I resisted and asked for a supervisor, they changed their tone, acting as if there was no issue. This kind of behavior is unacceptable and feels like an attempt to exploit passengers. I do not recommend Flydubai for South Asian destinations!

### "very poor customer service"
Flight FZ 708 on February 2nd 2025 between Baku and Dubai and I was provided with very poor customer service by the flight attendants. One was very arrogant and needs more customer service training in how to be courteous to passengers. The toilets were not clean, and they did not provide sufficient assistance to passengers when necessary.

### "6 months of them ignoring messages"
Never choose fly Dubai! They cancel flights and it’s impossible to get your money back 6 months after they cancelled my flight, 6 months of me trying to get a cent back, 6 months of them ignoring messages Actually a month ago their customer service confirmed a refund, however turned out a month later they didn’t issue it and were very surprised I was promised a refund. At the beginning they tried to lie that they booked me another flight and their records “show” that I have boarded that plane. If you want to fly to your destination and not just feed them your money while being stressed - don’t those them

### "90s-style full-fare product"
Not Verified |  Boarding in Sofia via aerobridge. Departure on time. Standard seats surprisingly adequate (and I am 6'5"). Mature, polite, helpful crew. A nice meal with metal cutlery included. Followed by a coffee & tea service. All in all, a 90s-style full-fare product. Totally exceeded my expectations. The only disappointment was that viewing films/TV or playing games on the personal screen required purchasing a "package" of content access.

### "comfortable travel experience"
Not Verified |  Flydubai provides a pleasant and comfortable travel experience from Dubai to Kerala. I am 6 feet tall, so I had plenty of leg room. The food was tasty and sufficient and the service was good. The positive experience is made better by effective boarding.

### "very bad seats"
Worst airline, poor service, very bad seats, unprofessional staff. They take money for premium seat then you find very tight uncomfortable seat. Staff doesn’t care for passengers

### "a miserable scam of an airline"
I bought an Emirates ticket from Salzburg to Chennai via Dubai and return. I tried my best to book extra baggage, but could not, because nobody could tell me the cost, either on the telephone or via email, so I eventually abandoned that and left one suitcase behind. Not even at the check-in counter in Salzburg could they tell me, what it would have cost! The flight was half empty, the food served was miserable, entertainment had to be paid for, the staff was only interested chitchatting among each other, as if we did not exist, not even water was offered. To add insult to injury, when we reached Dubai, we taxied to our destination for ever and then travelled for 40 minutes by bus to the arrival gate. I have a return ticket in February and have to brave the flight from Dubai to Salzburg again and I dread it. This is certainly the only time I will fly flydubai, ever. What a miserable scam of an airline.

### "staff was courteous and welcoming"
Not Verified |  Nice atmosphere, friendly staff and excellent hospitality. The staff was courteous and welcoming, the food was good and hot and there are drinks to choose from. The lounges are good, the service provided was great and checking in is simple . Early landings and timely flights.

### “plenty of room to stretch out”
Not Verified | Business class-enjoyed a drink of champagne and some refreshments upon taking a seat and there's plenty of room to stretch out. Particularly on their trips from Dubai. An amazing collection of English-language movies spanning every possible genre.

### "barely managed the exchange"
Won't comment about services, it is low cost airline. But we bought single ticket from Flydubai Prague to Kathmandu with exchange in Dubai. There were 3 hours for exchange. They delayed the flight from Prague, then we barely managed the exchange because of bad organization on Dubai airport and we arrived in final destination without luggage. Doing Everest trek without your gear is impossible. Was not able to get any relevant information from the company. Finally we had spend a 2 days waiting for my backpack, ruined the schedule. From the part of flydubai there was no reaction, no excuse.

### “no clear standards”
There are no clear standards dealing with cabin luggage out of different stations. The staff (agent and station manager) in Dammam. For 1 extra kilo, they insisted I have to check in my cabin bag or pay extra.

### “kind and attentive”
Not Verified | The personnel made us extremely welcome and was quite professional, kind and attentive to the travellers. For me, selecting my extra legroom seat in economy is definitely worth the extra money. The flights were on time except for a short delay with transfer passengers in Dubai and the crew were efficient, friendly and polite. I rating them five stars. Most surely we will book again.

### "Totally a bad experience"
Not Verified |  Very poor plane access, completely overpriced vs the value of the trip. Simply not good, the poor experience start with the crowded and low service terminal, the long wait, the long drive by the bus to the plane while over packed. Totally a bad experience

### "found our bag completely broken"
It was the first time for me and my husband to fly with this company and it will surely be the last. First of all it was not possible to charge any device on the plane and the screen was inactive. Luckily the crew has been so nice to all passengers, also entertaining us all with kindness and support. But the worst has been about luggage. We never had a problem in the past but with Flydubai we found our bag completely broken! And we had to buy a new one in Dubai to continue our itinerary. Here attached the photo of the damage and the receipt of the new luggage. Hopefully they will reimburse us at least the bag.

### “Happy with the services received”
Not Verified | Happy with the services received. The food was ok. Vegetarian was my choice. The in-flight entertainment which featured movies in a number of regional Indian languages was the best part. The restroom was clean. Suggested!

### "probably not use again"
Flight was ok. Only 15 mins late. But no free water or drink that is ridiculous for what I paid. Staff was not overly friendly or welcoming. Would probably not use again as there are much cheaper options.

### “personnel friendly and accommodating”
It has been a while since my last flight on FlyDubai. My father in the Business class had a leg injury. Business class has always been his Just Love Flying with Flydubai service. The personnel was friendly and accommodating. The cuisine tastes good as well. Though it was nothing unique, what would you need for an overnight flight? All in all a quiet and quick flight.

### “the cuisine was varied”
Not Verified | Since our daughter moved to Dubai, we have flown several times with Flydubai. Although the economy has always been pretty good, business is much more so. They constantly had a great assortment of wines and the cuisine was varied and a super vast array of films, TV shows and music. We like this airline.

### “Flydubai you can do better”
What an experience, didn’t even board the flight yet. Upon checkin they cannot add my skywards number giving various excuses. Secondly flight delayed, was standing in the queue for almost 30 mins and then a gentleman announced the flight is delayed, still waiting nobody knows whats happening. Flydubai you can do better, let’s see how the rest of the flight goes.

### “very bad service”
Not Verified | I was with my family travelling from Kabul to Dubai. The experience we received was horrible. The FlyDubai staff in Kabul were not responsive and asked for a bribe. Due to the excess weight, I paid 350 USD for 8 kilograms. The entire team at Kabul airport is inexperienced and uses inappropriate language. We paid 3200 dollars for the flight, unfortunately, I didn't get a cup of water or even food. It will be my last flight with Fly Dubai. I would recommend everyone not to travel with them as they will provide very bad service, which my family and I experienced. Thank you.

### "worst airline I have ever used"
Not Verified |  Absolutely the worst airline I have ever used. They kept changing the flight schedule. I ended up in a 21 hours lay over at Dubai airport. They refused to give me a hotel room and basically said it's not their problem. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

### "incredibly disappointing experience"
I had an incredibly disappointing experience with Flydubai on a flight scheduled for August 17th, which was delayed by 16 hours. The treatment of passengers, especially those with young children like myself, was appalling. Despite unforeseen mechanical issues which can be understood, the handling of the situation was unacceptable. We were not prioritized and ended up waiting until late at night without proper accommodations. No food or water was provided at the hotel, and the communication from Flydubai was almost non-existent. We were left stranded, uninformed, and anxious throughout the ordeal. Additionally, the in-flight experience on the rescheduled flight was just as poor, with inappropriate meals for children and broken equipment. I am shocked at the lack of care and professionalism shown by Flydubai, and I find it necessary to warn others about this level of service. I have reached out to Flydubai for an explanation and compensation for the additional expenses incurred but have yet to receive an adequate response. This was not just a flight delay; it was a complete failure in service on multiple levels. Observation: Despite sending a formal letter of complaint, no compensation has been offered nor has there been any proper acknowledgment from Flydubai. Their disregard for addressing customer grievances is unacceptable.

### "highly disappointing experience"
I recently flew with Flydubai on flight FZ 1786 from Krakow to Dubai on August 19th, 2024, and unfortunately, it was a highly disappointing experience. The flight was delayed by three hours, which caused significant disruptions to my plans upon arrival. To make matters worse, the crew's behavior was unprofessional and frustrating. As a light sleeper, I was trying to rest during the flight, but I was abruptly awakened by a flight attendant who asked me to adjust my seat to accommodate the passenger behind me. This request came after takeoff and after the seatbelt sign had been turned off, making it unnecessary and intrusive, especially since there was an empty seat available in the first row that could have resolved the issue without disturbing me. Overall, the flight was exhausting, and the crew did little to alleviate the discomfort caused by both the delay and their actions. I expected better service and professionalism from Flydubai, and this experience has left me deeply dissatisfied.

### "Pure scam and racket"
We Tried several times to check in online the day before our flight and add bags multiple times through their website. Was told can't check in or alter anything for this flight online and to go to kiosk at airport. No problem. Show up 3 hours early first in line to check in. They tell us we need to pay for our luggage, ok no problem. Our bag weighed 26 kg, was told it would be 16euros per kg for a total of 500+USD to check one bag. Obviously I asked is that a mistake there's no way it cost that much. Was told no that's our policy. SO you prevent the customer from checking in online and adding bags like every other airline on Earth. Then when they arrive at airport you force them to add bags at check in counter and price gouge them. Pure scam and racket. But no worries I'll be doing a charge back on my credit card changing my card number and blocking fly Dubai from charging my card again. Now my bags will fly free, never using this trash airline again. P.s. they also charge you an entertainment package to watch movies or TV on your flight, I've been on almost every airline on the world and have never experienced that. Avoid this airline like the plague.

### "Absolute rubbish racist airline"
Do not use this airline especially if you have kids. They do not accomodate parents with small kids and do not care! Absolute rubbish racist airline. Do not waste your money!

### "Never again!"
The flight left 2hours late - they said it was due to a delay in the flight arriving from Dubai. So I missed my connecting flight to SIN. When we landed at DXB, we had to wait 30min for the stairs to be connected. The ground staff were nonchalantly sitting around, in no hurry to connect the stairs so we could deplane. At the connection desk, they rebooked me on a flight leaving 12h later and told me they’d booked a room for me at the terminal hotel meanwhile. But when I reached the hotel, they had no record of a booking. I’ve been sitting here for 30min waiting for the room. Never again!! One positive note- the flight crew were very nice and helpful which is why I gave them one star

### "no one came to pick us up"
We have booked a transfer through flydubai from the airport to the hotel and vice versa, but no one came to pick us up and we took a taxi. Our money was not refunded and no way to contact them, as the email they provided us is incorrect

### "they aren't helpful at all"
Lost my baggage, it's been days and didn't get it back yet. I emailed, called, tweeted them on X, did everything they asked for and they aren't helpful at all.

### "They took my carry on"
They took my carry on and put it in the luggage. And later I saw bigger the mine. This is really rude. I got a carry on just to save time and reach the embassy.

### “managerial staff are absolutely horrendous”
I paid 150 USD extra to be able to cancel my flight without charges, when I canceled my flight I was told I can only get a voucher. The managerial staff are absolutely horrendous, they are noticeably messy and ungroomed, their attitude can only be justified by ignorance.

### "blatant neglect of FlyDubai"
We unfortunately got caught up in the storm of the century in Dubai. All flights were understandably cancelled. As an airline captain myself, I do understand this kind of issue, and in this instance, it was a huge issue. There was nothing FlyDubai could do about the airport shutdown. They however, failed grossly at the relatively simple task of being compassionate communicative humans. We arrived in DXB at around 14h00 on the 16th and had to mill around in the terminal building with the hundreds (or thousands?) of other passengers, with no information at all and not one FlyDubai staff member available to offer and information. The first FlyDubai staff member we saw was at 2h00 on the 17th. Some bottles of water were offered, but no information was available. This was understandable too, but it is totally unacceptable for no FlyDubai staff to have been present for the first 12 hours of this event, which at this time had deteriorated into an ordeal. I decided to see if I could get on the next flight out and discovered that there were only 2 business class tickets available, but at a cost of USD 6013 for 2. It's a 5 hour trip and the tickets (economy) would usually cost USD 300 for 2. I bought the tickets and moved my wife and I into the business lounge, because at this point, there was a fairly large police presence in the terminal building to stop the isolated scuffles from turning into a full scale riot. I certainly did not want my wife in harm's way. I do understand that there are algorithms that determine ticket prices based on demand, but everyone felt so mistreated by the blatant neglect of FlyDubai to be human, that I felt extorted by the price I had to pay to keep my wife safe and get us out of that hellish experience. I could continue and mention the bad service on the flights, but that is typical FlyDubai and it's what we all expect anyway.

### "far from satisfactory"
My recent experience with Flydubai was far from satisfactory. My travel companion and I were scheduled to depart on Flight FZ1026 on 14 April 2024 at 12:15 pm. However, the flight was delayed and ultimately departed as Flight FZ1028 on 15 April 2024 at 08:15 am, a full 20 hours later. The first issue we encountered was the untimely notification of the delay and subsequent cancellation of our flight. We were only informed of this while in line for check-in, a mere 90 minutes before the original departure time. This lack of communication caused significant inconvenience and frustration, as well as additional expenses due to the need for last-minute adjustments to our travel plans, accommodation and plans. The remedial measures implemented by Flydubai were more detrimental than beneficial. After enduring a four-hour wait in high temperatures, we were directed to a hotel that was far from acceptable. The conditions were unhygienic and unsafe, with stained bed linens and tripping hazards prevalent throughout (out of order elevator). Furthermore, the food and water provided were unsuitable for our dietary requirements and were offered too late to be of any real benefit. The confusion regarding the rescheduled flight were categorically unacceptable. We were initially told that the flight would depart at 10:30 pm, only for this time to be revised on four separate occasions, culminating in a final departure time of 08:15 on 15 April 2024. This lack of clear communication left us in a state of uncertainty and resulted in us being unable to fulfill our work obligations on 15 April 2024. In summary, the service provided by Flydubai on this occasion fell significantly short of the high standards I have come to associate with Emirates and Flydubai. The financial burdens we have been subjected to are directly attributable to the actions of Flydubai’s personnel. I did formally request compensation, this was rejected after multiple back and forth with customer complaints email address.

### "luggage did not arrive in Salzburg"
Not Verified |   The luggage did not arrive in Salzburg. Since flydubai is the only company in Salzburg that covers the costs of delivery to the home address, I would have to drive again from Liezen to Salzburg = 320 km and 4 hours. Das Gepäck kam nicht im Salzburg an. Da flydubai als einzige Gesellschaft on Salzburg die Kosten für die Zustellung an die Wohnadresse übernimmt müsste ich nochmals von Liezen nach Salzburg fahren = 320 km u. 4 Stunden

### "a great flight experience"
Not Verified |   Flydubai offers comfortable, quiet aircraft with a pleasant cabin crew. I really liked flying, even though the trip was short. The layover and connecting flights were easy and I had a great flight experience with flydubai.

### "customer service is the worst"
The level of customer service is the worst I have seen in 30 years of flying. While aircraft issues are understood, it’s the inability to inform passengers of what is going on that shows a level of incompetence. There is absolutely no commitment to showing any level of care to the passengers. A 10 hour delay was not explained at any time and the customer service centre could not provide any useful information. Do not fly with them.

### "never fly again with flydubai"
I will never fly again with flydubai. In both flights the plane was so small meaning no place to sit properly and if you are unlucky and you neighbor is a bit big you will feel oppressed. The seats are so small that on my flight back every one was hitting my shoulders whenever they were passing by including the staff who never said sorry to me. I try to go to the toilet but same issue I think it has been designed for kids .. seriously I'm 1m70 for 70kg and it was impossible to stand without touching both sides of the toilet's wall while flying. On my flight back I wasn't hungry (the food is not good but it's more or less the same for every company) however I asked for the dessert only and the staff told me "dessert is only for people who pay an extra" quite annoying when you pay already 600euros. Staff was smiling only when you enter and exit the plane, rest of the time they make you feel like they don't care at all. You have no idea my reaction when I came to realize that I must pay extra to have access to the i=onboard entertainment. I understand no movies for the short flights but when you have a 7 hours flight ahead it's a real disgrace. Flydubai surprised me a lot by being so unprofessional, and is the most expensive and the worst low-cost flight company that ever existed.

### "had to spend 28 hours at the airport"
We departed from Baku and reached Dubai airport. Due to heavy rains, all flights were cancelled (which we understand as a natural calamity). However, flydubai staff were nowhere to be seen. Not a single staff was available for speaking or seeking advise. Only one staff was there and too rude as if we are disturbing him. However, none of the staff was available during that time and we had to spend 28 hours at the airport with 2 children (7yrs and 2yrs). No hotels provided, no proper guidance provided. A reputation of the company depends on the employees, and to our shock, not even a single staff was available. This shows how much they value their customers, and none of them were there to represent Flydubai and to advise us what needs to be done. Luggage: Luggage were received after 4 days of arrival at the destination Airport. Even the luggags were not proper and many items were broken and mishandled. Our concern is that even though nobody can control rains or any mishaps, during such a time, nobody was there for consultation and had to spend 28 hours at the airport in a single seat with no proper food and water.

### "I felt at ease"
I've taken this flight before, from Tehran to Dubai. As someone who personally fears flying, I felt at ease during these flights. The meals and the few drinks are superb. I really enjoy flying with FlyDubai, excellent entertainment, plenty of options, quickening the passing of time and excellent crew.

### "the most horrendous experience"
Not Verified |   My friend recently had the most horrendous experience trying to fly from Dubai to Italy via a connecting flight with flydubai on April 19th, 23:55. Zero Customer Support: Four hours before his flight, on April 19th, he received an email saying he couldn't board due to transit restrictions at Dubai Airport. No accommodation assistance, no attempt to find alternative routes, nothing. With his flight canceled, he faced a serious accommodation issue. There was a flight on April 21st to Milan, but flydubai's website conveniently lacked any option to book it. To make matters worse, flydubai's offices were closed after 5:30 pm on April 19th and would remain closed for the next two days due to the weekend. Even their helpline was useless, and a trip to the airport yielded no solutions. Costly Consequences: Forced to book with another airline, my friend ended up paying 250 euros more than his original flydubai ticket. So, to anyone considering flydubai, save yourself the headache, the heartache, and the extra cash. Fly with a company that actually cares about its customers and offers real solutions, not just empty promises.

### "worst flight experiences"
I have been travelling since 30 years with many airlines but first time ever, I am experiencing one of the worst flight experiences with flydubai. They didn't offer any complementary drinks instead they were selling. We had to purchase for all entertainment package including movies, earpods and no customer care whatsoever. This airline is only for money, not for customer care. This is my first and last journey with with this airline.

### "Worst airline I ever booked"
Not Verified |  Worst airline I ever booked. Overpriced for what is offered- basically this is “cheap”airline but charging regular airline price. They do not care about customers! Food is terrible. Our flight was cancelled and the airline did not offer any compensation, hotel etc. We filed a complaint but they simply refused to cover our extra night stay that was caused by the cancellation. Will never make the mistake of flying with them again

### "horrible customer service"
Not Verified |  The most horrible customer service, do not care about their clients experience, greedy to make profit only, back and forth emails same response, asking to call or send an email so manager can solve the issue, manager not available. Game in a never-ending circle. First and last time with Flydubai!

### “Very bad experience”
Not Verified |  Very bad experience with flydubai. They made an issue for my laptop bag which was extra than hand luggage and were not letting me board until I paid an extra charge. Every time we carry a laptop bag with us there has never been an issue. The person who was in charge was so rude with me and other customers. In flight we pre ordered my food with my ticket, the cabin crew skipped me in the row while serving food to others, I had to call her and ask for my food which was so unusual. Never had these type of issues.

### "providing very bad service"
Not Verified |  Flydubai is providing very bad service. Seats are really not comfortable - while checkin they have provided us seats at emergency exit window which do not recline on a 6 hours journey was a suffer for us. Seats are very compact and not comfortable. Meal was not that good quality. They charge for every entertainment activity

### "worst Airline I've dealt with"
The worst Airline I've dealt with, stay away. FlyDubai made us miss our flight, put us down for a No show and we were stuck. Further more, they charged us a No show fee because we had to rebook the flights we were already on to get back home. The worst customer service and treatment. We ended up having to buy the tickets that we already had. Disgusting, avoid at all cost.

### "worst flight experience I've ever had"
The worst flight experience I've ever had. The flight had 30 min delay, there was no entertainment and the snack was so terrible. the taxi time was so long on DXB and it took 35 minutes to ride from plane to the terminal on crowded bus, same experience on return flight. They broke my new bag with a big hole on it. I fill claim on airport but get no info from them after 4 days even I called several time to their office. I had to buy new bag and then at last minute, the send me email to come and get new bag and they refuse to pay back the cost instead. I will never try them again

### "The worst flight experience"
The worst flight experience I ever had was with this airline. On January 28, 2024, I took flight number FZ 1929/EK 2490 from Dubai to Tehran. The behavior of the flight attendants was extremely rude and disrespectful. The children's meal served was of very poor quality and inedible. All services, including the use of personal monitors, were paid. Additionally, there was an empty seat due to a medical issue with one of the passengers who requested to be moved to that seat. Despite the seat being vacant and unsold, the flight attendant demanded money in a very impolite manner for the passenger to switch seats! Personally, I would have preferred to travel by bus instead of this airline.

### "flight attendant rudely answered"
Not Verified |  The flight attendant rudely answered the question of whether we could use the toilet, refusing without explanation how long we would have to wait for takeoff and when such an opportunity would arise.

### "If you are late for a check in"
The most horrible unreliable disrespectful company ever. If you are late for a check in just little bit and  there is still 1.5 hour till the departure - they won't let you in and won't refund. If they delay by 1.5h - it's totally fine, no apologies or any compensation. I got a more convenient flight from Male (which of course costed more than a less convenient timing) not to wait for too long. And they delayed and i still had to wait for many hours at the airport!! If they don't like something - they don't let you in, and no refund

### “extremely rude and very unpleasant”
Never again, I had an extremely bad experience with this airline in Dubai terminal 2, my flight was Toronto to Addis Ababa via Dubai. I stayed in Dubai for 6 days and had an extra luggage which I paid 100 cad dollars in Canada for. While I was in Dubai I called Flydubai how much an extra luggage would cost and I was informed that I was allowed two luggage, total of 40 kilos. The day of my flight I was informed at the counter that I had to pay 215 US dollars for the second luggage. I explained to them that I actually paid 100 Canadian dollars for the extra luggage which is roughly 80 US dollars for a 15 hour flight, and made no sense to pay 215 USD for a 5 hour flight, which I was actually informed by them over the phone that it was free. They were extremely rude and very unpleasant to deal with. I had no choice but to pay. My ordeal never stopped here, after passing through security and got to my gate, they started weighing my personal bag, and asked me to pay again for the "extra weight" in my personal bag, as they only allowed 7 kilograms per passenger and my personal bag was slightly overweight, it was about 8.4 kilograms. Please be careful with this airline, as for me or my family or friends, never again.

### "gone done from bad to pathetic now"
The airline service has gone done from bad to pathetic now. The condition of aircraft, the crew response and the service is pathetic now. Will never recommend to anyone even if they starts giving tickets for free. Its shame to say flydubai is part of Emirates group.

### "hands down the worse flight ever"
The worst airline ever. I have a round trip from Bahrain to Dubai and back, the flight was late on both trips. The luggage system is very bad and the cabin crew failed to assist me with the bags. I asked 3 times for a cup of tea. The first was before the flight even took off, the cabin crew told me on the final request that "we will land soon. I will give you once we land". I told him not to bother because I can get it from any coffeeshop in the airport. It's hands down the worse flight ever.

### “Worst airline I have ever flown”
Worst airline I have ever flown. If I pay for flydubai why I am getting a SmartWings plane. Seats are broken and no leg space. Complete disaster. Never ever use flydubai. They took an extra 200aed luggage fee from me for duty free items also.

### "low-cost and low-dignity flight"
Not Verified |  I bought a flight to Sri Lanka on Emirates website and I was given a "flydubai" seat between Dubai and Colombo. That was my first experience with flydubai, and hopefully, the last. The first curious detail was that on my way to the seat, the no-smiling air hostess demanded to see my boarding card. I showed it. Then she told me that my 22 seat was right after the 21 seat. That was the last "help" I got from her the wholn e flight. The economy seat is crammed, and they do their best so that you don't move during the flight, a very "thrombosis-friendly" policy. There are no amenities - not even a small pillow or drinking water. All the time you are remembered to stay seated with your seat belt on and that the toilets are closed. One third of the seats were empty, but the unmerciful air hostesses made sure I was not allowed to jump to another more comfortable seat. Rules, punishment, rules. That is all you get from the hostesses, no amenities and no smiles. I am so disappointed with Emirates for selling this terrible experience in their website. I was not looking for a low-cost and low-dignity flight and I paid the full Emirates price.

### "disappointed in FlyDubai"
Not Verified |  I am disappointed in Flydubai. Passengers travelling to Oman to get their visas extended aren't given any check-in information. They are expected to just figure it out. The check-in screens for these flights are blank. At the very least, the airline can display the check-in area or inform passengers to self check-in. The ground staff aren't helpful either. They are rude and arrogant.

### "It was a terrible experience"
It was a terrible experience, there was a little girl in our fight and at the middle of the flight she felt sick. She was shaking and her parents got worried about her condition, so they asked for some help. Unfortunately, the flight attendant didn't take any steps to offer any kind of help. All they did was to nod their head and when the mother asked for a blanket to help her keep the child warm, they declared that there isn't any. The parents asked for help from other passengers, a lady gave them her scarf and I gave them my jacket. On the way out, we saw blankets laying on the seats while they could have given it to the child and refused to do so. When we got to the baggage claim section at the airport, half of the passengers didn't receive their bags while we figured the baggage hadn't been sent with the flight. That is pure irresponsibility, waste of passengers' time and being unprofessional towards passengers. I would never recommend this airline to anyone.

### "a terrible experience"
Not Verified |  It was a terrible experience, there was a little girl in our fight and at the middle of the flight she felt sick. She was shaking and her parents got worried about her condition, so they asked for some help. Unfortunately, the flight attendant didn't take any steps to offer any kind of help. All they did was to nod their head and when the mother asked for a blanket to help her keep the child warm, they declared that there isn't any. The parents asked for help from other passengers, a lady gave them her scarf and I gave them my jacket. On the way out, we saw blankets laying on the seats while they could have given it to the child and refused to do so! When we got to the baggage claim section at the airport, half of the passengers didn't receive their bags while we figured the baggage hadn't been sent with the flight! If we wanted to get our baggage some other time, we would have sent them separately! That is pure irresponsibility, waste of passengers time and being unprofessional towards passengers. I would never recommend this flight company to anyone.

### "absolute worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  This was the absolute worst airline ever, the seats hurt your back, they are too hard and straight up that you can't even get a little bit comfortable. The food is not even edible. A nightmare overall.

### "didn't let me board the flight"
Not Verified |  Worst airline that I ever seen. Customer service is very disappointing. When I’m departing flydubai ground staff didn't let me board the flight on time, asking about my visa matters and they want to delay me. Bureau also gave permission for me to fly on that day since it was my first travel to Dubai.

### "assisted me beyond expectations"
I have to thank 2 wonderful guys who assisted me beyond expectations in June 2023. Boarding was called and then unfortunately it was noticed that a digit typo on my visa to Baku was incorrect. Senior Supervisor Mohammed could see I was shocked and panicking. Mohammed was determined to get me on my flight. He and Hany went over and beyond to help with fast track visa. I didn't manage to board my initial flight but actually flew on the next flight a few hours later. My holiday was only interrupted for a few hours. I cannot thank Mohammed enough for everything he did for me that morning Absolutely star first class customer service.

### "one of the worst experiences"
Flight was scheduled 16:25 local time of Tbilisi but it didn’t take off before 17:15. That’s not the problem, after taking off by almost 20 minutes the pilot announces that we have to go back to Tbilisi as there’s a minor technical issue so we landed in Tbilisi airport again and it wasn’t explained what’s the reason. After landing the pilot announced that there was a door which wasn’t closed properly and pressure wasn’t the normal pressure. And it would just take 25 to 30 minutes to make the required maintenance and we can fly back to destination. Now it’s 20:00 and still waiting. The plane is full and air conditioning isn’t working well making temperature increase inside the plane. It is one of the worst experiences I had in flights, being trapped inside the plane and not knowing what’s going. The pilot just announced at 20:05 that we should fly in 10 minutes, hopefully it would happen this time. Anyway, that was my first round trip experience with flydubai and definitely will be the last.

### "A horrible experience"
A horrible experience! More than one hour delay, almost no air condition when we enter airplane and very weak during the trip! I am sorry to use Flydubai and will do my best to avoid this horrible airline in the future

### "Ryanair of the Middle-east"
It's a low-cost airline based in Dubai so I wasn't expecting a full range service. On-time boarding. Bus transfer to the plane. It seems like they have zero tolerance for tardiness. At 5:30, bus doors were closed and headed straight to the plane for the 5:50 flight. Within 20 minutes, everyone was boarded and seated and plane started taxing. 10/10 for the time efficiency. Clean plane and efficient. There wasn't much of a service and most of the flight time, I slept. Landed on time. I would say FlyDubai is a Ryanair of the Middle-east though ticket prices aren't that cheap.

### "I hope FlyDubai will improve communication"
I booked Bahrain to Dubai on 25th August departure 15.35. On arrival at airport, flight was delayed, did not get any information regarding the delay until i arrived at the departure gate. FlyDubai could have send me a message or text about the delay, I could have stayed with my family. I hope FlyDubai will improve communication with Passengers

### "tedious and unpleasant experience"
Not Verified |  We flew business class and I can honestly say it was the worst business class experience ever. The actual flying experience was okay, flight crew were good and the food was decent enough and for a 5 hour flight the seats were fine. Transition through Dubai was horrendous. Transferring from T2 to T3 was a tedious and unpleasant experience. At times it felt like we were catching the last plane out of a war zone. Long walks, long crowded bus journeys and back again to the plane. Won’t be using them again.

### "never use this airline again"
Not Verified |  Old plane, poor service, barely any announcements. No in flight entertainment, this was a 5 hour flight. Flydubai operate flights on behalf of Emirates, there is poor communication between these airlines, I don’t understand how Emirates can associate themselves with such a low standard. At the gate at Zanzibar airport our flydubai flight was cancelled due to technical issues. We were at the airport for 5 hours until we were bused to a hotel for an overnight stay, awaiting information. During our time at the airport we were not given any water, little information and minimal understanding for our predicament. It was chaotic, the airline staff were verging on rude. We felt treated like cattle, and that we were the problem. When they did have information, that we were being sent to a hotel as the new flight would be some time away, the staff at the desk relayed this in a disorderly way, they had access to loud speakers but didn’t use them, therefore important messages were not reaching people. One of the passengers was helping organise a flydubai desk clerk as he didn’t have a clue and couldn’t cope with the pressure. The flight was rescheduled for 26 hours later. Many of the passengers missed their connecting flights including us. On arrival at Dubai airport we were instructed to go to the Emirates desk to collect boarding passes for our rescheduled flights and to collect hotel vouchers, as the new flights were the next day. At the Emirates desk all the passengers on the cancelled Zanzibar flight were told by Emirates staff that we had all been booked into the Dubai airport Holiday Inn Express. We were told to meet a shuttle bus which would take us there. On arrival at the holiday inn express we were informed that they knew nothing of this booking. They called FlyDubai who also said they knew nothing. The hotel bused everyone back to Dubai airport, this is approx 60 people, including families with young children, elderly relatives, all travel weary, confused and fed up. And we were advised to go to the emirates desk again. The staff on the emirates desk said that it wasn’t really their problem as it was a flydubai flight cancellation. They would send a flydubai representative to come and speak to us. The emirates hotel booking staff gave the impression they didn’t need to help us and were doing us a favour by making calls, but it wasn’t really their problem. We were being passed around, no one was able to give answers. When a flydubai representative finally came to see us he didn’t really know what was going on. Said they had made a mistake and that a new bus would come to take us to Aloft, he said it would be 20 minutes. An hour later, still no bus. I asked at the emirates desk if they knew anything, they said it would be 10 minutes. The bus didn’t come. Another flydubai rep came down and advised his colleague we were at the wrong place. So we had to walk back to the original bus stop to be transported to the Aloft hotel. We landed in Dubai at 3pm and didn’t get to Aloft till 10pm. This was another 7 hours of additional faff time for 60 people who had already experienced a cancelled flight, poor service and under the circumstances were being incredibly patient about the situation. 45 hours later than planned we are back home. We will never use this airline again.

### "let down and dissatisfied"
Not Verified |  Upon arriving at the airport, I expected a seamless and premium boarding experience, given the premium price I paid for a business class ticket. However, I was met with significant delays during the boarding process, causing unnecessary inconvenience and anxiety for me and my fellow passengers. To make matters worse, despite the considerable delay, the flydubai did not offer any form of compensation or gesture to alleviate the inconvenience caused by the boarding delays. This lack of acknowledgment of the inconvenience experienced by business class passengers is disheartening, as it implies a disregard for the value of our patronage. As a loyal customer, I believe it is crucial to bring this matter to your attention. I have always held the airline’s services in high regard, but this recent experience has left me feeling let down and dissatisfied.

### "crew very friendly and attentive"
I flew for a short break DXB-EVN. Outbound was with an older aircraft and the old configuration of business class of 2-2 seats were not fully reclining into flat beds however was spacious and comfortable, crew were very friendly and attentive they came with welcome drinks and hot towels and the meal was delicious inflight entertainment was alright and the inbound was with a brand new aircraft with lie flat beds again a wonderful experience with extra privacy in seats on the 2nd row as it comes with 1-1 configuration all in all was a very nice experience.

### "the most negative attitude person"
At the boarding gate I was lucky to face the most negative attitude person in the world and when I tried to complain I found out her manager was even worse than her. He did not look whilst taking a personal phone calls while I am talking to him. I ended up asking him his name and with total ignorance he left me with out telling me his name, saying you're not authorised to answer.

### "worst experience we had with FlyDubai"
The worst experience we had with FlyDubai, flight was delayed for 3hours, and because of that we missed our connecting flight from Dubai to Doha. They arranged next flight after 8hours, they don’t even provide hotel accommodation even after asking them. They asked passengers to sit on chair for 8hours. Even the help desk persons, they were very rude with passengers.

### "low quality for meal"
Not Verified | Very bad services / very expensive / our baggage arrived with big delay / very very cheap meal / no responsibility / no passenger pack / low quality for meal

### "Terrible airline"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline. The cabin crew had everybody sit tight for an hour without AC on waiting for clearance. The temperature in Dubai is 45 degrees celsius and people were barely able to breathe. The cabin crew were rude when asked about any information. The flight was already late for take off and add to it everyone melting of the extreme heat sitting in a small closed cabin without AC without any clarification on expectations as to when we would be moving or getting the AC on.

### "rude and unprofessional"
The worst experience I ever had in an airline. First of all the flight attendants were rude and unprofessional. The other things to be mentioned are, 1. My American Tourister check in bag was dented in two corners and the wheel got broken. The handling of the luggage is so bad that I am still counting the number of scratches number of scratches. And remember, this substandard service is after paying for each kg of baggage. 2. While serving food and beverages they forgot it is an international flight. 200 grams of pasta for the 6 hours journey from Dubai to Zagreb. Forget about complimentary alcohol, they don't even serve enough water. Only once they served 100ml water and when asked for additional pack they said free water is over in the flight. Are you running a local taxi service! 3. No complimentary movie, documentary on board. Only Quran is free to read. Keep your religious beliefs at home and learn to serve passengers. And no complimentary headphones, which I got in almost all international airlines I travelled earlier. 4. I forgive them for this understanding their poor financial condition.

### "anything that can go wrong will go wrong"
While travelling with Flydubai anything that can go wrong will go wrong. I have booked with my family a tour from 15 to 23 June this year on Maldives, flight from Minsk to Male (connection in Dubai). The flight from Minsk to Dubai was delayed repeatedly, we stayed at the airport for a whole night, and then it was cancelled. We have spent a day in a hotel near airport. Next flight has been scheduled for the next night but it was delayed for an hour. Because of this, we did not get to the connection flight (when we passed the passport control it was already last call). Our flight was rebooked for the next night, we spent another day in a hotel in Dubai. My son felt bad after two sleepless night and me with my wife felt exhausted. The last flight (Dubai – Male) was also delayed but it is not the worst. They lost our baggage. Btw, before that flight I have asked if the baggage is on the same plane and the staff representative confirmed. Therefore, we have lost almost 3 days of holidays and Flydubai refused to compensate neither lost days at the resort nor compensation of moral harm. I assume based on the feedback and the comments it is a common practice for Flydubai to act like that. Never recommend this company to anyone.

### "vacations were ruined because of Fly Dubai"
Not Verified |  Our beautiful vacations were ruined because of Fly Dubai! We have booked a flight to Ljubljana with one stop at Dubai. When the time came for us to finish our vacation at Zanzibar, the flight was postponed I don't know how many times and after the entire day at the terminal they told us that the flight is canceled due to technical problems of the plane and then the entire FlyDubai representatives at the airport have gone and nobody told us anything. We were left completely alone without food and water which they are obligated to provide in this cases. When we were very very angry, and finaly able to find someone from FlyDubai, they arranged a hotel where we arrived at 4.30 in the morning. I will not even mention that the hotel didn't have enough rooms and many of us had to go to other hotels and went to sleep even later. In the morning, they told us that they will pick us up at 11am, since they arranged a flight for us that will leave at 2.20pm. We were there at the terminal again, and of course there was no flight at 2.20 as promised. Meanwhile, we received numerous untrue information from the representatives (for example, they told us that we will go to Zagreb next day, then after 10 min they told us that we go to Ljubljana after 3 days, and then after 15min they told us that all plains are full and that we have to wait, and so on), it was an absurd, we got really afraid that we will never leave Zanzibar. Then, the plane finally arrived and we came to the hotel in Dubai at 1.30am next day (because we ofcourse missed our connecting flight to Ljubljana). We slept for 2,5 hours and then we went from Dubai to Vienna, which is 5 hours bus drive to Ljubljana. Many of us had problems because we missed the entire day at work, many of us got sick because we were so tired and nervous, and some passengers also did not have enough medicines with them, it was a nightmare!!! So, we left on Saturday afternoon and came home on Monday evening, in those 2 days we slept only for a few hours, it was an agony and now they don't even want to give us a refund which are obligated to give, their excuses are a true disaster. Don't travel with them if you want to come home.

### "doesn't care about the passengers"
Not Verified |  The flight was canceled from Moscow to Dubai due to technical reasons and postponed to be at 4:30 am and I had a horrible situation with the hotel stating that they need the immigration paper to book me a room in the hotel. After 7 hours from searching they gave the paper and no time for me to rest because of the boarding time opened. The departure time was delayed for another hour. We reached to Dubai but unfortunately they didn't provide the buses until 45 minutes to reach us. It’s disappointing to have such a bad airline from my own country carrying the name of Dubai with this awful procedures and inconvenient policies that doesn't care about the passengers. This is my last time to fly from this airline and i will never ever recommend anyone to fly on flydubai to anywhere.

### "Extremely horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Extremely horrible experience. Flight delayed for around 3 hours without updating us on what is the issue, constantly saying the flight will be delayed half an hour without any explanation. It is extremely hot, they should at least offer complimentary drinks or let us get out of the flight for a bit. Never flying here again

### "never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  I will never fly this airline again. I fly a lot and every time I fly FlyDubai, it is late. Every single time, there is a weak excuse. This time, more fuel would be needed. So we sat in the plane melting for an extra hour while paperwork was sorted out. I am over this airline.

### "cabin was 16 degrees Celsius"
The temperature in the passenger cabin was 16 degrees Celsius from the beginning. We were struggling to resist like in a fridge. After takeoff, I asked two stewards to do something. Many passengers search for extra clothes, hats, and hooded sweaters. After a while, the temperature increased to 18 degrees C, but after two hours of flight, my portable thermometer indicated 16 degrees Celsius again. I asked a steward again to do something; our kids were sneezing and coughing. Nothing happened this time. I asked for a hot tea, and I received it after 25 minutes. After 4 hours and 40 minutes, we arrived at our destination chilled and shivering from the cold. If you are asking about the rest: garbage food, anytime delays at takeoff, no priority boarding if you travel with children. I see no good future for this flight company if they continue like that.

### "sub par nature of flydubai"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline. On the first leg of the flight there was a delay because of the plane’s a/c. A bunch of passengers were stood on the bus that was supposed to take us to the plane for an hour, no staff explained what was going on until some of the passengers started banging on the bus windows and at one point tripped the emergency exit to attract attention. Second leg of the flight, boarding was delayed by at least 30mins, again no communication or announcements, bunch of passengers lining up waiting to get on. The staff and the flight itself were nice but that was it. Shame because Emirates handled the first part of the trip before layover (HK to Dubai) and they were lovely in contrast as always. Just highlighted the sub par nature of flydubai even further

### "Would not recommend to anyone"
Was allowed time off from my military duty for a 4 day pass. Booked flight, paid for, and plans changed due to unforeseen reasons. I had to cancel my flight. I'm not from over here and never plan to come back so when I canceled my flight I requested a cash refund. They will only give flight vouchers. Does nothing for me so essentially I'm out that money and they win due to their policies and refusal to take care of their customers. Would not recommend to anyone and especially no one for leisure travel while serving overseas in the military.

### "the worst airline ever"
Worst traveling experience. I have traveled with many airlines and they never weigh the laptop but they did that, and asked me to pay half of the ticket price because i had to submit my carry on bag as well and they charged me for the total weight of my carryon bag instead of extra kilos. They are the worst airline ever and their representatives are even worst they don’t tend to help to instead they insist on paying the loot money to the airline.

### "gave a good experience"
Flydubai gave a good experience, the flight staff were professional and attentive. They made us feel welcome and it wasn't a problem to ask for drinks. The food was good and seating was comfortable.

### "low cost quality service"
Not Verified | I traveled for the second time with flydubai and for the second time the plane took off an hour and a quarter late. Due to delay I almost missed my connecting fly for Bangkok in Dubai. My luggage was sent to me the next day late at night. Onboard it was unbearably hot probably due to the air conditioning not being pushed to the maximum to save money. The seats were small, that is ok for a two hour trip but not for a 6 hour trip. I strongly advise to chose this low cost company which only has a low cost quality service but not the price. I find it shameful that all the negative comments are useless to improve The quality of this airline .Apparently flydubai management do not care about customers satisfaction because nothing is done to improve service. Flydubai is absolutely to avoid if you have the choice to travel with another company.

### "nothing commendable with basic food"
Flying second time, long waiting in check in with just one counter for business and one for economy classes. Passengers exhausted and it took more than an hr. Service ok, nothing commendable with basic food. Nothing good compared to the fares they charge.

### "no one understood my request"
Going to the plane, I was told that the flight was full and there was enough luggage in the plane. Trying to get on the plane, I was told that they will take my luggage because it's too big which wasn't the case. I was forced to wait for the luggage (a small bag), no one understood my request and in fact the male stewards on shift ignored me. When I got onboard the plane, the space was more than enough. I was really unhappy and my airport experience was ruined.

### "last time I fly with this disgusting company"
It was the first and last time I fly with this disgusting company. The seats were completely uncomfortable and there was not enough space for legs. The tablet was only working with limited functions. If you want to see a movie or to listen to music you would had to pay extra. There was nothing included in the price of the ticket, I asked for 1 glass of still water and they told me they did not have it and asked me to pay extra. The staff was unprofessional and ineffective. There was a small delay about 15-20 minutes but this was the most insignificant issue. The crew did not apologize for the delay. Very expensive for this poor quality

### flydubai customer review
Booked multi stop flights through an online search engine. Small notification stated that KTM -DXB operated by Fly Dubai. Late take off which is normal from Kathmandu. Service started and noticed the trolley was moving rather quickly through the cabin. Then I realised they were charging people for food and drink. No inflight entertainment either and seats were uncomfortable. Online check in was hopeless, no option to select a seat on 1 leg of return journey or to select veg meal. Emirates are a decent airline but low cost carriers shouldn't operate these flights if they can't provide at least a drink of water and a snack.

### "absolute disrespect"
I came to airport on April 8th and been told that my seat was taken by someone with flexible date of the flight and early check in. I've been promised to get refund back to my card in next 48 hours. I clarified few times. Its money on the card, not voucher? I've been told yes, money on the card. They were asking my payment method. To assure me I'll get my money back for issues policy of company caused me. After 48 hours ! I texted to letstalk flydubai and later on connected to client hot call. I've been told by policy of the company I will get my refund only like voucher. And if I will continue this topic, all my messages will be considered as review. Its absolute disrespect.

### "flydubai does not offer anything"
Zero flight service. Cabin crews did not show up at all from the beginning of takeoff until landing. Some budget airlines provide at least a bottle of water despite their position as a budget airline, flydubai does not offer anything. Seating comfort is acceptable; notwithstanding, there is no TV screen for entertainment. Also, I'm not sure if cabin crews are happy with their work because I don't see any smile from them at all.

### "really uncomfortable"
Not Verified | I have never experienced a such bad company for an airline. Such a low cost company should cover long routes. It was really uncomfortable! I had flight from Dubai to Naples for six hours on a small seat. The plane took off almost one hour late. Everything on-board was on coast (drinks, entertainment system, that is ridiculous!) The crew seemed to be under trained to deal with passengers and not patient at all. I won't dare had any problem on-board. I will never fly again with flydubai or Emirates. Be careful when you buy your tickets with Emirates. Half of the route could be on nice plane with a decent service and half route with flydubai. I have to come back to Bangkok and I'm really afraid to fly again with flydubai. Please improve your service! Don't just try to make big profits. Bad experience means a loss of customers.

### "Extremely small and hard seats"
Not Verified |  I've never experienced such a budget flight internationally. It's like flying Ryanair. Extremely small and hard seats. No drinks on a 16h trip except 2 times a 100 ml water cup. No entertainment, no screens in the seats.

### "Very poor and cheap"
Flight was overbooked, had to wait to find out if i can fly or not. Inflight entertainment is 11 USD. Delayed and not impressed at all with them. Very poor and cheap.

### "not care about customer service"
Not Verified |  I suggest not using Flydubai under any circumstances, the flying route from our destination to Dubai was canceled in their program, and we were promised a refund; we have now been pledged eight weeks by the customer service department that we would handle it escalate and get back to you -however, all empty promises. Flydubai does not care about customer service or is interested in keeping the promises they continuously commit to arranging.

### "We will never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  We will never fly with them again. The plane on the Belgrade-Dubai route was delayed by 6 hours. We missed our scheduled flight to Phuket. Equally bad was our experience with Emirates, which took an unreasonably long time to organize the continuation of our journey. So our journey lasted instead of 15 hours, with a 4-hour break, a total 48 hours, during we suffered material damage that this company did not want to compensate us for. ​​​​​​​​​​

### "never travel by this airline again"
For the first time they checked our bags weight on the last gate to the bus, then to the airplane we purchased some stuff in the airport so weight is more for the bags. The staff is shouting on the people and on us asking to decrease the package and return what we buy. Very silly and stupid people and rude, really we are disappointed today will never travel by this airline again.

### "few staff are smiling"
Flydubai used to be always the best option for me and my wife among the budget airlines. Where we use to get a convenient and quick service but now felt like it has been downgraded. As a budget airlines we don’t expect to get a premium service but always expecting to get at least a friendly and a professional behavior from staff but now that's also has been dropped massively. Only few staff are smiling and willing to help, and thanks for those staff who are willing to help and support.

### "unprofessional staff was rude"
I travelled with my wife and kid. Connecting flight was cancelled. They accommodated us in next flight after 18 hrs. So Our total layover in Dubai was increased to around 23hrs from 5hrs. Surprisingly they refused to give any lounge or stay arrangements. Their unprofessional staff was rude and they just denied everything by saying "you agreed to terms and conditions while booking". They just want money without giving any services.

### "tv screen not working"
6:10 minutes long flight, they did not provide pillow and blanket, even tv screen not working. No seat comfort. Long time waiting in bus

### "the rudest cabin staff ever"
Not Verified |  Totally useless airline by all means, ground staff are so unreasonable and never helpful, onboard the aircraft I faced the rudest cabin staff ever. Seat was so uncomfortable, to pass time I bought a headset to watch TV or music, I got the headset one and a half hours after I asked for it. On top of this when I asked why the cabin crew answered in a very rude way, I was astonished how an airline would hire this kind of ill-mannered person.

### "not value for money"
I have taken different budget airlines throughout my whole life and I do understand that the budget airlines have to cut cost in some parts in order to offer passengers a low airfare, so I'm not expecting high quality service like the 5 star airlines such as Cathay Pacific Airways or Qatar Airways; however, I have never had such a deficient experience until I took Flydubai. I took Flydubai (legally Dubai Aviation Corporation) in February from Dubai to Bahrain. It was merely an hour flight in duration. To start off, the seating comfort in the economy level is probably among one of worst across the budget airlines. Seats can be torturing to the passengers because they are rather flimsy with minimal back and thigh support, but seats can be tilted backward to give you extra comfort, fortunately it was just an hour flight so it was short enough to allow me to stand up and leave the aircraft. Each seat has an touchscreen infotainment display and it offers an array of movies and flight information. This is definitely a bonus for budget airlines; however, I still give 2 stars out of 5 stars in inflight entertainment because the passenger next to me was not able to interact with the infotainment display because there was a touchscreen failure. There is no buttons or remote to control the display so it was a definitely a bummer for the passenger next to me. In addition to that, there is no service whatsoever for the economy class. Despite it was merely just an-hour flight, the flight attendants could hand out water to the passengers at least; however, we have received zero beverage from the airline, which is quite unacceptable. They airfare should not only just cover the journey and infotainment, but also basic beverages like water too! I am not expecting the airline offers soda drinks or meals/snacks, but they should offer at least a bottle of water to each passenger. The ride is generally smooth thanks to the comfort brought by the aircraft Boeing 737-800. The flight took off and landed on off, which definitely scores 5 out of 5. Last but not least, for USD$250 roundtrip, this airline is definitely not value for money considering there is no service at all on a 1-hour flight. I highly do not recommend flying with Flydubai to any passengers due to their little to zero cabin staff service and no offerings of basic beverages.

### "seats were so uncomfortable"
The highlight of this flight was the  Cabin Crew: kind, friendly, available to assist us (Amine and Vladimir are 5 stars). The breakfast served was ok. But the seats were so uncomfortable. The seats are so tight that the screen is right in your face (and if the person in front of you decides to recline its seat you will be inside the screen). After 2h I couldn't find a comfortable position to be seated, my back and my neck hurt. Definitely, an experience not to repeat.

### "staff were very cooperative and friendly"
The check-in process was easy. There was a slight delay of about 15 mins but it was no problem. Despite the limited room between seat rows it was still decently comfortable. The staff were very cooperative and friendly. The luggage arrived in good condition.

### "Worst flying experience"
No variety for food and beverages;  Poorly organized. The hand luggage is way smaller than în any other company and basically forces you not to take one. Worst flying experience of my life.

### "I froze from the cold"
In one week, I had four flights with Fly Dubai. Bucharest-Male (Velana Airport-Maldives) and return. In every flight I froze from the cold. The ventilation was very strong and all the passengers asked the flight attendants to reduce the ventilation or make it warmer. Unfortunately, they did absolutely nothing, and we stayed with jackets and hats on our heads. The food is of poor quality. The coffee..better not serve it anymore.. In conclusion, quality-price, 4.

### "worst airline I've ever flown"
The worst airline I've ever flown. 7-hour flight, all paid movies, headphones for monitors, paid water, service not nice, 7 hours of sauna on the plane, non-working air conditioning, I do not recommend. I would like to add that the flight was bought with emirates and I had the worst flight.

### "highly unethical"
Fly Dubai asks customers to opt to pay a premium to ensure a flexible ticket, which can be amended without incurring a penalty fee. However, what they do not tell you, is that there will always be a 'fare difference' to pay. This is because their 'change my booking' system is run from a separate, more expensive platform than the regular flight booking platform, ensuring the amended flight is more expensive than the original. It's basically a stealth penalty which is not in their T&Cs and highly unethical. I would urge all flight search engines to add a warning to customers regarding this fact.

### "Worst airline experience"
Worst airline experience. I decided to go with my wife to Maldives for our honeymoon. I chose flydubai to get from Warsaw to Male. The ticket was around 20-30% more expensive than from cheaper airlines. I decided to pay more because there was short stopover (3-4 hours) on connecting airport (Dubai). After paying for the flight and getting booking confirmation from flydubai I booked hotels in Maldives. Few days before the flight I received e-mail from flydubai that the time of my flight from Dubai to Male has changed because of operational reasons and now there is only 15 minutes of stopover in Dubai. Shortly after the whole flight was cancelled and I was given a choice to either switch to another flight (for free) or get the voucher to use in the future (no option to get your money back even if flydubai cancels the flight for their own operational reasons!). Since I already booked and paid for hotels in Maldives in time corresponding with my flight that was cancelled I had to choose another flight with the same date of arrival with 11 hours of stopover in Dubai. Few days later I get another e-mail from flydubai informing me that the time of flight has changed again and now I have 12.5 hours of stopover in Dubai. Luckily (it seemed) now because the time of departure was changed again it was possible to get back to the flight almost identical to the flight I originally bought. I wrote e-mail to flydubai kindly asking to rebook me to my original flight without additional payment describing what happened. They denied saying that I already switched to another flight so if I want to change that again I have to pay. I wrote again kindly asking to reconsider since the whole situation was caused by flydubai (operational reasons). They denied again. Best part of their reply was saying that my e-mail will be forwarded to the management to improve my future experience with flydubai and they will do everything to continue to exceed passengers' expectations. I asked them to forward my e-mail to the management to improve my present experience. The replied that any further correspondence from my side will be treated only as feedback. On top of that my flight from Dubai to Male was delayed so I missed the speedboat from Male to the island where I booked the hotel and I had to pay for a night in hotel in Male and go to my destination on the next day. Also, even though there were many empty seats is the plane my wife was seated many rows behind me so I had to ask another passenger to switch with me. Returning flight from Dubai to Warsaw was also delayed. This time I was seated next to my wife but in the last row so we had to put our hand baggage in front of us. The only good thing about this whole situation is that I had plenty of time in Dubai (12.5 hours) to write this review of my experience with flydubai. I'm giving more than 1 star only because the stewards on board of the plane were nice and the meal served on the plane was decent. However it is very unlikely I will ever use flydubai again.

### "It is worst experience with this airline"
Not Verified |  Last year I had a pathetic experience with Flydubai, they cancelled the flight at the very last moment without any reason. I was travelling to Dubai from CCU. It got cancelled & no refund, only voucher & we have to book Emirates with a much higher price. This business model must change. This time it got delayed on both journeys for 1-2 hours without any proper clarifications. Upon asked, they will provide standard answer of technical issues, blah blah. It is worst experience with this airline.

### "I had a horrible experience"
I had a horrible experience with the customer service of fly Dubai. I had an emergency surgery a few days before my flight and in their policy, they are able to change the flight if this occurs. I provided all my discharge forms and a detailed report, requesting a flight for a few days later as I medically couldn't sit on a plane so soon after the surgery. The customer service team was completely incompetent and kept bouncing me from phone to email. The representative that I spoke to for rebooking over email was extremely rude and unprofessional. There was no sense of compassion or understanding. They kept requesting a doctor's note in addition to the discharge forms. I managed to provide this with a registered doctor that was in charge of my follow up appointments. But the representative then said that the note had to be from the surgeon himself which is a near impossible ask. This was on a Saturday evening with my flight being the next day. When I explained that this couldn't be done on such short notice with my flight the next day, they sent me an automated email saying I would no longer be allowed to contact the team and that anything else I said would be considered 'feedback'. Very in-compassionate. I had to then pay the same price as my original ticket just to change the date by a few days. On top of that, the flight was delayed by an hour with no updates on the check in screen or from staff. The check in line at the airport was miles long and it took us close to 1 hours and 45 mins to reach the desk. I will never be using this airline again.

### "it was the worst experience"
Not Verified |  This is the worst trip by far. Trip delayed for two hours for unknown reasons and the captain miscommunicated the duration of the flight that took 4 hours and a half instead of the usual 3 hours and a half. Chairs are broken and filthy and very small. Apart from a friendly attendants, it was the worst experience for me and my family and never again.

### "Very poor airline"
The service provided was good but the quantity of food provided is not enough. Also the seat was not good. The baggage which was supposed to be received on the same day was not received until the other day. Very poor airline with zero facility.

### "The worst airline ever"
The worst airline ever, I had terrible experience with this airline. Their customer service is nonexistent and very rude group of people i ever dealt with. I will never fly with them again.

### "offered an awful service"
We booked return tickets from Dubai to Doha for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, what they called "Match day Tickets". From check in all the way to the actual flight the experience was terrible. Flying Dubai to Doha the Check In we did online went successful in the website but was not recognised as valid when we turned up to the airport. Staff told us they don't know why this happened and made us check in again, there was a massive line we purposely wanted to avoid by doing online check in. Anyway after doing the line and check in we finally get to the gate and surprise surprise due a mistake they allocated our seats to someone else therefore they asked us to wait for the next flight as the one we booked was full. Waited until next flight which obviously delayed our arrival to Qatar by almost 2 hours and messed up our itinerary. Flying Doha to Dubai we enjoyed the football games and almost forgot the awful initial experience, but little did we know Flydubai could top that bad time for our departure flight. We looked at our booking document (issued by flydubai) which stated the flight in Doha would depart from DOH airport, so we head to that airport and staff told us no flydubai flights were departing from there. They were actually departing from DIA. So we rushed to the other airport and arrived 30 min before boarding. We get to the front desk and the Flydubai staff tells us the flight is closed and now we need to buy another ticket (3x the original price) to return to Dubai. After a long discussion, there was no other option than buying the other ticket, but staff told us to not worry as we would get a refund as the booking document they issue stated the wrong airport. As expected after contacting flydubai about this issue, they denied any responsibility and when they ran out of arguments closed the case saying: "Any communication on the same subject will be considered as feedback only. In short, Flydubai impacted our trip itinerary, offered an awful service and stole our money through a scam of producing erroneous info so you miss the flight and they charge you 3x times the price for a new one. Never again.

### "airport staff were friendly"
Not Verified | Will fly again. The flight was on time and the airport staff were friendly. In-flight food and services was good. Since I'm short, leg space didn't matter much, but even a taller person would have found it comfortable. I'd travel with Flydubai again if I am visiting Dubai again.

### "Not business class as we know it"
Not business class as we know it. I flew both directions to Italy from Dubai in Business. This is a poor experience relative to other Business class services. Seats are limited in recline- and safety belts are hugely uncomfortable. Food is economy+ and beverage selection is non existence - one red - one white wine. Crew unable to make a standard cocktail - which is easily done in Emirates economy. Only 3 rows for business so service was fine if sporadic. However, the destruction of my baggage was an unpleasant experience with my case forced opened and all lock mechanisms broken. Making the bag worthless. The complete denial of all responsibility puts in stark evidence the "Fly Dubai Customer Focus". Best advice avoid business class and take one of the most uncomfortable economy seats of any airline and don't what ever you do check in a bag .

### "notorious for delays"
Booked a flight to Osaka with Emirates with transit through Dubai. The only thing I hate about Emirates is those codeshare agreements with Flydubai who are notorious for delays (based on past experience). However, this one took me by surprise and the plane we got on was actually well air conditioned, had a swift and advanced infotainment system with big screens with good tv options and the food (hummus sandwich and saffron cake) was complimentary and extremely delicious. If Flydubai keeps this experience consistent, I might consider them for my regular Dubai getaways.

### "Dirty seats and airplane"
Dirty seats and airplane. 5 hours flight with one choice of meal (Chicken pasta), and meal supposed to contain salads, drinks and others, but for Flydubai is just one piece. All flight entertainments are paid, so you have no meal and entertainments services for 5 hours flight. Did complain to flight service manager, and the only answer I got, which is, this is Flydubai policy.

### "disappointed about everything"
I am disappointed about everything inside this trip. There is not enough space between the seats. The services are awful almost nothing is included inside the plane. There was some food but very little, not even water there are not providing you if you require additional. There is no free entertainment, you have to pay for everything. I have flown with many companies along the last 14 years, but this was one of my worst experience that I had.

### "The weakest airline"
The weakest airline both in terms of service and in-flight service. Due to the delay of one of their flights, I missed the other two flights. They did nothing for me.

### "Traumatic experience"
Traumatic experience on 9/11/2022. Sat in the Aircraft without taking off for more than 2.5 hours. Air-conditioning ineffective. It was only after a near revolt by the passengers that they decided to let us disembark without any clear indication of what next? Not a single FlyDubai employee to guide the passengers. Some Arabic speaking passengers were given some kind of information. The rest of us just sat there. Finally boarded the same aircraft 4 hours later. Again sat without taking off for about 1 Hour. Finally reached Dubai 7 hours late. Very poor handling on board as well as from FlyDubai After sales team.

### "a disappointing experience"
Very poor customer service and a disappointing experience. Avoid if you can. This company offers a budget service far worse than other competitors and when flights get cancelled only offers a voucher instead of a refund.

### "I wish I read the reviews earlier"
Not Verified |  Absolute garbage airline. I flew my wife out with my 1 year old daughter buying tickets a week in advance. Not only was it 3x normal rate. When my wife got to the gate, they took her stroller to baggage claim, a stroller we flew with many times on different airlines claiming it’s not allowed on theirs. I spoke with a "customer care" agent who was non stop telling me their policy is against strollers on board. So I found their policy online on their site and had to prove them wrong. My wife got stuck on a 6 hour transfer stroller less. No service. As everyone knows, no refunds. God awful company, how and why people fly with them is beyond me, but once for me is enough, I wish I read the reviews earlier. Movies on a 2000$ flight cost money, meal is god awful. Stay away.

### "service from the attendants was appalling"
I have flown a lot, and this trip rates as the worst I have ever experienced. I flew DXB - Zanzibar return (FZ1687 and FZ1688), outward on 10/10/2022 and return 18/10/2022. The service from the attendants was appalling with only a plastic cup of water offered to drink with a sub standard meal. Attitude from the attendants was also poor. They preferred to sit in the back of the plane and do nothing than attend to passengers. The seating was uncomfortable and crammed, and the air conditioner was set uncomfortably high. I tried booking the emergency exit row for more space (prepared to pay) but it was not available online, and on embarking they were open but snapped up by passengers paying on the spot. All in all a really poor experience for an expensive flight. If I have a choice I will never use FlyDubai again.

### "Don't expect any level of good service from the customer service"
Not Verified |  I was supposed to fly from Qatar to Dubai on the coming weekend and due to personal issues, I had to cancel my booking with FlyDubai. After deducting the penalty (which is understandable), they gave me a refund as a voucher. Who needs a voucher? I can't get back the money that I paid and that too after deducting the penalty? Don't expect any level of good service from the customer service. It was just horrible and they refuse to give information or pass on the situation to a higher authority. I have flown with FlyDubai last year from Georgia to Dubai and they have rescheduled my flight twice and that is just how pathetic their services are. I am so disgusted by their service.

### "airline is not cheap: their customer service is"
The entire holidays was booked well in advance, visas included. FZ cancelled not only the flight but the entire destination and they still want to give us a voucher instead of full cash refund. Their Condition of Carriage DOES NOT contemplate the issuance of a voucher in case THEY cancel the entire destination, but only if the passenger cancels because of a change in schedule. There is not even the Covid excuse now. Never seen such an incompetent customer service. Thankfully we didn't book business class as originally planned! Not to mention that "the credit card system is down" excuse has been used for the past several months and they force you to pay cash only (or via direct bank transfer), just to avoid bank charges. If it was a super-cheap company I would understand, but this airline is not cheap: their customer service is!

### "It was a humiliating experience"
FlyDubai was my first leg of a 4 flight journey travelling with a 2yo child. I was carrying a basic folding travel pram which I was told during checkin could be carried on board to make life easier at each airport stopover. On boarding with FlyDubai the flight crew immediately started to make excuses as to why it was actually not possible to bring the pram on board; it’s not safe, does it fold, you will take up two spaces (I booked two seats so?) and they made me stand at the door to the plane while everyone else boarded insisting that only then would they see if there was enough space to take it. Standing with a child while different crew members gave me their own reasons why it’s not possible - one raising her voice and even threatening me by saying 5 passengers had been kicked off previous flights that day!) It was a humiliating experience, I was told beforehand it would be okay, and I was standing with a child the whole time with a long flight ahead of me. When everyone has boarded, one of the crew followed me to my seat and watched as I loaded the pram overhead. It’s so skinny when folded that it went in without any problem and there was plenty of space for everyone else’s bags. Honestly, the whole situation could have been avoided if they had simply helped.

### "It’s outrageous and bad branding"
I booked Emirates from Dubai to Salalah. Flight was operated by Flydubai. I was flying to Salalah because I was participating in a cycling race. I needed of course to take a bicycle. I thought it would be fine given that I had booked though Emirates and I have flown numerous times with my bike. I thought everything was fine. However I was wrong. Since the leg was operated by FlyDubai apparently my normal luggage allowance was not taken into consideration. Even though my bike was within my allowance for size and weight flydubai denied taking it on board. Initially upon booking they told me to ring 24hrs prior to flight to confirm my sports equipment. Emirates never asked this but I thought on this occasion I would try. However when doing so I was told that the flight was full and they couldn’t load my bike. They made me book an additional and separate cargo shipment for my luggage for what I had to pay an had to pay extra 1000aed and go through the hassle of arranging and picking up at Dubai cargo terminal. And to my very surprise I then found out that they actually loaded my bike on same flight as I was booked on! Many of my colleagues never called to confirm booking and they got their bicycles on the plane, for free with no hassle. I was furious. Why did I have to pay all this extra money. FlyDubai is a cheap airline that use fraudulent upselling techniques to get more money out of the passengers. Why couldn’t they just have taken my luggage on board as normal like they did with everyone else. Don’t understand what a reputable airline, like Emirates, would work together with flydubai. It’s outrageous and bad branding.

### "I haven't got any real help"
They lost my baby stroller during the interchange in Dubai. The baby stroller has been delivered in a few days, but as I already went to another city I was not able to get it from the airport. They don't deliver it to your address, you have to pick it up from the airport yourself. When I got a baby stroller, some important parts weren't there. I've contacted flydubai baggage service team and claimed that we can't use the baby stroller without those parts as it's just not safe, but for more than 10 days and more than 4 emails already I haven't got any real help.

### "failure to manage the time of the flights"
Not Verified | Dubai to Tabuk. I'm waiting for my boarding and I was just shouted at for a simple misunderstanding. They asked me to come 4 hours in advance simply to cover for their failure to manage the time of the flights.

### "Worst airline I have ever flown"
Not Verified |  Worst airline I have ever flown with in my life, where do I start? We were treated like cattle during boarding and the crew was very cold and short-tempered. Food was also absolutely vile. My mother also ended up getting sick from the air conditioning in the aircraft, they refused to give her a blanket.

### "worst flight I have ever been on"
I booked a ticket from an airline from Muscat to Batumi round ticket. My original flight from Dubai to Muscat was canceled, and I was forced to have 11 hours to transit which, if I had known from the start, I would have picked another option to fly. This caused me to rent a room outside the airport to sleep before my morning flight. My flight from Batumi to Dubai was delayed 4 hours, and no compensation or apologies was offered. At 5 am, 2 hours before my flight from Dubai to Muscat, I received a message that the flight would have a further delay from 7 am till 14:45. No apparent reason why, although there were no more sandstorms, and all flights were operating just fine. Someone decided this flight could delay, and other fights could go on. This delay caused me to miss another flight from Muscat to Salalah scheduled at 11:40 am with Salam Air which was not refundable. At the airport, I was trying to find ways to leave before 14:45, so I could meet my commitment in Salalah before 17:00. I checked if I could be offloaded from the flight so I could take my bags and leave on a flight with Oman air at 11:00 am. At first, they told me I could, and I went and purchased the flight from Oman air and another flight from Oman air from Muscat to Salalah at 16:30. I asked them to offload me and directed me to the arrival area to collect my bag. I went there and discovered that it was impossible because I could only collect my bag after the flight takeoff after 14:45. This means that both flights I purchased are now useless. I spoke to the people at the airport, and they only advised me to wait for the flight; otherwise, I would lose my bag. 5. I waited for my flight at 14:45. I have been in transit at the airport for 19 hours with no apparent reasons and no clarification. They started to board people at the gate at 14:20. Here, I realize another delay is happening. The flight only took off at 15:35, which again caused me to miss my flight from Muscat to Salalah at 16:30. Overall, this is the worst flight I have ever been on and caused me so much money for a hotel, transportation, and missed flights.

### "worst experience I've ever had"
The worst experience I've ever had. After a fantastic trip, it ended with this disastrous flight. First, the ticket didn't write about which terminal is our departure terminal, so we were confused and got off at the wrong terminal. After a long walk and another taxi, we reached the right terminal, at the entrance, we figured out that the flight has a 1-hour delay at the screen board and will take off at 23 instead of 22, but when we asked the airline personnel when getting the boarding pass, they said no there is no delay with this flight, however the take-off time on boarding pass was written 21. At last, the flight took off at 23:20 after another 20 min delay on the bus! Seats were very close to each other and it was hard for me to sit with a height of 180cm. No food or water were served to us, and said your ticket did not include any food, but our friend with the same ticket got a meal, also they were not happy with their meals. Then stewardesses collected left meals and dishes in plastic bags in their hands and talked loudly to themselves, what a disgusting scene! And at last, this disaster finished with an awful landing.

### "Terrible service overall"
Terrible service overall. Staff were bad, aircraft is old and uncomfortable, one poor meal option. Flight delayed by 3 hrs on the way back. I have never seen anything worse than that in my life.

### "treated with contempt and indifference"
Heartless, soulless staff and company. I am disgusted and appalled at what is the worst travel experience of my entire life with this airline. This is the first time I have flown with FlyDubai and rest assured it will be my last. One hour into my flight I became very feverish and experienced symptoms that correlated with gastroenteritis. I became visibly shaky and the passengers directly adjacent to me became concerned with my wellbeing and I moved to an empty extra legroom seat which I subsequently paid for. I asked for a blanket which was refused by the air hostess supervisor who explained that the blankets were reserved for business class passengers only. She made extremely mocking gestures to me as I continued to shake and I explained that the AC was extremely low and if I kept shaking I will throw up. I have never seen anyone with as much disregard for the duty of passenger care as her. The remainder of the passengers next to me were shocked at how nonchalant she was about the situation. When I threw up in the isle, she took little notice and instructed the other flight attendants to clean it up. It was only after seeing me continue to shake that she then brought a blanket and made several extremely condescending and rude comments "now you will be happy yeah? as I sat visibly shaking. I wrapped myself in the blanket and she woke me several times to ask me why I wasn't sitting in the correct seat and I told her I would pay but I was clearly unwell and that's why I decided to move. She had such little care for how I was feeling and disregarded the sanctity of the human condition in front of her. Just because I didn't book business class does not mean I am to be treated subhuman and woken several times when I am trying to sleep through the fever. I paid for the seat and requested paracetamol several times, and my request was ignored several times. This airline had a duty of care towards a really sick passenger and I was treated with contempt and indifference. My complaint to FlyDubai was summarily dismissed and no compensatory effort attempted.

### "Very poor service and communication"
Very poor service and communication. First they advised that the flight will be delayed by 1 hour. Later they made us board the aircraft and kept us waiting locked up in the plane for another 3 hours. Big delays in the bus transporting us from the terminal to the aircraft. Not a single apology from the airline officials after they made us disembark from the first aircraft and transported us back to the terminal and got us to board a 2nd aircraft. Total delays 6 hours without food. Worst ever experience.

Total delays 6 hours without food. Worst ever experience.

### "we had a really bad experience"
Not Verified |  Unfortunately we had a really bad experience with Flydubai. Their service is rubbish, stuff not experienced not polite. Poorly talking to people and trying to tell you indirectly it’s a cheap flight so it’s a cheap service. Please save yourself time, effort, stress day and fly a good airline. It’s a clean plane but not happy with the staff and even the service staff at terminal 2 not nice as well.

### "they weigh all hand luggage"
Cheap flights but they weigh all hand luggage and try to scam you there. $90 USD for 5kg of luggage. They made me go to an ATM and get cash out (they don’t take card). ATM fee was $5. Never flying with this airline again.

### "I was five minutes late"
The worst airline I have ever flown with. They are delayed, leave passengers on the run way waiting in very hot conditions with air conditioning on. The latest flight with them, I was five minutes late, was not allowed to board. I was not transferred to a later flight I had to pay over £1000 British pound for another flight, only 1 hour away . Please do not travel with this airline , it will be the worst experience you could ever imagine .

### "never fly with this airline again"
I will never fly with this airline again. Seats are extremely uncomfortable, definitely not enough staff as they had to run around the plane back and forward attending to people. The entertainment are movies, games, and tv shows which are abundant, and all of these are behind a paywall, but i believe it is worth it. Overall not worth flying Flydubai, as even the cheap price cannot justify the poor flying experience that a person has.

### "disregard they treat customers with"
The worst customer service ever! I have booked my ticket yesterday and due to the poor mobile booking application date picker the date selected was 2 days earlier then my actual return date. I called the customer service immediately and they told me that I have to pay modification fee of 200 USD when the entire ticket cost was the same and the ticket on that day was even cheaper! Following the advise of the operator I send an email informing me exactly the same without regard to my request whatsoever. I don’t normally fly with flyDubai but for sure after this experience I will not repeat that. They spoiled my entire vacation before it even started. And not because of this ridiculous policies, but because Of the disregard they treat customers with. If I had a choice I would have never chosen this airline but as at the moment this is the only direct flight to Sofia I have no other choice.

### "Worst ever experience with Flydubai"
Worst ever experience with Flydubai. First shock was given by the guy who are standing before the passenger ques to allow them to go inside while he was asking everybody where are you going. In our turn he asked us and when we answered to Madinah He immediately responded the flight is cancelled. I told him how come it is possible as its a Hajj flight, he said don't know go to flydubai counter. We went over there and they said its not cancelled, rather delayed, you can go and take the boarding pass. We took the boarding pass and went inside. The other shock was inside when the flight was delayed initially for 1hr then later showed in the screen almost more than 3 hrs - nobody explaining and no announcement made that what is going on. Then our return flight with same airline but from Jeddah, which although boarding on right time but delayed about 1 hr and we were sitting in the plane without proper air-conditioning and nobody announced the delay and the Captain didn't say any single word in the whole flight about the delay or do apology.

### "expected way more from this airline"
Not Verified |  I expected way more from this airline due to the fact that the money they ask for approximately equals the ticket price of high-level airlines like Qatar Airways or so. For sure it does not worth the money. They do not provide the service at all (they did not have any blankets even though we were okay to pay for them) or they sell the service (which is expected and okay if you are traveling with inexpensive airlines but that does not include flydubai for sure). The staff was not helping at all even though they would promise to.

### "2 hours waiting on the plane without AC"
Its one if the worst experience I have had in this past few months. They let us burn and waiting for the Maintenance to do their job. Probably we spent 2 hours waiting on the plane without AC. It’s only shows and Approve the lack of supervision and how decision can make a different. This should not happen and we should not waiting for someone to happen and trying to fix it.

### "definition of Paying more for Less"
I had sworn to never fly with Flydubai after an 8 hour delay in 2016. However, after booking with Emirates I had no choice but to choose the codeshare agreement inbound flight with Flydubai because everything else was sold out due to the long weekend in Bahrain. DXB’s Terminal 2 (T2) is a flea market and there is nowhere to sit and eat in addition to the toilets smelling. Of course we were crammed in buses with zero distancing measures. The plane was super hot and the crew members looked like they were about to pass out. The Air Conditioners didn’t work properly and there was no monitors for in-flight entertainment. We were also provided with Flydubai’s baggage allowance which was less than Emirates. I can’t forgive Emirates for their codeshare flights via Flydubai because they are the literal definition of “Paying more for Less”. Flydubai is not even that cheap anymore when it comes to regional (GCC) flights. Avoid if you have other options. The staff were friendly and the male crew member in the economy cabin was very patient.

### "not recommend it to anyone"
Not Verified |  I had to change my flight but was asked to pay 450$ for each person and we are a family of 5, so I decided to was better to refund and it’s was refundable with penalty, unfortunately the penalty was 90% of the ticket, and even 10% was not refund in cash but voucher that has to be used only with fly Dubai and by same person only. I would not recommend it to anyone.

### "not providing good service"
Very poor management, flight delay too much. Very bad environment of flight, AC cooling very poor during this summer of Dubai. They are not providing good service.

### "experience was horrendously poor"
Not Verified |  This round trip flight experience was horrendously poor, starting with having to board a bus each way, from the tarmac to the aircraft, and climb/ descend a steel stairway in extreme heat. Why can your aircraft not pull up to a gate jetway and board/ deplane normally? What is your malfunction? On the return flight to Riyadh, we were herded like livestock and squeezed on top of each other into busses and made to sit there for 30-40 minutes, in 40+ degree heat, because the aircraft was still being fueled up. Why didn’t they just keep us in inside the terminal, at the gate, if the plane wasn’t ready, instead of treating us like animals? Passengers were asked to show ID and boarding passes at least 8 times (I counted), from the time we enter the airport, until boarding the plane, which was delayed because it wasn’t fueled. This is an understandable delay and does happen, but why subject us to the heat outside? If airport busses are shared by airlines, they weren’t going anywhere, anyway, overloaded and way over capacity. Is this standard operating procedure on FlyDubai, especially during a pandemic? We had to put our carry on belongings down on the ground when exiting the bus in 40 degree heat and before ascending the aircraft stairway to show ID and boarding pass. Do they think that a random, middle aged white woman just ran up on the tarmac from out of nowhere and is trying to board their plane to Riyadh? I was asked for ID again, for the 8th time, as I finally boarded the plane. They switched our seats, as well. Our boarding passes did not reflect the seats we initially chose, online, and someone was sitting in the seat I purchased, weeks earlier. Put others in the remaining seats. The flight attendants were very obviously in physical distress from the heat and stress of this fiasco and I was concerned about the one performing preflight safety procedures, who looked like she might pass out. As an experienced world traveler, I would not recommend FlyDubai, nor would I fly them again. The well being, safety and quality of flight for passengers is quite obviously, not a priority.

### "the airline does not stand behind its customers"
With all due respect, the airline does not stand behind its customers, something you need to seriously consider. I unfortunately flew with Flydubai, a Dubai-based airline, on Friday May 06, 2022 from Khartoum to Dubai. Upon arrival at the Dubai International Airport, I was not able to claim one of my 2 (two) checked-in bags on that flight. I have waited with the rest of the passengers at the conveyor belt at the baggage claim area until the belt topped declaring that all bags were delivered. However, I was not able to find my second bag. I asked for assistance at the airport and I was directed to the Dnata baggage services office who issued me an Irregularity Report (attached). After that, my dealings with Flydubai on the matter were not successful. The airline simply did not stand behind its business service of delivering my missing bag. This is despite the fact I have paid for such service within my ticket price. They claimed that since the bag was loaded and made it to the airport, then it is my responsibility to collet it. Of course I have done that, meaning waiting for my bag to show up on the belt but it did not. What else can I do? It is known internationally that it is the airline’s responsibility to deliver passengers’ bags and that the airline is responsible for any loses or delays regardless of what the cause of such loss or delay is.

### "They drop flights without notice"
Not Verified |  Hopeless. They drop flights without notice and the staff at Sarajevo airport couldn't care less. Absolutely pathetic. Such a shame that they are paired with an airline as good as Emirates.

### "a very dishonest company"
I had a ticket for this flight to fly to Dubai to join a cruise so it was imperative that I fly in time for the cruise departure. On checking their web site I noticed the flight was no longer listed. I then called their office in Istanbul and they informed me the flight was cancelled. I then sent an email to flydubai in Dubai and they assured me that my flight will depart on that date. I explained to them that I must depart on that particular date because of the cruise. They again assured me the flight will depart, A week before departure I received a message the flight was cancelled and after some correspondence they agreed to give me a refund. Well that was a year ago and I am still waiting for that refund. I have written to then on a number of occasions and every time I am told they are working on my refund. flydubai is nothing but a bunch of thieves and liars, a very dishonest company. How is it possible for airline like this to get accreditation with IATA?

### "I am very unhappy with this flight"
I am very unhappy with this flight, I paid almost 2000 DHS for a short trip. They served the food until the middle of the plane and after that they said there was no option to choose a meal and also they served coffee to the first 5 or 6 rows and stopped and they said it is for your safety. This is not comparable with Emirates.

### "The staff were very rude"
The worst airline ever. The staff were very rude and they didn’t even have enough food to give to the passengers as some passengers were asked whether they wanted chicken biriyani or mutton biriyani and the rest of the passengers were not asked and they got vegetarian biriyani. They didn’t serve coffee to us while the rest of the passengers received it and after we told them they said sorry and gave it to us. There was a French lady who was so rude to us to be quick on putting all the luggage on the top. The seats were not comfortable at all. The staff should always remember that we do pay money and we are not begging from them. They didn’t even have any courtesy in greeting us upon going back. The food was not tasty at all and when I was eating my biriyani she wanted the plastic tray which had the bun and water and didn’t have any courtesy to come later even though I was eating, when I told her she was telling me that she needs it immediately as if I’m going to run with the tray. So I recommend no one to fly with them.

### "highly unprofessional and unethical"
The support staff at the Mumbai counter is highly unprofessional and unethical. I was traveling along with my toddler who just turned 4, hence I couldn't carry 2 hand luggage of 7 each. So I made 1 bag of 14kg. When I reached the counter at the Mumbai international airport I explained that I am traveling with excess check -in baggage which I shall pay for! She asked for my hand luggage which I informed her I have 1 bag of 14kg as per our allowance but she was not co-operative and very rudely informed me that I am not allowed to make 1 bag of 14kg. I politely informed her I am traveling with a toddler so I can't carry 2 hand bags hence traveling with 1 hand baggage of 14kg. But she was not ready to hear me out and asked me to make each bag of 7 kg and didn't check me in till I got that done. I had to call my parents back near the airport entry and had to give away some of my stuffs so that I could accommodate 2 bags of 7kg. It was such a hassle to run back and forth to counter H to check if the weights are ok. After doing all that I went back to her counter and said it's all done! Imagine what she says - she tells me I'll check-in your hand luggage also so that you can travel hassle free. I said if that was the case you could have just checked in my 1 bag of 14kg why did you make me go through all that trouble! Just because of her incompetence I faced so many issues. If she could have just checked in my hand bagged in the 1st place everything would have been a smooth process and my journey would have been great and not frustrating.

### "I do not recommend this airline"
Extremely unhelpful staff. A few weeks before departure, Fly Dubai changed the time of my first flight which changed the landing time to the time my connecting flight would take off. I have spoken with multiple representatives and all told me that they could not assist me in changing my flight, that they could not move me to the next available flight despite this situation being the fault of the company. I will have to purchase a new flight and will absolutely not be flying with Fly Dubai. I do not recommend this airline.

### "they were very professional"
The aircraft was a new one and the seats are comfortable. I would like to thank all the cabin crew today on my trip DXB to RUH, they were very professional, service was very fast and they dimmed the light to gave an opportunity to rest a bit despite its a short flight. The IFE was full of new movies, TV shows and Games.

### "service is very weak"
Worst airline someone could travel on, service is very weak, very slow staff and procedures starting from the check-in until departure everything was happening in slow motion. Departure was at 8:45 am and the busses arrived for pickup at 9:00. Prices are very high.

### "crew were grumpy and definitely unhappy"
Tel Aviv airport was a nightmare as you need to pass through strict security in order to approach the check-in counters and there is no fast track facility at this point for business class passengers. The staff were very nice and I got checked in very quickly. The lounge is a shared one and the lesser said the better as it was just an awful dump. The flight was not one of the ones that I would ever like to repeat again. The crew were grumpy and definitely unhappy in doing their job. The seat is supposed to be a flatbed but it literally squeezes your legs in a cubby hole space and you are trapped. The hot meal of mushroom risotto was a joke compared to the description on the menu and you need to search for the mushrooms. Toilets are appalling and you can barely squeeze yourself inside. An experience that I really would never like to repeat again with this awful airline.

### "this is an airline to be avoided"
The level of service due to the attitude of the crew is appalling! Not a single staff had a smile and were sulking all through the flight. I was fortunate that this particular flight departed from terminal 3 or else I would have had to face the mess of terminal 2 in addition. The seats are new but the pitch is unacceptably tight. The worst part is the toilet which can barely squeeze an adult and I am not talking about any obese adult but a normal weighted guy! No wifi in a so-called latest being plane. My fare had a meal included and the choice was an omelet with potatoes or only potatoes!! The meal was served in a paper packet. The only plus point for me was the schedule but this is an airline to be avoided.

### "The worst airline in my life"
The worst airline in my life. I purchased tickets including meal and they gave me 100 ml of water for 4.5 hour flight, and the cabin crew was behaving very rude and he was telling me to buy water by own payment.

### "avoid taking flydubai"
Not Verified | Kolkata to Dubai. One of the worst airlines I have ever flown with. They charged me 6147.94 for extra 3kgs in my checked in luggage. When I asked the lady to call her manager, he came and talked to her, not even bothered to ask me for any concern. I even told them that I can remove a kg from it but they did not agree. I have flew many international flights (Qatar, Etihad, Air India, Lufthansa etc.) before but never had this kind of experience. Plus there was no entertainment screens on the flight and also meal was pathetic. Also, WiFi was also not working on this flight. Please try to avoid taking flydubai.

### "seats are so uncomfortable"
FlyDubai is one of the worst airlines I have ever traveled with. Their prices are extremely high, the seats are so uncomfortable. In addition, the flight took an hour more than the usual. The hostess was so unfriendly and mean. The exit seats were all empty and we were not allowed to sit there as we had to pay extra money.

### "the worst experience for me"
The experience of flying with Fly Dubai was the worst experience for me of flying ever. I had booked a connecting flight from Zanzibar to Mumbai via dubai for 22,000 rupees. Due to an emergency, i had approached the airline to retain my booking till dubai and cancel by further booking to Mumbai. Most uncooperative airline ever, I had offered to pay for the new tickets from Dubai to Trivandrum that I required. The action Would have costed nothing to the airline (infact would have gained by reselling the Dubai Mumbai ticket). However, even just the cancellation of the same also the airline declined. The icing on cake was when I finally tried to board the flight from Zanzibar on 17 March 2022. I was shocked to hear that I can't check in my luggage because I have not booked for luggage ie. i have booked tickets without check-in luggage. I mean is that even allowed to sell such tickets? They charged me 300usd. The uncooperative attendant of the airline is like we don't accept card. You need to take out shillings, convert to usd and then give us. 1 hour before departure I was running around the city to get the money converted. Was charged 300 dollars for the one check in luggage I had. Receipt of the same is uploaded. Please ready each document carefully before booking with flydubai. They have the text in smallest print for you to miss reading it and want you to book the cheapest option, then to charge you exorbitantly during check in. The meanest, uncooperative and cunning airline i have ever experienced. Best part was after landing in Mumbai, the aircraft developed a technical snag which caused the airline to stay standing for about 50mins at de-boarding gates with no means to connecting the skywalk. I almost missed my further connecting flight due to this. It was worst experience of flying ever for me. Will ensure never to fly with them ever.

### "One of the worst airlines"
One of the worst airlines you can think of. I booked for my honeymoon to Maldives from Doha. But unfortunately due to covid situation of my wife I had to cancel it. I tried to call customer service, send email with medical certificate and also texted in social media to cancel my flight with full refund since it was unexpected situation. But no one replied or have answer my calls. I was bound to cancel it online with penalty of $220. And they have provided a voucher that is valid only for a year and also valid for the same passenger. Finally after a month I received an email saying that they can't provide refund in cash and they can't do anything else. What a Rubbish policy is this?

### "still fighting for the refunds"
Not Verified |  Worst flight ever. The staff was rude. They canceled our tickets when we were traveling back home from Ahmedabad to New York without giving us any updates or email and we came to know when we stood in the line for the bags check in for literally 3 hours. They didn’t let us board or helped us accommodate in any other flights. And we are still fighting for the refunds. I will never fly FlyDubai neither I would recommend it to anyone.

### "No cash refund possible"
Not Verified |  My wife and me had a flight to Zanzibar via Dubai on 31st December returning on 11th January. Both flights were cancelled three days before. No response or support from the company. We had to incur additional costs of USD 1.000. 35 days later I got a response via E-Mail that I can get a rebook or a voucher, which is obviously useless. No cash refund possible. I will never fly with this company.

### "I wasn’t provided my dinner"
Not Verified | I had a flight Dubai to Helsinki and I wasn’t provided my dinner though it was included in my ticket. The air hostess didn’t even care to ask, though she was fully co-operative with the man sitting next to me. And I was starving. Also even though I asked them (air hostesses) again for food they didn’t care at all.

### "This is a terrible airline"
This is a terrible airline and must be shut down! This flight from Dubai to Beirut was my worst nightmare. Although we paid for an Emirates Airlines ticket but we got on the way back this horrible company. The staff is so rude, food is horrible!, and entertainment is null. Imagine you are flying for over 4hr without knowing where you are or how many hours left of the flight! Seats are terribly uncomfortable and toilets were so dirty!

### "One of the worst airlines"
One of the worst airlines. We were a family of 4 (with 2 kids) travelling from Kolkata to Dubai to connect to our next flight to Zurich. Forget any kind of greetings or smiles, they would run down the aisle fast without looking around as if to deliberately shove you back to your seat. Its a pity that Emirates has them as a partner airline connecting the Kolkata passengers to Dubai. The impression is so bad even with one single flight (this was my first time ever with flyDubai) that I will altogether skip Emirates bookings for the Kolkata-Zurich segment from now on. Its not like we paid any less for the route (they charged us the same peak December/ January rate as any other airline). The aircraft looked like a cheap domestic carrier flying an international segment. Forget TV screens or anything fancy, they didn't even have basic pouch bags in seats where we can keep our small items. I wouldn't even comment on the seats quality (it reclined like 2°), and the leg space was just about there to fit in my legs (and I am not even fat). Last but not the least, once our kid strayed over to a more leg-space seat (one next to the emergency exits), and prompt came the rude interjection "please pay extra 200 USD if you want to use that seat").

### "awful experience with FlyDubai"
Not Verified | I had an awful experience with FlyDubai, very surprised, upset and disappointed. The customer services is awful and did not solve the issue with my broken carry-on luggage, they did not want to take responsibility of how their employees work and how they behave. I had no hand luggage except one small box with fragile porcelain item inside, which I was carrying on with me. Right in the moment when I was getting on a plane, the Flydubai representative insisted on giving the box to the airplane baggage compartment (as well as hand luggages of other passengers) telling that there is no space left inside the plane and I am not able to take my hand luggage with me. I was begging him to let me take me fragile box with me on the board but he refused my request and took it from me. In addition when I took my seat, I mentioned that there was still plenty of space for the hand luggage so I really did not understand why he had not allowed passengers to take our hand luggage inside. When I took my baggage upon arrival of course the item inside the box was broken. When I wrote plenty of times to the FlyDubai customer support patiently describing the situation with photos, the only responses I received were the stupid automatic responses that they are not "responsible for damaged checked baggage". They are even not reading my emails explaining that it was not the checked baggage, it was the carry-on hand luggage. Very disappointed. Do not want to fly with them any more.

### "shame the staff can't be upgraded"
The cabin crew on this flight were a disgrace. After take off they were all at the back of the plane eating croissants and drinking coffee. As they didn't want anyone to disturb their little get together they put engaged on the toilets and if anyone stood up they told them to sit down because of turbulence. The skies were clear and not a bump the whole time. After a while I insisted on using the toilet and one stewardess asked another if its ok, she retorted "whatever" and didn't even turn around. This was their attitude the whole flight, disinterested in customers, doing the minimum possible, and being rude. Positive: planes are upgraded and nice, shame the staff can't be upgraded and nice as well.

### "worst airline that I've experienced"
It's the worst airline that I've experienced in my life. Do not book it. Everything is so low class and very very poor service. From the staff at airport. They speak to you like you fly for free! Very rude. Almost everyone. On board the seat is very bad. They give you 2 croissant. I couldn't even move my legs. On the way back. I decided to upgrade to business class on board as they had 1 seat left. They called me from eco seat to business seat. I sat there for 15 mins they came to take payment. Said my card doesn't go through. Said not accepted debit card only credit card. I only have prepaid credit card. So I told them take my cash and take the rest from prepaid credit card since inside not enough what they want but I do have cash. Only lacking 400 qar and prepaid credit card has .. they said no, can't. No Internet for me to contact my husband to refill the credit card. Not accept cash. Not accept debit card. They kicked me out to same eco seat I was so embarrassed No morals.

### "never fly with this airline again"
Not Verified | Lost baggage, which seems to be a common occurrence with Flydubai. Very small seats making flight uncomfortable. I will never fly with this airline again. Every convenience must be paid for. They don't seem to be able to handle transit flights with checked in luggage.

### "Awful experience all in all"
Started with the check in they were very unorganised, they had all designations in same queue and we almost missed our flight because of them. The leg space is very small, and seats are not comfortable at all. On our flight back to Dubai, we landed at 4:30 am and were waiting until 7 am and our luggage didn't come out yet. Awful experience all in all.

### "forgot all bags in Dubai during transit"
I traveled this flight on 2 November from Dubai to Ahmedabad. however, they forgot all bags in Dubai during transit. unfortunately, I declare about by 3 bag missing but till 2 days no reply even I call often his office number. Even I come from west Africa to celebrate Diwali I don't have any personal belong clothes or things which I bought from there. I don't know how they manage flight schedule and language management because it's worse.

### "inflight service excellent"
I was pleasantly surprised with how professional and friendly the cabin crew were on this flight. The head purser was exceptional in the Business class cabin. It was a shame that there was a last minute aircraft sub from the B737Max but the cabin was clean and immaculate. The amenities were good and inflight service excellent given the length of the flight.

### "like to thank the cabin crew"
I would like to thank the cabin crew on the flight from Kolkata to Dubai. We were travelling with 2 toddlers from our family vacation. Toddlers were restless during the flight and disturbing other passengers. The Cabin crew were very considerate, understanding our situation and trying their best to manage the situation. Emily, the air hostess even entertained and kept my son occupied for a while to calm his energy down.

### "Stay away from them"
Will deduct unjustified amount from your refund even if they cancelled ticket themselves. Why consumers are punished with this deduction during hard pandemic time Absolutely fraudulent company. Exploit consumers during hardest times of Pandemics. Will deduct huge amount even if cancel ticket themselves. Stay away from them.

### "I wouldn't recommend this airline"
We were flying from Tirana to Male, Maldives for honeymoon. Our baggage didn't arrive and then they said we will check they answer very late in emails or don't answer at all. We were having a very difficult time in Maldives because we don't have any clothes with us. And two days remaining to our vacation now, still no baggage still, no information. I wouldn't recommend this airline.

### "poor coronavirus management"
Not Verified |  Bad Management, impolite cabin crew, poor meal, poor coronavirus management in the aircraft for passengers. If you want to travel to Emirate, you should travel by Emirates Airlines.

### "disrespectful customer service"
Very disrespectful customer service. Due to covid they made me change the flight booking more than 7 times in a row, as the flights weren't operating. I didn't have any problem with that as I understand the issue until they called me and told me to cancel the booking and they will refund me. I ended up getting a voucher which was valid for a period of time since I'm using that ticket for one of my labor I reused to book a flight which was done perfectly and smoothly until I received a call telling me that the person isn't allowed to board to the flight as his residence visa is issued from Sharjah and not Dubai (I'm fine with that as its the law of the country now). As a result, I requested a refund so that I may use the ticket later but flyDubai rejected the refund as it was booked using a voucher (from the previous booking) and an additional fee. Calling didn't work and complaining didn't work they are basically stealing money.

### "Truly horrible disappointing"
Knowing this is a low cost carrier, I didn't expect much from the flight. But it was shocking to learn that checked-in luggage was forced open (for inspection?) and the lock was damaged as a result. I checked in Samsonite luggage with TSA-approved lock. I checked everything else (wheels, body of luggage etc) quickly after we collected the luggage and left airport. Little did I know, the lock was damaged until we left airport. Called the customer service and was told to email. So I did. And why am I not surprised when I got a reply saying lock is not not covered for claim? They brushed me off as if it's a scratch on the lock that I'm reporting right now. I don't know if the customer service agent who handled my case even tried to understand what happened! It's my first day of Europe trip and thanks to flydubai, now I have to travel with unlockable luggage! Truly horrible disappointing and unprofessional airline.

### "never recover money from flydubai"
Be very mindful when you book a ticket with them and take screenshot of every step of booking process. They will not take ownership of any mistake even if it is a system fault that can be justified. I booked last year a ticket with them. The price was given to me in AED, which is normal when origin destination is Dubai. Check the cancellation conditions and take screenshots as well. I booked a ticket for my mother From Dubai to Bucharest. I checked all details and ticket was processed in AED but sector was Bucharest - Dubai (a system error).I was told that it is clear due to currency that i booked correct sector and that the system does that mistake sometimes. I asked for a cancellation and refund and correction of error but they didn't take ownership. After many emails I was given a voucher that I could use for the same passenger and only for flights. I informed them that I will be unable to use it as my mother will not fly anymore. I asked to use voucher for luggage. None of this possible. It is a year almost and my money is with flydubai for a sector I never booked. I have a voucher that I cannot use. Don't bother to call, they will not answer. Don't bother to write. They will reply rudely, if at all. Just if you have no option for another airline, take screenshots of all steps in booking proces. Although I am not sure even that would be considered by them. Practically consider you have done a donation to flydubai if for some reason things go wrong regardless of whose fault. You will never recover money from flydubai.

### "Never book ticket with Flydubai"
Never book ticket with Flydubai. My flight was cancelled by airline just 18 hours before the check-in and given me coupon with 1 year validity as refund even I cant use it for someone. They don't answer on any number mentioned it on Online. You cant cancel it by online by manage booking option. In this process of getting refund as 13 days struggle they have booked 3 times and cancelled 2 times my ticket that I cant do anything I am just getting notification. Finally contacted by booking agent as conference call he was so rude that he wont help in anyways thats their company policy.

### "What miserable and unprofessional behavior"
What miserable and unprofessional behavior! They cancelled my return flight that was absolutely urgent and didn’t offer any reasonable solution! Those kind of companies shouldn’t exist - if you are not capable to provide at least decent customer service experience, then you are out! They even had a flight on the same day to a city close to mine but they weren’t willing to cooperate at all! Please think carefully before you make the same mistake as I did.

### "Two hour waiting in check-in line"
Two hour waiting in endless check-in line. Every third encounter was open and staff called late passengers every couple of minutes. When I noted that it would be easier for us to wait on bench for a call, one officer (with under nose mask) accused me that I am sarcastic and that "it is up to me".

### "Lousy customer service"
Lousy customer service they are already known for has not increased during the pandemic. I tried to cancel my flight (fully refundable ticket). In the Fklydubai app it clearly says: "Cancellations are refunded either in voucher or Skywards miles". It is misleading information, because of course you can not have Skywards miles, but only a voucher. Therefore if you have no intention to fly with Flydubai again in the future, think twice before booking, because in case you need to cancel, you may as well throw your ticket in the garbage.

### "Horrible back end service"
Horrible back end service - 10 emails exchanged - not a single call back on the complaint - don't care, go to hell customer attitude. Had done an error doing online booking  while changing time for the flight my baggage allowance was eaten up as selected lite wrongly and had to pay for it 350 dhs again - feel cheated. Not only that, on travelling out meal served while traveling back meal to be paid for. Feel that the airlines is banking on this attitude since no other direct flights are there from Dubai - surely will not last long.

### "Customer service is weak"
I have flown on FlyDubai a few times, and that is the main reason I try flying to Kathmandu via Qatar Airways instead of Emirates. FlyDubai is the only option between Dubai and Kathmandu, and the 5 hour flight is insufferable with uncomfortable seats and no entertainment. One improvement is offering food without additional fees, but other problems persist. Customer service is weak. They remain the most disorganized airline for check-in at Kathmandu. And now...during Covid, I witnessed their lack of safety enforcement. Two men in the row in front of me kept removing their masks. Three times they were warned before takeoff but they continued. I signalled the airline attendant that they continued their behavior, so this time she took their passports and boarding passes, returning with the pilot with a "final" warning. But 5 minutes later, they again removed their masks and attendants now just looked away. No safety enforcement.

### "suddenly they cancel flight"
I booked a ticket from Ahmedabad to Dubai on 23 April, suddenly they cancel flight and notify me. We selected 25 April 2021 flight and after 2 hours we received Dubai governance Notification that from 24 April all fights will banned from India. So we tried to communicate with flydubai though toll free number we mails around numbers of they didnt respond and in panic we have booked another flight though air Arabia because need to catch flight, either i will lose my job and many visa fees many things. Now we waiting for our refund from fly dubai that didn't respond yet. Now in their website they asked for fly dubai voucher and force to accept that voucher in Such covid pandemic where we need money for emergency.

### "Appreciate the effort of the ground service team"
Not Verified |  I had a very good experience with the ground service team. My luggage was 10 kg overweight, check in agent at the Fly Dubai counter suggested me to remove some not so important items and send it with the family if anyone was there to see me off, luckily my brother was still there and I removed some of the items and gave it to him. After that also it was 2 kg extra, ground staff asked if it was ok to take it in the cabin baggage to avoid paying anything extra. I followed her suggestion and didn’t have to pay anything extra. Appreciate the effort of the ground service team.

### "service was good"
Not Verified |  Travelled from Dubai to kolkata 2 days ago. Flight out was good and Covid19 norms was followed. Very courteous and friendly crew. Service was good, i wanted to have vegetarian meal but they ran out of the option, I had to take my medicine so crew arranged a spare vegetarian meal from business class for me (my meal was pre ordered). I was pleasantly surprised by the gesture of the staff and food tasted really good. I loved flying with Fly Dubai. I will surely recommend it to others.

### "I can promise you we will never ever fly with you again!"
Absolutely by far the worst airline company I have ever flown with! I would like to warn everybody about our experience with flydubai. Please, as much as possible, try to avoid them. We went on a beautiful trip to the Maldives leaving from Bucharest, Romania and having a stop in Dubai. Both flights on our way to the Maldives operated by flydubai were absolutely horrible. It all started when we reached the airport and wanted to check the option to upgrade our seats to business - as my wife is pregnant, we thought that it would be a good idea to make our flight a little more pleasant. We have asked at the check-in counter about the possibility to upgrade and we got the answer it will cost us 4,000$ per person (around 3 times the whole round trip just for one person and 1/4 part of the trip), since the price didn't make any sense the nice lady advised us to ask at the boarding counter. We reached the boarding counter and asked again, this time we were instructed to ask the plane crew when we would complete the boarding process. When we entered, we just got an answer "no" (in a very rude way). Needless to say, that the "Business class" was almost completely empty on that flight and we didn't ask for anything free, we really would pay if the price made sense. The seats in flydubai are extremely small and uncomfortable, even when compared to other low-cost companies this one was the worst. You can hardly incline the chair at all - having the button or not will make no difference. You get one very small "shot" of water (I call it shot because it's 100ml) for the whole 5 hours flight and it's mostly very hot during the flight. Now I wish this was all, but it was just the beginning. The next part was really what brought my wife and me to write this review. 2 days prior to our departure from Maldives back to Romania, flydubai informed us that our flight from Dubai to Bucharest was cancelled and moved on the next day. This basically meant that we will be stuck for around 19hrs in Dubai Airport in transit. We could not get out of the airport because of Covid regulations. We had only a small backpack and a purse, so we had to wear the same clothes for more than 24hrs (our main luggage went directly to Bucharest). In addition, we also had to take another day off from work, because the flight was moved on a working day. Now, normally I would get very upset for being in this situation, but now I was completely outraged because they were expecting my pregnant wife to sit for 19h on a bench in the airport without providing any accommodation/meals or any type of compensation. They simply cancelled the flight and took no responsibility nor accountability whatsoever for any consequence. I also attached a screenshot of their formal response after I explained the situation that we were in. We were warned before by our friends about their horrible experiences and advised not to use flydubai, but we said 'eh, what can happen? Well, this happened. Thank you flydubai on behalf of me and my pregnant wife for your service and for ruining the end of our vacation. I can promise you we will never ever fly with you again!

### "it was a great help"
Not Verified |  I was travelling with my 6 month old daughter. My husband couldn't join us because of some work commitment nevertheless I was able to manage all by myself, thankfully Fly Dubai allows to carry strollers in the cabin, although I had to purchase the stroller meeting permissible size and weight but it was a great help.

### "Our journey was efficient"
Not Verified |  Nothing to complain about. Our journey was efficient and everything ran smoothly. Check in was quick (although we couldn’t check in online beforehand - we were flying from Zanzibar and so apparently you can’t check in online), the flight departed 10 minutes late but then made up the time in the air and arrived perfectly on time. The plane even waited a few minutes for a couple of passengers that were running late. We brought our own food so can’t comment on the food available for purchase. All round a great experience for a budget airline - we would recommend.

### "no social distancing"
Worst airline experience ever, used to pick them first time and never want to use again. For 1850aed/30kg one way flight I’ve got no space, dirty, old, no social distancing - head on head, unbelievable service - for example no drink on board during a 7h flight. No entertainment available, no pillow/blankets, and the flight took 1.5hr more than concurrent Dubai airlines.

### "the aircraft was clean"
Not Verified |  I flew by FlyDubai yesterday from Doha. It was my first flight after Qatar and Dubai opening their doors for each other after almost 3 years. Boarding was slightly delayed due to the late arrival of incoming aircraft. It was a full fight so to avoid further delay, we were taken to aircraft immediately. We waited in the coach at the tarmac for not more than 10 minutes and the aircraft was clean and well arranged. Flight attendants were warm and friendly, she made sure everyone was wearing their mask during the journey. Service was good. Landing was smooth. It was a nice experience.

### "such a sweet and thoughtful gesture"
Not Verified |  My wife and I were travelling to Yerevan, Armenia for our 1st wedding anniversary celebrations a few days and we had booked Fly Dubai flight for our travel. This was out first flight since covid hit the world. This is an appreciation post for the wonderful service we got from Fly Dubai. Apart from good COVID safety precautions, we also had a quite comfortable flight. I had a brief conversation with one of the cabin crew members where I might have mentioned the reason of our travel. The same crew walked up to my wife just before the landing and gave her a sweet handwritten note wishing us on our 1st anniversary. It was such a sweet and thoughtful gesture. We will always cherish this beautiful experience. It was beyond our expectations. We definitely recommend it to everyone.

### "staff is not well trained"
Fly Dubai’s Staff are untrained and very unprofessional. When I went to catch my flight (FZ 8760/FZ 1729) to Kiev (via Dubai) on 23Dec19 at Delhi Airport, the lady at the check-In told me that to take this flight I need a UAE transit visa. So you can’t fly today. I tried to explain her several times that it’s a connecting flight and stopover at Dubai Airport (DXB, airport) for 3:45 hours only and I have no plan to go outside airport. I told her that I am a Ukraine permanent resident and I fly Ukraine frequently and never required visa for stopover or connecting flight if it’s from same airport, but she told me to get UAE visa before flight and refuse to entertain me. When I insist, she called another guy, he said UAE has changed the rule and now you need a visa even to change flight in UAE. I had few hours to get transit visa before my fight at Delhi airport. I was coming straight from city Varanasi (800km, around 12 hours’ drive). I called all my friend & family and even tried to contact UAE embassy to know the change in Visa rules. Finally, I got through UAE immigration lawyer and he told me that I don’t need UAE visa to change flight within same airport and suggested me to talk to airlines supervisor. After 30 continues request, when I meet supervisor, he said I don’t need UAE visa to change flight. That one hour was my life longest and worst hour. My experience with this airline was very devastated and I recommend not to use this airline. Their staff is not well trained (specially staff in India) and unprofessional.

### "they rip you off"
130 USD for updating a one letter typo in my name. Yes I made a typo but it is still just my name, how can a company charge such an outraging amount for a honest typo mistake ? When I asked to then cancel my ticket (with a penalty of 80 USD), they said that they can only give me a voucher valid 1 year on the same trip. I still did as 80USD was cheaper than the correction but this company is a scam, they rip you off. Stay away.

### "cabin crew who was very rude"
Not Verified |  I flew on December 9 from Bishkek to Dubai flight number FZ 1462. I was sitting in the very last seat of the 32A plane. There was a cabin crew who was very rude. There were people waiting in line for the toilet, she was very harsh with passengers. I asked her name, and she went to the conflict with me. I couldn't see her badge, so I asked for her name. Then when I went to the bathroom, on my return I didn't find my coke and the cap I put in the seat . I don't know where she put it. I was shocked how they select such personnel?

### "staff are so irresponsible"
This is the worst airline I’ve travelled through The baggage staff are very irresponsible They have damaged my bag and after I contacted them they promised me that I’ll recieve a new bag I’ve mentioned that my bag is big size and baggage service staff in Delhi  argued that my bag is of medium size and later when I sent measurements in the form of video and also the tag of my bag she agreed that it was a big bag, and finally sent me a bag which is of small size After complaining that it is a small size bag she kept on saying that it is impossible to give me a bag of the damaged bag and now none of the staff nor the complainant center is answering my calls I suggest not to travel through this airline Where staff are so irresponsible.

### "good way to not refund my money"
I booked online, on the Flydubai website. I had to cancel because of the pandemic, but they refuse to accept that I booked online, and continually tell me to contact my travel agent. It’s a good way to not refund my money. Ripped off!

### "misrepresented in false advertising"
flydubai sells tickets that it advertises as 'refundable'. Nowhere in its advertising does flydubai mention that by 'refundable' they mean that they will cancel the flight, then 'refund' you with their own vouchers, which you must use in a limited time. The word 'refundable' refers to *funds*, i.e., money, not to vouchers. Other airlines that 'refund' with vouchers make that clear in their advertising. Not flydubai though. They are arguing in their defense that the voucher policy is mentioned in their ToS. But this doesn't change the fact that it is misrepresented in their false advertising! You cannot lie in one place, then defend yourself by saying that you didn't lie in another place. A lie is a lie. To make things worse, the flight they canceled was one that they had no business selling, because they did not actually have government permission to operate it. They sold tickets on a phantom flight, then canceled the flight, and pocketed the money! A plain robbery.

### "not refunded the price difference"
My partner and I flew from Zanzibar to Dubai on FlyDubai in March 2020. (This review is late because I've given the airline every opportunity to rectify the issue; I'm only writing now that they've closed the case.) The desk attendant saw that we had business class tickets (for which we paid a fortune), then told us he would put us in separate seats in Economy unless we gave him $250. I told him that was robbery, but that I'd give him $100 to just give me back our seats  since we needed to make our connection. He accepted that offer and had another attendant accompany me out of the airport to the parking lot ATM where he demanded the money - I removed cash but refused to give him any until safely back inside. By this time, the first desk clerk had redoubled the price. The men then flipped their badges around so I couldn't see their names. When I told them I was calling the police, they gave us two economy seats and warned me that if the police actually came, they'd say I'd threatened them and I'd never make my flight. So we took our downgraded economy seats and left. I've been talking with FlyDubai for two months now. They do not care. They have not refunded the price difference for business class versus economy, and they have made no effort to find these men.

### "they will never help"
They are not helping at all if you need any inquiry that is matching already with their policy and not against it. If they replied they always have a negative reply and never helping to fix any problem. the last reply I got from them "your voucher for AED 900 is no more working (which expires in Sep 2020) and it was just a simple reply from their customer service supervisor" Don't take the risk and book with them if you face any problem they will never help even if they can easily do it.

### "they do not reimburse the money"
Not Verified |  I booked a round-trip flight from Shiraz to Dubai. They canceled the flight but they do not reimburse the money. After a long round of email exchange, they only promised to give us vouchers for future flights. This is very ridiculous. We have nothing in Dubai and we do not plan to visit Dubai at least in the next couple of years. Why should we be made to fly to Dubai instead of receiving the money back? They took the money while they have not provided any service for that.

### "worst travel experience"
Zanzibar to Dubai. The worst travel experience. Don’t refund money for cancelled flights which they cancelled. Don’t put you into another plane, leave you and don’t care. All they offer you is a voucher worth 70% of the original cost. Customer service is useless. Please do not spend your money on this airline. As they will leave you somewhere in the world and it will cost you triple money to get back.

### "worst traveling experience ever"
Kathmandu to Dubai. This is worst traveling experience ever. I have got all the documents but still fly Dubai staff didn’t board me in. I was supposed to depart on 20th but nobody can explain what was the issue.

### "lack of entertainment option"
Not Verified |  Kathmandu to Dubai with flydubai. Had to take this airline because of it's codeshare with my primary airline. It's a narrow body aircraft with only economy class configuration, so didn't expect a great deal of seating comfort. But the lack of entertainment option made it quite frustrating. Didn't even have a screen showing the general information. The food did not taste nice and, the cabin crew compared to other airlines were below standard. Could never get connected with the on board WiFi either.

### "very happy with the level of staff’s professionalism"
We travelled on a family vacation to Dubai and back two weeks ago. The trip was great, flying experience with Fly Dubai was especially wonderful because of the excellent customer service we received. We checked in two and a half hours early at the airport. Check in was smooth. Boarding commenced as per schedule and was systematically done. Cabin crew was courteous and warm. Inflight service was good too. We were seated on the 10th row, seat pitch was great and seats were very comfortable. Landing was 5 minutes early. We were carrying a DSLR Camera with us as it was a vacation trip. As we reached the arrival hall I suddenly realised we had forgotten the camera onboard. I instantly ran to the customer help desk in the arrival hall and informed him about the camera. The gentleman at the desk was spontaneous in response. He immediately called the security agent on-board and confirmed having it there. Staff coordinated with each other and got it arranged at the arrival hall in no time. We were very happy with the level of staff’s professionalism and efficiency. The trip was pleasant because it started at a great note. Flight back home was also great. We definitely recommend it to everyone!

### "never travel with Flydubai again"
Booked through Emirates and unfortunately did not check that the first length of our trip was with Flydubai from Helsinki to Dubai. The plane they use on this route is definitely not meant to keep you comfortable for a flight that takes 6-7 hours. The seats are uncomfortable, theres not enough space for your legs and arms and the overall feeling is just cramped and constricted. Felt like theres not enough room or air in the cabin. We had flex tickets so the meal was included. Food was ok, rather small portion with 1 dl of water to drink. For all the other drinks (even water) you had to pay separately. For the in flight entertainment you had to pay extra too. Didn't need any, my biggest problem was trying to shut the screen off. Quite a few of other passengers screens did not work at all. Cabin crew seemed to be in a lot of hurry and stress all the time, don't quite understand why, they only did 2 rounds of drinks. One of them was friendly and pleasant, the rest seemed almost rude. I can easily say I will never travel with Flydubai again. I'd rather stay at home.

### "Legroom comfortable"
Dubai to Zanzibar. Code share of Emirates and i was very upset when I saw the boarding pass of flydubai. Called the agent and he knew that the flight will be of flydubai. Its an average airline and i would rate 3 out of 5. Food decent and as per taste not very heavy for midnight meal. Legroom comfortable. Inflight screen not working which is a necessity for long journey.

### "not book more than necessary!"
Not Verified |  Bratislava to Dubai. It is a low-cost airline - you can also tell this from the leg distance. We have booked the "Flex" tariff so that we also have a meal on the flight from Bratislava to Dubai. To be honest, I can only advise against these additional costs, since the food delivered is neither of quality or quantity. In the plane we then tried to book the film package for cash - only the monitor was defective - the same thing happened again on the return flight. Online check-in works, but there are no online boarding cards - in other words, you are waiting at the check-in. My result : Airline is ok, but absolutely not book more than necessary. Es ist eine Billigfluglinie - dies merkt man ebenfalls am Beinabstand. Wir haben den "Flex" Tarif gebucht damit wir auch ein Essen am Flug von Bratislava nach Dubai haben. Ehrlich gesagt kann ich von diesen Mehrkosten nur abraten, da sich das gelieferte Essen absolut weder in der Qualität noch Menge den Kosten gegenübersteht. Im Flieger haben wir dann versucht das Filmpaket gegen Barzahlung zu buchen - nur war der Monitor defekt - am Rückflug das gleiche nochmals ... Online Check in funktioniert, aber es gibt keine Onlineboardingkarten - sprich man steht am Check In an ... Mein Resultat: Fluglinie ist ok, aber absolut nicht mehr buchen als irgendwie notwendig!

### "a wonderful journey with flydubai"
Yerevan to Dubai. It was a wonderful journey with flydubai. The have great legroom space for a person with a height of 5.8 ft tall. It was a great journey travelling with them. Aircraft looks relatively new and was kept really well. Seems like a new aircraft. Overall journey was great and my journey with them was very much satisfying and I definitely recommend flydubai to others. You need to experience it for yourself.

### "Very impressed with the service"
Not Verified |  Yerevan to Dubai with flydubai. Flew with my infant last week. I was standing in the queue for checking in my luggage and for collecting the boarding pass when the ground staff asked me to leave the queue and directly come to the counter because I was travelling with an infant alone. Really appreciate their way of dealing with people with special needs. Flight crew was also very helpful during the course of flight. Very impressed with the service.

### "Beware of this rogue airline"
flydubai cancelled this segment Bucharest to Dubai less than 14 days prior to leaving, offered a flight before or after which I could not take as I was transiting. They are claiming that I am not entitled to compensation, however under EC 261/2004, if the flight is cancelled less than 14 days before the flight is due to leave, I am entitled to a compensation of Euro 400. I am now awaiting their decision. I had to buy another one way for £350 ! Beware of this rogue airline, you will end up losing big.

### "this company was a total mistake"
Not Verified |  Bought a ticket through Emirates from Frankfurt to Zanzibar, which was partly operated from Dubai to Zanzibar by flydubai. Really long wait in the bus in front of the plane, unadebile food, no entertainment, mostly broken tv's, no legroom whatsoever, coffee 3$ and only credit cards accepted. For such an expensive ticket half way with this company was a total mistake. Never again.

### "submit a compensation claim"
. We got a flight delayed with over 24 hours due to a technical issue with the plane. I need to use a lawyer in order be able to get a compensation, because flydubai Customer Service doesn't even bother replying, let alone providing any useful information. We were supposed to fly on Flydubai flight FZ1758 departing on 27 December 2019 at 14:10 from Sofia Airport (SOF). Got to the airport 2 hours prior, checked in our bags, got to the gate, boarded the plane, spent an hour and a half on the plane, had to disembark the plane due to a technical issue, were told the plane was going to take off at 17:40, waited for two hours at the gate and could not get out for food or water because we were already "on the system". At around 18:00 we had to move to another gate because there was another flight scheduled on this one, moved to another gate just to be told that the plane was not going to fly today and we need to proceed to baggage claim. Got our bags, went back to the check-in desks, were told the flight's rescheduled for 5:30 the next morning (28 December 2019) but that's not final and we need to call later and confirm. Got back home at around 20:30, called to check at around 22:00, got told (quite rude) there's no new information, went to bed early as we planned to be at the airport at 3:30 in the morning. Woke up at around 1:30 a.m. to an SMS saying: "Please note that due to changes to our schedule your Flydubai flight FZ1758 departing on 27 December 2019 at 14:10 from Sofia Airport (SOF) to Dubai International Airport (DXB) has changed. You have been rebooked on flight FZ8758/1685 which departs Sofia Airport (SOF) on 28 December 2019 at 16:25 local time". Went back to sleep. On the 28 December 2019 got back to the airport 2 hours prior to the flight. Had to wait for about an hour at the check in desks in order to check in due to another technical issue with the system. Checked in, got to the gate, waited at the gate, 16:25 had come and gone but we were still at the gate, passengers got mad, staff didn't provide any information, emotions escalated, police got involved, emotions settled a bit, waited a bit more, finally boarded the plane and took off around 18:30, barely made it to our rebooked connection flight at Dubai Airport. Spent 6 lovely days in Zanzibar (should have been 7, but at least we made it there after all). On the way back Zanzibar - Dubai flight was fine, but Flydubai flight FZ1757 departing on 05 January at 09:35 from Dubai to Sofia was again delayed with about two and a half hours. Anyway, made it back home after all! I've tried to find a way to submit a compensation claim with Flydubai for the outbound flight fiasco. There's no information whatsoever regarding compensations on the website or anywhere else. Wrote to Customer Support anyways, to ask how can I receive my compensation. Sent an email on 6 Jan 2020. Got an automated response "Thanks for getting in touch. Our Customer Engagement Team will get back to you within 12 calendar days.". Guess what - I still haven't got an answer. Wrote to Customer Support on their Facebook page. Got the standard automated answer "Thank you for making us aware of your experience. We will get back to you with an update soon.

### "worst airline I have flown"
Dubai to Zagreb. This is the worst airline I have flown! Such a shame that we even didn't know we are not flying with Emirates. Tickets from Zagreb to Hanoi were partly cooperated with FlyDubai which has terrible food, no entertainment (tv screens didn't work at all! ), we needed to pay for everything on board. It wouldn't be a problem if flight would be short, but 7 hours without proper service - never again.

### "Shame on Emirates"
Not Verified |  A code share flight with Emirates and booking done with Emirates. During my journey to Barcelona from Yangon, half was by fly Dubai. We paid an Emirates fare, nevertheless when we flown with them no Emirates benefits were applied on the trip, since they only provided one cup of free water for a 7 hours trip, including the delay, food was awful. In flight entertaining system was zero. Shame on Emirates to choose a code low cost share Airline like FlyDubai.

### "it's a good airline"
Not Verified |  Delhi to Dubai. Flydubai is a good airline by all means. Ticket prices are always good, ground staff were kind and helpful. On board services like food quality is great and filling for a small journey but for long journey they should increase the quantity. I mean I felt hungry after sometime as it was a 4 hours flight. But yes it's a good airline.

### "all in all a nice trip"
Karachi to Dubai in August 2019. Food served was warm and in sufficient quantity. Attendants onboard were good, one of them was  very helpful with the change of seat as the recline button on my allotted seat wasn’t working on my inbound flight, Other than that there was no glitch. No flight delay, it was on time both the days so all in all a nice trip.

### "A great service"
Not Verified | I was travelling with my pregnant friend from Istanbul to Dubai. She had morning sickness and I am very happy with the way crew onboard took care of her throughout the flight. One of the crew members gave her briefing before take-off for a more comfortable flight. They kept checking on her after taking off as well. The crew also tried to calm her whenever she felt anxious. At the time of check-in and boarding also she was given priority which was nice. A great service.

### "Terrible experience with flydubai"
Bucharest to Dubai. Terrible experience with flydubai, we took off and flew for 20 minutes until the captain announced that the aircraft had technical issues and we were coming back to the same airport. The next day took off again with the same aircraft, flew for 10 minutes until turned around again. Not to mention the hours spent in the airport, moral damages, extra costs, lack of precise instructions and customer care etc. I will never fly again with this airline.

### "Service was at par"
Not Verified | Yerevan to Dubai. The reason is simple they have very reasonable rates for international destination. Service was at par. Even though nothing is great but still considerable against other budget airlines.

### "Great service"
Not Verified | Kathmandu to Dubai. Great service covering almost 90 destinations worldwide. In-flight services have always been up to the mark. Their new app is updated and great. I enjoying using flydubai.

### "food is horrible"
We have flown from Dubai to Zagreb and back. It is Emirates flight operated by flydubai. It is overpriced by 3 times. The plane was late on both flights, it is small, no space, no entertainment because screens are not working, food is horrible, AC is weak. This is embarrassment for Emirates. It is worst than any low budget flight I had so far. If you can, avoid this flight and take Turkish Airlines instead even if its more expensive. Worst experience ever.

### "always met my expectations"
Not Verified | Bahrain to Dubai. It's a very good budget airline for all short travel. I use it for all my short distance travel. Service has always met my expectations. I recommend to all my family anf friends for short distance journey

### "a good budget airline"
Colombo to Dubai. flydubai is a good budget airline. Legspace decent for a normal person. Food sufficient. Overall a good budget airline in all parameter. I recommend it for all budget travel to all my family and friends.

### "horror of the experience"
Dubai to Zagreb. Absolute disgrace of a company. The flight was more than 1 hour in delay in take-off, seating space is small, comfort is terrible, food is awful, entertainment screen is not working. Even if you pay for entertainment package there are no headphones. Price of the ticket is almost as the one from Emirates and quality is not even 10% of Emirates. Absolute horror of the experience. Avoid it if possible

### "If I could give 0 stars I would"
Not Verified |  I booked tickets for me and my family from Dubai to Prague months ago. 2 weeks before departure, I received emails that our flights will be shifted to Smartwings. To mention, that the same flight with Smartwings would have cost me half the price only if I would have booked direct with them even at a week before departure. Canceling flights is possible depending on the ticket, but will only be refunded in flydubai vouchers, which is useless for booking another airline instead at the same time. A complaint was not responded, even after several calls and emails. If I could give 0 stars I would.

### "had a backache for a week"
Tbilisi to Dubai. Tiny seats. Had to sit sideways for 3.5 hours, had a backache for a week. Arrival in Dubai to T2, the worst terminal. No metro there, not even an information desk. Very unfriendly for first time visitors. Flight was cheap, but not worth it for all the inconvenience.

### "fare value is great"
Mumbai to Dubai. It's a decent airline, fare value is great. It was a well maintained aircraft and everything went well. The food quality needs a little improvement. It was not bad but could have been better

### "I have no complaints at all"
Dubai to Zanzibar. I'm reviewing flydubai cause the aircraft I boarded was Flydubai. Service was at par with Emirates. Food delicious and inflight entertainment great. Overall it was a great journey and I have no complaints at all.

### "Really appreciate their effort"
Boarded the flight from Mumbai to Dubai. Seats on both flights were comfortable and aircrafts seemed in good condition. Crew especially was very good on both the sectors. Our 3 year old daughter had a cold on the outbound flight and while descending her ears start to hurting. Cabin crew brought her cookies and candy to ease the pain and also tried to distract her by entertaining her in different ways. Really appreciate their effort and it really meant a lot to us in terms of service. Will surely fly flydubai again.

### "performs so poorly at all levels"
We were travelling from Krakow to Bangkok with Emirates, and flydubai was the operator on the first part of the itinerary, from Krakow to Dubai. We chose this particular flight due to Emirates reputation, and good overall flight duration, due to only 2 hours between one connection and the other. With this being our first experience with flydubai, we were even more surprised to see that the aircraft which was meant for a nearly 6-hour travel has less legroom than low-cost and short-distance flight operators. Next disappointment came with a 40-minute delay in departure causing us a bit of anxiety of whether we will make it on time to our next flight. What came however as the worst part was related to the behaviour of some co-passengers. Several gentlemen sitting behind us obviously had had too much to drink and started acting loudly and would not respond to kind requests to enjoy the flight a bit more quietly. The staff would not only appreciate the remarks of co-passengers being potentially problematic, but continued to sell them alcohol and only at the end of the flight, advised those passengers not to drink anymore on their next flight. This obviously offered no solution to other passengers who had spent hours on board with little possibility to sleep, relax or simply enjoy the flight. Needless to say, due to later departure, we also had to move at high speed across the Dubai airport, and fortunately made it to catch our plane to Bangkok, but it caused us some unnecessary stress especially after a tiring flight. We are displeased to see Emirates partnering with a provider that performs so poorly at all levels, we will not travel with this company again and will discourage others to do so.

### "seat pitch was good"
Mumbai to Dubai. We picked flydubai for our travel and we don’t regret it. Aircraft was well-kept, seats were clean and seat pitch was good. The inflight crew was polite and our flight arrived in Dubai before time. We had a lovely experience.

### "avoid this airline"
Dubai to Hyderabad. Please avoid this airline. This is third class airline operating with Emirates name along with it. I am really not sure what is the connection with Emirates for this airline. It is very cheap in seats, food, staff behavior.

### "a great experience"
Dubai to Mumbai, a great experience. flydubai is a budget airline where you can get some really good deals when you book online. Have traveled couple of times this year. I am getting more comfortable with this airline as the cost is low. The aircraft of flydubai is not bad. The food was standard and ok. Customer support is good. I think flydubai is reliable and safe airline to travel.

### "Very happy with the service"
Flew from Hyderabad to Dubai last month. Service provided by the staff was good and I must applaud them for their effort. I was travelling with my elderly relative and it was a chockablock flight, I requested the staff to give us seats closer to the washroom as my father is a diabetic and needs to use the washroom frequently. Staff at the check-in counter did consider our request and we were provided with the appropriate seats. Also, crew on board was equally helpful throughout the flight. Very happy with the service.

### "attendants are helpful"
I took a night fight going home from Mumbai to Dubai. The flight attendants are helpful. I was unable to put my hand luggage on the above cabin as it was all full; the attendant standing nearby came immediately, made space for my bag and helped me put in. Food was decent as it was night flight so dinner was served and I was ok with the quality, could have been better but overall it was a good journey. I would recommend.

### "it went pretty well"
Mumbai to Dubai. Trying flydubai for the first time I had my doubts, but it went pretty well, the cabin crew team was professional and approachable. The food was good. The seats were wide enough and had enough legroom, there was a little turbulence on the way but the pilot managed to keep us posted at all times. My trip was not the most enjoyable trip ever but it got the job done and I recommend flydubai to other travelers.

### "experience was a good one"
Mumbai to Dubai. Good low-cost airline to fly with. My first experience with flydubai was a good one. The food was satisfactory and the seats adequate. The plane even took off and landed on time. The cabin crew were the highlight of the journey. They were very well-mannered and attentive in their service and made sure that all passengers, including myself, were attended to. Kudos to the flydubai flight crew!

### "Seats were comfortable"
Not Verified |  Salalah to Dubai. Travelling by air has become so convenient because of airlines like Flydubai at your service. Got a steal deal on the tickets. Check-in queue was a bit long. Crew on board was quite friendly. Seats were comfortable with enough leg space. Food can be pre booked or bought on the flight. Looking forward to another flight next week.

### "The seats were roomy."
Mumbai to Dubai. Good low-cost airline to fly with I had to change the dates of my flight so I called up the flydubai helpline. After providing the PNR, the representative was able to find the booking under my name and assist me. It took a few tries, but eventually, they changed the dates of my ticket for a nominal additional cost as I had purchased the Value Economy ticket Fast forward to the flight itself - it was good. The seats were roomy. Overall, it was far from the worst flight compared to some other low-cost airlines.

### "I won't use them again"
Dubai to Prague. I purchased a FlyDubai flex ticket as they are offering a refund option if you'd cancel the flight more then 24h in advance. On my way back i had to cancel the flight which i did within the time limit. First of all 30% of fee was retained, and the remaining amount of refunded to me in form of voucher which is only valid 6 months, cant' be transferred, can't be used on partner airline or can't be redeemed in miles. They advertise this flex ticket with these benefit in bold colored benefits and then write the limitions in small lost in the terms and conditions. The flight to go was late, the staff was unfriendly and they brought me a small vegetarian meal as that's all they had left (Meal meant to be included in the flex fare). I won't use them again.

### "Good customer service"
Not Verified |  Dubai to Muscat. Good customer service, information was clear. On board services was good. Lovely flight attendant with “at your service attitude”. It was a great journey for me. Looking forward for my next flight with flydubai.

### "worst flight in my life"
Not Verified |  Bahrain to Beirut via Dubai. That was the worst flight in my life. They delayed my flight from Bahrain to Dubai for 24 hours, I came back the next day they said there’s no booking under my name. I went to the office the manager said he cannot help. I called flydubai and spent more than 15 BD international calls. I had only 3 days leave from work and they ruined 2. They promised they will send an email for the next day booking but they did not. I went the third day and i was really lucky to travel after 2 days of wasting time and money on taxi and international calls. I sent a complaint but no reply. Never again with this company

### "Terrible website"
Prague to Hyderabad via Dubai. Terrible website that doesn't confirm properly. Terrible contact that doesn't send you SMS (Check if they did). Terrible email that goes straight to spam. Terrible customer service that's unreachable and replies within 20 days. Terrible banking policy that deducts money multiple days later and in the middle of the night without customer consent. Terrible customer policy that refunds in non-transferable vouchers.

### "forcing them to buy carry on luggage"
Dubai to Asghabat. The ground crew would not allow people with more than one bag at the gate and continue to make them wait for no reason. They would not accept passengers with plastic bags into the flight forcing them to buy carry on luggage from the duty free shop. Also at the end of the day they even allowed a large 30 inch luggage to fly on a seat - first time ever I’ve seen a luggage  on a seat. I was refused to board cause I had a carry on and a laptop bag, but I guess at the end of the day they checked in everyone who had a ticket - after pushing them around for more than 75 minutes and making the flight late for 35 minutes.

### "Horrible experience"
Sarajevo to Dubai. Horrible experience. Unexplained delays. Landed in a different country! No apologies, no courtesy, no information. No explanation from anyone on delays. Never again.

### "I was disappointed with the service"
Prague to Dubai. This is my second time on flydubai and I was disappointed with the service. Flight attendants were so confused and lost. Screens were not working, and there was not a main big screen where you can check the current location of where you are. Food was ok. It was a light meal as it should be and the seats were pretty wide, although they could have been much softer. I do not know what happened, but my flight in 2016 was much more enjoyable.

### "feels really cheap"
Bucharest to Dubai. This airline has seemingly nothing to do with Emirates (that they proudly advertise) other than the check-in and gate. The aircraft is uncomfortable, no entertainment (no screen) or if they do needs payment. No water, no snacks - feels really cheap, like squeezing pennies anywhere they can - they don't get to go to the terminal, you are hauled to the aircraft with a bus. The staff was nice though, no complains about that.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Dubai to Sofia. Was upgraded to Business class because plane was full. Seat was nice and roomy, footrest did extend but it did not raise up, so not a leg-rest. You get automatic access to all the movies and in-flight entertainment, along with a pretty good pair of noise-cancelling headphones. Seat back went back quite far without interfering with person behind. Wifi I think is also included (didn't use it). The food was not much better than economy, but served nicely, and you got a lot of juice and water if you wanted it. Small bottle of water was also in the armrest when we arrived. There were pillows and a fleece blanket provided. Service was very good up front - nice flight attendants. Only minus is that, because the front door is open to let passengers in, business class gets extremely hot sitting on the tarmac in summer conditions at Dubai airport - bring a fan to cool yourself before take off. For a budget airline, I was pleasantly surprised at the good quality of the business class flight, but not sure if I'd actually pay for it.

### "Never flying FlyDubai again"
Dubai to Naples. So disappointed with the customer service of Fly Dubai. They cancelled our return flight and didn’t inform us - only found out on the day of the first flight. Now they are only offering us a flight on a different date or a refund which both are not an option for us because we have to fly on that day and the one way flights have now doubled in price. 10 phone calls later and still not a reasonable compensation. First 2 days of holiday ruined because of the stress and endless conversations on the phone and empty promises. Never flying FlyDubai again! Also the plane was not cleaned before we entered, when I opened the window I couldn’t look through the glass because of the grease, was offered a wet tissue to clean it myself which was given 15 min later. Also the floor was full with chips and other crumbs, the screens didn’t work and this is not mentioning the disappointing food items they serve. Will pay that little bit extra next time to avoid this drama.

### "The worst flight ever"
Dubai to Kuwait. The worst flight ever, I will never fly with fly Dubai ever again, they made us wait on the bus right outside the aircraft for half an hour in this heat, the AC wasn’t working on the bus either. If the aircraft is not ready for boarding what is the point getting people to the bus!

### "was pleasantly surprised"
Kathmandu to Dubai in Business class. I was pleasantly surprised with how the chief purser was courteous and kind to all passengers, including my elderly parents. He offered to stow their luggage for them without them asking. The IFE was good with good range of movies to watch on this flight. Wifi was decently priced. I was able to use the inflight charging ports. We were offered a hot meal which was filling and good quality. Snacks were offered prior to arrival. disembarked via a bus and was out in no time! can't fault this airline! Well done Flydubai for providing a good product at a competitive price! I hope they bring back the 737MAX back soon with the flat beds in J class!

### "dissapointed with this airline"
Dubai to Moscow. Get a seat with extra space for legs in the front part of cabin. Crew member decided to swap passenger who suppose to seat next to me, for lady with very young kid, (like 2-3 months old) who was screaming and crying all the time. When I asked to change my seat for similar or better cause baby was horribly annoying and there were few empty seats in front of me and around the cabin. Crew member looked at me like at piece of junk and said no. Thats rude, I am dissapointed with this airline.

### "Stay away from this airline"
Not Verified |  Mumbai to Moscow via Dubai. They lost our baby stroller at the very beginning of a 15 days trip, then returned it to us around the 8th or 9th day with 2 wheels of 4 missing. All efforts to put sense into them failed and eventually we were handed USD50 for a USD100 stroller that was now useless and nothing for our plight of not being able to use a stroller for 15 days. Stay away from this airline.

### "the worst airline"
Bahrain to Mumbai via Dubai. Flydubai is the worst airline company. Their staff is rude, flights are late and they cheat their passengers for excess baggage purchase by charging 2.5 times more than their written policy.

### "my baggage are missing"
My wife was traveling from Abha to Faisalabad via Dubai. No one inform me that Sialkot airport is closed when I reached airport they told that my destination divert to Faisalabad. We have no option. My wife was traveling alone and she was landed about 300 km from her hometown at mid night. After that I heard a news that my baggage are missing. She complaint at the airport. There is no complaint mechanism and tracking for that to find the things. I am worried about that these things will be stolen/ missing. I sent them email, call at dubai and use every channel but till now I didnt find any information/ response from them.

### "they charge for water"
Dubai to Muscat. Short 40-min flight from Dubai to Muscat. Departure and arrival on time. Check-in swift. Departure from DXB Terminal 2 is a nuisance though since it is not connected to the metro and can only be reached from Terminal 3 by a 45-min (!) taxi ride during the traffic rush hour. Very narrow seating, but it is a budget airline after all. Still I find it outrageous that they charge for water in the evening after a Ramadan day with temperatures reaching the lower 40s (C) outside.

### "avoid it as long as you can"
Not Verified |  Helsinki to Kathmandu via Dubai. If you want to experience what is ultimate cheap experience on Airline, fly Fly Dubai! The aircraft's seating configuration are very narrow, tight and extremely low leg room. They don't even have the pouch on the seat to hold things, as such to make room big enough for passengers. Cramped seats  Inflight entertainment never worked on any of the aircraft. Food is as basic and as little as possible in a paper box. Airport in Dubai for Transit (Terminal T2), it took 2 transfers and 45 min bus ride within the airport to reach the terminal. Fly Dubai even makes you take the very cheap and no facility Dubai's Airport terminal/section. Overall, only fly if no option and for a very short flight. Otherwise, avoid it as long as you can!

### "never fly with this airline again"
Dubai to Bucharest. Worst aviation experience I have ever had. Almost two hours delay, staff is not able to provide information. Airplane entertainment does not work. I will for sure never fly with this airline again.

### "worst ever experience"
Helsinki to Kabul via Dubai. It was the worst ever experience with flydubai. I paid 830 euros for ticket. When I was flying back to Finland from Kabul they didn't serve any meal when the flight duration was around 3 hours, I was fine with that but after 6hr and 45 mints of layover in Dubai airport they even did not serve any food on flight. My flight from Dubai to Helsinki was for more than 6hrs - they were charging for food and snacks. Everyone had to pay for food.

### "now it is terrible"
Not Verified |  Bucharest to Dubai. I booked a fully flexible ticket on Flydubai that comes with checked in baggage but needed to change my flight on the return to come back a day later. I did this online and it said everything was fine and I could change for free so I did it. Then I arrive at the airport and the check in person tells me I didn't book baggage so I showed her my original ticket that said I booked fully flexible with baggage. Then she told me that when you change your booking it becomes the cheapest booking and you lose all your perks like baggage. How is it then fully flexible? I had to pay $120 for my checked bag because of this. That is not flexible. Terrible service. Used to be a good airline but now it is terrible.

### "last flight ever with flydubai"
Baku to Karachi via Dubai. Worst flight ever even more than worst. I had my flight at 28 march 7:00 pm, i reached Baku airport at 3, I asked the fly dubai counter any they told me that check In will start at 5:00pm, when I came their at 5:00 they told me your flight is canceled and your next flight will be at 3:30am. I was shocked because I had no where to till that. Some how I got my flight at 3:30 (remember that 3:30am should be the arrival time of Karachi as per ticket). This flight fuel got empty and we waited on the airplane for four hours and then at 11:30 am i reached Dubai where I got to know that my flight from Dubai to Karachi will be at 9:00 pm. I am now at the airport with my wife in complete shock. Iam tired af, as them to please accommodate us some where we can rest as we are traveling for more the. 20 hours and we have to wait another 12 hours, so what they did was sorry and said please have a meal, I mean how I am supposed to have a meal when I am asking for hotel. Really pathetic airline it is. First and of course the last flight ever with flydubai.

### "staff is non polite"
Dubai to Kathmandu. Ground staff is non polite of flydubai airlines. Boarding staff are totally nonsense not polite In Dubai airport terminal 3, I do not recommend to Use this.

### "Impolite staff"
Dubai to Istanbul. If you want to have the worst flight just go with flydubai. Irresponsible company. Impolite staff. I had 4 times flight with this company and in all cases we had a problem. First time from Yerevan to Dubai flight has been cancelled and no one informed us and we went to airport and found out the flight is canceled and postponed to tomorrow. The next time from Dubai to Istanbul flight cancelled when we were onboard. They didn't explain and 20:45 flight changed to the next day at 7 am. During this time they didn't provide any hotel and no place to rest just simple food from KFC that is was limited to some options. The staff lied us and didn't care at all.

### "probably the worst we have taken"
Not Verified |  We had booked a return flight with Emirates, from Glasgow to Zanzibar via Dubai on 27th February and returning on 7th March. After confirming our booking, we found that the 6 hour leg from Dubai to Zanzibar is operated by FlyDubai, which turns out to be a low cost (but not particularly cheap) airline. The Emirates flights to and from Glasgow to Dubai on a 777-300 were excellent in all respects but we can honestly say that in all our years of travelling, the FlyDubai flights in a Boeing 737-800MAX were probably the worst we have ever taken. By booking with Emirates, we not unreasonably expected to get at least a roughly comparable standard of service and amenities. We believe that Emirates should make it clearer when booking that an associated connecting flight is operated by a budget airline, and a poor one at that. There were so many things wrong that it’s difficult to know where to start but here goes: The seats were really very cramped, with a nominal pitch of 30” but I suspect that in reality it’s a bit less than this. Furthermore, the seats were quite hard and our backsides started to suffer after a couple of hours. They’ve tried to cram in as many passengers as possible and whilst this may be just bearable for short haul flights, it’s a disgrace to use this configuration for what was a long haul flight. It was obvious that many passengers, and more especially the taller ones, were really suffering. The aisle was very narrow, and passengers in aisle seats were being constantly bumped into while trying to sleep. The cabin on both the outbound and return flights was terribly stuffy and airless. Air con was either not working properly, or not set up correctly. People were asking for water but had to pay for it! Absolutely disgraceful! As we were on an Emirates ticket, we were entitled to complimentary meals, but other passengers had to pay. The meals were truly awful and pretty much inedible. In flight entertainment is available but has to be paid for, even for those on an Emirates ticket. FlyDubai operates from Terminal 2 which entails a painfully slow 40 minute bus transfer from Terminal 3 – this is pretty nail-biting if you have a tight connection, as we did. All in all, a horrible experience that we never wish to repeat and we can categorically state that we will never use FlyDubai again, and nor will we book with Emirates if they use them for connecting flights. There are better alternatives.

### "a learning experience"
Delhi to Dubai. My third visit to Dubai but I had my worse experience with Flydubai as they charged me with 1000 bucks for check in package,they told me only 7kg bag allowed in your booking and if you want to check in then pay 1k for 10kg bag. I think it's obvious people have check in bags, As a student paying 1000 extra hurts me, why didn't they tell me or displayed any options for check-in baggage but nothing you can do so let it be, it was a learning experience I will be careful about the that in future and will avoid Flydubai.

### "they are really really bad now"
Muscat to Dubai. We checked in for our flight and downloaded my boarding pass. When I got to the airport I was told I had no seat as the system has failed and I was not cheeked in. This was at the gate, after I passed all security checks. Had to wait as all the other passengers for on board, then they decided to help us. By which point the were only 2 seats at the back of the plane, middle seats, different rows. When I tried to complain, the on board staff were totally unconcerned. They were not rude, but could not care less about the fact that they had messed up my seats. After getting in board I noticed my boarding pass had a totally different name. They had no AC and it was like an oven on board. Staff liked miserable and ready to die. If you ever think you might fly this airline, don't. Check Emirates as they are cheaper after to add the fees for a seat and a bag on FlyDubai. Disappointing as I have been flying on FlyDubai for years, but something has changed and they are really really bad now.

### "rude and inappropriate manner"
Dubai to Tbilisi. The person who checked us in was very good person. He asked our documents he even verify our visa validity which helps us a lot not to get in any confusions or chances not to enter the country. He gave our boarding pass and help us to check in the luggage. After that we enter with the security check walk around the duty free shops. Then our boarding was started. Before we approach to the counter for the boarding one gentle man came and suddenly started asking us too many questions and in very rude manner. Even though we have our all proper required documents for travel he started investigating us asking a questions like how many money we have, NOC from the company. Lots of the people no body were asked any questions and we were amazed that in a very rude and inappropriate manner we were told to come to side and started asking questions. It was not less than a police officer investigating a criminal. One of the guy was the one who took us at the side and give our documents to the other guy and then that guy gave our documents to the other guy and they were asking the same question. We are going on a vacation and they ruined our whole mood. At the end they took a pictures of our passport and let us go. They were very smart that they hide the front side of their employee id to make sure that nobody knows their name. Crew member were good and even the guy at the front who checked us in. But those who were at the place at the boarding time were very rude.

### "disappointed about their service"
Kochi to Khartoum via Dubai. The airlines charged us for the meal for myself and my family and didn't deliver in the aircraft. They didn't respond the complaint for 2 months even after several follow up, seems they don't care at all, lately we received the voucher for the amount under the travellers name after 3 months of complain and follow up for the discount on next travel within six month validity for each inviduals who didnt get their meal. The voucher could be only used for ticketing in 6 months. I was disappointed about their service, they just dont know what they doing in the name of budjet air.

### "the flight will be late"
Kiev to Dubai. I fly by Flydubai very often and always having same issue with them. This airlines never depart on time and arrive on time, at least an hour the flight will be late. Also I bought flexible tickets to be able to change the date as per flex ticket which cost much more I would not need to pay penalty. And when I call the call center to change my ticket to another date they charge me 250AED. I do not understand what kind of flex ticket is that and why I paid for it.

### "do not recommend this airline"
Dubai to Helsinki. Fly Dubai is the most disoriented international airline I ever boarded for long distance. First of all they boast themselves as low cost airline and charge higher along with same airfare category as emirates or other skytrax airlines. Second for some reason they selectively pick the cabin bag without weighing and ask them to be checked in (I just had a bag with laptop and because of there sharp weighing mechanisms I had my laptop flying around in the airplane because they had problems check-ing in 6 kg of cabin allowance that I already paid) The waiting halls are small and the bus stranded for 20 mins near the plane adding salt to my wounds I selected it since it is controlled by Emirates but it is the worse and no where near it. I do not recommend this airline.

### "bags did not arrive"
Dubai to Ashagat. Now airplanes of this company become very old and passenger cabin is not maintained well. Most of the entertainment screens in economy class are not functional. Some of the seat's cover were damaged and one seat was completely damaged itself. On arrival to Ashgabat some about 30 people realized that their bags did not arrive and was left in Dubai airport, all of these people had only one or two backs. While there was a lot of boxes with commercial cargo arrived on our flight. There was no representative from flydubai and no one told when my back is going to be delivered to Ashgabat. It is already 10 days and I did not receive any information about my luggage.

### "will continue to travel with FlyDubai"
I only have praise for the flight attendants on this flight from Dubai to Kabul, they were incredibly professional with some very challenging passengers to assist. These flight attendants met those challenges amazingly, they were well presented and incredibly polite. Whilst I was only traveling in economy I felt I’d been upgraded. One particular flight attendant could not have been any more helpful and charming, she is a credit to flyDubai. Their recruitment staff you’re selection process clearly works I will continue to travel with FlyDubai.

### "their service is abysmal"
Dubai to Belgrade. They charge ticket prices at premium level as if they are premium airline, however, their service is abysmal if you do not consider them a low-cost flying company. Everything costs extra, date change, cancellation, food and beverage, entertainment, check-in luggage over 15kg, even seats at the exit aisle. Service of their staff is also abysmal. If you do not have to fly this company you will save tons of money

### "should offer the basic facilities"
Dubai to Colombo. I was traveling Back to Colombo and I was on an Emirates ticket. This was a budget Airline. I believe if FlyDubai is offering CodeShare with a Premium flight, at least they should offer the basic facilities of the Premium Flight. Although I was served with a main meal, all others such was at a cost. I refused the main meal simply as, me and the passenger next to me was served, but the other passenger in the same row was not served a meal. This made it uncomfortable for me to have meals next to a person (in the same row) who was not even served a glass of water. This is purely discrimination practiced by many budget Airlines (not only FLYDubai but some of the other Budget Airlines too). - Entertainment was also optional at a cost although I had an Emirates ticket. Baggage allowance was 20kg against 30kg offered by Emirates (However I must confess that this did not come by surprise as it was declared before). At the check-in counter I wanted a fragile sticker in by baggage but I was told that FLYDUBAI does not have fragile stickers and the baggage to be dropped at the Oversized baggage counter where I have to stand behind another queue. - In the online checking section the Meals option was only for Vegetarian and a Moslem Meal (I was not sure what was this meal as it did not have any description).

### "take this airline again"
Dubai to Baku. I hadn't flown FZ since 3 or 4 years but I was impressed by the overall experience. We left on time, staff were very polite, the aircraft recent with leg space and more comfortable seats than the older versions. Flight was very smooth and the landing perfect. I went to Baku and came back the next day. The aircraft was delayed from Dubai 40 mins but the captain apologised and said he would try and catch up on route. The aircraft was 7 years old and my screen wasn't working, I asked the woman next me if we could display the flight info and that was fine. Flight also very smooth and great approach and landing. Will take this airline again.

### "small area with no benefits"
Amman to Dubai. I paid extra fees to sit on the first line to get extra legroom. But it was small area with no benefits. The cabin crew also was tough, there was no space for our hand luggage. No monitors in the flight. Beverages menu the same since flydubai starts.

### "Worst flying experience ever"
Entebbe to Dubai. Worst flying experience ever. My flight was five and a half hours. All the TVs around mine were broken but the screens stayed on and they generated a lot of heat. The air conditioning barely worked. The back of the plane had AC and TVs. It was incredibly dry and we couldn’t have more water aside from the 125 ml served with the small meal. There was essentially no safety briefing and the pamphlet had no words so you had to  guess what the pictures mean. All announcements before the last 15 minutes were spoken by someone whose English was very poor, seriously hard to understand. The ride sucked.

### "I would recommend to avoid"
Not Verified |  Dubai to Prague. Terminal 2 at Dubai - where FlyDubai fly in and out of - is one big cramped hall, with a couple of toilets and a couple of duty free shops. If your layover here is more than 2 hours then I would recommend taking the transfer bus to terminal 3 and enjoying the space there. Positives: The plane was on time. It was a new plane. Boarding staff were very professional. They got me from A to B. Negatives: Leg-room was very limited and the seats were very narrow. When I checked in online I was shown another passengers details and I feel this must have been the reason why I was provided with a free meal, which was inedible. The plane was overheated and the screen didn't work. Overall, I would recommend flying with a standard airline. FlyDubai are a discount airline with standard prices. I would recommend to avoid.

### "impossible to contact them"
Dubai to Khartoum morning 16 August 2018. Arrived to DXB the previous evening from T1 and had to move by busses to T2 to get BP. Terrible mess and nightmare to queue up in T2 – completely disorganised with no signage and information. A goat-market of dimensions. Most check-in staff incompetent and could not find peoples bookings resulting in many hefty discussions (people almost fighting) for the whole transit hall. Eventually I was granted to pass the 2nd security and enter their Lounge in T2 which is far below standard to all the lounges in T1. Spent almost 4 hours from arrival before entering the lounge – and still without BP as my “booking did not exist”!? They brought it 3 a.m. by courier to the lounge, though. No recognition nor prioritisation of business class customers in the entire T2. Only the lounge gives a small advantage (have champagne and beer), though it is not impressive and food are lousy. While onboard the B737 the business class cabin turned out to differ from economy and was decent with large seats and free services, inc. take-off champagne. 2 hot-meals were offered, both of very mediocre quality. When descending for Khartoum the KRT airport was suddenly announced closed due to a crash on the runway. Thus, we were diverted back to Port Sudan where we were halted on the runway for 2 hours. The ground mess will make me think twice to struggle with this airline again. Was given Miles to my Skywards account as Flydubai recently fully integrated their FFP programme with Emirates. Major drawback is luggage: I was guaranteed from DXB that both pieces were identified and loaded. However, 1 piece did never arrive in KRT and was obviously not loaded. Could not access any Lost Luggage counter and could neither get PIR report not contact Flydubai as their emails bounches. De facto had to forsake 1 piece of luggage due to they lied to me and impossible to contact them. KRT airport became closed due to an airplane crash in the runways. Thus we had to go back and down in Port Sudan and wait together with other airlines for some 3 hours on the tarmac before travel was resumes. Lost my connection in KRT.

### "Staff were rude, insensitive"
Khartoum to Dubai. I have just stepped off a Fky Dubai flight which was delayed from Khartoum to Dubai by over 3 hours. Delay is acceptable - it happens but how an airline deals with the situation is critical. I was traveling alone and was assisting a fellow traveller who was travelling with a baby (3 months) and a 1 year 9 month old toddler who was asleep when we arrived and they had missed a connection flight to Oslo. The mother had handed over her pushchair before boarding the plane at Khartoum and despite knowing that our flight was 3 hrs late and many travellers had transit they were not prepared to deal with tired and anxious passengers. I asked for a pushchair and was ignored by several staff. Staff were rude, insensitive and had an attitude with all the confused passengers. They had no information and when I told them the woman couldn’t speak English and I am actually entering Dubai, I was simply told by a manager to “just go into Dubai”! The staff where just as rude as the manager. After holding this sleeping baby for an hr and being delayed over 4 hrs to enter Dubai and go to work, they came with a pushchair that was in the back!! Delays happen but it’s not fly Dubai staff have to accept that passengers are unhappy and assist them. This is what customer service is about. I have vowed to never travel with fly Dubai with my children as this experience has shown me that they are insensitive to passengers with Children.

### "experience was very bad"
Dubai to Bahrain. My experience was very bad. Flight FZ025 was scheduled at 14:25. Passengers rode the bus at 14:35 and the bus did not move for more than 1/2 hour. It was hot and AC was bad and I have 2 degenerative slipped discs and Rotator Cuff injury in shoulder that I could not stay standing that long. The bus moved to the plane and by the plane Fly Dubai mad us stay in the Bus for approximately another 40 minutes. Eventually. we got into the plane and the plane started taxiing at about 15:50 when it stopped for another 25 minutes until it departed at 16:15. This is not how to treat passengers. No respect, no consideration. The least Fly Dubai could do is to leave the passengers stay at the airport hall until their plane is ready to move and not to leave after 2 hours! I reached Bahrain with massive backache and shoulder pain.

### "the worst airline"
Astana to Dubai. Flydubai is the worst airline I ever experienced, starting from uncomfortable seats, finishing with terrible service. I had international flight from Astana to Dubai, UAE with my family at 4.30 am. I faced was delay of the boarding time on 40 minutes, what later on lead delay of departure time on 20 minutes. I had sit number 14C, unfortunately it was next to emergency exit, and as they explained me on a board such seats are not designed for changing position, what means 5 hours I had to sit and not have opportunity to have even little nap, I think such details should be mentioned somewhere before, including that people in front of me could change positions and lay, what made trip even more uncomfortable. Then tv on a back of chair I could turn it on and off only with help of not very friendly personal, staff explained it to me as “it is not as sensitive as your phone” I’m sorry, but there was zero response how ever hard I tried to chose something on the screen. You have to pay for watching tv, playing games or watching movies separately? When I asked staff for water for me and for my family, she told me that there not enough water for free for all passengers, but we can buy water for 10 dirham each bottle if we are thirsty. For my coming back from Dubai to Astana, 50 people had to stand in a one bus and waiting I don’t know what for, but have been there for 30 minuets! Again flight was delayed! And those hours passengers had to wait not in a terminal with Air Conditioner and WiFi, but suffer in a terrible conditions.

### "it is always late"
Kiev to Dubai. Staff are far from friendly, seat spacing is too narrow and the worst of all it is always late. I've been using this airline since launch and nothing has changed.

### "really isn’t worth it"
Kuwait to Dubai. Extremely poorly skilled staff. No courtesy towards sick passengers. Asked for water and was denied. And when asked why I was told it was company policy. Very disappointed. No matter how cheap the ticket is. Please do not travel by this airlines. It really isn’t worth it.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Dubai to Beirut. Worst experience ever. We had to wait on the bus for 40 mins with poor AC with outside temperature around 50 degrees Celsius. After we boarded the flight, the AC was still very poor and the flight got delayed. Bottom line, be ready to sweat and have an extra t-shirt on board.

### "one of the worst flights"
Dubai to Amman. It was one of the worst flights in my life. I used a lot of airlines. But this was the worst in cleanliness, entertainment, staff cooperation and specially leg space. Also it is not cheap comparing with other airlines once you add food, luggage and entertainment on your ticket. I will never travel with such airlines

### "angry and disappointed"
Dubai to Bucharest. I have never been so angry and disappointed with an airline. This is unacceptable and ridiculous really to the point of being offensive. Our plane had a ‘technical issue’ or flight was programmed to leave at 10:30 am. After 3 hours delayed they sent us back to the terminal. They told us to wait until 3:30 pm. We boarded again, the same plane. And guess what! ‘technical issue’. Completely ridiculous. Now we are getting back to the airport again

### "Leg space was good"
Dubai to Muscat. I travelled on Economy class. We were made to wait for approximately 15 minutes in the bus once we reached near the flight. That was quite tough and in a crowded bus. It seems they haven't finished the cleaning process. They could have started boarding after that. Now once inside due to the long waiting asked for a cup of water but never given. So left it. Had to wait till they start the service. Not just my case but was for my near seat passengers also. Flight was clean and well arranged. No entertainment system available for this flight. End of the day it was a short trip. Leg space was good in this configuration.

### "cabin crew laziness"
Dubai to Bratislava. I only choose this airline because of affordable fare. I don't mind that they don't deliver free service on-board, you have to buy on-board. Fair enough, I always bring some snacks or sandwich, and buy on-board coffee. At the end of the day, I need to go from A to B, not to eat on-board. I only asked for a small pillow for my little one as she was tired. I noticed cabin crew giving pillow to other passengers. So I asked for one. Cabin crew without saying anything, threw on me duty free magazine saying I need to purchase blanket and a pillow for 90 aed. I went to the toilet, and I see both cabin crew lying down on the 3 seats covered with a blanket and sleeping. Honestly, I wanted to ask her if she purchased the blanket. OK, they started sale on-board, when suddenly turbulence occurred. They left with the carts, turbulence stopped but they never returned. My little one went by herself to the galley to buy a sprite. Honestly, I'm aware they are low cost but cabin crew behavior is the worst. Sleeping on the seats while on duty and front of all passengers - waking up with messy hair, wrinkled skirts and blouse. Not sure if the company monitors cabin crew performance and looks. Same thing happened of first sector, cabin crew sleeping on the seats. Honestly, I am a frequent flyer with this airline only because of affordable price but mostly because they fly directly to my country (only one from Dubai). Flight was on time, I cannot complain but the cabin crew laziness, carelessness, rude approach is the worst.

### "Expensive with poor facilities"
The aircraft from Alexandria to Dubai seemed to be new. toilets on that aircraft are shockingly small compared to the other aircraft with the same type. You cannot even move in the toilets unless all your clothes wipe the walls, toilet bowl and the bin stowage. As Flydubai’s toilets always have wet floors and shelfs, they must enlarge the toilets and ensure that their crew maintain the cleanliness of the toilets. The internet did not work and was rejecting my payment method which I used every time and there was not any actual reason for their system to reject my payment other than an unacceptable error. There was not enterainment system installed. Expensive tickets with poor facilities.

### "would not recommend"
Dubai to Entebbe. Seats were uncomfortable. The flight was not full when asked to sit in empty seats was told have to pay $200 to switch seats in same cabin. Worst customer service from flight attendant my son asked for head phone and the attendant never came back to us. Seems ignorant customer service. One thing for sure would not recommend this airline to anyone even it is cheap.

### "simple and elegant concept"
Khartoum to Dubai in a newish B737-800 aircraft in good condition and with fresh interior in bright colours. The business class section was 4 rows in a 2-2 configuration. Only 4 passengers in business made high level attendance from 2 FAs committed to business class. The separation to economy class was made by blue, semi-transparent plexi-glass which is the most elegant solution I have seen for this separation. Further, a rope prevented economy class passengers to encroach the business section. Flight was one hour delayed but not a big issue as I had 3 hours transit in DXB anyway. Lounge access granted in Khartoum to a modest, 3rd party, alcohol-deserted lounge used mainly by Emirates. My first time with Flydubai. When in business it almost appears to be a legacy carrier. Got the ticket during a campaign (FZ and CZ combined) for a fraction of the price of an economy class ticket. KRT is not an easy airport for transfers. They have very, very few transit passengers and there are no routines or clear modality for transitors apart from getting personal attention from officers who instantly seize your passport and let you wait clueless for hours. Onboard, FAs were very communicative and professional. One staff attendant came from Qatar Airways and claimed to be much happier with Flydubai. Food very tasty and 3 options of hot food given. I had all options and they were all very good and presented in a simpler way than for 5 star airlines – but that suited me well – simple and elegant concept. Drinks were of limited choices but good – inc. champagne and decent wines (only 2 wine options). Arrived at the remote Terminal 2 in Dubai but was transferred quickly to the main Terminal 1 for transit. IFE easy to operate with large touch screens. For the money spent (promotional ticket) I can only rate the experience as 10/10 minus 1 for the delay (though it did not affect me).

### "delayed because of a sandstorm"
I flew from DXB to BAH via FZ023. Flight was due to depart at 7.15am UAE time. Flight got delayed because of a sandstorm. Unfortunately, there was no announcement from the flight crew explaining or apologizing for the delay. Landed in Bahrain without any other events. Cabin Crew were very helpful with passengers finding extra space for the carry-on bags.

### "I felt totally deceived"
A few days ago, I was flying from Prague to Singapore via Dubai and I purposefully chose to fly with Emirates to try a new carrier on that route as it was recommended to me by a friend who had a great experience with them in the past. However, on the day of the flight, I was unpleasantly surprised to find out that the 5.5hr flight from PRG to DXB both ways was serviced by flydubai. As the flight number was starting with EK like all Emirates flights do, and as I did not see any warning about it while purchasing the ticket online, I automatically assumed the whole trip would be with Emirates. Oh boy was I shocked when I found out - I felt totally deceived! And to clarify, I had 3 other options I could have chosen from in the same price category and flight time for that route, but I chose this "Emirates" one to give it a try (as I have flown the same route before with Turkish, Qatar, Lufthansa/SIA) - so yes, the excuse by flydubai for all their mediocre and below standard service as their "efforts to keep prices low" is just completely wrong - it's not cheap at all. And on a side note, a lady I met in Dubai that was taking the same flight back with flydubai felt exactly the same way and said she would never fly with them again and that she also did not know it was going to be with them either - she was outraged. So, what was the flight like? A complete dread and discomfort, which I would certainly not expect for such a long flight. If it was 1-1.5 hour flight, it would be perhaps acceptable, but certainly not for this long flights - I am shocked that they are not banned from operating such long flights given that they are simply not suited for them. In short, there was much lesser legroom and smaller seats compared to the Emirates ones, no food or drinks provided on the whole trip (unless for a few exceptions - I was one of them and I received a 1.5dl of water in a plastic box and a veggie lasagne and that was it - and it's not like I couldn't have bought something from their onboard shop - the thing is that I was so disgruntled with their services that I did not want to contribute them any more money. And btw I would much rather pay those few extra bucks at the point of buying the ticket for the comfort of having everything included in the price - again, I felt like I was cheated once more, because I do expect much better services on long flights). All the entertainment was paid (again, I would much rather pay those few bucks beforehand to have it included) and no wifi. It was all just a pain. Another huge downside about the experience was the flydubai's distant and extremely low quality terminal 2 in Dubai, where all their flights fly from. Not only that it took 45mins to get to the main Emirates terminal on my way to SG, but it also did not feel safe and the service was really bad - we took some shabby buses that seemed to be for workers at the airport and the drivers were not too compelled to work and to drive us there, so it took another 20mins just waiting on them. Also, on my way back, I was looking forward to doing some last-minute souvenir shopping for my family in the modern part of the airport - and nope, that part of the airport was not possible to access if you were leaving from T2, so I went directly there and it was just bad - one large dirty hallway, and small duty free. Never again - not them, nor Emirates - for the fear that part of the flight would be with flydubai again.

### "Bad planning and bad systems"
Dubai to Baku. Poor online booking and check-in experience. Online Card Payment process for mastercard failed and customer service wanted me to go to a machine to pay by cash. Card processing retried and worked with Visa. But had to ring again to get email ticket receipt. Queues at airport at 10.30 am were growing clearly because of insufficient staff planning for checkin desks. Fast bag drop took over 30mins. At one point queue of over 30 people and only 1 person on desks. 1.5 hours before flight time. Fast bag drop process seems very slow. Bad planning and bad systems.

### "below the standard"
Dubai to Bishkek. This flight with flydubai was really below the standard of a typical budget airline. As a budget airline, I expected the seats and terminal to be cramped, no PTV or any entertainment, service, food or beverages. These are expected from an low rated budget airlines such as flydubai. However, the problem was that the crews were extremely unfriendly and could not even be bothered to help passengers to put away the carry-on bags on the overhead compartments. There were a lot of elderly passengers and those with children who really needed assistance from the crew. Instead the crew just chatted among themselves while they watched the fare paying customers struggled with their bags. The chatting continued for the entire flight - only briefly interrupted by the safety demonstration. The minute the safety demonstration was completed, the chatting started again. This chatting then continued at the back service area of the plane for the entire 4.5h. Even when all the lights were dimmed (an overnight flight), the crews' chatting continued to disturb passengers who could use some sleep. To the crews stationed at the back should be ashamed for letting down your passengers and kept chatting for 4.5 hours - something that I did not expect even from the worst budget airlines.

### "is not a budget airline"
Karachi to Baku via Dubai. This is not a budget airline, in fact it is the worst airline I have ever flown. The nightmare started as I started to book my and my wife’s ticket on line. The opening cost was Rs 52,200. Well I was happy for that. Then began the nightmare. For every seat I chose I had to pay. Then down the page I had to dish out “administrative charges”. Before flying I had to sent this ticket to their local office to put the stamp of “ok to board, that cost another Rs 500 each. So the total cost came to Rs 59000 per ticket. On our flight to Baku I noticed they didn’t provide a pillow even, what to talk of other facilities. On our return flight the flight from Baku to Dubai was late by 45 minutes and the flight from Dubai to Karachi was late by 2 hours. Horrible experience.

### "my experience was a good one"
After reading the reviews on this site, I was dreading my day trip to Dubai on flydubai. I normally travel business class so economy class on a budget airline was new to me. My feelings were entirely misplaced. I had booked extra legroom seats at around $26 per sector. I checked in online and was able to go straight through to the departures area. As a Visa Infinite card holder, I was able to use the excellent Dilmun Lounge. The flight boarded and departed on time. The extra legroom made a huge difference with the added bonus that my row was empty. As many reviewers have mentioned, all amenities onboard are on a “pay per use” basis. I do not see any problem with this. The flight arrived on time though the taxi to DXB terminal 2 was long and we had to wait for 5 planes to depart before crossing a knives runway. The bus ride to the terminal was long. I cheekily went straight through the “fast track” passport control and was not challenged. The return flight was much the same. The checkin area looked chaotic so I was glad that I had checked in online. Spent some time in the very crowded Marhaba Lounge, courtesy of my Visa Infinite Card. The lounge would have been great but was packed. Boarding was quick and once again, I had a whole row to myself. The flight departed on time and arrived early into Bahrain. I was though passport control (fast track) and customs within 5 minutes. In summary, my experience was a good one: My plane (as with all flydubai’s planes) was relatively new. The crew were extremely friendly and helpful. Although the legroom looks a bit tight, it is no more so than most other airlines (including Lufthansa and BA). Anyone who wants extra legroom can purchase an extra legroom seat. I have no issue with Buy on Board - this is becoming the standard, even with legacy carriers. A good trip and my experience seems to be different from those of other reviewers.

### "it should be cheaper!"
Dubai to Kiev. This low cost company is pretty good. Seats in the plane are comfortable. There is some basic entertainment system. Staff is helpful. Of course extra charges for everything: food, movies, etc. Since it low cost it should be cheaper! I don't understand why prices are similar to bigger airlines.

### "never thought of looting customers"
Dubai to Trivandrum. I am writing this to bring it to your attention about an experience happened to me and my brother while we are travelling. We went to India on 9th of Feb 2018 and our final destination was Trivandrum. We were occupying 19th row seats. After take off, may be after 1.30 mins my brother went to toilet and fainted and fell down due to some health issues. He is a diabetic and Blood pressure patient. Suddenly crew members with the help of other passengers given him some water and Juices. He seems to be ok for the next 30 mins. After that he told me that he is not feeling well. Suddenly he went to the backside toilet and on his way it self he started vomiting. Some fellow passengers also got disturbed and i was the one who was cleaning all this. I really dont care as he is my brother. The issue happened afterwards, as he was requesting to lay down and they offered him a seat in business class for 10 mins. He was taken to the business class and i approached the attendant who was there to allow him to stay there as I can see half of the business class seats were empty. But he said that its full and I told him that i am ready to pay as i cant keep him there in that situation. There was only 1 hour 30 minutes remaining for landing and he asked me whether you want to pay for this. I said if you allows him to stay back then its fine then he said no. Then i agreed to pay the cost of 2200 AED which was collected from my card after 15 mins. After this I went to check my brother and he was asking me to keep the passenger who was sitting with us in business class so that he can lay down in my lap. So he was taking rest in my lap having issues to do proper breathing. After landing we arranged the airport doctor and took directly to the hospital. Here i would like to raise some points,  what help you are offering if their is any emergency situation like this. If that person is not well at all, at least a courtesy to keep in a comfy place were he can get some rest. I know that staff have incentives for upgrades and up selling but you need to educate your staffs not to use their up selling skills at an emergency. Today this happened to me and my brother and tomorrow to anyone else. I am not disputing for the payment which i have done as he took the payment with all my permission. I don't think anyone will think about the money when your brother in that condition. In my past 12 years experience in hospitality i have gone through lots of emergency situations, but me or my management never thought of looting customers at that time. I made an official complain regarding this and after 16 long days, i just received a reply from them saying that sorry to inform that we are not able to refund your money.

### "we had a poor experience"
This so called Budget airline had low quality and zero service! But then why was the price exactly the same as an Emirates ticket? I travelled from Mumbai to Dubai on 4th March, the price I paid was actually the same as Emirates, around rupees 15000 for a 1 way adult ticket. I really regreted not buying Emirates and chosing this poor flydubai flight! Overall this experience was a nightmare! Firstly, the booking emailed to me had errors from their side but there was no response from flydubai contact centre despite trying to reach them several times for amendments! Secondly, the flight was delayed with no prior announcement and nobody at the check in was announcing anything unless we went up to them and asked them what was happening. Thirdly, the plane looked old and sorry to mention but the cabin crew appearances were also not upto the mark. The only female attendant who spoke Hindi on this Mumbai flight was quite rude and arrogant in dealing with passengers. Fourthly, Flydubai said you have to buy your own meals but no one even served water! No TV channels, no entertainment unless you pay to watch TV. 1 passenger asked for a blanket and attendant said, 'sorry blankets are only for business class'. Later another passenger told the same attendant that she was feeling cold so this attendant turned off/lowered the ac for everyone making it quite hot inside the plane. There is such tough competition thats why bussinesses offer something memorable to their customers but it was shocking to see how much they dont care about their service. Overall we had a poor experience and wished there was a human touch of kindness somewhere in your service.

### "very little space between seats"
Flew flydubai from Male to Dubai via Colombo. There was very little space between seats so we were like sardines, and the seats were very small and uncomfortable. The air-conditioning was far too cold and only after a few customers complained did they finally turn it up. Our ticket stated “standard meal included” but airline did not recognise this so we had to buy refreshments. (I’ve taken this up with my travel agent too). Our TV's did not work and when we showed the flight attendants they shrugged and said some aren’t working. We would have had to pay for earphones if TV had been working. Unbelievable.

### "poor aircraft equipment"
Flew from Dubai to Bratislava. Horrible service and poor aircraft equipment. Where to start? Coffee and water are not for free! Water really? No snack! Inflight Entertainment doesn't work, even you buy it! Cabin crew do not collect garbage. In general I would say that you can choose from many budget airlines which offer higer service for a better price! If you have another option then do not waste your time and money with flydubai.

### "worst flight that I had"
Bahrain to Dubai. Flight has been delayed twice. They keep people waiting and they have really a bad customer service. Its been the worst flight that I had. I thought it’ll be better because of the marketing but it doesn’t deliver well.

### "provides way less than  others"
Beirut to Bangkok (Dubai layover) via FlyDubai. The flight attendants are friendly, at least most of them. The smell when entering the aircraft was unbearable, coming straight of the toilets, the AC was at minimum power, which left us suffocating inside the plane, and was not turned on properly until reaching cruising altitude. The seats are very tight, not comfortable at all, you can't lean forward to sleep, heck you can barely perform safety measures when docking down. I booked my ticket online and requested meals on all of my 4 flights via flydubai, but no meal was served to me, they said my name was not on the list so they cannot serve me any meal, so I offered to pay for a meal but they declined saying there is an exact number of meals for the exact number of passengers names on the meal list. So I asked for water, same story, there are not bottle of water, so I also offered to pay for one, but they also declined. A nice stewardess offered me tap water. If I had known that, I would have got some food and drinks from the duty free prior the flight. Entertainment, a 7 hour flight from Bangkok to Dubai should have movies or songs, but to my surprise, I couldn't watch without paying via credit card or cash (35 Derham ) while i've been on many airlines before and they never never asked for a payment to use the screen to watch movies, series or listen to music which was very frustrating. I ended up paying, money is no issue but it's about the concept. So basically, choosing flydubai, even though it cost less than the other airlines, but it also offers and provides way less than the others, so instead of saving 150$-200$ on a flight, when taking flydubai you are only paying for a seat to sit on instead of standing during the entire flight, nothing more.

### "never ever again"
FlyDubai is the worst of airlines that I ever used. My flight was from Istanbul to Dubai, and after 5 days from Dubai to Colombo. Airplane seats are very uncomfortable, you don't have space for keeping small bag under neath which you basically need for long flights such are 4-5 hours flights. Cabin crew was mess at both flights, not paying attention at passengers. Bar offer is very bad: cheap wines, low variety of food. Screens were out of order both flights and they are producing hot air all flight. Cabin had extremely dry and hot air in first part of cabin and crew cannot do much about this. I needed change of dates for return and that was very complicated and very expensive to arrange when you take in consideration fact that you are getting such low service. Overall: never ever again!

### "seats were unbelievably small"
Flew flydubai from Dubai to Istanbul. The worst airline I have ever flown, the seats were unbelievably small and tight. The quality of the seats was bad, the seat on my second flight was broken and the recline wasn't working. Furthermore the entertainment screen on my seat was broken for all my flights.

### "No respect for customers"
Dubai to Faisalabad. Did not allow me to check in online due to nationality issues as they wanted to verify my credit card. However at check in counter no one asked for credit card. Long ques at Checkin with only two counters open for many flights. Again long ques for boarding and a 35 min wait in the bus to get on board. Tight leg space. No respect for customers. Not recommended at all. In low cost operations , their competitor air Arabia is way ahead.

### "no compensation given"
I had a flight in flydubai last night December 24, 2017, boarding in Muscat to Dubai supposedly at 17:05 and arriving in Dubai at 18:10. However we departed from Oman at 22:53 and we landed Dubai at 12:30. Worst ever experience as the crew at the airport doesn't care about what we feel. I am at the airport from 14:00 as i don't want to miss my flight. I've waited for 9 hours and when i ask for a manager to complain, the staff just answer me that they are not available anymore and just log a complain on the site. I missed my appointments because of the delay and their is no compensation given on the delay.

### "flight was delayed 3 hours"
Dubai to Jeddah. I had a miserable time as the flight was delayed 3 hours then another hour on the plane. I booked transport that was missed and not refunded, also we arrived very late to Makkah, very exhausted could not do Umrah on time also we had problems with the hotel and it was too late to fix it. We had a problem with our TV screen and the attendant refused to let me move to another seat. It was a horrible experience, we hope we will not face it again going back to Dubai.

### "worst flight of my life"
Dubai to Kathmandu. Horrible airline, this was the worst flight of my life. It was so hot in my seat that I thought I would pass out. Not only was there no air coming from the vents, my “tv” that didn’t work was overheating, creating more unbearable heat. To top it all off they didn’t have half their menu and the bathrooms were the dirtiest I have ever seen on a flight. These horrendous conditions got me sick, do yourself a favor and fly with another airline.

### "worst airlines I flew"
Dubai to Kathmandu. This airline is one of the worst airlines I flew. Crew members were so arrogant as I asked something. I had elderly my mother travelling with me and I was seated in economy. It was so cold when i asked a blanket and pillow for my elderly mom, they refused to give. I was happy to pay them for business class because business class was empty, but they refused to help me. I finally bought blanket paying certain amount. They should treat people in economy class as human beings.

### "have gotten so much worse"
Muscat to Dubai. FlyDubai has gone south. Instead of improving they have gotten so much worse. Delays guaranteed no matter when you take the flight. My one hour flight delayed 45 minutes to one hour on each leg. You can't blame the staff, but there is no sense of urgency or sorry. Most importantly, FlyDubai has hiked their prices so much that they are comparable if not more expensive than the competing airline flying the same route.

### "traveling supposed to be fun"
I travel a lot but never have I experienced such poor service twice. The first time was the 22nd September 2017 when the flight attendants were extremely rude, not professional or accommodating, they spoke disrespectfully not only to me but to others. Of course the flight was late as usual. Thought to myself it happens, flydubai is trying to work on their service and reputation, let me try flying with them again. Let's be honest for a 3 day quick get away the price is right that's why I chose them in the first place. 3 weeks later 12th October, I planned another short get away so I booked with flydubai again hoping it will be a better experience. Let me tell you, it was far worse than the first trip. First they were late as usual, second 90% of the flight were using the menus to fan themselves. For 30 mins, people were sweating including the flight attendants, and guess what flight attendants were rude again. TV does not work and if it does it overheats. Do not take flydubai, put in a little extra and save yourself the frustration, traveling is supposed to be fun, but they've managed to ruin the fun part.

### "little leg room for a business class"
Very little leg room for a business class seating. For a journey less than 3 hours it would be fine, but more than that I think I would opt for another airline. The airline has its own Business Class Boarding gate at Dubai Airport's terminal 2, which is a long walk from the Business Class lounge. Food was and on board service was ok. In flight entertainment was inclusive and had a good variety but no remote is provided so every time the volume or channel needs to be changed you have to reach out to the screen which is not good.

### "Nice budget airline"
Riyadh to Dubai. Nice budget airline providing the minimum requirements for a short flight. Boaring was ok and takeoff almost on time. For short flights less than 2 hours I would recommend this airline. Flight attendants friendly and carry out the required safety duties.

### "best cabin crew I've seen"
It's one of the rare days where I've made an effort to go on a website and write a good review about the services which I received on board. Not a frequent flydubai customer but would like to use it more frequently from now onwards. It's not just that you have comfortable seats in your flight and the fact that departure is from T2 in Dubai (closer to home) but I'm glad to see the quality of your inflight staff. All of them were good - one was extremely helpful and professional throughout the flight and probably the best cabin crew I've seen. I'd say keep it up flydubai for the quality of staff that you hire. And yes, the one who did my check in was great too. A suggestion though, if we can have a few more vegetarian options on selected routes that'd be great.

### "very unhelpful and rude"
Dubai to Baku. Very disappointed by customer service and crew. Price was not bad but they have some really stupid rules which they follow by the book, and that's how they make money. This trip cost me far more than what I originally planned for, because this airline is not trying to help, very unhelpful and rude. They are Not flexible at all and even call centre was very rude and not caring at all, Airplane was fine but no food, drink, headphones not even blanket for children.

### "cabin crew kind and caring"
We flew flydubai on the 24th August 2017 FZ559 (Colombo to Dubai) and the cabin crew were very kind and caring. They were very much listening to passengers and cooperative. I will definitely use flydubai next time. The TV screens were malfunctioning but we were allowed to use available empty seats to use the entertainment system. We missed nothing during our flight.

### "seats very uncomfortable"
Almaty to Dubai with flydubai. Pros - easy to book, affordable prices. Flexible policy to change the ticket date with no extra charge even in less than 24 hours before the flight. USB charger. Cons - seats don't recline and very uncomfortable. Screens were switched off and nobody knew on which altitude are we, where are we, therefore there was no entertainment. Found a lot of black hair and some rubbish in the seat pocket for magazines. For the cost of airline at least a free water would be a good gesture.

### "I want to report a problem"
Dubai to Muscat. I dont have a specific problem with the airline, it's a low cost so what do you expect. I want to report a problem with one of the FlyDubai's staff at their information counter (DXB Terminal 2). I went to their counter to ask how to check in the wedding dress I had just bought. I was expecting some sort of nice reply and flexibility (my ticket was allowing me to check in only a 7kg hand luggage). She immediately started ranting telling me that the aircraft is small after I had told her that we could certainly hang it. She then said that the flight is fully booked so there is no space to hang it. Then she said "You need to buy an extra ticket - for an extra seat". I said "how can I buy an extra ticket if the flight is fully booked? She started blabbering something but I didnt even listen because I was so mad, I thanked her and left to go check in. Fortunately I found someone normal who told me that the dress needs to go to the cabin and that there is no problem with that.

### "seats are too small and narrow"
Dubai to Kuwait. The seats are too small and narrow. I found out too late that fly dubai operate to Sheikh Saad Al Abdallah General Aviation Terminal and not Kuwait Airport, so when they landed I thought we landed at Kuwait airport and my husband was on his way to pick me up from Kuwait airport. I got stuck at flydubai's airport and then had to use their taxi to get out of their airport. They should notify customers that they have their own airport so that travelers can arrange to pick up the traveler from that airport.

### "Absolutely horrible experience"
Bahrain to Dubai. Worst airline ever! For some reason i decided to give it one more shot and it turned out that a one hour flight took 6 hrs. Ruined my weekend. Worst part of it was that I learned that the airline knew that they had delays and technical problems and never informed the passengers until after checking in so that they dont lose the business. Plus, they gave us the option to cancel the ticket with no refund. This airline doesnt respect people nor values time. Absolutely horrible experience.

### "worst airline operating"
Muscat to Zanzibar via Dubai. Possibly the worst airline operating. This was my 2nd flight with them. This time from Muscat to Zanzibar, where they delayed my baggage for 6 days on my 7 days vacation, so they practically left me stranded on an island. Worst thing was they had a flight everyday, and I was told on 3 occasion that my bag was tagged for the next flight, and since they don't deliver bag to your hotel, I must have spent hrs at the airport -  most of the times their flight was delayed by 4 hrs on a 5 hrs route , only to be told the my bag has not arrived. I never stopped getting generic email offering their sincere apologies for any inconvenience caused! They also failed to mention a voucher for delayed baggage, which if i would not have read, would not have received. I plan to use my voucher, obviously with carry on bag & never ever to fly with them again, & advise the same to any fellow traveler who loves their piece of mind.

### "Never fly on Flydubai again"
Dubai to Dushanbe. Never fly on Flydubai again, because it is unreliable, not responsive, provides poor service at normal airfare rates and shows lowest level of customer care. And to add a small observation, Flydubai does not even provide a drop of water. On 1st of June we had purchased three air tickets to fly from Kabul to Dushanbe. The tickets were issued by Atlantic Travel in Kabul and paid in cash at 354$ per person/team members. On 2nd of June we moved to Kabul airport around 15.30 hrs to check in and take the flight at 18.15 hrs to Dubai and to connect on FZ 777 from Dubai to Dushanbe at 22.35 hrs. At the check in we received the boarding cards for both flights. The flight FZ 306 was announced on the notice board as scheduled for 18.15 hrs. However after making enquiries at 19.00 hrs the ground staff of Flydubai informed us that FZ306 had been cancelled and another Flydubai flight may only be expected the following day (Saturday). Passengers were advised to use the waiting flight of SAFI 4Q0201 scheduled to depart at 19.30 hrs. In view of our connecting flight from Dubai we followed this advice. As Flydubai ground staff refused to endorse the tickets in hand we had to buy new tickets for the SAFI flight SAFI 4Q0201 at 267 $ per person. Then we boarded the delayed flight of SAFI to Dubai in anticipation to reach Dushanbe in good time. But on arrival in Dubai we failed to get on the Flydubai FZ 777 to Dushanbe, which had already left. At Terminal 2 we requested the Flydubai office to arrange an onward flight to Dushanbe at the earliest opportunity. To our disappointment, we were informed that the next available flight by Flydubai would be only on Tuesday 6th June which was after our scheduled meeting in Dushanbe for 5th June. In addition we were told that Flydubai could not endorse tickets to other airlines offering earlier connections. The only option given would be reserving seats on the next flight on Tuesday, the 6th June. Flydubai refused to secure and provide hotel accommodation in Dubai for the waiting days. In spite of repeated reminders Flydubai failed to respond to our complaint to refund the costs of the cancelled flight FZ 306 or the middle class hotel costs.

### "experience was the worst"
Dubai to Belgrade. Overall experience was the worst. The plane was too crowded, crew is missing the knowledge of customer service, food was served on the most of the aircraft, and then the rest of us were waiting for almost 1 hour to be served. By the time they managed to give us food, we only had a choice of vegeterian option, which was spicy. The crew member was having bunch of forks and knives in his hands and has given some to us just like that, one by one, no packed cutlery. On the way back, my husband was travelling alone, even though he had a ticket paid more than 2 weeks before our travel, there was no meal for him at the aircraft. He was the only one told that he was supposed to pre-book a meal online, which was not said anywhere and was not the case in our first flight. In the end the crew managed to find him the same vegetarian dish that we had when we were travelling together. This is the last time travelling with this airline!

### "likely to avoid Fly Dubai"
Dubai to Beirut. Being that it was my first Fly Dubai experience, I was not familiar with the way it works, but the booking experience should have more transparent instructions. I ended up paying 450 AED for luggage for only the outbound part of my trip. While checking in, I was prompted that after check in I cannot add "excess baggage". In the dictionary of airlines, excess baggage means baggage exceeding your check in allowance. If the concept behind Fly Dubai is a cheaper airline with option to pay for baggage, later explained to me after paying an unreasonable amount for 1 piece of luggage, then when checking in it should prompt the customer to "add baggage" not "excess baggage". This is extremely misleading. And when I was buying my ticket, it indicated 1 x 7kg carry on and 1 x 31kg check in - that is what I thought my allowance was. Why did it say that if I was then forced to pay for it? After paying this ridiculous amount for my 1 piece of checked in luggage, I was told to pay online for my luggage on the return flight. However, upon checking in for my return flight, there was no prompt nor was there an option to add any baggage. I checked in and then called FlyDubai, spending more money on an unnecessary long distance phone call. The representative explained that my return flight had an "offer" for 1 free checked in bag. Why did the first agent on my outbound flight tell me to pay online for the return. Huge customer service fail. Website is unclear, misleading, and user unfriendly. Customer service doesn't provide accurate guidance. Next, the tv screens on the flight are a disaster. I paid 35AED for the movies option, but the touch screen barely works! By the end of each flight, both outbound & inbound, my fingers were sore from pressing so many times until the screen responded to my selection. When it finally did respond and my movie played, it skipped half the time! Making the entire movie unenjoyable. Lastly, why create a food menu when the items on that menu are always sold out? I imagine only the first 10 rows actually obtain what they request from the menu. Either enforce a pre-purchase online or offer snacks only in-flight. These instances really give this airline a messy image. You can be a budget airline, but have it together. You are not currently achieving that and after this experience, I am likely to avoid Fly Dubai going forward.

### "Very unhappy customer"
❎ Unverified |  Dubai to Bangkok. Trouble from the get-go with this airline. The website sign up for flier miles did not work. It took 5 phone calls to get it set up. Total waste of time and phone credits. No leg room on board. Flier miles not credited to my account afterwards. Airline says I must claim them. Not automatically awarded. Was never told this. Called and emailed them again. Total refusal to credit my account. Very unhappy customer. Avoid this airline if you value comfort and convenience.

### "staff were helpful, kind, calm"
Dubai to Riyadh. Having been delayed on route to the airport by a traffic accident we arrived 20 minutes after the final bag check in time. I was convinced that we would not be allowed to get onto the flight regardless of having already checking in on line, as it was such a long time past the final check in time. I went to the Flydubai customer service rep who, when I explained my problem to her, called over a floor manager and called their check in desk. She directed me to the desk where they opened the flight back up and allowed me to check in my bag. We was then rapidly escorted through security and ran to the departure gate. When we arrived at the gate, considerably flustered, we were told not to worry and ushered onboard the coach. Onboard the flight there were a number of families who were not able to book seats next to each other and with the co-operation of the single customers and organisation of the crew, they were all accommodated. The plane was very comfortable with more than enough room even though it was fully booked and the attendance of the crew was faultless. Throughout this whole process the staff were helpful, kind, calm and went far beyond the scope of expected service.

### "no luggage has arrived"
Dubai to Kathmandu. 5 hours delay at night without any proper information or even glass of water. No beverages or anything to eat during the flight. I had to wait 2 hours more at the Kathmandu airport to get the information that no luggage has arrived! I was told that it will come with next flight at 18:00, a few hours later. I had to take a taxi to the hostel and back to the airport, no compensation, I was refused the proper registration of my claim, they told me I have to speak to the captain of next flight. The flight at 18:00 was delayed as well so I had to wait another 2 hours. The general terms and conditions of flydubai require that my claim should be delivered in writing within 21 days. How could I do it when I'm trekking in Himalaya?

### "absolutely get what you pay for"
Flew Kathmandu to Dubai. Flydubai proves the theory that you absolutely get what you pay for. What seems like a deal is simply payment for a less than optimal customer experience complete with lost baggage and absolute disregard for traveler's most critical needs. Case in point: A recent 3 day visit to Dubai was all but ruined given the fact that I was forced to spend the entire 3 days of my visit enlisting my hotel's staff and calling directly to this airline in an attempt to claim my lost luggage checked from Kathmandu to Dubai in the past week. Despite promises from the airline for calls back and assurances that the baggage would be on a later flight on the day of my arrival, it was only on day 3 of my trip that a final call from the hotel to the airline revealed that the luggage had been found. However, to add insult to injury, the hotel was informed that I would be required to return to the airport to pick up my luggage rather than the airline rectifying their mistake by delivering the baggage to my hotel as any other reputable carrier would. In the end, I was forced to pay for the airline's mistake as I was required to pay airport taxi fees (higher than other taxis) to collect my lost luggage in time for my departing flight on the following early morning. Upon picking up my baggage, I was treated yet again, poorly being made to wait for at least an hour before being able to claim my bag, and also being met by rude staff who clearly couldn't have cared less that they'd so badly bungled the handling of my and many other passenger's belonging. This airline is unbelievably inept. A truly disappointing experience.

### "delayed at check-in for one hour"
Dubai to Beirut with flydubai. Delayed us in a queue at check-in for one hour while my baby was screaming on the way out - no help. The same delay happened on our flight back to Dubai. There justification for the line? We have a delayed flight so we have to keep you all in a queue" - imagine. Second thing was not having a bassinet so I had to carry my baby the 4 hours duration of a flight on the way to Beirut.

### "very slow not enough cabin crew"
Khartoum to Dubai. Full flight, only 4 cabin crew in Economy and 1 cabin crew in Business Class. Service very slow not enough cabin crew, waited 2hrs to be served refreshments. Not enough refreshments provided, catering did not match catering to passenger list why? Especially for evening flight, limited food available for 3.5hrs flight, unsatisfactory.

### "the worst travel experience"
Muscat to Bangkok via Dubai. Horrible Airline FlyDubai I was traveling with my family to Bangkok on 26th March 2017 in FlyDubai Business Class. On that day morning I received an email from FlyDubai that the flight I was traveling was cancelled and I have to call their Dubai phone number to reschedule my flight. After waiting for over 20 minutes on line listening to the music, a representative came on line and the tickets were rescheduled for late evening departure (9.45pm flight) from Muscat to be able to connect the Bangkok flight leaving from Dubai at 01.50am. We reached airport by 7.30pm to take the flight. We were shocked to learn at the counter that the rescheduled flight was also cancelled. Again series of calls to Dubai, and requests to call back, about half a dozen customer service agents making all kinds of false promises, we had to return home close to midnight totally frustrated, irritated and dejected with nothing sensible achieved with so many calls. Next day early morning against started with calls to FlyDubai. After series of international calls and text messages I received a call from FlyDubai at about 8.40am on 27th March. I explained to him that I am traveling with my family and that my son already reached Bangkok from India and we should have reached Bangkok by this time and that we are still in Muscat because the flight on the previous night was cancelled. He said he will call me back, and indeed he did call me back to say that the FlyDubai flight scheduled to leave at 900 will leave at 11.45 and if we can reach airport in 20 minutes we may be accepted to board the flight. We agreed and reached airport in less than the allotted time. We were made to wait at the counter by a rude and irrational counter clerk. After about 30 minutes of series of phone calls to FlyDubai we were given gate passes. The customer service agent said he will reschedule our return journey to a later date as per our request because our outbound travel was delayed and that I have to send him my Bangkok phone number to which he can call and speak to me. I sent dozens of text messages with my Bankgkok contact phone number, but never was there a call from anybody at FlyDubai customer service. This is the worst travel experience I had in my travel experience and this is probably my last ever flight in FlyDubai.

### "great and pleasant flight"
Flew from Isfahan to Dubai. Check-in at Isfahan took less than 2 minutes and boarding was quick even though there was a long line. Arrival in Dubai wasn't that good. At baggage claim, flyDubai sent half of the luggage from that flight to another terminal by mistake and my luggage was included in that pile. It toke at least 15 more minutes for the luggage to get transferred back to Terminal 2. Overall, I had a great and pleasant flight.

### "lower price is a false economy"
Colombo to Dubai with flydubai. 2 hours delay on way out. 5 hours delay on way back. 1 announcement, no flydubai staff available. Staff in Colombo assured us that our connections would be rebooked even on other airlines. Once we got to Dubai, of course they denied this and refused to help in any way. We had to buy new one way tickets to CPH (GBP1000). Captain came on PA and never came back. We were given 1 juice carton and 2 half disgusting sandwiches after 3 hours at CMB. Final insult is that they still charged for everything on board, they probably made a fortune as everyone was so hungry and thirsty. Total time travelling 11 hours, with no free water. Then 1 hour wait for luggage at DXB. 99% of passengers on that flight will never travel with them again. The lower price is a false economy. Be warned!

### "the staff were clueless"
Rubbish service and communication! Travelling to Doha from Dubai. Short 1 hour flight at a convenient time in the afternoon. Flight was delayed for 4.5 hours. Found out the hard way. We were at the airport and was told the flight was rescheduled but nobody was sure of the exact time. Not a single email, SMS or call informing us of the delay. This is the Information Age but flydubai seems to have missed it completely. The staff were clueless and were giving us multiple flight timings. One even said that the flight would be at 2 am and if we wanted a place in it we would have to confirm right away. The airport (terminal 2) was a mess as always and we had to wait in the general check in line for 20 mins to ask someone for the right info! The info desk had no idea and sent us to the check in counter.

### "Terrible is the word"
Dubai to Muscat. Terrible is the word. I understand flydubai operate as an economy airline but that does not mean they become lax with quality all together. The experience right from checking in online to boarding the airplane is terrible. Incompetent and misinformed ground staff. Flights are not on time. This having flown with them for the past 7-8 months frequently for every week.

### "a competitive price."
Dubai to Bucharest, and a good experience with flydubai. On time flight, friendly FA, seats ok but the food (breakfast I guess) with too much sugar (a lot of sweeties). I will use them again for the good experience and a competitive price. A better experience than wizzair. As a minus, terminal 2 from Dubai Airport looks outdated and has no connection (except taxi 40 AED) from terminal 1.

### "my last trip with Flydubai"
Dubai to Istanbul. I don't advice Flydubai. The staff is rude and unprofessional. When returning back to Istanbul from Dubai at February 26, because we were late by 5 minutes (heavy rain and traffic) they didn't check us in. At the same time they accepted another couple with luggage. The explanation was they had check in before. They didn't help us. After 7 hours we returned with Flypegassus instead of Flydubai by paying extra more money. This was my last trip with Flydubai.

### "probably the worst airline "
Bucharest to Dubai. Flydubai is probably the worst airline on this planet. The cabin was horrendous and was dirty. The crew were rude and when we tried to speak to them they would tell us to sit down, even though the seatbelt sign wasn't on. We went to Bucharest, Romania for a ski trip and our flight got delayed by an hour. All the passengers were given free inflight entertainment instead of paying 35 DHS. Of course everyone was happy. But none of the TVs worked. I understand that the IFEs can sometimes break and all. Every passenger  asked why the screens were blank, to the crew responded: "So what?". We were all shocked at the behaviour of the crew. Then came meal service. I asked for a can of Sprite and they charged me double for it. They served me chicken with rice (there wasn't any other option really) and the rice was soggy and chicken seemed uncooked. I immediately reported this to the crew and they said: "We don't really care if the chicken is cooked or not so sit down". At that point I had enough and we the passengers were sick of thier rude behaviour. All passengers were sitting FOR 5 hours twiddling our thumbs because the food wasn't edible and the the IFE was broken. The seats were uncomfortable with little legroom. You will never see me near a Flydubai airplane ever again.

### "they fail in so many spots"
Bangkok to Dubai. This is the second time I fly with them and hope the last one. When we flew from Dubai to Bangkok, we were on hold for 3 hours, because they made the passengers to go inside of broken plane, which is not able to fly. I don't know what they were doing before and why they waited until all passengers will go inside of the plane, so they started to check only after that, and they understood that the plane is not able to fly! Then we had to wait for another 3 hrs to get another plane. On the way back, we were flying from Bangkok to Dubai, The crew is unprofessional. When they were talking to the guest, and his card didn't go through, they said to find alternative, and the guest asked what is the problem of the card, and the crew said most likely you don't have money inside. Then they started to argue, crew were not trying to calm the guest down, instead they were showing attitude and anger. Then when they were done with serving food and drinks, one of the crew went to sleep. he took his pillow and blanket and slept in the back seats. This is the first time I experience that kind of nonsense service. Unprofessional staff, FlyDubai will never be the best airline as they fail in so many spots!

### "worst airline in the region"
Dubai to Amman return. Horrible airline and exhausting experience, not only was I overcharged for multiple errors in bookings, but also the service on the plane was horrible. Staff unpleasant, food inedible. My honest advice is never use flydubai. The worst airline I have ever tried. Pay a little more money for your peace of mind. All flydubai customer service are outsourced with no physical offices making it impossible to reach them. You can call or email and you'll have to wait at least 30/40min for a phone call and days for an email reply. flydubai is the worst airline in the region.

### "never choose flydubai"
Prague to Colombo via Dubai. First warning: never choose flydubai, even it looked cheaper. You might get your trip totally spoilt without any compensation. My trip on 31.12.2016 in a nutshell: - total delay 24hrs, of which 20hrs in Dubai airport. Bag delayed an extra 3 days. The "reason" for delays should have been sandy fog. However, on the afternoon all the other airlines departed normally but flydubai could not even inform about flights - there was only one flydubai staff person for more than 300 (and growing) claiming customers. The staff just wrote down names and phone numbers with her pencil - did not use computer system - she told to wait for the hotel bus. After three hours she disappeared and hotel bus was never shown up (just lying!). No food, beverages or accommodation was ever offered - there was no possibility to contact any staff member and the screens were giving false information.

### "Never again Flydubai"
Kathmandu to Dubai. Arriving at Kathmandu airport 4 hrs prior to departure my friend and I had an extra bag. We knew we will have to pay for another bag which was 11 kg. We did try to book an extra bag via email prior but due to internet issues we were unable to do this. We were then told that it would cost 8000 Nepal rupees per kilo. The first quote was $3011AUD. We then asked for a manager as no way we were going to pay this for 1 x 10kg bag. 2.5 hrs later the manager arrived. It cost us $838 AUD to put the bag on. The staff did not care and did not help us when we asked for a phone number of the company and they would not provide us with the bag limit specifications. We had to be escorted to our plane as it about to leave. Never again Flydubai. It has left a sour note to our holiday.

### "crew to be more polite"
Dubai to Chennai. I board the flight and I am not greeted or welcome by the cabin crew. I locate my seat very quickly as its the last seat of the last row. I look for space to keep my handluggage and I am told "Keep it under your seat". There's no please or thank you apparently the training for manners given to the crew. I try to find space in each overhead cabinet and then she finally comes to my rescue so I thank her. She then screams at the other passenger switch off your phone - there was no please or thank you used. She tells another passenger hold this and hands her a tray of tea cups. Again there is no please or thank you used. Well all settled with my bag I settle down on my seat. Flight has taken off and I hear laughter and then look back it's the crew. I guess they are just having a moment but this continues for the rest of the flight. I call them twice and ask them to speak softly and that passengers are trying to sleep. The second time a staff comes and I tell him this again, the crew says "This is a rather small flight mam you are going to have to adjust". Adjust to what the noise that you are making? The worst experience and I would not recommend flydubai flight to anyone. This is just an experience calling to crew to be more polite and pleasant to the customer's.

### "worst experience with an airline"
The worst experience I have encountered with an airline. Doha to Dubai. Flight schedule was 29th December at 3:20pm. After almost 19hrs (boarded 3 times, disembarked 2 times) we were able to fly to Dubai December 30th at 9:50am with Emirates. Really felt like we were ping pong balls. Passengers were angry, dissapointed, disgusted. There were so many reasons for the delay. First, because of the fog (understandable since they had bad weather in Dubai). Second, (passengers were already inside the plane and disembarked after 1 hr) some mechanical problem, a tire needed to be fixed or changed and scheduled our next departure time around 11pm (pretty understandable). After 11 pm, it got worse, no gate, no boarding time, no announcement, no clear information what time was our flight, and flydubai staff just handed out another batch of meal vouchers. At around 3:30am, we thought we really were going to Dubai, all passengers inside the plane (the 2nd time). Just as about we were to take off, the pilot announced he's heading back to the gate as there were not allowed to fly, something about number of flying hours. We waited for the bus to pick us up. Back inside the airport, no sleep our hopes crushed. Passengers missed their transit flights, appointments, booking reservations, concerts. AFter some heated argument and pressurefrom the passengers, flydubai staff arranged and transferred our flights either with Qatar airways or Emirates (most of us whose final destination is Dubai).

### "delayed 18 hrs, no hotel, no refreshment"
Business journey from Prague to Dubai return flight FZ 780 flydubai. Departure at 13:20 pm from Prague. Business priority class. Everything went wrong from the moment we have arrived to the airport to check-in. flydubai supervisor let us check in without a word about any problem. But I could hear something about late taking off to another customer who wanted to go to passport control. I had to go to her and ask her directly, if the information of flight delay is correct. She said: Yes, approximately 4 hours of being delayed. I went to her again and ask her if it is true, because we are having a meeting in Dubai, hotel confirmed and we are going to see the New Year´s fireworks. She answered: It is your problem. You must be comming earlier. When it was 17:30 pm, there was a sign on departure schedule board: Dubai FZ780: departure 23:00. No one came to us, no info what is happening etc. After my asking to airport staff I was answered that there is a thick fog at DXB airport (but plane is from 15:30 at Prague airport). FlyDubai supervisor wasn´t at her office and no one could reach her. No official info from flydubai representative. It was a really poor apology and answer about the fog. Turkish airlines, Emirates with the big airbus, SwissAir, SmartWings and many other flights from PRG to DXB were departing and the flights from DXB were landing in PRG. But only FlyDubai customers were sitting on the floor in a hall and waiting hours for new information. I have checked the weather radar at DXB airport from my notebook and the visibility was from 8km to 10km. After another complaining, I got the phone number to flydubai representative help line. No answer, just automatic speech (Thank you for your calling to flydubai, for communication in english press 1 and my call was automaticly cancelled). Help line didn´t help at all. Finally at 22:00 a new schedule of Dubai departure showed PRG to DXB FZ780 FlyDubai: 1:00 am 1st January 2017. I was so upset and annoyed. I realized that my business, hotel reservation and New Year´s firework are totally buried. I wanted my money back and wanted to cancel the journey. When I reached the flydubai representative, I was told that no cancellation is available due to weather conditions. I asked the captain with his crew who were just passing us and arrived to PRG from Africa with stop on DXB and continuing to PRG and he told us, that it is nice and sunny in DXB without any problems. The representative of flydubai told us after this, that pilots need to have a rest and will not fly. After protests of other passangers, they gave us 10 dollars ticket for refreshment, but in Duty free zone there was everything closed because of the New Year´s Eve. At midnight a member of airport came to business lounge and said: The lounge closes normally at 19:00 and it is 24:00 now. Go to the counters down to the hall to the others. Small kids, infants, old people, no matter. At 1:00am next day departure schedule board shows FlyDubai FZ780 to DXB planned departure 7:00 morning. Flight delayed 18 hrs in total, no hotel (they said none available), no refreshment, no help, no info, no more flydubai.

### "delayed for 32 hours"
Dubai to Jeddah return. We had the worst experience, me and my husband delayed for 32 hours. We were supposed to fly to Jeddah thursday night and return friday night, we to airport to be told that there are no place on the plane because they are overbooked! They take your money confirm your booking and then tell you to go search for another flight. After 1hour arguing with unprofessional team they finally give us seats they were hiding - I don't know for what. Got boarding 2 hours late but we finally arrived at 8:30 on Friday morning. We booked return in the same day arrived to airport to get delayed for 32 hours - they kept us in the boarding gate for 14 hours and no one showed up to tell us what is the reason for delay although we asked for many times. They leave people in a small room sleeping on the dirty floor overnight in cold. Until noon of next day no one of the company showed up. They treat people in unrespectable way.

### "the most appalling airline"
Muscat to Dubai with flydubai. I was early for my flight and asked if there were expected delays as a consequence of the fog I had read about in Dubai. The airport staff said there were delays - so I was warned even though the information wasn't offered. And yes, 'delayed' featured heavily on the departures board. That really was the last contact I or other travelers had with flydubai staff until around 4 hours after or flight was due to depart. Quite simply, they disappeared until we were told to leave the departure gate we were at as it was to be used for another flight. We hunted down a staff member who apologized for not knowing anything, and referred us to a gentleman who offered a meal for the inconvenience. When we returned it was bedlam. Angry customers were chasing the only 2 flydubai staff that were brave enough to front. They could offer no guarantees or times for the 'likely' flight. A scheduled departure time of 12.50 pm turned into a takeoff at 22.45. My scheduled connection was missed, my New Years Day plans ruined. Thanks flydubai - I'm writing this 24 hours after checking my bags in at Muscat with the prospect of another 18 hours of travel with what I now regard as the most appalling airline I've ever had the misfortune to deal with, and there are many.

### "disorganized and frustrating experience"
Tbilisi to Dubai with flydubai. 4 hour delay leaving Tbilisi without apology, and kiosks at airport were reluctant to accept the inadequate 15GEL meal voucher that the airline is required to provide. Upon arrival in Dubai, luggage from baggage reclaim took over an hour to appear with no notifications, apologies or information provided - queries to airport staff were dismissed without any attempt to help. Overall very disorganized and frustrating experience. Will not be taking flydubai by choice again.

### "utterly disastrous experience"
Dubai to Muscat with flydubai. An utterly disastrous experience. There was fog in Dubai, so not the airline's fault, but they knew very well there would be delays and they did not advise on boarding (which was late). Once on board it became apparent that the crew had no idea about take off time. This should have been made clear prior so that passengers could have elected to not board. The fog was quickly gone but time was put further and further back. All other airlines were taking off with 60-90 minute delays. After 3.5hrs, passengers requested to offload. This was agreed but took ages as the police have to attend offloadings. Back at the airport, the FlyDubai desk was a disaster, there was no organisation re refunds, no support whatsoever. It's Twitter stream is dead. The customer services phone line rings out unanswered. This was my first time with this airline. It will be my last.

### "recommend to choose row 6"
Prague to Male return via Dubai. Check in and boarding procedure in Prague was easy. There is meal provided on route PRG-DXB and back. As well you get small box with drink and small snack. Next route to Male you need to pay for food and drink. Soft drinks 2USD (300ml), beer and wine 8USD (300ml), spirits 8USD (50ml), wrap/sandwiches 5-8USD. You need to pay for entertainment as well as for WIFI. Crew was standard, nothing special, they will help you if you have any specific troubles. Boeing 737-800 has 3x3 config and I can recommend to choose row 6 (at online checking, otherwise you pay for it 30USD) or exit row if you want to stretch your legs. Otherwise it is not easy to take rest on long distance flights. Overhead lockers were big enough for us. Aircrafts are pretty new, so everything was clean and tidy. Business class in front is "locked" for economy passengers, so need to go to toilet to rearward and wait long queue.

### "all flights delayed"
Erbil to Beirut via Dubai. First of all, I thought flydubai would an amazing airline. Then, I discovered it is the worst I've used. All flights delayed. Take off and landing was delayed between 45 minutes to one hour. My flight from Beirut to Dubai, the crew did not apologize for being late by more than 30 minutes. The PTV screens are low quality of screens which you have to touch ten times so you can type just one letter not to mention how it bothers the person who sits in the front. Screens are awful and not functional. The flights are pricey but without service compared to other airlines. Everything which is free on other airlines is charged on flydubai (watching a movie, entertainment, meal, drink etc). They are not only charged, but very expensive as well. The seat spaceis tight - I will never fly on flydubai again and will not recommend this airline to anyone.

### "recommend this airline"
Dubai to Tehran. Flydubai provided kind assistance when faced with immigration problems in Tehran. I was not aware that one cannot withdraw money from an ATM inside Iran, so upon arrival, I could not afford the visa and insurance fees required to enter the country. The airline was quick to arrive at the airport after immigration called them, and they then helped me arrange an alternative solution - so I would not be deported. I would highly recommend this airline, and staff at flydubai for helping me out of this situation.

### "last time on this airline"
Dubai to Alexandria with flydubai. This is the worst airline I fly with, always late, not well organized. I booked my flight 3 weeks ago with 30 kg luggage while going to Dubai and 40 kg luggage while getting back to Alexandria. I changed the return ticket date only. When I arrived at the airport going back to Alexandria, they told me that I didn't book a luggage again which I had already paid before. They made me pay more than the flight price and the changing date price. This is my last time on this airline.

### "worst airline I have used"
Dubai to Amman. This is the worst airline I have used. Worst experience for me and my family. First, although I had a confirmed tickets many many months ahead each of us (me, wife and two children) had to sit in a different seat even the little kids (7 and 10 years). Seating was a total chaos. I asked for a tea and they said 10 AED for each me and my wife. I paid it then they handed us the packs with no cup or water. We thought they will give us that but when they didn't we asked and was shocked to hear that we had to pay another 10 AED each for hot water to drink the tea we just order. The attitude was horrible.

### "lots of legroom in economy"
First time flying Flydubai. The 737-800 was very comfortable on this short 60 min flight to Bahrain. The plane is new so the interior is airy and open with big windows. Lots of legroom in economy and each seat has a built-in interactive IFE on which you can also order food. However, the touch screen was not very responsive. Kind of annoying. A small detail, but one I've never seen before - on the IFE it tells you what percentage of your flight is complete, besides just how much time to your destination. Kind of cool.

### "experience was positive"
Beirut to Dubai. I am reviewing this carrier comparing it with similar i.e. low cost airline. Dedicated check-in for business class, no queue. Business Class passengers don't queue at the boarding gate. I was accommodated at seat 2F, window. Large individual screen with a decent selection of entertainment. For lunch I was served dory fish as main course and the lunch was tasty. Seat is not flat bed but reclining enough to make a 3 to 4.5 hours journey comfortable enough. Overall the experience was positive and would fly again in Business Class with Flydubai. Value for money is excellent.

### "epitome of a low cost carrier"
Bishkek to Bahrain via Dubai. The epitome of a low cost carrier lies firmly with Fly Dubai. I flew the carrier from Bishkek to Bahrain via Dubai. With a six hour layover, one would think there is sufficient time for baggage to make the connection. But upon arrival in Bahrain, my baggage is missing in action. Upon filing a missing baggage report, I am advised that Fly Dubai does not provide a per diem allowance to cover essentials while baggage is tracked. Later I am advised that there is another Fly Dubai flight in another three hours and it may be on that flight. But, no, that is still not sufficient time for the airline to resolve the issue. Finally, it arrives via Gulf Air (Thank you for stepping up to the plate where Fly Dubai fails dramatically). Only to be told I should return to the airport to collect it myself as Fly Dubai, as a low budget carrier service does not offer such service. Really. Maybe you should check my passenger record that I am incapacitated due to two surgeries on my foot and require a wheel chair. Great service you offer. Low budget - ticket prices was similar to that of full service airline, Turkish Airlines, but flydubai presented the shortest time (or so I thought) between point to point. Maybe flydubai CEO does not realize the level of service that is being provided and never studied marketing that the cost of losing one customer is equivalent of capturing ten new customers. Thank you to my hotel guest services, Golden Tulip Bahrain has picked up the ball where it was dropped by Fly Dubai.

### "very happy with the flight"
Colombo to Dubai. I was very happy with the flight. Everything had to be  - from entertainment to food and drinks. On a 5hr night flight the food and beverage cart only came out once. The crew seem friendly and was active in the cabin with the call bells. The aircraft was clean and everything seemed to work well.

### "just another reason not to flyDubai"
Dubai to Doha. Don't bother paying for a "free to change" ticket for twice the normal price. When I presented at the ticket office in Dubai airport I was advised the fare change cost on a free to change ticket was 420 Durham, more than twice the cost of the discounted fare and about the same price as the "free to change" fare I first paid. After some negotiations a 200 Durham fare was paid - making a total fee of around 600. Confused? Don't be - just another reason not to flyDubai and another scam. Add it to buying a legroom seat and not getting it either.

### "worst ever flight experience"
The worst ever flight experience. It is a budget airline, but its not cheap either. My return flight from Doha to Dubai was scheduled to depart at 18.05. First they announced that there is a 30 minutes delay, this was after standing the boarding queue for 20 mins. Until 18.45, there was no announcement or nothing from them. They started boarding again by 18.50, and send some people in the flight. They stopped the boarding once more and said no more people will be taken inside the flight. They gave weird reasons saying the air pressure in the flight is too high, so they will not take anymore people. And asked the rest of us to take the flight which departs at 20.20. So there was a 2.15 hours delay in the airport. The worst is yet to come as the AC was not working in the flight they made us sit after 2.15 hours of delay. Flight was supposed to take off at 20.20 and it took off at 20.45.

### "was delayed for a long time"
Doha to Dubai. FlyDubai was very easy to book via a responsive and stable web site. Flight choices were vast for the route and the fare cheap - amazingly cheap. But sadly you get what you pay for. My travel was for work. The flight was delayed for a long time with no explanation offered. If time is important or reliability for a connection forget FlyDubai.

### "didn't show any courtesy"
I was on the business class by flydubai FZ442 on 7th August flying from Cochin to Dubai. They didn't supply any food and beverages during the flight (although it is mentioned on the ticket). Cabin service was very bad. The flight is delayed for 1.5 hours and when I travel Dubai to Dammam my baggage is missed and I complained at the help desk. Flydubai didn't show any courtesy to call me regarding the baggage. The next day I chased with the Airport and got the luggage back. Very poor service.

### "wanted my seat I paid for"
Dubai to Amman. I paid for a seat with legroom plus flight insurance since I kept hearing bad reviews about the airline. Boarding the plane I realized that a family is occupying my reserved seat and the host tried to solve the issue which seemed to be a reservation conflict caused by flydubai. This happened with another passenger who is supposed to sit beside me. Anyway the family seemed like they refused to move and I asked the host to find a similar seat with legroom. He came back to say thay he found one and I didn't mind. Few minutes later he came back to apologize that it's not possible, at this moment I was so annoyed and told him politely that this is not acceptable. Anyway they tried there best to find a convenient seat without hope. The flight was late 30 min because of this mistake as they couldn't find a solution. The business class was half empty but they refused to give a seat there although this could have solved the problem. The passengers got mad and the captain was shouting on the crew to solve the issue. The worse part was when the passengers inquired about the reason of delay and the staff marked that I am causing the delay! So now it's my mistake. I had no idea the flight was delayed that long because of me. Once I heard that from the host I asked one of the passengers who was arguing with the host if I am the cause of the delay and replied "this is what the staff claim". If I am the reason i will have to take any seat rather that causing delay to everyone. They said no sir the seat is available and the seat was cleared a while ago but didn't know what were they waiting for. The crew were professional and kind and offered me free service and dinner. But I refused this kindness I wanted my seat I paid for that's it.

### "they will start to look for it"
Prague to Muscat return via Dubai with flydubai. All 4 flights delayed. They lost my stroller. I was assured that the stroller will be sent to my hotel. Nothing happened. The stroller was on the Airport 4 hours after my arrival, but after 6 days flydubai wrote me, that they will start to look for it. I had to go to the airport on my own. I asked for any compensation, but without any answer.

### "seats comfortable, legroom good"
Kuwait to Dubai and this was my first time flying with flydubai. The seats were comfortable. Legroom were good for a short flight. Food is not provided but you can purchase inflight but I bought it from the airport. Cabin crew were ok. Inflight entertainment was good but most of the movies weren't free, you have to buy them. Flight was on-time and I liked the mood lights - I recommend.

### "crew were very friendly"
I flew flydubai economy class on my way back to Sofia from Dubai. It was very nice. The seat was very comfortable and crew were very friendly. The food was excellent. One thing I don't like about the airline is that it flies from Terminal 2 in Dubai and that you have to buy extra food on board.

### "crew very attentive and friendly"
An afternoon flight Tehran to Dubai with flydubai was a pleasant experience. I was very impressed. We departed and arrived on time and the price for this trip was excellent. Very comfortable seat, but they have no bassinet services for infants. Crew very attentive and friendly. Meal was delicious. Inflight entertainment was very good.

### "wasn't a pleasant experience"
Doha to Dubai with flydubai and I had a lot of expectations especially with regards to the product that is marketed. The crew were not one of the best in terms of service except for one. It was an all economy plane which is mostly used for GCC or Indian Sub Con sectors and I happened to fly that aircraft. I would like to try the product which I see in the ads every time and I'm sure I would like that. But based on this particular flight, it wasn't a pleasant experience at all.

### "ticket is very affordable"
Prague to Dubai with Flydubai. Even though the airline is considered to be lowcost, on flights from Prague you get - one 20kg luggage, cabin bag, and food is included. The price of the ticket is very affordable. The food is very good, but for the drinks you get only one small water for free. The cabin staff are ok, legroom is standard for a Boeing 737 but too small for this 6 hour flight.

### "my preferred choice nowadays"
flydubai is a low cost although depending on the destination not so low cost. But it's the only no frills airline that has individual entertainment monitor on each seat. I think it's the only low cost with such a perk and it's quite unique for its category. Flew Bahrain to Dubai. Rarely on this airline have I had flight delays. T2 in Dubai has been totally renewed and it's now a jewel. Good thing compared to other terminals, it's much faster to get out from airport. Overall it's good value for money for most destination and it's my preferred choice nowadays. One small suggestion. I have once purchased the food tray and food was quite average. While sandwiches are decent.

### "prices can be expensive"
Kuwait to Dubai with FlyDubai. This airline is considered low cost but their prices can be more expensive than Emirates. The base fare is cheap but you have to pay for the baggage, seats, food and inflight entertainment system. If you don't want to pay for the baggage you can take 7kg for the carry on baggage, if you want to check baggage this will cost you more. When selecting seats I chose the first row which costs $26USD per person ($260USD total) - it is cheaper at the rear of the aircraft. Flight was on a Boeing 737-800 - the seats were dirty and not really comfortable. The windows were very dirty. The cabin crew service is poor and rude. The should really limit the pieces of carry on baggage because from Kuwait to Dubai the airplane was delayed due to an huge amount of baggage that won't fit in the lockers. In the end, the amount I paid for economy class was the same amount I would pay for business class. I would recommend Emirates over FlyDubai - prices are better and their aircraft are cleaner.

### "affect Flydubai reputation"
I flew with family of four adults and six months old baby on flydubai from Jeddah to Muscat through Dubai on 17th January 2016. My flight from Jeddah to Dubai was without any problem. Then we waited on transit for four hours as per schedule, after the boarding announcement to Muscat on gate F6, we were surprised the announcement did not mentioned families with childrens and elderly to board first. Anyway I took my family to the end of queue which was long, then one ground handling staff came to me and told me that families should move to another queue. He opened the new queue for us, suddenly the supervisor on gate F6 started shouting to me and told me that Flydubai doesn't have a rule for families with childrens and eldery passengers to board first. Then all passengers on the queue tried to convince him to let me and other families passengers with childrens to board first, but he kept shouting until one passenger let me board before him. This type of customer service for sure will affect Flydubai reputation.

### "the absolute worst"
flydubai from Doha to Amman was the absolute worst. No leg room (and I am short), flight attendants were rude and insensitive. My blood pressure happen to drop at one point during the flight, and I asked for some water - the flight attendant got upset and did not bring me the water. A co-worker I was flying with, sat on a vacant seat nearby to give me more room to lay a little more comfortably, and she was scolded for not occupying her own seat. An airline that is not able to provide even a small cup half full of water for an ailing passenger is the worst.

### "just don't care"
Avoid if possible. flydubai cancelled my Dubai to Khartoum flight without any explanation or apology a couple of days before Christmas, resulting in an 18 hour layover. I requested that they at least pay for a hotel room. The only way to contact them is via an email, but they did not respond, and did not offer to compensate me for the hotel room. I based the start of my trip around the timing of the cancelled flight. They obviously feel as if they have a monopoly, and just don't care.

### "avoid travelling again"
flydubai from Tehran to Dubai. Very disappointed. Flight was 4+ hours late and staff gave us no information or assurance. Captain didn't explain reason for delay or offer apology. Rather unprofessional. Staff on board were courteous and helpful and the plane was clean. But will probably avoid travelling again because they don't take their customers seriously.

### "seats extremely uncomfortable"
Riyadh to Mineralnye Vody via Dubai. I had the misfortune of having to fly with this airline since its the only one that went to the destination I required from Dubai. On both legs of the journey, the seats were extremely uncomfortable - plastic with a thin layer of fabric at an awkward angle. Having to pay extra fees for basic feature such as seat allocation, food or in-flight entertainment adds insult to injury. The flydubai terminal in Dubai is hideous - most phone charger sockets don't work and the atmosphere is miserable - not what one would expect from a world-class airport in a modern country. To make the experience even worse, my baggage did not arrive at my final destination in Russia despite being assured it would be transferred (since we used FlyDubai for both legs of the journey, this should not have been an issue). They told me I need to wait 4 days for the next flight to come and we need to collect it from the airport because they have no agreement for which to deliver it - which is a 3 hour drive through icy dangerous conditions. And our warm clothing is in those suitcases! If you can avoid them, do so.

### "never fly them again"
Dubai to Colombo return. The seats are small compared to other economy cabin seats. No recline and leg room. Both flights delayed. Terminal 2 lacks basic facilities and below average. - Limited overpriced snacks and meals onboard for purchase. -IFE kept freezing. (paid additional) I will never fly them again.

### "no service and staff rude"
flydubai is a terrible airline. Shabby Boeing 737 from DXB to AMM, no service and staff rude. The lines in Terminal 2 in Dubai are appalling and take forever, some 15 counters, only 5 working during rush hours. I chose them not for the price but I wanted to try something fresh - huge mistake, flight delayed by an hour and still no apologies. I will never fly flydubai again.

### "avoid them in the future"
Dubai to Delhi on flydubai, and a rude and mediocre service. They are not as cheap as other airlines on the region but still I decided to try them, a very poor decision, pay per everything as they are a low cost airline. Dubai Terminal 2 is dirty and lacks the basics. Before boarding there was one staff said my ticket is not genuine because I booked by third party (cleartrip) - I missed the option of baggage during ticket booking, but afterwards I tried to contact airline customer care and they put me on hold for 35 mins and still never responded. I tried to find out any solution for my baggage but no support from staff and I had to pay for baggage AED678 - my ticket price was less than this. On top on this, they offer IFE seat screens but they charge you to watch it! Seat seems very small as well. I was really disappointed by flydubai and will do my best to avoid them in the future.

### "a very positive experience"
Dubai to Beirut with flydubai. I was worried after reading several conflicting experiences about flydubai, however booked on them dues to the affordable price for the business seats and convenience of flight time, having flown this leg I was pleasantly surprised of the positive experience I had. Business class was almost identical to a major airline, from own counter to a lounge, separate boarding bus and very convenient seats. Plane was new, entertainment with latest movies releases, etc. Good blankets. Flight attendants not too caring but it was more than enough for a low cost, and better than low cost airlines attendants who usually try to push lottery tickets and duty free items all flights long. The Captain and first officer were very communicative and informed us several times on flight updates, turbulences etc. Flight was on time for takeoff and landing. All in all a very positive experience from a low cost.

### "really disappointed by flydubai"
Dubai to Doha, and Bahrain to Amman. Horrendous airline, a very rude and mediocre service. They are not as cheap as other airlines on the region but still I decided to try them, a very poor decision, flights often delayed, pay per everything as they are a "low cost" airline. The terminal used, Terminal 2 is dirty and lacks the basics. Ground staff don't know how to check visa requirements properly. Before boarding there was one staff aggressively checking documents. Onboard the cabin crew are indifferent and rush the service in order to be free to chat on the galley. I was really disappointed by flydubai and will do my best to avoid them in the future.

### "experience entirely positive"
My flight was from Dubai to Juba, and 5 hrs 40 mins is far longer than I like to spend in a Boeing 737-800 on a low cost airline. However, my flydubai experience was entirely positive. Terminal 2 at Dubai is clean and functional, visual and audible information was quite clear. It does take rather a long time to transfer from the other DXB terminals, and I would recommend a minimum of 3 hours between flights. The aircraft cabin was clean, staff polite and a snack/meal was served for free outbound and return. Outbound and return flights departed and arrived on time, and my checked bag made it safely from and to the UK, despite Juba having a small provincial airport suddenly pitched into capital city status. Full marks on this occasion.

### "emotional distress this caused"
I arrived with my travel partner 2.5 hours before our flydubai flight with roughly 50kg of baggage. I did not know that baggage allowance had to be purchased 4 hours before the flight since I had never flown the airline and I had purchase my ticket through Kayak, which didn't clearly state this information. The cost for our baggage since we didn't pre-purchase equated to about $500 USD. When I tried to have this reduced, the manager on site only said he would wave 10KG of cost or about $100 of the $500. I asked to speak with another manager and I went to another back office where I spoke to an operations manager who said he couldn't help me. When I came back to the check-in, the manager said he would no longer provide the 10kg allowance since it wasn't good enough for me originally. To attempt to reduce our luggage weight, the airline people told us to buy small bags from the gift shop and fill them with luggage to carry on rather than simply wave a portion of the fee since we didn't have carry-ons. We did so and almost missed our flight because at the security checkpoint they said we had too many items and had to pay to check one of the carry ons. I ended up paying $382 in luggage fees and $70 to purchase new bags and threw away one of our used suitcases all because the airline was unwilling to provide some grace on their policy and because the arrogant manager preferred to watch us sweat, panic, and almost miss our flight rather than just be a man of his original word and provide the 10kg of grace he originally offered. I can't begin to put into words the emotional distress this situation caused me and my travel partner and it even ruined the next 24 hours of my "vacation". This is absolutely no way to run a customer business.

### "gave me the wrong seat"
Tried flydubai from Bahrain to Dubai after a long time. This time their online check in gave me the wrong seat. This has happened to me before with them. Once it does, nobody can sort it out until you go to the airport, which negates the whole point of having an online check in.

### "go out of my way not to use flydubai again"
I will go out of my way not to use flydubai again. The leg room is very poor, and no free services. If you like to pay for drinks or food then this is your airline. No free on board entertainment. They have duty free if you want. The flight attendants spent more time chatting among themselves and tending to their luggage then the passengers who pay their salaries. This is a cheap no frills airline!

### "first time with flydubai will be my last"
My first time with flydubai on 20 Sept will be my last. The tickets are cheap at the start, then flydubai charge you for carry on bags, seat assignment, and in flight entertainment etc. On my flight back from Dubai to Kuwait I had no bags to check in, my flight was due to leave within 45 mins and the check in staff for 30 mins tried to explain to me that I had to purchase another ticket because I was 15 min late. Needless to say I purchased the ticket, and informed them that I was not happy with the service I was provided. My only conclusion is that since flights are not full they make up excuses to make passengers buy additional tickets.

### flydubai customer review
Flew HBE-DXB return. Outbound, in July was during Ramadan, typically a low season for FZ out of Alexandria. Check-in agents at HBE not particularly efficient or polite, but given the low loads (I think this flight must have had like 30 passengers onboard) this was not an issue. The flight itself was uneventful, as most everyone went to sleep and abstained from eating/drinking. Did not see cabin crew perform a drink run, nor was in-flight entertainment started. Flight comfortable as I got to stretch out. Return flight was busier, but with plenty of empty seats. Cabin crew friendly and attentive, and were selling drinks and sandwiches/snacks. FlyDubai operates 3-4 daily roundtrips on the route, so plenty of flights to choose from. Once you're done adding extras (bags, extra legroom seats) ticket price goes up a bit, but you definitely get what you pay for. FZ is my only choice on this route, and much more preferable to Egyptair's own nonstop.

### flydubai customer review
My family and I (2 adults, 1 child) had purchased my tickets to DXB-SAL-DXB and at the same time, had paid additional so that I could select my seats. On entering the flight, we noticed that someone was already seated on our pre-purchased seats, which was 8D, 8E and 8F. We contacted the stewardess and told her of the issue. She asked us to temporarily sit on one of the vacant seats while she gets things sorted out. My wife and child were seated on empty seats while I was standing waiting for the issue to be resolved as passengers entered and took our seats. Finally, the stewardess came and told us that we could be seated at seats 30A, 30B and 30C. Furthermore, people who were assigned to those seats were moved to the front of the flight at random seats. This ended up being a problem for them as they had to wait till most of the passengers had disembarked from the flight so that they could move to the back of the plane to collect their luggage from the overhead cabins, where it was initially stored. I understand under normal circumstances whereby the seats were randomly assigned to us. However, these were paid seats and instead of seating the people who had taken our seats to their respective seats, we were pushed all the way to the back of the flight. This is unacceptable and I do not see any reason why an organization of this repute would agree to such a policy. Secondly, there was no explanation or request on the stewardesses part - she just told us those were the seats she had allocated for us. The flight itself was satisfactory. Seats were a little tight, and the touch screen display facing my seat was not working.

### flydubai customer review
I traveled from Dubai to Chennai round-trip. On time departure and arrival. Very nice and new aircraft's with good interior and pleasant to fly. Service was good and I will travel with them again.

### flydubai customer review
I was scheduled to fly from Kathmandu to Colombo via Dubai, when my flight was suddenly cancelled by FlyDubai due to the earthquake in Nepal (the earthquake was 2 weeks prior.) Flydubai made minimal effort to contact me, and offered only a voucher, no refund despite being the ones who cancelled the flight. I was stranded in Kathmandu, and flydubai did not provide me any goodwill whatsoever. My fiance had a hellish time trying to speak with the customer agents on my behalf, and they do not have a toll free number so the cost to do so was on our dime. I can't believe that any company would strand someone in a natural disaster and make such little effort. I'd rather pay a bit extra than ever fly with them again.

### flydubai customer review
FZ250 Tabriz to Dubai last min booked on this flight plane arrived TBZ 15-20 mins earlier and boarded pax as early as their staff could. Probably due to ATC our flight closed door earlier than schedule but still managed to take off just in time at 0410. Total pax onboard was about 40-50s on this brand new 737-800 very nice interior with mood lighting dimmed as blue ceiling light and when approaching it dim as amber. I love this very much. Check in was fast didn't pay for any seat allocation but the check in staff gave me 8A the 3rd row from the front in the economy section. Business class was totally empty on this flight. Probably due to late night departure and this is a new launched service for Fly Dubai. Overall it was a pleasant flight as I could occupy all 3 seats during the flight.

### flydubai customer review
We flew between Tehran and Dubai together with my spouse and our 8 month infant. The plane was a Boeing 727-800 with very tight spaces between the seats uncomfortable to hold the baby. I asked for the first row of economy class seats 5A to F but the check in lady in Dubai surprisingly asked for some 150 AED extra charge for each seat which we denied. Furthermore the heat dissipation of the LCD monitors even when they were off was awful the air conditioner couldn't handle it. The last not the least was the baggage allowance for each passenger which is regularly 20 kg and we had to pay about 50$ to buy an extra 20 kg to cover our requirement. Although some airlines like FlyDubai put limitations on their services to provide more economical tickets I guess with using bus to take the passengers to the plane or eliminating catering FlyDubai couldn't deduct the price in the competition market to give appealing offers. Considering the above points I will try not to employ their services again particularly when the baby is involved.

### flydubai customer review
I flew DXB-DOH and on the same day DOH-DXB back. Of course you can't expect a service like from Qatar Airways or Emirates which both operate this route. But the price is just great. Because it was a short-haul flight we were allowed to use the inflight-entertainment system for free. Food and drinks are for purchase but its a no-frills airline. The Inflight entertainment was as I said complimentary on this flight. We had a personal inflight TV in our seat and a huge collection of movies in many languages. I was able to watch movies in German. I would absolutely recommend this airline!

### flydubai customer review
DOH-DXB-DOH. Fly this route weekly. Amazing consistency. Flights on time. Easy boarding. Use a bus to terminal in DXB and DOH which means buying seats at the front is pointless. New planes. Widescreen IFE which is free on this short sector and works before takeoff and after landing. IFE costs $10 otherwise for unlimited movies and shows or $4 for shows only. Legroom is very cramped but is acceptable for short haul flights. Note there is a fast bag desk at DXB but is not very visible.

### flydubai customer review
KWI-DXB return. Good value nice clean aircraft. And they avoid the main terminals - a major bonus at KWI where the main terminal is terrible.

### flydubai customer review
My first experience with FlyDubai was okay better than I expected based on what I read. I found my two flights DXB-TBS-DXB on time and in very nice looking planes. Staff were crisp and friendly but the seats were far too close to each other. When the passenger in front put his seat back the IFE monitor nearly took my teeth out! Not to mention the monitor screen is very hot and on both my flights the AC in the plane was about the temp to roast chickens. And you had to pay for everything except for a small cup of water. I know it is a low cost airline but I have never had to pay for weak coffee before. The IFE was very basic unless you forked up about 15 AED for basic service.

### flydubai customer review
Flydubai to and from Port Sudan. Both flights were exactly on time with no issues. Planes appeared new and clean. No check-in queue at all in Dubai but Port Sudan was a bit of a mess with waits up to an hour. Prepaid baggage extra legroom seats and meals were all provided without issue. IFE gave free flight status and map everything else required payment so not sure of it's value. Very long bus ride back to DXB immigration (~15 minutes) but virtually no queue at immigration. T2 facilities basic but adequate.

### flydubai customer review
I have to use it often as I go back home always every weekend. They average 1 hour delay Cabin staff are usually fine but the ground staff is terminal 2 are awful. They are never on time out of 30+ trip I did FlyDubai was on time probably twice or 3 times.

### flydubai customer review
Business class Dubai to Kuwait. Check in counters for business barricaded with no representative around to open and assist. Upon asking around one person did come out. Check in agent was friendly and efficient. No business agent per say as advertised. Lounge in T2 even though its new was over crowded. If flydubai expects to operate a dedicated business class in all its flights in the future they will have a problem as the lounge area is very small - both the bar and buffet area in addition to this since its a marhaba lounge most of the credit cards guests are also welcomed. Boarding was with economy class onboard a dedicated crew member who was efficient and friendly. Seat good for short hops better than European low cost business class who block the middle seat. Dinner service only a cold sandwich and a desert on a tray which when compared to emirates airlines catering for the same sector in economy is much better but here your paying for J in a low cost carrier.

### flydubai customer review
My wife and I flew from Bucharest to Colombo and return with a stop in Dubai. On the first Segment Bucharest - Dubai the plane was delayed by 1 hour. In Dubai on segment 2 another 2 hours. But as long as the flight is not delayed by 5+ hours I don't think this is a major problem. On return from Colombo segments 3 and 4 were on time not even 1 min delay. All 4 segments were operated by 737-800 next gen Sky interior new planes. Happy with legroom and space between seats. I knew from the beginning that it's a Low Cost Airline and I had to pay for all services. It was my choice to fly with them and I'm very happy. The crew from all 4 segments was very polite and ready to answer all questions. The only thing I didn't like was the payment process on board. If you pay with Euro they will give you change in AED. Same for US Dollars. And you will have to pay 8 AED for a water if you pay with Euro.

### flydubai customer review
My wife and I took 2 flights with Fly Dubai - Dubai to Amman return. Onboard issues: legroom won't be an issue if you are shorter than 6' (which I'm not) yes I understand the business model is a low-cost carrier but paying for water? The IFE is useless unless you want to watch the flight map so be prepared to pay for any sort of entertainment. My main concern with Fly Dubai however is that both flights were each over 1 hour late. Having reviewed some forums about Fly Dubai this seems to be a trend of theirs. What made this worse is that our return flight was followed by an international connection and in addition to the unexplained 1 hour delay our checked bags took 1 hour to come out. We came within minutes of missing our connection so beware if you have a connection and a Fly Dubai flight is involved - you'd better consider giving yourself more than enough time in between flights to account for their unreliability of avoid them altogether.

### flydubai customer review
Dubai to Doha. Flight was terrible. The mostly young crew was the loudest most obnoxious crew I've ever come across in 30 years of travel. They spent the entire flight loudly laughing and exchanging jokes among themselves in the galley disturbing the passengers. To make matters worse one very irritating female flight attendant was criticizing some passengers (using curse words) not caring whether anyone heard her or not. Her behavior is simply unacceptable. Never ever again.

### flydubai customer review
My wife and I boarded a Flydubai flight when she was 7 months pregnant (which is allowed by all international airlines and she had the necessary doctor papers to take this flight). To cut a long story short the ground staff of Flydubai refused to give us the seats we paid 200 AED extras for. That was fine (security always takes priority) but they refused also to give us alternative seats suitable for a pregnant woman gave us ad-hoc seats totally unsuitable for pregnancy and separated us on top of this. Staff used an inappropriate tone. On board things were not much better and the offensive tone staff used made even other passengers take our defence. We finally managed to get appropriate seats thanks to other passengers. To ad to this the pre-purchased meal we ordered and paid for was not available on the plane.

### flydubai customer review
Dubai - Kathmandu return. Both flights delayed by an hour and very busy. Outbound agents at the gate wisely checked in lots of hand luggage into the hold (for free) due to minimal storage space onboard. Outbound flight had no IFE and was disappointed with no inflight magazine (but then they have taken out the seat pockets so there would be nowhere to put it anyway!). Return flight was on a brand new brilliant B737 with personal IFE and mood lighting. Excellent crew who handled a medical emergency well and all were very engaging with passengers - really good to see. Transfer to T3 to connect with Emirates was smooth although distances are long so it takes time. Had to collect boarding pass in DXB which wasn't the case when checking in out the inbound - be good to resolve this - although reassuring that he baggage tickets were scanned and confirmed and all arrived at final destination.

### flydubai customer review
Overall I was impressed with the efficiency and professionalism of FlyDubai and staff. Several negatives stand out however that fellow travelers should pay attention to. First you need to understand the business model requires paying extra for everything. Your assigned seat any checked luggage water or food on the flight inflight entertainment - you name it. The first flight I was on had no video onboard not even screens on the center aisle. Second the return flight had video but the quality of the touch screens was so poor and unmanageable that I was not even tempted to watch a movie for fear of it being messed up. I noticed very few people watching movies on the screen - instead they read or watched movies on the tablets. I also noticed that the flight staff struggled to get the touch screens they used to work. They had to keep touching them to get it to respond. They really should fix that. The flight staff were professional but only one of the two stewardesses was friendly. Thirdly the return flight was delayed one hour with no explanation from the rather unfriendly ground crew who were running the door. As a result we got into Dubai 40 minutes late - and then we had to wait 30 minutes to get our luggage after getting through passport control! This was very frustrating at the end of a long day especially as there is no excuse for this is a modern airport. I don't think I will fly the airline again because on top of this I had to pay AED 640 for my car to be parked for 5 days in long term parking. Coming from Abu Dhabi to Dubai I would have been better to take a cab. This is not the airlines fault but fellow travelers would do well to be aware of this one.

### flydubai customer review
FlyDubai to Colombo September 2013: Their home base Terminal 2 in Dubai in my opinion is unpleasant inconvenient and facilities are lacking. Secondly what's with the 3 hour check-in requirement? The check-in took forever - our agent was really slow. The aircraft are admittedly smallish but then again its a 737 and not a 777 or A380 so its to be expected. Interior was clean and in a good state of repair. The F/As in my opinion had a more natural and genuinely friendly demeanour compared to Emirates' crew. Perhaps because the FlyDubai crew were quite young. They seemed to enjoy their jobs. Legroom was fine for me as I am not that tall. F/A service was adequate and quite prompt. Food purchased from the menu was not bad at all for a low cost airline. Alcohol is overpriced at AED 40 for a whisky. The 737 is obviously not the fastest plane versus the 777 for instance so I found the duration of the trip to be a little more tiresome as a result. I will fly FlyDubai again but only for family trips and only in their new business class offering.

Dubai to Beirut 8/08/2013. Flight supposed to depart at 8am but as we were about to take-off a medical emergency delayed the plane for almost 2 hours. Even though the flight attendants were apologetic the captain didn't bother once to speak to passengers or tell us what was going on. During the 2 hours delay we were left in the plane with no air-conditioning of any kind. Passengers began to get agitated and tempers frayed. Only after many passengers began to complain loudly that we were allowed to board buses to wait until the situation was dealt with. I have to admit that the flight attendants were professional and were doing their best to deal with a serious situation but shame on the captain for not once bothering to tell us what was being done. I will fly with them again since they offer good fares and connections but their pilots should be better trained.

CMB-DXB. As a Brit I had reservations about flying with a low cost airline for those of you reading this from Europe you will be aware what low cost actually means. The competitors such as EZY/RYR are awful and I was expecting a similar experience. The pre sales experience was not good however when I checked in at the airport the crew were lovely moving our pre booked seats to better locations on the aircraft. Check-in staff seemed strict with baggage rules thankfully we were under our baggage limits are paying only 40AED to purchase an extra 10KG! Anyway boarded the aircraft and it was amazing. Brand new Boeing mood lighting specious comfortable lovely crew brilliant service on time! Would recommend FlyDubai to anyone!

SKT-DXB-SKT. Flight to Dubai: FZ 338 20 May 05.45. Return to Sialkot: FZ 337 24 May 00.30. My overall my experience with Fly Dubai was great. Plane was very good but not spacious. Crew co-operative and friendly. Overall journey was very nice except couple of things as I mentioned before. They shouldn't apply charges for at least a cup of tea/coffee soft drink water etc. Would recommend if the seating was wider and there were no entertainment charges. Overall a nice journey with Fly Dubai.

### flydubai customer review
The Ryanair of the Middle East. Last week flew KWI-DXB-MCT return. My knees have still not recovered from the totally inadequate legroom and seat pitch as well as the incredibly badly-designed Recaro seats which had Phillips-head screws mounted exactly where one's knees meet the seatbacks. The planes were clean and are not covered with tacky advertising but literally everything on board - even water - costs extra. The personnel onboard varies on the KWI-DXB leg the cabin attendants were extremely strict in their enforcement of seat-backs in the upright position for take-off whereas on other legs they were not really interested in coming out of the galley at all. One flight used a 737-800 without any entertainment system all others had the in-seat screens but except for the in-flight map everything else costs extra. Duty-free service is wildly overpriced. DXB airport's terminal 2 the "home" of FlyDubai has some of the filthiest restrooms I have seen. Never again.

We booked an indirect flight from Doha to Beirut and one stop in Dubai. Flight Doha to Dubai was delayed and they didn't inform us properly. FlyDubai manager confirmed that once we arrived in Dubai the second flight would be available as per our booking. Unfortunately our flight took off and we had to sleep with our child in Dubai airport for 8 hours. Definitely will not booked again.

Kathmandu-Dubai en route to JFK back and forth. I have nothing positive to say about the flight. The timing of the flight was changed 3 times. I had brought the ticket for a good transit time from Dubai which was changed making an 8 hour transit about 2 weeks prior to the flight. On arrival to the airport I was informed that the flight timing was again changed to the original time making me wait at Kathmandu Airport for another 4 hours for no reason. No prior information/emails or apologies were given. The cabin itself was too crowed with tiny seats crammed up in a small space. The air condition was not working and it was very hot and humid in the cabin with no help from the crew members on complaining regarding this problem. I was highly disappointed with Fly Dubai.

### flydubai customer review
My Kathmandu-Dubai flight was originally booked for 18.45. This was changed about a week before departure to 21.55. The night before this was changed again to 14.35. On arrival at the airport there were plenty of passengers all ready to check in for the 14.35. No FD staff were present and we heard the flight was delayed until 18.45. At 3 the gate finally opened and we were told there never was a 14.35 flight and our travel agents must have made a mistake - even though the departure time on our boarding passes was 14.35! Flight eventually took off an hour late. In the 7 hours wait no-one from FD offered an apology an explanation or even a cup of tea. Cabin crew refused to give us complimentary food. I will not use this airline again.

Belgrade-Dubai-Muscat on 2 Nov 2012. At the time of checking-in / boarding in Belgrade I was informed that my booked flight Dubai-Muscat was cancelled and I got a boarding pass for a later flight which was not acceptable. Informed that flight was cancelled due to ‘economic reasons’ (not enough passengers?). E-mail from Flydubai informing about my options sent too late. Upon arrival to Dubai airport there was nothing I could do had to purchase a ticket to Muscat for the first available flight much more expensive of course. Flydubai is not a ‘low cost’ company at all if you add baggage drinks terrible conditions at Flydubai building at Dubai airport etc. + high risk of cancellation you get almost the same price as any other ‘normal’ company.

The negative reviews of FlyDubai must have been written by people who have never flown Ryanair. Flight from Kabul to Dubai was on time. Aircraft brand new. Legroom excellent. Staff charming. Choice of food limited expensive but tasty enough. Best of all you can buy alcohol - which after a long dry spell in Afghanistan is a treat - even on a breakfast-time flight!

### flydubai customer review
Really disappointed! Flight from Kabul delayed by 6 hours and I missed connecting flight. Customer service at Dubai terminal 2 was non existent and I had to pay for new flight. I complained and they suggested I travel into Kabul to book with their agency. I made clear my company would not let me travel in Kabul due to the security risk. I received no reply after this. I will never travel with this company again and will find alternative airline even if the costs more.

### flydubai customer review
We flew from UAE to Turkey by another discount airline with our carry on luggage. Returning we flew FlyDubai. We shopped and accumulated check-in luggage - what a mistake. We tried to purchase the credit for this online and couldn't. Getting to the airport we were prepared to pay for this extra luggage. Then we learned what the 7kg rule is. They weighed my purse carry on luggage and this extra checked in luggage and then deducted the 7kg off to calculate my total cost for checked in luggage. The other airline didn't even look at my carry on luggage more less than weighed it. At a cost of 10Euros a kg this was absurd and a costly lesson flying FlyDubai. It didn't help that the staff behind the desk couldn't explain the situation.

Erbil/Arbil to Dubai. Flight quite empty so lots of space however seating would have been quite comfortable even if the flight had been fuller - I had less legroom on much more renowned carriers (as a 187 cm person). Clean aircraft cabin staff friendly seating comfortable in seat IFE - however films and music have to be paid for as do food and drinks (pricing acceptable). Nice additional benefit: arrival in Terminal 2 in DXB - no queues on immigration as compared to Terminal 1 so this is one very strong argument to fly flyDubai!

### flydubai customer review
Supposed to fly on FZ159 to Beirut at 6.45 pm flight delayed 40 min. When they announced boarding I went to the gate and stood in the queue. The board was showing Beirut FZ 159 final call. The queue did not move for almost 30 min when I reached the gate I was informed I was offloaded from the flight because I reported late to the gate. In fact the gate had started boarding another flight to Bahrain. When I explained to the Fly Dubai staff that I was waiting for 30 mins they simply neglected me and said nothing could be done. When I showed the board to the staff reading the Beirut flight they got confused and immediately changed it to Bahrain. The only way out of this was to buy another ticket and wait 5 hours at the airport to catch the next flight to Beirut that will land at 3 am. Terrible experience.

### flydubai customer review
I regularly use flydubai flying DXB-MCT-DXB sector and nearly all flights except one have been on time. Nearly all aircraft's now have the new AVOD system installed except for A6-FDX which is one of the older aircraft. Despite this I have found that some screens do not work unless you furiously tap on it and use some force and others simply do not work at all. The seats are comfortable with some recline though it would not matter on a short 45-50 min flight. The food is decent although a bit expensive. Inflight duty free is small but is as usual expensive. The crew are friendly and helpful. Recently however I have found that one aircraft has begun to show it's age with the plastic window cover breaking off exposing the insulation as well as the plastic cover of emergency exit light on the emergency exit wing door coming loose though this is something that maintenance department can easily repair.

### flydubai customer review
Have been using Flydubai for a year now on average 10 flights a month and in that time not one flight has departed on time and numerous flights cancelled. Everything about this airline falls short of recognised customer service levels nothing is geared towards customer needs - from the online portal check in to in flight service and punctuality.

### flydubai customer review
Very poor service. Flew from Kathmandu to Dubai. Even a glass of water had to be purchased. Lost a connecting flight to New York due to it's delay. Officials at Dubai airport don't take any complaints of the Dubai based airlines. Stranded in the airport for 24 hours. Very poor service of Fly Dubai.

### flydubai customer review
Flydubai is acceptable from Dubai to other destinations. I took flydubai every week for 4 months. During that time period flights are typically 30 minutes late. Ground staff and cabin crew are relatively friendly. It is inconvenient that they do not offer online check-in. But flydubai is absolutely horrible from Dammam to Dubai. The ground staff leave the check in counter one hour before the flight and there is absolutely no one to help you afterwards in the airport.

### flydubai customer review
Flew DXB to MCT and back same day. One flight on old 737 with no video. The return had the new cabin with nice video. I was surprised how early they were calling for last call as arrived 1.5 hours early and was marked last call. Was very nervous but had plenty of time and both flights were on time and about 90% full. I bought the tickets one day before and it was still a great price. I was annoyed about paying for seat selection and glad I did not have any baggage. Beware to mark your baggage when you book as saw lots of people unhappy at check in having to pay extra. Overall fine for low cost carrier.

### flydubai customer review
What to say? The earlier flight to Kabul was canceled due to sandstorms but we only knew after they call us all for boarding only 3 minutes later when in the queue we were told to sit back as there were delays. Only persons chasing the staff found out about the cancellation and then in order to leave the airport they took all 120 passports and disappeared for 4 hours while the visa was cancelled with no further information to passengers. The poor information along with the staff hiding behind a cop who was the one giving the answers yelling at us and almost arresting a couple passengers that were complaining (In Dubai foreigners don't have the right to protest or demonstrate) proved they take advantage of it in order to skip passenger's complaints. Once in the aircraft next day the plane turns into a bazaar. Everything is to pay for including inflight entertainment. You can pay to have something else than the news scroll such as some TV series and pay more to access the movies. The plane was clean the seats very unconfortable.

### flydubai customer review
Doha to Amman via Dubai. Terrible experience from start to finish. Flights late on both legs. Harried and rude staff at Dubai airport. One has to pay for everything on board including water! Not as cheap as other low carriers and yet offer much less than most of them. Never again.

### flydubai customer review
DXB-MCT. A rather disappointing experience as the flight ended up departing 5 hours behind schedule. There was no real reason given and no flydubai staff were available for information once inside the departure terminal. The flight itself was fine once it departed and the cabin crew were courteous. For the difference in fare I would consider flying with a standard airline which treat passengers better in the event of long delays.

### flydubai customer review
BAH-DXB-BAH. Great value for money and not bad timing. BAH-DXB the seats were so bad I couldn't recline mine. No kind of display with any information or moving maps. DXB-BAH. This trip was much better better leg room PTVs for each passenger. I would fly it again but not on a journey of more than 2 hours.

### flydubai customer review
DXB-KTM on 737NG. Both flights on time. Service on both outbound and inbound was fantastic. Moderate amount of seat space and legroom. Did not have any inflight entertainment onboard this journey seems like only selected aircrafts have them. FA's very attentive and friendly. No complaints with this new low cost carrier.

### flydubai customer review
MUC-DXB last week. Flight was actually pretty good - decent aircraft good communications from the cockpit about waiting time to land at a congested DXB. The problem was the absolutely terrible attitude of the gate staff at Muscat airport. He turned up just a few minutes before departure time with most passengers standing there wondering what was going on. Far from explaining or apologizing he was simply rude to the passenger in front of me who enquired about the delay then snatched the boarding passing out of my hand without a word.

### flydubai customer review
Good ground support onboard roomy leg space well-behaved flight attendants etc. even though it's a budget airline. Flights were delayed on EVN-DXB-LKO route but the return was smooth. I would highly recommend using their service to people who knows what they pay for and keep their expectations accordingly.

### flydubai customer review
DXB-DOH-DXB. Check-in in DXB acceptable but flight to DOH was horrible. Boarding chaotic seats very poor but okay for a short trip on a LCC. FA terrible and unable to control any aspects of his flight. Passengers very rude and disobeying any announcements eg. turning off phones etc. People were talking in their phones during taxiing and take off and FA saw this but could not care less. Return was even worse. Check-in beyond words. Check-in staff looks at you while standing in line but even when it is your turn they looked away and would not offer to check in. I actually had to ask them several times if the would be so kind as to check me in. Again FA completely unable to control passengers. I asked FA to address or handle the situation regarding phone calls passengers directly acting rude towards other passengers but only to get yelled at. I guess it is more important to yell at people feeling unsafe because of other passengers who do not comply with safety standards than handling the situation correctly.

### flydubai customer review
AMM-DXB. The check-in was very fast the flight was 30 mins late. Aircraft B737-800 with AVOD and you pay for a movie the screens are not touch-sensitive so dealing with it was very difficult. Also too expensive for a low cost flight experience.

### flydubai customer review
IST-DXB. Transport to Sabiha airport has become easy with regular coaches. Not as cheap as other low cost airlines. Flight departed on time. Noticed check-in counter was very picky with overweight baggage / hand luggage. Plane was a new 737-800 however only 25% of AVOD screens were functioning. Some did not switch on while others had lost their sensitivity to touch making them useless. Clean cabin and ok crew. Too expensive for a low-cost airline.

### flydubai customer review
Customer service is non-existent. On both our outgoing and return trip all flights were changed and/or cancelled. A 5 hr layover became 10 hrs on our outward journey. No accommodation made for this layover. Our return flight was cancelled and when we phoned to make alternate arrangements we were lied to by staff who told us we had already agreed to a change some days prior which was false. The next day we spent 5 hrs at the airport before flying. Upon our arrival in Dubai we were had missed our connecting flight by 20 mins and had a 13 hr layover. It took 5 hrs before we were put up at a local hotel. There was never any apology nor admittance on behalf of flydubai that they were at any time in the wrong. The $200 we saved did not cover the hours in airports nor the stress created by the last minute change in flights.

### flydubai customer review
DXB-CMB-DXB on next generation 737. All flights were on time and crew friendly. Dubai check-in staff released emergency exit seats without payment which was added bonus. New 737 was impressive much larger overhead storage facility and new seats were quite comfortable. AVOD system was interesting you paid per movie/programme you watched via credit card or cash to crew. The buy onboard menu was also loaded onto the system and you could order food via the AVOD which was then delivered to your seat. Over all a pleasant flight and would use again.

DXB-HBE on 737-900. Flight was nice and cabin crew friendly. Seat was fine and the flight landed and leave on time.

### flydubai customer review
Did a connecting flight with FlyDubai recently from Doha-Beirut via Dubai Terminal 2. Once we reached Dubai Terminal 2 the transit passengers have to wait at the so called transit hall ( just an empty area with few seats next to the immigration check ) and wait for the announcement being made to their onwards destination only then are the passengers are allowed to enter the departure hall. No facilities provided at the 'transit hall' apart from one vending machine and few seats which obviously have been taken by other connecting passengers. The connecting passengers comfort is something that FlyDubai have to look into. Other than that the flight was ok. Crews were attentive cheap food onboard and there's IFE at every seat.

### flydubai customer review
Flydubai has become terribly unreliable. Same experience as previous comment; we booked our flights to Istanbul in Feb they rescheduled in March and then changed our flights again 2 days before our rescheduled flight. We suffered lot of anxiety and incurred penalties due to changes of our tour itinerary in Turkey. You are better off booking with other airlines when you have connecting flights.

### flydubai customer review
I've lost all my confidence on Flydubai an airline that keeps changing its flights. I booked DXB-SAW-DXB and paid in full. On 17 Mar they sent me a message saying my outbound flight had been cancelled and my inbound flight had been pushed back 11 hours due to a schedule change. They have no cash refund policy so there is no way I can get my money back - only a flydubai voucher which I am never going to use. For 1 week I struggle to change my travel plan paying penalties for changing hotels / car rental / flights and also for my travel companion who start from another country. I am finally ready to change my flight to accommodate their new schedule but there was a "system error" and they promised to call back within 24 hours. Today I called again and to my shock they now revert to the original schedule! I can change my plans all again but who knows when they will change again!

DXB-DOH-DXB Outbound on new 737-800 with AVOD IFE. Excellent system were you pay for what you want to watch. Short programs to full length movies cost between $2 - $7. Games and following flight path is free. Food onboard was adequate and reasonably priced. All flights arrived early and were 70% full. Leg room was quite tight but it is a low cost airlines. Dubai Terminal 2 is reasonable with a good variety of shops and restaurants. Cost was 30% of other airlines and definitely worth it.

### flydubai customer review
DXB-ALY return. Terminal 2 in Dubai is ok it became bigger since the last time I went there. Easy check-in and immigration process. Onboard reasonably priced food selection helpful FAs. Only confusing is that on our ticket it says we will land at HBE (Borg el Arab) surprising we arrived in ALY.

### flydubai customer review
DXB-DOH. Terminal 2 is fairly mundane compared to Terminals 1 or 3 at DXB but clean and less crowded. Check in lines were long for DOH check-in but walked over to a counter showing another check in city and the agent checked us in in minutes. Flight boarded by bus and was organized. B737-800 clean and comfortable flight attendants cordial and inflight food/shopping not over-priced.

### flydubai customer review
BEY-DXB return excellent value for money. New B737-800. Onboard sales for a reasonable price. In DXB they use T2 which is far from being welcoming. An inflight magazine would be ok on a 3hrs flight.

### flydubai customer review
DXB-DOH return on new 737-800. Short flights of 45 mins and no problems. Very quick through terminal 2 straight on to plane. Return also problem free bussed to plane in Doha which was at the furthest stand possible. Onboard crew friendly and efficient. Arrived back in Terminal two along with Mihin Lanka and Air India flight which meant long Queues at immigration however they moved quick enough and with no checked baggage I was in the taxi about 30 mins after landing!

### flydubai customer review
Recently flew DXB-BEY-DXB. All flights leave from Terminal two in Dubai which is across the airfield from Terminals one and three. There are few amenities in the terminal which is more likened to a Ryanair terminal than anything else. Cabin crew on both flights were friendly and on the out bound flight were extremely observent during safety checks insisting that all window blinds were up etc.Seat pitch quite small for a three hour flight and it was a low cost experience with drinks and snacks being sold on board - far cheaper than anything available on european LLC and they handed out a free cup of water after take off. On the return I asked to be moved from pre assigned seats to emergency exit seats the agent said he couldn't do it at the check in desk but to ask him at the gate. I did and he manually changed the seats for us. Exit seats were fantastic and allowed us to stretch out fully. A pleasant enough experience but would only fly with them if the fare was very good.
