### "Avoid Salam Air at all costs"
Traveling with Salam Air was an absolute nightmare from start to finish. This airline is all about charging you at every step, while offering the worst service imaginable. Let’s start with their baggage policy – it’s designed to trap you. They charge for every single inch or gram, and there’s zero flexibility or understanding. It’s not just strict, it’s a money-making scheme. The online check-in, which is supposed to be free, never works. Every single time I’ve tried it, it fails. And good luck trying to get help – their customer care is completely useless. They either don’t pick up the phone or, if by some miracle they do, they don’t resolve anything. Because of that, you’re forced to do counter check-in at the airport, and guess what? That’ll cost you around 40 QAR. Want to avoid that by buying check-in access through their app? Better do it more than 4 hours before departure, or else you’ll still pay more – 10 QAR if you’re lucky. It’s just another trap to milk money from passengers. The planes are old, the seats are uncomfortable, there’s no proper waiting area, no food, and the staff at the counters are rude and unhelpful. There is zero sense of hospitality or customer care. It honestly felt like they don’t care about passengers at all – only profits. Avoid Salam Air at all costs. You’re better off paying a bit more with a better airline than going through this stress and disappointment.

### "not ready to accommodate"
DXB Terminal-2 staff informed Flight will be delayed, they exact delay and other information was provided by Salam Air staff as they are supposed provide or aware. After counter opened we requested about the status of the flights DXB-MCT-BLR connecting flight, whether it will be adjusted with other Airlines or it will wait for us or what is the status. Salam Air staff told flight will be waiting in MCT Airport and more details will be provided in MCT Airport by concerned Salam Air staff and DXB Salam Air staff issued boarding passes for the both flights. Flight was supposed to depart at DXB Terminal-2 at 20:05 Hrs, but it departed around 00:00 Hrs. Flight landed at Muscat Airport around 01:00 Hrs. 5. We have approached Transfer desk for the Transit Flight. Muscat Airport staff told No Staff is available related Salam Air being a weekend and flight MCT-BLR departed MCT as per schedule. Then we asked what is the status of Transit passengers travel. They responded we will get back to you. Co-passengers tried to call 24X7 Customer care numbers 1210. There is no response. After continuous follow-up and multiple discussions with the Muscat Airport Staff at Transfer Desk  some authorized person came, we are not sure who is he. He conveyed and assured us, we will arrange alternative flights for your respective destinations in India quickly for sure and he left that place. At Transfer counter we have given our multiple options with different flights from MCT to different flights/locations in India. They are not ready to accommodate or not ready to discuss with other Airlines people also. After multiple discussions they told we will try to accommodate in other flights. In between we requested for water and refreshments. As there is no action until around 10:30 Hrs I booked tickets for my Family in another flight which was scheduled at 12:45 Hrs Air India Express (MCT-LKO-BLR) with more cost.

### "Very bad experience"
Very bad experience, both flights from Muscat to Salalah & Salalah to Muscat delayed more than 3:30 hours. Without any consideration or pre announcement, non response of customer care 24/7

### "provides almost nothing as a service"
Not Verified |  The airline is unnecessarily expensive and provides almost nothing as a service. The meal should be bought. The price is high and quality is poor. Airline does not even offer water. Additionally if you need a blanket you should pay a cost of 6 OMR ( ~$14.00). Most of the seats is selected via a payment method. No entertainment is available. No cabin wifi This is disgustingly annoying policy

### "a disappointing experience"
Not Verified |  My review is about the service provided by SalamAir. My flight was delayed by 4 hours, causing me to miss my connecting flight. The company promised to reimburse me and claimed that the refund had been processed, but I have not received any payment. Furthermore, they have stopped responding to my emails. Overall, a disappointing experience.

### “rude and arrogant flying staff”
One of the worst airlines I have ever flown with. Very rude and arrogant flying staff, they don't have even basic English communication to talk to passengers and talking by making hand gestures in a very harsh voice. Was quite surprised to see that, they just push the luggage in the overhead cabins like anything irrespective of knowing what would be inside the luggage. Even the ground staff is not cooperating, they made me reopen the check in luggage 3-4 times just for 2 legs extra for which I finally had to a pay a hefty amount. While airlines like Oman Air, Indigo even and Qatar don't trouble passenger for 1-2 kgs extra..these guys literally made my travel a horrible experience today. I would never ever travel again with them and nor would recommend this to anyone. Just because it's a low cost airline, that doesn't mean they compromise with quality and customer service and satisfaction.

### "expensive and terrible experience"
Not Verified |   My boyfriend and I wanted to celebrate our 10 year anniversary and make the journey of our lives by going to Thailand. We saved money for a long time since we have little to spend. Six (6) days before departure, we received an automatic text from Salam air, notifying us that our flight was cancelled and thanking us for our understanding… i called customer service (which is available 24/7 according to salam air) right away, but the phone is not being picked up… I also emailed multiple times, send direct messages on social media. Since february 1st I have not received any answer from Salam air. They owe me €1000 for the tickets, additional compensation (around €600). Very expensive and terrible experience. We are just students and have little resources and they know it.

### "never fly again with Salam Air"
We were returning back to Europe after holidays in Eastern Asia and desided to buy baggage allowance to bring souvenirs to friends. Have purchased brand new suit case for this, for which we paid around 150 USD. We properly protected and wrapped it in the airport before departure from BKK. On receipt it in Istanbul one of the double wheels was broken and lost. We went to submit our claim. However first clerk was ready to create and to give us claim form, which needed to be sent to Salam Air by e-mail, however after short phone call to Salam Air supervisor he refused to do it saying that it is minor claim and the Salam Air will not compensate this damaged. Hence nothing confirming this damage was given to us. Very disappointed and shall never fly again with Salam Air, especially with checked in luggage.

### "Would not recommend"
Not Verified |  Horrible experience with this airline. They cancelled my first flight, and proceeded to only give me more expensive alternatives. Then they proceeded to cancel the second flight as well. Of course they provided even more expensive options after that which we had to bow out of. Would not recommend.

### "horrible customer service"
Absolutely horrible customer service. I am stuck at Bangkok waiting on customer service to reply several calls, emails and text messages from myself. What's even more painful is they received my call but chose to decline it. Because of them I am now being kept at the detention center still waiting for them to reply because there's no other option. Just horrible. Do not recommend because they'll leave you stranded. Just use your money to pay for an airline that won't intentionally decline your calls.

### "the worst airline ever"
It has been the worst airline ever. I traveled in the Salam Air on July 1st, 2023 and they did not provide me any food which is already paid in the ticket for the food. The cabin crew was really careless in this matter. I ask them 3 times but they not respond.

### "certainly not use this airline again"
It is important to note this airline would never return cash if you cancel the flight, after making a deduction, they would only give you a voucher and only in the name of the original passenger. I will certainly not use this airline again.

### "I don't recommend this airline"
Worst airline ever. I paid for the sandwich, but i didn't receive any. They should include meal in the ticket cost since it was over 4 hours of travel. It reached the destination delayed by 1 hour. Also, my luggage was damaged. I don't recommend this airline.

### "the worst airline ever"
It has been the worst airline ever. My family traveled in the Salam Air on June 29th, 2023 and they did not provide any food for my child and my wife. I have pre-paid already for the food. The cabin crew was really careless in this matter.

### "marred by significant disruptions"
We booked a flight from Phuket to Istanbul with Salam Air, with our final destination being Antalya, Turkey. Unfortunately, our journey was marred by significant disruptions. Firstly, our flight was delayed by four hours, causing inconvenience and disruption to our travel plans. Regrettably, after a two-hour delay, the flight was abruptly canceled, leaving us stranded. We immediately contacted Salam Air's customer support for assistance. However, the representative provided us with false information and failed to offer a suitable solution. She wrongly informed us that the next available flight was fully booked, leading us to cancel our entire reservation. It was later discovered that this information was incorrect, as seats were indeed available on the following week's flight. This miscommunication resulted in unnecessary financial losses and prolonged our ordeal. After the cancellation, we were informed that our original flight had been refunded, leaving us with the only option of booking a new flight at a significantly higher cost. Despite our persistent efforts to communicate with Salam Air's customer care, they displayed a concerning lack of responsiveness. It took an excessively long time, approximately one and a half months, for them to respond to our refund request. Upon review, they claimed that the new ticket did not match their original booking final destination, adding further frustration and a lack of resolution to our already unpleasant experience. We have exhausted all channels of communication with Salam Air, and they have failed to address our concerns or provide an adequate resolution.

### "airport services are terrible"
Not Verified | The worst airline service in the world, they don't let us know when a flight is cancelled, and the airport services are terrible. Don't use this airline any longer.

### "Worst fight ever seen"
Not Verified |  Worst fight ever seen, without any information to the customer the fight was cancelled and we came to the airport without knowing the cancellation. Do the customer service properly, don't make the passengers out to be fools. I will never try to fly with this airline again.

### "Don’t ever fly with this airline"
Disgrace. Don’t ever fly with this airline. They didn’t tell us our flight was cancelled, refused to provide an explanation. We showed up and they were incredibly rude. No refund for the cancelled ticket, no alternative route, no correspondence on their part. Absolute disgrace, avoid this airline at all costs.

### "customer service is poor"
The worst flight I have ever been, the customer service is poor. Cabin crews were rude and they even don't know how to talk to the passengers. The flight is too noisy and not comfortable. They even don't know to speak English.

### "not extending my ticket voucher"
Not Verified | With the onslaught of travel restrictions worldwide, Salam Air, in such a crisis has showcased it's money centric ethics by not extending my ticket voucher. Staff in Dammam who doesn't bother to reply email follow ups was very quick to deny any further support. That will be first and last purchase from this unprofessional airline. Please take a note from my experience and choose other flyers.

### "Good value for money"
Dubai to Kuwait via Muscat. I had 2 flights with Salam Air. First leg from Dubai to Muscat was amazing. It was on an A320N aircraft, new seats, friendly crew and very clean aircraft. Probably one of the best lowcosters, or so I thought. Had a 4 hour connection in Muscat, the new airport is stunning, as good as Hamad Airport in Doha. Time flew by very fast in the free lounges in the airport. But my second flight was a whole lot different. The plane was very old, 22 years (A320-200), seats were worn out, plane smelled and during the flight, the inner cover of the window fell out. I called the purser and the following was our conversation: Me: "Hello, your Window fell out" Purser: "My brother, don't worry. Plane Good Quality. Fly 20 years never crash". Noted. But, the cabin crew was still rather friendly. Overall, for the price I would recommend it. My flight from DXB to KWI via MCT with a bad was 309AED. Good value for money.

### "as expected for a budget airline"
Muscat to Tbilisi. Salam Air is a fairly new budget airline operating out of Muscat, Oman. Check-in in MCT was extremely slow. With only some 10 people in front of me, I needed more than one hour to get my boarding pass. At the gate at the time of boarding, a 30-min delay was announced which – half an hour later – was extended by a further 30 min. This went on in increments until we finally left at 3 am (instead of the scheduled 11 pm). Since there were hardly 30 pax on the A320, everybody had a full row for a short sleep at last. Return was spot on time. Check-in in Tbilissi swift. Plane now packed to the last seat. These are reasonably comfortable but tight, as is to be expected for a budget airline. There is no IFE and no free food. Water was distributed though.
