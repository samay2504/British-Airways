### "take your money for nothing"
Purchased a ticket flight with Sky Airline via kiwi.com from Lima to Cusco which was cancelled few days before the scheduled date of departure. I was given a choice of reimbursement or flight re-schedule and went for the full refund. To my huge surprise I only received a portion of for what I paid. The company is a joke, will take your money for nothing. Avoid by all counts.

### "they charge you for everything"
Terrible in every single sense. No water offered in a 5 hours flight. Arrogant people in the check-in in LIMA, I offered to pay for a small guitar my son was bringing and they prohibited him to get in the plane with that. He ended up losing that! Seats are horrible. No space for your legs, and they charge you for everything.

### "needed to pay an additional fee"
I have flown internationally and through Peru numerous times and never had a problem with my international standard luggage. An agent asked me to place it in the small box and the two straps were above the cutoff with the weight a whopping 12lbs. It was insisted that it was too large and I needed to pay an additional fee. The gentleman told me the airline had made a mistake not charging previously. I will never fly this airline again as I don’t agree with this behavior.

### "their incompetence cost me money"
In February 2024 I was travelling with a group of friends when Sky emailed 2 of us to say we had been rescheduled to a flight the next day for the return flight from Valdivia to Santiago. After reading Sky’s refund policy (100% refund if they delayed or cancelled a flight) and wanting to remain with the group, the 2 of us bought tickets on a LATAM flight set to depart around the same time and then I followed the instructions Sky provided to request a refund. When the group arrived to the airport, the others were informed by airport staff (not by Sky) that the Sky flight had in fact been cancelled entirely. My friends had to be at work the next morning so while looking for another way back, it was noticed that Sky was still selling seats on subsequent flight that day so they managed to have an agent at the Sky service counter switch their tickets for them at no cost. I was furious at having spent $200USD for no reason but the stupidity doesn’t end there. 3 days later, 100% of the taxes (equivalent to about $5) for the cancelled flight were returned to my credit card, so I wrote to ask why. After 2 weeks and my 3rd follow-up, I received an email to say $22 (of the $68USD I paid for that flight) would be turned into a voucher that was valid for 1 year. As a tourist visiting Chile that would be useless for me. I contacted Sky via multiple avenues asking for an explanation. Each time the reply was ‘this case is closed’. I have flown with Sky before and been happy with their service and I understand flights are sometimes delayed or cancelled, but in this case their incompetence cost me money, they did not honour their own policy and their refusal to even answer me are inexcusable so I will not fly with them.

### “odd baggage rules inconsistently applied”
Beware, Sky’s carry-on dimensions are slightly smaller than international standard for a carry-on case. You may be asked to put your standard carry-on case in the measuring box displayed at the check-in counter. And it may be pointed out to you that, while your case slid into the measuring box easily, it is too long (not including wheels) by 1-2 inches. If so, you will be charged full price for checking the item; you won’t receive credit for the carry-on fee you already paid online. You will be told that it is up to you to inquire online about a refund. I question this surprise finding because I bought a “regulation” carry-on case and its size has never been questioned on various trips. I am skeptical of Sky’s allowable dimensions, and also of the inability of the check-in agent to apply credit for what I had already paid toward my new checked luggage fee. Sky ticket prices are good value but, like many budget airlines, you can’t know what you will pay ultimately due to odd baggage rules inconsistently applied. Advise: Don’t use a fixed-dimension carry-on bag when flying with Sky. (In the end, I ditched my std fixed-dimension carry-on case at the counter in favor of a shopping bag, and the check-in agent was satisfied.)

### "purchased tickets with wrong date"
The airline's website is very unstable. In selecting dates, it jumped to different dates, not my selection. I did not notice and purchased tickets with wrong date. Once I found the error, I canceled the tickets and rebooked new sets of tickets. The tickets are Fare Plus, and by airline rules, are 100% refundable. The date I canceled the tickets is still 9 days away from the flight. I also received confirmation email of the cancellation and stating refund in 10 calendar days. By the 11th day, I saw no refund and I called the airline. Surprisingly, she told me only tax is refundable.

### "pay for an additional 7 suitcase allowances"
I purchased airfare for our group of 7, and purchased 7 carry on allowances. When we arrived at the Cusco airport, the attendant forced me to pay for an additional 7 suitcase allowances. I had no choice because we had to travel. The duplicate baggage fees cost much more than the airfare itself.

### “Horrible service, do not fly!”
Not Verified | Horrible service, do not fly! They canceled my flight 8 hours before departure, in other words while everyone was sleeping. Only to awaken 3 hours before departure. The service offered at the counter, after notification of cancellation was to either take a flight the following day or a full refund. Not bad if you're a retired world traveler with an open schedule. This is far from my position, like many travelers we all have pre-arranged schedules that don't coincide with an airline just deciding to cancel a flight for what I'm sure amounts to a "non-sufficient revenue generating flight. I've booked 2 local flights with local carriers while in Peru, both ended in the exact same scenario, a canceled flight at the last minute. The kicker is the customer service, no explanation, no service, no exceptions. Two options, fly the next day or a full refund! Myself, like many others had to find additional flights immediately, paying 3-4 times our original amounts due to last minute bookings. I don't complain much, but this type of service that uplifts everyones schedules is not exceptable in the business arena, fly Latam and most definitely not Skyairlines.com I'd love to hear from upper management with Sky Airlines directly if they're willing to have a public discussion.

### "ability to handle the problem was zero"
On holiday from Italy to Chile, we organized the trip by booking internal flights, tours and hotels months in advance. The only flights booked with Sky Airlines included departure from Santiago on 19 December at 07:50 with arrival in Calama (and then go to San Pedro of Atacama to visit the desert with 2 tours) and return from Calama to Santiago at 07:04 on December 21st. The company canceled the first flight for no stated reason that same night. Cancellation notification at 2.32am on December 19th with flight at 7.50am (on December 19th) and rescheduled the flight the next day. We had our tours booked and paid for, for the evening of the 19th and the whole day of the 20th, and we lost everything. We asked for a refund of the flight and compensation. The company denied the refund of the second flight (the one returning from Calama which we would have taken on the morning of the 21st at 07:00) because only the first flight was canceled (but it is not clear how we could have been in Calama to take the flight return as they had canceled the outbound flight and the rescheduled one was unacceptable and useless). We spent more than 2 hours on the phone with Sky Airlines trying to explain that going to Calama would be useless the next day and that the holiday was ruined, but the company (reachable only on the phone) kept parroting that their policy does not provide a refund for a flight that has not been changed. The service we received on the ground was terrible. None of the company's operators spoke English (we are in an international airport). From the gates they sent us to the ticket counters; at the ticket counters they told us that they can only sell tickets and can't do anything else. No company operator was able to give answers or resolve the problem, neither in person, nor on the phone, nor on the internet. The company's ability to handle the problem was zero. The behavior of the ground handlers and telephone operators was completely unprofessional.

### "bag was allowed in one leg of trip"
When we came from Lima to Cusco we were asked to just put the cabin bag wheels in for bag size check. While going from Cusco to lima they made us put entire bag into the size checker. How can the same bag that was allowed in one leg of trip not be allowed in the other. We were somehow able to fit the bag in their tiny size check but if we weren’t able to, they would have made us pay check bag fees on top of cabin bag fees.

### "I had to book it over the phone"
Not Verified |   Had to rebook a flight from Santiago, Chile to Puerto Natales, Chile due to a missed connection. Tried booking on the website, but kept timing out when I tried to submit payment, so I had to book it over the phone with the SKY reservations number. I was trying to book two Fare Plus tickets which includes one Carry-on bag per ticket. There was an extra charge for the checked bag. When I tried booking on the website, to total cost was $1095.30, but the customer service rep making my reservation for me said the total cost was $1267.64 because I needed to pay for the carry-ons. I kept insisting to him that I did not; we only had one carry-on and with the Fare Plus ticket there was no extra charge for that. But he kept saying "not exactly" and I was stuck because we needed to make this reservation, else our whole trip would have to be cancelled. So I paid it only to find out when we got our boarding passes that we now had "two carry-ons" approved for each traveler (we only had one!) I called Customer Service from the airport and requested this extra charge be reimbursed. The women I spoke with was very helpful and understanding and put a Case Number in for us. That was on 4/6/2023. It's now 4/28/2023 and this issue is still unresolved. Every time I call, I get the runaround, put on hold for 30 minutes plus, and finally told I will hear back in a couple days. Nothing. Today the guy told me I'd hear back in a couple of hours. I do not believe him.

### "check-in my luggage for $40"
Im flying back from Cusco to Lima, carrying the same carry-on luggage I have with an extender open. At the gate at Cusco airport, they wanted me to check-in my luggage for $40. I closed the extender and it did fit their size port but wont go through all the way due to wheels. I still ended up paying because they were insistent. However, on my way to Cusco from Lima 5 days ago, Sky airline allowed my luggage to be carry-on! Well, it’s really a carry-on luggage after all! It’s just annoying that my standard carry-on has to be checked in. When I got on board, there’s a bunch of space in the overhead bins because most people have checked their luggage with all the stuff that they bought.

### "not recommend if you can avoid it"
Sky Airlines will do everything they can to charge you fees. I had 6 flights with them, on 5 of them my bag was able to go but on the 6th they would not let it fly without paying the fees. My bag actually became less full throughout the trip, not larger. It was clearly small enough to fit in the overhead bin and on 5 other flights the boarding crew said it was fine, but some employees are stingy and will make you cough up money. So on the 5th flight they made me pay the fees. My wife's bag is half an inch taller (not deeper at all) and she had to pay for each flight for a bag that clearly fit overhead and was only a few centimeters larger than their allowance. No flexibility on anything, everything relies on fees. I also had other sour experiences with them. I sat in row 5 and tried to use the front restroom, the attendant told me to go to the back and by the time I reached there they opened up the front restroom. Overall would not recommend if you can avoid it.

### "Avoid a headache"
The boarding protocol and check engine took so long that they couldn’t depart at 1 am, then, around 2 am, Lima airport stop Sky Airline flying, because of being so late. In consequence, all the passengers had to wait until 5 am to do can flight to Miami. Many of us lost international connections because of this, with no solution just excuses. Avoid a headache and waste of time and money.

### "Excellent experience throughout"
Excellent experience throughout. We were meant to fly from SCL (Santiago, Chile) to ZCO (Osorno) on 8 Aug. Our first attempt was thwarted as we were unable to land at the destination airport due to heavy fog and had to head back to our origin (the crew would have fallen out of duty, which made a diversion impossible). Communication and management of the situation were flawless. We were kept up to date at all times, and we were given generous meal vouchers. To top things off, we were even provided with a compensatory voucher for our next journey with the airline. The latter came in totally unexpected, as the hiccup was of course not the airline’s fault and beyond their control. After a two-hour wait at SCL and once the fog had cleared, SKY flew us to our destination. A big thank you and well done to the staff at SKY Airline, both visible and behind the scenes, for this seamless, passenger-friendly, and pleasant experience.

### "Good manners would go a long way"
On July 10 2022 I flew Sky Airlines from Lima to Cusco. Passengers are forced to board the plane by walking on the tarmac on cold weather, to be transported by bus to the plane. Seats are uncomfortable, no entertainment onboard, no snacks or drinks. For my trip, double face masks were enforced. I was wearing only one, but one flight attendant demanded me that I wore two masks instead of one. Flight crew came out rude and authoritative. Good manners would go a long way.

### "Stay away from Sky! You have been warned!"
I have to agree with previous reviewers that this is absolutely the worst airline I have ever dealt with. No idea how they are able to stay in business. I purchased the ticket for my friend, from Buenos Aires to Cancun, roundtrip. Her flight was supposed to be yesterday afternoon. They sent her an email in the morning saying that her flight was cancelled until today. You are not able to call to talk to a human, they only use texts. During the texting they informed her that because her flight was cancelled that she would have to contact the third party that I purchased the ticket from, to arrange the second leg of her flight, from Lima to Buenos Aires. She called them (Travelgenio) and they told her they had nothing to do with it. Now she's at the airport in Cancun and they're telling her, in person, that Travelgenio changed her flight, not them. They're refusing to look at the email that Sky sent her. If she gets to Lima they're telling her she'll have to layover for 26 hours! She's going to miss out on work and a family gathering. And no fault of hers or mine whatsoever. It's a complete nightmare and communication break down. Stay away from Sky! You have been warned!

### "The worse airline I ever met"
The worse airline I ever met. I change the date of my flight they charge me 15 dollars and they say everything is fine I do no have another payment and at the airport they can't find my flight reservation I gave them all my information my tickets and they just say they can't find me after send me from a place to another and when I call sky airlines suddenly I have 195 dollars to pay for change the date of my flight. Finally I pay and then they said you are already late for your flight. I ask them if I can go in another flight they say you have to pay 195 dollars. I explained them I just paid 8 minutes ago they say you missed that flight. They make me lose my time at the airport if they just could and tell me you need to paid instead of make wait until last minute so I can pay for nothing and miss my flight and make me pay again.

### "ended up paying for my flight three times over"
I booked a roundtrip flight from Lima to Cusco with Sky Airline on March 14. This flight was booked on Sky's website, NOT through a third party. The return flight was to leave Cusco at 8:10pm. On April 25, Sky Airline sent an email to say that they have moved the flight to 12:50pm. I wasn't going to arrive in Cusco on my way back from Machu Picchu Pueblo until 2:32pm via Inca Rail. Therefore, moving the flight seven hours earlier meant that I would be unable to catch this flight. Their email gave a link to apply for a full refund which would be processed within 30 days of application. I submitted that on April 26 and got a confirmation email of receipt sent to my inbox. However, one month later and multiple attempts to get in touch with the airline via follow-up emails and live chat have been unsuccessful. I ended up having to book a new last-minute flight with LATAM, so I ended up paying for my flight three times over. Disgusting and unprofessional!

### "charged us for our backpacks"
We are foreigners and kind of used to people trying to rob us in Peru just because we are tourists but this was too much and we got really mad. Sky Airline charged us for our backpacks which are 10kg and 15kg. They charged us $36 per backpack even though we said one of them is a carry on and fit the carry on sizes. It says $12 baggage fee online but the truth is $18 when you want to add it on their website. I asked the man if we still can buy online at the counter and he said no. But we would have and should have. I don’t recommend!

### "wanted me to do a PCR test"
This airline uses deceptive practices. I bought a ticket CJC- SCL in Chile and was denied check in because apparently the Ministry of Health has disabled my mobility pass for travel in Chile. First, getting into Chile I had an active Mevacuno access and pass, also PCR negative from entry to arrival in Santiago x2 tests. With my access to Mevacuno, my mobility pass was still current, yet Sky airline wanted me to do a PCR test before they could check in online. This was my last flight before flying international the next day. I tried seeking help to no avail on the app, no customer phone line, and limited staff/counter time especially in Calama, Chile. I couldn't get help from Sky Airlines Chile. In the end I bought LATAM TICKETS and boarded without issues so as to not miss my international flight. MY rapid PCR IN Santiago, Chile is negative. The use of incorrect information, and poor customer service makes this the worst experience in my international travels. Do not travel with this airline especially with COVID-19 protocols and economic challenges.

### "one of the worst experiences I have ever had"
I fly frequently and have never written a review before but was so incredibly frustrated with the experience this morning in Calama, Chile. I was at the airport an hour forty minutes before departure and sitting next to the gate. Right before departure, I heard my name. I went down and they had denied my luggage boarding due to a bottle of insect repellent. In the last month, I had flown with the same luggage from Miami, Santiago, Puerto Montt, Ushuaia, Buenos Aires, Santiago again without issue. They said it was too late to change flights and would put me on the next flight 8 hours later! I said I wanted them to switch me to a different airline but they said they couldn't do it. They even suggested I would need to pay a rebooking fee although they later dropped that. Even if we had hustled, I could have made the flight and we could just thrown away the repellent which cost a few dollars. But instead the person at the counter ignored me, after recognizing my presence and helped other people who weren't even flying. I have flown so many times in my life and it was one of the worst experiences I have ever had. Absolutely incredible the complete disregard and ignorance to customer service in a customer service based industry.

### "difficult to get in touch with"
Booked 4 round trip flights from Lima to Cusco. Had to cancel two of the flights because of a Covid scare. Entered the names and documents ids for the two that were unable to attend and it canceled the return flights for my wife and I as well but none of the documentation showed which flights were cancelled and the reservation still looked the exact same on their website. It wasn’t until attempting to check in that we realized what occurred. Had to rebook at a last minute price and use the entire voucher so now have to repurchase flights for the other two individuals. Customer service was extremely difficult to get in touch with and was no help when we finally did.

### "feel as though they stole from me"
I will not use this airline again if I can help it. I am sorry that I couldn't fly to Peru. And I am sorry that you are not able to provide a service. But if I am not allowed to fly, then I should get my money back. I feel as though that is common decency. Refusing to refund those who can in no way fly because of COVID, I feel is bad business and reflect bad corporations. I am very unhappy and feel as though they stole from me because of conditions out of my hands, but the Peruvian Government hands.

### "their service is very bad"
Santiago to Buenos Aires. I will never fly with this airline again and despite being a little cheaper than the competition, their service is very bad. It all starts with their website, I got an error message when trying to booking a flight there and tried to do it again with another card (getting the same error message). It turned out that they booked the same flight to the same person twice and when I reached out to customer service over the phone they said I had to do it over email. I did it on December 6 and after several attempts and follow ups, I am finally giving up!

### "very bad experience"
Arequipa to Lima. I had a very bad experience with this airline. No good information about the delay and no support or refund because of my missed connection flight and resulting hotel costs etc. Would never fly again with them.

### "Online check-in did not work"
Lima to Mendoza via Santiago. Online check-in did not work. My layover was 4 hours and 10 minutes, so the airline would not check my luggage to my final destination. I had to collect baggage at my layover, clear customs, and recheck it again. Was charged separate checked luggage fee for each connecting flight. Legroom was among the shortest I have ever seen.

### "unpleasant flying experiences"
Sao Paulo to Santiago. One of the most unpleasant flying experiences. It seems like the airline staff has no concept of customer service. Unusually long check-in at the counters. Took every passenger more than 10 mins to check-in. Did not accept the online boarding pass, so had to stand in a queue. On a 4 hour flight, they do not even offer water for free ($3 for a bottle), which is inhumane. No inflight entertainment and very uncomfortable seats that do not recline. When the flight landed and parked, the gates did not open for 30 mins and no explanation was offered. Which was pathetic

### "asked to postpone the flight"
Lima to Arequipa. I had a very bad experience with this airline. I was in Peru and my mother was very ill. She passed away the day I had to fly with Sky from Arequipa to Lima. We had asked to postpone the flight. They never answer. You have to spend hours at the phone to try to get someone to manage your problem. Still today I am waiting for their answer. I am back in Germany, I had to buy a ticket for 300 dollars from Arequipa to Lima (Lan ticket) to get my international flight.

### "hand luggage about 2cm too high"
Calama to Santiago. We had a bad experience with this airline. We had normal size hand luggage but Sky Airlines say they are about 2cm too high. We did not have any other hand luggage just a large bag We gave up for which we paid of course. So now we paid 60€ take hand luggage with us in airplane. Also for me (1,90m, thin) seats are too small so I cannot sit without legs on the side. All in all very bad experience.

### "my reservation was cancelled"
Terrible experience due to inexistent customer service. I had booked online a flight Lima to Santiago then a second flight Santiago to Buenos Aires. On the day of my first flight, as I want to check in on Internet, I realized that my reservation was cancelled, without notice and without explanation. I called the service center through my hotel, they never picked up although I was calling during the announced opened hours. I went to the airport, the Sky airline counters repeated me they were unable to help me. I had to call the service center to deal with an internet purchase. It's a Peruvian number and I don't have a working cell in Peru. They told me my only option was to use public phones, which I did on my money, still without luck. The supposedly available customer service line never picked up. Because no one on ground could apparently help me, I eventually lost that flight. And obviously lost the second flight in this way, along with a couple of 100$. Needless to say, I couldn't cancel it properly because, guess what. The customer service, well, never picked up my call. I honestly never had such bad experience with any airline customer service. I am pending on potential partial refund of the second ticket.

### "paying the US$70 to board"
Santiago to La Serena. When boarding the preferential boarding line for the bank of Chile (whose preferential customers are allowed to carry luggage at no cost), they asked us for the identity card and credit card of the bank of Chile and let us pass, along with Our hand luggage without any problem. That to 6 of us, while 2 of our friends are told that they have to pay for the luggage for not being customers of the Bank of Chile. The rest of our friends board the plane, while I returned with my wife to the boarding counter to try to help our friends thinking that with our benefit from the Bank of Chile, with the Master Card and Visa Infinite Black cards of both, we could also include our other 2 friends who travel under the same reservation of ours. We failed to convince the person at the counter, who finally charged our friends US$35 for each hand luggage. In the meantime they told us to board while they were paying, but we stayed to wait for them. But the worst comes later. The person at the counter, angry because we claim to try to help our friends and recorded the situation, told us that now we also have to pay US$35 for hand luggage, US$70 in total. At that time we showed her again our ID and black cards from the bank of Chile and we explained that we had already passed a while ago, but there was no case. She told us that we should have gone to the check in counter to qualify for the benefit. I have flown about 20 times with Sky Airlines in recent years using the benefit of the Bank of Chile and had never had a problem with my hand luggage using the benefit, having almost never gone through the check in counter. Moreover, one of the main reasons to choose Sky vs Other airlines is for this benefit. Additionally, I mentioned that we tried unsuccessfully to go through the preferred counter to try to change my seat for emergency exit and pass the baggage but there was a huge line of about 30 people and a single counter attending, which made it absolutely unfeasible and we would miss the flight waiting more than an hour at the preferred customers line. After a long discussion with the person at the boarding counter and about closing the door of the plane, they called the supervisor to try to fix the situation. But the supervisor was inflexible, she understood nothing about the situation and told us that if we didn't pay the US$70, the plane would let us down. Even after a couple of payment attempts, the payment machine did not work for them. Even so, she did not want to make the exception, while the gate was already closed. Finally, and with tremendous discomfort, we ended up paying the US$70 to board, while large numbers of passengers, without even being clients of the bank, passed their luggage without paying and without anyone telling them anything. After this I asked the supervisor for her name in order to write a claim. But she didn't want to give me her name, saying that if I insist, she would let me down the flight. One thing is to have no-criteria to handle the situation. But another much more serious is not to be responsible for that non-criteria, without being willing to give the name and abusing the power at that time when the plane was going to let us down.

### "canceled  flight without any notice"
Cusco to Lima. They canceled the flight without any notice. We found out when we arrived to the airport by 2 uninformed employees who couldn't tell us when and if we would have had an alternative flight. We had to go to Lima because the day after we would have come back to Europe, thus we bought 2 more tickets by own with LATAM at the cost of 450 us$, in addition to the 180us$ already spent with Sky airline. The company'employees told us we could only ask for a refund in Lima. When we arrived in Lima, the clerk dumped us and left us the call center number. A Peruvian number, that if you don't have a local mobile is difficult to contact. The centralist told me that I had the right to a refund and that it would be arrived within 15 days. I really want to see what'll happen. For now we just felt cheated.

### Sky Airline customer review
Buenos Aires to Santiago. Staff have no intention to speak in English - not all of us speaks Spanish. My friend's got damaged on first flight. Couldn't get help or no one to complain. Just gave email address and walked off. Not even sorry. Second flight was even worse. Lagguage got lost and the same. Asked for hotel and another people translated that bag will came with next flight and be delivered to your hotel. Next day took a couple hours until those staff found bag.

### "Leg space was adequate"
Santiago de Chile to Buenos Aires. Sky Airline is a low cost airline based in Santiago, Chile. I took a short flight of 2 hours from Santiago to Buenos Aires. The flight departed on time. As a low cost airline, seating is in one class. Leg space was adequate. The crew came around to sell drinks and snacks shortly after takeoff. My overall impression of the airline is that it will get you safely to your destination with no frills.

### Sky Airline customer review
Lima to Santiago. One of the worst airlines I have flown. We were put on and off the plane twice for two separate mechanical issues. Then they lost our luggage and the gate agents were clueless on what to tell people. I eventually had to buy a new ticket on a different airline.

### "exactly as you'd expect"
I flew with Sky Airline from Santiago to Calama (the closest airport to the Atacama desert) and when getting my baggage it was broken - the strap of my backpack was damaged. I told airline-personnel at the airport but they refused to help and just pointed at the customer service which was supposed to contact me within 10 days. Of course I never heard of them so I wrote an email myself. It took quite a while for them to respond but with the same result as directly at the airport - they acknowledged the problem but refused to stand for it. So in case you fly with them, hope that everything will be fine afterwards, you probably won't get compensated otherwise. The flight was exactly as you'd expect it from a low-cost airline - they got me from A to B.

### "Customer service is non-existent"
Flew Sky Airline from Punta Arenas to Santiago. Horrible airline, pay the extra for LATAM. Customer service is non-existent. The booking process is completely broken and doesn’t work reliably on iOS devices. Flights don’t run on time. Passengers booked on the same PNR aren’t seated together unless you pay more. They managed to leave our luggage behind, and had no staff or baggage services to help.

### "good low cost alternative"
Good low cost alternative to LATAM. With a group I flew from Santiago to Punta Arenas. The flights were on time and the service was very good. The only comments are that the seat pitch isn't brilliant (we flew once on newer aircraft) the pitch seemed limited. And the check in at SCL was a bit of a nightmare. If checking in bags turn up 2 hours pre departure as there were queues. Would fly with Sky again as their prices are favourable compared to the national carrier. If you're from Europe this airline is comparable to Easyjet.

### "seat pitch better than expected "
Buenos Aires to Lima via Santiago de Chile. Their web page is not fully functional in English and booking does not go smooth all the time as some reviewers already wrote. I was booking two separate tickets for two different flights and one payment was not accepted but I got confirmation number. To avoid being charged multiple times I used both contact form and provided email contact to ask about payment but never got an answer. After checking with card provider that card was not charged I bought ticket for the other flight few days later. Payment was accepted and confirmation mail sent with the new booking number. Online check in is available 2 days and 3h in advance and boarding passes need to be printed and presented during baggage drop off. Luggage drop off was done at normal check in counter, 23kg hold luggage is included in ticket price. Planes are boarded from the last row and it was well organised. Both flights were full. Planes are in fine condition and clean, there are ads in the cabin but not too many. Seat pitch was better than expected and I had enough space even on longer flight to Lima which is 3h30m long. Buy on board have few options and is affordably priced. Pesos and U$ are only accepted. FAs were well groomed and professional. There was no selling of lottery and similar things, flight deck gave info about the flights and bridges were used all the time for boarding and disembarking. Both flights left and arrived on time. Few days after the first flight feedback survey was sent and it was in Spanish, no option to choose Englis. Messy web page, problematic booking and lack of communication after pushed down the airport and flight experience which could be described as good as any European short haul experience, legacy or LCC.

### "smiles all the time"
Santiago to Punta Arenas via Puerto Montt. We flew on Sky Airline for our hiking trip in Patagonia during October 2016. We booked the flight about 3 months ago through their website but was unable to complete the transaction. I have to call my credit card concierge service to make the booking for me which was uneventful. At the airport, we had 2 backpacks for check-in and the upon arrival of Santiago Airport at 10 AM, the check-in counter was open with multiple agents available. At the check-in counter the staff did not speak too much English but was efficient and uneventful to check in our luggage to final destination. The boarding was quick and efficient and we had a on time departure from Santiago to our first stop, Puerto Montt. Since I knew I booked with a semi-low cost carrier, I did not expect any inflight entertainment or food/drink service for our short flight, but to my delight, they do serve snacks and drinks for all passengers for free. The captain made the announcements in Spanish, English and French. All flight attendants do speak basic English (which wasn’t the case for my LATAM flight from Santiago to Easter Island). After arrival at Puerto Montt, the flight received additional passengers for the next leg to Punta Arenas. Similar to the first leg, the departure, flight was uneventful. Flight attendants had smiles all the time which made the flight more enjoyable.

### "no one answered phone calls"
Buenos Aires air traffic control went on strike so we had to rebook our connecting flight with Sky Airline to from Buenos Aires to Santiago. Doing so proved impossible. No one answered our phone calls or responded to emails. We finally arrived at Buenos Aires with a connecting flight to Santiago on Air Canada. While at the airport we stopped at the Sky desk to speak to a person about our experience. We were only second in line but the customer service person attending to the individual in front of us took so long, and then took so long responding to our questions that we almost missed our connecting flight. I have never witnessed such a non responsive airline before.

### "Sky Airline was on strike"
We planned a trip to include 4 days in Buenos Aires, arrived from Patagonia at 5am for our flight on Sky Airlines that was supposed to leave at 7am to make the most of every minute only to find out Sky Airline was on strike. Lost over 6 hours trying to get someone to handle our situation watching everyone be "placed" on different flights, run from one end of the airport to the other and have to come back because the airlines had not "been paid by Sky Airlines". We were finally sent to Buenos Aires losing half of our first day there, coming back on Aerolineas Argentinas who charged me for the second piece of luggage "because Santiago is not considered international". Had to come back on a flight 3 hours earlier than we wanted. Tried to claim the money I should have never been charged, was given an email address and it’s been over 2 weeks and have not heard back from anyone.

### "flight attendants very helpful"
Santiago to Arica return for holidays. It was a nice experience to fly the newly turned low-cost Sky Airline from Chile as the competition for this route had the double price. Only 1 checked baggage allowed (as compared to 2 for.most South American airlines) was enough. The prices on board for beverages and snacks were not that high as compared to the European low cost airlines and with the exception that when we landed to Arica we had to wait more than one and a half hours in the plane because somebody forgot his/her luggage inside the terminal and the police had to check it for a bomb (this was what we were told afterwards in the airport), both flights were on time or before schedule, flight attendants were very helpful and friendly. There was a lack of entertainment on board.

### "changed the time of our flight"
Sky Airline changed the time of our flight from Santiago to São Paulo flight without any warning. I now have to wait 12 hours in the airport. I have attempted several time to talk with someone but they have no supervisor available during the night and the only information given was "send a email to help / support". I have sent the email but the reply apparently takes a few days. Nobody speaks English, after 8 hours sleeping on the floor I managed to talk with a supervisor who told me that she could not give me a breakfast voucher. I am very disappointed with this company.

### "do not reply to e-mails"
I never actually flew - as the airline changed the time of the connection flight to 3 hours before first flight arrived. They then offered me a flight with a wait of 10 hours leaving close to midnight and only arriving in Lima at 8 am. Which meant I miss my next connection. I cancelled this in July. Received reply that agent must lodge - agent lodged it in JULY. It is now November , my holiday over - I booked through LAN and left at the time that Sky originally had my booking for, but now Sky do not reply to e-mails. They let the phone ring and then play music for over and hour without answering. They have no access on the website. I'm so frustrated and disappointed - as it was 2 tickets (one for my husband and one for me) - value over $2000 NZ dollars.

### "a great experience"
Nice travel. We had a great experience with Sky Airline from Buenos Aires to Santiago. The only thing I can say is that they could offer a snack with the drinks. The seats were comfortable. In general it was good!

### "crew was attentive "
I flew from Santiago de Chile to Punta Arenas. Sky Airline offers only Economy Class seating. The fight from Santiago to Punta Arenas makes a regular but short stop in Puerto Montt. For a low-cost airline compared to South American standards, Sky Airline was quite good. The crew was attentive throughout the flight. The pilot even mentioned when we flew over the famous Torres del Pain national park in Patagonia. We were served drinks on both legs of the flight. Seat comfort is okay for short to medium distances. Also, they don't have any IFE or wifi connection available on their Airbus fleet. However, I would definitely fly again with Sky Airline since it's great value for money.

### Sky Airline customer review
Normally it is really hard for people over 6'8 ft tall to fit into economy seats. Therefore, we ask the airlines for emergency seats. However, Sky Airline is one of those airlines that gives these type of seats to anyone, but not to those who actually need them. This is how my short, really uncomfortable trip started. No entertainment aboard provided at all, even the airline doesn't allow the passenger to use any electronic device in the entire flight. My food was a small sandwich and a soda, normal plane food. Once we arrived at the airport, we had to wait over an hour to receive our bags. According to the airline, "They didn't have much workers to give us our bags earlier". The worst part of it, is that they have this huge logo in every plane saying that they were granted the Skytrax Award as a best airline.

### Sky Airline customer review
SCL-PUQ-SCL via PMC both ways. Airbus 319s in decent condition. The plane on the outbound journey was second-hand from EasyJet - there was orange on the overhead bins the EasyJet upholstery design on the (very cramped) seats and even a random "Thank you for flying EasyJet" pre-recorded announcement that came on. Each segment came with complementary meal service so we had four meals on the round-trip which weren't amazing but were mostly edible. Beverage service includes wine and pre-mixed pisco sour but no beer. Staff was courteous but not noticeably welcoming. Don't let the pretty awful website give you the wrong impression Sky seems to be a fine airline that got us and our luggage where we needed to be in the promised time at less than half the cost of LAN.

### Sky Airline customer review
We flew from P.Arenas to Santiago last Sunday (21/12/2014 leaving at 6am) online check-in was easy (we had to print the boarding pass) baggage drop off as well. The crew were nice and they served us breakfast (cake hot drink yoghurt and cereals) at 7am and then again at 9.30am with a hot croissant hot drink yoghurt and juice. We took off with a delay but arrived on time. Would fly again!

### Sky Airline customer review
I used this airline for a trip from Concepcion to Punta Arenas via Perto Montt then returned to Santiago via Perto Montt. In my years of travel I have not had such a smooth comfortable and overall pleasing trip. The A319-100 was clean the cabin service was polite and helpful and the food was good. Of course any airline that serves Chilean wine is doing a good thing. My trip to Santiago could have been stressful in that those who purchased the tickets for my party of eight had erred in making our final destination back to Concepcion. Sky changed our itinerary with no challenge and even made luggage allowances to our favor. I would recommend this airline and will use it when I return to Chile in the fall.

### Sky Airline customer review
CCP-SCL-CJC and return with a stopover in CPO on the return flight. All segments operated by A319-100 aircraft. Top-notch service on every single sector with complimentary food and drinks. Whereas the main competitor LAN is apparently cutting costs at all edges yet serving only a piece of cake in a plastic wrap or a minuscule bag of peanuts and raisins on national routes Sky still manages to spoil its passengers with a more than adequate snack that usually includes a sandwich a delightfully filled puff roll or pasta with fresh ham a fruit salad a piece of cake bread and some chocolate. We were welcomed aboard their aircraft with a candy which was nice. Departure and arrival always on time or ahead of schedule with no problems regarding baggage which was always delivered promptly. The flight attendants could have been more smiley except for one who stood out providing a very warm service. However they were no grumpier than on other airlines. Aircrafts had been acquired from EasyJet and their onboard equipment is thus basic but they are all in an excellent condition. Considering the airfares and the product delivered Sky Airline has become a competition that LAN Airlines needs to take more than seriously.

Lome-Abidjan Business Class. I flew this short 60 min flight from Lome (Togo) to Abidjan (Ivory Coast). The transit time at this small airport was approximately 1 hour. Boarding went smoothly. The bus dropped us of at the stairs (approximately 100m from the gate). My seat was 1D on a Boeing 737 New Generation. All business class seats were configured 2x2 and were all leather. Announcements were made and manual safety instructions shown. Take off was smooth. At cruising level the cabin service started and a warm meal was offered. Soon after tables where cleared and cabin prepared for landing. All in all a very pleasant experience.

Departure on time from Santiago to Punta Arenas. 2 stop-overs are too many for such a flight in Puerto Montt and in Balmaceda. Onboard service is fine. We asked for a blanket without any problem. Food service ok. Snacks and beverage between each stop-over. Cheep flights. Flight schedule respected. I recommend it if you allow yourself an entire day to fly from Santiago to Punta Arenas!

### Sky Airline customer review
Santiago to Puerto Montt return. Flights on time service efficient and polite although not over the top. Aged B737-200 well over 20 years old but that is one of the reason I selected Sky. For the cost can't really go wrong and would recommend for anyone who either is price conscious or loves flying different aircraft.

### Sky Airline customer review
Santiago to Punta Arenas via Perto Montt. Sky Airline has 8 ageing Boeing 737-200s flying mainly internal routes including this relatively long haul to the tip of Chile. Check-in was smooth and efficient and the booked seats (on the left of the plane to see the Andes chain) were delivered. But after that things unravelled. The incoming plane from Concepcion was 1.5 hours late; the weather at Concepcion was blamed. But LanChile had no problems! No announcements were made; all enquiries had to be requested individually from the occasional ground staff at the gate. Take-off was 2 hours late. No apologies; just a take it or leave it approach. The all-Economy cabin is very cramped. Meal service was poor. Only an inedible pasta; the chicken option had all gone by the time the troley had reached me in Row 7. One of the flight attendants was surly and rude but her colleague tried to cover over her dreadful attitude. The only reason to use Sky Airline is that it is cheap; of your budget can run to it use LanChile; far more professional.

### Sky Airline customer review
We flew from Santiago de Chile to Calama and return and had a good flight. Crew attentive and service good. One of us wanted an extra glass of wine and no problem there either. On arrival a piece of luggage was missing but has been returned the very same day by Sky to our hotel 100km further in San Pedro de Atacama.

### Sky Airline customer review
Internal flights in Chile to and from Concepcion. All flights on time. In service quality good. No problem when extra drinks asked for. This is our second time with them and would definitely fly again.
