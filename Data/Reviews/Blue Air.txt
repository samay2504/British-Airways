### “airline has zero customer service skills”
Airline cancelled my flight from Tel Aviv with zero notice despite having a mobile telephone number and my email address. I turned up at the airport to discover the flight had been cancelled. Desperately trying to get out of Tel Aviv I discovered this company doesn’t even have a telephone number to contact someone! They also do not respond to emails that you can only send via their website (yes, no email address either). I have now sent three emails via their website asking for a full refund to which I have received absolutely no response whatsoever. This airline has zero customer service skills, effectively left me to organise alternative flights home. It’s now been 3 weeks and yet still nothing from them.

### "not honoured the refund"
Terrible airline, they cancelled my flight 2 or so weeks before it was even supposed to take off due to not enough people booking tickets. They did offer me a different flight however this was days before I was even in the departing country. They then agreed to a refund at which point they have kept dragging out with whatever excuse suits them on the given day as to why it can't be refunded yet and then stopped replying altogether and have not honoured the refund. Paid for a flight that never existed in the first place.

### "We had a terrible experience"
We had a terrible experience with this company. Traveling with 2 small kids we were assigned different seats, and also had to pay 40 euros check in tax, beacuse it was impossible to make the check in online. I understand that check in should happen at the airport when traveling with small kids, but why the extra tax? The staff at the check in counter and also inside the plane are very unprofessional. I would not recommend traveling with this air company unless no other alternative.

### "Avoid it by all means"
Completely unprofessional. They refuse to give the money back and offer no choice but accepting their lousy vouchers only to keep cancelling the flights. Briefly, they receive money from the customers and "transform" it into virtual money that you never get the chance to use because they keep cancelling. Avoid it by all means.

### "one week later cancel flights"
You will reach your destination faster by walking. They charge for tickets, one week later cancel flights, then you wait months to get your money back, if you will ever receive your money back.

### "They practically sold more tickets than seats"
I flew two weeks ago from Stuttgart airport to Bucharest Otopeni. All good, I made my check in there and my luggage was good I didn't pay anything extra. Then I flew back from Bucharest and was charged with 30€ for my check in and 35€ for the same luggage. The staff being misinformed they could not explain to me the reason. But the best part is just coming, 120 seats and 120 passengers so the plane was full, but there was more 6 people who had tickets for the same flight but no seats. Two of those six people stayed on in Bucharest. They practically sold more tickets (126) than seats (120). Good Luck with that guys I Look that everybody knows that they should not fly anymore with this company.

### "Avoid like the plague"
First off it's not that cheap really, our flight departure and return destination was changed to a different, inconvenient airport at a different inconvenient time. EU regulations imply that a refund or a free change should be offered, but that won't appear anywhere in the email they send you (which essentially reads "it is what it is, suck it up"). Thirdly, and the true cherry on top, some of the reserved seats we bought in order to travel together had to be bought again, as the child in our party was moved far from her parents for no good reason at all once the departure airport was changed. There is no customer support. Two requests to at least reimburse the same seats we had to needlessly buy for a second time and not cheaply, were systematically ignored. Ludicrous, they shouldn't be allowed to operate. Basically TAROM flies to all BlueAir destinations and these days their fares are comparable - and when you add up all the inconveniences, not only will you be happier with TAROM but also quite likely with more cash in your wallet. Avoid like the plague.

### "charged 350 lei for check-in"
Not Verified |  Although I paid for check-in online, the data was not transmitted to the flight operator until this time. We were also charged 350 lei for check-in by Blue Air. Also, their operator at Cluj Napoca Airport said about the eSky company that you are that collects money from customers for services you do not do. Unprofessional conduct. Charges extra money for tickets bought from other operator. I used eSky many times before with no problem till blueair.

### "My flight with Blue Air got cancelled twice in 2 weeks"
My flight with Blue Air got cancelled twice in 2 weeks. I got a cancellation notification, I had to change my travel plans, lost a lot of money on accommodation, to find out 1 weeks later that my modified flight is cancelled again. They sell tickets, cancelled the flights and operate with our money as it's also impossible to get a refund or reach out to customer support. Extremely unreliable, I can't believe something like this even exists. This really has to stop.

### "Website a waste of time"
Not Verified | Dublin to Bucharest. Website a waste of time - full of lies; type words like name, address and other information with problems, double up the letters; constantly showing is loading - I've tried from different devices, different hours, the same problem -  similar with the app! The call centre just doesn't exist! (another website lie) - 5 stars for advertising fake promos! A shame!

### "give us seats far away from each other"
Not Verified |  It's the 3rd or 4th time they give us seats far away from each other with no option to select/check in before flight. The flight attendant told me it's because it has to be paid before boarding. First of all, no other company does this. If money is a problem for this poor company then simply raise the ticket price and don't separate families. It is the last time I fly with this joke of a company.

### "I am still waiting for a refund"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline on this planet. Booked a flight for 5/05/2020 which was cancelled due to Covid - money was refunded to an online wallet that I am not interested in as the airline doesn't even operate this route anymore. I am still waiting for a refund to the original method of payment. Called customer service numerous times in the past 2 years and all the time I got "we will process your refund" - this never happened. I have also filled out the online form numerous times and got nothing as well. It's been 2 years almost since the flight. The company has changed their customer service numbers and they now have only chargeable numbers available. I have still tried to call these numbers - both the UK and the Romanian number - call gets cut off before anyone picks up.

### "check in in the airport cost extra money"
I understand most of the people do the check in online in order not to stay in lines in the airport, however now there is another reason. The check in in the airport cost extra money. In my case it cost the same amount as the flight ticket. It's not the fact that I paid the money which annoys me the most, it's the fact I was not informed, let me decide if I want to pay that or not. When I asked at their office why there is no notice, they replied that we should be the ones who research online about this, I feel like I was scammed.

### "Never again with that airline"
Not Verified | Flight got cancelled in August 2021 (due to "operational reasons"). I immediately requested a refund. Now it is January 2022 and nothing has happened. Sent several requests via e-form, always received standardized nonsense feedback ("too many claims", "unprecendented situation"). For the last inquiries I didn't even get an answer anymore. Called the service hotline several times. Nobody can help ("We dont know, nobody knows"). There is no possibility to speak to the right department, to a supervisor, to escalate, to get an estimated time of refund. Last call dd 03 January: the robot voice repeatedly confirmed the average waiting time was 3mins ... finally got through to an operator after 31mins, who hung up on me after 2mins.e. Never again with that airline.

### "strongly recommend this airline"
Not Verified | I had an issue when I booked my tickets, payment error and I managed to double book. After calling the support on phone, they were very helpful and solved my issue right away. They refunded my second booking (from the double booking) without my request and the amount was on my account in 2 or 3 days. They were fast and kind and helpful. The agent which sadly I forgot the name as I was in a hurry was amazing. The flights were on time, (I had a transfer), clean aircraft and the flight attendants were attentive and helpful. I can strongly recommend this airline even though it's a low cost one.

### "they didn't seem interested to help at all"
Not Verified |  I was due to travel with Blue Air to France on the 23rd December but because I got Covid, I was not able to travel anymore. I called the call centre many times to ask for a refund or credit but the only thing they would offer is for me to change my ticket to another date. When I checked which dates I could change my ticket to, the only month, out of the entire year in 2022 I could possibly change my ticket to was in March. I told them that by that time, I will be around 32 weeks pregnant and so might be difficult for me to fly, the only response I got was "I can't help you, nobody can help you". No choice but to change my ticket to March and now, if I want to change my tickets again (if by some miracle more dates pop up), I will be charged to change our flights. For something that is completely out of my control, I am getting penalised for it and I can't even get a refund. Customer service? Ha! I don't think those words are in their vocabulary, they didn't seem interested to help at all and repeatedly told me that they are just the call centre and can't help.

### "Worst company when it comes to refunds"
Not Verified | Worst company ever when it comes to refunds. I am waiting for my money back since end of September and all I get from their call center is „we don’t know we have a lot of refunds“. What do I care about how many refunds you have? When you are canceling peoples flights you don’t care.

### "Customer Service is so bad"
Avoid this company! Some days before the flight I received an email that the departure hour was changed and that I got the option to cancel the tickets and to receive a full refund. I cancelled the ticket, but nobody sent me a confirmation about this. When I called to Blue air to see what's happening, my ticket was still active. If you are sending them emails nobody will answer. I have already sent three, but no reply. Customer Service is so bad, that you'll just waste your time dealing with them. I'm very disappointed about the entire process.

### "it is a joke of company"
Worst airline in Europe. Please do not buy a ticket with them, it is a joke of company. First they changed the flight date a week before, without giving the option to refund the money. Finally the flight was delayed by more than 2 hours.

### "the worst low cost company"
I made a reservation with 3 seat purchase for me, my wife and my 4yo boy on a two way flight to Larnaca. A month before flight they informed me they changed the time of departure. With worse times of departure. I said fine.. it happens. Bad luck. A week before departure I receive another email that they changed again the flights with a day before. With arrival near midnight on both flights. I had to get another another stay for a night even if I get there after midnight. Why can I do? Sleep with my 4yo in the airport? Two days before flight I try to fill the online check in because the airport chec kin costs extra. I receive a notification that I must fill within 24 hours and I see that the seat for my child was moved to the back of the plane. I said that I cannot let my 4yo to stay separate from us so I paid to change the seat even thought I already paid for the right seats when I made the reservation. One day before flight: I try to fill the online checkin. The website informs me that I need to pay again the seats full price. So I cannot fill the online checkin and I have to pay for it at the airport. In conclusion: this is one of the worst low cost company with a site that wants to fool you to pay things at least twice. Don't ever fly with BlueAir. I know that I won't.

### "8 months waiting for the refund"
Flight was cancelled in January 2021 due to COVID-19 restriction. There are 8 months waiting for the refund. Despite numerous complains Blueair does not want to pay back the money. =I will definitely never ever book again, and I would not recommend anybody to book this airline.

### "Hands down the worst airline"
Not Verified |  Hands down the worst airline I’ve ever flown with. I booked my ticket two months prior to the flight and paid extra for a specific seat. On the day of the flight, upon checking in my luggage, I was told I have no seat on the plane because “I hadn’t utilised the online system recently” - although it is perfectly within my right to check in at the CHECK IN desk if I have CHECK IN luggage. The general attitude of the staff was one of indifferent and “oh well, tough luck”. I was told to stand at the boarding gate, wait for everyone to board and then maybe there’s a seat left. Long story short, there was a seat left at the very end, I was ushered onto the plane whilst the pilot or someone was shouting and cursing the stressed out boarding employee through the walkie talkie. Not to mention I did not get to sit on the seat I paid for, but I lived through two hours of extreme stress and anxiety in which I didn’t know if I would make it back to work the next day or have to fork out hundreds for a new flight. II pray this airline goes bust, although I’m afraid it won’t

### "did not let me on the plane"
Avoid at all cost! The lady at the gate did not let me on the plane because they thought the rules for entry in UK were different to the actual rules. They did not let me talk to a manager. She just ignored me, told me to call the embassy, leave the airport to talk to an agent, ignored me again, and then just left at the end. I was not the only person in this situation. Firstly, if you have a boarding pass you should be let in! You can always get fined by the country on arrival, which would not have been the case. Secondly, this was just ridiculous. I will now miss 2 days of work, and had to pay £600 for the next available flight. I knew they were bad, but not like this. Also, during this whole time the pilot was shouting at her to stop letting people in as it was late and he wanted to leave, only because she wasn't able to process everyone quickly enough. How could you do that?

### "Worst company ever"
I would give 0 stars if possible. Worst company ever. They have all kind of additional services to add to your flight ticket, like priority boarding which I paid, but at the airport in Bucharest the lady at check in told me that they don't do such things and they don't have priority boarding. Moreover, I have paid extra money to have a meal on board and I was never given one. Now I am trying to contact them and I am waiting around 1 hour at phone only for the call to be disconnected after due to some technical issues on their end, as the robot said. They don't answer on emails either. I don't know why nobody checks them.

### "worst experience with an airline"
The worst experience with an airline. I booked my ticket online. Even though I paid the fee for my luggage, I was told that I have to pay an extra 150 euros because my reservation did not match the reservation on their software. I have shown them the confirmation on my e-mail where it was confirmed that I have already paid for my luggage, but the confirmation was not taken into account. Moreover, the personnel was very impolite. Never flying with this company again.

### "was the worst experience"
Not Verified |  This was the worst experience of my life. In Helsinki I had problems getting a seat because I had checked in online. The next day when I was flying from Bucharest to I had problems checking in again online. And when I had to check in at the airport I had to pay 35 € extra and when I complained about that considering I couldn't check in online they decided I had a bad attitude and refused to give me a boarding ticket. After I had payed 35€. Then after they felt they had humiliated me enough I got the boarding ticket. The staff was rude. Do not fly with this airline company. It's not worth it.

### "Avoid if you have alternatives"
Just spent 2 hours today trying to check in and didn't resolve anything. I have logged in, started checking in, and could not go any further from the luggage selection - because I have purchased my luggage + priority and all mod cons, it showed all my luggage, there was no selection available for me but when trying to move ahead the page would just simply reload (no error message). I have tried to call the call centre, spend 49 minutes in queue only to hear a message "I'm sorry, we're experiencing technical difficulties" and they hung up! All this for 470.95 euro (two tickets, one way)! This is a terrible company, I only use it because there are not that many options from my city - this is something they know and take advantage off. Avoid if you have alternatives.

### "a payment if we wanted to board the plane"
I express my deepest rejection of the situation that presented itself to me at the counter of your airline in the city of Barcelona on Friday July 9, for our flight to Larnaca, with a connecting flight in Bucharest. When we presented ourselves to the counter, we explained that we could not check in online because the page gave us an error, The representative asked us to try again in front of her to check such error, realizing that in effect the page did not work, she informed us that we had to make a payment to check-in. By insisting that it was not our fault, in a very impolite way he urged us to make such a payment if we wanted to board the plane, which we rejected since it was not our fault that the website was down, in short, when we were short of time since we spent several minutes discussing why they would charged us for something that was already paid for and that it was not our fault we were not be able to do the check in, we made the decision to pay again so we would not to miss our flight and, conveniently your airline does not receive payments with card; Only cash, which we found very rare, since even the plane itself receives payments with cards for beverage, but not the airline counter? Another representative received the money but said that she had no change. We are extremely offended by the way your officials treat their clients.

### "Extremely satisfied for the price"
Extremely satisfied for the price. Considering I managed to pay under 20€for the roughly 2h flight I couldn't be happier with the airline. The flight was over punctual, boarding was easy and uncomplicated and the cabin crew has been really nice and professional. The aircraft was new and had the industry standard slim seats which led to a reasonable amount of legroom. They even had a recline functionality which is quite unusual for low cost carriers. Even the Infight services have been perfect. A big 0.5l Water for only 2€ and food for similar competitive prices. All in all very satisfied and definitely a better experience than on Ryanair flights for a similar price.

### "pay for my checkin"
I booked a flight from Lisbon to Cluj (via Bucharest, both flights with Blue Air). In Lisbon I was only issued the boarding pass for Lisbon-Bucharest. Upon arrival in Bucharest (with a 1h layover) I was told I had not checked in and need to go to the agency and pay for my checkin. Mine was not the only such issue. I finally paid 40 eur for the checkin and nearly missed my flight.

### "they disappointed me too much"
Not Verified |  This company is incredibly disrespectful. They used to be good but last years they have degraded significantly. A few weeks after booking first issue came up: the last leg (Bucharest - Iasi) of the flight was cancelled. No refunds, no nothing. So on top of the ticket price i now had to pay for an extra bus ride to Iasi ! Online check in was not possible, presumably due to the Covid-19 pandemic. But they do charge you 36! Euros for airport check-in fee! When calling them to ask about these problems they just hang up the phone, when contacting them on social media they block you and if you mail them they ignore you. This company needs to be looked at by authorities because this is not serious at all. I used to fly them a lot but last few years they disappointed me too much.

### "does not respect what they themselves printed on the boarding pass"
Took flight 0B1216 and at the gate, we were forced to pay an additional 35EUR for each luggage because the lady at the counter decided it was oversized. They did not measure it with those iron templates that most reputable airlines use. On the boarding pass, it is clearly printed "one piece of luggage of maximum 10kg and 40x30x20cm free of charge" but they simply ignored this and decided the size and weight just by looking at it. Oh, and on the payslip they put "last-minute ticket" not a single reference to oversized luggage which again is a sketchy practice. A company that does not respect what they themselves printed on the boarding pass and charge you at the gate is not a reputable one, in fact, is the worst experience ever. We paid for 3 cabin luggage, additional 105 EUR. Practically this airline just made the money for another seat by this unclear practice.

### "bad customer service"
Such a bad customer service. Flight got cancelled and there is no way to contact them. The invoice reply is an automatic email and they don't answer the phone after calling two times and waiting over 50 minutes on the hold. Now after two months when I call it doesn't even ring. Is this even a real airline or a hoax?

### "was worth flying with them"
I had a good experience flying with them. I had priority boarding and it works really fine with them. They helped me to do the check-in at the airport. I can say that the seats were not so comfortable and the food on board is really expensive, but taking in consideration their flight prices it was worth flying with them.

### "they refused to board him on the plane"
I had a direct flight for my son scheduled on the 25th of June which was cancelled and I tried several times to contact them to change the date for a different flight. The customer services was very poor and they had an unprofessional language and approach. Finally, I managed to change the flight for my son for the 2nd July, a direct flight as well. It was impossible to find on their website the information regarding the documents needed for a child to travel with them, so I had multiple conversations over the phone with them to make sure we have all the documentation needed for check in and there will not be any problem before. Their also requested a fee for "special assistance" as my son was under age. Everything was paid and added to my sons ticket, priority boarding, luggage and the special assistance. With two days before the flight to be due, I have received an email saying that the flight schedule is changed due to operational reasons and the flight will have a commercial stop at Bucharest and there will be a six hours stay between the flights. I accepted that even if the 3 hours flight became now 11 hours flight. On the 2nd July, my son grandparents took him to the Cluj Napoca airport, a four hours journey for them. They went to the check in office to do the checks and his grandfather asked them what is going to happen in Bucharest because there are 6 hours between the next flight and if is someone to look after my son in all this time. They realised there is a mistake and actually they don't have staff to look after my son in airport and they contacted Bucharest for an opinion. After two hours of stress for me as a mother and my son, they refused to board him on the plane because they had no staff to look after him even if the service was added on his ticket. I tried myself to contact the airport from Bucharest but at 10 pm was nobody there and impossible to reach someone over the phone. Also they don't have opening hours over the weekend. This is ridiculous! They created a big drama for my family and myself offering services which they cannot comply. I

### "great customer service"
Cluj-Napoca Airport to Dublin Airport. I mention that Valentina and her colleagues had great customer service, we were very well treated, making our experience wonderful. Also a good flight time. I'm impressed and happy to schedule my next flight with Blue Air airline.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Not Verified |  Worst airline company that I have ever had the misfortune to deal with, they cancelled the flight, 2 days before departure, I tried calling numerous times, I sent them emails and to this day not a single answer from them. Would not recommend. Avoid at all costs.

### "I wrote countless emails and requests"
Not Verified |  Even if this company belongs to my country, my review is very weak. After they canceled a flight for me in September 2020, I haven't received any money back until now. I wrote countless emails and requests, but no one noticed me! Shame on this company, the most unprofessional there is!

### "deeply disappointed and dissatisfied"
Not Verified |  The airline introduced a totally absurd rule regarding all passengers having to seal their luggage in plastic wrap. What is absolutely lovely about this is that they don’t let you check in your luggage unless it’s wrapped (in some airports they allow it however, so they even aren’t good about following their own rule). Now imagine being in an airport with a single wrapping center where you can only pay cash and where there is no ATM. A full flight of people having to spend a lot of time wrapping and searching all of their pockets, hoping they have enough cash left. A very “beautiful” experience related with a totally understandable rule. The company does not offer any explanation for this request (as far as I know they are the only ones requesting this) and I can only assume they are playing a game in collaboration with some wrapping companies in order to find another way to steal money from tourists. Very elegant Blue Air - I am deeply disappointed and dissatisfied.

### "not willing to give back the money"
Athens to Larnaca. The airline cancelled the flight and not willing to give back the money after 6 months. No answers, simply stole the money and looks like they can do it without any repercussions.

### "they are simply ignoring my messages"
Blue Air cancelled my flight, and even though I have submitted a refund request on their site they are simply ignoring my messages. This is literally stealing and they know it! Will never ever use Blue Air, nor should anyone else!

### "has been promising to refund us for flights they cancelled for a year now"
Not Verified |  This company has been promising to refund us for flights they cancelled for a year now! Every time we phone, it’s another month, another three months. Lately they haven’t even bothered giving us a timeline, they just say they don’t know when they will refund us. They have just received an emergency bail out from the EU. They are certainly not using the money to refund customers! We have asked to speak to a manager, but apparently they are “busy helping customers with real problems”.

### "you can’t get a refund"
Not Verified |  Liverpool to Bucharest. Don’t use Blue Air as you can’t get a refund. We have been trying since June. Emails are not replied to and there is no way to contact any one by phone. The voucher given is unusable.

### "Covid regulations not being respected"
No possibility for online checkin, waiting time at the checkin counter minimum 1 hour. Covid regulations not being respected as can be seen in the picture. They have created a crowd of 300 people waiting in line in stead of allowing online checkin. I paid extra for "Priority", they don't have such a think at the counter. Terrible service!

### "I wish I had read the reviews before"
Not Verified |  Awful experience. I can't explain how angry I am. I paid nearly £500 for a comfort pack to fly with my wife and my little daughter. With this pack you should get a priority boarding, extra legroom seat 23kg baggage and 2 other bags on board and apart from the luggage, I haven't received any of the benefits I should have get so no priority boarding and no extra legroom seats for us. I've been in the queue with the baby for half an hour and nobody cared. Same awful experience on our return flight as well. Another awful experience was when I bought a flight for my family, I've been charged but I haven't received the flight confirmation and there is no way of reaching them on none of the 3 numbers given on their website, nor by email, nor by messenger or Instagram page. I'll never fly with them again even if I will need to pay more for a flight with another airline. Avoid at all cost. I wish I had read the reviews before.

### "charged me 70 euro for a bag"
Bucharest to Larnaca. They charged me 70 euro for a bag. Because it was bigger than their size by 2 cm. Also, the personnel in gate control were very very rude.

### "charged us 80€ for a bag"
Bucharest to Tel Aviv. They charged us 80€ for a bag just because it was bigger than their size by 2 cm. Its the first time i saw something like this! Unbelievable! I dont recommend to any body this company.

### "worst customer service ever"
Dublin to Bucharest. Flight was initially delayed by over 9 hours and caused us to miss out on one night at our hotel. By far the worst customer service ever. They charge a premium on calling them, view and ignore messages to their Facebook Messenger and do not adhere to their own time frames that they provide you. Would never fly with them again or recommend to anybody.

### "70 euro for the little bags"
Iasi to Munich, I had just hand luggage, just a rucksacks, to check-in everything was alright, they didn't said anything, like "hey the Rucksacks is to big or not good", then to the gates control everything was alright no one said anything. I was shocked when I saw that before boarding in the plane, the last control place with 30 Min before departure with a lot of people waiting they started measuring hand luggage. Is just funny, because are existing this type of baggage with a standard measure, exact with what the rules of the airplane line are asking for and this bags or not enough good to pass in this special support for baggage. Then we paid 70 euro for the little bags. Really disappointed.

### "truly dreadful airline"
Not Verified |  Bucharest to Luton. A truly dreadful airline. I paid money for speedy boarding but there was no queuing system and no announcement. The company is now refusing to refund me for this as they say there was an announcement. Also, where my partner was sat in the front row he could not see the safety demonstration. Ground staff and stewards are rude. Planes are very old and the toilet door didn't work. Seats are so cramped you can barely move.

### "ground staff is really rude"
Cluj Napoca to Dublin. Blue air is a company which is just ripping off money of the passengers, they are changing their cabin bag allowance measure with -3cm so people who are having cabin approved bags can pay extra 70€. Most of the low cost airlines cabin bag measures are 55cmX40cmX23cm but Blue Air changed this to 55cmX40cmX20cm. So bare in mind this whenever you are purchasing a blue air light tickets thinking how much you will save maybe you will end up spending more. Also ground staff is really rude they are just asking for money and telling passengers to make a complain on the website. I guess it’s not the best marketing strategy.

### "Everything was perfect"
Copenhagen to Bucharest with Blue Air. Everything was perfect. The flight took off earlier than scheduled. Everything went smoothly and extremely efficient. The plane was in good condition and clean.

### "one of the worst airlines"
I think this may be one of the worst airlines I have flown with for some time. I initially booked my flight on the basis of the basic fare without luggage and thought that it was fairly reasonable for a no frills flight. However i needed to add luggage later on and saw that it was over £65 each way. This did not include seat selection or any other benefit so I saw online that you could upgrade your ticket to include luggage, seat selection and meals. I decided to do this as it seemed that it would offer more comfort and if i was going to pay so much extra for luggage, i may as well include the others. The meals had to be preordered but i did not get what i ordered. You had to pay separately for drinks other than water. The waiting time for check in was a disgrace and i was in a queue for approx 90 minutes on my return journey and only passed through security whilst the plane was boarding which meant a rush through the airport to catch my plane. This was very stressful and then the "Premium" upgrade i had paid for did not include any priority boarding or any such benefit. The flight left on time and landed in good time. However it took over 45 minutes until i could pick up my luggage despite a very short queue in passport control. The staff were polite but all in all, i thought it was a horrible experience which worked out very expensive. My flight to Cyprus in the end cost more than i have paid for some long haul flights to the USA and SE Asia at almost £400 with luggage and meals included. I would recommend that you check the luggage prices and to steer clear of the food! I will not be using this airline again.

### "rude and incompetent staff"
Bucharest to Cologne I paid a reservation ticket for preferential seat but at check in another random seat without explanation was assigned to me. No one answered until now to my request to refund the money. Both on-board and check-in Blue Air staff need to learn to communicate. Extremely rude and incompetent staff.

### "mean ground staff"
Not Verified |  Larnaca to Athens. Unfriendly and mean ground staff with a LOT of attitude during all stages of check in (not available online! ), I was asked to pay 70 euros extra for a small laptop case I had in my hand in addition to my also small backpack, they told me if it was something bought at the duty free I wouldn’t have to pay. During flight not even water is offered.

### "staff are indifferent to very rude."
Luton to Bucharest. Even one is too much. Both the outbound flight and the return flight were delayed. Their airplanes are very old and scruffy and the legroom is very limited. We paid extra for emergency exit seats but on the way back we got ordinary seats without any explanation. On top of that they have reclining seat allowing inconsiderate people to make it even more uncomfortable when they demand to recline. The staff are indifferent to very rude. This company makes Ryanair and easyjet look premium.

### "I don't recommend this company"
Iasi to Luton. The most unwise staff. They are very arrogant and does not let you have even a bag with medicines and personal documents. I don't recommend this company at all.

### "they are never on time"
Not Verified |  Bucharest to Lyon. I've been flyong woth Blue air for over 5 years because i don't have any alternative, other companies don't operate my route. Unfortunately, Blue Air are not good and my biggest complaint is the fact that they are never on time. In over five years, I have never been on time with them, it's disgusting. Also, they call themselves low-cost but they have the same prices as a national airline. If i had other options I would definitely try them.

### "Over 2 hrs delay so far"
Not Verified |  Dublin to Bucharest. Worst experience of my life. Over 2 hrs delay so far with no mentioning on what the situation is. Absolutely no involvement from the airline to make the situation better. Avoid by all means.

### "Worst experience in my life"
Not Verified |  Lisbon to Bucharest. Worst experience in my life. No online checkin available, extremely bad service. One person was trying to check a cart car and 2 small garden trees and frighted with with the checkin person for 1 hr while everybody else was waiting so we barely made it. Extremely bad organizing, we had to wait outside near the plane to get in. Whey they took us out before having everything prepared is a mystery. There were 2 entrances the plane but initially they forced everybody to use the first one just to change their minds midway so people already on the stairs were going back down to go to the end of the plane. People were allowed with too much luggage and in the end I had to fly with one backpack under the seat and one on my knees. It was just incredible. I just felt mistreated and I sweared myself never to travel with this company again. And it's constantly like this. Worst flight yet but I already traveled 10 times with Blue Air and it was never an ok experience. The staff tries their best but seams to be all inexperienced and juniors, with no experience ones to guide them. I am yet to find a worse airline company.

### "disappointed and disgusted"
Absolutely disappointed and disgusted with this airline! On the way to Cluj from Dublin the staff was  lovely and I had no issues with a handbag + my allowed and extra paid for 10kg cabin luggage! On the way to Dublin from Cluj the airport staff was absolutely disappointing. They made me force my handbag into my cabin luggage and while doing so I cracked my laptop  I had to put away my medication and I was allowed to carry on only my bottle of water. And I was not the only one. A couple of elderly woman have been treated with the same disrespect. Made them unpack and pac again everything. I paid everything extra to make sure I dont have a hassle.

### "most unpleasant experience"
Larnaca to Birmingham. The most unpleasant experience in a year of flying 2-3 times / week with numerous airlines all over Europe! Rude staff, given misinformation from staff, policies applied apparently at random, and €95 to be allowed to take my handbag on the flight - was told verbally €90 while sign showed €60 and actual was €95. Checked in online but it didn’t give a boarding card so had to queue! Nobody at the service desk to accept the payment! Swissport staff at Larnaca airport were also shockingly rude despite Blue Air staff sending me to them! Will go to any length to avoid Blue Air in the future and will file official complaint with my corporate travel agency also as attitude and company are so appallingly bad.

### "Terrible experience"
Larnaca to Athens. Terrible experience. I had to pay 60€ for my 10kg baggage because my personal Purse didn’t fit in it. In the site they describe the size of baggage you can have on board, but how can you imagine that your small purse with your wallet, phone etc counts as an extra bag! Employees quite rude, the seat of the flight adequate for people less than 1.70 and 65kg and even for the water you need to pay. On top of all, their fares are as high as those of the other companies, making so unclear the fact that Blue Air is a low cost company!

### "never again with Blue Air"
LCA-ATH, OB 5361. By luck I was 3h before my flight at LCA and tried to check in. No check in machine was working/operating and instead I had to wait in a huge queue to check in by a teller on the airline operator/representative! Amazingly after standing - lined up with many others for 2 hours we made complaints. The teller ignored us when we asked to have someone else to assist with check in so queue was split equally. Flight delayed at LCA. On the airplane: No space at all for my luggage - a simple notebook to put it over my seat - because there was no check at all from the crew before on boarding. As a result, overweight and oversize luggage occupied all the space above the seats. The air hostess tried to rearrange luggage and almost squeezed a huge bag on my notebook. When I complained she asked me to put the notebook under my seat. I said I paid also for a hand carried luggage which is normal size / weight and asked her to put the heavy bag somewhere else. Instead she put my bag somewhere else and I had to find it when we arrived. ATH-LCA, OB5162. Check in is available up to 12h before flight. This information is not stated on the ticket! No other main air carrier or point to point destinator has such a hilarious policy! Normally you can checkin 2-3h before take off, in some cases like Aegean even 45' before flight and this info is provided clearly on the ticket! I was flying 10.00 from ATH, on 19 June. Tried to check-in using their website on the 18th of June around 22.30 but their system stated that online check in is closed. Came to ATH on the Blue Air operator around 9.15 on the 19 June with printed the ticked and asked to check in. The operator/representative of the Blue Air company rudely informed me that I should be 2 hours before and there was nothing to be done - that was it I lost the flight while being 45 mins before. I searched using Expedia and Petas.gr on 13.30 in the same day - 19 June - and I bet that Blue Air recycles seats on their flights probably from those that already bought a ticket but not have already checked in 12h before flight. For example I found that in the same day 19 June 19/2019 20.45 ATH - 22.30 LCA they sell seats for 170$. I am wondering how this guy who buys the ticket from Expedia now say in 12.21 for a flight on 20.45 will manage to check in since e-check in is closed, never again with Blue Air.

### "10 kgs free carry on luggage"
Larnaca to Athens. I've travelled with Blue Air many times before and they decided that from now on they will be charging for your purse extra. So i have 10 kgs free carry on luggage and if my purse does not fit in my luggage i must pay 60 euros - not to mention the attitude of the staff! Blue air is the worst company by far and i prefer to buy a more expensive ticket from another company.

### "has very bad services"
Not Verified |  Bucharest to Paris. Blue Air is a low cost company which has very bad services (online check-in, boarding, baggage attendants, flight attendants, etc). I do  not recommend this company and I will never use again.

### "were told to put your bag in"
Bucharest to Hamburg. I flew for many years with Blue Air, but the services, cleanliness, staff and aircraft are getting worse. As well, the prices are going up, but without seeing any improvement. My last flight was the worst possible, starting from check-in staff ( ou can't do any online check-in for most of the flights to Germany). As usual, politeness isn't something that their staff is able to show. But this time the lady was super rude, and refused to answer some of my questions. She asked me at imperative to squeeze my purse in the trolley, I've done my part, then I went through the security checks, duty free and I ended up at the boarding desk. Then I've noticed that my ticket was marked with a exclamation mark. I ended up at the boarding desk with my purse out (i needed my wallet). Then the lady from the desk started shouting at me: you cannot board, you were told to put your bag in. I explained why I have it out and the lady continued yelling at me. It was embarrassing. The plane was filthy, dirty toilets, poor service. This was last time for me when I will allow them to treat me like this.

### "no free meals left"
Luton to Larnaca. It stated on the return tickets that free meals will be offered. When we were onboard the flight and the meals arrived I called a cabin staff and showed our tickets stating clearly that we had 2 free meals. They said we were not on the list, and we continued to ask staff for the meal. They said there were no free meals left to offer and we were not on the list. I answered back that this was not my problem. They finally offered us a coffee to shut us up.

### "I had a good experience"
Bucharest to Luton. I had a good experience with Blue Air. They were prompt and on time. Landed a lot earlier than scheduled which was great. However, the aircraft was old and falling apart. There is no mobile check in and there website is clunky, so a bit behind the times on that front.

### "Ridiculous service and website"
Not Verified |  Barcelona to Bucharest. Ridiculous service and website! I tried 5 times with 5 different cards to pay for a checked in luggage and it was saying there is a mistake. The mistake was coming from their website! After struggling for two days i gave up on the idea and i took a small luggage. Upon boarding of the plane i was stopped for having my luggage and a computer bag. After almost breaking my computer i had to carry all of my things in my hands and only put the bag itself in the luggage. The result is the plane was full with little things everywhere - jackets, cables, computers, chargers just because the staff was so against the concept of a bag (purse bag not a big one). It was so annoying and frustrating. To make the whole experience better for the passengers the music playing in the plane while we waited to board was some intense folklore rhythm that made the situation even more tense.

### "a delay of more than 2 hours"
Larnaca to Athens. Huge delays. On arrival at the airport we were informed about a delay of 30 to 45 min. At the end we suffered a delay of more than 2 hours and we were loaded in the bus after long time standing in the boarding gate and after we arrives in front of the airplane we waited there more than 10 min and the bus turned back to the waiting room of the gate. They announced a breakdown of the airplane and that we had the option of flying after more than six hours. All those hours horrible services, no water no food. I decided not to wait and claim the money I have given to them . They did not want to give that. They overcharged more 60 euros for 1 kilo overweight in my luggage. I m never going to fly with this company.

### "disgusting customer service"
Luton to Bucharest. Absolutely disgusting customer service. I made a booking for a morning flight from Luton and in the confirmation it was the afternoon flight. I called them straight to mention there is an error and I had the screenshots from my phone to prove I booked the morning flight not the afternoon one. I had to send my proof on an email address and I had to wait. more then 24 hours. Yesterday the lady said that I have to pay 17 pounds to make the change or I can wait until we get a response. I said I will wait as I don't want to pay for something what I already paid for. Today after I called them again (yesterday I called them 4-5 times to see if there is an answer yet) the lady said now I have to pay 51 pound as my request was rejected and today the price for the same flight has gone up. Yesterday nobody mentioned to me that the 17 pound can change. I am traveling alone with 2 small children. That's why I booked the morning flight as I did not want to arrive to Bucharest at midnight and then travel an other 3 hours back to my home town. When I said to the lady that I want to talk to her manager as she made a mistake by not mentioning to me that the 17 pounds can change then she shut the phone on me. Ever since nobody picked up the phone on the same number. Since then I called Romania and Belgium as well but it seems nobody can help me. Absolutely disgusting and I'm fuming that something like this can happen.

### "experienced this scam"
Iasi to Paris. Please pay attention when booking online from their website! They add 10 euro (on average) at the price of the ticket that was initially displayed when you first searched for it in case you don't book it right away. This happens even if you search twice for the same flight in the same day. I think it is the 10th time when this happens to me, so I am sure there is no accident. I was receiving several errors when trying to make my online pay and after refreshing the page, the total amount to pay was 30 euro higher although I haven't modified anything, I didn't add any extra service etc. I encourage everyone who has experienced this scam to write a negative post and hopefully, they will stop. But this kind of practices show me that they are not a respectable company.

### "a good experience"
Hamburg to Bucharest. All in all a good experience. Blue Air is your average budget airline. Check in went flawlessly. The provided plane was a bit old (26 years at the time of travel) but nothing felt old in there. I felt safe the whole trip, even tho I had concerns before the flight. The cabin was nice and clean. The cabin crew was nice and friendly, smiling and helping. I really don’t have anything to complain about, except that the seats were a bit uncomfortable. But for 52 Euro One Way there is really nothing to complain about. I would fly Blue Air again.

### "The most disappointing flight"
Flew Blue Air from Luton to Bucharest. The most disappointing flight I’ve ever had. The staff were brilliant, but I felt like the aircraft was coming apart. My seat was broken, moving backward and forwards all the time. The seat in front of me had a crack on the back (right bottom). Window blinds were not fully closing. Never again.

### "cannot expect any help"
Glasgow to Bucharest return. Blue air for the greediness of £8, placed all three of us in three corners of the plane, on both routes. Flown lots of budget airlines but they have crossed even RyanAir on this one. Staff at Glasgow Airport was great who managed to help us sit together, while with airline/airport staff from Romania, you cannot expect any help from them at all. This was the case for every other family with small children. Although they are cheap, i would avoid them at all cost if you are travelling on a family Holiday.

### ""
Rome to Bucharest. The flight was delayed and we were waiting in the queue for more than an hour as per the boarding time shown in the screen. When I asked about the delay and told the lady (who came 45 minutes late), she was very rude and told me to sit down and "stand up" when I hear the announcement. There were no apology or anything about the delayed flight. I am currently waiting in the queue, still there is no announcement.

### "How disgusting"
Alghero to Rome. I am wary of flying with this company again. They charged me 200 euros because according to them I bought a special rate valid only for residents in Sardinia. Apparently, however, speaking at the ticket office, in the month in which I booked they had problems on their ticket booking site and some travelers traveled the same at a discounted rate even though they were not Sardinians, but I did not have to pay. I will appeal. How disgusting. IT: Diffido a volare di nuovo con questa compagnia. Mi hanno addebitato 200euro perché secondo loro ho comprato una tariffa speciale valida solo per residenti in Sardegna. A quanto pare però, parlando alla biglietteria, nel mese in cui ho prenotato avevano dei problemi sul loro sito di prenotazione biglietti e alcuni viaggiatori hanno viaggiato lo stesso a tariffa agevolata anche non essendo sardi, ma io no ho dovuto pagare. Farò ricorso. Che schifo

### "a terrible experience"
Flew from Bucharest to Larnaca on 24th August. The flight was delayed by four hours, nobody could give us an explanation for the reason the flight was delayed, the personnel on the ground were rude and the passengers moved from a gate to another. Overall a terrible experience.

### "I requested a refund"
Birmingham to Cluj. After a flight schedule change and then a cancellation I requested a refund. Now 2.5 months later I'm still waiting for my money and BlueAir only has excuses. I now not only lost money from my booking but also my holiday reservation.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Bucharest to Birmingham. I purchased Premium service which entailed to an Extra Leg room seat and complimentary meal for 2 passengers. The aircraft was changed in the last moment and we the seats which originally were Extra Leg room and no longer. Although the Extra Legroom seats were still available those were given to other passenger who did not had a Premium service, nor we have received a complimentary meal. Worst experience ever.

### "sandwich and drinks free of charge"
This was my fourth trip on this airline and I am surprised with the quality and punctuality of this flight. The aircraft was clean, and surprisingly for a low cost airline we were offered a sandwich and drinks free of charge. The captain kept us posted on the flight path and all in all this was a very good flight. The in flight magazine and safety instructions, were clean and tidy. Both departure and arrival at jetways and not via buses as used by other airlines on this route.

### "rude and unprofessional"
Luton to Bucharest. Awful service right from the check in, rude staff on ground. As a photographer I travel with a lot of kit that can’t be checked in. It’s the only airline that made me check in parts of my kit. Worse, they couldn’t care any less and were rude and unprofessional. They were only checking some luggage of some passengers so were completely inconsistent in their approach. There was more trouble with hand luggage where at the boarding gate passengers were told they had to check in their hand luggage due to the lack of space in the overhead lockers. However, that was untrue as on boarding (and plain refusing to check in the rest of my hand luggage) it turned out there was more than enough storage space. Chaotic, disorganised and unhelpful. First and last time with Blue Air.

### "delayed 1.5 hours due to technicality"
Flew Rome to Liverpool with Blue Air. Overall a good experience but outbound flight delayed 1.5 hours due to technicality which could have happened to any airline, but it would be good to give the captain some lessons in honesty and clarity, eg: don't say we're on our way in a couple of minutes, when it's 20+ don't say very soon when it's not.

### "flight was eventless and smooth"
Flew Madrid to Bucharest. The flight was eventless and smooth, flight attendants were friendly and helpful. The plane was clean and the seats were comfortable and had adjusting head rests. They even gave passangers a little free meal, as the flight took place at dinner time. Blue Air is taking low cost aviation to a whole new level.

### "planes are old, noisy and not clean"
Flew Rome to Larnaca via Fiumicino. I do not think Blue Air should be rated anything more than 2 stars, the planes are old, noisy and not clean. Flight attendants are generally impolite and not professional. Food onboard is best avoided. Their website can not be used for online check in as it keeps crashing over and over, leading you to go to the airport three hours earlier just to avoid the middle seat. The ground staff in FCO and LCA are always friendly, but that is because they are not the company itself. When I am dealing with the ground staff in Bucharest I am only wishing I had chosen another company. I only fly with them due to a lack of a viable alternative, (Aegean flies through Athens, but their comfort does not comes cheap). Overall I even find Ryanair to be more pleasurable.

### "no information was available"
I flew with Blue Air on Jan 19th from Liverpool to Rome. This flight was delayed by 14 hours - which is a significant delay as I was taking a short city break. The flight was due to leave at 7.15am - so was at the airport very early. Initially everything went smoothly from check-in through security to the queing to board the flight! Problems started when we did not board at the planned time - with the first issue being one of communication. No advice or information was made available to passengers that the flight was being delayed. Eventually, the flight status was updated to show a delay but no staff could be found to provide a reason or manage expectations as to how long the delay would be. As the day progressed, a voucher was handed out for refreshments (which did not cover the cost of the cheapest meal) but no information was available beyond what could be read on the screen of the expected departure time. It was not until mid afternoon that some staff did make themslves available and advise that the cause of the problems were technical issues and at this point, they were unsure if the flight would leave at all. Eventually, Blue Air did commit that a flight would leave that day to Rome and we started boarding just before 8pm. Once we were all seated, just as I thought we might depart, other passengers were boarded who were told to sit anywhere. It was only at this point, we found out 2 flights had been merged, with the second group of passengers bound for Bucharest. It took a considerable amount of time for this group to board and find seats - straining tempers of a number of passengers as groups were being split up and the air crew took a back seat during the confusion, leaving people to seat themselves. Eventually we departed at 9pm. During the flight, the aircrew were not particularly helpful or communicative with what was happening. I appreciate that technical issues can happen and delays do occur but it is entirely within the power of the airline to inform passengers with what is happening and give regular updates. By the time Blue Air did start speaking to people (afternoon for a 7am scheduled departure), tempers were strained - so why wait so long? And why didnt they tell us flights were being merged. Due to the length of the delay I fully expect compensation to be available for this flight, however to date, I have had zero responses to my emailed requests. Not impressed. Badly handled Blue Air.

### "nobody allowed to use the bathrooms"
Blue Air flight 6201 from Bucharest to Iasi was my last of four on December 5th. I had left Toronto 19 hours earlier and I was looking forward to a warm family reunion in my hometown. Austrian Airlines had set an outstanding precedent in terms of service quality, so the treatment received on this last flight came as a shock. Long story short, nobody on that flight was allowed to use the bathrooms during the entire trip. Under the pretense that the seat belt light was on, those who had the audacity to solicit the privilege of attending to nature's urges, were turned back to their seat, shamed over the pager and threatened with a fine! Notwithstanding the seat belt light, the crew were free to walk about, serve snacks and drinks, and strut unhindered while the passengers had no choice. I do not wish to speculate on the reasons but this experience was a reminder as to why I left my country 25 years ago. Undoubtly a cold shower to wash off my nostalgic return-to-motherland fantasies. I was able to put my physiology on hold and successfully control my bowels, but I wonder what the elderly or the children on that flight did to manage the situation. Except for a tail between their legs, the victims yielded no protests or complaints, so I decided to write this review to put the story out there, in case I'm the only one providing feedback.

### "very clean, fantastic crew"
I recently flew with BlueAir from Liverpool to Alicante. I had never heard of BlueAir before and was slightly worried about flying with them thinking it would be an old aircraft and crew you couldn’t understand, and you would be lucky to arrive on time. But they were brilliant, a fairly new B737, very clean, fantastic crew, very friendly and professional, nothing too much trouble. And very surprised to get either a free hot or cold drink. Both flights were early, so overall very impressed and will definitely book BlueAir again..

### "never plan to arrive on time"
Do not waste your time! Make sure you never make plans to arrive on time. Cluj-Napoca to Birmingham is a "pit stop" from the Bucharest to Birmingham flight, so its more like a train journey, when you board the plane there are people waiting inside already. And its like the 5th time in a row this flight is late. Cheap and the only one to Birmingham is the reason why I have used it 5 times, but will have to search for alternatives. Apart from this, there are no seats available in the waiting area, so plan 4 hours of standing. Might be good for your fitness.

### "aircraft old and not clean"
When we boarded the aircraft the air conditioning was on full and was generating very cold air. After complaining to staff, they said it will stop after we depart, but by that time we were freezing. The aircraft was old and not clean. The headrest on the seat was in very bad condition. Furthermore, the aircraft was noisy during the entire trip in comparing with other more modern aircraft.

### "very pleasantly surprised"
Rome to Liverpool. I was very pleasantly surprised by the far from low cost experience. Very clean aircraft. Good Legroom. Friendly staff. Entertainment playing on the screens. Complimentary sandwich, which was very good and soft drinks too. Overall it was an extremely pleasant experience and one that actually bettered the soft product of British Airways as you'll pay extra for food and drinks on short-haul and won't get any entertainment. Only negative I can think of is the airlines website, which doesn't do them any favours.

### "should have informed me earlier"
I was going to fly Larnaca to Cluj‐Napoca. Everything was going on smoothly until the moment I was about to board the plane. The crew told me that I needed a return ticket in order to fly with Blue Air. While I understand that sometimes a return/exit ticket is needed, they should have informed me earlier during check-in instead one minute before boarding. So I was forced to buy a ticket that i was not going to use.

### "treated with utmost courtesy and respect"
Flew from Liverpool to Rome. From entering the aircraft, when a stewardess placed my luggage in the overhead locker, to leaving the plane, I was treated with utmost courtesy and respect. Once airborne, sandwiches and drinks were offered (free of charge) and details of the flight were shown on screens visible from all seats. The aircraft was clean, comfortable, and had plenty of leg room, and the toilet facilities were clean and hygienic. I would have no hesitation with flying with Blue Air again, and would highly recommend.

### "disappointing experience with Blue Air"
Rome to Bucharest. Booked a flight for myself my wife and 2 children from Rome to Bucharest. Two hours prior departure at checkin we found out that on the reservation ticket, instead of my wife's last name was mine, although family name and date of birth were correct. The ground staff kept us waiting till closing time when they told us that we need to buy another full price ticket for my wife. Apart from keeping us waiting, after buying a new ticket we had to run to catch the flight. They were asked to give me both tickets reserved on my name and they said is not possible. Of course it wasn't possible, the extra ticket sold to my wife was one of my tickets (same seat no), so as conclusion I had to pay for one seat twice. All in all, I had a very bad, disappointing experience with Blue Air. There was no supervisor to talk to in Rome and the complain was given in Otopeni in written as there was no supervisor there as well with response time of 60 days.

### "awesome cabin staff service"
Lisbon to Torino. The flight was delayed 20 minutes, but the ground staff kept us informed of updates. The seats were OK, and sandwiches / drinks provided were good. What made this trip awesome was the cabin staff service. One staff even made some coffee just for my family when we asked for some. If other staff are half as good, the human touch will easily make up for other, sometimes systemic, low cost carrier shortcomings.

### "staff nice and friendly"
I recently had the pleasure to fly Blue Air again, and it was one of my best low-cost experiences. We actually boarded way earlier than expected, and were ready to take off ahead of the schedule! We were announced before departing that we will arrive some 20min earlier in Bucharest! The service was great, we even got drinks for free, which is unexpected for a low-cost service, and the staff was nice and friendly. No issues watsoever to report, all was well-organized and the attention for passengers' comfort was remarkable.

### "Do not fly with Blue Air!"
Do not fly with Blue Air! After cancelling the flight from Hamburg to Liverpool in early April 2017 (with about 2 hours notice period) it took them nearly 2 months to pay the compulsory compensation according to current EU law. I had to write a huge amount of E-Mails / complaints and it needed a law-suit threat to make them pay. They are still breaking valid law in not refunding any refreshments for the waiting time (about 12 hours) at the airport. All in all, I made very bad experiences with Blue Air. I am very sorry that I can not write a better review.

### "Very good value"
Liverpool to Milan Bergamo. Not a very full flight so had an entire row to myself. Aircraft wasn't very new, however took off on time. Offered a non alcoholic drink and 2 vegetarian sandwiches at no cost. Any other snacks were charged for. Very good value when I only paid £25 for a ticket.

### "excellent low cost air travel"
Flew Blue Air from Milan to Liverpool. First time to board this flight but our impression are 10/10. Excellent low cost air travel flights. We were unfortunately late to our gate and yet without any further ado the ground crew had given use a chance to board the plane. The service, the cabin crew are well dressed and clean so was inside the aircraft. We expected to pay for beverages but it was free. We had a choice to have a nice sandwich and hot or cold drinks. Flights went smoothly, no delays. It is a Romanian airline but cabin crews are well mannered and speak different languages.

### "pleasant flight on a Sunday"
Bucharest to Florence, a pleasant flight on a Sunday morning, splendid manned by the pilots, few mins. early departed and 25 mins early landing, smooth and with messages from cockpit regarding the route. Good legroom on the 2nd row. Downsides: the cabin crew attitude (professional and efficient, but not friendly and seeming to be bored) and the cabin look, strongly showing the aircraft's age. I recommend Blue Air for city-breaks from/ to Bucharest.

### "not a great experience"
Larnaca to Rome via Bucharest, the airplane was an old 737 that smelled bad. Tickets were 110 euro for both flights so I did not expect any luxuries. It had been a full flight but we embarked quickly. Food and drinks were offered, asked for the wine which was terrible. Cabin crew was fun and polite and smilled. I had a short time for my connection flight which the cabin crew promised me I would get as a representative of the airline would wait for me. Upon arrival the representation of the airline told me to "run to get my flight" with no assistance to where the gate was or an escort to the plane. Second plane was much newer but worse seats thought. Overall not a great experience. Would fly again if I had no alternative.

### "last time I will fly with them"
Cluj-Napoca to Bucharest. I flew with Blue Air several times, hoping things will get better, but every time things got worst! From a minimum of 2 hrs delay, the delay increased last time to 2hrs 45 mins. And everytime they blame it on the weather, but other companies do not have this problem and they do not have such long delays. They somehow manage to delay their flights in such a way so you do not have the chance to get a refund or compensation - only frustration and anger!! This will be the last time I will fly with them.

### "amazing price 39,98 EUR return"
Athens to Larnaca return with Blue Air. Did not use e-check in, as I did not have access to a printer, however this was not a problem, as check in is provided at the counters was free. Very small lines and quick service. Embarkation done through a bridge 3 out of 4 times at a relatively quick manner. A lot of passengers taking oversized luggage. Both flights left and arrived on time. On board free service included a sandwich, wafer, a drink, a newspaper and a candy before landing - all that at the amazing price of 39,98 EUR return - no extra services purchased.

### "recommend based on price"
Larnaca to Athens with Blue Air. Not bad for what we paid for this short flight. Crew provided good service, free snack which was a pleasant surprise. However, the aircraft was old - very old - 80s interior, toilet falling apart, tray table paint chipped, seat put together with tape. Blue Air have no new aircraft and the average age of their fleet is 15 years. I would recommend based on price.

### "would fly with Blue Air again"
Luton to Larnaca and I can't fault the flight or service from Blue Air. A free meal was also provided. The crew were helpful, and I would fly with Blue Air again. Seat comfort was better than easyjet and Ryanair

### "better level of service than expected"
Luton to Larnaca and I can't fault this flight or the service from Blue Air. The queue at Luton could have been managed better but after that, Blue Air provided a better level of service than I expected from an unknown budget airline and we had an unexpected free meal and a couple of drinks too. The crew were helpful at all times and I wouldn't hesitate to fly with Blue Air again.

### "low level of cabin crew service"
Flight OB1232 from Luton to Bucharest, from 6PM is always delayed 3 hours. I traveled twice with them in July : 1st of July and 20th of July and it was always the same problem. they never announced me about the delay even when I called the company in the morning in the day of the flight to confirm. The worst company ever, unreliable and low level of cabin crew service. I would recommend to avoid them if you can.

### "I don't recommend to use"
Barcelona to Bucharest. I don't recommend to use this company. I have traveled few times with them and almost always they are have delays and they don't provide any explanations. In my last flight some friends didn't know if they had seats in the plane - they put them on the "waiting list" even if they bought their tickets 2 months before. Bad service, the flight attendant had a rude attitude.

### "experience wasn't pleasant"
I thought I give Blue Air a go as it offered direct flight from Liverpool-Bucharest and as I go to Bucharest 2-3 times a year, direct flight was most appealing since I mostly get flights from Manchester to Bucharest (connection flights Germany), so the direct flight appealed. My experience wasn't a pleasant one, even though I paid for allocated seating (extra) the air hostess asked me to change seats, (4 rows away from my originally seating I paid for) because a passenger with a baby choose to not purchase a seat for the baby, meaning baby would of been in mother harms all the way, (cost saving by the passenger), but as I was travelling alone and spare empty seat next to me, I was asked in Romanian/broken English by the air hostess would I move to another seat so the lady with the baby could occupy 2 seats. I wasn't pleased, since the passenger choose to cost cut by not paying for 2 passengers and only paying for 1, again Romanian cost cutting. During the flight, the airline offered inflight meals (at cost) I prepaid for my meals when booking, I chose from the menu, and what I received wasn't quite like the picture menu, it was a hot meal overcooked and food was dry. I also noticed the air hostess lacked politeness and looked like the job was a chore... but saying that, the only positive was the price of the ticket was extremely cheap compared to other low cost airlines. I guess pay for what you get, and I feel if you don't mind low standards to get to your destination and without connections and got travel on a budget then I would recommend blue air, but I wouldn't travel with them again. I went from Liverpool-Bucharest and online checkin wasn't available - which only leaves the passengers queuing at the checkin desk, which Liverpool only had 1 checkin desk and Bucharest had 4 checkin desk - I was queuing almost 1 hour to check my baggage in while some passengers haggled luggage weight with checkin staff, which seems common practice at Optopeni airport.

### "I am very impressed"
Luton to Larnaca with Blue Air. I wasn't too sure what to expect from this airline after reading the reviews, but I can honestly say I am very impressed. I travelled with my daughter and two grandchildren, one aged 4 and the other aged 2. When we checked in we were offered to have our cabin cases put in the hold free of charge - this was very helpful as we were landing at midnight and it's a struggle getting off the plane with 4 cabin bags plus 2 small children. As we boarded the plane the staff asked my grandchildren if they would like to go into the cockpit to have a look at where the pilots sit, this was great fun for them. The leg room on the plane was pretty average, no better or worse than any other airline I've been on. An hour into the flight we were offered free drinks which were a choice of wine and a good variety of soft drinks, a short time later the staff offered a free meal. The meal was good. The cabin crew were lovely, couldn't fault any of them. We were offered a second drink later in the flight. The plane was clean. I would definitely book with Blue Air again. Half an hour before landing the staff went round to all the children and gave them stickers.

### "cabin crew were excellent"
I was not sure what to expect from Blue Air, but my experience with them was a surprisingly good one. The ticket was very cheap on this extremely popular route from Larnaca to Athens, the flight was on time and the Cabin Crew were excellent, with nice free snacks and drinks and were always eager to help passengers. The food choice was very good for this morning flight, yogurt with honey, a strawberry cream and a fresh sandwich. The aircraft was very clean although a bit old (I guess this is why the seats were not very comfortable but this is the only negative thing I can report, and it was not at all a problem on such a short flight. I can say the flight was overall very comfortable even though the seats could be better). A very interesting free magazine was also offered to passengers and it was clear that it was designed for the passengers of this specific route, as it included interesting articles about Athens, things to do, and what to visit, furthermore, the magazine included interviews with the crew. Moreover a free newspaper was offered to any passenger who wanted one, and they offered caramels for landing. Only the low price of the ticket could remind you that Blue Air was a low cost airline! I am looking forward to flying with them again.

### "no different to EasyJet or Monarch"
Flew Blue Air from Luton to Larnaca return, I was super anxious about flying with them end of April/beginning of May 2016. I'd read bad reviews, the customer service, trying to email, message etc was bad, never got a reply. But staff at both airports were lovely, and check in went smoothly. Free meals, snacks, drinks etc. I would recommend them on this route. Seating was a little cramped but always is on the cheaper, more budget airlines, no different to EasyJet or Monarch.

### "any other passengers been charged?"
Blue Air is a low cost Romanian airline flying the Athens to Larnaca route twice per day, allowing 32 kg luggage if you pay extra. Most staff and pilots were Cypriots. No reason to complain apart for the delay of one hour on the return flight. What I fail to understand is the charge of what they call "special services" a charge never booked and never explained. Do they intentionally charge this so called "special services" to make some extra money or what? Have any other passengers been charged for such monkey money? Despite being low cost, they served free drinks and a sandwich.

### "everything was good"
Glasgow to Bucharest with Blue Air. Had to check in at airport for some reason, but other than that everything was good. Comfy seat with plenty of leg room, and a free in flight meal. Never seen that before on a budget airline flight that only cost £50. Would fly again.

### "not flying Blue Air again"
Athens to Larnaca with Blue Air, and the flight was acceptable, but the carry on policy is not acceptable. Do not make me pay 81 Euros to check carry on bags because of a 'one bag policy',  only for me to see people boarding the plane with 2 and even 3 bags. What otherwise would have been a decent flight (probably due to the fact it was a short hop), was spoiled. Doing this is how you squeeze a few more bucks of profit? Not with us. Not flying Blue Air again.

### "a terrible experience"
Bucharest to Dublin weith Blue Air, and me and my boyfriend had a terrible experience. Paying for choosing your seat? Forget it because you will not get it and if you ask why they will just say nothing. Have a baby stroller? Forget about pushing your kids around - you need to hold them or to pay some sort of extra luggage because you will only be harassed by the company staff and the flight will be delayed just for their amusement otherwise! I didn't go through this but I was waiting to get in the plane when that happened to someone in front of me - so after about 20 mins of cursing from this 'lovely, super trained' staff I dared to ask why are we being held behind for no reason and got some grief because I opened my mouth. Ii pressed one star on Value for money but I can't take it back  - they don't deserve that star, not even half of one.

### "friendly and professional crew"
Brussels to Bacau on Blue Air Boeing 737-300, an on time flight, nothing special to report. Friendly crew. Airplane was old but looked okay for it's age. The return was the same as the flight to Bacau. Clean airplane, friendly and professional crew. Food and drink services are a bit high but used to that since it's with most of the airlines. Lavatories however could have done with a bit of attention - all the paint was worn and the air wick that was taped to the wall wasn't a profesional look. Left on time, and arrived about 45 minuts ahead of time.

### Blue Air customer review
The seats are comfortable but flights are usually delayed with this company. The staff is friendly and talkative. I didn't try the cooked food but the prices for the snacks are ok.

### Blue Air customer review
I booked well in advance, and paid extra to reserve 4 seats for my party on the first row of the aircraft. When I checked-in, I was issued with boarding passes for 4 different seats allocated in completely differently parts of the aircraft. I pointed this out to the ground and cabin staff, but they refused to believe that I had booked and paid for the seats (I even showed them the email confirmation which included the seat numbers I had booked). The aircraft was ancient, the cabin crew rude and very badly presented.

### Blue Air customer review
First time flying with a low cost airline so I read a lot of reviews. Most of them are angry in general because they didn't take the time to do the online check-in or check the policy about the hand luggage so they paid at the airport. In the end it was pretty good and acceptable for short trips like LCA-ATH (an hour and a half). The only thing I didn't like was paying for choosing a seat online but at least it was my decision. Staff members are nice with a smile.

### Blue Air customer review
This was bar none the worst airline I have flown with. I checked in online the night before and in the morning I realized that I needed to add baggage to my reservation. The computer system automatically checked me out and didn't let me add baggage because it was less that 4 hours before the flight. That meant when I got to the airport I got smacked with both a baggage fee and a check in fee even though I had already checked in! The staff were rude snarky and went out of their way to be unhelpful. When paying the fee I had to get out of the check-in line and go to the ticketing office where the representative refused to give me change in euros and refused to let me use visa to pay which forced me to get out of line again and take out local currency with the ATM. Once checked-in we were informed that the flight would be an hour late due to maintenance issues. Past security we sat and were later informed that the flight would be delayed another 5 hours! This mean I would be missing my next connecting flight. We were forced to sign a document acknowledging that they were abiding by the E.U. rules of regulation before we were allowed to go back to the food court area or leave the airport. We were then told that the flight would be 7 hours delayed! In the end the flight was 8.5 hours delayed and the plane was kept at an inhumane temperature that felt like 0 degrees. We were not compensated in anyway and even when we got to the next airport and asked a different representative they said there was nothing they could do. It was a complete nightmare. For the sake of saving a few dollars to fly I tell you from experience it is not worth it. I will never fly with this company again.

### Blue Air customer review
Bucharest to Brussels (22/06/2014) and Rome to Bucharest (03/07/2014). Good prices. On-time boarding late departure not Blue Air's fault. Smooth flights old B-737 planes clean and seemed to be in good technical condition nice inflight magazine snacks/drinks for charge not overpriced. Professional and attentive cabin crew excellent pilots.

### Blue Air customer review
We flew Bucharest - Rome - Bucharest. Flight to Rome postponed for half of the day at the last minute. We received confirmation only 3 days before the flight. Return flight also postponed several hours a few days before the flight. In Rome we had to pay 8 Euro person for some security fee. We were not informed in advance of this additional payment. Staff not friendly at all. Do not recommend.

### Blue Air customer review
Bucharest to Larnaca Cyprus (return flight) in June 2013. This was only one part of a multi-city trip. In order to avoid any problems with luggage we paid on line to Blue-Air for one extra piece of luggage. Upon departure from Bucharest we were charged 15 Euros per person for check-in at the airport. When embarking the airplane the carry- on luggage was found not fit to Blue-Air carry-on box/cage and we were charged an extra 55 Euros. We had traveled with this same carry-on luggage from Chicago New York Amsterdam and Bucharest without any problem. The same luggage seemed to fit in the carry-on fitting cage in Larnaca for the flight back. The experience with the Blue Air check-in team in Bucharest was extremely disappointing not only to us but to many of the passengers and in fact with all these extra additions to the cost we would have been better of with Tarom or another proper airline - which we are sure we will on the next occasion. Your service in Bucharest was sub-par and will not be recommended.

### Blue Air customer review
We have recently flown from Bucharest Romania to Venice Italy on a flight that was originally scheduled to leave at 17.45 pm. Two days before departure they rescheduled it to leave at 0.40 the next day and they let us know by email. One day later the day before departure they rescheduled it for 22.40 but they forgot to change the date back - so a mess resulted with several passengers not showing up for the flight. We were lucky to go to the airport as they do not reply to phone calls and ask them if the flight was still scheduled for the original day and they confirmed it with only 5 hours delay. The rep apologized in person but we could have missed the flight if we believed the email which showed the next date! Completely unprofessional.

### Blue Air customer review
Sibiu - Stuttgart. Worst flight experience. Rude and aggressive personnel including the gentleman from boarding who targeted passengers like the police ("I want her checked" - referring to me and my carry on). I had to pay an additional 55e for my hand luggage because they didn't deem it fit (even though I always fly with the same bag!) as cabin luggage. Dismissive and denigrating attitude towards all passengers.

### Blue Air customer review
Dublin to Bucharest return with Blue Air in March 2013. Have to say no problems at all with the flights. Quick check-in in both Dublin and Bucharest. No issues with baggage (I had made sure that we complied with their specifications). They didn't seem too fussy about bag sizes going from Dublin - Bucharest but on return journey each carry-on bag was checked. Flights themselves were fine. Both departed and arrived more-or- less on time (despite snow in Bucharest). Booked seats at the front of the plane - no issues. The planes were quite warm both ways and the toilets could definitely do with modernising/replacement but that's a minor quibble. For Eur80 return I don't think you could beat them. Would definitely recommend. Website is not the best (as mentioned by earlier posters). Difficult to find e.g. how to add a bag after flight is booked. However their help desk replied to my email queries very quickly with clear concise instructions on how to add a bag.

### Blue Air customer review
London Luton - Bacau return. Long queues at Luton check-in which barely moved for 15 minutes until further desks were opened. Thereafter smooth. Boeing 737-400 virtually full in both directions. Dark blue leather seats slightly showing their age but interior otherwise fine including toilets. Drinks (including decent Romanian wine) available to purchase and staff seemed friendly. On return route there seemed to be wider selection of sandwiches and snacks on offer. Return flight delayed by 30 minutes with no explanation given (at least not in English). In general seemed perfectly adequate low-cost carrier (although my travelling companion who had bought the tickets at relatively short notice told me that they were not cheap).

### Blue Air customer review
Luton - Bucharest. Interesting to say the least. Plane is old and as such the seats are awful! My friend didn't even have to press to recline as it did it by itself during the whole journey!! Plus the plane was boiling hot. I can't wait for the return flight.

### Blue Air customer review
BGY-OTP and back. The first bad remark is about the website: slow complicated and inefficient. In Milan Bergamo the boarding was fair and those who booked and paid for their seat like me were allowed to board first. B737 is very old but the legroom better than Ryanair and the seat relatively comfortable. The crew were quite young but not very friendly. On the way back the boarding in Bucharest was chaotic and many people were trapped by an employee who checked the dimension of all baggage. Many were forced to pay 55 euros to load the luggage and very intense discussions took place between some passengers and the employees. In short flights were ok and we arrived on time on both legs. However they have to improve their ground services improve the website and make in sort to have a more friendly staff.

### Blue Air customer review
Luton to Bucharest Awful. Old 737-400 very tired and dirty booking was a nightmare everything was an extra including booking a seat so we didn't bother. On the way back and my wife and I were split up and no one was interested. Will fly Wizz or BA next time.

### Blue Air customer review
I flew from London Luton to Bucharest and back and I had one of the most awful experiences. It was impossible to receive an itinerary per email. Secondly the cabin was extremely hot until the plane was in the air. Even the stewards were using the magazines as a fan. Most important on the flight back we were allowed at check in to take our hand luggage onboard but at the gate they weighed it and didn't allow us to get on the flight until paying 50 euros for 3 kg overweight on one of the bags. We reduced it to 1.5kg and still didn't allow us. Instead of weighing it at check in before security they left it on purpose to do it at the gate. Moreover they said it's 50 euros but took 250 RON Selected seats that we paid for were already given to someone else as well and we had to get others. Luckily were quite early at the check in so we got only one row further but if we were late we would have received even worse seats. The crew had no clue where we will get our bags whether at the airplane steps or with the rest of the luggage. Hugely disappointing experience and I would never recommend them.

### Blue Air customer review
DUB-BCM return in June 2012. Flying with Blue Air produced very different experiences going out and coming back. At Dublin they were very inefficient. They had one staff member on check-in for a full 737 so it took ages. When I eventually reached the check-in desk the staff member told me the flight was delayed by half an hour. Fair enough I said and I texted my girlfriend in Romania who was to pick me up from the airport in Bacau. It didn't stop there however. When the staff eventually arrived at the boarding gate half an hour late they informed us that the gate had changed causing yet another delay. When we finally got on the plane it literally sat there for another half an hour and we left Dublin a total of one hour and forty minutes late. Now this would be slightly understandable at a peak time like three in the afternoon. However this was at one in the morning. There were no other flights to cause congestion! The flight itself was fine and smooth but there were so many screaming children that getting any sleep was impossible. Legroom was better than Ryanair but that isn't saying much. Coming back was much better in relation to time. We left Bacau on time and even arrived in Dublin ten minutes early so I was happy about that. Screaming children was a problem again (another night flight) but it was cheap so I guess I can't be too upset. As for food and beverages there were none for free just a ridiculously overpriced menu. Unless it proves unavoidable I probably won't fly Blue Air in the future.

### Blue Air customer review
LTN-BBU-LTN. Both flights on old Boeing 737-400. Dirty cabin old tired and dirty blue leather seats air conditioning system did not work and some tray tables were broken. Good seating assignment system that works well and cabin crew on both flights friendly and attentive. We will definitely be flying Wizz Air until Blue Air has replaced their fleet of ageing aircraft.

### Blue Air customer review
Bacau-Brussels return. Pleasant flight although shortly delayed apologies given by Cabin crew after boarding. Cabin crew were nice and helpful and seemed interested in our comfort. Plane was rather old but ok. Bacau Airport is very small with only 2 check-in desks. Ticket price was more than fair.

### Blue Air customer review
Luton to Bucharest return. On the outbound flight we had a very cramped seat and one of the air stewardesses was quite rude. On the return flight the check-in attendant at Baneasa airport was again very unfriendly. Leg room on the return was much more spacious at the front of the plane. Both flights were on time so no problems there.

### Blue Air customer review
Dublin to Bacau return. I had a bit of trouble trying to book tickets using their web-site but the representatives in Dublin office sorted it for me over the phone. The flight attendants were extremely pleasant on both flights toilets clean and stocked. Seats spacious for a budget airline but ask for window or aisle not the middle seat. I would choose Blue Air rather than Ryanair.

### Blue Air customer review
My first experience of Blue Air was positive: cheap ticket and reliable service nothing fancy absolutely low cost. The second time I booked Stuttgart–Sibiu the flight was cancelled. I was ensured on the phone I could get a refund. However in spite of numerous phone calls and emails and promises made by customer service in Germany and in Romania the fare was never refunded. I will not fly Blue Air again.

### Blue Air customer review
An interesting experience. The website booking was fine though it changed suddenly into Romanian halfway through the booking process with no ability to change back to English. The aircraft on Luton to Baneasa routes are not always Blue Air aircraft and planes themselves are ancient. Flights were on time Baneasa airport is a wonderful relic. It works but only just. Any more flights per day and it would be overloaded. While we were away the airline seemed to get sued by someone and local TV suggested that flights might stop. We were pleased to get to the airport to find this was not the case. Planes were comfortable although I'm sure the cabin crew were smoking behind the curtain at the back on one flight.

### Blue Air customer review
Bucharest Baneasa - London Luton. Delays delays and more delays with terrible customer service. Flight time changed the day before from 1545 to 1835. Half the people on the flight including myself were unaware of the change so were at the airport way too early. I asked at the Blue Air desk why the flight was delayed and I was told "Blue Air don't have enough planes". Baneasa airport is worse than a bus terminal nowhere to sit poor air conditioning (in 35C temperatures) and uninterested staff. 1835 came and went but we did eventually board a plane at 1910. The excitement was short lived as we were asked to get off the plane and were bussed back to the cramped terminal. There was no information given out by the Blue Air staff and for long periods they disappeared to avoid angry passengers. People were having to phone the airline to get any information. After being strung along for a while with false promises we were told we would be taking off at 2240. They initially did not want to give out refreshments even when reminded of the EU regulations but after much arguing eventually did. Never again!

### Blue Air customer review
We were stranded in Bucharest after the Sky Europe Collapse so we had no choice but to fly with Blue Air to Brussels. Baneasa airport is terrible has to be one of the worst in the world badly organized Staff unfriendly rude and unhelpful throughout. Only 2 checkin counters for about 5 flights leaving around the same time terminal is tiny and was fully packed. To make matters even worse they have a stupid policy where if you have baggage to checkin you need to pay a fee of I think 20 euro per piece but they cannot take the money at the checkin desk you need to shuffle through the fully packed terminal and then go and line up at another desk with even more people and pay for it separately then return to the checkin desk so they can check you have paid. The whole process took around 2 hours and we never moved more than a few metres the whole time. When we were finally bussed to the plane the staff were rude and someone I was travelling with has a fear of flying so they wanted us to be seated together but they would not allow it even though there was a spare seat at the back which I then moved to after the flight took off. One cabin crew member yelled very loudly at me because apparently my bag was too heavy but no one mentioned it in the terminal. Staff at the airport spoke little English. The plane was old and we really questioned the safety of it. Complimentary water served but then cabin crew at the back of the plane for the rest of the flight they even were not present to prepare the cabin for landing. On landing there were many people (Romanians) on mobile phones making phone calls etc none of the staff said anything. Mentioned it to staff after landing and they said they did not see it happen. I hope never to fly with them again and I urge anyone to have a think before choosing blue air or a flight that leaves from Baneasa but the whole thing is an experience in itself.

### Blue Air customer review
Luton to Sibiu. The flights were early staff friendly and spoke ok English. The aircraft on this route is an old B737-300 with rather uncomfortable seats. Excellent fares when booked in advance.
