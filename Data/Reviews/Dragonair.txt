### "I would not fly Dragonair again"
Not Verified |  My experience with DragonAir is mixed. Our flight from Kempegowda International Airport, Bangalore (BLR) to Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) was pleasantly good. The one from Hong Kong to Bangalore was very dysfunctional! Our flight was continuously postponed. 9pm to 12.10am to 2.30am to 3.40am and later to 4.20am (reason still unknown.) Later we were given coupons to eat from the airport food court (this was given after some air-geek rebuked them to follow the rules of flight delay and all that) What I heard later on was that! It was a trick played by DragonAir to cancel the flight for 24 hours and make some savings and amendments. Frustrated American held a revolt and the DragonAir flying to Chennai was cancelled and we finally reached Bangalore Airport at around 7-8 in the morning. The food sucks by the way! We have no vegan or vegetarian option. Everything has egg or fish oil in it. The airhostesses were rude and would rebuke in Chinese. It was so confusing! I would not fly Dragonair again!

### "Value for money is horrible"
Flight itself was very smooth and take off and landing were good. Air hostesses were horrible. Very rude, inconsiderate, unprofessional and incomprehensible. Value for money is horrible because the inflight meal seems like they've slapped some leftovers together. A passenger next to me who had ordered the vegetarian meal, was given a single puri (Indian bread) without any condiments or vegetable side - a pathetic excuse for a meal. The non veg meal was hardly tolerable as well. On a flight with mostly elderly citizens, the hospitality was certainly not good.

### "disappointed with in-flight meal"
Kota Kinabalu to Hong Kong. It was a pleasant experience flying on the second day of Chinese New Year. Flight KA060 was delayed until 1500 from the original schedule departure 1200. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I was not able to make my flight connection to Beijing. I was delighted that a notify sms was sent to my mobile informing of such delay. Another notification was sent from BKI based ground staff to further confirm such. I arrived the airport earlier with the hope that I will be able to get a replacement flight to Beijing. Seemingly that it was indeed risky for me to get a connecting flight from HKG to PEK on 1830. They offered me the option of next day departure which I agreed upon. Travelling was made easier as a confirmed seat and boarding pass for CX390 was also issued at the same time. Similarly, hotel was also arranged for me. Upon boarding flight KA060, I was assisted by the cabin crew to my seat. A apology was also made prior to departure informing the reason behind such delay. I am impressed with the professionalism of the flight attendants. In flight meal was promptly served after airborne. I had been flying Cathay Dragon since 2014. Nonetheless, I am slightly disappointed with the in-flight meal. The portion has now been re-sized to smaller portion since 2016. In the last 12 months I had also flown with other airline in this region. Asiana Airlines still serve dessert and metal cutlery which Cathay Dragon now longer provide.

### "meal choice is better"
I commute quite frequently from Hong Kong to Beijing, either on the 5pm Cathay Pacific or the 6pm Cathay Dragon, and it is Dragon that offers better service in general from my experience. The meal is better, though again cabin staff no longer bother to greet members. What is better is the meal choice from Hong Kong restaurant dishes, but what is downgrading is the offer of a piece of cheap 'Hong Kong street cafe cookie' promoted by a local actor unknown to international passengers (wonder if this is advertising). The cookie is not tasteful and its distribution is below the dignity of business class (and I note that on this flight they even have First class). But my dislike of the cookie does not deter me from flying this flight again.

### "unfortunately really disappointing"
Hong Kong to Da Nang. First day as Cathay Dragon but unfortunately really disappointing. No inflight entertainment, no drinks run of any kind; chose the chicken with noodles but the chicken must have been on holiday. Staff were ok and cabin clean but it all looked rather tired. Have had much better experiences on no-frills airlines for less money.

### "cabin crew are very nice"
Dragonair is part of Cathay Pacific. From Hong Kong to Guangzhou is less than 100 miles, but they provide an excellent service . When on board, cabin crew deliver a bottle of water and a cookie. The cabin crew are very nice.

### "seats are comfortable"
Kolkata to Hong Kong. The look of the cabin is like a budget airline cabin with no entertainment, charging plug or Coat hook. However, they do provide blanket and pillow. Seats are comfortable with enough leg room. The food was served in a box, and contained a sandwich, a small bowl of fruit, packet of two cookies and small bar of chocolate. Though the flight starts at 01.15 AM but the quantity of the food served is very less and is not as per Cathay standard. Toilets were clean and fresh. Beverage cart service is not available in the flight but if you ask for any beverages they will give you what you want, subject to availability. Similarly while returning from Hong Kong, they served me whiskey on demand. Crew was very courteous. The flight would have been Cathay standard flight if they had added entertainment in their flight like other Cathay / Dragonair flights and improved the food. After all, we are paying more compared to the budget airlines for the services.

### "unexpectedly unpleasant flight"
Kolkata to Hong Kong with Dragonair. An unexpectedly unpleasant flight. Although the aircraft was newish and an iPad laden with a limited selection of entertainment provided, the service was not up to par. The flight attendant, instead of providing me the menu card, read out the options from the copy she held in her hand. There was a couple with an infant who wailed through much of the night flight. In a cabin with just 2 rows and 8 seats, there is no escaping this misery. Very little sleep possible. Furthermore, before landing I was unable to use the lavatory - 2 flight attendants were on their knees cleaning the floor both inside and outside the lavatory it was splashed with water, and covered with absorbent towels. What a mess! Was glad to rush out of the plane when it landed.

### "dependable, satisfactory service"
Connected to this flight to Kolkata in Hong Kong. A shuttle bus carried us to another terminal to board the plane through jetways. Plane departed and arrived on time. Inflight was cheerful and efficient, iPads were provided. It carried a much reduced version of the entertainment provided on Cathay Pacific's US-HKG route. Port wine was served after dessert - a small tub of Haagen Daz - frozen as a stone - on request. Newspapers were all in Chinese - I don't read the language and no amenities bag was provided. Also, the inflight shopping selection was extremely limited. Of the five items I picked from the catalog, only one was available. Lesson learned - don't rely on duty free shopping in the air for buying your gifts. Cathay Dragon is the only operator on this route and having flown over 20 times, it provides a dependable, satisfactory service.

### "it was enjoyable flight"
Hong Kong to Beijing with Cathay Dragon. My seat was at the middle of the aircraft. One meal was served and the total flight time was about 3 hours. The meal service was good. The crew were friendly and nice. Nevertheless, the in-flight entertainment system was not quite updated and the legroom of the economy class seat was not quite enough. The area of the restrooms could also be improved. In total, it was enjoyable flight.

### "saw other flight attendants helping"
Flew Dragonair from Hong Kong to Busan. Before landing in Busan, cabin crews started their checks, making sure if all the window blinds were open and all seats were in an upright position. At that time, I asked one of the male cabin crew to help me clear the meal box away, he shouted at me and instructed me to put the meal box into the seat pocket. Many passenger were looking at me which was embarrassing. I saw other flight attendants helping passengers clear their rubbish and the meal box.

### "service was friendly and efficient"
Hong Kong to Chiang Mai with Dragonair. Best flight imaginable. Service was friendly and efficient. Special meals were honored, and my low-lactose meal even had a piece of well-prepared fish. Amazing. The seats were fine too. If every airline offered the service provided by Dragonair on this flight, there would be a lot fewer air travel complaints. We loved this flight.

### "service was good"
Flew Hong Kong to Beijing. Good flight, while the two previous flights were cancelled due to the notorious 'traffic control' in Beijing. My flight departed on time and had a rare on the spot arrival. Service was good and the meal is good. Dragonair is part of Cathay Pacific but remain a separate operating entity, and in my opinion they are better than Cathay, and I always prefer them on this route. Business seat is of older configuration but does not matter for a short haul flight.

### "kept giving poor excuses"
I will never fly Dragonair again. Our orginal flight from Shanghai to Hong Kong was delayed for over 7 hrs along with all other Hong Kong flights for Dragonair. Dragonair kept giving poor excuses like weather, air traffic control, aircraft scheduleing etc. After much fighting they finally offered a meal voucher. When asked about my connection flight that had been missed they advised me that Hong Kong would have all the details when I land. Guess what when I landed they had nothing. Landed just after 1am and had to fight to get a hotel voucher for a hotel 45 mins away. Got told that Dragonair would cover the cost of a transfers, breakfast, IDD call. Get back to airport at 9.30am for my new connecting flight to only fight again for reimbursement of taxis and meal voucher.

### "almost like a no-frills airline"
Kolkata to Hong Kong with Dragonair. The flight was almost like a no-frills airline. Did not expect this from Cathay Pacific. No personal screens on seats, no drinks options, just a snack box. The seats were OK though. Lot of turbulence, especially just before landing at Hong Kong a big bump! No seat chargers. Cathay Pacific needs to improve its Dragonair flight services on international routes.

### "Dragonair preferred to Cathay"
Beijng to Hong Kong with Dragonair. Very smooth flight - on time, which is not easily expected for a flight from Beijing where there is always problems with traffic restrictions or weather. There is nothing to write home about for any economy flight as such but it is good that bottled water is provided at each seat (not provided by parent company Cathay Pacific) and hot items available at breakfast. Service is adequately good. It seems that Dragonair flights are preferred to Cathay and I hope now that the airline is renamed Cathay Dragon, the service standards will not change as I feel Dragonair is better - particularly for meals.

### "smiles from cabin crew"
Wonderful flight and fantastic cabin crew. We had just flown Cathay Pacific from Adelaide to Hong Kong and then on going to Beijing with Dragonair. Brilliant service, greeted with smiles from cabin crew. Very fast and caring about passenger safety, comfort and top quality service. Very good food such as beef or fish or duck and all food presented piping hot and tasty. Great value in a clean fresh and well looked after aircraft, well done Dragonair, we will fly again with you soon.

### "a satisfactory flight"
A good flight with Dragonair from Hong Kong to Tokyo, on time, and the arrival at Haneda is a good thing free from long queue and custom hussle usually experienced at Narita (will remember to choose Haneda flight if available). Good breakfast, hot items include rice dishes. Service is OK but no greeting to members (they skipped this god gesture). New flatbed seat but not very useful for shorthaul even it was an early morning flight. A satisfactory flight but nothing special.

### "crew members young and inexperienced"
Flew Hong Kong to Kota Kinabalu. Dragonair used to have good service: good food and beverages and good service from crew members. I used to look forward to travelling with Dragonair but not anymore. Wine was not served during meal times and the welcome juice service has now been strangely abolished. Upon cruising altitude, meals were served immediately. Considering that the flight was not full and it is a 2.5 hour flight, welcome juice service could have been factored in. Crew members were young and highly inexperienced: impersonal and not friendly. They were there to perform a perfunctory duty and were rather robotic at times.

### "would recommend Dragonair"
Hong Kong to Shanghai. Flight was initially delayed from 1200 to 1340 but then we boarded around 1325 and sat on the aircraft not getting airborne until 1600. This was due to "bad weather" in Shanghai although probably more likely the usual chinese air force airspace delays along this route which I am given to understand are almost constant. I accept this is no fault of the airline. However it might have been better to let us sit in the terminal rather than on the aircraft for so long. They gave us our meals on the ground, these were good. The flight was good, friendly staff dealing with loud and frustrated passengers well and spoke good english. The seat was comfortable. Check in and ground staff were friendly and the aircraft was clean. Return flight to Hong Kong was cancelled. This again due to "bad weather"/chinese airspace. Problems with every airline so not Dragonair fault. However two queues to ticket desk (both massive) when we arrived, were for different things. No one told us which queue to stand in so we split up and stood one in each, eventually got a standby number, came back 2 hours later and was put on a new flight. This flight left very soon so were given priority security and baggage tags. Missed our connection in HKG but staff helped us get accommodation and a new flight in HKG. Staff at Shanghai were slow, didn't tell us which queue to be in or what was going on. However check in clerk was helpful. Again not Dragonair fault but could've been handled much better. 4 hours of queuing and then a sprint to security not fun. Flight itself was on A330, clean and had ife. Meals were good, so were crew, seats slightly dated but fine and aircraft clean. Would recommend Dragonair, they are a good airline and delays not their fault, just staff in Shanghai need more training at how to deal with this especially as it happens frequently. They are excellent though when it comes to reorganising in Hong Kong and as sister airline to Cathay Pacific make connections to them as seamless and worry free as possible. As you can make it all (international flight and domestic flight connecting) under one booking they will sort hotels and new flights if you miss connection so would recommend Dragonair especially if you are doing international flight followed by domestic flights within China.

### "found Dragonair better than Cathay"
Hong Kong to Beijing with Dragonair. This was a redemption flight and it was good in that it is right on time, for flights to Beijing and Shanghai you can almost expect delays. The first time I board a plane that is painted with the new logo, Cathay Dragon, the service was not bad for the 3 hour flight. In fact I found Dragonair better than Cathay on this route which I fly much, and the Purser did come to greet me as a Sapphire member: they rarely do so this days especially with Cathay.

### "won't fly Dragonair again"
Hanoi to Hong Kong with Dragonair. The flight eventually departed 3 hours late, meaning we missed our connection to Sydney. Arrival time was around 0110, and the transfer desk in Hong Kong was a complete shambles, and we finally got our hotel voucher more than an hour later, for a hotel 30 minutes away. The queue for immigration was horrendous and we could see we would be very unlikely to get to the hotel before 3am. Since our rearranged flight was due to leave at 0910, we decided to stay in the Plaza Premium lounge, airside. All this could have been avoided if Dragonair had been proactive in arranging accommodation in advance of our late arrival in Hong Kong. They had enough time. The aircraft, flight and meal were reasonable, though cabin service commenced very late in the flight. I read that Dragonair has one of the worst reputations for time keeping. This may not be entirely it's fault, however lack of organisation was very apparent, making this one of my worst flying experience in over 50 years. Won't fly Dragonair again.

### "crew were very attentive"
Dragonair flight KA 854 from Hong Kong to Wuhan was slightly delayed. A refurbished A320-200 registration B-HSP aircraft with new smart bin and seat. An apology was made by the Captain once on board. It was a full flight. The crew were very attentive and helpful. Inflight meals were served and we were given a choice of chicken or fish. As for beverages, only coffee, tea and mineral water were available. I would suggest that a variety of juices are served too. A big thank you to the crew for their professionalism.

### "remains good today"
Flew from Hong Kong to Shanghai, the first time I have flown with Dragonair in over 13 years. It was a good airline then and it remains good today. The outbound portion of the flight was delayed by over an hour, which was beyond the control of the airline. Service and the inflight meal were good. The IFE on board didn't have the latest equipment, but still had a good selection that was more than enough for a two-hour, 20-minute flight (which had to be expedited because of the delay). The return portion was delayed by half an hour, which is practically on time for Shanghai standards. This flight was no more than half-full and I got two seats all to myself. Again, service and amenities were good.

### "staff efficient and friendly"
Easy check in at the airport with Dragonair for flight from Hong Kong to Phuket, staff efficient and friendly. Aircraft was on stand well before boarding time but boarding was delayed for unexplained reason and subsequently plane pushed back over 30 minutes late. We were then in a queue of several aircraft waiting to depart and we took off almost one hour late. Cabin service was good, considering the short flight time, and the meal on offer was acceptable. Seat was shell type recliner which had little or no lumbar support but OK for short flight. Although bags had priority stickers attached they still took a long time to arrive on the carousel. Would use Dragonair again despite the minor problems.

### "seats were always upgraded"
Clark, Philippines to Hong Kong. Dragonair website is identical to Cathay Pacific and is user friendly. Booking is a breeze. Their online check-in and bag-drop counter at the airport are convenient. Inflight entertainment (Studio KA) is great with huge collections. I believe they just offer an all economy seats for their CRK-HKG flights however since there are business seats allotted due to the aircraft configuration, they allow other passengers to be seated in business cabin. I'm happy that my seats were always upgraded! Snack is so-so. Just a small pack of cookies, chocolate bar and water for short haul flights. One thing, the cabin crews should use English as a means of communication to customers.

### "we had a good experience"
We booked this Dragonair ticket through S7 airlines from Irkutsk, and flew from Beijing to Hong Kong. Cabin crew were friendly and the food was of a good standard. Nothing too special on this flight - good entertainment on the PTV after many flights on S7 without any. The seat was of good width, however the legroom was a bit cramped and the seat a bit short - ie. it goes up to my shoulders (however the head rest could be adjusted up and down). Overall we had a good experience. I recommend this airline and will fly Dragonair again.

### "taking care of my father"
Due to the unexpected heavy storm, Jeju airport was closed and the flight my father was supposed to transfer via Hong Kong was rescheduled to a day later. He only had a hand luggage (checked-in luggage from Singapore couldn't be retreived) and Hong Kong was experiencing the cold wave as well. As he had just recovered from a surgery done 3 weeks ago, we were quite worried about his health. Via text messages, we asked him to approach the counter at the airport for assistance. A while later, he told us he was travelling to a hotel to stay for a night and all expenses were covered by the airline! Dragonair had provided a night's stay at aRoyal Garden hotel inclusive of meals. They also reimbursed the taxi he took from the airport to the hotel. The stranded passengers were given preprinted chits to be presented at the hotel so check-in was smooth. During the whole duration, my father was being updated about the flight status via text messages. The next day, the hotel arranged transportation for the passengers to return to the airport. In all, the staff and service was excellent and I must say that the airline is well-prepared to handle situations like this. Thank you Dragonair, for taking care of my father and the stranded passengers!

### "an outstanding crew"
Shanghai to Jakarta via Hong Kong with Dragonair, and an outstanding crew. They have 2 choices of food, but when they came to me its only 1 choice left and I didnt like it, so they offers me breads, salad and a choice of noodles. They handle their client very well and I love it. The minus is some aircraft still don't have inflight entertainment.

### "most friendly manner"
Siem Reap to Hong Kong on Dragonair was fantastic. Although this is a single-class aircraft we were treated like business class. A warm meal was served timely and in a most friendly manner. I must say this is airline will be high on my list when travelling in the region again.

### "clear information on everything"
Travelled Dragonair from Hanoi-HKG and back 20th and 31st December 2015, respectively. Airbus 321. Extremely alert staff, caring, pro-active, energetic, and professional. Food and wines of unexpected high quality and tasteful for economy class. 4 different kinds of beers offered – all from different countries. Elite card holder recognition by FA staff - even from other OW-airlines than Cathay and Dragonair. Only a minor delay of 30 minutes prevents me from rating the airline to 10 of 10 as delays are common according to their own information provided on their website, which is very good. Clear information on everything and willingness to expose their weak point, delays, is appreciated. Return flight was full on New Years’ eve, but well managed. A minor fault occurred by FAs mistakenly providing someone else “my” child meal. However, it was elegantly made up for by staff apologizing and personally displaying three alternatives for us by presenting them all on a tray, opening the foil. Drink rounds frequent and gentle.

### "crew friendly and courteous"
Hong Kong to Hiroshima return with Dragonair, both flights on an A320-200. The first flight had no in-flight entertainment system on board, not even a shared screen in the cabin. The cabin was old and tired, and some seats were not well-maintained. Food was fairly acceptable but was nothing compared to Cathay Pacific. Fortunately the cabin crew were friendly and courteous, making this flight a fairly enjoyable one. The return flight was an older A320-200, but with renovated cabin. The cabin was smarter and more comfortable. Flight meal was better than the first flight. Interestingly, we could use the aircraft wifi on our tablets to access the in-flight entertainment system. Unfortunately, there was no guidance on how to download the Studio KA app when connected to the aircraft wifi and it turned out to be a 4.5-hour flight with no in-flight entertainment again. Cabin crew again mostly friendly and helpful. I was happy with my experience with Dragonair but I do not look forward to flying small aircraft (eg. A320). I would prefer the A330-300 in the future.

### "excellent cabin service"
Hong Kong to Shanghai with Dragonair and a fantastic experience. I would say it's much better than its parent company Cathay Pacific. Cabin attendants were present throughout the cabin, with warm and friendly smile. Flight delayed for a bit which I think it's normal due to the heavily congested Chinese airspace. A varieties of beverages and 2 choices of hot meal were handed out. Ice-cream afterwards! The meal in economy class is one of the best I've had! A superb airline with excellent cabin service.

### "flight is always delayed"
Flew Dragonair from Guangzhou connecting to a Cathy Pacific flight back to London. The CAN-HKG flight was scheduled for 22.20, with my flight to LHR scheduled for 00.35. There was a single announcement at 22.00 that the flight was delayed, no other information. The aircraft arrived at 22.10, it took forever to do the turnaround - we departed the gate at 23.20. How can it take over an hour for a turnaround - the ground staff gave the impression that this was the first time they had handled a Dragonair flight. The flight itself was okay, but little apologies for the delay. Upfront was comfortable with a nice lunchbox given out before departure. The flight was 90% full of people with tight connections in HKG. We arrived at HKG at 00:15. We parked up at a remote stand and wasted so much time with a bus transfer back to the terminal. Arriving into the terminal there was ground staff everywhere holding up signs for connecting destinations. They already had new boarding passes for a flight 9 hours later to LHR. This is where is all falls apart. We had to clear HKG immigration and were told to proceed to a hotel shuttle bus in the coach park. Basically it took 90 minutes for the hotel shuttle to arrive, there was no Dragonair staff to be found in the airport for assistance. Apparently this flight is always delayed.

### "cabin crew always present"
Wonderful service and I was happy with economy class experience. Comfy seat, nice cabin, and IFE is great! Food was great, and prompt service. Cabin crew always present to help. I felt a little unsafe with Chinese carriers so tried Dragonair because of many reviews. I wasn't disappointed! I felt safe and comfortable the entire trip. Had a rough landing in Wuhan but that seems like the normal thing here.

### Dragonair customer review
Efficient boarding, on time departure and arrival. Efficient and friendly service. No IFE for the relatively short flight. Refreshments fine.

### Dragonair customer review
1hr connection in Hong Kong for flight to Da Nang missed due to late departure - congestion in China airspace. Dragonair shouldn't really allow ticketing of this tight a connection. Regardless, flight was as expected for Dragonair - comfortable, friendly and efficient FA's. IFE was a bonus for a short hop. Meal was fine. However, what excelled was the handling by the FA and ground crew of what proved to be a missed connection. FA informed us they had received a message from HKG ground staff we would not make connection. Very disappointing as a delay in our holiday and resulted in a night at HKG Regal airport hotel. On arriving at Hong Kong for, we were met by ground staff who, within 20 mins had us booked in two rooms at the Regal, issued vouchers for dinner and breakfast and booked on flights the next day. Sure we were not happy about the delay to our holiday, but the level of service from the Dragonair ground staff was excellent.

### Dragonair customer review
Convenient online check in. Friendly ground staff and boarded the plane within 5 min from the boarding time. However, only a small portion of rice with chicken and a small glass of orange juice were served. The flight attendents were robotic and were not seen except when serving meals.

### Dragonair customer review
Left Hong Kong 1hr and 20 min late but received text notification. Made up 45 minutes of this en route to Beijing. Economy cabin full yet felt spacious, clean and new. Service was excellent and the meal closest to the best I've had in economy for some time, in fact this was better then parent company Cathay Pacific can offer in Premium Economy.

### Dragonair customer review
I booked Sydney to HK with Qantas then connecting Dragonair from HK to Beijing. My flight scheduled at 7pm for departure. When I landed at HKG, I was told the flight is late because late arrival of inbound aircraft. At 8pm, I was told the flight will be further delay to 9.30pm, and finally the flight took off at midnight. From beginning to the end, Dragonair did not want to take any responsibility. Service on board is pretty average, staff serviced a meal and never see them again. Hardly anyone cleaned the toilet I could see during the flight.

### Dragonair customer review
Return of the outward flight two weeks ago, and just as bad, very late arrival, poor beverage. It seems that this airline cannot fly on time. I checked everyday whether this plane has flown in the last two weeks and it has only been on time once! It was cheap so I guess I should expect it. They also seem to find it difficult to accredit one world miles.

### Dragonair customer review
This flight was one of the worst flights I have been on. An hour and 50 min flight was already really unbearable for me. Economy on this plane has absolutely no legroom (I'm 5"9) and seats were terribly designed. The cabin crew were rude and were not friendly. The food was, as usual for Cathay Pacific and Dragonair flights, had tiny portions and were awful, in fact this time it was even cold and soggy. I was on a school trip so I had no choice for an airline, however we did get our own check in counter which was good. Nevertheless, the AVOD IFE system was really good and there were a wide range of movies and TV series to choose from.

### Dragonair customer review
This was a connecting flight to QR931, unfortunately it was 40 minutes late leaving. The boarding was total chaos, you cannot have a snake of passengers 400 metres long awaiting a bus that takes 40 minutes to load, when you start only 30 minutes before departure. If it had not been for ground staff at Clark and Qatar Airways staff we would have missed connection.

### Dragonair customer review
Check in is effective and quite fast. Crew onboard is also very effective. The biggest problem with Dragonair is the flight is delayed hence we got very late to Hong Kong. However Dragonair organized a pick up service at the gate and bring you directly to the gate for the next flight on time, but in most of the cases, the luggage will not come with you on time and may be delivered 1 day later at the final destination.

### Dragonair customer review
KA 380 from HKG to FUK on 16/5. Flight delayed for 2.5 hours but well handled with a HK$75 food voucher given to every passenger. The aircraft was a 20-year-old A330-300 with unexpectedly new cabin and a wide selection of inflight entertainment. Flight attendants were attentive and helpful throughout the entire journey. Inflight meal a cream sauce chicken pasta was hardly edible but glad to receive ice cream after the meal. Much to commend with the reservation concerning the catering service as stated above. KA 381 from FUK to HKG on 20/5. Flight departed on time. The aircraft was another old A330-300 with old layout - seat was not comfortable and the IFE system was not efficient although again a wide choice of programmes. Cabin was too warm and uncomfortable with turbulence affecting during the entire flight. Inflight meal fish pasta was much better on this leg. Had to hold over HKG due to heavy showers and thunderstorm but was fortunate enough to arrive with a half-hour delay only.

### Dragonair customer review
HKIA to Chiang Mai in Thailand in tourist class. Service was excellent staff spoke excellent English and mandarin Chinese. Though the flight was short food was delicious both ways much better that transatlantic flights to South America in Iberia business class. I sat in the front rows seats were quite spacious and leg room was abundant being 1.88 tall I could appreciate the difference with other airlines. I will definitely fly again Dragonair for short medium flights in south east Asia. Ticket was not cheap compared to European flights or Air Asia. But it was not expensive either if compared to similar length flights in the region.

### Dragonair customer review
PVG-HKG return (connect to/from CX long-haul flight) with A330-300 clean and well maintained. Both ways delayed more than 1hr and bussed to/from main terminal caused huge inconvenience as I had connect flight to/from CX long- haul nowadays KA still provide meal service but the portion is very tiny even Chinese domestic airlines has better quality food. AVOD on A330-300 is very good.

### Dragonair customer review
This is the best airline I have had the pleasure of traveling with! We were stuck in Kathmandu due to the earthquake. They were one of the few flights out! They handled the change efficiently and with personal care. The attendants were courteous friendly and appeared to care about our welfare. Our arrival in Hong Kong was excellent they had everything organized by flights gave us hotel accommodations transportation to and from Hong Kong City and personally walked us over to pick up our luggage. We did not have to worry about a thing!

### Dragonair customer review
SYX-HKG. Flight was delayed 1 hour for a 70 min flight. Scheduled to land in HK 2300 hrs made it to the HK airport express at 0040 to catch the last train to the city (without check-in luggage). For the people who checked in their bags it must have been a nightmare. KA's flights have constant delays. Of five trips with them over the past year only one was actually on-time. The notiFLY update is slow and not reliable but this one went even without notiFLY warning. Aircraft is outdated. Cabin air-conditioning was out of service while parked on the ground both waiting for take-off and for the shuttle bus upon arrival at a remote parking area (15 min drive to the passenger apron). All in all a very bad flight. Don't think I'll fly KA again.

### Dragonair customer review
KA621 APR 11. Nice service and prompt cabin service. But no movies are available on the flight-entertainment system even the flight takes more than 2 hours.

### Dragonair customer review
HAN-HKG KA 294 in Business. The departure was 30 mins delayed. The pick up in Hong Kong was excellent they brought me to the gate for the next flight to Germany. They informed me that my window seat was out of order (10 A) and put me to the end of the cabin (17C). After landing I found out that they just want to optimize the seat and just stuck us in another seat. Food was good service was poor I ordered some drinks and they just ignored it. There was no movie in the entertainment channel only TV and some documents.

Many thanks for the warm service of the KA876 crew last Friday. That morning I flew from Hong Kong to Shanghai for two days of meetings after a busy week. I felt extremely stressed and was very worried about any possible flight delay due to aviation control in Shanghai. But the assuring smiles from the friendly staff at the cabin entrance made me feel very relaxed. I had a good rest on board. It was a wonderful flying experience.

HKG-PEK in Business. Two hour delay at HKG passengers have been told because late arrival of the aircraft. But KA is based in HKG surely KA could re-organise the aircraft better. Business lounge "the Pier' close to gate 64 is pretty average Qantas business class is so much better. Boarding process was pretty average staff made announcement of boarding but did not board anyone until 15 minutes later. Inflight service was pretty bad for business class. Crew did not clean away the pre-departure water glass and wet towel until dinner was served. The cabin lights turned off before dinner items were cleaned. It was bad service for a business class for any airline. On a positive note KA finally has personal entertaining system in business class the seat is also better than the old one.

I was coming home with my wife from Shanghai on Sunday 11 January 2015. The original flight KA 897 I checked-in on-line was due to depart at 1920hrs. We arrived Pudong airport in a rush at 1830hrs only to find out the flight was cancelled! I was so tired and really did not want to be put onto another late flight. With only 25 minutes to departure we were checked in an earlier flight KA835 departing at 1855hrs. We were given helpful advice and direction to speed up the immigration process and managed to board the flight 5 minutes before departure. Although the last ones to board before gate closed we were greeted nicely. A happy flight with lots of smiles and drinks that took me home in time for a good sleep. Arrived in Hong Kong and turned on the iPhone only to have another positive surprise. I found out that there had been missing calls and messages earlier during the day advising us in advance that the flight was cancelled and already booking made for us to take the earlier flight.

Upgraded to business class for the flight from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Bulkhead seat at the front so masses of legroom. Seats very comfortable. It seems almost unfair to offer any negative comments on the flight but I picked the wrong entree! I chose halibut but it didn't come with the sauce the menu said I'm still not sure what it was! My partner chose a pork dish which was extremely tasty. Drinks offered before take off before meal and wine served with the meal. Good entertainment selection. Very pleasant experience. Attentive and professional flight attendants.

KA169 10 Jan. Did a Kolkata - Hong Kong midnight departure flight. Service was superb. Asked for a few glasses of Champaign making myself to sleep well after the meal service. Attentive and friendly crew. Ipad was given out to passengers on this A320 new aircraft played with it for a bit then slept for the remaining 3 hours of the journey.

### Dragonair customer review
Flew HKG-CNX on DA232 on 16th January boarding via a bus-gate flight was busy but not full. Crew were friendly and professional and after the expected juice/biscuits box was served I was impressed when they offered hot dim- sum or egg/bacon 10 minutes later.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG to Danang. Great crew both ways. Boarding and disembarking not great though on return to HK lots of messing about getting buses etc but got dropped off right at immigration. Seats fine no entertainment at all as old style plane. Very hard working crew food fine actually better than CX. Coffee tea on request and fast always with a smile. Dragonair crew do work very hard and even with some tricky customers ( over demanding macro polo holders mainlanders) they do really well a larger plane would do well at this growing destination!

### Dragonair customer review
Excellent service offered by Dragonair Flight 482 to Taipei Taoyuan Airport from HKG. The economy cabin was as comfortable as CX Long Haul. With the exception of movies the TV content was outstanding. I think the food was better than any other regional airline it's just like flying on Cathay Pacific Long Haul! I definitely recommend Dragonair for any other future travellers!

### Dragonair customer review
KA872 HKG-PVG. Bus to the plane the seat is the old version. Legroom is very tight. There were no entertainment system onboard not even a public TV. Food and beverage quality impressed me. Although it is a short flight of 2 hours staff give you the menu before take off. There were two choices and different selection of beverages plus a Hagen-Dazs ice cream.

### Dragonair customer review
Xian to Hong Kong on KA947. Unable to do the online check in. The check in was smooth. The plane arrived in Xian a little bit late but manage to board and left on time. They ran out choice of meal when the cart arrived in our area. Arrived in Hong Kong a little bit late but had to wait on tarmac since the plane was parked on remote gate and ground crew did not arrive. We had to wait for 15-20 minutes before we were able to leave the plane and make our connection.

### Dragonair customer review
Hong Kong to Shanghai on KA874. Flight delayed approximately 30 min. However there was no announcement about the further delay. After waiting for 45 minutes we were told that the flight will be delayed to 2 hours from original schedule. Arrival in Shanghai was not good either the plane were parked at a remote stand. The original arrival in Shanghai was 3.20 PM. but we go there around 5.30 pm.

### Dragonair customer review
9th Nov 2014 Flight KA692 Penang (0800 dep) to Hong Kong. Minus points: 1) In-flight entertainment appears to lack a bit in terms of content but I am comparing this to Malaysia Airlines' long-haul operations. Being a regional airline this may be perfectly acceptable. 2) Food unspectacular. Plus points: 1) Friendly and attentive crew. 2) In-flight entertainment user interface is excellent - touch-screen responsive and with a single-hole jack to use your own earphones. General notes: My first flight with this airline and a very last-minute booking. I wasn't sure what to expect but was very pleasantly surprised which I probably shouldn't have been given that this airline is 100% Cathay Pacific-owned and has been operating since 1985. Quite enjoyable and good value. I would definitely fly with them again and would look forward to doing so.

### Dragonair customer review
PVG-HKG. As a subsidiary of Cathay Pacific you would expect the same high standards as the former and they did not fail. Superb service from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Requested a better seat due to my height which was not a problem and enjoyed the rest of the flight in relative comfort with great service from the cabin crew. The flight departure was delayed due to air congestion which is the norm for China these days but the captain made up for this enroute and kept us informed. As a regional airline they were great. Will definitely choose Dragon Air again.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-KHH-HKG (26 and 28 Sept). Outbound KA432 was delayed for 2+ hours and we were promptly notified. A Cathay Pacific plane flew us instead. Service was good by diligent and courteous staff. Meal was a wrap with curry chicken and a pack of Oolong tea. Major complaint was the delay as we were supposed to catch the 08.50 flight but were still in HKG at 11.00 am. Inbound KA455 departed KHH at 19.25 promptly. Nothing to complain about on this one class A320 which no inflight entertainment except the Silkroad Magazine in the seat pocket. Salute to KA as they serve a hot meal on this 1 hour flight. Pork Rice was offered with a Pineapple pie and a cup of OJ. We were not supposed to board this flight as our O class ticket was booked for the last flight of the evening which was on an A330 instead. We were allowed to catch the 19.20 flight. KA457 of the day was delayed 2.5 hours when it arrived HK at almost 1am the next day.

### Dragonair customer review
Chengdu to Hong Kong Sept 14 2014. Flight was cancelled when everyone was in the gate area due to mechanical issues. Everyone had to go back through immigration to rebook. The most disorganised mess I have ever experienced. Everyone was screaming at the staff. They didn't offer bookings on other airlines to Hong Kong but offered a flight to Macau and the option of taking a ferry. Many people missed their connecting flights in HK and staff in Chengdu seemed incapable of knowing what to do.

### Dragonair customer review
Chengdu to Hong Kong 22 Jun 2014: Was absolutely atrocious. I would have expected better standards from such a highly-rated airline. Chengdu airport is also partly to blame. No communication between airport staff and non- mandarin speaking passengers. They themselves did not even know what was happening with the flight. I waited at the airport for 11hours without any answers only to find out it was cancelled - 8.5 hours after it was due to depart! Hotel was booked and only managed 5 hours rest as they arranged a bus to take me to the airport at 6am the next day. Arriving at the airport found out they had rebooked me onto a Hong Kong Airlines flight (it was my first time flying with them and they were wonderful) but it was due to depart 30mins from the time I was made aware of my new flight! Mad dash through airport security and onto the plane. Overall a very disappointing experience with them. I will now consider only CX flights where possible otherwise a different airline altogether.

### Dragonair customer review
I was notified by DragonAir via SMS that my flight from Shanghai to Hong Kong (KA893) was cancelled while I was in a taxi on my way to Shanghai Pudong Airport at 5pm on 26 June 2014. When I arrived at the airport at around 5.30pm the DragonAir check-in counters were chaotic with hundreds queuing. The reason for the cancelled flight was - "Traffic Flow Control". Dragonair staff walked around and distributed coupons to get dinner in nearby restaurants. They asked us to come back at 7.00 to check the latest status. Came back at 7pm and waited for another 30 minutes and get the reply that I should come back at 8pm. I come back at 8pm but got the vague answer that all flights were cancelled. Staff asked travelers to come back at 9pm to check status. From 8.30pm the check-in area was absolutely chaotic. Because I needed to travel to Hong Kong urgently I booked another flight from Shanghai Pudong to Shenzhen. I was lucky that I booked onto China Eastern (MU5367).

### Dragonair customer review
Flew KHH-HKG-KHH a few weeks ago. The outbound leg was pretty good. Excellent food comfortable seats wonderful service with a smile. They manage to serve a full meal on the very short 1 hour flight which is excellent. On the downside our kids were not served their pre-ordered child meal just the regular adult meal. The deplaning in Hong Kong was via a bus ride. Must be a recent thing as a couple of years ago this flight did use a jetway although at a remote gate. Additionally the airline did not pass around immigration slips and we were turned around at the clearance queue to complete that step. This should be a standard process on any international flight. The return to KHH was messy. The flight was late and the equipment was changed to a Cathay jet. The famous CX/KA food was non-existent and instead we were served chicken wraps and a box of tea. Small detail but takes away from the normally wonderful CX/KA experience.

### Dragonair customer review
Chengdu - Hong Kong. The flight left on time and overall a great journey. Cabin staff very friendly and helpful with the breakfast nice and hot. Overall a good flight would use them again.

### Dragonair customer review
Dragonair really is an OK airline. I flew them for the umpteenth time to Kaohsiung and while the un-entertained seat was bearable (well it was pretty comfortable) the flight was really boring as the seatbelt sign stayed on. Service was good and breakfast was phenomenal (aside from crunchy siu mai). On the return I wonder if StudioKA trades off good food as the food we had was starchy (not too bad but not good). StudioKA is limited without actual movies. Overall pleasant but nothing worth raving about.

### Dragonair customer review
Hong Kong - Beijing vv on Airbus 320 as an extension of CX trip from Sydney. Being a sister airline of CX the standard was consistent with CX. On the trip to Beijing the cabin was so hot that passengers keep fanning themselves. Flight attendants spoke English Mandarin and Cantonese. Chose pork inedible. Other options all right. Quantity meagre in meals. Turbulent flights. Timing very unfriendly arrived in Beijing at 01.55 return trip left at 02.50 plane delayed until 03.30. No direct air bridge to aircraft bussed to and from aircraft.

### Dragonair customer review
Although I have flown with Dragonair from Dhaka to Hong Kong (return) numerous times before this was the first time that I have done so in Business Class. Overall I was impressed. The service was excellent the food good and the drink selection OK. My only complaint was the seats in that the only storage is in a small pocket in the centre armrest which is not really big enough. Also because the seats only recline to about a 15deg angle (i.e they are not lie flat) with no foot rest to support yourself when trying to sleep you are constantly sliding forward out of the seat really not very comfortable and the seat controls are also a bit difficult to work.

### Dragonair customer review
Just did another trip on Dragonair to Busan Korea. HKG-PUS departs at 02.30am with A320. Before the cabin was becoming all dark cabin crew handed out a box of snack including a bun chocolate and some fruits along with a bottle of water. Limited seat pitch on A320 very good 3 hour flight for sleeping. On the way back was departing at 8am Korea time. No PTV on the old A320 but nice yummy breakfast with Korean style Ginseng chicken with rice or scramble egg. Cabin crew were friendly and attentive as always. Hope their A320 will get new seats and PTV sometimes soon!

### Dragonair customer review
Hong Kong - Beijing (April 30 2013). Flight crew were very friendly and warm. Food is average but they give Hagen Dazs Ice Cream. Seat is comfortable. Horrible turbulence during take-off but the crew were professional and calm. Captain provided immediate advice and again very professional. Drinks are offered many times. Inflight entertainment is good (good selection of movies ranging from old to new) Will definitely fly them again.

### Dragonair customer review
Usual dodgy bus trip to the plane and chaotic boarding. Good seats. Fight full of noisy passengers it is CNY after all. Crew had had time keeping them in seats. Meal ok avoid usual excellent CX style. Asked crew for visa slip she gave me a customs one instead which caused hassle at immigration. Apart from the appalling bus boarding Ryanair style another good flight. Please invest in some airport bridge departures!

### Dragonair customer review
Flew from Hong Kong to Shanghai Pudong return. Both flights on the 33C aircraft with new economy seats. Dragonair fully deserves its best regional airline title. AVOD is the same as Cathay Pacific long haul aircrafts. Touch- screen monitor very responsive with many movies TV programmes games and music. Meal is very great with menu distributed. Cabin crew is very friendly and attentive. All flights arrive earlier than schedule. Dragonair can further improve in areas such as seat pitch. Cost-cutting is seen in minor areas such as no more drink and peanut distributed before the meal. Overall Dragonair deserves more than a 4 star rating.

### Dragonair customer review
Chiang Mai Economy Phuket - HKG business class. Flight out fine seats ok for space no entertainment at all not even a drop down screen. The boarding process was farcical lots of shoving to get onto a bus and driven out for ages onto the runway at a distant place really makes it a a budget experience. Food ok. Return on new business class configuration. Really nice new seats great AVOD and fabulous service as usual. Lovely main dishes and lots of extras. Would consider business class again if guaranteed new configuration.

### Dragonair customer review
I travelled economy from Bangalore to Hong Kong on Christmas eve. The flight was an A330-300 departing BLR at 3 am. I found the seats a little uncomfortable especially because I'm above average height. They were really hard to sleep on and I hardly slept a wink throughout the flight. Most of the crew were extremely professional moving quickly and efficiently throughout meal service except a few who seemed a little uptight. The meal was decent. They had pralines as an extra touch for Christmas and I thought this was a nice addition. I also found their IFE system Studio KA (similar to Cathay's Studio CX) to be really good they had a wide range of programmes with recent movies and music. The baggage claim was smooth with no problems. Overall the flight is okay to travel to HKG but it would be convenient if Cathay took over considering it is a night flight of 5 and a half hours.

KA 380 HKG-FUK on 25/12 and KA 381 FUK-HKG on 1/1. Outbound flight on an A330-300. Flight arrived a few minutes ahead of schedule. Staff service was quite impressive with efficient and friendly crew. Beef stew or curry both tasted good. Christmas chocolate was delightful. Wide selection of in-flight entertainment. Seat was ok but I don't really like the bulky air bag attached on the seat belt. Inbound flight was on an A330-300 as well. Did some research before the trip and knew it was the second oldest plane in Dragonair (21.2 years) but I was instantly surprised by the new cabin. Touchscreen and charger were available and again a wide selection of entertainment. Seat was more comfortable. Cabin crew was as good. The meal tasted better than it looked. Arrived ten minutes earlier as well. A very good experience with Dragonair which meets the standard of her parent company Cathay Pacific Airways.

### Dragonair customer review
Flight from HKG to TPE December 19 2013. Flight delayed by almost 1 hour. Boarding procedure is very slow. Aircraft used was an old A330. Seats though wide and comfy for an economy is really old and needs upholstery. Food however is terrible and the worst I've seen in a full service airline.

### Dragonair customer review
17 Nov. Xian Hong Kong in a new and spotlessly clean A321. Delayed departure due to late arrival but the arrival in HKG was on time after a flight of a little more than two hours. Seat comfort acceptable but not generous - it's just economy! Full passenger load in economy class but the crew managed everything really well. The hot snack served matches or even beats the quality of meals on similar European routes (e.g. FRA-MAD) by leading European airlines. Good beverage selection (even a choice of wines) including a refill "for the customer from overseas". My wife and myself were once again really content with this Dragonair flight.

### Dragonair customer review
KMG-HKG 25 Nov 2013 Economy. Typical economy class accommodations but a full meal efficiently served with free wine and other beverages on this roughly 800 mile flight by a hard-working and extremely cordial staff. Had AVOD which I didn't use but which appeared comparable to other airlines using this entertainment system. When boarding be prepared for a rush for the gate.

### Dragonair customer review
Hong Kong to Beijing on A330-300. My connecting flight (on another airline) was an hour late arriving giving us only 50 minutes before the scheduled departure. However a DragonAir agent was at the door with our names and she walked us through all the formalities (including fast track security) and taking us to the gate. We arrived with time to spare. Excellent service. On the plane comfortable seats and we had plenty of legroom. A high definition AVOD screen and good choice of entertainment. Complimentary and plentiful drinks service and an excellent seafood stir fry Chinese meal - one of the best meals in economy that I have ever had. Slight delay on departure but we landed at Beijing ahead of time. Only downside was that our bags didn't make it - although it was not a surprise due to the short connection in HK. Baggage agent very helpful and the bags arrived at my hotel the next morning.

### Dragonair customer review
KA890 HKG to PVG on 2 Oct 13. Boarding pass was issued and denied boarding at gate! Dragonair said they could not find the booking in their system (even after they issued boarding pass). 20 minutes discussion while the flight had gone they acknowledged they found the booking in their system. Finally Dragonair reissued another boarding pass for later flight 2.5 hours later. This is all because Dragonair overbooked its flight and decide to bump someone off.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-PEK. Took KA 974 (A320) and KA 901 (A330). KA 974 was awful but KA 901 was better. The seats on the A320 had a very limited recline. Seat was hard service was awful. There were no headrests. The seat was up a notch on the A330. Not very comfortable (but adjustable) headrests and the seat reclined a pretty comfortable 6". The seat pan goes forward while the seat reclines. I recommend take the A330 from HKG-PEK especially KA 992/3 with new product.

### Dragonair customer review
PVG-HKG - August 13 2013. I'm a Marco Polo member but have never flown with Dragonair only CX also on regional flights. This time I had to choose Dragonair the aircraft an A320 had one of the worst seats I have experienced there were no space for legs it was just like flying a budget airline. The only good thing was that arriving at the airport pretty early the guy at the check in could put me in the first flight leaving and the flight itself was delayed "only" of one hour a sort of miracle in Chinese skies.

### Dragonair customer review
Travelled with my family between Kolkata and Hong Kong and return. The first route was operated by an Airbus A321- very comfy and sufficient legroom. Food was excellent. Entertainment was limited. Good cabin crew. The return leg was on an A320 which had lesser legroom and no entertainment at all. Even food and cabin crew's attitude were below average. Could have been better given it was an international flight of around 4 hrs.

### Dragonair customer review
Hong Kong to Da Nang - flights on time food and beverages served on board very good with attentive staff on this short 1hr 25 minute flight. Only downside was the aircraft was situated quite a distance away from the terminal at HKIA which resulted in a long bus ride.

### Dragonair customer review
Flew from Qingdao to Hong Kong and return last weekend. Flight to HKG boarded quickly as all flights do in China had about a 1.5 hr delay on the ground prior to take off. Flight was on a newish Airbus A33O with PTV. Frequent updates from Northern Irish captain. Small but tasty meal served with wine (if requested) and generous refills given. Flight made up some time en route so we were not inconvenienced too much. Return leg was a little chaotic with 3 gate changes at HKG in 1 hour however despite everybody's best efforts flight took off on time. Flight was on older A330 with no PTV however with my kindle and IPod no problems to keep myself amused on a 3 hour flight. A nice dim sum lunch served again with wine if requested frequent updates from an Australian captain. Flight landed on time. I have flown Dragonair a lot and cannot fault them on regional flights to and from Hong Kong.

### Dragonair customer review
KA909 from Beijing to Hong Kong scheduled on 16.30 on 9th July 2013. Had 3 hours delay. The update from the flight deck was not frequent and quite poor. The cabin attendants gave even poorer answers. During our 3 hours prior to take off where we were inside the aircraft the supply w/ drinks and snacks was quite poor. They gave us some cookies and after that an ice cream which was part of the meal anyway. We had to inform them to replenish the toilet paper since they did not check themselves. However after arriving in Hong Kong we were surprised that we did not get a contact stand but a remote position. Then we waited quite a long time for the bus to arrive and were asked although the plane was long standing to sit down again "for our own safety". The plane was in bad shape the light was flickering and the edges of the seats were chipped out. Furthermore there was no individual entertaining system but the shared monitor hanging from the ceiling with only one selection. Will not recommend.

DAC-HKG. Paid around 850 USD (round trip) for a 1600 miles flight and Dragonair served me just like a budget airline. Asked for a glass of water during KTM stopover. It never arrived. No AVOD on this old A330. For the food it was just a main course and fruit. No bread no salad no dessert. Cabin crews were stone-faced. Will never fly this airline again.

I have been a Marco Polo member of Cathay Pacific for over 30 years and love HK and CX. On June 21 this year I flew from HK to Hangzhou on KA 620. It was 2.5 hours late in taking off. Plane arrived late to HKG we boarded 1.5 hours late. Sat onboard for another hour! First the crew said it was due to a blocked toilet then it was air traffic control. Anyway on the way back on June 23 HZ to HK on KA 621 guess what? Again exactly 2.5 hours delayed. The girls in the lounge told me that this was usual! Will never fly KA again!

### Dragonair customer review
Flew Dragonair in June 2013 from HK to Okinawa Japan and vice versa. Flight was delayed for around one hour for both sectors really could not recommend this airline. Though its rate charged was not 'budget' in any way the flight certainly felt like a Budget flight - you had to ask for cushion and blankets there was no inflight entertainment for the 2.5 hours flight and food given was below par.

### Dragonair customer review
Have been flying regularly from CNX to HKG as the flight avoids the need to transit BKK and its worth the late arrival in HKG for that alone. Flight is often almost full thanks to Chinese tour groups. Normally the flight is uneventful and the professionalism of the crew stands out. They are firm but polite in keeping order among the tour groups which is often not easy. One major negative was the meal on the HKG-CNX sector. They offered beef or chicken. I chose the chicken option which turned out to be inedible. I complained after the meal service was complete and they changed it for the beef option was quite tasty. As always the flight was slightly early. Pity their latest A320s aren't fitted with an entertainment system. PG has this for the 1 hour flight from CNX to BKK.

Hong Kong to Taipei 25 April. I was very impressed with Dragonair. The service was very efficient and polite. The IFE was limited and the food portion was a bit small but quite OK for such a short flight.

Flew Hangzhou to Hong Kong at the beginning of April and had 2 of my best Dragonair flights to date. The flights were empty with PTV both ways as both flights on newly acquired A330-300`s from CX. The food and service was great I would say better in fact than CX. Both flights left on time and arrived early with the usual good updates from the flight deck and crew. I will keep flying KA when I have the chance.

HGH-HKG return in March. Good flights and safety conscience crew with good updates from the flight deck. Aircraft had decent legroom and food was ok except they ran out of the western option when the flight was only around 60% full - but with only a 2hr flying time its not really an issue.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-Beijing. Great service but the meal was average for airlines. The cabin was 10% full so I was able to lay down on a row of 5 seats and take a nap. There was also excellent touch screen TVs with good English language movies and shows.

### Dragonair customer review
Flew HGH-HKG return in March. Both flights on time and planes in good condition. Leg room better than I remember and decent food. My only complaint would be that they ran out western breakfast with a load factor of around 60% but considering the flight time is only 2hrs food is not really a big deal. Staff great as always.

HKT-HKG-DAD. Evening flight from Phuket to Hong Kong. Check-in in Phuket was fast no queue and took the agent less than 2 minutes. Flight attendants seemed to have adopted the holiday mood and were very cheerful and chatty with all passengers albeit in their new but not eye pleasing uniform. Full business class but they were very efficient and finished a cocktail service and a dinner within 90 minutes after take off. They even did a second cocktail service just before landing for a 3 hour flight. I chose the Thai duck curry for dinner and it was very tasty and the vegetables were not dry. Arrival in Hong Kong was through the satellite terminal and the bus ride to the main building was not very pleasant. Went through security to the CX lounge but was told that I could not stay overnight there as the lounge would close at 1am the lounge agent asked me to wait and she helped me book a room in the airport hotel. She then escorted me back to the arrivals level through immigration skipping the queues. The flight to Da Nang the next morning was less than 90 minutes in an all economy class A320 and they served a tasty full hot breakfast. Dragonair has consistent quality and seem to be more passenger oriented and personal than their parent airline Cathay. Definitely recommendable.

SHA-HKG 22/3/13. I usually look forward to flying Dragon Air as the service sets them apart from some of the other carriers on this route. Arriving at terminal 1 in Shanghai was a bit of a mess. Long lines even for the Emerald Members. Was informed that the lounge was full but provided RMB 100 to get a snack. Boarding efficient A330-200 seat was comfortable but the attendants on this flight were certainly nowhere near the standard. They were uncaring and left the meal trays for quite a while. Only one drink offering and they disappeared. Kind of hard to do on a 2 hour flight but they managed. Might pass on the next chance to use their service.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-KHH-HKG. Throughout the flight even though offering a satisfying meal of noodles it was absolutely boring. There is no entertainment device except a magazine with lots of advertisements. There is nothing to do except sleep. Nevertheless the seats are quite comfortable if you ignore the reclining problem. Overall it is far from satisfactory.

### Dragonair customer review
Travelled on the new cabin on its A330 en-route HKG-PEK. The call bell reading light TV control panel are all on the screen it's just one touch. Entertainment on demand lots of movies in the system and I could only finish one during this 3 hours flight. Food was ok with a nice touch of a little tub Haagen Daz. Cabin attendants were young and friendly.

Flew from Xiamen to Hong Kong on two occasion and was delayed twice. Consequently missed my connecting flight back to Penang. Although the alternative flight arrangements were fine I still would not recommend flying with Dragonair especially if you are on a tight schedule.

### Dragonair customer review
Tried the comparatively new non-stop service from CNX to HKG and return. Flight was completely full but was boarded efficiently and left gate on time. As someone had already commented the newer A320s on this route have more personal space at each seat. Choice of pasta with chicken or Thai chicken curry on way out. Same pasta or beef with rice on way back. Flight to HKG arrived 55 minutes early 25 minutes early on return leg. Quality FAs who had the rare quality of telling passengers to stay in their seats while the aircraft was taxiing to the gate. I have flights booked for march and april and i notice that the price from may onwards has gone down.

Chiang Mai to Hong Kong. Flight was full but despite that there was an unusually large amount of cabin crew in the flight. However they all were busy taking care of passengers. The service was pretty good and flight attendants very attentive. The food was above average surprisingly. Seating was comfortable and combined with the excellent service and good food the short trip was overall pretty enjoyable.

Took Dragonair from KHH to HKG a few years ago but the service was horrible. Flight was delayed 5 hours and I had had the worst in-flight meal that time. I was very disappointed originally. Took Dragonair A330 from Hong Kong to Shanghai Pudong. The best in-flight meal I'd had. The cabin service was very nice with helpful crew and satisfactory in-flight entertainment. Seats are fine as well. Really good flight experience this time. Will consider Dragonair for short flights.

### Dragonair customer review
Flew today from Hong Kong to Chengdu (12/11/2012). We were traveling with a 3 year old child. We checked in and they said we could not sit together as it was a full flight. They told me I should have done that prior to arriving at airport? They then refused to ask anyone if they would swap. I tried to pay the extra for business class so we could sit together and they said we would have to pay for 3 new tickets. Staff then told me I better go as the plane was boarding and would miss the flight. Onboard they only serve dim sum or eggs no matter what time of day. Very poor in flight service however pilots and flight attendants friendly. Would not fly with them again.

### Dragonair customer review
From HKG to PVG. The flight was full and on time. Dinner was quite good. Ice-cream service was combined with meal service. Crew helpful and hardworking. Boarding procedure should be finished more quickly.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-PEK and NKG-HKG. Dragonair is fast becoming one of my favourite airlines. Apart from the usual traffic delays out of Nanjing not the fault of Dragonair my recent flights were very good. Seating meals wine and general service are all excellent. I only wish Dragonair flew to Australia.

### Dragonair customer review
The plane was heavily delayed on both legs of the trip both to and from Beijing. Despite this the trip was nice with comfortable seats for Economy and (dare I say it) delicious food served. The entertainment system was weird though - while you could switch between channels on the TV in front of you it took about ten seconds to catch up with your choice which made it difficult to see what was on which channel.

### Dragonair customer review
A return flight between PVG and HKG. The flights were on time. Served a hot meal which was quite good. Air fare was fair.

### Dragonair customer review
Hong Kong - Hangzhou on A320. Managed to get the emergency exit for the first time on Dragon Air. I was very happy as their A320's have such a tight seat pitch I cannot sit with my legs straight. The emergency exit row had more leg room but only equal to the standard seat pitch on SAA. Service was great food good and they are very safety conscience. Always good updates from the flight deck.

### Dragonair customer review
Flew from Chongqing to Hong Kong and the flight went very smoothly with excellent catering and very good crew. The only down side is the A320 seating looks a bit worn but otherwise a very good experience.

### Dragonair customer review
Hong Kong to Beijing flight was delayed for 40 mins. The seat was comfortable and food was great. However there was no personal television screen.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-OKA-HKG with Airbus 320 in KA economy. Return flight was delayed by 2 hours but we were kept informed by the ground crew. Apart from the chaos at OKA airport the flights themselves were pleasant. No IFE but the seats were comfortable with good leg room. The crew was friendly and served hot tasty meals on both sectors. Alcohol (beer wine) was provided free of charge during meal times and upon request. Overall a good experience and recommended for short intra-Asian flights.

### Dragonair customer review
Hangzhou to Hong Kong on A330. Flight experience was very poor. Weather was unstable and flight delayed from 15.35 to 23.45. All passengers complained about the incident but all managers seemed to be hiding. However the worst yet to come after we boarded at 23.45 there were a group of angry passengers who refused to get onboard so another 2 hours wait to handle this group. Eventually we landed at HKG at 03.41 the next day.

### Dragonair customer review
SHA-HKG. Flight was an hour late leaving however this is usual from Shanghai. Seats comfortable and service was excellent. Well mannered and well trained crew. Food good and beverages were perfectly adequate.

### Dragonair customer review
Hong Kong to Dhaka return (via Kathmandu). Not impressed. A330 aircraft was looking quite old and worn seats were frayed and stained as was the carpet. Flight attendants were stony faced and really didn't seem too happy with having to serve customers. At least the flights were on time and we had no issues with our check-in or baggage. There was also almost nothing in the way of English inflight entertainment which made for a long couple of flights.

### Dragonair customer review
TAO-HKG A330. Attendants showed us to our seats take off on time. Everyone served a beverage in 20 mins. There was a hot meal service with 2 selections - tasty and plentiful. Second beverage service then a tea / coffee service. Fluent English and Mandarin spoken by the crew. AVOD in the back of the seat however I did not use it. US Airlines should take the example set by this carrier.

### Dragonair customer review
BJS-HKG on A330. Seats were narrow but still comfortable. I was surprised to have PTV on this flight which was only 3 hours. Full flight out of BJS we were on the tarmac for nearly 2 hours before being cleared for takeoff. Crew were friendly and food decent.

### Dragonair customer review
PEK-HKG return in Economy. Older seats with no AVOD or personal screen. Pitch ok. Not a great seat but alright for a domestic flight in China. All seats came with a bottle of mineral water during boarding. Food and service were above par for a domestic flight. Meals good and the Haagen Dazs ice cream is a great finish. I enjoyed the full range of complementary drinks including cocktails and select teas in economy.

### Dragonair customer review
Hong Kong-Kunming Chengdu-Hong Kong. Both flights on time or ahead of schedule. I had a connection from Macau via Sky Pier and this was a very smooth and pleasant operation. My luggage arrived with me to Kunming.

### Dragonair customer review
Connected to KA from a CX ORD-HKG flight and flew HKG-KHH-HKG. Great flights overall - Airbus 330-300. There is a lot of leg room seat back screen with a few dozen channels. Crew attentive and friendly and helped put bags in the overhead. KHH airport is now one of my favorites - great kids play area and quaint all around. HKG took a very long walk from what looked like the central area to the wing where the KHH flight was boarding took a good 30 minutes. The food was very nice even on this short flight.

HKG-KMG. Short 2 hour flight. Check-in was perfect. Boarding smooth on time departure. Friendly and professional cabin crew. Meal choice and quality of the meal was good. Arrival was on schedule. Only downside is gate 76 at HKIA flying to KMG.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-PEK and NKG-HKG. Excellent flights with remarkably good on-time performance despite some occasional bad weather. Menus and food are first rate as is the wine offering. One of the best set of flights I have had on any airline in a long time.

### Dragonair customer review
Hong Kong to Chengdu return. The unexpected upgrade to business class on the run up to Chengdu was a bonus. The lounge in Hong Kong while not as posh as Cathay's is certainly pleasant. Smooth flight wonderful FA's good food and a great team on the ground.

### Dragonair customer review
PKG to PVG. Cabin crews are all attentive always smiling. Food is good smooth flight and Dragonair always my first choice for my Shanghai Trip.

### Dragonair customer review
Hong Kong to Fukuoka economy class on A320. After a miserable flight from Sydney to Hong Kong in Cathay Pacific A330-300 it was a most pleasant experience. The cabin and amenities were spotlessly clean food was exceptional and friendly and courteous cabin staff went out of their way to ensure the flight was an enjoyable experience. I thoroughly recommend Dragonair.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-BJS. First time flying with Dragonair and was very impressive! New clean cabin comfortable seats and great food the service was excellent and would rival many of the long haul carriers. Really friendly professional Crew very fluent in English. Was even impressed by the gifts given to children during the flight. Only thing I would mention is the ground staff could have been a little friendlier and it was annoying and difficult to find the desk to get a boarding pass again even though I had been given one already by Qantas so I was unsure what that was all about. All in all a refreshing and pleasant flight and will certainly try and fly with Dragonair again if the opportunity comes up again.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-BLR-HKG. First time and I was impressed with the service. Both flights were late night schedules so I mostly slept. However on a 5.5 hr flight they served 2 meals and the service was so unobtrusive that they did not disturb those of us that did not want to eat. When I dropped my glasses the flight attendant picked them up cleaned them and handed them back to me. Entertainment was limited. Cabin was cheerful and clean. Seats were so-so they were angled lie-flat.

### Dragonair customer review
Although Hong Kong to Xiamen was a short flight all of the cabin crew tried their best to serve and collecting the meals efficiently and Dragonair used A330 with PTVs for this short flight. It was very comfortable.

### Dragonair customer review
Having flown Cathay Pacific from Manila to Hong Kong and received an average service we expected Dragonair on the return leg to be worse. Checking in at the Airport Express terminal in Hong Kong was painless the journey from railway station to plane was simple. The only complaint is that we had to take a bus from a far gate at Hong Kong to the plane. Boarding the plane the cabin crew were smart and friendly offering us a choice of Hong Kong Filipino and International newspapers. We had a nice full meal with chicken rice and vegetables followed by fresh fruit and tea and coffee for dinner. Seats were comfortable if a little too short for me to rest my head comfortably when sleeping. Arrival was on time and passage through the airport was quick it restored my faith in short-haul airline travel around Asia.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-MNL. Check-in was handled smoothly at HKG train station. It really paid off to check in online 48 hrs prior so I was able to get seats on the second row of the A320. I must say that I am not a fan of A320's due to the cramped seating (I'm 6 ft. tall) and this was no exception however everything else worked well. The purser and her assistant greeted passengers at the door of the aircraft which looked brand new and smelt clean too. Dinner was served on the short hop to MNL. Wine and drinks were offered after the dinner trays were served. Service was good and made for a pleasant flight. The entertainment options were more than sufficient for the 2hr flight.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-PEK-HKG. The flight to Beijing on a new A320 was great. No PTVs only overhead screens but with an adjustable headrest for comfort. Crew was great with chicken rice for an early dinner. The return trip was good except when a flight attendant rudely told me to switch off my camera when I was boarding. Aircraft was old but surprisingly there was IFE. Dinner was beef with macaroni overall the flights were OK.

### Dragonair customer review
Hong Kong-Xiamen. The plane left on schedule. Aeroplane interior was spotless serviced by a very charming and attentive cabin crew.

### Dragonair customer review
Shanghai to Hong Kong A330 was OK to HKG. On the way back A320 was so small. I thought the space between two seats were not big enough. Food and wine were great. No IFE on A320. FA's were friendly.

### Dragonair customer review
Horrible check in service at Phnom Penh. The counter representative couldn't get their stories straight and lied to me multiple times trying to make me pay for my flight a second time. I think they are trying to run some type of scam. They had the nerve to ask me to pay for the flight in cash as this was their new company policy and that even though I paid via a credit card through a travel agency they said that they don't accept credit cards from the USA in Phnom Penh. Only when I threaten to call the police and report a scam did they grant me this one-time exception to their 'new' policy.

### Dragonair customer review
Hong Kong-Shanghai seats were just like premium economy. Crew excellent and very attentive. They didn't get my vegetarian meal request but still managed to serve me well.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-PEK-HKG Business. To Beijing flight seat is 11A. Can't understand why no AVOD implemented on A330. Still have some great movies. Unacceptable that we still have to review Kai Tak time as we have take bus from Gate 522. Returning seat 16K.Better meals than first flight.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-Hanoi economy. Delayed flight (as is normal) by about 30 minutes and rather chaotic boarding as economy all told to line up separately- to get onto the same bus as premium. Onboard crew do dinner drinks etc in a short time. Flight menu also given in French English and Chinese before trolley reaches you.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-HGH on a A321. Another good experience. Flight left on time and arrived a few minutes early. Cabin clean and crew helpful and efficient. Pilot gave updates on weather and other information. The only downside was the slightly cramped seat pitch and had the window seat which made it feel worse.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-TPE - Evening flight on A320 out of satellite terminal. Very easy taking the bus from the main terminal. Flight nearly full. Original equipment (when flight was booked) was A330 though my aisle seat request was honored precisely. Very short route for Dragonair though service was very good. Attendants served dinner efficiently and offered coffee and tea service. Food very good cookies also served and orange juice. Seats were standard economy. No IFE system but flight very short and by the time dinner was over we were desceding to TPE. TPE-HKG A330 from terminal 2. Early morning flight. Boarding efficient and easy. Flight only 1/2 full. Flight attendants were excellent and attentives. Breakfast was egg/omelet with noodles orange juice and pineapple cake. Large selection of English and Chinese newspapers offered at jetway entry. Baggage delivery at HKG seemed to take longer than usual.

### Dragonair customer review
Hong Kong to Shanghai Pudong. A330-300 overbooked Y with many upgrades given to pax with status mainly seated in the 2nd section of business. Seats weren't special the normal regional business one would expect had a footrest and 135 degree recline but without a PTV. Service and food was awesome despite the amount of pax and short flight. I find catering on Dragonair better than Cathay Pacific - almost seems as though Cathay doesn't really care about what they are serving. The senior purser and her crew were very friendly and attentive to pax. Although Dragonair seats are ill-equipped a PTV is not necessary on regional flights where the airborne time is just barely enough for meal service.

### Dragonair customer review
Hong Kong - Guangzhou. Check in for the early morning flight was very busy at the airport. As I have a connecting flight that night on Air France I asked the ground staff whether bags could be checked through to the next flight as one can the other way round. She made a lot of different calls but the answer was still no. The flight departed from the remote terminal (which seems to be a Dragonair exclusive terminal) which is a bus ride away. Take at least a good 15 minutes to get to the gate. Nothing could go wrong on a 30 minutes ride in the air. Upon arrival checked with the Dragonair ground staff in Guangzhou and he was apologetic about my bag not being checked through and asked if I could lock my bag and he would keep it for me which I could claim it back that night from their office in the hotel opposite to the terminal. Wonderful service and their office does remain open as promised that evening.

### Dragonair customer review
KTM-HKG-CGK A330-300 very full flight crew were very attentive cabin was hot despite a midnite flight. Supper was okay IFE was working OK but it was average. Had a better experience when we continued flying HKG-CGK where we were flying CX.

### Dragonair customer review
Hong Kong-PVG return cabin crew friendly. Meals great on both and seats comfortable. HKG-PVG was A320 and return was A330 with no ptv's. Dragonair lacks PTV on the A330's.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-PVG. Business class seats were a joke - no in seat power no ptv's a requested meal that was awful service 2nd rate - they jst seemed more interested in running around looking busy. Overall really disappointed - not to mention the delays. They charge higher than everyone else and this is the product you get - simply never again.

### Dragonair customer review
BLR-Shanghai-BLR - I was anticipating an good experience as I had flown Cathay once before. However was very disappointed. The seats were tight and cramped. The service was efficient but no one had a smile on their face. It felt like they were there just to do their job. The food was OK nothing to write home about. Was happy when we landed at our stop over in Hongkong. Flight from HK to Shanghai was much better. Much more better service but again food was average. Return flight was delayed by an hour and a half and we thought we would miss our connecting flight but that flight was also delayed from Hongkong. Long lines to board the aircraft and the air conditioning was not working either in the airport or on the plane when we went in. Took some time for the plane to cool down. Again the crew was not a happy-looking lot. Maybe it must be this sector? Next time will try another airline when flying in this part of the world.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-KHH return. The first leg was A330 with first class return A330 with long-haul product. Business class seats were open for economy class passengers on the first leg and were fantastic with great legroom and comfort. Meal was nice. Return flight standard with PTVs. The meal was okay though not as great as the first leg.

### Dragonair customer review
TPE-HKG on A330-300. Flight on time. Very comfortable interior with personal TV. Excellent service from cabin crew - friendly and polite. Decent breakfast meal with a pineapple tart (Taiwan local snack). However the TV screen was very dim although the brightness was maximized.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-PNH return. The first leg was A320 while return was A330 with first class. The meal was fantastic for the first leg but no inflight entertainment. For the return leg the service was a surprise! Maybe is because I was sitting at the rear of the aircraft the western meal choice was no longer available. However crew were nice to give us their crew meal (beef noodle).

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-PEK PEK-HKG. Compared to the economy seats on Cathay these older seats were like a layzboy. Food good and staff friendly attentive. The check-in staff were very helpful as well.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG to Hangzhou with 0800 flight in C class. Arrived 45min prior to departure time and just made the flight in time as there were so many people queuing for immigration and security. Also our gate was at the new North Satelite Concourse which meant that we had to take a bus to reach the terminal. Flight attendants were efficient and friendly throughout the flight and handed us drinks and blankets before we departed. Breakfast was not too bad and service great. The aircraft was an A321 and had quite comfortable business class seats for a regional plane. We arrived early in Hangzhou and got our luggage fairly quickly. However the priority labels are not really usefull in China as they just throw out the first luggage which comes out. This is however not Dragonair's fault. Their inflight product is superior in comparison to their other rivals.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-Beijing. Good outbound food and tvs all fine good service and all went well. Return- delayed 40 minutes on plane. Apparently this happens all the time and Dragonair are famous for being late. The flight was fine but I find Dragonair late by more than 30 minutes 60% of the time not good.

### Dragonair customer review
Hanoi-Hong Kong. Great cabin crew professional and courteous. Free newspapars great food and comfortable seating.

### Dragonair customer review
Beijing - Hong Kong. A330 was relatively empty. Bottle of water in seat back. Food was ok. Older entertainment system but good movie shown. Excellent service and courtesy shown by cabin crew.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-FOC-HKG Top marks for the cabin crews on both flights. Very attentive and delightful service with excellent meals both ways. Seats quite comfortable for the 1.5 hour flights. My only negative encounter was with Dragonair counter staff on the return. I checked the webpage for baggage limitations before showing up at the airport. When checking in we were told we could not take three bags each even though the webpage clearly said otherwise. After much discussion we were permitted to proceed but my advice is to get something concrete from them in writing on baggage allowances before flying with Dragonair.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-BLG-HKG. Outbound trip - flight announced as ready for boarding when it wasn't (typical for Dragonair) and took off 30 minutes late. Plane had been changed from what is shown on their website with a seat that that is not appropriate for a 6 hour flight (narrow poor legroom and limited recline). Return trip departed 90 minutes late better seating but front row was quite noisy and hard to get any sleep. Landed about 40 minutes behind schedule. If the flights took off on time and used the configuration they advertise then this would be a decent option but hard to recommend as it is.

### Dragonair customer review
Hong Kong to Shanghai is just a quite short journey around 2 hours flight but KA provided a long-haul aircraft which includes PTV. Inflight entertainment enjoyable. 1 hour after departure the cabin crew served us meal. The food tasted very delicious also Haagen-Dazs ice cream was given. The service was also great.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-PVG-HKG. Cabin crew very friendly and helpful. Crew ratio seems higher than other airlines with same aircraft type. Service is friendly but a bit chaotic in a charming way. Seems to be KA standard. Outbound on A330 with entertainment system. Seat pitch rather tight compared to other Asian carriers one noticed it on the inbound flight on an A321 that was full. Unfortunately PVG ground crew (China Eastern staff?) allow huge suitcases as cabin baggage. Therefore people that do not participate in the gate scrum end up having their cabin luggage under the front seat with no room to move at all due to the tight seating. Food was good and ice cream a very nice touch. A pity that at PVG for regular economy class check in 4 counters were open for e-check in only one. This counter was blocked by a family having way to much luggage and none of the ground staff had the idea to invite people from the baggage drop of queue to the regular one. Upon request they tried to but passengers from other queue ignored it and staff just did not care any longer. A good 4 star experience.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-PVG-HKG. Have become a big fan of online check in with all airlines now and Dragonair was no different efficient and no fuss. I was in the departure lounge for a late lunch within 15 minutes of arriving at HKIA. A321 aircraft was clean and comfortable. Seat width was better than expected from this type of aircraft. A hot meal was served on this flight and was a surprise as it was only a 2 hour flight. The flight attendants seemed to be rushed off their feet but all coped well with their duties and managed to keep a smile for the passengers. Return flight was similar. The only downside was that we still had to be transported by bus to the aircraft from the gate and vice versa on the return flight. I would have thought given the size of HKIA and Dragonair being based out of Hong Kong they would have a gate with a walkway to the aircraft. There was a walkway to the terminal at PVG.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-PVG. Boarding chaotic with everyone rushing the jetway at once. A330 aircraft very clean interior. Seats were comfortable with a decent pitch. Water bottle was placed in each seat pocket no IFE but short programs shown on main screen. FA's were very friendly and visible. Menus were distributed followed by a full lunch and then Haagen Dazs chocolate ice cream. Drinks were plentiful throughout the short 2 hour flight. Very enjoyable flight.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-HGH PVG-HKG in J Class. Lounge at HKG airport was weird one does not have shower facility. Lounge at PVG was good big step up from old lounge. Onboard service was average food fantastic. AVOD was really bad A330 and A320 does not have personal TV. Dragonair really should upgrade its facilities in Business class. I would prefer Air China business class than Dragonair.

### Dragonair customer review
Hong Kong-Chengdu. Flights fine but late both ways and delayed on plane. Actual flights fine but delayed on 2 other flights recently to Shanghai and Beijing with little explanation.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-TPE both ways. Not a nice experience travelling with Dragonair. There was a passenger (an old lady) sitting beside me who had made an on-line request for a vegetarian food. However the flight attendants had missed her out. No apology was given to the lady but a rude flight attendant said: "Are you sure you have made a special request online?". The food is OK for both ways. Will still consider Dragonair if I do not have a tight schedule connecting other flights at HKIA but Dragonair will be definitely not my first choice.

### Dragonair customer review
Phuket to Hong Kong. Astonishing experience with this airline my business trip ended a couple of days early but there were no business seats available wanting to get home quickly I downgraded myself to economy but asked if I could still go to the business lounge to wait for the flight. I was rather rudely informed that would not be possible. This rather thoughtless act on Dragonair's part means I will now avoid them at all costs in the future.

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-PEK in Y class. A good experience all round. A newish A330 with seat-back TVs economy class 75% full and I felt the space was quite tight with someone sitting in the adjacent seat. Meal was delicious as was Haagen Dasz ice cream handed out. There was in-seat power too which is rare in economy! Dragonair felt like a full-service airline whereas Air China on this route always felt dated and slightly unsafe!

### Dragonair customer review
HKG-PEK A330. The crew was experienced and did their utmost best to satisfy a customer since the flight was half empty the FA offered me a second meal and ice cream which was delicious for Economy food. PTV not AVOD but Dragonair have good movie choices on the flight. The seat was comfortable with adjustable headrest.
