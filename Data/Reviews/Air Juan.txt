### "my refund is still in queue"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight with Air Juan in March 2019 with departure date on the 2nd August 2019. The airline then informed me about the flight cancellation on the 31st July 2019. They offered me options of rebook, refund or travel credits. I chose to have a refund and got the form to fill in. I sent the filled from back on the 1st of August 2019. Then it took 27 days from the airline to reply and they then promised the refund within 65-70 business days. Now I have contacted the airline once again on the 28th January 2020 and they replied that my refund is still in queue.

### "not received refund after 9 months"
Do not book with this airline. It is a complete scam. Flights are regularly cancelled hours before the scheduled take-off for "maintenance" and then a refund is never given. My wife and I were left scrambling to arrange alternative flights and we have not received any refund after 9 months of waiting. If you look online you will find hundreds of similar reviews.

### "they stopped replying to my follow up e-mails"
I was in Manila and had only 2 days to go for diving. I've chosen (close by) Puerto Galera and since my time was limited I booked a flight with Air Juan. They cancelled my flight approx. 10 days before my trip and sent me a request for reimbursement to fill in. I sent back the request on 18 April! Recently they stopped replying to my follow up e-mails. I booked a flight with another Manila-based company, they also cancelled but sent me back money in a couple of weeks. It is worth mentioning that I also lost the payment of 1 night in a very nice hotel there since I was unable to travel by car/bus and ferry (limited time).

### "No refund after flight cancellation"
Busuanga to Caticlan. No refund after flight cancellation The flight was canceled allegedly due to aircraft maintenance. It was pre-paid by credit card and Air Juan offered me a refund. I sent them the refund form but I never received the 7,900 PHP back.

### "cheated out of their money"
In March we booked our flights with Air Juan for the month of May with 400 Euro and paid the same. Two days before the first flight came an Email with cancellation due to problems and the safety of the passengers go. A few days later came the cancellation that the return flight was also canceled. At the request to refund the money we only got standard emails. This tactic is annoying and so we threatened with a complaint to the aviation authority and appointed a lawyer. Then we switched on our bank immediately after arrival in Germany. Over a complaint with the credit card we got now after 3 months our money back again. We never received a message again with an apology from AirJuan. Thousands of tourists are cheated out of their money by Air Juan's tactics. Many tourists either do not answer at all or do not know how to get their money back. During our holiday in El Nido, Bohol and Cebu we met 8 tourists who also got a cancellation one day before the flight. So stay away from this airline. Then better with Philippine Airlines", AirSwift or Cebu Pacific.

### "nothing has been refunded yet"
Caticlan to Busuanga. Our flight booked months before (october 2018) was canceled one week before departure due to "aircraft maintenance inspection". They sent us a document for the refund request, stating that the amount would be refunded within 35-40 working days. The canceled flight was scheduled for the 16th february 2019, today is the 24th june 2019 and nothing has been refunded yet! I keep sending them emails every week, and every email I send, they always reply in the same vague and useless way, stating that "they will contact the involved office and will send a copy of the transaction once available", which never arrives! I will be forced to send people directly to their office in Manila in order to be able to get my 13,000 PHP back, just for the canceled flight!! Where I live, since it is the airline's fault, they should have even provided an alternative way to get to destination and provided the extra night in the hotel we had to spend!! These people really don't know how to treat their customers.

### "the worst experiences of airlines"
Manila to Puerto Galera. Air Juan gave me by far the worst experiences of airlines ever. On my first flight 2017, they managed to forget my luggage -on a 3 passenger flight! In January 2019 I booked 2 tickets for a return flight to PG. On March 11 it was rescheduled, on March 29 it was cancelled. To this very day I have not received the refund of PhP 20k. I keep writing, Air Juan keeps dodging. Broke? Lazy?Incompetent? I warn everybody of booking or flying with such an unreliable operation!

### "have never been refunded"
Manila to Puerto Galera. They cancelled the flights 4 days prior to departure, and despite my several requests, I have never been refunded. Do not fly with this company.

### "stopped replying to my emails"
This airline cancels flights on people if they can sell the seat for more money. They cancelled both my flights because I had purchased the tickets as a "Super Saver" price. I have followed their procedures and policy's but they have stopped replying to my emails for a refund, 122 business day later. The last email was "It's with the accounting department and they will process the return shortly".

### "still waiting for my refund"
Booked a flight from Manila to Puerto Galera in October 2018. Informed days before that that flight had been cancelled due to routine maintenance. If routine then why the unexpected unavailability of the aircraft? Was given the choice of a refund or credit towards another flight, so opted for credit (silly me). Re-booked for a Puerto Galera to Manila flight in March 2019 (and had to pay an extra 1,000 pesos for the privilege). Days before that flight it was also cancelled for - you guessed it - routine maintenance. This time I opted for a refund and after filling out and returning the form was told it would take 25 to 30 working days to process. 40 days later, I'm still waiting for my refund. After numerous emails, the response to which was always a copperplate 'your refund is still in process' I contacted my bank for a charge-back, only to be informed that the 90 day expiry had passed already. So tough luck. Total scam.

### "never recommend this carrier"
Don't book with this airline. They may cancel your flight last minute and leave you scrambling to get a flight out through other airlines. Refund has been on process for more than 2 mos. Haven't returned the Php33,000.00 refund until now. I will never recommend this carrier to anyone.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Not Verified |  Manila to Puerto Gallera. Avoid at all costs. I've booked three times with these jokers and every time they have cancelled the day before the flight. They claim maintenance as the reason for the cancellation but after three incidents I decided to look into it and it appears as though they are selling already sold tickets at higher last-minute rates and then cancelling passengers that booked in advance at better rates. The last time I wanted a refund, they refused unless I signed a bunch of legal documents that would waive all my rights. I refused to sign and I'm still waiting for a refund.

### "money has not been refunded"
Not Verified |  Cebu City to Siquijor Island. Very unreliable airline. They cancelled our flight two hours before departure. The money paid has not been refunded so far, more than 6 weeks later, after their own set deadline!

### "delayed by 2 days"
Puerto Princesa to Cuyo. Looks like a fraud airline. First my flight delayed by 2 days, later delayed again by day. In the end we did not fly, had to arrange a ferry lost 2 days of holidays. Worst thing is that we are still waiting for a refund that is already way after deadline

### "the flight was cancelled"
Puerto Galera to Manila. I purchased my ticket 4 months in advance and got the "Super Saver" rate. The night before the flight, Air Juan emailed me and informed me that the flight was cancelled due to "extended Aircraft Maintenance Inspection". I later found out that the flight did go as scheduled. I can only assume that Air Juan sold my ticket for more money and cancelled my "Super Saver" ticket. I had to take a bus and boat to get to my destination. On the return flight, Air Juan re-scheduled my flight from 1:00pm to 8:10am. Again, the flight at 1:00pm did depart. I can only assume they had an empty seat on the 8:10am flight and moved me as they can sell the 1:00pm flight for more money. The plane and pilot were very good on the return flight. Don't buy a "Super Saver" fair and expect Air Juan to honor it!

### "a very bad airline"
Flight cancelled. Cancellation after check in. Bad weather! Sipalay hotel confirmed weather quite good. Only 4 persons on flight. All of us were thinking cancellation because of lack of enough customers. No compensation at all. We all lost 1 night in Sipalay and had to book a hotel in Cebu. Air Juan is a very bad airline.

### "Not reliable in the slightest"
Subic to Manila. Not reliable in the slightest. I've flown 5 flights, 3 of which have been cancelled. When they cancel a flight you wait 30-45 days for a refund. This one is the last straw. My buddy booked a flight for us from Subic to Manila. The night before they changed the flight from 6:30 to 8:10 departure. Flight was delayed until 8:52. If we had just taken a taxi and left at 6 am we would be almost to Manila by now. So we've spent over twice the amount of money and saved 0 time.

### "still have not refunded us"
On October 18th we booked 2 roundtrip Manila Puerto Galera paid with Master Card. On October 22nd, Air Juan sent us an e.mail to inform us that our flights were canceled. They offered to refund us and confirmed that the refund should be between 25 and 30 days after this confirmation. This delay is already inadmissible because we learned that the day of booking, they had the perfect knowledge that the flight would not be possible. So they cashed the money illegally and, to date, they still have not refunded us. You might think a temporary problem. It is not so. A friend who wanted to visit us ended up in the same situation. While Air Juan no longer insures seaplane flights since October 20, according to the Manila station manager, last week they booked 2 passengers and 2 days later canceled their flights after collecting the ticket prices.

### "a disappointing experience"
Busuanga to Boracay. I cannot recommend this airline based on my experience with Air Juan. My flight was cancelled, and instead of coming and telling the passengers they left us sitting for hours in the very hot airport terminal until eventually we had to go back through security and ask what has happened at their desk. They told us the flight was cancelled and said we have to go back again through security and tell the other passengers. They then refused to pay for the hotel that we had booked at the next destination which lost us money due to their error. This is not acceptable. Furthermore, they then booked us into a very cheap hotel in the local town and the replacement flight the next day was delayed. We lost 2 days of our vacation due to sitting in the airport and were left out of pocket for the hotel. Overall a disappointing experience.

### "customer service not accountable"
Not Verified |  I didn’t take any flight of Air Juan yet, I was willing to take, however, my first booking was an one-way flight from Manila to Puerto Galera, it was cancelled because of bad weather condition, they gave us option either rebook another flight without extra charge or refund. I rebooked a flight back to Manila from puerto galera as my option. However, I was cancelled again with the excuse of bad weather condition. I was disappointed not to have a seaplane experience. The more frustrating thing happened later was the process of refund. They promise us to get the refund within 25-30 working days. However, today is the 30th working day excluding weekends and Philippine holidays, my refund has been processed at all. The Customer service is really bad because anytime I was trying to email to ask for some updates, they would reply with exactly same reply without any updated explanation for the process of refund, basically they would just tell you to wait and say that they would make sure to expedite my refund process. The negative impression for Air Juan was not from the flight experience, mostly from their customer service which is not accountable and useful at all. For now, I even don’t know I can get my refund back.

### "disappointing and unprofessional airline"
This airline doesn’t even deserve a single star! It is a very disappointing and unprofessional airline! We booked our tickets,3 of us from Puerto Princessa to Coron on Jan 2 2018 and had everything paid from accommodations to our activities in both cities. But airjuan totally wrecked our vacation! They cancelled our flight due to the technical issue as they said in a peak season. Our nightmare in this company didn’t end there. They have given us the option to refund our money and give us a flight credit. They told us that the processing will take 20-25 days but it is already on the 32nd day today yet we haven’t receive any words from them. We sent emails for an update but no one from their team replies.

### "flight was comfortable"
Flight was a little delayed, but pilots were courteous and apologetic. No problem at all. Great view over Calamian Islands, and then Northern Palawan. Got into San Vicente airport and was greeted by pretty ground staff. Flight was comfortable despite some bumps. Normally I am scared in small planes but pilots and plane were reassuring.

### "disappointed and angry"
Air Juan is really like a scam. On 31 Aug 2017, I was due to fly from Caticlan to Coron. It was a sea plane with 8 seats. There were 3 passagers on the list told by the ground officer. Finally only I showed up. After I arrived at airport at 10:45, I sit and wait for the ground officer. At 11:10 I cleared all the security check to proceeded to the gate 2. Waited for 1hr, my flight was supposed to be departed at 12:00, but no flight showed up. Then at 12:30 the ground officer told me that the flight was cancelled due to the bad weather. The ground officer then helped me to call the head quarter of Air Juan. They said due to the bad weather in Manila, the flight was cancelled. Then I took Air asia to Manila, and I found that the sky is clear and even the staff of AirAsia said that the weather in Manila was fine. I believe that due to the few number of passengers, Air Juan cancelled the flight. it was a disaster for me, because I booked an expensive resort in Coron. And the airline is just make me disappointed and make me angry after I found out the truth in Manila.
