### "experience was very good"
Not Verified |   We were booked on Condor, but last minute this flight was changed to Wamos. Our experience was very good with this airline. The crew was polite and efficient. The service and food was very good.

### “the entire experience was good”
We were initially a bit disappointed when Etihad did not use its own aircraft on the route between Abu Dhabi and Jakarta, but used wet-leased Wamos equipment. However, the entire experience was good. Clean and spacious plane with pleasant 2-4-2 configuration, so ideal if you are traveling with 2 people. The staff was professional and friendly. They carried out very thorough safety checks before departure and landing. The only real downside was the entertainment. Little choice and - that should really be different - no flash path information. Furthermore, only praise for Wamos. A Basic experience, on time and comfortable

### "Worst flight of my life"
Not Verified |  Worst flight of my life. It was supposed to be a TAP flight and instead we ended up with Wamos. Old plane falling apart. No entertainment. Cell phone charging sockets not working. I paid for a seat with more room and ended up with a small firm seat and an 8 hour flight to Brazil. Unfriendly onboard staff. Horrible food. More than an hour's delay in departure due to people who preferred to get off rather than spend 8 hours on that plane. Peggior volo della mia vita. Doveva essere un volo TAP ed invece ci siamo trovati con Wamos. Aereo vecchio che cadeva a pezzi. Nessun intrattenimento. Prese di ricarica cellulari non funzionanti. Ho pagato per un sedile con più spazio e mi son ritrovato con un sedile piccolo rigido e 8 ore di volo per il Brasile. Personale di bordo antipatico. Cibo orribile. Più di un'ora di ritardo in partenza a causa della gente che ha preferito scendere piuttosto che farsi 8 ore sul quel'aereo.

### "the service was horrible"
This review is for the return leg of my trip from Los Angeles to Medellin on an Avianca flight operated by Wamos Air. Specifically, the BOG to LAX portion of the return trip. The flight starts off well enough: you are warmly greeted and handed a card signed by two flight attendants (FA) with warm wishes, etc. From there, it only goes downhill. Service was very hit-and-miss, mostly miss. It's as if the FA's are trying to check off items on a list than actually provide service. Meal service took a very long time from start to finish considering the number of business class seats and the the number of FA's. No one came by to check on you, ie refill your drink or offer more bread, etc. The FA's already did it and checked it off their list, no need to do it again. If you are overlooked during meal service oh well, it's not on the checklist to make sure, oh well. During my flight, my AV system was broken. I pressed the call light to let a FA know, but no one responded. When a FA did respond the second time I pressed the call light, he said he would go reset the system, but never did. It got so bad that the flight attendant sitting next to me deadheading to LA had to flag a FA down to have my AV system finally reset. The first reset didn't seem to be working, but the FA never bothered to check back, so I had to flag a FA again to have the AV system reset. The FA just didn't really seem to care. They were happiest when they were all congregating in the galley, hiding behind the curtain. Getting back to the food, you are handed a menu at the beginning of the flight, but I am not sure why. during meal service, they ran out of my main course selection and my dessert selection. I would say it was bad luck, but on the flight to BOG, Wamos Air ran out of my appetizer selection and main course selection too. My advice is to sit as close to the front of the aircraft as possible since meal service starts at the front of the plane. Speaking of the plane, in addition to the multiple broken AV systems, the footrest on my chair was broken. So when the chair was fully extended position, it felt as if I was slowly sliding off since the chairs were not completely lie flat. The monitor was not adjustable, so if you are above a certain height, you just have to deal with the glare. The bathroom reeked and was never cleaned during the flight, must not have been on their checklist. Overall, the service was horrible, the airplane was in need of maintenance, and the food was mediocre. Definitely, not a business-class product, maybe premium economy if you use your imagination.

### "service was fantastic"
Not Verified |  I wanted to fly by Air NZ. After finding out the Perth route was now going to be flying with WAMOS Air, I researched. I nearly canceled with all the negative 2-star reviews. Wamos Air is the best airline I have ever flown, service was fantastic, and the seats comfortable. Everyone was given a blanket and pillow, the food good for airline food. You could get extra drinks and food if wanted, and periodically, they would come around with water. On return to Perth, it was the same. The plane was not dated. The lady next to me, on returning, was quite ill, and the cabin crew couldn't do enough for her. They even reseated me so I wouldn't be concerned and they could access that traveller in case of added complications.

### "I had a good flight"
Milan to New York. The airline I bought the ticket from went bankrupt and the first flights after bankruptcy, as mine, were operated by Wamos Air. Despite horrible reviews, the company is normal. Airplanes and services are just slightly inferior to those of other renowned companies such as Alitalia and American Airlines. I noticed that the blankets and perhaps also the meals had been provided by the other company, so I cannot really tell about the quality. However the crew was smiley and kind. Entertainment was sufficient, with about 30 movies to choose from. The toilets were as clean as those of major airlines. Nothing to complain about. I had a good flight.

### "one has to buy the food/drinks"
Chicago to Gatwick flight with Norwegian was operated by Wamos Air and was absolutely horrible. At the check-in that we couldn't complete online we had to wait forty minutes. One of the employees wasn't very focused and got confused with our luggage as well as the boarding passes/passports. We did not know one has to buy the food/drinks. All staff spoke a lot of Spanish and avoided the contact with the passengers as much as possible. One stewardess was so rude that even passengers next to us complained. You can only pay with credit card - no other paying method is available. The staff didn't distribute water for several hours and said that we had to go back and ask them. Earpods weren't included  and cost 3 Dollars a pack. The tv program didn't offer a wide range of programs and my touchscreen hardly reacted. I changed seat because the one I got first was even more uncomfortable.

### "worst flights I have been on"
Gatwick to Chicago. I have flown this airline twice now and these were the worst flights I have been on. I booked through Norwegian and the flights were operated by Wamos. I'll never make the mistake of ignoring that again. To begin with, the seats are massively uncomfortable. I wasn't expecting luxury, but I could actually feel how the plastic fit together through the seat cover on this flight. Additionally, the cost of food was $45, so I chose not to order food, opting instead to bring snacks on the plane. Both flights I took were transatlantic, so around 8-9 hours. If you had not paid for food, they would not allow you to have even water. actually saw the flight attendants laugh in other passengers' faces when they asked for a cup of water on an 8+ hour flight! One of these flights didn't even allow passengers a chance to purchase snacks or drinks, either. The gate agents weighed passengers carry-on baggage when they felt like it (in other words, arbitrarily), so some people with overweight luggage were allowed on regardless of weight, while others had to pay £80 to check their luggage at the gate. My flight from London to Chicago took off over 2 and a half hours late and nearly caused me to miss my next flight. The crew were in no rush to help passengers move quickly off the plane, even knowing that there were people with layovers who would now need to make connecting flights with drastically less time (including going through customs, awaiting baggage, transferring to domestic terminals, and going through security again.) I would rather pay a massive last-minute ticket price than ever ride with this airline again and if I ever find myself in a position to fly with them again, I would either spend the money for a different airline, or just stay home.

### "Would not recommend Wamos"
Denver to Gatwick. Wamos Air was used by Norwegian Air during my trip home to the UK in December. They contacted me by e mail informing me of this change. I was rather annoyed as I had flown Norwegian in the Summer as was very pleased with the service. I called Norwegian whose agent assured me it would be exactly the same service including my seat reservation and ordered vegetarian meal. The flight out from Denver was ok, despite my vegetarian meal being some inedible dried up pasta dish. Breakfast was a barely thawed hard bread mozzarella sandwich. There were no TV'S in the seats and one had to log on onto Wamos Air which I was not prepared to do as I only had Cellphone and did not want to use my batteries. In the return journey to Denver the flight was delayed by half an hour. In both directions I was placed in a middle seat not an aisle seat as booked. One lady was kind enough to swap with me. Fortunately on the way back the aisle seat next to me was vacant. By moving one seat over and informing the flight attendants I had done this, must have caused great confusion for them. I did not receive my vegetarian meal at all. I asked three times to various attendants which proved quite annoying to them regarding their passive aggressive facial expressions. Finally they told me they had run out of vegetarian hot lunches and brought me a cheese sandwich and a free beer, probably to appease me. I was not at all complaining at the time but their general attitude towards me was aloof and unfriendly. I went to the galley to ask for a cup of tea x interrupting three attendants happily chatting away in Spanish. I wondered why they could not have such cheery dispositions towards the passengers. One girl very much put out it appeared, gave me a cup of tea. The annoyance on her face was very apparent. I am shocked that a reputable good airline such as Norwegian would contract such a sub standard company to replace them. I paid my money and it was not that cheap for a service that made my journey uncomfortable and unfriendly. I have read other negative reviews of Wamos Air, so I am joining the throng of a large number number of very dissatisfied customers. Would not recommend Wamos to anyone. Grubby old plane hostile crew seemingly in a constant state of confusion.

### "The staff were so great"
Gatwick to Denver. I was placed on a Wamos flight by Norwegian, and almost cancelled due to all the terrible reviews, but I didn't find it that bad at all. We brought our own movies to watch, and our own food (which I normally do on a flight anyway as  I like healthy stuff). I've had worse legroom on other flights, and the staff were more friendly and helpful than many others I've known (and I fly a lot). The plane was pretty old, but perfectly functional. The staff were so great that I told them I'd write a review because I felt that the pasting they're getting online is unfair, and makes us travellers look rather spoilt to be honest.

### "probably the worst airline"
Paris to Los Angeles. My flight was originally supposed to be operated by Norwegian. They replaced their plane with one from Wamos at the last minuter. Everything you read on Wamos is true: probably the worst airline I have flown with. The only good thing I could say about them is that the plane was clean, and the staff was courteous (most of them). Everything else needs a red flag. No electric or USB plugs for your devices, no entertainment monitors: you have to use your own tablet or device by downloading their app before taking off and connecting to their network, which means if you don't have any of these devices or if you are an older person who has a hard time with the new tech, you're sidelined and have no movie for the whole flight (12 hours sitting in a tight seat doing nothing is a long time). Not even mentioning if your computer is not compatible with their app (that was my case). I had to watch their programs on my small iPhone. And the connectivity/functionality of their app is appalling: if you have to rewind even once, good luck! Now, regarding their entertainment program: 10 old movies, nothing else. I had seen most of them, and the ones I had not seen sucked. Finally, about a major matter on a plane: the food. Norwegian is a low-cost airline that makes it confusing by having to pre-order your meals when you book your ticket. But the thing is, it's kind of really not clear, and when you book your ticket, you tend to automatically assume that meals are included. I pre-ordered mine without knowing . But many people don't. The next available option is to purchase on the plane, but they only sell food to the other passengers way after they serve the pre-ordered meals, and it takes for ever, because of how many passengers are in that situation. I will never use your services again, unless I have no other choice!

### "no service whatsoever"
JFK- London (Wamos Air, operated for Norwegian). This was easily the worst experience I've ever had on an airplane, and I've been around the block for a while. Whilst the two hour delay can be excused, there was little understanding for the lack of any form of customer services. There were no screens/entertainment devices (which for an 8h flight is understandably frustrating) and no service whatsoever (as in, no food or drinks). When I asked for water for the 3rd time, I was supplied with a 1/4 cup of brown-ish water, that certainly did not taste right. The stewardesses did not provide any helpful services and spent most of the flight talking to each other. Most members of staff were rude and did not accommodate any of the request of my fellow travelers. Do not get me started on the airplane itself - the seats were as uncomfortable as they get, and small. The air conditioning did not work and it was stuffy and hot throughout the entire flight. Again, for an 8 hour flight that is just not bearable. I advise to not ever fly with Wamos Air
.

### "Seats so crowded"
Gatwick to New York on Wamos Air operated flight. Ancient airplane. Seats so crowded a fight literally broke out when a woman near me tried to recline her seat. Food was average. Staff was extremely young, badly trained. Older staff did better but were clearly stressed by passengers who were appalled at the lack of space. Video screens were also very old; many did not work and the ones that did showed only one old movie. No programming.

### "was the worst plane"
Not Verified |  This was the worst plane we ever flew on. Very little leg room with a fold up footrest that presents an injury hazard in up or down position even at low impact. Inflight entertainment non functional. Some toilets out of order, one with the toilet seat on the floor. We flew out 1 hour 45 minutes late with no explanation. We were put on this plane by Norwegian Air and we will not use Wamos or Norwegian again.

### "plane was old and it shows"
Paris CDG to Havana. I bought an Air France ticket but the plane was changed to Wamos Air. Their plane was old and it shows. Screens mostly not working. When they do they offer poor entertainment - only one film for the kids. On the flight back we didn't even have a reading lamp for a night flight, so we were mostly in the dark. I couldn't even see my meal, so I dropped wine on my clothes. The seat was not reclining. When we asked the staff for help, they shrugged "Sorry, this is an old plane. We can offer you a drink". The spanish staff speak very accented French and English that is hard to understand. The PA system was dysfunctional and basically inaudible. If your airline drops you on a Wamos air, be ready and download movies on your phone or tablet. And bring a spare battery as they have no outlet.

### "Worst flight of my life"
Madrid to Santo Domingo. This is the worst two flights I have ever experienced. I will never fly Wamos Air again. Disgusting food, no in flight entertainment on a nine hour flight, hardly any leg room. A drunken passenger drinking from a bottle of duty free spirits lurching around the cabin before take off was not removed from the flight and carried on his behaviour while we were taxiing and in the air, cabin crew not capable of stopping him, he eventually fell asleep in a drunken stupor. Worst flight of my life.

### "seats were spacy enough but old"
Madrid to Cancun with Wamos Air. Attendants at the gate were kind and let us choose which seats we wanted in the 3x4x3 configuration of the plane. The B747 was 22 years old and you could see it right away. The seats were spacy enough but old and my neighbors head support was broken. My seat had the inflight entertainment box in the foot space. The entertainment was awful (2 movies during a 10h flight, on a 6inch old and ugly black and white screen). Why putting entertainment if it is this poor? You could not unlock the controller because it was fixed to the arm rest. The service was just OK. Did not answer call buttons. You have to pay alchol beverages and the var was only offered 2 times. Some of the staff English skills were poor and I think that English for an airline attendant is a must. The lunch was average and the extras are a little expensive. At least, the flight was on-time. I expect much more from a tour company that will later bring you to a 5-star hotel.

### "announcements were rather faint"
Flying business class made all the difference (see outward flight review). Staff were no better, no worse in their attitude, i.e. very helpful, but they had more time to spend. There were also no queues for the loos at any time. However, one real problem was that the announcements were rather faint against the aircraft noise, particularly the English ones - more so than in Economy class. We can only understand slow, clear Spanish and struggled to stay informed at all. I never understood what the iPad was for, over and above the perfectly good screen, so I gave it back. The seat, screen etc worked perfectly and the extra storage room was so useful to have. The seat was very comfy as a normal seat, although my tray sloped badly to one side. Reclined all the way it was great for a while but then became excruciatingly uncomfortable as there's really no padding in places and hips dig in etc. I found it best to recline it only part way. The food was really very nice, with both the chicken and salmon being very tasty. And the champagne before take-off was a nice touch.

### "staff were courteous and helpful"
Wamos Air flight from Madrid to Cancun was on time and with no real problems. Staff were courteous and helpful though somewhat rushed at times so you had to be attentive to ensure they didn't pass you by. They were very good about keeping the loos clean and supplied. Our screen worked but some instructions would have been really useful. Everyone seemed to be spending more time trying to find out how things worked than actually using them, so it wasn't just us old fogies. Negatives all revolved around the seat and the food. The seats: We chose extra leg-room seats but there was actually less leg-room than normal as we faced a bulkhead - something that hadn't been clear from the picture. So, room for my tall husband's knees but absolutely no way to stretch out your legs for ten hours. The bulkhead really needs to have cutaway areas at the base. I'm sure that wouldn't be difficult to design in. The seat itself was very narrow. Even I, as a relatively slim woman, felt my hips were jammed in. The food: The pasta starter and the rice main course were both barely edible. Quite disgusting. However, the dessert and the snack were reasonable. We were pleased that water, tea and coffee were available in fairly copious amounts.
