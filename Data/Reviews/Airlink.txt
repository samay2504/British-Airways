### "R4000 for 2 bags to be checked in"
Not Verified |  The Durban-Harare route flight is completely a scam. The aircraft is very tiny and they charge luggage per kg. I was charged R130 per kg after exceeding the 20kg limit. This limit is for all your bags (all your bags should add up to 20kg) before the R130 per kg limit is applied. The ticket did not specify this, rather it said I am allowed 4 bags (20kg). Comparing to other flight tickets, this is very devious and deceitful. I was very unhappy and bitter paying R4000 for 2 bags that needed to be checked in. If this had been specified while buying the ticket I would have added another bag. Airlink is very disgusting.

### “Impressive and enjoyable journey”
Return journey. Clean, modern aircraft, comfortable seat, tasty food and drying and great cabin crew. On the way back ground staff checked our bags through to EDI on BA even though we did not have the journey on a single ticket. Impressive and enjoyable journey and I would happily use them again.

### "Awesome customer experience"
Had a missing baggage when landing at Victoria Falls. Airlink's staff was very helpful in tracing and rerouting this baggage to Nairobi, where I was when they traced the baggage. Awesome customer experience.

### "Airlink do so much right"
Airlink do so much right and so many other carriers in the region can learn from them. Reliably on time (91% on time across all their flights into Jo'burg for example), great convenient connections through OR Tambo, Johannesburg for regional Southern Africa departures onto domestic SA ones; generous baggage allowance (30kg per passenger from Lusaka to SA), ever smiling welcoming cabin crew and check-in staff (on 4 sectors without exception); coupled with tasty cold meals on intl sectors and good South African wines and juices on all really help them to stand out alongside now even a loyalty rewards program. Keep doing what you do Airlink - we are so grateful and you will be rewarded with custom.

### "two of our luggage’s were over 20kg"
My group of 6 checked in today but only 4 boarding passes were issued together with 2 payment requests for 3 kg excessive weight without telling us that two of our luggage’s were over 20kg or giving us a choice of removing some and putting them in the carry on bags. When we requested to do that the lady said the luggage’s already went inside and couldn’t be retrieved! No payment no boarding passes. Pathetic!

### "super impressed with this airline"
I was super impressed with this airline. Highly recommend it for travel within Africa. I'm not sure what else to say. Glad airlink is available now for travel in Africa.

### “pick Airlink at your own risk”
If you have another option of airline like Cemair or Fastjet pick those ones instead. Airlink left me at the terminal after I was scheduled to fly to Blantyre in May. Their boarding gates closed early and despite all my attempts to make it through immigration, they left me on the tarmac. The plane was scheduled to leave at 11:20, boarding gates were closed by 10:55am and the last bus gone. They only called me at 12:30pm to say very rudely come and get your luggage, knowing that I was left behind. If they could have called me to come and get my luggage, why did they not call me cause I was at the airport, checked in online at 8am, checked in a bag, and they still left me. It is because they don’t care, and now I will never get my R5000 back, lost ticket, lost time, lost gifts. When I emailed them to complain, they said they will get back to me after 2 months time. So pick Airlink at your own risk, I will never ever fly with them again, even if they go to the outer parts of Africa, I will rather take a bus or donkey and wagon.

### "Nice flight, on time"
Not Verified |   Nice flight, on time. Smooth check in. Nice cafe after formalities at Windhoek. Only minor complaint is that email ticket confirmation says you must print out that document which is 2 or 3 pages, so I did for 3 people. These 9 pages were NOT required at Windhoek check in.

### "cannot recommend this airline"
Not Verified |   It's unbelievable, I booked a flight at 12:35 from East London to Johannesburg as my onward flight is at 19:15. Now I realize that they simply set my flight to depart at 6:15 p.m.  A call to the hotline revealed that I should pay R1207 to rebook. I did not make this booking. Airlink claims there are no problems with the website, it's just strange that I'm not the only one who has the same problems. I cannot recommend this airline. It's better to book through Safair than through Airlink, this airline is a rip-off.Es ist unglaublich, ich habe einen Flug gebucht um 12:35 von East London nach Johannesburg da mein Weiterflug um 19:15 geht. Jetzt stelle ich fest das sie meinen Flug einfach auf 18:15 Abflug gesetzt haben. Ein Anruf auf der Hotline hat ergeben das ich R1207 zahlen soll für eine umbuchung. Ich habe diese Buchung zu nicht getätigt! Airkink behauptet es gibt keine Problememit der Websit, nur komisch das ich nicht der einzige bin der die selben Probleme hat. Ich kann diese Airline nicht empfehle. Bucht lieber über safair als über Airlink, diese Airline ist abzocke.

### “cabin crew was attentive and welcoming”
I recently had the opportunity to fly with Airlink South Africa for a short domestic flight. Although the itinerary was relatively brief, I was pleasantly surprised by the overall experience. The booking process was straightforward and user-friendly, without any unnecessary complications or hidden fees. I appreciated the option to check in online and generate a boarding pass, saving time and effort at the airport. The staff at the check-in counter was friendly and efficient, guiding me through the process with a smile. I was delighted to board an Embraer 190 jet, a spacious and comfortable aircraft known for its exceptional legroom and modern amenities. The cabin felt roomy and airy, providing ample space to stretch out and enjoy the journey. The cabin crew was attentive and welcoming, ensuring that passengers were comfortable and well-served. Before takeoff, they offered a selection of boxed juices and small snacks, a nice touch for such a short flight. The crew's friendly demeanor and genuine care for passenger satisfaction were commendable. Although Airlink's fares may be slightly higher than some budget airlines, the overall experience justifies the additional cost. The airline offers a combination of comfort, efficiency, and friendly service that makes it a worthwhile choice for travelers seeking a pleasant air travel experience. My recent Airlink flight left me with a positive impression. The airline's commitment to efficiency, comfort, and customer service is evident in every aspect of the journey. While it may not be the cheapest option, Airlink South Africa delivers a value proposition worth considering for those seeking a reliable and enjoyable flying experience.

### "lost a customer forever"
This was a connecting flight completing an overseas trip I had made to the USA; therefore, check in was performed at the desks at the international arrivals hall immediately after customs. I knew my check in luggage was slightly overweight (23 kg), but had already had been told by my travel agent that the flight was not looking like it was full. However, the check in lady informed me I was overweight, and I would have either reduce the contents of the suitcase or pay. After some 30 hours in the air, I was not about to do the former. She was completely implacable, and adopted a sarcastic attitude when I queried the severity of her decision - at that moment, I became angry, and left precipitously. The payment was only about R120, but was an irritation to get processed - the lady receiving payment was just as rude as the check-in clerk. In any event, the plane was less than half full, to the extent that the captain had to request people to move from the front to the back to obtain the correct balance. So, for the additional princely sum of R120, Airlink have lost a customer forever - there are competition airlines on this route.

### "Shame on you Airlink"
Our flight was rerouted to JNB due to bad weather in Bloemfontein. We arrived at or JNB at about 19h00. They had no idea how to handle the situation and didn't provide any information unless we insisted on it. Eventually we were taken to a hotel at 01h45 in the morning and had to be back at the airport by 04h30. Our flight was delayed again by 30min due to refueling even though we had to stay on the plane the night before because they were apparently refueling. I'm a frequent flyer on airlink and could never complain about their service, but this situation was totally unacceptable. Especially the disregard of children and the elderly. Shame on you Airlink

### "Cabin crew were friendly and helpful"
Plane was clean and tidy but starting to look its age, the flight took off on time and was uneventful. On board catering was provided with a sandwich and a drink. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Once landed, deboarding was quick however the baggage took an age to come through.

### "currently sitting in complete discomfort"
Absolutely pathetic service in flight. They do not check the sizes of what people carry. Booked an entire row of 3 seats, yet my overhead luggage compartment did not even have space for a R2 coin. No willingness to help from the hostess in fact, I was told if I continue to complain I will be removed from the flight. This air hostess creating an unnecessary issue was crew on flight leaving to DBN on 2nd November at 17:30 and needs to undergo training. Threatening to get taken out a flight just because you have the right to have your denominated luggage space. I am currently sitting in complete discomfort while another crew member apologizes on her behalf.

### "completely unprofessional"
Our flight was delayed due to a technical issue in Harare by about 7 hours so i missed my connecting Qantas flight. We were told by airlink staff in Harare that accommodation for the night and rebooking of flights was all sorted out. When we arrived airlink in Johannesburg were nothing short of rude and dismissive. After verbal shouting matches that almost got physical with staff that just told us to come back tomorrow and no accommodation we were left completely high and dry. Airlink SA i have never felt the need to write a review, not for anything ever, but your counter staff on the night of 10th October are not the people you want representing your company. If they are any reflection of the company itself you guys are in big trouble. I found a bed after the 5th hotel i tried at 2am in the morning, out of my own pocket. And was told i would have to buy another ticket to complete my journey and that they would not be able to help it that either. Fortunately just a single phone call to Qantas i was able to sort that side out. Airlink SA please contact me regarding this issue. Your service was nothing short of completely unprofessional.

### "everything wrong from start to finish"
Not Verified | Airlink is the only Airline that was late, lost my bag and had unfriendly staff, all in one flight. As for the lost bag they took 2 months to process my claim and come up with a 1 page document saying they cant be blamed for a missing bag. Guess it's unreasonable of me to expect my bag to arrive at my destination. Airlink has got it right in the past but to get everything wrong from start to finish in one flight is just scary.

### "I want to express my disgust"
Not Verified |  I want to express my disgust in an experience I had yesterday with your check in staff for flight 4Z178 from Johannesburg to Gaborone at 5pm yesterday afternoon. You had two young gentlemen doing the check in. on getting close to the counter the gent doing our ques was just taking forever. Where I was number 4 from the front and the other Queues must have checked in at least 25 people in the time my queues did one. I also stated that should there not be a business class check in ques and also asked what the hold is up. To which I was told I am busy. Thought that was a courteous answer for a starter and again I asked re the business class queues. Apparently there was no business class on this plane to which I responded that I booked business class. I could be wrong as I see on my message from my travel agent it sates business class however on the ticket I noticed afterwards that it shows economy. That is fine but the responses I was getting with the attitude and looks from now both guys doing the check in. The taller of the two asked me what seat I am in, and I stated 2D to which he responded that isn't even a business class seat. Once I got onto the plane to find my seat is a business class seat number. The two ladies on the plane were absolutely fantastic and had smiles and was friendly. How do you go from one extreme to the next. I suggest giving the two lads some proper training on customer service as well as manners.

### "small airline just as good as the big ones"
Not Verified | Wasn’t expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by the professionalism and friendliness of ground staff, cabin crew and pilot and co-pilot. Cabin was clean, all equipment worked, instructions were clear and to the point. We also returned to Port Elizabeth with Airlink and everything was just as good, showing it wasn’t a flash in the pan but rather their way of working. Very impressed a small airline that is just as good as the big ones.

### "Everything was just perfect"
I flew from Johannesburg to Cape Town return in June 2023. I was really blown away by the staff friendliness and was pleasantly surprised by the food and drinks fresh and delicious. Everything was just perfect.

### "Staff are super friendly"
Thank you Airlink for the amazing service and comfortable flight. Staff are super friendly. This is my first time flying with Airlink and ii recommend that everyone flying should use Airlink!

### "the best domestic flight I have had"
Not Verified |  I travel quite a bit every year to Europe and USA. I must say this is the best domestic flight I have had in many years. Airlink is good they offered me Lunch plus a good red wine. Excellent. I hope they become the no.1 Airline in SA.

### "feeling well looked after"
On boarding the aeroplane, the air hostess was polite and friendly. The cabin was small but it is to be expected. Both hostesses were impeccably dressed with neat hairstyles. The sound system relaying messages was clear and the hostess was well spoken. The meal of a healthy beef bun was well packaged and fresh and tasty. The sparkling water beverages too were cold and the tea was hot. The overall experience was one of feeling well looked after, treated with respect and definitely boarding an Airlink flight soon again.

### "Comfortable and on-time"
Comfortable and on-time service with a super friendly and welcoming crew for my first flight on this airline. Even the pilots took time to engage with my 3 children, would not hesitate to recommend and fly Airlink again when back in the region.

### "terrible customer service"
Airlink is a terrible and not reliable airline, I came from Frankfurt and connected with Airlink to Maputo, one of my baggage never arrived and Airlink was the airline responsable to make the follow ups and find my baggage. First their response is bad, terrible customer service, they do not give updates to client and I had to make several calls to their office in Maputo to follow up on my process, after 4 months of process they decided on my claim and only paid me back for the items I could keep the original receipts (which where only two pairs of shoes), I explained that I do not keep receipts since I never though that would be necessary to claim for a lost bag and most of the reputable international airline companies pay by Kgs in this kind of situation. This airline does not value their clients and does not help in case of need. I strongly advise you to not use this airline if possible, they will lose your bag and not adequately reimburse you for the value of your items.

### "customer service skills were fantastic"
Not Verified |  Eric Scholts customer service agent deserves a medal. I was travelling from Windhoek to Johannesburg with a group of 25 people. We had a connecting flight to Paris with a 3 hour lay over and my checked back was set to stop in Johannesburg, instead of continuing to Paris (causing the potential risk of missing my flight). Thankfully, I was able get assistance from Eric, who escorted me through an airport I’ve never been to before, to ensure I made my next flight on time. He explained each of the checkpoints I had to go through to get to my gate. His communication and customer service skills were fantastic. I had trouble through Airlink with my itinerary the night prior but I’m grateful I was able to get assistance. This man gets a 10/10, but the airline overall with the troubles I had the day prior get a 6/10, so overall 8/10.

### "I appreciate high quality treatment"
I am 94 years old and requested wheelchair-assistance, which was granted. I would like to thank all personnel for helpfulness and friendliness throughout flight and arrival in Cape Town. Assistance with luggage retrieval and safe delivery to family. I appreciate high quality treatment.

### "crew friendly and efficient"
Airlink is an up and coming airline in Southern Africa that has been expanding. Surprisingly, its service is very good and quite friendly. My flight was a Sunday evening flight and a relatively short one of about 1 hour and 10 minutes. Those of us in business class were called to board first. Boarding was accomplished by a walk across the tarmac to the plane as it appears the jetways at Maputo airport are not operable. Passengers were seated quickly on this mostly full flight and take off was prompt. What was pleasantly surprising is that en route, we were served with a good light dinner that solved my issue with where to eat after arrival. The seat was comfortable and I was seated in a window seat on the left side of the aisle. Restrooms were clean and appropriately stocked. Service by cabin staff was efficient and friendly and we arrived in Johannesburg about 15 minutes after the meal service. I am quite happy with the service of Airlink as this is the 4th time I have flown with them. Their aircraft are nicely maintained, the crew is friendly and efficient, and they are increasingly spreading their wings through southern Africa. I am comfortable in recommending Airlink.

### "would use this airline again"
Not Verified |  We had two flights with is airline Johannesburg to Hoedspruit and skukuza to Johannesburg. We were a bit concerned. If we go back to South Africa we would use this airline again.

### "great service, great airline"
First time using Airlink, check in very quick from a pleasant check-in agent. Security quick boarding was via a bus which is expected in this small aircraft, carry on bags also placed in the hold before boarding. Departed on time for this short 40 min flight, the service on this short flight carried out by 1 cabin crew was just great. Seat A1 so had the chance to chat to the stewardess who was very professional, comfortable seat a sandwich and coffee served before our decent to George. I normally drive this trip - not anymore great service great airline.

### "quality of meals was pretty good"
We took off on time and arrived about 15 minutes early. Ground staff and cabin staff were very friendly and helpful. The advertised aircraft was an Embraer E190 but they change to an E170 allowed a look at the model which I had not flown in before. The cabin had to be sprayed before take-off at Harare while we were seated and the smell was a bit overwhelming. That aside, the punctuality and quality of meals was pretty good. The selection of beverages was very good for economy class.

### "be avoiding at all costs in future"
Bags delayed twice with no compensation or report. Our bags were delayed by 26 hours on our outward journey, meaning that we had no clothes / toiletries for our first day and night. We had to purchase emergency clothes and toiletries as a result. Our bags were again delayed on our return journey by 36 hours - although as this was the home journey we incurred no additional costs. Airlink refuses to reimburse costs over ZAR 350 per day. I had purchased insurance to cover any additional costs, but I need a Property Irregularity Report for my insurer. Airlink is not responding to my emails, and is not issuing a PIR despite many emails chasing. Useless airline and I will be avoiding at all costs in future. The flights weren't even that cheap.

### "wouldn't fly this airline again"
There was a single person manning the counters at check-in. My bags were overweight so was directed to another counter to pay for the excess which is no issue. But that took 20 mins as they kept allowing other customers in front of the line. In flight food was a joke. Now have been waiting at the baggage conveyor for over 30 mins and no bags have come out. I expect this is due to the fact we arrived earlier than scheduled and were redirected to a parking bay other than the one designated for us and therefore assume this has caused some confusion and delay with the luggage being off loaded and reclaimed. I wouldn't fly this airline again to be honest.

### "definitely recommend Airlink"
Short flight but excellent service and excellent airline. Staff are really helpful and go the extra mile to help disabled passengers. I will definitely recommend Airlink.

### "have forfeited my flight"
I booked a ticket from Cape Town to Kimberley and made sure the ticket can be changed. At 14:36 I called the head office as I was struggling to check in online and my flight was for 15:25. I was informed that the online check in have closed, but I should at least be by the airport at 15:00. I informed the lady that I might be there around 14:58. I was assured that if I at least be there by 15:00 I would still be allowed to check in. I arrived at the counter at 14:59 and the lady tried checking me in and called and called another person to hear how she should go about. at 15:10 I was informed to go to ticket sales where I can change this flight to the next flight. Upon arrival at the ticket sales, I was informed that I have missed check in with 4 minutes and therefore have forfeited my flight and need to purchase a new ticket. If the lady on the line from airlink head office would have told me that I need to be the check in by 14:55 I would have requested to move this flight to the next. However, I was informed that 15:00 would still be all good. I have the entire conversation on recording and demand a full refund or a free flight to Kimberley for this miss information. I can you forfeit an entire flight for being 4 min late and yet nobody has boarded yet.

### "Can't trust their transfer service"
Domestic transfer lost luggage during my flight via Johannesburg. Despite the bag clearly tagged and marked for transfer to Cape Town, it was the only bag left behind. Once they did manage to trace it, Johannesburg baggage office had no knowledge of it having been there and Cape Town didn't answer phone lines. Several calls later they finally said its now in Cape Town and asked me what happened. Once they delivered the bag to my home the zip was open while the bag was still locked. No reasons provided by the airline on why it was lost or zip was open. Can't trust their transfer service, yet I have to travel with them for work.

### "staff was so unnecessarily rude"
From the baggage check in, the boarding gates and the flight itself, the staff was so unnecessarily rude. My family and I were last at the gate with 15 minutes to spare before boarding would close, and yet we were met with rude looks and very obvious irritation. I tried to greet the lady and she intentionally ignored me. On the flight two of the flight attendants gave us nothing but attitude and made us feel like we were making their lives difficult when we didn’t ask for anything. The staff desperately need to be trained in customer politeness, otherwise they should not choose such a client-facing career. Everyone is stressed at the airport, a little kindness can go a long way. They acted like bratty teenagers.

### "flying can be an enjoyable experience"
Airlink is a high quality airline. I am content with their service and cannot find any fault in them. Used them on a round trip from Namibia to South Africa. The first scene which stood out to me was viewing the plane in real life with the sunbird logo. The food packaging is divine. They had a real life high quality glossy sunbird image on them. First flight I received the “Scarlet-chested Sunbird”. Second time was the “Double-Collared Sunbird.” The birds are admirable in their colourful feathers and exotic designs. For the menu they began by serving a drink, followed by a sub-lunch with the option of coffee or tea. A few minutes later, air hostesses came around offering a drink one last time before the plane’s descent. I am glad they added coffee or tea to the sub-lunch as the lunch alone is not very filling. My first sub-lunch consisted of: rolled smoked turkey slices, creamy honey mustard pasta shells, butternut and feta salad. For dessert, which was my favourite delicacy of the sub-lunch, was the custard and jelly topped with white and brown chocolate shavings. Not sure whether that’s what it actually is, however that is how I would describe it. Final part of dessert is a gourmet fudge which was over sweetened in my opinion. I have a sweet tooth, however this treat was too sweet. My second sub-lunch, I forgot to capture the menu of the second sub-lunch, however I did snap a picture of the food so here’s me writing the meal in my own words: rice, baloney style beef and corn salad. Dessert was the same as the first meal. Food tasted delicious. I appreciate the sub-lunch not being too heavy. Plus the flight is short-lived, therefore a heavy meal is not necessary. To add, they have Schweppes lemonade on board. The refresher towel which came along the sub-lunch was useful in sanitising my hands and dining tray. The Embraer-190 is small but durable. Return trip I booked a window seat with grand views. It was fascinating viewing the outline of South Africa colliding with the massive blue waters of the Atlantic Ocean, with all the shaping exactly how it’s portrayed in the maps. When flying over Windhoek I gazed through my window and was blown away by the 42 000 feet view of Windhoek’s terrains. Below me was a collection of mountains and shrubs. Airlink is gentle with luggage and cabin crew is polite and hospitable. A free copy of Airlink’s in-flight magazine in the front pocket. There is no in flight entertainment, which is understandable since the flight was short lived. It is worth mentioning if you intend to tag a suitcase along as hand luggage, they will collect it pre-flight and you shall receive it on arrival since the overhead cabins cannot accommodate larger suitcases. Airlink reminded me flying can be an enjoyable experience.

### "Nice crew, pleasant flight"
Very professional and friendly, helpful check-in staff. Flight left Cape Town on time, was amazed that a free dinner (no, NOT a stale sandwich!) and a drink were served (flying time 1:33 hours). Nice crew, pleasant flight, luggage arrived fast in Jo'burg.

### "a decent regional airline"
Airlink are a decent regional airline and the staff are pleasant and competent. If you’re travelling in business class on the E190 I’d go for row 2 You get extra leg room or storage space under the seat in front. You can recline the seat without encroaching on the person behind you. The seat has 2 windows albeit slightly misaligned compared to row 1 which only has 1 window. Reasonable snack and a drink. Check in was quick in Windhoek. Downsides no lounge at Windhoek. Buses in departure and arrival with no special transport for C class. Appalling baggage retrieval time at OR Tambo but I don’t know if that’s the airline or the airport.

### "such a horrible experience"
Johannesburg to Bloemfontein. I have the worst experience that I have ever had in my life flying any airline. I have been in the same clothes since 4am this morning because of airline's negligence. We have been calling the whole day, we were lied to and told my bag that was offloaded because I was a no show even though I flew on flight that I was booked on. The lady I spoke to in the morning said after she made enquiries, my bag would be on next flight to Bloem that was at 9:20am and would be dropped off at the hotel by 11am, she would contact me. When I realised she had called, we called to check, told another story. I am still being told stories even now, I am filthy, have no luggage, have nothing to wear for the meetings I came for. This is the worst service I have ever gone through and he fact that nobody cares. Only one person tried to be helpful, but poor guy couldn't do anything because he was not where my bag was. Oh my God, this is such a horrible experience.

### "This service must be improved"
Not Verified |  We transported our pet via Petlounge. Airlink firstly charges double what Comair used to charge and they keep the pet for more than 7 hours. That’s 3 hours before the flight, 2 hour flight time and another 2 hours to deliver the pet to Petlounge. This ‘timing’ is inhumane to any animal. Any human being would not be closed up in a steel box for 7 hours! This service must be improved!

### "Very clean, nice staff, on time"
Very clean, nice staff, on time. If I will compare this airline to European/American 4 star airlines Airlink is much better every way. On such short journey as Johannesburg to Cape Town you will receive a complimentary food, you have checked baggage in price of your standard ticket, you will fly with Embraer with two-two configuration with very friendly and helpful staff (also on-ground). I do recommend.

### "great service and flight"
Not Verified |  Johannesburg to George. Thanks for great service and flight. Will definitely use AirLink again. Great lunch and drinks included and friendly staff.

### "experience was very nice indeed"
Windhoek to Cape Town. Unlike the unfortunate passengers from previous reviews, my experience with Airlink was very nice indeed. We left Windhoek on time, arrived at Cape Town 20 minutes early, great! The windy Windhoek lived up to its name, so that the take-off was quite bumpy - as the captain warned us, so we were prepared, but once we left the cloudy area things got much better and calmer. On that short flight we got excellent service - wine, coffee, and light cold lunch which was actually delicious and nothing on that tray was there without a reason. The luggage was on the carousel faster than we got to it, and it was all over a very pleasant experience, thank you.

### "I would never recommend Airlink if you are on crutches"
Not Verified |  I would never recommend Airlink if you are on crutches, walking stick or heaven forbid a wheelchair (they would probably take it from you and make you crawl), as the experience my father went through was pure hell and his already injured leg was in excruciating pain after his flight. When my father arrived at the Cape Town airport he asked for his one crutch to be put in the hold as using both on the plane is very difficult, they staff proceeded to tell him he would have to get it checked as abnormal and made him walk across the airport with no assistance, I wouldn't think trying to help someone on crutches that is in pain would be such a hassle. My sister requested my father to be put in a seat where he could stretch out his leg as it pain horribly when he sits for to long, but no they said to her of course and proceeded to put him somewhere where his leg was crushed thank heavens a kind man offered to swap seats so my father's leg could stretch out no help from the air crew though. When he landed this side I picked him up and the crutch that was put into the hold was stuck into the smallest setting, and it was so stuck I even tried to ask the one airport worker if they could help he could not even get it lose thankfully my uncle was able to use his vice to fix the crutch so my father could again use both instead of the one crutch as he only uses one crutch for short times as using only one hurts his leg far to much. My sister complained to Airlink after his flight about all of this and all they said is they offered a crutch and he refused which he did not as he would have loved a wheelchair as he was in immense pain due to all of this. AirLink obviously looks down on the disabled and when sia personally complains they blame it all on the disabled person, this blatant ableism is sickening I always thought basic compassion and some hint of humanity would win out to help someone who is struggling and in pain but I was horribly wrong.

### "The airline refused to refund"
Not Verified |  Terrible experience with this airline. Beware! Our tickets got placed on hold due to Omicron/Covid. The airline refused to refund and are basically requesting the same amount of which I already paid to use the tickets. So they want me to pay double the price per tickets. Customer care is unhelpful and full of excuses just to take clients money.

### "it was a very pleasant experiences"
Not Verified |  I really enjoyed my flight. The flight attendant was so lovely, very friendly and helpful. The flight was a breeze, a bit of a rocky landing, but in all it was a very pleasant experiences. I flew early in the morning, the breakfast snack I had, the sliders were so delicious!! Thank you Airlink, you never disappoint.

### "no updates for stranded passengers"
Unreliable flight information, no updates for stranded passengers. They treated the delayed flight like nothing. Random swap of aircraft, random breakdown of ferry buses, random announcement with nothing useful from the microphone. The only thing certain is, as a passenger, you will definitely get stranded and have your holiday plan ruined by Airlink.

### "frustrating to deal with"
Not Verified | Johannesburg to Hoedspruit. My wife was diagnosed with cancer and required urgent surgery so we needed to cancel our 2 internal flights which came to a total of £420 [ZAR8400]. I emailed Airlink customer services and they told me they required proof which was understandable. I forwarded them a letter from the hospital confirming her admission, a letter from the surgeon explaining that surgery was required urgently and that travel was not possible, but they said that this was not adequate information provided and that we would not qualify for a refund. I was so shocked by their replies, was made to feel like a liar, when we had more serious things to deal with. Would strongly avoid Airlink as they are non-sympathetic, poor customer service, and frustrating to deal with.

### "No sympathy for a customer"
No sympathy for a customer at all. I flew from Durban to Johannesburg had a layover of 2h 15mins before flying to Angola. I had a negative covid results from a government clinic, had sma confirming my results, only to be told that was not allowed. I had to call the lab to send me one with a QR code. While we were waiting for results, the boarding pass closed. Later i asked if they can assist they told me i was supposed to change dates an hour before, but they never suggested that to me, then when i emailed them later, they told me the staff suggested i change the dates and I refused. I did admit I didn't know that covid results wasn't allowed, as at clinic they assured me it was ok. Customer care is worse. I wouldn't suggest anyone to fly with this airline.

### "state that they allow one free date change"
On their website they state that they allow one free date change due to covid. I reached out to them 8 days prior to my flight to make the change (since my previous flight was changed too) and they initially confirmed that I can do so for free, just pay the difference in fare. When I accepted it and asked them to proceed with the payment they went completely silent. No response to my emails that I sent daily. No one answered phone calls! 36 hours prior to my flight I made the change myself, paid outrageous difference since the flight was so close and also paid the penalty fee. Reached out to Airlink and asked for the refund, and  they did not reply again!

### "could do a lot better to assist passengers"
Not Verified | What a mission it was to get hold of Airlink to change our tickets! Due to testing positive for Covid, our travelling plans had to change drastically. I held the line for Customer Service for 40 minutes until a rude lady picked up on the other end, sighing with every question I had. Then came the public holiday so we couldn’t make any name changes or add a minor by ourselves on the website. Luckily I got hold of a very friendly lady the next day to help add a minor, but I still had to send an email for the name change. I phoned Customer Care on Friday at 15:50 and by 16:30 I got cut off. Still no reply to my email (with the address given as the emergency contact). It is the weekend now and Customer Care is closed. How could this be? With Covid we have learned that anything could change any minute, what should a passenger do if they have to change their flight details? Get on the flight even though they have Covid just because they couldn’t change everything on the website and don’t want to loose their money? Come on, Airlink, you could do a lot better to assist passengers affected by Covid.

### "overall this was a nightmare"
Understaffed and poor internal communications - lost essential baggage for a short business trip. I recently made a business trip to Cape Town for a conference. One of my bags therefore contained marketing material (rollup banners). I checked these bags in in Maputo, they were treated as normal hold baggage. I was advised that I needed to collect the bags in person at Johannesburg airport and re-check them in for the leg to Cape Town. Upon arrival at Johannesburg, the bag containing the banners did not appear - either at the carousel or the fragile/oversized baggage counter. When I attempted to make a baggage claim, the SA Airlink baggage claim desk was unstaffed. I therefore had to pass through customs and look for another desk. The transit desk was also unstaffed. I reached the main ticket office, which was fully staffed, however the staff there would not assist me, and sent me to a check in counter. The staff at the check in counter tried to phone their colleagues in the baggage team, however there was no answer. As my connecting flight was due to board, the staff member advised me to rush through security in order to reach the boarding gate. She promised to try to find the bag. I asked her for my claim number, however she stated that I should send an email to report my claim. I asked her why she herself could not send an email, at which point she stated that she could not help me further, since she did not have a computer. As I boarded the flight I asked the gate staff if my bag had been found but she was not interested and just wanted to get people on board. Upon arrival in Cape Town, again I tried to contact SA Airlink staff to discover if the bag had been found, however there were no SA Airlink staff in the whole airport. Upon arrival at my hotel I received a call that the bag had been found in Johannesburg, and was probably at Cape Town airport. However there were no staff there to confirm. I was given a number to call early the next morning. I called it multiple times, however it never answered. Late in the morning I got through to a number in Johannesburg, where a staff member admitted that they were having difficulty contacting the Cape Town airport branch and promised to call me back. On this day, I had to attend the conference at which I needed to display the banners. I ended up having to get alternative (inferior quality) banners printed up in Cape Town, in order to use at the conference. SA Airlink only confirmed that the banners had been found, at the end of the day, when it was too late to be of use. Despite the fact that some of the HQ staff I spoke to were pleasant and seemed to be trying to help, overall this was a nightmare. Two things became clear: a) SA Airlink save money by not having a full complement of staff at the airports - this means that there is no one to assist the passenger in case of problems b) The ground staff appear to be very unhappy and disgruntled, if you have any problem at all they just "don't want to hear about it". The aircraft itself was clean and the onboard snacks were OK, and the flights left nearly on time. So really this airline's weak point is lack of ground staff, poor attitude of ground staff, and poor internal communications.

### "really nice flight"
Johannesburg to Cape Town. What a really nice flight. Very comfortable seats, on time and very pleasant crew. As a South African taxpayer, I'm so glad I'm not having to pay twice for the same trip as is the way with state owned airlines here. Keep up the good work Airlink.

### "Worst service today"
Not Verified |  Worst service today, booked flight for a unaccompanied minor (10 years old), arrived at OR Tambo 2hours before checkin, had all the necessary documentation but was delayed by the airline staff to fill health questionnaires, my brother was then checked in but left by the flight and they did not bother to communicate as to what transpired instead they are saying we arrived late and should have been at the airport 3hours before.

### "a relaxing pleasant experience"
What a lovely experience! I hope I can use Airlink all the time. Everything from reservation, online check in, bag drop, boarding, punctuality and the friendly professional service on board made the whole journey a relaxing pleasant experience. The covid-19 protocol was very good - ensuring social distancing. The seats are very comfortable and my husband who sat next to me had enough leg room. The only downside [for me with limited financial means] was the price of the ticket, but it was such a treat to use Airlink that I will start saving just to be able to use them again.

### "forced them to buy new tickets"
I had to change my children’s ticket because of changing COVID gov changed regulations and then when they were due to fly I had to change the tickets again as riots broke out in South Africa. South African Airlink profited from the above by forcing us to pay for new tickets. Then when an international airline had a late arrival and my children missed the Aairlink domestic flight, Airlink forced them to buy new tickets.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Avoid at all costs. If flying with Airlink, this airline does not communicate with its customers so beware of gate changes, and boarding time changes. They have terrible customer service and rude / unprofessional employees at their gates and flights. Speaking to their "marketing and customer relations officer" was like speaking to a machine reading hidden policies.

### "I would like to compliment Airlink"
Not Verified |  I would like to compliment Airlink on their service and professional reservations assistance for our flights to Skukuza from CT and back from Hoedspruit. They assisted with a cancellation in a professional and efficient manner as well as my daughter had to cancel a flight last minute due to Durban looting and riots. Their COVID Protocols as well as service, reliability, no delays etc. were great especially in a time when airlines have become unreliable due to the economic climate.

### "a pleasure dealing with him"
Not Verified |  Had a flight booked for April 2020 and then Covid-19 lockdowns prevented us all from travelling. Seven months later Musi helped us change dates and Airport for later this year. He was so helpful and professional and organised. It was a pleasure dealing with him. Thank you for taking care of your customers through this tough time. We look forward to flying and supporting and will both be booking another two one way tickets - so will be continuing our support. Wishing you and the staff all the best until the international tourists return. Thank you and well done.

### "Very pleasant experience"
Johannesburg to Walvis Bay. Very pleasant experience with good service and comfort on board. Seats in business class are very comfortable and allow a lot of legroom in the first two rows. Boarding process in Johannesburg was a bit chaotic due to the ground staff and no bus being available.

### "professional and experienced"
Not Verified | Johannesburg to Gaborone. There is a noticeable difference with this airline, more attention is given to safety and communicating to clients. Very efficient, the aircraft was stunning and we arrived early. Overall the team seemed more professional and experienced.

### "supposedly faulty passport"
Maun to Cape Town. Never use this airline. Denied boarding because of a supposedly faulty passport. Forced to buy connecting ticket out of Cape Town, forced to leave my family and not join them on vacation. On arrival in Cape Town authorities did not find an issue with passport. The price for a ticket was already high and now the additional flight out of Cape Town that I did not use cost me another 700 dollars

### "nice fleet of planes2
Every time I flew with Airlink (From Pietermaritzburg), everything was fantastic. Their boarding procedure, legroom, seat width are good. They have a nice fleet of planes, currently: the Embraer E190/170, Embraer 135, Avro RJ85 and Jetstream J41 (Avoid). The Avro RJ85 is comfortable but slightly cramped (I'm 1.8m tall). The Embraer E190 is fairly new and very spacious. They serve a snack and free beverages on these short flights.The only downside is that they are relatively expensive when compared to low cost carriers.

### "aircraft was clean and comfortable"
Durban to George with Airlink. The Embraer aircraft was clean and comfortable. The air hostess was friendly. On the 1 hour 45 minute flight we were served a chicken wrap which was good. Even on our 45 minute flight from George to Cape Town we were served a cheese sandwich. However Airlink are fussy with luggage. They only permit 20 kilos; not 23 like on larger aircraft. Fortunately South African weighed our bags in Durban and made no comments. However in George Airlink do the check in and were charged excess luggage fees. But for 7 kilos over we paid only 15 US dollars. Our flights left and arrived on time. Fares on this airline though are relatively expensive.

### "professional and all smiles"
Kasane to Johanesburg. Boarding with 15 minutes late due to late inbound. It was a full flight,once boarded and after we had taken off, the flight attendant came through with the trolley and offered a chicken sandwich. The sandwich was tasty. We hit quite a bit of turbulence once through it the flight attendant continued the service. The flight attendant was quite professional and all smiles.

### "luggage had not been loaded"
This was my first time flying Airlink. The flight was fine and food, seats and service were all quite good. However we (along with 11 other people ) were quite shocked when we reached Madagascar to learn that our luggage had not been loaded onto the plane. We had given our luggage in at JNB terminal 4 hours before the flight. We were also told that Airlink has no responsibility to get you your luggage in Madagascar after your arrival, necessitating a second trip to the airport on a subsequent day. For an airline to lose 12 people's luggage (out of 80 passengers) on a non-stop flight is unacceptable. We were told by someone else who regularly flies on this flight (she lives in Madagascar) that her luggage has also been lost on prior flights. A more minor but still very annoying practice of this airline is not to carry the visa form that must be filled out before entering Madagascar. The Air France flight that arrived at about the same time had these forms for its passengers.

### "attendants were efficient"
Johannesburg to Bulawayo in Zimbabwe on SA Airlink. Seats were comfortable and a meal was served flight together with drinks on this 1 hour 20 minute flight. Flight attendants were efficient and pleasant. This was a very nice trip.

### "satisfied flying with Airlink"
Airlink from Kimberley to Cape Town, a 1h30 flight. Leather black seats with enough legroom and nice cabin interior. The were lack of space meant I had to put my tripod and a great part of my hand luggage with the cabin crew luggage. The plane itself only has luggage compartments on the one side. We were served drinks and a choice of beef or chicken sandwiches. It was a pity they chose cheap instant coffee as the genuine substitute. We departed ahead of schedule and arrived 22 minutes ahead at Cape Town. We had only one crew member who served well. All in all, when you pay near nothing (R850 is about USD $65) and get so much - a meal, drinks, good seats and ground crew you have to be mad not to realise the value. It goes without question that this is just a very ordinary route with nothing special going for it, yet it has enough to lure me in. I was satisfied flying with Airlink.
