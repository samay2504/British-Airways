### "Ticket prices are unbeatable"
Volotea has become in my opinion the top economy airline. The staff are friendly and efficient, aircraft are spacious and clean. Ticket prices are unbeatable. I would recommend them. It saddens me that at the end of this month, they are stopping their charter flights from Heraklion to Athens.

It is very pleasant to fly with Volotea. Boarding is done well in advance which allows you to be on time for take-off. I travel regularly with this company and it is always a pleasure.

### "experience has been good"
The flight experience has been good, agile boarding and good explanations from the pilot of the weather conditions. The collection of the suitcases, very fast. I am a user of the megavolotea program and I am very satisfied. Hopefully they put more international routes or connections with other routes so I don't have to go to Madrid.

Very nice staff, we arrived earlier than expected. The aircraft was very clean, not cold as sometimes and it was new and comfortable.

### "I am generally satisfied"
I am generally satisfied with Volotea. The welcome is pleasant. The comfort of the seat and the legroom are correct for the proposed journey times. All of the options included in the subscription are satisfactory. I would just put a downside on the difference in plane ticket prices between subscription and non-subscription. And downside on the prices which completely break the figure or on the contrary are times 10 when you buy them at the last minute, no rule, it's confusing! Je suis satisfaite de Volotea d'une manière générale. L'accueil est plutôt agréable. Le confort de l'assise et la place des jambes sont très correctes pour les temps de trajet proposés. Rarement du retard dans les vols. L'ensemble des options incluses dans l'abonnement sont satisfaisantes. Je mettrai juste un bémol sur la différence de tarif du billet d'avion entre abonnement et pas abonnement. Et bémol sur les prix qui se cassent complètement la figure ou au contraire font fois 10 quand on les achète à la dernière minute, pas de règle, c'est déroutant ! ! !

Good service. We arrived and departure on time, with no problems. Cabin crew was very kind and efficient. I only have good words for this flight.

Il rapporto qualità prezzo molto buono se si viaggi nei periodi non di punta (festività, ponti etc.). - Always on time with easy, although improvable, boarding methods. The space between the seats is always sufficient, unlike other budget airlines. The value for money is very good if you travel during off-peak periods (holidays, long weekends, etc. ).

Easy checkin both in Strasbourg and Marseille. I had the chance to be seated in the first row of the aircraft and could therefore extend my legs, which is my usual problem during flights. Nice and friendly staff and smooth flight.

### “Friendly staff”
Friendly staff, schedules respected and very affordable prices. I had to go to Alsace several times for a death in my family, I am lucky that there is a direct line between Toulouse and Strasbourg thanks to this company.

Partenza in orario così come l'arrivo all' aeroporto di Olbia - Good flight, fast boarding and disembarking procedures, clean plane, efficient and kind staff. Departure on time as well as arrival at Olbia airport

### “snacks on board are disgusting”
Very punctual and efficient upon checking in. Very smooth process all along: no queueing at check in, easy Check in, fast boarding and did arrive before expected time. My only complaint: the available snacks to be purchased on board are absolutely disgusting: terrible quality hummus, very unhealthy dry sausage full of preservatives and bad for you additive and coloring, non descript bread sticks: this miserable selection sends a disastrous message about Spain: we do not care about you, we are cheap, we manufacture only unhealthy processed food, etc. Terrible. When we had all the extra costs with Volotea (basic fare, megavolotea membership, the extra cost to check in a 20 kg luggage and possibly buy junk food on board, it all adds up and I am not certain it is competitive. We love the selection of all the destinations from Nantes to Italy with Volotea.

### “everything is simple”
With Volotea everything is simple: the app works very well (as well as the website), prices are clear and it is easy to compare the rates on different dates. Simple to purchase, simple web check in (which allows you to transfer the boarding pass to the wallet, something that other companies, even more famous, are still unable to do). Even more importantly, in my experience, the flights are very punctual (some always early) and the staff is truly courteous and helpful. Volotea's success is truly deserved, let's hope they continue like this.

### "pleasant flight on time"
This is the 3rd time I have travelled with Volotea on this Caen-Montpellier route (from 7 to 10 February 2025) The flights are operated on A320s. The Volotea teams on the ground and in flight are very attentive to the quality of passenger care (anecdote: a person had forgotten her scarf at airport control, a Volotea team member came to bring it back to her directly on the plane), everything went very well, pleasant flight on time and arrived 15 minutes early on the return. I subscribed to the "Megavolotea" loyalty program (for €69.99 per year), this allows me to save more than 30% on my trips and it is valid for 5 people per flight, yourself and 4 companions (discounts on flights, seats, luggage, etc. ): to take if you travel frequently with Volotea. When booking on the Volotea mobile app, I was able to book a car at Montpellier airport with a 10% discount and the additional insurance with excess repurchase is cheaper than buying it directly from the rental company.

### “totally satisfied with the company”
Prise en charge parfaite aux différents aéroports pour notre dernier séjour, respect des horaires, Café offert pendant les vols et accès prioritaire entre autres avec la carte Mégavolotéa+, totalement satisfait de la compagnie depuis plusieurs années et plusieurs fois par an et pour nous au départ de Nantes. - Perfect support at the different airports for our last stay, respect of schedules, free coffee during flights and priority access among others with the Mégavolotéa+ card, totally satisfied with the company for several years and several times a year and for us departing from Nantes.

Very good low cost company punctuality. Very friendly cabin crew. I use Volotoa frequently and I am satisfied. I use the loyalty program which is very good, with priority boarding and cabin baggage with us.

### "chaos in boarding"
Punctual, chaos in boarding due to little space at the A Coruña airport and erroneous instructions from the company staff, the lines with priority were not differentiated from those that were not. On the flight, the cabin crew did not speak Spanish on a flight over Spanish airspace. Puntual, caos en el embarque debido al poco espacio en el aeropuerto de A Coruña y a las indicaciones erróneas del personal de la compañía, no se diferenciaban las filas con prioridad de las que no lo eran. En el vuelo, el personal de cabina no hablaba español en un vuelo sobre espacio aéreo español.

### "good customer service"
I have always had a good experience with Volotea. Easy to book with competitive prices, they fly to the airports most important to me, good customer service both on the ground and in the air. Recommended

### "great discount offers"
I have made several trips from 2024 to the present. I have been able to take advantage of the great discount offers, both as a MEGAVOLOTEA and as a passenger. It has been very easy for me to change flight dates when I have needed it in a very satisfactory manner and I have been very pleasantly surprised that we almost always arrive at the destination very punctually and without last minute problems. Thank you VOLOTEA for allowing me to travel among the clouds without incident and with exquisite attention from the crew. He realizado varios viajes desde 2024 a la actualidad. He sabido aprovechar las estupendas ofertas que tiene en los descuentos, tanto como MEGAVOLOTEA como pasajera.

I often travel with Volotea from Asturias to Valencia, and I am very happy with this company. The frequency and schedule of the flights are extensive and the flight experience is very pleasant. You travel with peace of mind, it always arrives on time and the space is comfortable. On the other hand, I am a member of their Mega Volotea service and the services offered cover my needs to a large extent: the possibility of carrying cabin luggage and checking in at no cost, the possibility of changing flights. It is the first company I explored when I need to fly.

Otherwise highly recommended for punctuality, prices and staff.

### "Customer service is really terrible"
Flight was canceled without guideline how to get replacement. I claimed compensation based on EU regulations. However, their Customer service is really terrible. I exchanged email more than 80 times, however, it has not been solved. because they have not clarified contact address that have responsibility on the compensation. They said the preparation for the compensation is complete but they don't know my bank account. As they instruct me to send bank account, I sent it to them. They said that you should sent it to Claim department. I asked address of it, but they never let me know. They simply avoid paying money in spite of their obligation.

### "Service has thus far been exemplary"
Not my first time with this airline and have further flights. I found Volotea quite transparent in all their cost. Service has thus far been exemplary and in one case of a delay (‘technical issues’ ) I was recompensed for any inconvenience with a voucher redeemable against any other flight in the next twelve months - which to me seemed like very good customer service.

### "service on board was excellent"

### "Convenient schedules and clean planes"
I often travel with Volotea, mainly because of their convenient schedules to and from Florence. For this reason, I joined the Megavolotea programme, which I recommend to everyone.

The flights have always been punctual, although that might have just been my luck. The staff are always very kind, the planes are clean, and the booking process is simple and efficient. In short, among low-cost airlines, I consider it to be the best. | Viaggio spesso con Volotea soprattutto perché ha orari comodi da e per Firenze. Per questo ho aderito al programma Megavolotea che consiglio a tutti. C'è un periodo gratuito di prova e si può approfittare di vantagi, il migliore dei quali è il bagaglio da cabina compreso nel prezzo. I voli sono sempre stati puntuali, ma questa potrebbe essere stata solo una mia fortuna. Il personale è davvero sempre gentile, gli aerei sono puliti e le modalità di prenotazione semplici ed efficaci. Insomma fra le low cost ritengo sia la migliore

Not Verified | I flew with Volotea for the first time, I hadn’t heard of them before but saw a lot a good reviews on here. The check-in process was straightforward, and the flight departed on time. However airport staff were very polite (I had some questions about my bag but they were quite rude) and so that takes some points away for me, other than that it was ok.

### “excellent service”
Great airline with excellent service! Modern and comfortable planes, professional and well-groomed cabin crew, and even positive messages on the aircraft's body and wings. Everything ran smoothly and on schedule. Reasonable price for the tickets. Highly recommend Volotea!

### "good to fly with Volotea"
It is always good to fly with Volotea. I used to fly before as single and now with family (husband, baby and 3y old girl) Volotea makes our live easier before/during and after flying. They are professional, fares are ok and as Megavolotea member you have more advantages. Would love if they open more lines in small airports like Almeria where we live. Looking forward for our X-mas break again in Asturias.

### Volotea customer review
Very good experience. Priority line worked flawlessly and it's good that people with fidelity program always have a cabin baggage included. It's also very nice that fidelity program reserves you a hot drink for free during the flight, and the flight is very relaxing. Landing and departing timings respected, and seats are comfortable enough.

### “flying couldn’t get more convenient”
Volotea is to me the quintessential no-frills airline. With its Megavolotea offering, flying couldn’t get more convenient and rewarding, even if you are saving. The big difference is that despite of the business model that charges for everything, Volotea has managed to eliminate the pain of having to choose and pay for your choices by making you feel especial when you decide to join their Megavolotea program (at a cost too! ).

### “modern and comfortable planes”
Volo molto spesso in questa tratta, Volotea, ha prezzi concorrenziali, utilizza aerei moderni e confortevoli e riesce quasi sempre a rispettare gli orari.

### “everything was perfect”
Volotea is a very good company. I am a Megavolotea Plus customer and I fly Nice - Luxembourg. My last flight, on November 18, 2024, from Luxembourg to Nice. As usual with Volotea everything was perfect from boarding to arrival. We even arrived 15 minutes early.

Great airline. Fantastic people at check in, offering to change seats (to be able to sit together with 2 separate booking numbers) to put the luggage in hold even though it was a hand luggage (do we could take liquids).

### "Everything was very comfortable."
Everything was very comfortable from the moment we arrived at the airport (and that’s saying something, as we were travelling with an 18-month-old baby). The treatment was always kind and courteous. The service on the aircraft was wonderful, especially when they explained how to use the seatbelt and where we could change the baby. Everything was excellent.

Punctuality, clean aircraft, kindness of the cabin crew and they speak French, friendly price. Large choice of destinations from Nantes There was a jetbridge in Prague, better for the boarding.

### "satisfied every time"

For a low cost carrier, Volotea aircrafts are rather comfortable, seats are very thin that let a large place for the legs. Cabin crew are very friendly and professional. Hand-luggage policy is very clear but also flexible, when you have a big cabin bag allowed, you are also allowed to put it for free in the hold. Very appreciated!

Precise and punctual flight, in fact it arrived a few dozen minutes early both on the outward and return journeys. I often fly with this company from Florence to Olbia and Hamburg.

I recently had the pleasure of flying with Volotea and participating in their Megavolotea program, and I can confidently say it was one of the best travel experiences I've ever had!

Whether you're flying for business or pleasure, you won't be disappointed with the exceptional service and great value they provide. I can’t wait to fly with Volotea again!

### “price point should be a lower one”
The Palermo-Florence route is well served by Volotea, typically with timely flight. However, the price point, especially for Megavolotea customers should be a lower one. Every time, I see the email advertising at €22 per leg and when I go and buy it is always not less than €60-80. At the very least, Megavolotea customers should be automatically given priority boarding and in cabin 10kg baggage, if the price point cannot be adjusted. In cabin personnel is always professional and courteous.

The ground handling do it the boarding in advance to save time to go inside the plane and do it the procedure faster with own staff in Malaga Airport.

### "staff are very pleasant"
Easy reservation on the website. Just inconsistencies when editing boarding passes, impossible to get them by email. But nothing serious. On the other hand, it was a little annoying to receive an email saying that I had to register when I had already done so. The company is very professional and on time and the ground and flight staff are very pleasant. | Réservation facile sur le site internet. Juste des incohérences lors de l’édition des cartes d’embarquement impossible de les avoir par mail. Mais rien de grave. Par contre un peu gênant de recevoir un mail disant qu’il fallait s’enregistrer alors que je l’avais déjà fait. La compagnie est très pro et à l’heure et le personnel au sol et naviguant sont très agréables.

### "crew was charming"
The flight went very well. The landing was perfect and smooth. The crew was charming. The plane left and arrived on time. I have been using Volotea for 4 years and I have never had any problem which has not been the case with so-called first rate companies | Le vol s est très bien passé. L atterrissage a été parfait tout en douceur. L equipage était charmant. L avion est parti et arrivé à l heure. J utilise Volotea depuis 4 ans et je n ai jamais eu aucun problème ce qui n a pas été le cas avec des compagnies soi disant de premier ordre

### "staff are kind and helpful"
I have used Volotea many times, and I must say that flights are always on time. The staff are very kind and helpful. The boarding process is quite quick and acces to the aircraft goes quite quick as well. Im having Megavolotea Plus, which gives me 10 kg cabin bag for free, free seat and priority boarding which is very convenient to me. When you're boarding the aircraft, a music plays in background and that gives a good start on your journey.

### "In short, a very good trip"
Not Verified | Very pleasant flight. Schedules respected. On-board staff attentive to passengers' requests and considerate: as my wife and I are elderly, they placed our cabin luggage in the trunks provided for this purpose and returned it to us on arrival.

Personnel de bord attentif aux demandes des passagers et prévenant : comme ma femme et moi sommes agés ils nous ont placés nos bagages cabines dans les coffres prévus à cet effet et nous les ont rendus à l'arrivée. bref un très bon voyage.

### "enjoyed my experience"
Completely enjoyed my experience with VOLOTEA. This is not the first time I have flown VOLOTEA, and I find the cost of flying with them and the experience to be a great one. Customer service reps are always polite, courteous and friendly. It is a quick flight over a short destination but enjoyable because of the level and quality of service provided.

### "travel regularly with Volotea"
I travel regularly with Volotea to visit my family and I'm always very satisfied: punctuality of flights, friendly cabin crew, in-flight information from the pilot and the comfort of the aircraft. On top of that, prices are always affordable, and Volotea is very often the only airline to offer these travel itineraries. MegaVolotea membership is also very attractive, particularly in terms of the baggage policy and flight discounts.

### "Excellent quality-price"
Excellent quality-price, service-minded good crew, pleasant flight(s), information transmission by the app was OK, summarized: how it should be organised by every carrier,

### “Really great value for money”
Excellent travel with Volotea. It was punctual, no hassle, baggage drop was fast and efficient. Really great value for money. Seat comfort was really good.

### "a disappointing experience"
The purser and the cabin crew had no interest in looking after the passengers. It was evident that they only cared about telling each other the latest anecdotes or even making negative comments about a passenger. Customer service was non-existent, a disappointing experience. I pay for Megavolotea and will not renew the contract. Incidentally, my NPS was incorrectly counted as positive in a query after landing, surely a "technical problem".

### "We were very satisfied"
We were very satisfied with our return flight from Bordeaux to Figari. For once, there were no delays, both flights were on time and even arrived a little early. Check-in was very efficient and the staff both on the ground and in flight were very pleasant and helpful. Nous avons été très satisfaits de notre vol A/R Bordeaux-Figari. Pour une fois, il n'y a eu aucun retard, les 2 vols étaient à l'heure et sont même arrivés avec un peu d'avance. L'enregistrement a été très efficace et le personnel tant au sol qu'en vol très agréable et serviable.

### "very convenient for me"
I am a Megavolotea plus customer. For family reasons I often take Volotea flights from Bari Palese to Athens round trip. It is an excellent Spanish airline that is very convenient for me because the trip lasts more or less an hour and for this reason I always suggest it to my relatives and friends. I have a suggestion to give: It would be appropriate for Volotea to serve this line for 12 months a year. The price is very convenient with the Megavolotea plus card especially in the presence of convenient offers. Sono un cliente Megavolotea plus. Per motivi di famiglia molto spesso prendo gli aerei della Volotea da Bari Palese ad Atene andata e ritorno. E’ un’ottima compagnia aerea Spagnola molto comoda per me perché il viaggio dura più o meno un’ora e per questo la propongo sempre ai miei parenti ed amici. Avrei un suggerimento da dare: Sarebbe opportuno che la Volotea serva questa linea per 12 mesi l’anno. Il prezzo è molto conveniente fatto con la tessera Megavolotea plus specialmente in presenza di offerte convenienti.

### “clean and tidy cabin”
Regular boarding, clean and tidy cabin, comfortable seat, attentive and kind staff, flight departed late, comfortable flight, flight arrived late, very slow baggage delivery.

### "high customer focus"
My flight was a round trip from Verona. Since Volotea started flying, I prefer to choose this company because it has never proven itself wrong and has always been a low cost company with high customer focus. Kindness of the operators at check-in and also on the aircraft. Cleanliness of vehicles, large spaces between seats, in-flight recoveries even in delays even with advance payments, excellent offers even if flights to Pantelleria from Verona have been reduced. l mio volo è stato un'andata e ritorno da verona . Da quando Volotea ha incominciato a volare, preferisco scegliere questa compagnia perché non si è mai smentita ed è sempre stata una compagnia low cost con alta attensione al cliente.

Round trip flight. Fast boarding. Very professional and pleasant cabin crew. Our flight arrived before the scheduled time. Very competitive ticket prices.

### “Quite satisfied with the different services”
Quite satisfied with the different services (airport, on Board,) : considering the fares, the quality is top. The team in charge is professional, serious, helpful, very positive. I do appreciate being treated as a “normal” customer and not a low cost occasional client. I do recommend Volotea for leisure flight.

### “extremely satisfied”
I travel very regularly with the company Volotea on the route, Nantes Figari and Figari Nantes. I am extremely satisfied with this company in terms of value for money and punctuality. I find that the staff of this company are always very pleasant.

### “ staff are pleasant, smiling and attentive”
Volotea est rapide et organisé, l'embarquement se fait vite et il n'y a pas d'attente. Les vols intérieurs sont bien organisés et très rentables, étant concurrentiels vis à vis du train ou de la route. Le personnel a bord est agréable, souriant et à l'écoute. Le café à bord est bon et le confort convenable, pour le prix. - Volotea is fast and organized, boarding is quick and there is no waiting. Domestic flights are well organized and very profitable, being competitive with rail or road. The staff on board are pleasant, smiling and attentive. The coffee on board is good and the comfort is adequate, for the price.

### "waiting for refund 4 months late"
Appalling last minute cancellation at airport. No staff to advise. People lined up to check in bags. Board indicated which Counter but another airline using the counter. Suddenly board indicated flight cancelled less than 2 hours before departure when people already at the airport. No explanation & still waiting for refund 4 months later despite numerous requests. Absolutely disgusting treatment of customers.

### "everything was perfect"
The flight was on time and everything was perfect. The cabin crew was lovely, as always. This time we flew with a female pilot. Everything was fantastic. El vuelo ha salido puntual y ha sido todo perfecto. La tripulación de cabina encantadora,como siempre. Esta vez hemos volado con una piloto mujer. Todo fantástico

### "departure of our first flight was 2 hours late"
Not Verified | Sadly the departure of our first flight was 2 hours late. We were very upset as we lost the car we had originally hired due to our poor timing. We were not given any compensation or even a complimentary drink on the flight. The return journey was nearly perfect, but the stewardess realised we were flying with Mega priority at the last ten minutes and offered me my free coffee or tea - rather late as we were about to land.

### “Always the best option”
Siempre la mejor opción para volar desde Asturias, buenos horarios, buenos precios. La puntualidad que tienen es un voto a favor, asi como los beneficios de su programa Megavolotea, mejores precios, equipaje gratis, embarque prioritario. Todo el personal siempre muy atento y aviones en perfecto estado ademas de comodos. - Always the best option to fly from Asturias, good schedules, good prices. Their punctuality is a vote in favor, as well as the benefits of their Megavolotea program, better prices, free luggage, priority boarding. All the staff are always very attentive and the planes are in perfect condition as well as comfortable.

### "assistance of the staff was excellent"
Volotea is a low-cost airline capable of giving excellent service, especially with Megavolotea Plus, which gives a number of benefits at a limited annual cost. At all stages, from check-in, to boarding, to cabin accommodation, the assistance of the staff was excellent. Even on our return, having had a serious back pain problem, we were constantly assisted with both checked and carry-on baggage. Absolutely to recommend (already done with several friends)! Only downside: the company should increase the number of locations served, both in Italy and Europe, ensuring more travel options.

### “Volotea can only improve”
Our flight to Mykonos was the second one made this year. In May we were in Palermo, on September in Greece. In both cases the procedures of check-in, boarding and the flight itself were perfect, without any delay or problem. Being a Megavolotea Plus client, myself and my wife we had priority boarding and supplementary free baggage. Furthermore, choosing the seats in front by a little surcharge, we had a very comfortable flight. Last but not least, the very young flight staff was always very friendly and helpful. Also, on the way back from Mykonos, we have got help with check-in for hold luggage, and hand luggage transport on the plane, since I had serious troubles with back pain. I have already recommended several friends to fly with Volotea, although I must say that the company should increase the number of locations it serves with its flights, both in Italy and elsewhere in Europe. In any case, I think I am not wrong in saying that at the moment Volotea is the best cheap flight company considering the ratio of fares and quality of services offered. Volotea can (and hopefully should) only improve. We look forward to the next trip!

### "responded promptly to my doubts"
Volotea, since I purchased the tickets has responded promptly to my doubts and questions regarding Mega Volotea, also regarding the refund of airport taxes for a member of my group who withdrew and I received the refund immediately. The hand luggage delivery at check-in is very convenient, as you don't lift weights inside the plane and I was able to insert liquids greater than a liter that don't pass through the control. The check-in staff was also friendly and helpful. Volotea, fin da quando ho acquistato i biglietti ha sempre risposto con sollecitudine ai miei dubbi e alle mie domande riguardo Mega Volotea, riguardo anche al rimborso delle tasse aeroportuali per un componente del mio gruppo che si è ritirato ed ho ricevuto il rimborso in tempo immediato. Gli aerei sono stati puntualissimi. La consegna gratuita del bagaglio al mano al check-in risulta molto comoda, in quanto non si alzano pesi all'Interno dell'aereo ed ho potuto inserire liquidi superiori al litro che al controllo non passano. Anche il personale del check in è stato cordiale e disponibile!

### “flight crew were smiling”
Very good trip. The flight crew spoke French, the plane was clean and we had room. The flight crew were smiling and they seemed to work in a good atmosphere, unlike other airlines.

### "Very good value for money"
Perfect, I often travel with Volotea. Very good value for money. Several possible destinations from Brest. Competitive prices. Possibilities for additional options. Parfait , je voyage souvent avec Volotea . Rapport qualité prix très bon . Plusieurs destinations possibles à partir de Brest. Prix compétitifs  Possibilités d’options supplémentaires .

### “it was a fantastic experience”
The personnel at the airport were kind and friendly and efficient. The boarding process was smooth and easy. Whilst in the air, the flight attendants were courteous, kind and friendly. They all had smiles on their faces. I felt like it had quite a lot of legroom, especially for a low-cost carrier and I am 177 cm tall. We arrived over 15 minutes early and our baggage came very quickly. Overall, it was a fantastic experience. I really enjoyed flying with Volotea.

### “attentive and professional staff”
Not Verified | Le vol très agréable personnel a l'écoute et professionnel .Nous sommes arrivés avec 10 minutes d'avance. Parfait, je recommande cette compagnie je n'ai jamais eu de problèmes. - The flight was very pleasant, attentive and professional staff. We arrived 10 minutes early. Perfect, I recommend this company I have never had any problems.

### "professional and kind crew"
Not Verified | The airplane is very clean, a very professional and kind crew, the aircraft is quite spacious and comfy. They have a good offer of drinks and foods. The pilots guarantee a very good and smooth landing in Firenze.

### “Value for money”
Not Verified | Puntualità dei tempi di volo e semplicità nelle operazioni di prenotazione e check in. Rapporto qualità prezzo, possibilità di usufruire di sconti con MEGAVOLOTEA PLUS. - Punctuality of flight times and simplicity in booking and check-in operations. Value for money, possibility of taking advantage of discounts with MEGAVOLOTEA PLUS.

### “Polite flight crew”
Usually on time, very well organized with respect to offloading/loading. Polite flight crew, but as expected from a budget airline no inflight service.

### "good value for money"
Not Verified | Good value for money. The trip went well, the Volotea platform with wifi allows you to pass the time. The hostesses were top notch, professional! | Bon rapport qualité/prix. Le voyage c'est bien passé, la plateforme Volotea avec le wifi permet de passer le temps. Les hôtesses étaient au top, professionnels !

### "Very good trip"
Very good trip, punctual, easy site to use, friendly staff. Car rental and insurance reimbursement is carried out very quickly without difficult discussions. Tres bon voyage,ponctuel,site aise a utiliser, personnel affable. remboursement location auto et assurance effectue tres rapidement sans discussions penibles.

### “Staff were friendly and helpful”
Never flown Volotea before - no problems whatsoever. The booking on the website took a little getting used to but we soon mastered it. It is a pain that if not paying to select seats, one can only check in 4 days before flight - so we checked in for retunr flight whilst in hotel and hotel printed boarding pass for us. I also downloaded the boarding cards onto the volotea app on my phone, which worked well. Flights were fine, arriving ahead of schedule on flight to corsica and making up some of the delay on the way back. Staff were friendly and helpful. The cabin luggage restrictions are a bit tighter than other airlines eg EasyJet, but everyone fitted their luggage in OK, so the Volotea approach works and is useful I would have no hesitation in travelling with Volotea again and have paid for the mega Volotea fidelity card. They also have music playing during the flight.

### “very pleased with service on board”
Not Verified | I was very pleased with service on board. Easy to reserve flight and to get boarding pass. Flight on time. I will use again Volotea to travel itineraries in France.

### "Very good experience"
Excellent counter service where staff is attentive and helpful. Aircraft new or well-maintained, cabin clean, flight staff very efficient and helpful. Good seating (luckily had seat 11F on a security exit row with extra leg space). On-time performance. Very good experience altogether considering my personal 31 years of experience as an airline staff. I forgot to mention the free in-flight entertainment.

### “Friendly and competent staff”
Not Verified | Le voyage s'est très bien passé. Personnel sympathique et compétent. Je regrette qu'une boisson ne soit pas offerte à bord. Surtout que j'ai acheté une carte donnant des avantages. - The trip went very well. Friendly and competent staff. I regret that a drink is not offered on board. Especially since I bought a card giving advantages.

### “Good choice for European travelers”
Not Verified | Good Airline, comfortable aircraft and flying on time to our destination. Disembarking with finger is always comfortable and a plus that usually low cost airlines don’t use. Good choice for European travelers but not many destinations from Milan.

### “Very bad customer service”
Not Verified | We missed our flight Athens to Bordeaux because of a delay of 2 hours on our connexion from Milos to Athens. When we landed we went to the gate and I explained we were late because of a storm and so we could not check in our luggage for which we paid. The steward did not want to hear anything and said "I already have my list and I am onboarding all the people on my list that's it". Reasonably enough we understand we were late and could not be on that plane. We then booked with another Company for the next day because it was our only option. I then contacted Trip.com for a refund of the Volotea flight and in 24 hours everything was sorted. However for the additional fee we paid for the 23kg luggage we paid the very day via Volotea website, Trip.com told us to contact directly Volotea. And guess what.. They don't want to refund us. Period. So they take your money for a luggage they did not carry, even though your flight was refunded. Very bad customer service here, this company is a No Go!

### “staff are super friendly and helpful”
This was our second trip with Volotea and we loved it! The on and off boarding went really smoothly. The staff are super friendly and helpful. What we especially appreciate compared to other (low-cost) airlines is the physical space in the plane – it's so much more comfortable!

### “Good service and good flight”
Buena atención y buen vuelo, en general todo muy correcto. En la salida de Barcelona muy puntual y el el regreso, por culpa de las tormentas se demoró pero solo una media hora. - Good service and good flight, in general everything was very correct. The departure from Barcelona was very punctual and the return was delayed only by half an hour due to storms.

### "very pleasant experience"
Thank you for this very pleasant experience. Everything went very well. Thanks to the flight attendants and the entire team. Perfect flight, perfect check-in, no problems with luggage. Merci pour cet vio très agréable Tout se passé très bien Merci aux hôtesses d’air et à tout L’Equipe Vol parfait , enregistrement nickel, aucun soucis avec les bagages.

### “extremely disappointed in idle promises”
Not Verified | My luggage was lost from Olbia to Venice. The luggage was only found 12 days later. It was badly damaged Volotea had promised to compensate euros 210 for the time I had no luggage. This compensation was never paid. Furthermore, Volotea refused to pay for the damaged luggage which had gone to Munich and Amsterdam instead of Venice. I am extremely disappointed in their idle promises and suggesting that the damaged luggage was merely wear and tear.

### "had a really good time"
We had a great time with this company, very punctual and precise, the pilots were very good especially in the landing and the staff very helpful and friendly. I recommend this company because we had a really good time.

### "very efficient and friendly"
In spite of a delay due to the late arrival of the plane and another delay due to the traffic organisation, our plane landed in Brest only 15 minutes late. The pilots and the crew were very efficient and friendly.

### "comfortable seats"
Very punctual both on the outward and return journey, fast baggage delivery, comfortable seats with sufficient legroom. Kindness of the operators on board, quiet journey, it didn't feel like being at the market like in other low cost airlines. Puntualissimi sia nel viaggio di andata che al ritorno, riconsegna dei bagagli veloce, poltrone comode con sufficiente spazio per le gambe. Gentilezza delle operatrici a bordo, viaggio tranquillo, non sembrava di essere al mercato come in altre compagnie low cost.

### “highly recommend”
Cerco di prenotare sempre con Volotea,primo perché mi permette di viaggiare con il mio piccolo cane,e perché come costi ,personale mi trovo sempre benissimo,mi sono anche iscritta membromegavoloteaplus cosi ogni volta vedo molte scontistiche,io la consiglio vivamente. - I always try to book with Volotea, first because it allows me to travel with my little dog, and because in terms of costs, staff I always feel great, I also signed up as a megavoloteaplus member so every time I see many discounts, I highly recommend you.

### “Very good airline!”
Very good airline! I like their policy, which is to satisfy their customers and to be environmentally responsible. Both the flight and ground staff are very pleasant and smiley, the aircraft is clean and quite comfortable for this type of flight. Multimedia platform much appreciated, and easy to use during the flight, with a nice choice of multimedia content. I've signed up for the mega Volotea plus loyalty programme, so I'll see if it's worth it, but in any case I'd like to use this airline again for two more flights and try out the loyalty benefits!

### “treated in a rude and offensive way”
During check-in, we were informed there was a spelling mistake in the name on the ticket. Probably a typo during booking. After being treated in a rude and offensive way by the manager of the check-in employee, we were obliged to pay 538 euro to correct the name whereas the initial ticket price was 120 euro. Although other airlines do these corrections free of charge, I would understand (since it is low-cost) that we need to pay a small administrative fee (e.g. 40 euro) to correct the name but 538 euro is excessive and completely out of any reasonable proportion. Even after 2 friendly and constructive customer service requests with the Volotea service desk, Volotea is not open to come to a reasonable agreement. If this is the way Volotea is treating their customers, they will end up having none. This short term focus on getting money out of the pockets of their customers will alwasy have a long term negative impact on their company.

### “cabin crew was nice and welcoming”
Not Verified | Overall the flight was fairly good. The cabin crew was nice and welcoming everyone. During the flight I was able to have a large leg seat which allowed comfort during the flight. The flight only had a minor delay due to onboarding, but we arrived in time in Mykonos coming from Athens. I would recommend the company since we flew 4 times on 2 weeks with Volotea.

### "Megavolotea subscription is very convenient"
The Megavolotea subscription is very convenient and gives access to many services. the on-board entertainment, films and games is fantastic. I suggest always subscribing to it

### “Very satisfied”
Not Verified | Nothing to say except that both company and crew are very professional. The flight had a two hours delay but they did their best not to cancel it. Very satisfied.

### "excellent quality/price"
First time with Volotea, aircraft on time both on the outward and return journeys despite it being August, comfortable seats and the possibility of connecting via wi fi to their entertainment platform! All ok, purchased the ticket in January and excellent quality/price, also purchased megavolotea customer package.

### "would rather ruin your trip and steal every penny"
Similar to Mexico's Volaris in that they would rather ruin your trip and steal every penny from you the first time you fly than treat the passenger like a customer and earn their money from happy returning customers. If you are flying without luggage maybe they won't figure out how to to you if as badly but they will certainly try. The check in experience sets the tone with ride counter help and long lines. It will only get worse from there. And, ultimately we paid more on the tickets and fees than had I flown a first class carrier. No, I'm not exaggerating. $126 Euros for one checked bag. $96 Euros for a 10k carryon.

### "Excellent service with value for money"
Excellent service with value for money tickets. I appreciated the app which made it super easy to book the tickets, add the services and make the check-in. Besides these features, it's an asset to have MegaVolotea Plus subscription, which offers free luggage on board and priority boarding and furthermore instant access to help center with whats up service!

### "planes are clean and modern"
Excellent company. The planes are clean and modern, I travel very regularly privately and professionally by plane and I am still very satisfied with the Volotea company. For my part, the planes are always on time, the staff is pleasant. Hoping for the opening of future destinations from Caen. | Excellente compagnie. Les avions sont propres et modernes, Je voyage très régulièrement à titre privé comme professionnel en avion et je suis toujours aussi satisfaite de la compagnie Volotea. Les avions sont pour ma part toujours à l'heure, le personnel est agréable. En espérant l'ouverture de prochaines destinations depuis Caen.

### "Reasonable prices"
Great company. Reasonable prices, but very good service, kindness, closeness. And they also cover less crowded routes providing great service. Everything perfect. Gran compañía. Precios razonables, pero muy buen servicio, amabilidad, cercanía. Y además cubren trayectos poco masificados dando un gran servicio. Todo perfecto.

### "a very good experience"
We had a very good experience with Volotea. Quick boarding, clean and well equipped aircraft, kind staff and cheap tickets! Very recommended. In my opinion it is the best low cost airline so far!

### "Better than other low cost airlines"
Not Verified | Flight left a little late but made up for the lost time. Flight attendants were friendly and helpful. My wife has mobility issues and the flight attendant came over to personally give her safety instructions. Better than a lot of other low cost airlines.

### "found everything perfect"
Family trip. It was the first time I booked with this company. I found everything perfect, flight on time. Friendly staff both on the ground and in the air. Clean aircraft. We had no problems. | Viaggio in famiglia. Era la prima volta che prenotavo con questa compagnia. Ho trovato tutto perfetto, volo in orario. Gentile lo staff sia a terra che in volo. Aeromobile pulito. Non abbiamo avuto problemi.

### "Comfortable trip, very professional"
Comfortable trip, very professional and helpful staff. The two commanders were very good especially in the landing phase. Even though I didn't book the seats, my family members were not separated, but the seats were next to each other. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE COMPANY | Viaggio confortevole, personale molto professionale e disponibile. I due comandanti sono stati molto bravi soprattutto nella fase di atterraggio. Per quanto non abbia prenotato i posti i componenti della mia famiglia non sono stati divisi, ma i posti erano uno accanto all'altro. CONSIGLIO VIVAMENTE LA COMPAGNIA

### "Very friendly staff"
Not Verified | Very friendly staff, super timely flight, comfortable journey, truly perfect take off and landing. I will definitely fly with this company again | Personale molto gentile, volo in super orario, viaggio confortevole, decollo e atterraggio veramente perfetti. Tornerò sicuramente a volare con questa compagnia

### "Very smooth flight"
Very satisfied, only 10 minutes late due to plane traffic in Athens. All perfect. Very smooth flight, very friendly and professional staff | Molto soddisfatta, solo 10 minuti di ritardo per traffico di aerei ad Atene. Tutto perfetto. Volo molto tranquillo, personale molto gentile e professionale

### “Volotea you need to do better”
This event just happened and I'm still steaming over it. So writing this review might be over raged. With a party of 4 people we got to our gate 18 minutes before our flight takes off. And we were turned down to enter the plane. We were legit there and the gates were still open and they still didn't allow us through. We needed to technically be there 20 minutes before take off and for 2 minutes we couldn't go through. I understand that we were 2 minutes late but the gentleman at the gate was sooo rude and didn't even try to accommodate. Everything seemed to still be open. This guy made it his missions to not help us out. Part 2. Trying to contact the Volotea help desk was a joke. There isn't a representative at the airport. And, when I tried to call of course they were closed. So, we went to the airport help desk and the only help they can offer was to book a ticket to the next available flight. Something that we just did ourselves. The airport general staff were nice and kind. Directing us to the right people to talk to. Even though it didnt really go anywhere. Volotea you need to do better.

### "Zero customer care"
A low cost airline that uses deceptive tactics to extract more money from unsuspecting passengers. I'd prefer an airline that charged 10-30 euro more per flight in full transparency, over an underhanded airline that offers cut-price flights only to add extras. I was not informed via email prior that I must checkin online before the airport, or I'd have to pay an extra 30 euro! As an uninformed customer, I just expected Volotea to operate like all the other airlines I've used in 20+ years of flying. Sure there's probably fineprint somewhere, but that's deceptive, knowing that customers won't read it. When I contacted customer care with my receipt expecting a 30 euro refund due to the fact I wasn't informed, every time I just received the same generic response that could've been written by an AI. Zero customer care or human contact. Finally, I signed up for the free trial of Megavolotea and then 99 euro was taken from my account unexpectedly. No notice to inform me the trial would end and a charge would be made. Deceptive practices again, but I decided to just keep it and fly Volotea as much as possible for the year due to the subscription that offers nothing much except for early boarding. Once I realised Volotea scam unsuspecting customers with a 30 euro fee for checking in, I no longer had any trust or brand loyalty, so I asked for my 99 euro Megavolotea subscription back. I will not fly Volotea again, as I don't know what other random charges they place on unsuspecting guests and when issues arise, guests are simply ignored with automated AI emails. Zero confidence in any company that uses deceptive tactics to generate more revenue from unsuspecting passengers.

### “good service”
All things were ok, good service. I've had a little problem with my reservation but immediately resolved by the customer service.

### "good value for money"
Great company, very warm welcome upon boarding, good value for money, very pleasant service in the cabin, respected schedules, very clean, ultra-fast boarding. Super compagnie, très bon accueil à l'embarquement, bon rapport qualité prix, service très agréable en cabine, horaires respectés, très propre, embarquement ultyra rapide

### “everything was flawless”
We wanted a quick, cheap flight to accommodate our travels from Croatia to Greece, and we pick Volotea because of the flexibility. We have discount airlines in the US and the are not anywhere close to the experience and price we found on Volotea. From check-in to landing, everything was flawless. The price was unbeatable and we look forward to our next trip to Europe to take advantage of the flights they have throughout the continent.

### "staff is very helpful"
Volotea is a punctual company and the staff is very helpful, nice and efficient. The services are very good for the price paid, for example the boarding which is very efficient.

### "wasn’t given to option to check in online"
They charge €30 per person to check in at the airport. I wasn’t given to option to check in online as I went through Skyscanner.

### “staff was friendly and professional”
Everything was on par with my expectations from the beginning to the end, and the plane was on time. I have nothing to complain about. The staff was friendly and professional.

### "Overall a good experience"
Both our flights (to go to Naples and return back home) were on time. No delays. In both our flights we had two small suitcases and two back packs that we took in the cabin without an issue. Personnel was nice and polite. The flight was just fine. Overall a good experience.

### “staff are friendly and responsive”
I travelled with Volotea in April, May and June on the Bordeaux - Düsseldorf return flight. Each time I was delighted with my flight. Volotea operated flights even when they were far from full, unlike other low-cost airlines. The staff are friendly and responsive. The seats were wide enough for me to sit in with a BMI of 40, so I didn't even need to extend my seatbelt. I was happy with the pilots, obviously experienced, there were no jerks and shouts like I sometimes experienced with Ryanair. Thanks to Megavolotea, Volotea offers a lot of flexibility, such as postponing your flight up to 7 days before departure. And you can even cancel up to 4 hours if you take the flex option, which is not expensive for this flexibility. I've subscribed to Megavolotea Plus and I'm entitled to a soluble coffee which I find quite simply excellent. I would like to thank the entire Volotea team for their professionnalism.

### "Very good prices2
Good company, very friendly cabin crew, clean aircraft, on-time flight. Very good prices. Very fast boarding. In Europe, one of the best airlines I have flown with.

### "Punctual airline"
Beyond all expectations with its customer service, friendly and helpful ground and flight staff. Punctual airline that manages to meet all or good matches of passenger needs.

### “highly recommended”
Excellent flight on time, friendly and helpful staff, good service on board, highly recommended. I was impressed by the efficiency of the staff and very happy to arrive in advance at destination.

### "staff is outgoing, welcoming"
Not Verified |   Obtaining boarding passes through the app is simple and easy. Quick check-in at the airport. Take-off and landing schedule respected. The staff is outgoing, welcoming and friendly. Obtention des cartes d’embarquement via l’application est simple et facile . Enregistrement rapide à l’aéroport. horaire de décollage et atterrissage respectés. Le personnel est avenant, accueillant et sympathique.

### "very pleasant on-board staff."
Very satisfied with fast boarding (Volotéa priority). The return flight without any delay with very pleasant on-board staff. the comfort of the plane is very good for this short distance flight and the legroom is acceptable.

### "very happy to choose the company"
Not Verified | We were very happy to choose the company, however a problem occurred when departing from Nice. My daughter and I went from door to door because the announcement made on the notice board at the airport did not really correspond to “reality” according to the messages. In the end, we left around 10:30 p.m. instead of 9:10 p.m. (a delay which was then explained to us upon arrival by the pilot: storm in Luxembourg, hence delay of the plane to Nice). We were forced to urgently call our reserved hotel regarding our unplanned late arrival. (+ Uber journey to accommodation) This concerns the Nice Nantes flight departure Friday May 24. This is a shame. For information, the return was without problem and we were very happy. Best regards | Nous avons été très heureux de choisir la compagnie cependant un problème est intervenu au départ de Nice. Ma fille et moi avons été de portes en portes car l’annonce faite sur le tableau d’affichage à l’aéroport ne correspondait pas trop à la « réalité » selon les messages. Au final, nous sommes parties vers 22h30 au lieu de 21h10 (retard qui nous a été expliqué ensuite à l’arrivée par le pilote : orage à Luxembourg d’où retard de l’avion sur Nice). Nous avons été contraints d’appeler d’urgence notre hôtel réservé par rapport à notre arrivée tardive non prévue. (+ trajet en uber vers l’hébergement) Cela concerne le Départ vol Nice Nantes vendredi 24 mai. Ceci est bien dommage, Pour information, le retour a été sans problème et nous étions très heureuses. Bien cordialement

### "I recommend this company"
A very friendly welcome, welcoming and attentive staff, the flight is on time on departure and even early on arrival. The captain's announcements are clear and audible. In short, I recommend this company without reservation | Un accueil très sympathique, un personnel accueillant et très à l’écoute, le vol est à l’heure au départ et même en avance à l’arrivée Les annonces du commandant sont claires et audibles Bref je recommande cette compagnie sans retenue

### “correct staff attention”
It has always been a pleasure to fly with VOLOTEA. Leg room, fast boarding, correct staff attention. To put a problem, that we do not learn to respect people, during the pandemic people disembarked in rows, and it was much more orderly, and I think even faster. Siempre ha sido un placer volar con VOLOTEA. Espacio para las piernas, Embarque rápido, atención correcto del personal. Por poner un problema, que no aprendemos a respetar a las personas, en pandemia se desembarcaba por filas, y era mucho más ordenado, y creo que incluso más rápido.

### "Très agréable surprise!"
Delighted by my return flight: Punctuality, welcoming, attentive staff. Quick and easy boarding. Comfort and cleanliness on the plane. Disturbance information given during the flight. I recommend Volotea. I would use it for a future trip without hesitation, even though I was apprehensive about this company, not knowing it and being a little afraid of a company that seemed lost cost to me. Very pleasant surprise! Ravie par mon vol aller/retour : Ponctualité, personnel accueillant, prévenant. Embarquement rapide et facile. Confort et propreté dans l avion. Informations de perturbations données durant le vol. Je recommande Volotea. Je l utiliserais pour un prochain voyage sans hésiter, alors que j apprehendais cette compagnie ne l'a connaissant pas et ayant un peu peur d une compagnie qui me paraissait lost cost. Très agréable surprise!

### "staff is friendly, pleasant"
Not Verified |   Good support upon boarding. Good flight: landing and takeoff done properly. The staff is friendly, pleasant, smiling. Quick installation on the plane. Bonne prise en charge à l'embarquement. Bon vol: atterrissage et décollage fait proprement. Le personnel est sympathique, agréable, souriant. Installation dans l'avion rapide

### “comfortable seating”
Low cost airline that does not act like one. Newer plane with comfortable seating. Snacks provided were satisfactory. No add on for first small bag. Add on for large bag is reasonable price. Web site is easy to use/navigate.

### "Comfortable plane"
Not Verified | Schedules respected Volotea staff very serious and friendly. Comfortable plane for this type of flight. Only problem, very attractive flight price but cost of having decent luggage for a stay, too expensive. It would be better to have a ticket 10/20€ more expensive and have 1 bag under seat + 1 cabin bag | Horaires respectés Personnel Volotea très sérieux et avenant Avion confortable pour ce type de vol Seul hic, prix du vol très intéressant mais coût pour avoir un bagage décent pour un séjour, trop onéreux. Mieux vaudrait un billet 10/20€ plus cher et avoir 1 bagage sous siège+ 1 bagage cabine

### "refusing any form of compensation"
My flight was cancelled one day before departure, resulting in over 200€ of extra expenses and Volotea refusing any form of compensation, despite the flight never taking place. The reason explained for the refusal being "the operation was affected by an air traffic controllers strike/industrial action by airport staff which is an unexpected situation beyond our control". I am even more disappointed by this result, because after receiving the notice of cancellation and wasting an entire afternoon of what could have been vacation to re-book my return trip, I was given the choice between a refund or a voucher - therefore, I had been expecting a refund for 10 days before being informed that it would be refused. There was no attempt by Volotea to provide any form of compensation whatsoever, with 100€ per ticket multiplied by the amount of passengers, that amounts to a lot of revenue for no service.

### “very friendly on-board staff”
Punctual, pleasant flight and very good pilot, very friendly on-board staff and seats with large and comfortable spaces compared to other low-cost airlines, highly recommended!

### “A pleasant trip”
Excellent service from this company. Elegance, no time wasted, affordable prices. We traveled as a family and I don't see anything to complain about. A pleasant trip as one would expect.

### "Our flight went very well"
Our flight went very well, at time going and return ,team are excellent during the trip, I recommend Volotea for very good services to all people home desire travel by plane.

### “crew were very polite and happy,”
The aircraft was very clean, the crew were very polite and happy, the take off was on time. I suggest to everyone to travel with Volotea at least one time to have an idea of them.

### "pleasant, stress-free experience"
Fully satisfied with both flights, outward and return. Both departed and arrived on time, despite lengthy boarding procedures due to the fact that the flights were full and there was a large amount of hand luggage to find room for. This testifies to the efficiency of the cabin staff. All in all, a pleasant, stress-free experience.

### "staff was friendly and professional"
Volotea is one of the best value. The plane was in good order and clean. The staff was friendly and professional and their add-on services were reasonably priced. Volotea is bridging the gap between low cost and high quality.

### “Plane very clean”
Perfect company, departure on time, arrival before time, personnel on board very kind, happy and pro. Plane very clean. Speedy boarding. Very good company for business travel and also family travel.

### "very attentive cabin staff"
Punctual flight both on the outward and return journey, or rather landed early on the return journey, brand new aircraft, very attentive and scrupulous cabin staff. Friendly and prepared ground staff both on the outward and return journey. | Volo puntuale sia all’andata che al ritorno, anzi al ritorno atterrato in anticipo, aeromobile nuovissimo, personale di cabina molto attento e scrupolo. Personale di terra gentile e preparato sia all’andata che al ritorno.

### “Comfortable plane”
Not Verified | Excellent treatment, nice cabin crew, all smiling, all really nice. Comfortable plane. Also, excellent pet-friendly policy, where if carrying a pet you can board in the first group with families, so that the pet does not stress so much in the boarding area.

### "staff is welcoming and attentive"
Comfortable plane, space for legs and luggage, the staff is welcoming and attentive. the flight is on time, it's a pleasure to fly with Volotea to Caen. Avion confortable, de l'espace pour les jambes et les bagages, le personnel est accueillant, aux petits soins. le vol est à l'heure, c'est un plaisir de voler avec Volotea vers Caen

### "Big seats and not delayed"
All fantastic. Big seats and not delayed. Bought the tickets by Volotea Web and all was very well and easy. The cabin crew was very gentle.

### “process was very smooth and efficient”
Not Verified | I would highly recommend this airline. The process was very smooth and efficient. All the staff are extremely helpful and very friendly and polite. The flight itself was very comfortable, good temperature, and comfortable seats with plenty of room. Take off was very smooth and landing was probably one of the best I have experienced. Being a nervous flyer that has definitely put my trust in Volatea. My only one negative, is that there is not enough selection of snack and sandwiches available on offer.

### "can’t check in the bags for free"
I bought 25 euros ticket from Stuttgart to Bordeaux and I paid 10 kg extra, so they said you can’t check in the bags for free, you have to pay 35 euros. I called the company hotline in Spain they said the same thing. How am i supposed to travel without bags?

### "service is also satisfactory"
Luckily Volotea is the only carrier from Genoa to Paris where I often go: it is not so necessary to make long detours to Milan or Rome. The service is also satisfactory. Per fortuna Volotea è l'unico vettore da Genova per Parigi dove vado spesso: non è così necessario fare lunghe deviazioni verso Milano o Roma. Anche il servizio è soddisfacente

### "experience was good"
Not Verified |  For a budget Airline the whole experience was good, compares well with others and the membership of Volotea was felt to be a benefit, The combo plus deal was simple to,apply and gave us what we wanted.

### "best low-cost I have used"
Good company, everything is going well, very good staff. I recommend this company, probably the best low-cost I have used. The only negative point (as with many companies) is the control of the size of cabin suitcases which are often out of standard. Bonne compagnie, tout c'est bien passer personnel très bien. je recommande cette compagnie, surement la meilleure low-cost je j'ai utiliser. Le seule point négatif (comme pour beaucoup de compagnie)c'est le control de la taille des valises cabine qui sont souvent hors norme

### “customer service is appalling”
Not Verified | On 29th November I booked a Volotea flight from Luxembourg to Nice and return for February 2024 The flight was confirmed and paid for by Visa card. On 13th December I noticed another debit on my Visa card for Eur 59,99. I found this surprising and did some research. During my research I discovered that my flights had been cancelled and that I had subscribed to annual service called Megavolotea. Apparently this is mandatory when you buy a Volotea flight! Given the time it took Volotea to cancel my flight after booking (2 weeks) and the time before the flight was to fly (3 months) I question whether the flight actually ever existed. To obtain reimbursement of the cost of my flight was more than a difficult experience. It is fairly impossible to speak to someone on the phone. You need to be a detective to find their phone number in France 0899 232 050. It's even more difficult to obtain reimbursement for the annual subscription of Eur 59,99. You have to do detective work to find a form on their website, then complete it and sent it by registered mail to an address in Spain. I'm now waiting to receive reimbursement of both amounts. Regrettably I cannot recommend this airline as their customer service is appalling. The first agent I spoke to gave me an e-mail address that didn't exist so I had to call back. The second agent was better and connected me to the same e-mail address by sending me an e-mail. Finally, I will not be traveling to Nice as planned. Very disappointed.

### "will be flying with Volotea again"
Both the flights to and from Malaga were enjoyable. The flight attendants on board were very polite and helpful and the ground staff at the airport were able to provide updated information. There must have been a glitch with the computer system as the messages to our cell phones put the flight an hour later than it was supposed to be. When I commented this to a ground staff , they were aware of the problem, which really wasn’t a problem at all. All the flight information available at the airport and through the airline was clear and accurate. I definitely will be flying with Volotea again.

### "I recommend this company"
Nothing to complain about this company, every time I travel with Volotea everything is perfect whether on the ground or in flight. I recommend this company with excellent value for money. Rien à reprocher à cette compagnie, à chaque fois que je voyage avec Volotea tout est parfait que ce soit au sol ou en vol. Je vous recommande cette compagnie avec un exellent rapport qualité/prix

### "pushing me to pay for the carry on bag"
At the gate from my flight yesterday from Hamburg to Florence, one staff at the gate said my bag would exceed the measurement of the carry on bag allowance. They had a stand at the gate where you can try to put in your bag if it fits or not. Mine was fine, there were even free space at the top. But the staff said it wouldn’t fit and told me to check it in. I showed him again my boarding pass and there’s written I can take one carry on bag with my, like every other flight. We’re talking about a small bag with the size 32 cm (length) x 28 cm (height) x 16 cm (width) x 20 cm. Now he changed his mind and said I cannot bring any bag at all with me, not even a carry on bag. Even if it’s written clearly on my boarding pass, but he said it was not in the system and I should pay extra for the carry on bag now and claim the money afterward. In the meantime, there were 30 people passing by with their normal ticket and carry on bag but he didn’t let me go. He kept pushing me to pay for the carry on bag otherwise he wouldn’t let me do the boarding and they would fly without me. Really bad experience! I will book another flight to get back home and never use this airline again.

### "wholeheartedly recommend Volotea"
My wife, 2-year-old daughter, and I had an amazing weekend city trip thanks to the excellent service provided by Volotea. It was our first time flying with this airline, and we were pleasantly surprised by the positive experience. The Volotea staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The check-in process was smooth and efficient. The onboard crew was attentive and went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. Special thanks to the cabin crew for being understanding and patient with our toddler. We were impressed with the cleanliness and overall condition of the aircraft. The seats were comfortable, the onboard catering met our expectations and offered a variety of options. Both the outbound and return flights departed on time. All in all, we wholeheartedly recommend Volotea to anyone looking for a reliable and comfortable airline. Our first experience with Volotea exceeded our expectations, and we look forward to flying with them again in the future. Thank you, Volotea, for contributing to an unforgettable city trip!

### "good value for money"
Volotea is easy to fly: online bookings are simple and the information is clear, Volotea services on the ground and on board are attentive, the staff offers smiles, good value for money. Regarding priority boarding, some airports (for example Florence) are not effectively equipped (but it doesn't depend on Volotea! ): they open the corridor for the priority ticket and then everyone together on the bus which takes you to the plane resulting in a messy climb: at other airports you have 2 separate vans. The only flaw (for us Genoese) is that current flights no longer include Genoa as departure and destination.

### “Exactly on schedule”
Not Verified |  Exactly on schedule, a professional, organized team, friendly and correct. Thanks to the staff, the trip was shorter and more pleasant, so that my wife and I spent the flight easier and faster. At both flight check-ins, there were exceptional employees who made the check-in process easy.

### "recommend for the low prices"
Staff smiling and very kind. The fast baggage check-in, and being able to manage everything from the application is a great plus and very simple. I recommend for the low prices of flights, but the quality of the services and the welcome remain at the top.

### "They were normal flights"
They were normal flights. Punctual. The staff is pleasant and attentive at all times. Much cheaper prices than other companies. For future flights I will keep this company in mind. Fueron vuelos dentro de la normalidad. Puntuales. El personal agradable y atento en todo momento. Precios mucho mas económicos que en otras compañías. Para próximos vuelos tendré muy en cuenta esta compañía.

### "very satisfied with this company"
We travel 4 to 5 times a year with Volotea and we are very satisfied with this company in which we have complete confidence. Various destinations already tested with Volotea: Corsica, Spain, Portugal, Balearic Islands, Corfu, Split… | Nous voyageons 4 à 5 fois par an avec Volotea et nous sommes très satisfaits par cette compagnie en qui nous avons entière confiance. Diverses destinations déjà testées avec Volotea : Corse, Espagne, Portugal, Baléares, Corfou, Split…

### Volotea customer review
My flight with Volotea was comfortable and all the crew very professional and kind, I didn’t care for the Paris Orly ground handling service, but this is not Volotea’s fault.

### “efficient and helpful staff”
Tout à été parfait comme à chaque fois. Départ à l’heure, bon service à l’aéroport et à bord Personnel accueillant et efficace et serviable Je recommande Volotea. - Everything was perfect as always. Departure on time, good service at the airport and on board Welcoming, efficient and helpful staff I recommend Volotea.

### "value for money was great
Boarding was well organized. The Service staff was friendly. Our flight arrived 25 minutes early at its destination. The value for money for this flight was great

### "excellent service"
Excellent trip in Volotea, excellent service and perfect treatment with all the staff, both in the cabin and on the ground, fulfilling the treatment and service very well on time with a few minutes less than expected, without a doubt I will refer the trip to this company. Excelente viaje en la compañía Volotea, servicio excelente y trato perfecto con todo su personal tanto de cabina como de tierra cumpliendo muy bien el trato y servicio en hora con unos minutos menos de lo previsto, sin lugar a dudas remitiré el viaje en esta compañia

### "did very well throughout"
Volotea did very well throughout the entire trip. We're a family with one PRM I can only make one complaint when making the reservation. It was for three people but, as there was a passenger with reduced mobility, Volotea reservation system automatically assigned two seats corresponding to PRM and a companion (the system assigns the passenger who makes the reservation); the third passenger must purchase a seat. It would be great if members of a family of two adults and a PRM child had their seats automatically assigned, but the system did not do so.

### "good attendance onboard"
Very satisfied. Point to point route, smooth boarding, good attendance onboard, reasonable price, friendly and easy website. It is my third time with Volotea and I’m now Megavolotea member.

### "delays on both outbound and inbound flights"
Unreliable service: delays on both outbound and inbound flights. Not even an apology from the cockpit or the cabin crew. Indifferent staff on the ground too. A very complicated web site. Not easy to obtain an invoice! A rough low-cost service at a not necessarily low-cost price. A cheap product in general. Should be avoided unless it's the only option available.

### "Very happy with this company"
Très content de cette compagnie Personnel souriant, départ et arrivée ponctuels et confort tout a fait acceptable. Embarquement efficace et équipage très agréable Bonne découverte. - Very happy with this company. Smiling staff, punctual departure and arrival and completely acceptable comfort. Efficient boarding and very pleasant crew. Good discovery.

### "very good vale for money"
Is the best low cost Airline in Europe for me. Offers a very good vale for money, seat comfort, and cabin staff service. Also punctual flights.

### "my worst flight experience ever"
Inacceptable. The aircraft was the dirtiest inside that I ever seen in over 20 years of flying. When seen the mess and stains on the seat I was getting - I brought to it the attention of a crew member, her answer was «I can’t do anything about, we don’t have a vacuum cleaner, but if the aircraft is not full we can change you seats» when ever came back even tho a full row just behind me was empty. So I had to remove the stains on the seat with a tissue I had, and push all the mess under the seat with my shoes and hand. As if that wasn’t enough two out of four crew members spent most of the flight loudly talking and laughing in the rear of the aircraft instead of working. And the onboard entertainment wasn’t working. So it was my worst flight experience ever.

### "experience is totally positive"
My experience is totally positive. I had questions before the trip that were quickly resolved via WhatsApp. The flight went very well, we left on time, without turbulence and we arrived at our destination ahead of schedule. In my case we checked the suitcases (free) and at pick up time quickly and without problems. The space between the seats is wide and comfortable. The ground and air staff were very friendly, and the pilot was also very nice. Without a doubt we will repeat with them on our next vacation. I have to say that when I returned it was equally satisfactory. Mi experiencia es totalmente positive. Tuve dudas antes del viaje que me solucionaron vía whatsapp rápidamente. El vuelo fue muy bien, salimos a su hora, sin turbulencias y llegamos a destino antes de lo previsto. En mi caso facturamos las maletas (gratis) y a la hora de recoger rápido y sin problemas. El espacio entre los asientos es ancho y cómodo. El personal de tierra y de aire muy amables, y el piloto muy majo también. Sin duda repetiremos con ellos en nuestras próximas vacaciones. He de decir que a la vuelta fue igualmente satisfactoria.

### "Very satisfied"
Very satisfied. Boarding on time from Toulouse and arriving 20 minutes ahead of schedule in Tenerife South. Helpful on-board staff. The same goes for the return from Tenerife to Toulouse. Très satisfait. Embarquement à l'heure depuis Toulouse et arrivée avec 20 min d'avance sur l'horaire prévu à Ténérife Sud. Personnel de bord serviable. Idem pour le retour de Ténérife à Toulouse.

### "appreciated the punctuality of the flights"
Not Verified |  We appreciated the punctuality of the flights and the cleanliness of the cabin. For boarding we have no worries thanks to the MegaVolotéa. We did not use the on-board catering service. The flights were full. Nous avons apprécié la ponctualité des vols et la propreté de la cabine. Pour les embarquements nous n'avons aucun souci grâce au MegaVolotéa. Nous n'avons utilisé les service restauration à bord. Les vols étaient complets.

### "good service during the flight"
Flight with megavolotea program. Priority boarding and cabin bag included. Flight on time, good communication, good service for boarding, good service during the flight, good entertainment service by wifi on board. I recommend. I'll use again.

### "Perfect flight for me"
Perfect flight for me. On time, quick on boarding due to my priority status, nice crew, clear announcements. Comfortably seated, enough room for my cabin luggage.

### "Everything was good"
Not Verified |  Everything was good. Hostesses, airport, plane I loved all about that trip. I got all that I needed. Thanks for this kind of work, have a wonderful time with my wife with Volotea flight

### "No complaints"
Le voyage s'est très bien passé avec du personnel de bord charmant et disponible. Le vol était tranquille. Un peu de retard au départ (20 minutes) mais récupéré à l'arrivée. Rien à redire. - The trip went very well with charming and available on-board staff. The flight was quiet. A little late at departure (20 minutes) but recovered on arrival. No complaints.

### "everything works perfectly"
It was a pleasant flight - everything works perfectly. Check- in personnel was very friendly, boarding was uncomplicated and the crew was in a good mood.

### "Would definitely fly Volotea again"
Excellent boarding and disembarkation procedures. Our baggage was on the belt almost as we arrived at it. The quickest I’ve ever seen. Would definitely fly Volotea again.

### "worst customer service"
Not Verified | The absolute worst airline in the world with the worst customer service. Cancelled our flight (that was delayed 3 times) less than an hour before the flight and offered no help to the passengers. Told everyone to figure it out on their own. Then won't even compensate for new flights that needed to be booked. What a joke.

### "the services are all paid"
Not Verified |  Nice flight, we left on time and arrived at our destination 30 minutes early. On the way back, we left with a slight delay and landed on time, through no fault of the company. Notes against: Bergamo Airport: priority boarding was not checked, they let us all access through the same entrance. Flight services: for members it would be nice to have included at least a glass of water or coffee because the services are all paid. However, if you don't have particular needs as company, it is highly recommended. Volo bello, siamo partiti in orario e siamo arrivati a destinazione con 30 Min. di anticipo. Al ritorno partiti con leggero ritardo e atterrati in orario, non per colpa della compagnia. Note contro: Aeroporto di Bergamo: non sono stati controllati gli imbarchi prioritari, ci hanno fatto accedere tutti dallo stesso ingresso. Servizi di volo: per chi è socio sarebbe bello aver incluso almeno un bicchiere d'acqua o di caffè perche i servizi sono tutti a pagamento. Comunque se non avete particolari esigenze come compagnia e consigliatissima.

### "service onboard was competent and friendly"
The flights were on time. The service onboard was competent and friendly. I subscribed Megavolotea to benefit from the priority boarding which allowed for a smooth boarding and sufficient space for my luggage.

### "discomfort of the seats"
I recently had the unfortunate experience of flying from Madrid to Olbia with Volotea V7 3614. The discomfort of the seats was beyond belief – I could feel the unforgiving metal structure pressing against my back throughout the flight. The front cabin bathroom was out of order, leaving me stranded on a front row seat with a long trek to the back for a restroom. As if that weren't enough, the quality of the drinks, including something as basic as water, was shockingly subpar. I won't be choosing this airline for my future travels.

### "everything was on time"
Good experience and everything was on time. Comfort seats and good space for tall people too. The only thing that can be improved is the variety of choices in the menu for the clients like me that had a meal included in the ticket.

### "I would recommend this airline"
Very good service on the ground and on board. I would recommend this airline. They have a good range of choices in terms of hand baggage or checked in baggage and meals etc

### "I recommend the company"
Perfect trip, comfortable and spacious seats, kind staff, very quiet take-off and landing and punctual boarding and landing times, in the busiest week of August. I recommend the company.

### "flight itself was smooth and punctual"
Recently I had the pleasure of flying with Volotea, a round trip on the route Turin / Paris Orly and I am delighted to share my incredibly positive experience. From start to finish, the entire journey was a testament to their commitment to excellence in air travel. Booking my flight was a breeze, thanks to their user-friendly website and intuitive interface. At the same was the in-flight operation. The cabin crew was attentive, friendly, and displayed a genuine commitment to passenger comfort. The flight itself was smooth and punctual (even making up for the delay accumulated at the airport) In conclusion, I whole heartedly recommend this young company to anyone seeking a nice and cost effective flying experience

### "The trip was on-time"
The trip was on-time landing despite of the slight delay on take-off. Friendly on-board staff. Good communication, clean plane, fast boarding and comfortable seat.

### "my favorite airline"
Volotea is my favorite airline for punctuality of schedules, space between seats, cleanliness on board, flag colors and kindness of the service staff.

### "service on board was excellent"
I highly value punctuality, cleanliness and comfort. The service received on board was excellent. And I want to highlight the kindness of the cabin staff. | Valoro muy positivamente la puntualidad, la limpieza y la comodidad. El servicio recibido a bordo fue excelente. Y quiero resaltar la amabilidad del personal de cabina.

### "flight was on time"
Our flight was on time. Fast boarding procedures. We had MegaVolotea club subscription, very useful to save some money for boarding luggage.

### "flights were perfectly on time"
My family and I were very satisfied. The departure and arrival of both our flights were perfectly on time. The flight and ground attendants were helpful and kind. The aircraft were clean. We had no luggage issues.

### "both flights were on time"
Good experience, both flights were on time (even a bit early), efficient people on the ground & on board It is not always easy to understand the prices and luggage policy, I took the Mega Volotea program and had a good seat on the front of the aircraft and was able to keep my cabin luggage with me + 1 back pack

### "Excellent impression"
My latest experiences with Volotea are extremely positive, I have flown four times between July and August. Punctual and precise company with well presented crew. New aircraft with decent space between seats. Out of 4 flights, I arrived early three times despite flying to/from Catania with a half-service airport due to the well-known fire at Terminal A. Excellent impression! Le mie ultime esperienze con Volotea sono estremamente positive, ho volato quattro volte tra luglio ed agosto. Compagnia puntuale e precisa con personale di bordo che ben si presenta. Aerei nuovi con discreto spazio tra un posto e l'altro. Su 4 voli arrivato in anticipo per ben tre volte pur volando su/da Catania con aeroporto a mezzo servizio per via del noto incendio al Terminal A. Ottima impressione!

### "charge me 35 euros per suitcase"
Not Verified |  I am very happy with the outward trip and not so much with the return trip because they charge me 35 euros per suitcase that they did not charge me for the outbound trip, on the 28th I flew from Bilbao to Seville and the conditions have changed against the traveler. Estoy muy contento con el viaje de ida con el de vuelta no tanto porque me cobran 35 euros por maleta que a ka ida no me cobraron, el día 28 vuelo Bilbao sevilla y han cambiado las condiciones en contra del viajero.

### "The crew was very friendly"
Not Verified |  Travel without significant delays or incidents. The crew was very friendly. On the outward journey the space between seats was a bit limited, on the way back it was better.

### "charged me 60 euro for check-in"
Their website was down and I couldn't do the check-in. At the airport they charged me 60 euro for check-in. At their office, they told me that I have to prove that their website was down.

### "Another good experience"
Another good experience with Volotea. For our 11th flight with the company, we have a little experience and we have never been disappointed. Compared to the prices charged (even more with the MégaVolotea program), the service is more than good. The schedules are sometimes a little off - early in the morning or return late in the evening. The choice departing from Nantes is constantly evolving and growing from year to year. It's a real plus. On board, the staff is correct (depending on the flight) but there is a desire to satisfy the traveller. The ability to track the flight in real time and to be able to watch movies over wi-fi is appreciated. The luggage policy is correct in comparison the the others companies. To resume, I recommend.

### "on time, on quality & on cost"
Booking was easy on the web, then I downloaded the app to register and get the tickets. Multiple options were available to adjust the price to the trip (number of luggage, seat choice etc) At the airport, no surprise, no extra cost Flight was on time even 20min in advance for Toulouse-Dubrovnik but 30 min late for Split - Toulouse. Boarding is very fast as Volotea uses the 2 doors (front & rear). Flight attendant very kind and helpful. Seats are classic economy although they said we could incline them but I didn't manage to do it (may be because we sat at the last row) Very good airline, on time, on quality & on cost

### "Great seat space"
Best low cost airline I have flown with. Great seat space. No frills. Encourages you to use online services and e ticket instead of printing. Easy to check in. Was exactly what I would expect from low cost without compromise on comfort.

### "Courteous and helpful staff"
Punctual flight, clean aircraft, comfortable and well-spaced seats, for the length of the trip, the whole flight lasted less than h1:30. Courteous and helpful staff

### "delighted by this company"
Our trip went very well as always with Volotea. We traveled with our cat Minette and that is why we both had to check in at the airport. We have been Megavolotea for many years, I think 10 years. Welcome, smiling and efficient on-board staff, 1 hour delay but they have caught up 1/4 hour. We will be traveling again with Volotea on August 23, September 25 and October 27, 2023. We travel with them at least 4 times a year and we are delighted by this company that I recommend to all our friends and those around us. Notre voyage s’est très bien déroulé comme à chaque fois avec Volotea. Nous avons voyagé avec notre chat Minette et c’est pour cela que nous avons dû nous enregistrer tous les 2 à l’aéroport. Malheureusement j’ai jeté les 2 cartes d’embarquement et je ne peux pas en avoir d’autres via le site Volotea. Nous sommes Megavolotea depuis de nombreuses années, je pense 10 ans. Accueil, personnel à bord souriant et efficace, retard de 1h mais ils ont rattrapé 1/4h, Nous allons à nouveau voyager avec Volotea le 23 août, le 25 septembre et le 27 octobre 2023. Nous voyageons avec eux au minimum 4 fois par an et nous sommes ravis par cette compagnie que je conseille à tous nos amis et à notre entourage.

### "very good and priceworthy flight"
It was a very good and priceworthy flight. The aircraft departed on time and arrived at Athens airport even before the scheduled time. The staff was very kind.

### "everything went well"
From Eleutherios Venizelos Airport in Athens to Cagliari everything went well. Only from Cagliari Elmas Airport to Athens we had some delay for boarding about 15 minutes I think. We had already receive a SMS for that.

### "Volotea cut corners at every turn"
Our flight was delayed for 3+ hours. Pilot told us that a technical fault required a new plane to be flown in from France. This technical fault meant that everyone on board was owed €400 in compensation from Volotea due to EU261 regulations (Volotea didn't tell us this, which they are meant to). When I claimed my refund, Volotea declined and changed their whole story, saying the delay was due to strikes in France, meaning they didn't have to pay. I reported Volotea to AESA (Spanish Aviation Safety and Security Agency) for lying to avoid their legal requirement to reimburse passengers due to a extended delay. AESA opened an investigation last month and found that Volotea did lie to us. They have since paid the EU261 compensation. TL;DR - Volotea cut corners at every turn. They broke multiple rules regarding flight delays and then lied about it to authorities later. Avoid flying with them if possible.

### "Cabin crew were very nice"
Very nice flight with the Pilot explained us the route, and it was interesting. Cabin crew were very nice. Priority boarding is a nice advantage, it is more quickly at airport.

### "customer service is useless"
Not Verified |  They pretty much don’t have a customer service. Luckily I have found a number online to speak with someone from the company but their time is from 9am to 2pm and from 5pm to 7pm. We had a cancellation communicated to us only 10 hours before the expected leaving time, and there was no way to speak with someone because it was around 10pm. And they don’t work at 10pm. We only received a message with no details and a faulty link. The day after we were finally able to speak with someone at 9am and the only option served to us was a refund. We had to book another flight 3 times more expensive at our own expenses. The customer service is useless, unprofessional and if you want to speak with their manager the answer will be ‘the manager doesn’t have headphones’ Just one word, ridiculous.

### "I never had a problem"
I can book my in cabin pets online. It is a no frills low cost airline but they have orderly check in, update information about flights via text message and even in unforseen situations like bad weather or national strike, they kept us well informed. I’ve been flying Volotea for years now and I never had a problem. Sure flights can be delayed (Pantelleria is a very windy destinations and sometimes we can’t land) but Volotea tries hard to get us there on time whenever possible.

### "The flight was on time"
The flight was on time from Heraklion to Athens, also the flight Athens to Heraklion 12/07/2023 was also on time something that is very important for me. Another thing that was interesting is that for the low cost airline I had some space between my knees and the front seat.

### "the seats are comfortable"
Punctuality on the way out and on the way back. Easy to buy tickets through the company's website. As well as when checking. The treatment of the company's employees is excellent. The space available between the seats is quite wide, and the seats are comfortable. I hope to fly with this airline again.

### "Comfortable seats, plenty of legroom"
Comfortable seats, plenty of legroom, fast boarding, no long wait at the gate. The landing was imperceptible and fast. Excellent value for money and quality. The check-in was made on the phone in advance and they easily passed the check-in at the airport. It was nice to get all the seats next to the children in advance, during the purchase of tickets and sat with the children together and this did not require any additional payment.

### "Very nice experience"
Very nice experience, flight on time! Boarding was very fast, we arrived 10 minutes before the expected time. I would like to fly with Volotea more Times.

### "service on board very appreciable"
Contrary to what I have read, the Volotea flights taken have been very punctual. The welcome and the service on board very appreciable, I highly recommend. Contrairement à ce que j'ai pu lire , les vols Volotea pris ont été très ponctuels . L'accueil et le service à bord très appréciable, je recommande vivement

### "pay €400 in total to carry our bags"
We flew from Athens to Mykonos and the way back to Athens on June 2023. We have tried to add bags via Volotea’s website and app for both flights but the system was not working / not allowing us to complete the purchase. We have tried then to contact via e-mail and phone their client attention service and have just received general / protocol replies. No human interaction existed. We had to pay €400 in total to carry our bags, while buying them online would cost only a fraction of that. A real extortion, we were left with no option. The worst service I have ever received from an airline.

### "turns into a 4.5 hour flight"
Not Verified |  They made us wait 30 minutes without informing why there is a delay. Ac wasn't on and the attendants told us nothing. Not even water was provided. Later, they announced there is a problem with the light of the plane and will need to change aircrafts at Venice. Now a 2.5hour flight turns into a 4.5 hour flight.

### "Not so budget as it seems"
Not Verified |  Not so budget as it seems. Do not choose this for a backpack travel type of journey. Do not get surprised if you choose this airline for a budget option and get scammed like I did. Upon my registration I was offered with a 15 days membership trial which offered me extra luggage and priority boarding. This membership allowed me to bring a 10kg backpack and a side bag (tote bag) on the plane which was also included on my verification email of the purchase. However my flight was after the mentioned 15 days of trial. Upon the boarding they charged me for my tote bag referring for the expired membership. I had two option either I pay for the membership for a whole year (obviously they don’t have a membership for a month) or I pay for my extra luggage. First option cost me 60€ the second would have been 65€ so now I have a membership that I don’t use for a whole year.

### "The walker never arrived to Verona"
My mother has reduced mobility and has to use a walker. At the check-in in Barcelona the staff told us that we have to check it. The walker never arrived to Verona. Ok, it can happen. What can not happen is that, the Volotea staff told my mother that, once the walker will arrive to Verona, she has to go and take it (she lives 100km far from the airport) because they don't send anything. (I live in Spain by the way, so I don't know how she would be able to go and take it.) Should I add anything else?

### "Very good journey"
Very good journey, both legs on time. Volotea's A320's have a reasonable seat pitch. Nice cleaning conditions. The onboard service is chargeable, as all low-cost, perhaps could be good that standard drinks like water, tea or coffee could be free of charge. They make the effort to speak native language of both destinations. Crews are quite friendly, professional as well. Personally I would like to get more information from the tech crew at the flight start, en-route, and before landing. Overall good experience.

### "Very pleasant flight"
Not Verified |  Very pleasant flight and nice plane, comfortable seats and very smart and polite staff onboard. Staff at Turin airport wasn't very helpful, sometimes it does happen but when I asked at the lady over the counter an information about my boarding pass she replied you have the information in the line at the bottom end, she was also in a hurry maybe for onboarding passengers but I didn't expect such a reply. At the end plane arrived half hour earlier so wasn't bad at all

### "polite and helpful cabin crew"
What I find pleasing about Volotea is above aii the reasonably priced tickets coupled with the polite and helpful cabin crew makes this airline my first choice. Moreover, allowing a small hand bag besides the cabin suitcase makes it easier to access my documents, cell phone etc..

### "forced to check our bags"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever with an inexperienced crew. Started with a 40 minute delay in which they had us wait on the gangway. They then forced us to check our bags instead of letting us put them sideways in the overhead bins which customers on our flight did, claiming the flight was full and that they needed the room. At the end of boarding there were at least five empty overhead bins that could have easily accommodated our bags. We were the only ones forced to check our bags.

### "happy with my trips with Volotea"
Always so happy with my trips with Volotea, which is a safe company at reasonable prices. I have always been loyal to the Megavolotea tariff and it is perfect. Toujours aussi contente de mes voyages avec Volotea, qui est une compagnie sûre à tarifs raisonnables. Je suis fidèle au tarif Megavolotea depuis toujours et c’est parfait

### "crew are very friendly"
The flight has been perfect, the crew are very friendly and the cleaning is great, as well as no waiting. The flights have been quite enjoyable, also with the Wi-Fi on board, you can be entertained. El vuelo ha sido perfecto,los tripulantes muy amables y la limpieza estupenda,además de sin esperas . Yan sido los vuelos bastante amenos,además con el wifi a bordo,puedes estar entretenido

### "Our flight went very well"
Our flight from Bordeaux to Olbia in Sardinia went very well with Volotea, we had no checked baggage, we were subscribed to megavolotea and were able to bring a cabin suitcase + a backpack. Just a little 30 min delay from Bordeaux but almost caught up on arrival. Notre vol de Bordeaux à Olbia en Sardaigne s'est très bien passé sur la compagnie Volotea, nous n'avions pas de bagages en soutes , nous étions abonnés à mégavolotea et avons pu emmener une valise cabine + un sac à dos. Juste un petit retard de 30 min au départ de Bordeaux mais presque rattrapé à l'arrivée.

### "They rearranged the flight"
They rearranged the flight, 2 hours delay but didn't send any notifications (of course we submit e mail and phone number for notifications). We went at the airport, waited 4 hours. No support at all, they gave us a number, working hours only. Ehat a terrible way to begin your journey. Never again

### "Quality low cost company"
Quality low cost company, traveler taken into consideration, comfortable seats sufficient for large sizes, multilingual and pleasant on-board staff. Compagnie Low cost de qualité, voyageur pris en considération, sièges confortables places suffisantes pour les grandes tailles, personnel de bord multilingue et agréable

### "Very punctual, fast flight"
Very punctual, fast flight which went very well at all levels (reception, on-board services, on-board staff). I have been traveling with this company for 3 years. Only one big delay, but announced and information given in the application. Often attractive prices, ease of booking and a very interesting loyalty card when you travel regularly

### "good first experience"
Very good first experience with Volotea and we are delighted we were very surprised by the professionalism and the quality of the reception before and during the flight have to say it was perfect

### "I recommend this company"
Always happy to travel with Volotea. We have traveled 4 times in 2022 and probably 4 times in 2023 since 2012… We have been Megavolotea for years and we benefit from attractive prices. For this flight, we traveled with our cat as in May and September 2022. Top crew on departure and in the cabin. Always smiling and caring during the flights. I recommend this company in which I have complete confidence. Toujours ravis de voyager avec Volotea. Nous avons voyagé 4 fois en 2022 et sans doute 4 fois en 2023 et ce, depuis 2012… Nous sommes Megavolotea depuis des années et nous bénéficions de tarifs attractifs. Pour ce vol, nous avons voyagé avec notre chat tout comme en mai et septembre 2022. Équipage top au départ et en cabine. Toujours souriants et aux petits soins pendant les vols. Je recommande cette compagnie en qui j’ai entièrement confiance.

### "it is essentially impossible to speak with anybody"
Not Verified |  I am not complaining about the flight (though the ticket was quite expensive). My complaint is about the MegaVolotea programme. I have never asked to joining such programme, which is totaly useless for me. However, yesterday I received an e-mail from Volotea saying that I was now part of the programme and that Volotea had taken the annual fee, 59.99 Euro, from my credit card!! All this without any previous communication or, at least, a request to confirm it. I tried to contact Volotea to clarify the matter....it is essentially impossible to speak with anybody, their sort of AI Virtual Assistant is a no go. I tried to contact them over the phone (very well hidden number but I found one), and nobody replies. I sent a few e-mails to all the Volotea addresses I could find, but no answer. Unspeakable behaviour. My advice is to steer well away from such Company and never give them your credit card number.

### "A very good experience"
A very good experience in terms of punctuality. We needed info about boarding the cabin trolley and wrote an e-mail. The Volotea team answered in a few hours. At the end also in the Lourdes airport the Volotea team helped me boarding the cabin trolley.

### "flight was on time"
The flight was on time, and the aircraft clean. The flight crew was very friendly. The Megavolotea program is useful to save money.

### Volotea customer review
I have always had a very good experience without delays and good experience on board. The megavolotea membership offers other advantages such as being able to carry the suitcase in the cabin, lowest prices. Regarding the experience on board, they offer music, series, movies, and books on the plane's internal network and this makes the trip much more enjoyable.

### "I recommend this airline"
All was good. I recommend this airline. Airplane is quite new, seats are comfortable. Timing is good. Personal is friendly. Overall I am satisfied with the service

### "friendly staff"
Very good flight, punctuality of the schedule respected - clean plane - friendly staff - correct information during the flight - correct plane comfort - correct boarding and disembarking

### "my favourite airline"
Surely my favourite airline company among the so called “low cost”. Honest and friendly commercial politics (luggage, tickets). No tricks, no hidden costs. Easy App.

### "onboard service is excellent"
Despite the difficult strike period, I left on the day and at the appointed time. And on the way back even 10 minutes early. I only travel with volotea, the onboard service is excellent, the staff friendly, the planes clean. Malgré la période difficile de grève, je suis parti le jour et à l'heure dite.Et au retour même 10 minutes d'avance. Je ne voyage qu'avec volotea le service de bord est excellent, le personnel sympathique les avions propre.

### "Good flight, nice hostesses"
Good flight, nice hostesses, the outbound flight arrived earlier than the scheduled time and on the way back, although we left later than the scheduled time, we arrived on time. we had a smooth ride. Buen vuelo, azafatas agradables, el vuelo de ida fue la llegada más pronto de la hora marcada y a la vuelta aunque salimos más tarde de la hora prevista llegamos en hora . Tuvimos un viaje tranquilo

### "flight went very well"
The flight went very well. The crew on board was attentive. The price of the flight was not expensive. Very good experience. 4th flight on Volotea without problem.

### "Friendly crew, clean cabin"
Friendly crew, clean cabin, flight on time. Aircraft was the newest in fleet (9 years old), good communications from the flight deck. Food and drinks ok.

### "Very good flight"
Very good flight. Cabin crew were very attentioned. Priority boarding was a good advantage. We can follow this flight with Volotea wifi on board.

### "Everything on time"
Everything on time and staff nice. Quick boarding. Emails sent for advising about boarding cards and process at the airport.

### "Great experience"
Great experience with this low cost airline. The staff is very helpful and they do not annoy selling whatever they can.

### "Very pleasant flight"
Very pleasant flight, in-flight staff is nice and smiling. The planes and seats are clean and quite comfortable (I am 1.70m high). I subscribe to the mega volotea program as it offers 10kg by person.

### "I am quite happy with it"
Take off on time and landing 20 minutes ahead of schedule. Flight attendants are nice and professional. The check in in Tenerife went OK but the boarding was a bit messy. There was some waiting time at the luggage delivery at Bordeaux Airport. But overall it was my first experience with Volotea and I am quite happy with it.

### "Friendly cabin crew"
Boarding done in advance. Perfect trip and early arrival. Friendly cabin crew. Captain who communicates throughout the flight. Excellent service, I recommend! Embarquement réalisé en avance. Voyage parfait et arrivée en avance. Personnel de cabine bienveillant. Commandant de bord qui communique tout au long du vol. Excellente prestation, je recommande !

### "Perfect management of the troubles"
Foggy day in Ancona so take off was delayed. Prompt information was given by airline, even to smartphone. Landing in Ancona was impossible so the flight has been directed to Pescara (about 200 km to south. Kind and quick assistance and use of coach to reach Ancona. Perfect management of the troubles by the company.

### "recommend Volotea on this route"
Great flight on January 1st 2023. The staff was welcoming, helpful, and in a good mood on board. The pilot gave us information during the flight, and the flight landed in Nantes on time, though we had departed about 30 minutes late from TFS. We didn't have any food or snacks but bought drinks which were normally priced. I highly recommend Volotea on this route.

### "I am very satisfied"
Flight on time, arrived even with 20 min advance. Everything was well organised, from the luggage deposit to the end of the flight. I am very satisfied.

### "One of the best low cost airlines"
One of the best low cost airlines. Punctuality, good service and tranquility during the flight. If you want to buy you have QR, there is music during the flight. Spanish airline, with a good price, quality and excellent service. I would travel with Volotea again. If you have questions or problems, they have a chat where you can answer questions.

### "a second very pleasant experience"
This was our second time flying with Volotea and a second very pleasant experience for the whole family, from the start of the booking process until our return home. I myself fly quite frequently and I find Volotea among one of the best airlines that I have flown with so far, booking of flights is done fast, the price is clear and there are no hidden costs or unnecessary extra charges. The process before the flight is very user-friendly. This time we also had some questions about luggage policy (just needed a confirmation that every passenger can have his own suitcase) and I sent an inquiry to their Client team and got an answer within the promised 3-days period. As for our departing and returning flight - whole process (check-in of passengers and luggage, boarding) went smoothly and what I liked the most was that the flights were punctual by their departures (no delays, which is a very positive surprise lately) and the arrivals to both destinations were also even ahead of schedule! Another example of good practice that Volotea uses and that I find very useful is by deboarding when they invite passengers to stay seated and only to leave their seats and the plane progressively (usually when a plane lands, all passengers stand up and then wait crowded for dismemberment, by Volotea, flight attendants announced in advance that passengers should stay in their seats, and then - when everything was ready (hand luggage, connection to the terminal established or stairs and buses outside ready) - they called four rows in a row to disembark and by that avoid unnecessary crowding.

### Volotea customer review
Not Verified |  Not as bad as I was dreading. Booked ‘priority boarding’ and the whole package and it was a bit weird that they came out, quickly served us a Kit-Kat and a packet of almonds and then disappeared without a glance at anyone else. Despite the strenuous written restrictions on baggage dimensions and weight, which I had been very cautious about, everyone else appeared to be on the Silk Road and were all bringing the contents of a small store on board. However, as it was, on this occasion, a fairly innocuous experience. Very much could do without having to download the app or print out boarding passes (who can print when on the road, seriously), or pay an extra 30 euros per person for the privilege of having them go through the onerous business – all that stuff and the moveable feast that is the baggage restriction really leave a bad taste. The organisation’s principles seemed both grasping and chaotic, but the implementation fairly smooth. Would neither recommend nor particularly caution against.

### "charged $60 for late check in"
Horrible airline. We were unable to check in due to our phones not working in Athens (not uncommon if you are not from there) so we got to the airport over three hours before our flight. Volotea has a strict policy that you have to check in two hours prior so we made sure to get there well in advance. Well no employee from Volotea showed up to the airport to work the counter until an hour and a half before the flight. We were charged $60 for late check in. The employee at the airport apologized and told us to email Volotea for a refund. Of course now they are refusing to process any type of refund. Very unfair. Horrible customer service. Not worth the “cheap” tickets

### "Beware of Volotea and Trip.com"
Booked roundtrip airfare Athens to Santorini on Trip.com. To Santorini On Volotea Airlines, same day return on Agean Sir. Arrived at Volotea counter at 4:00 am for our 6:00 am flight. The agent arrived at 4:12 am. Collected our passports (3), and ticket confirmation provided by Trip.com checked her computer then said we must pay $30.00 each total $90.00 to fly because we did not check in online. When we said we were not told we must check in online she said that Trip.com should have told us and to call them though we did not have international phone or Internet (US residents). I said I would do the online check in having accessed airport Internet. She said it was too late at 4:25 am to complete it, it was “closed” because it had to be done at least 3 hours before flight. When I asked for a supervisor she said no, then suddenly her English was not so good. In addition to the $258.00 already paid for the round trip fare, we had prepaid an excursion for an additional $300.00. We were forced to pay the additional $90.00 or lose $550.00. On our return from Santorini airport I asked the Airport agent if we had to pay an additional fee for our return to Athens (on Agean). She looked at our printed ticket information and with a knowing look snd said “no, that’s only them, you won’t have any problems”, and I didn’t. Beware of Volotea and Trip.com who when I called and explained the situation said it was the buyer’s responsibility to go to the airline site and find out their rules. There is no such statement on their site and the agent could not provide anything in writing to that effect. Horrible people, both.

### "a 30 Euro voucher to say my flight was great"
Volotea is offering me a 30 Euro voucher to say my flight was great. It was a great flight. I do find their website very confusing because  wasn't sure that kind of membership I had to pay for or what it would get me. I would fly with them again.

### Volotea customer review
It was my first time travelling with Volotea, the best airline that I have travelled with. Every step of the checking process went smoothly, the staff was very professional and kind. The boarding was fast and organized, and the flight attendants were very skilled. We arrived at our destination several minutes before the expected arrival time. I definitely recommend it.

### "30 euro to check you in"
Don’t be fooled by Volotea’s low prices. They stick it to you at the check in counter: 30 euro to check you in, 50 euro to check in one piece of luggage. Having purchased priority boarding, at Mykonos airport, we were checked in at the gate first only to then wait on the tarmac with all other passengers for 15 minutes. Felt like a herd.

### "I recommend this company"
I decided to subscribe to the Megavolotea program for its discounts and facilities. I usually travel to Seville for visiting my family, And Volotea has direct flight from Bilbao to Seville. The cabin crew and ground staff are very friendly and very helpful. Being a Megavolotea they offer you the possibility of checking your luggage for free. I found the app very useful to do the online check in. The planes I´ve flown are relatively new, clean and the seats were spacious. Our flight suffered a schedule change and we were notified several weeks before. I recommend this company.

### "better than Ryanair"
In general, Volotea is a good airline. Every time I've flown with them everything has been correct - no delays, planes are comfortable and somewhat clean, crew is generally polite and nice. However, there are downsides as in customer service - this last time I've flown with them, I checked in my luggage at the counter and it arrived with a bit of the zip open - no one would actually give me a coherent answer to my claim, I was left in the hands of automatic responses, etc. Another time, having purchased my seat, I was asked to change it because they - or their algorithm - had seated separately a mother and a toddler. I said I wouldn't change it before boarding as I had paid. To my surprise, a flight attendant confronted me once again onboard, when all passengers had already been sat. That is plain rude and, once again, never got a proper answer after having filled in a complaints form). To sum up, Volotea is better than Ryanair,  but they still need to improve many things. Will keep flying with them though.

### "Excellent value for money"
We traveled with Volotea in September from Olbia to Milan. Easy and fast buying procees on their website, helpful on-board staff, clean aircraft. Travelling with a newborn allowed us to get free priority boarding and hand luggage: really appreciated. We will recomend it and continue to fly with Volotea. Excellent value for money.

### "flight staff friendly"
All the services we used were excellent, the flight staff friendly and the trips on time. If i make a criticism we were not satisfied with not being able to buy a seat close for me it is my fiancé as we traveled a pet on board. this thing hurt us a little bit because pet management would have been better if we could have bought nearby seats. Instead due to a system problem and since we were obliged to check in at the airport to bring the dog with us, it was not possible to buy any seats.

### "very little legroom"
Good flight, no problem. Luckily the flight was 45 minutes late, as our boat between Cyclades and Athens had delayed its schedule and was 30 minutes late. Without this delay you would have missed the flight. However, very little legroom. As "Priority" passengers, we would have liked to be treated differently from other passengers: a seat close to the exits to leave quickly on arrival, or a seat at the level of the emergency exits to have more legroom (we are very large), or the luggage that comes out first. Please think about it to better consider those who travel frequently with Volotea. Bon vol, aucun problème. Heureusement le vol avait 45 minutes de retard, car notre bateau entre les Cyclades et Athenes avait retardé son horaire et avait 30 minutes de retard. Sans ce retard vous aurions raté le vol. Par contre très peu de place pour les jambes. En tant que "Priority" nous aurions aimé être traité différemment des autres passagers: un siège proche des sorties pour partir vite à l'arrivée, ou un siège au niveau des sorties de secours pour avoir plus d'espace aux jambes (nous sommes très grands), ou les bagages qui sortent en premiers... Merci d'y penser pour mieux considérer ceux qui voyagent fréquemment avec Volotea.

### "Everything went well"
I traveled with Volotea in August, with a trip to Zakynthos and back to Venice. Everything went well, punctual departure and quiet trip. I will go back to Volotea for any other trips.

### "very good quality versus price"
Not Verified | Verona to Ibiza. Perfect flight, perfect take-off and landing without a thing or anything else. Unfortunately the flight was delayed by an hour due to staff strikes in Ibiza but the captain kept us informed every 15 minutes apologizing. I will continue to fly with Volotea - very good quality versus price!

### "Kind and helpful on-board staff"
The flight left on time from Venice and arrived on time. Kind and helpful on-board staff. The return trip was also ok and on time. The aircraft was clean and welcoming. A great trip to a special destination such as Lourdes!

### "Great experience"
The whole process was excellent. Buying tickets online is quick and I got the boarding passes well in advance. I could choose seats for free. The flights were punctual. Both the ground and the flight staff were very kind. The plane with spacious seats. Great experience indeed. And the flight was very cheap!

### " I have no complaints"
I made the round trip Asturias to Málaga. I am a member of Volotea and I have a series of discounts. It is very easy to travel with this company, established in Asturias, both when searching for flights and when checking-in. The ground crew is very friendly and the cabin crew. We went in emergency exit seats and the space is very wide. I have no complaints.

### "Pleasant flight with no delays"
Pleasant flight with no delays. Standard service on board. As a low cost airline you have to print your boarding pass at home and pay for meals on the plane. Aircraft was comfortable and not very old. Prices for this route with this airline are affordable My experience with this flight was very satisfactory. I recommend this airline..

### "not enough space between these seats"
On both ways, we had the last seat on the planes 26A, 26B, 26C, and 26D. These seats do not have any window and there is not enough space between these seats and the front seat. We had a baby with us who was sitting on the legs of his mother. That was scary because the free space between the baby and the front seat was less than a hand palm. We didn't have an extra scale for the back seats. There was only one scale at the front of the Airplane. My husband forgot his Polo Ralf Lauren hat which he placed on his seat. He realized it immediately when we were on the bus on the way from the plane to the arrivals. Because it was late and with the baby, it was difficult to go back to get it, so I called the next morning the lost and found department of Volotea in order to inform me how I can get the hat. The answer was that nothing was delivered to them and to call again the next day which I did but again the answer was negative. No hat has been found.

### "The worst experience ever"
The worst experience ever. Absolutely unclear policy makes you pay more and more for everything. Ok we paid 180 for priority boarding so it was not low-cost a all. At the end while making check-in on-line, message appeared that we have to do checkin at the airport because of hand luggage which can not travel on the board. It was not possible to checkin without buying the seat, even though in the terms of conditions is written that should be possible within 4 days before flight. So we arrived to the airport according to the instructions and they told us that there is no more seats in the airplane. Ok, overbooking is legal, but to force people to do check-in at the airport and then decline the seat is not. In addition it was not possible to contact them in any way. Super expensive and super shitty

### "Worst company I have flown with"
Worst company I have flown with. Just avoid it at any cost. It’s a lot better to pay more for another company. Once they cancelled a flight a week before our journey to Santorini Greece September 2021 and they didn’t refund anything. Just like that and the mails said that we will give you refund etc and nothing ever happened. But we said okay it was just bad luck or a coincidence. And also there were no other flights the days we wanted so it was a dead end. Now we have booked priority in order to have our carry on with us. We saw the tickets and they told us we cannot have our carry on with us. We show them that it says here we are allowed to have 10kg bag per person and everything that is written in the ticket and they just answered us that these are general information, but they say for my journey the times the airplane door etc everything. We show them the confirmation mail that says we have priority etc and they told us in our system it doesn’t say so. And we just paid again for what we had already paid.

### "check-in to cost an extra 30€ per person"
They will rip you off left and right for nothing! No way is it acceptable for check-in to cost an extra 30€ per person! Unbelievable, basically paid for air.

### "cabin luggage policy is disappointing"
Volotea is a nice low-cost company, prices are low and attractive. Planes are generally on time and quite clean. On board personnel is nice but on flights inside France they often don't speak French very well. The new cabin luggage policy is disappointing, all is done so that customer pay more and more.

### "be more friendly with the passengers"
Some ladies of the staff from the land of the airport of Oviedo had to be more friendly with the passengers, I had to suffer the bad ones. walking along the landing strip doesn't seem good to me, sometimes it's cold and it llueve, the same thing happens when the plane is the last day of the day. Until now I am very satisfied with the timetable and timetables of Volotea, on the other hand to the Megavolotea plus partners, I believe that they would allow us to withdraw the departure boarding cards and immediate departure and not have to wait 4 days before departure you have to pay a supplement for choosing seats and then they allow us to withdraw the cards ... in the whole it is refunded. Algunas señoritas del personal de tierra del aeropuerto de Oviedo deberían de ser más amables con los pasajeros, he tenido que sufrir los malos.modos de alguna de ellas, por otra parte embarcar a las 630 a.m. andando por la pista de aterrizaje no me parece bien, a veces hace frío y llueve, lo mismo si el avión es el último del día....nos dejan en la pista. Hasta ahora estoy muy satisfecho con la puntualidad y horarios de Volotea, por otra parte a los socios Megavolotea plus, creo que nos deberían de permitir sacar las tarjetas de embarque de ida y vuelta de inmediato y no tener que esperar 4 días antes de la salida del vuelo o tener que pagar un suplemento por elegir asientos y así nos permiten sacar las tarjetas.....no todo es recaudar.

### "Avoid at any cost"
Avoid at any cost. Charge plenty of additional fees at check-in that you will not be able to avoid as webpage is not working properly. Better alternatives are available for the same route.

### "They are refusing to reimburse us"
Not Verified |  Volotea was delayed leaving our departure island and we almost missed our international connection. During the transfer they also lost our luggage. They are refusing to reimburse us due to not talking to someone at the airport. The airport at which we had 20 minutes to make it to our international flight home. To recap: Volotea was delayed, almost making us miss our connection. Next, Volotea loses our bags. Then, Volotea refuses to reimburse us anything for our lost bags because we didn't have the time to file a claim at the airport.

### "Do not recommend"
Broken luggage (airport's fault). Broken website (login doesn't work, links don't work, online forms don't work). Broken phone customer service (I called the greek number, they answer in French). Broken email customer service (automated reply is not working properly with no info, they reply after a week by saying they can't assist me). Do not recommend.

### "flights are always overbooked"
Not Verified | Barcelona to Lille. This was my third time flying with Volotea, and the only reason I decided to fly with them again after my previous experiences was because it was the only airline covering the route I needed. The first time I flew with Volotea everything went well. However, the second time I was not able to check in online previous to my flight. I went to the check in counter and they told me the flight was overbooked, so I got a ticket with no seat number, and they asked me to go to the boarding gate, along with 4 other people, and check if there were any available seats at the plane, giving us no guarantee at all that we would be able to fly. This time (third time), I tried to check in online 4 days before my flight (when online check in opens), and I tried several times. I always got a message saying that online check in was not available for my flight, and that I had to go to the check in desk in order to get my seat number. I called Volotea's customer support, and I contacted them on WhatsApp as well. They told me I had randomly been chosen to check in at the airport, as the webpage was overloaded (apparently it is always overloaded, as I am never able to check in online whenever I have booked flights with them). I told them about my previous experience, and said I wanted to check in online before going to the airport, but they told me they could not help me, and they said I had to go to the airport 2 hours in advance. I also asked them if the flight was overbooked, and they said they could not give me that information. I went to the airport 2h30min in advance before my flight to make sure I got a seat, being one of the first passengers to queue at the check in desks. The crew was very rude and they told me the flight was overbooked (again! ), and that I did not have an allocated seat, so I had to go to the boarding gate with my standby ticket and see if there was a free seat for me. I complained and said it was not possible for me to check in online before the flight, customer support had told me I would get my allocated seat once I got to the airport 2 hours in advance, and even though I went even earlier, I did not get a seat nor a solution. I insisted I wanted to get a seat, but the people at the counter told me to either take the standby ticket or leave, as they would not give me a seat at the plane. At the boarding gate, I found out it was 4 of us again waiting to see whether or not we would be able to fly. We finally got a seat, and there were even several empty seats at the plane. I do not understand whether they do this systematically on purpose to make people suffer, or whether their flights are always overbooked. In that case, as many other (more serious) companies do, they should ask for volunteers who want to take a later flight or travel on another day, but I do not think it is normal for a company to decline the online check in for several passengers (they decide who), and even though I tried to do everything that I could to get my seat in advance, nothing worked, as I was already on their overbooking list. I have a Megavolotea membership, for which I pay yearly, but I do not really get the point of having a "loyalty programme" if they do not know how to treat their clients. I am very disappointed and would not recommend anybody to travel with Volotea. I travel a lot, and this is really the worst airline I have ever flown with.

### "cabin staff are not composed"
Compared to every other airline I have used-even low cost ones-this one is the least good one. You pay for priority, but there's no priority, everyone just boards. You pay for food-but the first flight they gave us a kitkat and the second time nothing. The cabin staff are not composed, disciplined and focused. One of the flights had a slight delayed boarding. There were some positives though: Flights were smooth and on the second one even though we had delayed boarding, we arrived earlier than we were supposed to. Plane was clean. There was air WiFi service for their site with free media

### "Worst customer service"
This airline is worse than any airline I have ever used. Worst customer service. They charge for everything. 60 euros for not checking in online and 50 euros for each bag. Just outrageous. I am completely disgusted by this airline. I would never do myself such disservice by throwing away my money. Zero communication topped with robbery. Airline is not reliable. The plane was significantly delayed.

### "provide no after sales service"
Not Verified |  Terrible company. I was forced due to a family medical emergency to cancel my flight. Volotea remained steadfastly uncontactable with circular website links and useless Chatbot's in the help centre. I was unable to contact anyone to cancel my flight. I even tried to alert Aegean Air, the carrier Volotea used for the flight but they would not help stating I had to contact Volotea who remained uncontactable. No email, no phone number, nothing. They will take your money fast enough but provide no after sales service whatsoever.

### "This was so far the worst experience"
This was so far the worst experience my husband and I had with an airline! We were on our honeymoon and customer service ruined the whole trip vibes. Due to their overbooking nonsense law, we were informed on the spot while checking in that one of us might not get a seat on the plane. I was put on the waiting list. We called customer service and all what they said was: "we cannot do anything for you". Imagine being on your honeymoon and just not get a seat on the plane. It was a 2 hours flight during lunch time and no food was served.

### "never fly with them again"
The company forces people to pay extra money to acquire their boarding passes during Check In. They claim if do online check in 48 hrs hours its free, the app and website were malfunctioning and I wasn't able. 2 hours before flight the check in Gate was full of people complaining for the same issue. When I complained to the personel of the airline they told me they haven't been paid and work overtime too. The flight was horrible. I will never fly with them again.

### "worst company I have experienced"
Not Verified |  Volotea is definitely the worst company I have experienced. They do not respect any certain policies and they will make your online check in an awful experience! They will continuously want you to not only pay for priority but also to choose a seat otherwise there will not give you the opportunity to check-in online and instead you will need to pay much more money in the airport! You will need to pay at least 50-70 euros additional anyway and there is no way out.

### "disposing of your time and plans as they wish"
Not Verified |  Brest to Nice. At the moment of buying my ticket online, Volotea automatically (and silently) booked me a yearly subscription for this so-called "Megavolotea" service without any clear indication that I had to pay an extra fee additionally from my concrete flight. As avid scammers that they are, they don't highlight this fact clearly for you to realize on time and they also don't generate any cost breakdown nor any receipt for you with a global total of your transaction after you pay. You only realize that you were tricked until days later, when they book 49.99Eur from your account and then you may realize what goes on (because they don't actually send you any message about this, you have to check your banking history and start to wonder): they concealed that they deceivingly hooked a trial for a yearly subscription on your name at the moment of booking your flight so you cannot cancel it on time. Added to this, two hours before my fight departed, I find out at the check-in stand that my seat was given to someone else deliberately and that the flight is full (I had already paid for my seat several days before!). Other 5 people in that plane were in the same situation as me. I had tried to check-in online several hours before but I couldn't get my boarding pass for some reason: probably they already knew what they had done but decided to give me no notice in advance but wait that I was waiting at the airport. I had to cross the fingers that there was a non-present passenger to be able to take my flight. This is the kind of treatment after I had to pay for their special "Megavolotea" plan. How is it legal that they can decide to steal at any point the seat that you already paid them? you then have to bear alone the risk of being forced to travel on another day, on another plane, or to remain in a given city for an unknown time lapse? All because they want to make more money at your expenses, disposing of your time and plans as they wish. Sneaky scammers with no respect for their clients, only caring about profit. Never again!

### "asked us to pay an extra €50 per luggage"
The worst experience ever, we bought our tickets and have included a carry on luggage of 10kg for each person 4 of us. When arriving at the gate after the flight was delayed for over an hour and a half they asked us to pay an extra €50 per luggage even though We already had paid at the initial purchase saying it had to be checked in and that it was now too late to check in since the counter was now closed. Many passengers was asked to pay pay this amount it was a real scam.

### "extremely dissatisfied with this company"
Worst airline you could fly. I had the worst experience of my entire flying experience and I work for an airline! They have no space for your bags in the cabin forget about a carry on a small backpack barely fits. The customer service is nearly non existent and when you do get help they are rude and unhelpful. Honestly didn’t help with a single issue I had and was extremely rude. I spoke over the phone with someone who was rude and then left me on hold for over 30min as a punishment they would pick up I heard someone in the background and was put on hold again. I think on their end the phone beeps after being on hold to long so she would pick up and just put me n Hold again and never ended up helping me. The customer service at bag check in was rude and didn’t help either. I am extremely dissatisfied with this company will go out of my way to tell people not to take them that’s how trash they are. Save your money and travel literally any other way possible.

### "worst airline I have ever used"
Not Verified |  The worst airline I have ever used. Slow at check in (because everyone pays for something extra), they charge extra for boarding pass at airport €30, luggage to cabin-€60. If you want to save money, use another airline.

### "Their customer service is pretty much non-existent"
I travel a lot and this airline is the worst one I have ever dealt with. If I could go back, I would spend twice as much to go on a different airline. They lost our luggage on literally a 30 minute flight, when we had paid a lot of extra money to check in a suitcase in the first place. Their customer service is pretty much non-existent. It is impossible to reach an actual human and everything on their website gives you errors, including the lost luggage claim form and the luggage tracking reference number. When you call their customer service number, there is an automated message telling you to go to the FAQ on their website then it disconnects. So on top of losing our valuables, we won't even get compensated for their mistake. The most ridiculous scam of a company I have ever dealt with.

### "never had a problem with them"
It is a low cost, but I never had a problem with them. Mostly on time, staff were kind and I got a refund and/or voucher when flights were cancelled. Congratulations

### "Very satisfied overall"
Tenerife Sur to Asturias. Punctual both on the outbound flight and on the return flight. Comfortable seats (good distance between rows). Friendly check-in staff and flight attendants attentive to the needs of passengers. Very satisfied overall. We will repeat the flight with this company.

### "does not abide by its own bag policy"
My husband and I were on our honeymoon returning from Santorini to Athens with the same luggage we carried when we flew into Santorini. When we booked our flights, we paid for extra baggage and weight, just to get to the boarding gate and be told that my carry-on suitcase was too big. (I have a universal standard size carry-on). Although these fees were paid upfront when booking, we had to pay an additional 50 euros to check in a carry-on at the boarding gate. The gate agent was very rude and had no sympathy or tried looking at our reservation to see everything we initially paid for. This company does not abide by its own bag policy and some people were let on the plane with the same size carry-on that I had. It’s very contradicting that I was able to fly into Santorini without being charged for my carryon but returning, hit with a baggage fee. Literally almost everyone boarding the flight ended up paying the extra fees. There has to be some type of commission these gate agents are getting because I’ve never experienced anything like this from all airlines I’ve flown on.

### "the customer service is terrible"
The policies aren’t respected and neither are the customers flying Volotea. My wife and I flew from Santorini the morning of 20 May 2022. We purchased extra weight for our luggages and everything. The carry on luggage policy completely changed from when we first flew out to Santorini. Also the customer service is terrible. The way that staff at the gate speaks to priority customers is distasteful. Furthermore, if you’re reading this, I strongly recommend not flying this airline and to pass the word. Volotea and Delta Airlines service has given me nothing but problems for my first trip out of the country. My rating is not for the flight service, its for the customer service and breach of policy.

### "Will never fly this airline again"
Will never fly this airline again. Turned what was supposed to be a 2hr travel day into a 13hr one. Had landing gear issues so we turned around and to land in Athens instead of Mykonos for what I have to assumed was reasons of technician and resource availability. What I had a problem with was the complete lack of communication from flight staff about why we had turned around and had to attempt multiple landings before getting on the ground. Flight attendants also proceeded to RUN to the exit windows to look outside, causing unnecessary panic to all of us and again didn’t disclose why they did that. After we were safely back in Athens, no information was given to the airport staff and no one was able to tell us when we would be flying again. Ended up getting our bags and going to the island via a ferry but we’re now having trouble getting our refund with little to no phone numbers allowing us to speak to agents. All this after they charged us €30 for not checking in on their app and wanting to do it at the airport. I guess it’s a budget airline for a reason.

### "Good company, good prices"
Valencia to Oviedo. Good company, good prices and everything correct. To travel from Valencia to Asturias the best. If you become megavolotea you have good offers and priority boarding. | Buena compañía, a buenos precios y todo correcto. Para viajar de valencia a Asturias la mejor. Si te haces megavolotea tienes buenas ofertas y el embarque prioritario

### "friendliness of the company"
Highlight the friendliness of the company, the good price ratio, mainly on domestic flights and the customer service that for me is very important to talk to people and not machines. It does not charge hand luggage, it allows you to check it in for free and if you are a priority you can take it in the cabin. I recommend it to my friends.

### "refused to refund our money"
Not Verified |  We booked a flight on Volotea and they canceled and rescheduled it to a date which wouldn’t be possible for us. They then refused to refund our money and only offered a voucher for flying another time which we also can’t use. They give you the run around if you try get your money back.

### "the refund never went through"
Volotea cancelled my reservation twice, and I was no longer able to fly with them. I am extremely unlikely to use a flight credit from them, as I am a US citizen. They initially agreed to process a cash refund, considering their agreement states that 2 cancel/reschedules makes me eligible for a cash refund, however, the refund never went through. When I inquired, they kept sending me the same copy/paste response that my refund has been processed in the form of a flight credit.

### "Very kind, helpful and attentive staff"
Very kind, helpful and attentive staff. The flight lasts only 1h15 between Strasbourg and Nice. Small delays from time to time, but most of the time the flights are on time.

### "very valuable airline"
Asturias to Fuerteventura. Very pleasant flight from Asturias to Fuerteventura. Departure and arrival at scheduled time. I have flew this airline several times during the last year. They have very clean aircrafts and very good inflight service. I recommend Volotea as a very valuable airline at affordable prices.

### "baggage policy is flexible"
Asturias to Málaga. I use this airline frequently. What I like most is the price and the local destinations. Although it’s a lowcost company, its benefits are much better than others of the same condition. Their baggage policy is much more flexible than others. I certainly choose it as the first option.

### "love traveling with Volotea"
Asturias to Seville. I love traveling with Volotea, I fly with them frequently, especially the trip from Asturias to Seville. What I like the most is the quality-price ratio they have. The stewardess are very friendly, and they always help you with your luggage and the flight is always short.

### "Pleasant staff"
Strasbourg to Barcelona. I had a pleasant flight with Volotea. Pleasant staff, on-time flight, clean plane. I find that Volotea offers excellent value for money: I recommend.

### "always a pleasure"
Not Verified | Catania to Verona. Great company. It is always a pleasure to fly whit it. No problem at all. Easy to contact for assistance by social media and very easy to book a flight whit app

### "recommend this airline"
Volotea has rigorously complied with the departure and arrival times. The crew has been very friendly, attentive and helpful. The cleanliness inside the aircraft is remarkable. The soft The baggage policy has allowed me to travel with everything I need for a two-week holiday at no extra cost. I will continue to travel with Volotea and recommend this airline.

### "Really good service"
Not Verified | Seville to Santander. Really good service, from the booking until the pick up of luggage. Probably the best option to fly between small medium size cities in the South of Europe. | Un servicio realmente bueno, desde la reserva hasta la entrega de maletas. Probablemente la mejor opción para volar entre aeropuertos medianos en el sur the europa

### "Stay away from Volotea"
Had a flight from another airline from NY to Madrid and then bought a flight from Volotea's sight from Madrid to Nantes to get to my friends wedding. They then reschedule my flight without reason! There were no more flights to arrive on time to my friends wedding that day so I had to buy a flight for another day. Allianz insurance rejected my claim and lost hundreds of dollars thanks to Volotea's lack of competence. Stay away from Volotea, otherwise you may deal with their unethical practices and have to worry about your flight changing.

### "Highly recommended"
Very good company. I usually travel on the Asturias to Seville route with them and they always offer cheap prices, punctuality and good treatment from the crew. Highly recommended.

### "travel within Spain at cheap rates"
I have flight with Volotea several times and never had a problem, none flying "solo" neither flying with two young children. Routes through European cities and across Spain. Clean and safe planes and nice staff. You can also use their entertainment system. I recommend them to travel within Spain at cheap rates, it is really worth the money spent.

### "The flight was good"
The flight was good. The departure was on time and we arrived early. In spite of pandemic situation, the boarding went smoothly and we could take in the cabin all bags for a short vacation.

### "they never really try to find a solution"
Not Verified | During the summer we bought tickets with Volotea to travel from Thessaloniki to Mykonos - which got cancelled. I asked for refund of the ticket’s amount in August 2021 and to this day have not yet received it. I’ve sent a dozen of emails which are always replied in the same vague way making me wait 4-6 weeks each time they “try” to make the transfer - which according to them fails. There is no follow-up on the case at all and each time I reach out I have to explain the whole situation again, and they never really try to find a solution. I feel like I’m talking with an automated program, awful customer service. Since it’s been almost 6 years I will work with a lawyer and sue the company - which seems to be the only way to get back the money that is rightfully mine. This is pretty much the same with stealing. I will never purchase a ticket in Volotea again. Never.

### "I recommend this airline"
flight with Volotea. The flight was on time, personnel was very nice seats were comfortable. It was also a good price. I recommend this airline.

### "Courteous staff on board"
Arrival 1 hour in advance. Quick and courteous check-in at the Flight counter on time. Courteous welcome on boarding. Priority boarding respected. Courteous staff on board. Clear safety instructions. Barrier gestures respected (gloved and masked staff) Friendly atmosphere on board. Moderately comfortable seat but sufficient for a flight of 1h20. Arrive in advance. Quick disembarkation. Arrivée 1h à l'avance. Enregistrement rapide et courtois au comptoir Vol à l'heure. Accueil courtois à l'embarquement. Embarquement prioritaire respecté. Personnel courtois à bord. Indications de sécurité claires. Gestes barrière respectés (personnel ganté et masqué) Ambiance bienveillante à bord. Siège moyennement confortables mais suffisant pour un vol de 1h20. Arrivée à l'avance. Débarquement rapide.

### "satisfied with the quality of welcome on board"
I travel 2 to 3 times a month with Volotea on the Bordeaux-Strasbourg and Strasbourg-Bordeaux line. I am very satisfied with the quality of the welcome on board, the friendliness of the staff (the good distance between sympathy and professional relations). For 1 year that I practice this line, the flights are rather punctual, the information on board of the captain is useful. I appreciate that the exits of the plane are well organized by row numbers, especially in the current times of pandemic. As a Megavolotea+, I get benefits from treatments that are right for me. One more certain would be: a specific baggage drop-off line for MégavoloteaPlus, to ensure that there is always something to store as a snack for us your members. Je voyage 2 à 3 fois par mois avec Volotea sur la ligne Bordeaux-Strasbourg et Strasbourg-Bordeaux. Je suis très satisfaite de la qualité de l'accueil à bord, l'amabilité du personnel (la bonne distance entre la sympathie et le professionnalisme des relations). Depuis 1 an que je pratique cette ligne, le vols sont plutôt ponctuels, les informations à bord du commandant sont utiles. J'apprécie que les sorties de l'avion soient bien organisées par numéros de rangée, surtout par les temps actuels de pandémie. En tant que Megavolotea+, je bénéfice d'avantages de traitements qui me conviennent. Un plus certain serait : une ligne de dépose bagage spécifique pour les MégavoloteaPlus, s'assurer que il y a toujours de quoi porposer en snack pour nous vos adhérents.

### "I wish Volotea a lot of success"
Frequent flyer on the Toulouse-Strasbourg route since 2016 so almost since the launch of it by Volotea for both professional and leisure purposes. I travel on this line once a month (round trip). I remember very few problems of delay. I appreciate the frequency of the flights,  and a return to Toulouse at the end of the day. The MegaVolotea Plus program I find affordable as including priority access and the dedicated call line that I had to use following a few anomalies encountered on the reservation site. In my opinion, the company well managed the containment period due to Covid-19 in the spring of 2020. The A319s in use today are more comfortable than the B-717s used at the beginning, the staff on board is young, friendly and attentive. I wish Volotea a lot of success for the future.

### "lack of "grip" from the crew"
Overall good flight but 2 negative points - non respect of the rules for exiting the plane by the passengers and lack of grip from the crew members to enforce these rules. - on the return flight, waiting for more than 30 munisses in the plane without any information, to see the arrival of 2 passengers who were in transit. It would not cost the captain anything to make an announcement to warn of the causes of the delay. Bon vol dans l'ensemble 2 points négatifs - non respect des règles de sortie de l'avion par les passagers et manque de "poigne" des membres de l'équipage pour faire respecter ces règles. - au vol retour, attente de plus de 30 munisses dans l'avion sans aucune information, pour voir arriver 2 passagers qui étaient en transit. Cela n'aurait rien couter au commandant de bord de faire une annonce pour prévenir des causes du retard.

### "Good price / quality ratio"
Good price / quality ratio thanks to special fares granted to Sardinia residents. No-frill service. Cabin staff could me more hospitable and smile at passengers as everybody else in the industry. Aircraft clean.

### "good value for money"
I went to Corfu from Bordeaux for my birthday. The staff on board is classy and pleasant. The service also even if we have to pay for our glasses, the red wine is of good quality and the trip is always good value for money (although a small gourmet cheese sandwich for the aperitif would be super welcome). I recommend Volotea because it is punctual, pleasant service, comfortable seating, I went to Corfu from Bordeaux for my birthday. The staff on board is pleasant. The service also even if we have to pay for our glasses, the red wine is of good quality and the trip is always good value for money (although a small gourmet cheese sandwich for the aperitif would be super welcome). I recommend the Volotea company because it is punctual, pleasant service, comfortable seating, good value for money. Je suis partie à Corfu de Bordeaux pour mon anniversaire. Le personnel à bord est agréable. Le service également même si on doit payer pour nos verres, le vin rouge est de bonne qualité et le trajet reste un bon rapport qualité / prix (même si un petit sandwich gourmet au fromage pour l’apéro serait super bienvenue). Je recommande Volotea car ponctuelle, service agréable, confort siège, bon rapport qualité /prix.

### "crew were pleasant and attentive"
The trip with Volotea went well, no particular problems, no delay. The crew were pleasant and attentive to the travelers The prices are attractive when done in advance. Fair at the check-in counters, a lot of waiting and at the level of the boarding control. Le voyage avec VOLOTEA s'est bien passé, aucun soucis particuliers, pas de problèmes, pas de retard L'équipage agréable et aux petits soins pour les voyageurs. Les prix sont attractifs lorsque l'on s'y prends à l'avance Juste au niveau des comptoirs d'enregistrement beaucoup d'attente et au niveau du contrôle à l'embarquement, c'est toujours dans la précipitation.

### "very attractive prices"
Not Verified | Ajaccio to Lille. The flight went well on time. Tickets at very attractive prices a problem when booking my boarding pass that was resolved by customer service | Le vol s'est bien passé à l'heure. Billets à prix très attractifs un problème au moment de la réservation de ma carte d'embarquement qui a été résolu par le service client

### "special offers for its customers"
I have been flying with Volotea for many years to return to my hometown. Volotea is flexible in changes, has special offers for its customers. Even during the pandemic, it ensured flights and refunds in the event of cancellation. Comfortable planes and luggage included up to some limits.

### "we were refunded the amounts paid"
We are very satisfied with the services offered by Volotéa. We think the price / quality ratio is very good. We had to cancel a trip in April 2020 due to the pandemic and after a few exchanges of emails, we were refunded the amounts paid.

### "I still have not received a refund"
Not Verified |  This airline does not have a functioning customer service. I still have not received a refund for a cancelled flight in April 2020. They confirmed in writing in the summer of 2020 that they will transfer the refund within 10 days but they didn't. I have been chasing this without any success since. It surprises me that this airline can hold a valid licence. Obviously the regulator is unaware of their low tactics and non-existent customer service.

### "flights were without problems"
Having made several flights with Volotea, all of these flights were without problems. service on board, quality of the aircraft (cleanliness) beyond reproach. punctuality and if late, explanations given with estimated delay. Ayant effectué plusieurs vols avec Volotea, l'ensemble de ces vols ont été sans problèmes. service à bord, qualité de l'avion (propreté) sans reproche. ponctualité et si retard, explications données avec estimation du retard.

### "Correct and professional care"
Seville to Asturias. Everything's fine. Punctuality in boarding and compliance with schedules. Correct and professional care. My experience in this company is positive.

### "customer service is appalling"
Not Verified |  After 1 year of constant follow up and continued confirmation from Volotea that my refund "is being transferred and as its international will take another 4 weeks". Dozens of chases and sheer frustration I am still, over 1 year later, waiting for a refund. This airlines customer service is appalling and their continued lies of a refund having been made, or continued requests for the same information as delay tactics is disgisting and they should not be allowed to hold an IATA licence. How they are allowed to get away with taking customers money and not refunding and providing false responses is a disgrace.

### "not hesitate to recommend Volotea"
I am a resident of Oviedo and the truth is that here in Asturias the airlines had us a little abandoned and with abusive prices, until Volotea entered with 12 destinations. The truth is that after several trips, I can only say that it is a great company and very serious, since whenever I have a problem flying, they solve it quickly. Comment that I became a megavolotea and the prices are very good, being able to make 3 or 4 trips a year with my family. I do not hesitate to recommend Volotea and I will continue using it because for me it is a total success. Soy residente en Oviedo y la verdad que aquí en Asturias las aerolíneas nos tenían un poco abandonados y con precios abusivos, hasta que entró Volotea con 12 destinos. La verdad que después de varios viajes, sólo puedo decir que es una gran compañía y muy seria, ya que siempre que tengo un problema para volar te lo resuelven rápidamente. Comentar que me hice megavolotea y los precios son muy buenos, pudiendo hacer 3 o 4 viajes al año con mi familia. Yo no dudo en recomendar volotea y seguiré usándola porque para mi es un acierto total

### "With Volotea's planes I have enough space"
Volotea is a company that has routes that are perfect for my trips. And they do it at very competitive prices. There are two things I want to highlight: 1) The MegaVolotea programme has great advantages for its members and allows great savings throughout the year. 2) The distance between seats. In other companies my knees collide with the front seat. With Volotea's planes I have enough space. I am also grateful for the friendliness of their staff, the punctuality of their flights and the small details that make the journey more enjoyable.

### "the staff are competent"
The experience with Volotea is positive, the staff are competent, attentive and friendly. The planes are quite comfortable and new, the punctuality and the luggage policy is what makes the experience with this company always pleasant. Whenever I can I choose Volotea, for well-being, for comfort and for price, in the end it is always a good experience. If you are super Volotea there are advantages that make worth the annual subscription payment. La experiencia con Volotea es positiva, el personal es competente, atento y amables. Los aviones son bastante cómodos y nuevos, la puntualidad y la política de maletas es lo que hace que la experiencia con esta compañía sea placentera. Siempre que puedo elijo Volotea, por bienestar, por comodidad y por precio, al final es una buena experiencia. Si eres súper Volotea hay ventajas que hacen que valga la pena el pago de la suscripción anual.

### "book with any other competitor"
Of all the bad experiences I've had with an airline, Volotea is by far the worst. I'm almost impressed at how dreadful they made the experience. 1) Baggage change - I couldn't change my baggage allowance online, and when I got in touch with their customer service via email, they told me several times to use the website. I sent them screenshots of how that wasn't possible, so they finally recommended that I call. During the call, they still couldn't upgrade my baggage allowance and then notified me about my cancelled return flight. 2) Cancellation without notice - they cancelled my flight from Santorini back to Athens without telling me. They said they sent an email, and I searched for all the emails they sent to my Gmail and screenshot it, and it clearly didn't have an email on the day when they said I would've received it nor the subject line. It also wasn't in my spam folder. I asked them to then tell me what other options I had that week, and they said they had no other flights from Santorini back to Athens. Really? Then I had to ask them to refund me for that portion, and confirm that it wouldn't affect my departing flight. They said they would do so, and yes, it wouldn't affect my departing flight. 3) Athens kiosk not open - there was a very long line at the kiosk, and the workers very rudely told all of us that they wouldn't even talk to us until 1.5 hours before departure. That would have been potentially fine if they were nicer about it, but then ... 4) Departing flight reservation missing - of course, after all the incompetence and rudeness, I found that my departing flight was indeed affected by my request for a refund. They told me that I had cancelled my entire reservation. No, I protested, not only did I have a log of the name of the representative and time of the call, but I had an email with the revised itinerary for just the departing flight. They disagreed, even with the email and boarding pass, they said they couldn't find my name in the system and I'd need to rebook. Fine, as despicable as they were and abhorrent as it would be to give them more money, I had to be at a wedding in Santorini. After many calls with the airport's concierge and waiting fretfully as the final call at the gate approached, the concierge finally told me they confirmed I had another booking to take to the kiosk. Upon getting back to the incredibly rude Volotea kiosk attendants, they noted they finally found my original reservation. Unbelievable! 5) Luggage check - after all the hassle with the luggage constraints, upon boarding, they didn't even weigh my luggage. It was all for nothing, and in many ways, the experience was even worse when I tried to play by their rules. 6) Return flight refund - I still haven't received my return flight refund and it's been over 5 weeks. They said it would take 10 business days. I've never had the displeasure of an experience from product, online customer service, phone support, in person interaction, booking, luggage requirements, scheduling, and overall communication in my life. Everyone at Volotea should be ashamed of themselves and think very hard about what they're putting out into the world - causing stress, upsetting customers, potentially causing much worse experiences. I urge anyone considering booking with Volotea to book with any other competitor.

### "Avoid at all costs!"
Avoid at all costs! My flight was on April 2020 and it was canceled due to COVID. So what they did to take my money is, give me online credit that expired in April 2021 I'm not able to use it. And when I plan to use it, I find it expired! Why would my money be expired on me!

### "I never got my money back!"
They moved / cancelled my flights 3 times until I decided to request a refund. And I never got my money back! Try talking to them, it is impossible over phone or chat. Buyer beware! once they take your money, you're at their mercy and they just don't care.

### "We had a nice flight"
Not Verified |  Very comfortable seats, airplane was very clean and the hostesses were welcoming. The fare was very reasonable (we booked the same day we travelled) and the flight left on schedule and arrived on time. We had a nice flight which compensated us for the bad Venice airport experience.

### "pay another 120 euros at check-in"
I do not like Volotea. My friend and I bought air tickets from Athens to Heraklion there and back for 200 euros and had to pay another 120 euros at check-in! They're crazy! It is better to fly with proven airlines.

### "I didn't expect them to be so fair after reviews I had read before"
I bought a ticket Athens-Mykonos, paid at night time (this probably influenced the timing of getting the e-mail with confirmation of the booking. I waited for it 6 hours ), thought it’s not going to come because the departure was the next day, I decided not to take the risk and bought a completely new ticket with another airline, meanwhile in the morning came the long-awaited letter from Volotea. I contacted the Volotea support, after a hard conversation, the company returned the money for the spent ticket to my account, in 2 days. Thank you Volotea. Honestly I didn't expect them to be so fair after reviews I had read before.

### "the crew calm, professional and courteous"
Although we experienced a delay of about 40 minutes (pilot explained it was due to the sheer number of flights around Marseille on their way back to Ajaccio), the boarding was fairly smooth, the crew calm, professional and courteous. Volotea offers a very simple menu to purchase from. As priority passengers, we had a choice of a mere free chocolate bar that we had to request. No drinks. I would like to acknowledge Volotea is one of the rare airlines to have sent an email to apologise for the delay. That is appreciated and for that reason I will recommend them for short journeys. Ps: Note we traveled 1st week of August, one of the busiest week of the year for tourism in Corsica and therefore we paid a premium price that is probably not justified.

### "the worst company ever"
I unfortunately flew twice with this company, they are the only one providing a direct connection Prague/Cagliari. I used their services 3 times and 2 it was on the top worse experience I have ever had in my life with an airline. The first time their website didn't work,  I couldn't do the check in online and at the airport they asked me for money to do the check in in there (even though I couldn't do it myself online due to problem with their website). I claimed the money and they didn't even reply, ever. The second was 2 days ago. I was supposed to fly at 21:44pm. They sent me twice (at 19 and then at 21) a message saying that my flight was delayed. When I arrived to the airport for the check in I found out the flight was overbooked and there was no room for me. It's already disappointing that you made me buy the tickets even thought there were no seats available, however I know it can happen, but really why you kept sending me messages saying the flight was delayed if you already knew I wasn't going to board! Why did you make me go to the airport in the first place? During the late evening! It's the worst company ever! Avoid at any cost!

### "not book a flight with Volotea ever again"
Not Verified |  The flight time changed and we had to fly 6 hours later than the flight time we had booked for. We contacted the customer service and they didn't even give us a voucher for food and drinks. The staff on the phone was very rude. The aircraft was small and noisy and dirty, which is unacceptable especially during a pandemic. I would not book a flight with Volotea ever again.

### "flight was well organized from start to finish"
The flight was well organized from start to finish. Boarding started at the scheduled time and just 20 minutes later we were all in the cabin. The flight was complete. The seats are wide and clean. The staff are always attentive. The plane was quiet and both take-off and landing we hardly knew. We arrive 15 minutes before the indicated time. Volotea prices are very cheap specially if if you buy them in advance. It is a company without luxuries but within excellent value for money.

### "advice against flying with the"
Worst airline experience I ever have. They will change your ticket dates and times multiple times (like they did to us 3 times) without asking or any notification. Due to that fact we have bought multiple boat tickets and payed extra costs on airbnb. Also their customer service is very bad. Honestly, this company is one level above scammers. They don't treat their customers with respect and I advice against flying with them

### "Do not trust this company"
Do not trust this company. We are waiting in the airport for hours no information on where the plane is, if it will ever arrive or what is happening. No customer service, no informed employee don't waste your money

### "Absolute worst customer service"
Absolute worst customer service and airline. I booked a flight for my anniversary. The flight got changed/cancelled for the return and received no notice. I only found out when I tried to get boarding passes the day of the flight. After multiple tries of contacting the airline, I finally got a hold of someone who hung up mid call. The second person I finally talked to said I would get a refund, but I have received no notification of a refund or anything. I’ve tried to use the chat but they told me they couldn’t help and to send an email. When I try to email, it says my email is invalid. Nothing works. The worst customer service I’ve dealt with and still no refund. I will never use this airline again. I hope this doesn’t happen to others, but sadly, I’m sure it will.

### "the most unreliable company"
Volotea is the most unreliable company I have ever used. Last year the cancelled our outbound flight so we have to go from Athens to Corfu by bus as we wasn't time flexible. I kept the credit so I could use it this summer. We planed a trip with a friend and guess what, they cancelled again. They manage to ruin my vacations for two summers in a row.

### "staff are very professional and friendly"
Compagnie sérieuse, les horaires sont respectées avec même souvent de l'avance sur le timing, embarquement, débarquement rapide, avions confortables, lignes proposées comme le Montpellier Nantes est très appréciable. Les tarifs sont très corrects. Le personnel au sol comme en vol est très professionnel et sympathique. - A serious company, the schedules are respected, often even with the advance on the timing, boarding, fast disembarking, comfortable planes, lines proposed like the Montpellier Nantes are very appreciable. The prices are very correct. The staff on the ground and in the air are very professional and friendly.

### "Excellent value for money"
Good flight in perfect time, excellent staff on board and before boarding. Excellent value for money, I am a Megavolotea plus member and I took advantage of further discounts and with priority free offer so I brought my trolley on board directly without boarding it. I have been flying with Volotea for a long time and have always enjoyed it. in the last year due to Covid, several flights were first modified and then canceled, but Volotea always gave me a 120% voucher or refunded the flight. A clean plane with orderly and precise boarding and disembarking.

### "Excellent policy anti-COVID"
Excellent policy anti-COVID, flight in time, good experience. The flight program Supervolotea permits to have good prices and priority boarding in every flight. Till September every flight will be covered by flex insurence.

### Volotea customer review
Vol à l'heure, Avion propre. Le Personnel de bord est professionnel. Respect des consignes COVID. Respect de l'embarquement pour les personnes prioritaires. - Flight on time, Clean plane. The cabin crew are professional. Compliance with COVID guidelines. Respect of boarding for priority people.

### "always had all of my refunds"
I am satisfied with Volotea despite several flights canceled by the health crisis. I have always had all of my refunds. I hope this company will continue to operate normally now. Attractive price of flights Je suis satisfait de la compagnie VOLOTEA malgré plusieurs vols annulé par la crise sanitaire. J'ai toujours eu tout mes remboursement. J'espère que cette compagnie vas continué a fonctionner maintenant normalement. Prix attractif des vols.

### "staff remains at your disposal"
Company at the top even in these difficult times the staff remains at your disposal. The reservation is simple and fast, the value for money in comparison with the train and / or other companies is really interesting. Negative point : some flight schedule change 2 weeks before we have to cancel the flight or book an hotel or to change the flight (but as the new date is close to the travel, the price is to high) and it's too late to book with an other companion (price to high too).

### "most pleasant of the low cost airlines"
I use Volotea quite regularly as I work and live in different cities. Their prices are great and outside of Covid, they have a pretty good schedule, though the cities they fly to is rather restricted. Their prices are unbeatable. Their website is easy to schedule tickets on and to check on reservations and somewhat uniquely, if you are a premium member (Megavolta), you can download pick seats and download your ticket at the time of purchase - this is so useful. The ground staff are rare and hard to find sometimes, and changes (eg delays) are very late coming to the airport screens. Also, If using an electronic ticket and their site is down they make you buy one at the airport for 30 Euros. They do send email and text notices when things change - and they do more often than with other airlines (20% of the time?) They are efficient with boarding and less demeaning than some other low cost airlines (EasyJet). The onboard crew are always professional but not cold. Often help passengers with luggage, etc. The seats are fine, rather normal and not the crammed together ones seen on other low cost airlines. The pilots are also relaxed and communicative. Two, three years ago, their cancellation and delay record was abysismal. This has radically improved (at least before Covid). Now they rarely cancel at the last minute and mostly fly on time. Anyway, for me they are a great value and the most pleasant of the low cost airlines I have flown.

### "completely reasonable prices"
The Volotea staff are very friendly, charming and smiling. Respect of deadlines and completely reasonable prices. Everything is OK. I can't wait for flights to resume to travel with Volotea again. Le personnel Volotea est très sympatique, charmant et souriant. Respect des délais et prix tout à fait raisonnables. Tout est OK. J'ai hâte que les vols reprennent pour voyager à nouveau avec Volotea.

### "Good organisation despite the situation"
No particular problem. Flight on time. Nice crew. Good organisation despite the situation. Please keep this way of disembarking the passengers rank after rank. It's so easier, quieter, and eventually faster than usually when everybody try to rush out at the same time.

### "I highly recommend it"
Napoli to Palermo  in 2020. I travel frequently with my son for family reunification reasons. Our experience with the Volotea company has always been excellent, as has always been the welcome on the aircraft and the assistance provided to me by customer service when we needed it (for change bookings, request for reimbursement due to ficuciary quarantine, or just to get additional information). Always punctual in departure and sometimes even in advance of arrival, the staff all positively distinguish themselves for professionalism and kindness. I hope that we can return to travel soon and I highly recommend it to everyone. Viaggio di frequente insieme a mio figlio per motivi di ricongiungimento familiare. La nostra esperienza con la compagnia Volotea è sempre stata ottima, come ottima è sempre stata l'accoglienza sull'aeromobile e l'assistenza fornitami dal servizio clienti quando ne abbiamo avuto bisogno (per cambio prenotazioni, richiesta rimborso a causa di quarantena ficuciaria, o solo per attingere informazioni aggiuntive). Sempre puntuali nella partenza e a volte anche in anticipo sull'arrivo, il personale tutto si distingue positivamente per professionalità e gentilezza. Spero che si possa presto ritornate a viaggiare e la consiglio vivamente a tutti.

### Volotea customer review
Strasbourg to Bordeaux in December 2020. Everything went extremely smooth. As a Megavolotea Plus member, I have been able to enjoy priority boarding and my cabin luggage traveling with me in the cabin despite the restrictions due to the current pandemic. Ground staff was efficient, and cabin crew were smiling and available to passengers on request, especially as they had to manage people wearing their mask properly and walking in the alleys to use the toilets. I'm used to travel with Volotea for inner flights in France, but also a few ones between France and other UE countries, and I must say it's always been what I'm expecting from them : to fly me from point A to point B in a relative comfort and on time. Looking forward to enjoy flying with Volotea again, once all this crazy situation is behind us.

### "The flight went very well"
I really appreciate the Volotea company. The flight went very well. The schedules were respected even in advance. The sanitary conditions are well respected, I traveled with confidence with the Volotea company. The crew members are very pleasant, even at our service to help us put our suitcase in the compartment. The prices of this company are very affordable and their flight offers are interesting. I look forward to being able to fly again with the Volotea Company to which I have been loyal for many years. J’apprécie énormément la compagnie Volotea. Le vol s’est très bien passé. Les horaires ont été respectés même avec de l’avance. Les conditions sanitaires sont bien respectées, j’ai voyagé en toute confiance avec la compagnie Volotea. Les membres d’équipage sont très agréables, à notre service même pour nous aider à mettre notre valise dans le compartiment. Les tarifs de cette compagnie sont très abordables et leur proposition de vols sont intéressantes. J’ai hâte de pouvoir re voler avec la Compagnie Volotea à laquelle je suis fidèle depuis de nombreuses années.

### "the staff is friendly"
With Volotea you travel very well, the staff is friendly and the ground service is punctual. I often travel for work and if the airport and / or the city where I go is from Volotea I choose them. They have been "megavolotea" for a long time and their offers are unique. Con Volotea si viaggia benissimo,il personale è cordiale ed il servizio a terra puntuale. Viaggio spesso per lavoro e se l'aeroporto e/o la città dove vado è ciperta da Volotea scelgo loro. Sono "megavolotea" da tanto tempo e le loro offorte sono uniche.

### "personnel very professional"
Reservations simple. Good trip, on time, pleasant and fast boarding. Good seats, personnel very professional. Quick and easy-to-use boarding pass. Competitive and affordable price for a family.

### "It was a very pleasant trip"
Fue un viaje muy agradable, sin ningún incidente. No tuvimos ningún retraso y las medidas de seguridad fueron satisfactorias. El embarque fue muy rápido y la política de equipaje está bien. - It was a very pleasant trip, without any incident. We had no delays and the security measures were satisfactory. Boarding was fast and the baggage policy is good.

### "a standard low cost company"
Volotea is a company that, having as its base the Asturias airport, allows me to return home from multiple points in the Mediterranean (Alicante, Valencia, Murcia ...) at quite competitive prices if we compare them with the alternatives of traveling by train or car. It is a standard low cost company, but they are quite compliant with the schedules, so for trips of an hour, an hour and a half, it is enough. Regarding your cabin staff, I have a contradictory opinion, since there are people who are friendly and others who are not. As for the coronavirus, I think it would be useful if I kept the routes even with travel restrictions, even if it involves a price increase by not filling the planes, in my case I would be willing to pay the price of the renfe ticket (120-150 euros round trip) to avoid those eight to ten hours of travel. Volotea es una compañía que al tener como base el aeropuerto de Asturias me permite volver a casa desde múltiples puntos del Mediterráneo (Alicante, Valencia, Murcia...) a precios bastante competitivos si los comparamos con las alternativas de viajar en tren o en coche. Es una compañía lowcost estándar, pero son bastante cumplidores con los horarios, por lo que para trayectos de hora, hora y media, es suficiente. Respecto a su personal de cabina, tengo una opinión contradictoria, puesto que hay personas amables y otras que no lo son tanto. En cuanto al coronavirus, creo que sería útil que mantuviera las rutas incluso con las restricciones de viaje, aunque suponga un aumento de precio al no llenar los aviones, en mi caso estaría dispuesto a pagar el precio del billete de renfe (120-150 euros ida y vuelta) por evitar esas ocho-diez horas de viaje.

### "economical airline with good service"
I frequently use this airline for personal reasons, it has a stable route that connects the north and south of Spain. Highlight the good value for money, it is an economical airline with good service. They have a chat service that works well in case there is a problem. I recommend subscribing as a megavolotea if you are going to be a frequent traveler since the discounts compensate from the first moment. Uso frecuentemente esta aerolinea por motivos personales, tiene una ruta estable que conecta el norte y el sur de España. Destacar la buena relación calidad precio, es una aerolinea económica y con buen servicio. Tienen un servicio de chat que funciona bien por si hay algún problema. Recomiendo suscribirse como megavolotea si vas a ser viajero frecuente ya que los descuentos compensan desde el primer momento.

### "staff are pleasant and professional"
Je prend souvent l'avion pour faire le trajet Montpellier - nantes. Volotea propose toutes l'année ce trajet, sans escale et à des horaires adéquats (en début de soirée, ce qui permet de prendre l'avion à la sortie du travail), à des tarifs intéressants (si on s'y prend en avance). Le personnel est agréable et professionnel. - I often take the plane to travel from Montpellier to Nantes. Volotea offers this route all year round, non-stop and at suitable times (in the early evening, which allows you to take the plane after work), at attractive prices (if you plan in advance ). The staff are pleasant and professional.

### "The treatment of the staff is very friendly"
Estoy muy contenta con esta compañía porque nunca he tenido problemas. Espero continuar viajando con Volotea durante muchos años. Suelen despegar en la hora prevista y no suele haber retrasos en las llegadas. El trato del personal es muy amable. - I am very happy with this company because I have never had any problems. I hope to continue traveling with Volotea for many years to come. They usually take off at the scheduled time and there are usually no delays in arrivals. The treatment of the staff is very friendly.

### "looking forward flying with Volotea again"
Flight experience with Volotea is fine. Good prices, very good service and covering non standard routes. Absolutely recommendable and looking forward flying with Volotea again.

### "I am always very satisfied with my flights with Volotea"
I am always very satisfied with my flights with Volotea. The seats are comfortable, the staff pleasant, I have hardly had any delays with my flights. I am a Mégavolotea member and the reductions are generally interesting, the gift vouchers for my birthday are always cool. I only had a problem once (reimbursement which took many months to arrive), but this is probably explained by the Covid crisis which started right at that time. I highly recommend this airline!

### "I am 100% satisfied"
I am frequently travelling with Volotea as they proposed some direct flights from Toulouse (where I am currently living) to Corsica (where my family lives). I am 100% satisfied as steward is always nice, helpful (I am often travelling with children) and sometimes even funny! Apart from the fact that sometimes flight schedules are quite early, every single trip is a very nice moment.

### "Very attractive price"
Very attractive price, especially as a Mégavolotea member. The website is well designed and it is easy to make a reservation. For boarding, the staff is smiling and caring. FR: Prix très attractif, d'autant plus en étant membre Mégavolotea Le site internet est bien réalisé et il est simple d'effectuer une réservation. Pour l'embarquement, le personnel est  souriant.

### "Volotea always offers the best prices"
Volotea always offers the best prices. I had to fly during the covid pandemic, and they had perfectly adapted to the situation. The flight is never late. Moreover we often land with 20 mn before the due hour of arrival, which is great.

### "good value for money"
Je voyage souvent avec Volotea et c'était un réel plaisir. L'équipage est très professionnel, poli et agréable. La cabine est très récente et propre. Les sièges sont confortables. Le vol était à l'heure. Heureusement que Volotea propose des vols directs sur cet itinéraire, avec un très bon rapport qualité-prix. I travel very often with Volotea and once again it was a real pleasure. The crew are professional, polite and pleasant. The cabin is new and clean. The seats are comfortable. The flight was on time. Fortunately, Volotea offers direct flights on this route, with very good value for money.

### "staff are very pleasant and helpful"
Volotea est une très bonne compagnie aérienne. Le personnel est très agréable et serviable. Les avions sont toujours très propres et la compagnie respectent à la lettre les contraintes sanitaires. - Volotea is a very good airline. The staff are very pleasant and helpful. The planes are clean and the company respects health constraints.

### "good value for money"
I book Volotea for my domestic flights because I find it good value for money when you do it in advance. The planes are clean and the staff friendly. Je réserve Volotea pour mes vols nationaux car je trouve qu’il y a un bon rapport qualité prix quand on s’y prend en avance. Les avions sont propres et le personnel bienveillant.

### "I am completely satisfied with Volotea"
Ça fait plusieurs fois que je voyage avec Volotea et je compte encore voyager avec cette compagnie. Tout se déroule bien, les vols sont très compétitifs. Je suis entièrement satisfait de Volotea. - I have traveled with Volotea several times and I still intend to travel with this company. Everything is going well, the flights are very competitive. I am completely satisfied with Volotea.

### "you can travel cheaply"
I upgraded my priority options, so I can benefit of priority boarding, as well as special discounts, offers and gifts. The aircrafts are very confortable, the cabin crew is very polite and professional. The website is very user friendly, so you can select many other services, ie renting a car or a special meal or entertainment on flight. I  recommend to choose Volotea, because you can travel cheaply but without disadvantages.

### "good frequency of the flights"
I started flying with Volotea by establishing an OVD-SVQ route, which was very convenient for me for work. I travel assiduously (although now due to the confinements due to the global situation with the CoVid-19 it is not possible for me) and I enjoy the Megavolotea loyalty program, with advantages such as discounts on the price of travel or certain advantages on the flight such as priority boarding, and some annual travel bonus. Apart from these advantages of the loyalty program, which have hooked me a lot, what stands out above all is the punctuality of its flights and the good frequency of the flights of interest to me. Added to this, their magnificent staff, both on the ground at the airport and the cabin crew make the experience of traveling with them magnificent. Comencé a volar con Volotea al establecer una ruta OVD-SVQ, que me era muy conveniente por trabajo. Viajo asiduamente (aunque ahora debido a los confinamientos devidos a la situación global con la CoVid-19 no me es posible) y disfruto del programa de fidelidad Megavolotea, con ventajas como descuentos en el precio de los viajes o ciertas ventajas en el vuelo como el priority boarding, y alguna bonificación anual en viajes. Aparte de estas ventajas del programa de fidelidad, que me han enganchado bastante, lo que destaco sobre todo es la puntualidad de sus vuelos y la buena frecuencia de los vuelos de mi interés. Sumado a esto, su magnífico personal, tanto en tierra en el aeropuerto como el personal de cabina hacen que la experiencia de viajar con ellos sea magnífica.

### "they have made an effort to improve"
Volotea es una conpañía relativamente nueva, ahora es más conocida, pero la primera vez que viajé con ellos fue hace 8 años. En el 2013 los aviones eran muy viejos, pero actualmente los aviones son muy nuevos, tienen una buena imagen y dan mucha confianza. Se ve que se han esforzado en mejorarlos. Utilizo bastante la aerolinea Volotea, porque hago mucho el vuelo Bilbao-Málaga-Bilbao y ésta ofrece muchas y económicas opciones para este trayecto. También ofrece muchas ofertas (vuelos a 1€, 9€, 15€ o 20€), ya que spu Volotea y además te da un vale de 35€ por tu cumpleaños. Llevo unos cuantos años utilizando lacompañía y ya 3 siendo Megavolotea y no puedo estar más contenta. Si hay alguna modificación o cancelación en los vuelos por parte de ellos te avisan con mucho tiempo y te dan varias posibilidades, ya sea cambio de vuelo sin carho adicional, voucher o reembolso y si se elige la última lo hacen muy rápido. A la hora de la atención recibida en el checkin y en los vuelos es muy buena y rápida. - Volotea is a relatively new company, it is now better known, but the first time I traveled with them was 8 years ago. In 2013 the planes were very old, but today the planes are very new, they have a good image and give a lot of confidence. It is seen that they have made an effort to improve them. I use the Volotea airline a lot, because I do the Bilbao-Malaga-Bilbao flight a lot and it offers many inexpensive options for this route. It also offers many offers (flights at €1, €9, €15 or €20), since Volotea also gives you a €35 voucher for your birthday. I have been using the company for a few years and already 3 being Megavolotea and I could not be happier. If there is any modification or cancellation in the flights by them, they notify you in advance and give you several possibilities, either a flight change without additional cost, voucher or refund and if the last one is chosen they do it very quickly. At the time of the attention received at check-in and on flights is very good and fast.

### "Volotea is an excellent company"
Not Verified |  Para mi volotea es una compañía excelente con la que viajo siempre. Barata, puntual, agradable, fácil de seguir. Llevo varios años siendo megavolotea y no me arrepiento. - For me, Volotea is an excellent company that I always travel with. Cheap, punctual, pleasant, easy to follow. I have been a megavolotea for several years and I do not regret it.

### "great customer service experience on board"
Not Verified |  Flight on time and great customer service experience on board. Verona - Catania, December 2020. Boarding and disembarking were quick. Covid-safe measures very good. Second time flying with Volotea and I would definitely recommend!

### "Crew was professional"
Very early morning flight - 6am. Used the app to book the ticket and check in, so I went straight to the gate. Flight was very cheap - cheaper than the slow ferry. On time. 70% full. Very short flight. Crew was professional. All was ok.

### "maintain that they’ve refunded me"
My flight was changed by 11 hours, so I had the right to a refund. I was back and forth with them for months, they wanted me to take the credit of course. I chose the refund. I saw something saying 90% of people would have their refunds by the end of July, guess I wasn’t one of them because by October I still hadn’t heard anything. Finally they emailed me and said they had found a “wrong” with my bank account and the payment had been rejected. That’s funny, there didn’t seem to be a “wrong” when you took the money in the first place. I’ve emailed them several times since and they maintain that they’ve refunded me already despite the fact I’ve sent them screenshots of my bank account.

### "Flight was delayed by almost 2 hours"
1) Flight was delayed by almost 2 hours. 2) Priority ticket only means you get to board first, no other additional benefits. 3) No fragile sticker available for check in bags. 4) Despite my carry on bag being the appropriate size, a flight attendant hassled me to check in my carry on bag after security to try to squeeze you for every euro.

### "a poor customer service"
Not Verified | I bought a ticket to go to Ibiza by myself. I asked on Instagram how to get one more seat for my daughter and they explained that I would have to buy two new ones and they would refund me the old one I bought. When I tried to verify this via email they told me I could not get any money back as there was no cancellation from the airline (glad I asked first). After they told me they could add an extra seat for me, when I confirm I needed it another person is telling me they can’t do that I would need to get two new tickets. They then offered me to get a voucher, I asked for the voucher and somebody else told me I can’t get a voucher as there has not been any cancellation. The day of the flight arrived and I could not take the flight not get my money back due to not having the last email responded anymore. Very bad service with a poor customer service and no able to do their job accordingly

### "charged me 30 Euros to check in"
I didnt think twice about the airline for a 50 minutes flight, not bothered about a short trip like this but at check in charged me 30 Euros to check in, as stated on the airline's website.

### "they still didn't refund me"
I bought a flight 2 flights with Volotea one from Nantes To Palma for 88 euros and the other from Palma to Bordeaux. A little before the second flight they cancel it, so i had to buy an another one close to my trip and pay the double of the price, and they still didn't refund me. The first one they changed the timetables of the flights after weeks that I bought and planned my whole trip. The flight that was supposed to be on Friday in the evening, so that I can work during the day and get to the airport, was transferred for the morning. Not only do I now need to miss work but all my logistics have changed now that I need to book a hotel to get to the morning flight on time. Also, they put this flight on their site for a price of 43 euros, almost half what I paid. I called the company to get at least the difference of prices or if they can get me a compensation for my charges that their sudden change provoke, and they told me they can't do it anything. Even tho I was polite and calm trying to explain my situation, the server was rude, impatient and not helpful at all. Never again. I end up spending way more because they can't keep a flight at the day and time that we customers bought. Ps: I just received my THIRD alteration!

### "will never book with them again"
The flight was cancelled already in March. Since then I am trying to get a refund, but instead I get “thank you for your patience” whenever I contact them about it. Zero in customer service, will never book with them again.

### "30 euros to print my ticket"
I got very disappointed with Volotea, that I travelled for the 1st and last time. Their system did not work for online check in for the whole day before my flight so when i got at the airport to check in at their desk, they informed that i had to pay 30 euros to print my ticket. They will charge you extra money for no reason. And if you try to request a refund, as i did, they will refuse to give you a refund.

### "they do not want to refund us"
Not Verified |  We got canceled flight by the airline and they do not want to refund us, although in their policy is written "If the flight gets canceled by our airline, you can get a refund, voucher or change of date". Their Customer Service is the worst, they never reply, they are not competent enough and you have to wait more than a week to receive reply for an email. There is no other way than to sue them to receive a refund. Horrible experience, I do not recommend to fly with this airline!

### "flight compensation claim was raised"
My flight from Madrid to Nantes on 1st July 2019 was delayed more than 8 hours due to technical fault of the plane. No care or help provided on the ground as per EU Regulation 261/2004. Delayed flight compensation claim was raised on the 11/07/2019 and till now no money or explanation given by Volotea why they are refusing to issue the payment. Customer service is simply non existent.

### "terms and conditions for refund"
Kidding people with fake flights. Initially I have booked and paid (a sufficient amount of money) for a combo plus flight from Athens to Rhodes on 24th  April. As coronavirus situation was widespread worldwide the flight was cancelled. I received a voucher for that and I rebooked a flight for the 10th of May. Unfortunately this flight was cancelled as well and the other options for the same company are only for the 29th and the 31st of May. Do you assume that all people travelling to Rhodes are tourists? As it's not my responsibility I have the legitimate to take my money back. Your terms and conditions for refund only in case of death or accident are ridiculous.

### "A very costly mistake"
Not Verified | Athens to Mykonos. Ripped me off! Overbooked the flight. I was left stranded in Athens. It cost me a new flight and a nights stay in Athens. When I asked for a certificate to give to my own insurance company to reimburse these costs, I was completely ignored for almost a year before giving up. Do not fly with Volotea!! A very costly mistake.

### "not trust this airline again"
Malaga to Nice. We booked with Volotea about 3 months ahead for flights from Malaga to Nice to return one week later. We then booked our hotel in Nice and about 1 month before we travelled we got an email from Volotea to say the flight dates had now been changed by 2 days either way which was was very inconvenient as I had arranged my holiday dates at work. I then contacted the hotel and they would not accept us to change our dates without additional costs and therefore we finished up having to pay another 400 euros for extra nights and as we were arriving 2 days late we were not refunded for the hotel nights we did not use. I would not trust this airline again and having read the reviews it seems that there are lots of unsatisfied customers so BEWARE.

### "we did not check in online"
We arrived early to check in counter for our flight from Santorini back to Athens. To our surprise check in agent told us we were being charged 30 euros each for three people in our party because we did not check in online at least two hours before flight and we didn’t come with printed boarding passes. This is the first time we were charged for not having boarding passes already printed with us。

### "Will never book a flight on this airline ever"
Our flight was delayed for 4 hours, told that there is a technical problem with the aircraft so the flight will resumed from 7.20am to 5.00pm, we were also told that if we need to get to our destination for connection we can book to another airline to catch our flight, they won't be able to deal with refunds on the ground and told to call customer service to file. We book another flight after the announcement as we don't want to be stuck in the Island for another day and we also miss our connection flight already in Athens. The only thing they did is givd us a €5 snack card. We paid extra for our carry on luggage as the sizing cage they use is smaller than the standard, and yes no refund as well on that! They will charge you for baggage if your luggage is a standard acceptable size that airlines normally accept, that is how they scam passengers! Though this bad experience it cost us €700 to reach our final destination. They did not refund us, they kept the money as if the delay was caused by the passenger! I read another passengers review for the flight they lost from Volotea on Sept 2019 and it was the same scenerio we encountered, they probably doing this as a business practice or they just really use poor aircrafts. Will never book a flight on this airline ever.

### "This was the worst situation"
Not Verified |  Alicante to Venice. They overbooked our flight, and instead of being helpful, the staff were rude and unprofessional. We were 5 people to be overbooked on the flight. They are refusing to reimburse the alternative flight i had to buy. I had heard they are famous for these kinds of issues, but i decided to give a it a try, and i feel like i was scammed. This was the worst situation i have ever had for a flight.

### "We were pleasantly surprised"
Not Verified |  Athens to Mykonos. We took 10 separate flights in 16 days and of all the flights this was the one I was expecting to be the worst based on the reviews I had read. We were however pleasantly surprised. Service at the gate was okay (although we boarded by bus and the priority boarding I had bought and paid for meant nothing, don't buy it .. its a rip off). Flight was on time, flight attendants relatively attentive, seats were okay. Deplaning went okay. Nothing spectacular but not the bad experience I was expecting.

### "Terminal changed at last minute"
We travelled from Athens to Santorini on Sep. 26th. We checked in and waited at the terminal. Terminal changed at last minute without clear notice. We was told only while we were about to board. We ran to changed terminal, flight had not yet departed, but staff refused to send us over due to too much troubles. We had to buy new tickets and arrived at hotel late. A clear terminal change notice should be air company's duty, Volotea didn't do their job properly and wasted our time and money. We also saw two groups of people occurred the issues as us. They complained they could not hear clear notice too. We required compensation for our financial lost, but Volotea just refused it and didn't bother to keep communicating with us. We do not know where we can complain and sort out our issues if we meet an airline just ignore us by stopping communication. How Volotea respond passengers definitely damaged the image of Greece.

### "very pleasantly surprised with the airline"
Not Verified |  Madrid to Nantes and back for a weekend break. Both planes were second hand A-319 aged +15 yrs (checked via aircraft registration number). Flight from Madrid was delayed for approx 45 minutes. Return flight was on time. Despite of the fact of the delay, I am very pleasantly surprised with the airline. It was my first time using it and I I had read some not too good reviews. Seats are very comfortable and with good legroom (much better than the subpar Iberia and better than Ryanair). They have a relaxed cabin luggage policy, which is something I appreciate (compared to the no sense Ryanair) and cabin crew isn’t intrusive at all as they allow the passengers to relax during the flight without trying to sell you all possible things. Moreover the price for the return ticket was extremely competitive. In short, I will fly again Volotea.

### "the price was excellent"
Lyon to Cagliari. The flight was on time and the service was as expected. No complaints and the price was excellent. Perfectly adequate for a low cost airline. The Euro 5.00 to purchase an extra 10kg luggage allowance was very reasonable. We purchased the Combo plus package that provided checked baggage, priority boarding, basic snack and booking flexibility. Very worthwhile.

### "gave me wrong info"
Not Verified | Athens to Heraklion. The agents gave me wrong info on the flex plan, and don’t even know the rules and regulations of their airline so I got some misinformation from two of their staff members and ended up having to spend approx $630US dollars because their staff doesn’t know what they are doing. When I brought that to their attention and tried to get refunds they blamed everything on me and told me their staff may have been wrong but it’s not their problem. They won’t let you talk to a supervisor and they are the rudest and ignorant people I have ever dealt with.

### "very pleasant and on time flight"
Preveza to Naples. Had a very pleasant and on time flight with Volotea. The thing that did not work was e-check in. We were two in this booking and attempted to do online check in the day before the flight, only to continuously get the notification that e-check in was not available and that we should proceed to the counter for traditional check in. We were a bit worried, because when this happened to me in the past it was due to overbooking (with other airlines). Volotea also states in their terms and conditions that e-check in is compulsory and failure to do so would incur charges. Anyway, on the counter we got emergency seats, we were seated together and they also offered to check in our hand luggage. So, apart from lining up it was pretty good and smooth. Other than that, it was typical low cost service, although well organized, neat and timely. Flight was about 90% full, almost entirely of Italian holiday travelers. Aktion airport was also small and nice and I enjoyed this flight.

### "seats in the low cost standard"
Not Verified |  Cagliari to Verona. Good flight, seats in the low cost standards but better than the Ryanair ones. Also they don't try to sell you everything they have, in fact if you want something you have to go and ask them. Flight with a bit of turbulence but quiet. buon volo,sedili negli standard delle low coast ma migliori di quelli ryanair. inoltre non cercano di venderti tutto quello che hanno anzi se vuoi qualcosa glielo devi andare a chiedere. volo con un pò di turbolenze ma tranquillo.

### "delay of more than 6 hours"
Santorini to Athens. Worst airline ever with delay of more than 6 hours that ruined our whole schedule for that day. Wasted almost a day for the the route from Santorini to Athens which should have been just an hour. No proper explanation was made and were only given some voucher for food during the wait time. Such a waste of time.

### "the personnel was very friendly"
Pula to Bordeaux with Volotea. Very pleasant flight. Check in at the airport was fast (unlike other airlines, it wasn’t possible to get our boarding pass ahead of time). The aircraft was clean and comfortable and the personnel was very friendly. I especially loved the smooth landing - not all pilots know how to land a plane that smoothly. An experience to repeat!

### "Plane in good condition"
Malaga to Nantes with Volotea. Flight departure on time. Plane in good condition. Seats not especially comfortable but still good, enough room for legs (taking into account that it's a low cost company). Special luggage (sports, bicycles) quite expensive and treatment not especially good, not big problems though.

### "crew was amazing"
Munich to Zaragoza. Great airline. Check in was very efficient and quick despite there being only one counter open, boarding was super fast. We arrived 20 Minutes early and the crew was amazing.

### "Very bad experience"
Olbia to Naples. Very bad experience, poor quality customer service. We've been charged 30 euro per person for their system error as we could not check in online before our trip due their system error. When we approached customer service they said we should take a screenshot of the error, otherwise we need to pay. I highly not recommend to fly with Volotea, was my first and last time. Also is nothing stipulated in their terms and conditions that if you don't check in online you will have to pay at the airport. Very bad company.

### "no refund still"
Mykonos to Athens. Worst airlines. Delayed flight up to 9 hrs and no refund still. Do not go with them.. Their planes have technical issues. Not worth it. Customer and ground team are horrific.

### "Enjoyable trip"
Turin to Cagliari. Enjoyable trip. Schedule perfectly on time. Friendly staff. Prices were also under average. It was definitively worth. Airplane are not that new, and seats are very close to each other but less than other carriers.

### "staff very kind and helpful"
Catania to Genoa. I'm satisfied about price, punctuality and online check in of this company. Onboard staff very kind and helpful. Premium services such as priority access and a snack were high value.

### "Service is non-existent"
Naples to Santorini. Hopeless worst experience ever. At checkin the staff stormed off maid checkin. Got to Santorini and they lost one of our bags. It contains many mementos of our trip, that we will not see again. Service is non-existent, they abrogate all responsibility, could not care less. We spent three days trying to chase them and they won’t even talk to you unless five days past, blame the airports. No offer of assistance or even any sympathy. I would consider any alternate form of transport before I used them again. The quicker they go broke the better.

### "the flight was perfectly fine"
Not Verified |  Naples to Cagliari. After booking I noticed that the luggage fees for this airline are terrifying. If your hand luggage is over 10 kilos you get charged 60 Euros and your luggage goes in the hold. While Alitalia allows 23 kilos; Volotea restricts luggage to 20 kilos. Every kilo over is 12 Euros. Fortunately for us the check in lines were so long they had no time to charge us. Otherwise the flight was perfectly fine. However we got no drink nor a snack as we decided not to pay extra for a 50 minute flight. Crew were polite and the flight was full. I did pay a little extra for a seat with some extra legroom. The legroom on the cheapest sears is atrocious. It's worth paying a few Euros more for decent legroom which looked like 32 inches. Their web site was somewhat confusing when purchasing my tickets. They were offering a special deal with a snack. I missed this opportunity. I was able to get our boarding passes with no problem on their web site. Volotea is a Spanish airline but the crew were Italian.

### "disgrace to all airlines"
Venice to Athens via Mykonos. Booked a flight for 9th July on 5th June. Tried to do online check-in 11+ hours in advance, got an error saying "Check-in is no longer available". Spent nearly 2 hours trying every possible channel to find out how, what, when. Finally got through to an advisor on website chat - told the system decided to add a free airport check-in for me. Go to check-in desk 2 hours prior to departure. One receptionist checking everyone in - I'm 10th in the queue. After 40 minutes of standing in a queue, it's my turn. After 30mins of watching the girl faff I finally get a boarding pass but get told that the flight is overbooked, my boarding pass doesn't have a seat allocation, I need to wait until everyone boards the plane and will only be allowed on-board if someone doesn't show. So I book and pay 1+ month in advance, show up in time, do the check-in, have my personal itinerary, other transport and accommodation booked and then get told I might get denied the flight because the company is making money selling more seats to flights than they actually have and hoping people won't show! Speechless. I got to board eventually but not without witnessing proper rude behaviour towards another passenger. The flight was 30 mins late to land but that didn't even factor into my whole experience and feeling heavily overwhelmed even before my holiday had started. Especially since I had another flight with Volotea pending 4 days later. So 4 days later, flight from Mykonos to Athens scheduled in for 11:20. No issues checking-in this time. Get to the gate - delay. Screen's saying an update in an hour. After an hour, estimated departure is 13:31. After an hour, it changes to 16:06. Some of us are already gone - bought other tickets or took the ferry so as not to miss their connecting flights. Luckily, my connecting flight was for the next day. I was meant to spend the day in Athens, instead, I spent it on a chair in an airport that is so tiny that even the check-in desks are outside. Out of curiosity I had a look at the flights from the previous day - 4 out of 5 Volotea's flights to Mykonos were late. Some tendency here, no? Finally, after waiting nearly 5 hours, we fly out at 16:11 to do that 40 minute flight to Athens. We land at 16:55. Instead of 12:05. Thank you for those airport food and drink vouchers Volotea but how am I meant to get back the time you robbed me off? How are you going to take back the stress you've caused to all your paying customers? Luckily, at least I am done with the stress of having to fly with Volotea, and you'd assume done with it altogether but no - getting emails asking to leave feedback, received 21 text messages between 5am and 7:30am asking to follow a link and leave feedback. Well, Volotea, you wanted some feedback? Here it is - you are a disgrace to all airlines, your systems don't work and your staff are rude and ignorant. Out of 5 flights I took last week, 2 were with Volotea and both were disastrous. Never flew with them before, never will again. Low fares are a good way to attract people but the way this company operates is deplorable, constantly late and overbooking flights. My advice is for improvement, Volotea, is that you should just give up and go be something else than an airline because you're not good at it.

### "Worst service ever"
Venice to Mykonos. The flight was due to leave Venice at 20:20. After a first boarding that failed, we were boarded late and left Venice at 23:30. They just said: “technical break issues are solved, we can leave”. Once took off, after 20 min the captain said: deicing system is not working; we return immediately to Venice. Then, with no more explanation nor info, we landed in Venice after one hour. After request for explanation, rude steward could only say ”I hope the captain will announce anything”. We could be given hotel room after quarrelling and police calling only at 04:00 am. The flight was replaced the day after, at 18:50. But no information at all were given. Only the airport helped. Worst service (not to be called service) ever.

### "not doing an online check in"
Athens to Santorini. I was charged 60 euros (30 for my ticket and 30 for my partner) for not doing an online check in as requested inside a long email that was sent to my email after booking.

### "Beware dealing with this company"
Vienna to Bordeaux with Volotea. This airline isn't worth any more of my time, so this will be short and sweet. The owner of this airline, should stop opening different businesses and focus on the ones he has until they aren't completely incompetent. I paid for their "insurance" so I could change my reservation if I needed to because I"m traveling with no real time constraints. Well after changing my flight 2 days ago, I got an email saying that my flight (the original flight that was supposed to have been changed 2 days ago) was delayed. When I contacted them to ask why my flight wasn't changed like the website said it was, they told me sorry, and it was now too late to change flights, and thanks for my money. Beware dealing with this company, they will rip you off when given the chance.

### "lack of response is the worst"
Athens to Heraklion. After 40 years of constant flying experience how can one review an airline on which he has not flown. However their overall response and attitude have been worse than anything I could ever imagine. I was booked to fly on 4254 on June, 6 however two days before the flight I advised Volotea via email that due to serious medical reasons I was not allowed to fly and requested the courtesy of their reply to a) if I can change the date of my flight b) if I get any full or partial refund c) if i get the return of taxes paid d) if I am entitled to nothing... Being hospitalised, I have sent four (4) reminders requesting the favour of a reply however all my requests have been totally ignored and no single reply has to this moment been received. Their complete lack of response is the worst and most inhuman experience I have ever had. Never in my life have I felt so frustrated with such an impolite so called airline...

### "keep asking to size the luggage"
Athens to Santorini. The crew was unfriendly. Everything disordered, from check in to on board. They keep asking people to size the luggage, even with obviously standard on board case. No any service at all. Well they are cheap airline, you get for what you pay. But I didn’t see a cheaper rate compared with others. I will never take their flight anymore. Not recommended to others either. They have the worst online system and if accidentally click on other seats, you can not cancel it and will ask for payment.

### "take others and not Volotea"
Not Verified |  Mykonos to Athens. Volotea failed to transport passengers from origin to destination. The flight from Mykonos to Athens on 6th May at 7pm was cancelled. Upon cancellation, they did not offer any backup flight on the same day or next day. We are stranded on Mykonos and was anxious because we need to catch any international flight at Athens on the next day. Next morning, they put us on a ferry that takes 7 hours to reach Athens and told us to go to Mykonos port to collect the ferry ticket.Ferry departs at 1415hrs and reach Athens at 7pm. However, the ferry office said Volotea did not make such booking for us. We have to pay for own ferry ticket at our own cost. After the incident, we wrote to Volotea for refund since they did not put us on the plane at all. They refuse to refund (70 euros) and stated that it was under unforeseen circumstances that they cancel the flight. They also did not pay for the ferry ticket (38euros) upon producing the receipt. Their customer service even claim that this was no show initially, instead of a flight cancellation. This is really the most non-reliable airline and bad customer service. There are other airline serving Mykonos to Athens - pls take others and not Volotea. Do not let this airline spoil your schedule or holiday.

### "30€ per pack for check in"
Mykonos to Athens. Rude service crew at check in counter. Charge extra 30€ per pack for check in, only mentioned no charges if booked online but we are not allowed to do so as they helped to check in. Extra charges for bag that couldnt possibly fit in the small box provided. End up, total extra charges of 110€ due to their greedy policy.

### "flight was perfectly fine"
Toulouse to Prague. Having read negative reviews, our particular flight was perfectly fine. We were notified well in advance, (3+ weeks) of a 25 minute change in flight departure time, which made no material difference to travel plans. It's a low cost carrier, and did what it said on the tin. Maybe it would have been different if they cancelled but we did not have that experience. Cabin crew maybe needed to speed up a bit, but overall a cheerful experience

### "ridiculous hidden fees"
Santorini to Athens. Out of the 45+ airlines i flew with, most of them are "budget" airlines, this is the far worse. First, the excruciating booking process is full of ridiculous hidden fees. While boarding the plane, they randomly chose passengers to try fit their carry-on bags to their tiny sizer and nailed them with a 60 euro fee. If they wanted they could screw half of the passengers but they knew it will lead to a mutiny. I personally was forced to check a bag that meets all international size standards and traveled with all over the world without any issue, including another Volotea flight just 3 days earlier. I had to go back to the check-in counter, go through security again and delay the whole flight because of their greedy luggage policy. Of course they checked my girlfriend's bag too for no cost, even though there was plenty of space in the cabin. It wasn't a matter of safety, just pure greed. And no, playing Bob Marley in the PA system didn't make us "get together and feel alright". The actual flight was fine and the crew was ok.

### "changed times to 3.5h earlier"
Not Verified | Athens to Crete. Worst customer service ever. They advertised a flight and we purchased that flight and made the rest of our reservations accordingly. Several weeks later they e-mail me that the flight had changed times to 3.5h earlier than our original time. This was impossible for us to accept because our flight from the U.S.A. arrived after this. I explained the situation to them and ask for help to locate another flight that would work with our schedule. I sent 3 messages trying to get help. It took 5 days for them to respond with no help at all. They know the airlines that fly from Athens to Crete, we don't they could have at least told us an alternative airlines to try. Now we have had to find another airline and pay a lot more money. I feel that the least they could do is pay the difference it has cost us between the two flights.

### "refuses any compensation"
Bordeaux to Madrid. This company charges for luggage which it did not deliver and refuses not just any compensation, but also, at the very least, to refund the cost of the undelivered luggage. In my case, I had to go myself, on my way back, inside the lost luggage section of the airport airport to retrieve my lost luggage.

### "did not provide any help"
Me and my wife were booked to fly with Volotea Airline from Athens to Santorini on April 9, 2019. After much delay they announced flight cancelled. It was past 9 PM. Then did not provide any help such as hotel, rebooking with any other airline, or booking with same airline next day, but suggested 8 hour ferry ride next day morning. They gave us 2 Travelwelfare prepaid cards each worth 5 Euros as a compensation. But when we went to get something to eat we were told these cards are blank and there is no money in it. Beware of this airline. In my view they are Thugs. It is companies like VOLOTEA which spoil the name of Greece.

### "charge me for 1kg  extra luggage"
Nantes to Palma de Mallorca. They wanted to charge me for 1kg of extra pre-booked luggage, even though that their standard packaged 20kg check in luggage allowance is less generous than other low-cost airlines. Boarding took forever because they did not allow passengers to take their hand luggage on board, so these had to be checked in at the gate. Then a cabin crew insisted that I put on my jacket during landing, keeping it on my lap was not an option seated in the first row even though during takeoff this had not been a problem. €190 for a oneway 1.5 hour flight booked 1 week in advance is way too much for this lousy experience.

### "I know not to fly cheap airlines"
Majorca to Lyon. I know not to fly cheap airlines and this is just an exception because there’s no other flight for the date. Upon boarding, I encountered some rude cabin crews. There is obviously some language barrier but the attitude of the crews matches the price and value of Volotea. This is for sure the first and last time I fly Volotea. The airline incorrectly charged me twice for the same ticket. Still hoping to get half of the payment back.

### "uninterested crew on board"
Santorini to Naples. This was by the far worst flight experience I have ever endured. For starters the check in experience/the airport at Santorini is horrific, no signs indicating where to go and what to do etc. Despite the airport not being up to date our worst experience came in form of the "service" or rather lack of provided by the uninterested crew on board this flight. The flight staff were very rude and had no interest in doing their job. They took forever to get the paid food and beverage menu started on this flight and then conveniently skipped half the aircraft. We thought this would be a fairly priced flights till we ended up having to pay an additional 110 euros for luggage and seats.

### "Really good flight"
Santorini to Athens. Surprised. Really good flight. I read all the bad reviews after booking (did an airline safety search before booking but forgot customer satisfaction) and was expecting the worst. No issues at all.

### "confirming fitness to fly"
Figari to Strasbourg. The airline website says you need a "medical certificate confirming fitness to fly" from the 28-35 week of pregnancy - what is perfectly fine. But in the airplane - the certificate provided - they force the women to sign a document that releases the company and it's partners from any kind of liabilities in every case! (Not just concerning the pregnancy)  There is nothing about this in their conditions of carriage and its not right to do this - I don't know if it would hold anything in court. I guess if you don't sign, they refuse to transport. But as we were already in the air they could just make pressure with "we'll have to tell the captain". Never sign anything you don't want to, and let nobody force you to do so or put pressure on you

### "Very poor value"
Athens to Santorini. Very poor value! They charged us 70 euros for one extra bag which weighed under 10 kilos. Poor staff, rude, useless. Take any other airline if you can.

### "was easy and efficient"
Not Verified |  We flew from Naples to Palermo with Volotea and it was a thoroughly pleasant experience. Everything from the booking, to the smooth flight itself was easy and efficient. We had printed off our own boarding passes prior to the flight and deliberately kept our luggage within 20k. I carefully read all the paper work multiple times (inc small print) so was aware of the extra charges that we would incur if we hadn’t done these things. Volotea sent emails weekly reminding me of this too. All budget airlines operate in this way, and it’s how they reap back some of the money you save on flights. They are not the only ones! We were on the plane on time and after a little bit of a delay (airports fault not Volotea’s) we were up and away, landing on time in Palermo! Thank you Volotea for proving me wrong and I hope my feedback reassures other first time flyers with you. Everyone needs to remember to read their documentation before travel and that delays are often not due to the airline alone!

### "absolutely value for money"
Athens to Genoa. The flight was on time, boarding and de-boarding were made through an air bridge, and seat comfortable. Absolutely value for money! This airline is very underestimated-people must acknowledge that when they fly with low cost airlines must be very careful with their rules, for example checking in online or that their luggage meet the dimensions asked.

### "avoid at all costs"
Athens to Thira. Avoid this airline at all costs! I've flown a lot and this was the worst experience and worst company I've ever had to deal with. They cancelled our flight super last minute when everyone was already at the airport. Then, they wouldn't help anyone find any other flights and when we called customer service they said word for word "We can't help you you'll have to call back tomorrow". Now, fast forward 2 months and I'm still chasing them down for my refund! What an absolute joke and total scam. I will never fly this airline and I'll be sure to spread the word as much as possible and tell others to avoid it at all costs as well.

### "delayed for hours in a day"
Mykonos to Athens. Delayed for hours in a day, no information and lost my connecting flight. Even if they offered me free tickets, I would rather pay and receive the service that is expected in this day and age.

### "7 hours of delay"
Athens to Heraklion. After 7 hours of delay, they informed us that the flight was cancelled due to weather conditions. Strange when you see 10 seater aircrafts flying normally. But anyway regular airlines offer 2 options to their customers if their flight has been cancelled: 1) refund 2) schedule a new flight a bit later. Their options were not even options: 1) travel via ferry boat and arrive to our destination with a 2 days delay. 2) travel with the next available Volotea flight which was 2 days later and 3) refund only our ticket but in reality we paid much more. So it will be better to consider what real airlines do, otherwise Volotea please leave Greece. You are not welcomed here! Thank you for ruining my vacations!

### "not recommend this airline"
The flight from Athens to Santorini was normal and organised with quick check-in and luggage holding process. We traveled around Europe with our normal size hard case cabin luggages, which was accepted to put on hold for free with all other airlines, as well and with Volotea flight from Athens to Santorini. However, the return flight from Santorini to Athens was chaotic, with disorganised boarding procedures and they made us paid for excess luggage nearly to the end of the boarding process. We had to quickly ran outside to pay for the fines and went through security again, which almost made us missed the flight. It is absurd that they accepted our luggage earlier but made us pay fines on our way back! The two luggage were exactly the same sizes as they were. Although they did let several backpackers took out their belongings and gave to their friends just in order to stuff their backpack into the measuring box. There were plenty cabin spaces on the airplane as well, which has made us feel even more frustrated that we had to pay €120 unreasonably. We tried to contact the airline but still has no replied from them. Would not recommend this airline to anyone unless you want to ruin your holiday last minute.

### "I am very disappointed"
Cagliari to Genoa. I am very disappointed because the airline didn’t make clear in their email alerting about my flight that I had to print in advance my boarding pass. I had to pay a conspicuous sum compared to the cost of the ticket. I am sure they have some information on their website but they are not clear enough toward their customer considering they send several email trying to sell other services. They should write in capital letters and in the first lines that you have to print your boarding pass. In addition we had to wait long time before boarding in the bridge (very hot) connecting the airplane to the gate.

### "cannot recommend this airline"
Me and my friend went to Athens airport 2 hours before our departure and were not able to check in for our flight from Athens to Mykonos as there was an error on their website (and the check in is not possible with the check in machines at the airport.) So we went to the counter to do the check in. The customer service was awful and nobody wanted to help, all they said that it is our fault we hadn't done the check in even tho we tried to show on our phone that the website wasn't working. They told us we had to go to the ticket sale desk and pay extra 30 euros to get our boarding passes. For some people they asked 40€ and some people they asked 30€. We still had good 45 minutes till the departure but at the ticket sale counter there was only one person selling the 30-40 euro boarding passes and even tho we tried to explain we are in a rush, so was everyone else and I believe more than 10 people missed their flights because of this. We missed our flight and had to buy other tickets - from different airline obviously. Of course on their website in the FAQ section it is stated that the check-in will have to be done 4 days before the departure which is very odd and I haven't seen any other airline do it. If it's not done 4 days before it is not possible to do anymore and you will have to queue at the ticket sale counter at the airport and pay extra to get the boarding pass (and if there is a queue, you will probably miss your flight) All and all the airline and it's "customer service" was terrible and I cannot recommend this airline to anyone.

### "prices where higher"
Mykonos to Athens. I made my girlfriend a megavolotea member by paying 50 euros per year. It supposed to give her better flight prices than the non megavolotea members. In the same time i have a simple non megavolotea account on their site. One day I checked the prices for the same flight-day - in her megavolotea account and in my non one - guess what, in my girlfriends "prime membership" account the flight's prices where higher than in my account. You can check it out if you want.

### "Don't fly with this airline"
Booked a flight with Volotea for travel between Nice and Split during a holiday. On the day of the flight visited their site to confirm the flight was still on time, not only had the flight been cancelled but completely scrubbed from the system. Zero communication from Volotea. Then we you need them the most you will search and search for any phone numbers, email addresses etc. Once you find them you'll never get through to a real person. All you will find is an FAQ section on their site. We spent 500 euros per person for a 2 hour one way flight to save our vacation. After getting home the communication is no better and we are no where near getting a refund of the original flight or any compensation for the replacement flight. Don't fly with this airline. Spend the extra couple dollars and fly with an airline that won't ruin your holidays.

### "dinged for every extra imaginable"
Santorini to Athens. You have to be out of your mind to fly this airline unless you need to go point-to-point on one of their arcane city pairs, eg: Venice to Santander. Don't think this is a budget airline - by the time you wind up getting dinged for every extra imaginable (and some unique ones) you pay more than you would with a legacy carrier. You must adhere to their baggage and boarding pass policy or you will pay dearly at the airport (60Euro per bag/30 Euro per boarding pass) and  they stand at the gate with a sizer and scale. The other issue is their reliability - due to their weird route structure, there isn't a real "hub" so if there are any mechanical or weather issues, you are done For example, they have one aircraft shuttling between Santorini and Athens with a listed 25 minute turn-around time and with only 20 minutes of taxi time built into the schedule.

### "they would not help"
❌ Not Verified |  Malta to Mallorca via Bordeaux. Terrible experience. First flight delayed two hours and we missed the Volotea connection. They could not get us to our final destination for two days and no offer of hotel or help with another airline. Called their customer service and they would not help and hung up on us. The first flight itself was fine once we left Malta but our experience with customer service was so bad we will not use them again. We incurred hotel expense and had to book with another airline to get to Mallorca.

### "a very good experience"
Excellent return flight Vienna to Bilbao, travelling as a couple with infant. Easy booking process, received regular email communications in advance of flight reminding us to check-in, friendly ground staff at luggage drop and boarding gate, decent smiling cabin staff, clean cabin despite the age of the 717, tolerable seats with reasonable leg room, reasonably priced on-board menu and flights on time/early. All-in-all a very good experience, a relief after reading some of the other reviews on here, and wouldn't hesitate to fly again or recommend. The trick - as with all LCCs - is to be prepared and very carefully read and adhere to the rules re. baggage, boarding passes etc.

### "One of the worst flights"
Flew Volotea from Nice to Strasbourg. Airline extremely disorganized, boarding took far longer than normal. We ordered "plus seats" online which promised priority boarding, seat selection, and a snack onboard, however, we did not receive any snacks and there was no priority boarding. One of the worst flights I have ever taken.

### "not worth the frustration and bureaucracy"
Flew Volotea from Athens to Santorini. Avoid this airline if you can. Pay a little bit more and use Agean or Olympic. How they scammed me for extra fees: If you don’t check in online and if you have a bag then you will pay more money then your ticket is worth. They price all their tickets a little lower then everyone else but if you don’t follow their strict rules hidden in their terms of use then you get surprised with fees at the airport. Stay away. It’s not worth the frustration and bureaucracy.

### "never again, total shambles"
Malaga to Bordeaux. Total shambles as many others have reported. Its seems to be deliberate policy to bounce passengers at the gate and it appears it is those who have not paid to choose a seat. I was left stressed for a long time and several times told yes / no even to be turned off the plane when boarded just to be pulled back again. When we all sat (there were 6 of us) there were 4 empty seats. Never again, total shambles.

### "Very stressful time waiting"
Flew Volotea from Santorini to Venice. Awful, Awful, Awful. I was told at check-in at the airport I was an overbooked passenger and that I would find out at the gate if I would be able to board the plane or not. Flight was 1 hour late, 7 other passengers were also with the 'overbooked status'. Very stressful time waiting for 2 hours at the gate and very bad boarding process. Last minute we all got seats but was an awful experience. First and last time I will fly with them.

### "performed as scheduled"
Nice to Pau. Flight was performed as scheduled on both trips. Checking (online and bagage checkin at airport) were OK. Boeing 717 is a bit old aircraft (noisy at the rear) but the cabin is OK, we had enough space for arms but not for leg. Flight attendants were nice but not really present because most of them do not speak french.

### "Extremely disappointed"
Mykonos to Naples. Extremely disappointed. I'm from the US, and currently work in Naples. I decided to take my damily to Mykonos for a few days. On the way back I found out I was overbooked and the rest of my family was fine. Second, while on a plane, I moved my seat to exit row seats so that it could provide a little more room for the rest of my family. I didn't realize that those seats were extra 20 euros. Ok, I understand if someone else was trying to purchase those seats, but out of 6 exit row seats, only 1 was occupied and I was instructed to return to my other seat. 2 recommendations I have for volotea: 1. In order to minimize overbooking inconvenience, look at other airlines who serve on a first-come-first-serve basis. I booked my flight months ago and was extra early at the airport, and still almost separated from my family. Keep families together! 2. Flight attendants don't need to be 'robotic'. If there are extra seats and nobody wants them, let the customers be happy! Tell them about policies but don't force them to change seats!

### "Terrible customer service"
Munich to Bordeaux. Terrible! Was not able to check-in in advance, called the office where I was told that this happens but everything would be fine. At the airport arrival I was denied boarding together with 6 (!) more passengers. No Volotea staff was there to help, only easyjet personel that was poorly informend from the Volotea head office. After 2 hours of waiting we were given the opportunity to take another flight. Unfortunately this alternative was a flight to Nantes the next day in the afternoon even though Air France had a flight the same day in the evening to Bordeaux. I ended up booking the Air France flight by myself instead since I was promised 350€ from Volotea's Head office. After a month of numerous calls and e-mails, I have not received any refund yet. Terrible customer service - would not recommend.

### "could not understand announcements"
Coming from Australia we booked our many airline tickets in Feb./March 2017. It was with much trepidation that I booked with Volotea after reading the many negative reviews about this airline but we wanted a direct flight from Santorini back to Venice and this was the only airline for that day. We flew to Santorini with Aegean from Venice and a required stop over in Athens for 4 hours - this became 5 as the Olympic Airline failed and we were relocated on another Aegean flight for the short trip to Santorini. Volotea was some 30 minutes late departing Santorini but this was due to this airport being the most chaotic and disorganised airport I have ever passed through (personal constraint prohibits me from using more profound language!). Once on board the plane departed quickly and arrived in Venice, albeit late. The male flight attendants provided a meal / drinks service and farewelled us as we left the aircraft. We could not hear nor understand announcements made in English by the female flight attendant. Could the female flight attendants at least smile a little rather than look at the passengers with a deadpan expression (perhaps it was a long day for them!)

### "worst airline company"
Athens to Santorini. The worst airline company. Had to pay extra as we didn't know to web check in, unhappy about it but did it. Got tickets and went through security and waited by gate. No announcement made that flight had been cancelled. After boarding time was overdue I checked board and Flight Cancelled. Went to Volotea helpdesk. Given a piece of paper and told to contact airline to get refund. I have contacted airline to get refund 3 times but they wont respond to any email I sent.

### "never fly with them again"
Avoid if possible! Going from Athens to Mykonos, we got a 2.30 hours delay, and on the way back, 30 mins delay. On top of that, the company asked us to check our cabin luggage because the aircraft was supposedly full when it wasn't! They took everyone's cabin luggage for no reason which resulted in an endless wait at the airport to get them back. I'll do my best never to fly with them again. Aircrafts were ok though. Round trip Athens-Mykonos.

### "Staff were not agreeable"
2-hour delay on my first flight from Luxembourg to Nice. Staff were not agreeable. Tickets not that cheap. Will not fly with Volotea again. The software they use to allocate seats to passengers in the plane is unefficient and we were all packed in different parts instead of being spread across the plane.

### "It was a new plane"
Bastia to Lille. It was a new plane and in general, this was a good flight thanks to the legroom (I'm 187). A negative thing was the punctuality. We had a delay of 1h15min, but we where on time in the plane (problem with the slots for the airlines). It's a good thing that the captain told the passangers about this and said right away how long that we needed to wait.

### "friendliness of the staff"
Lille to Bastia. In general, this was a good flight thanks to the legroom (I'm 187), the friendliness of the staff and the clear communication the days before your flight. Negative things are the check in process where there is written on the website that when you don't pay extra for the boarding pass you will have bad seats and will not sit together. Still, not too tactful to say this in this way

### "not interested in assisting us"
Catania to Venice. Our flight was delayed by 3 hrs 15 mins and we missed our Transatlantic flight which only operates on weekends. We were stranded in Venice and Volotea staff were not interested in assisting us in any way. We were sent from one end of the airport to the other for 8 hours and finally had to find a hotel overnight and pay for another flight via Istambul, which was very expensive and much longer. Volotea has refused to pay the EU outlined compensation and their e-mail advising us of this would not accept a response. We were very stressed when we were stranded in Venice without any assistance and would never use this airline again. They advertise 90% Customer satisfaction at the airport and on their website, but based on all the reviews posted here, their claim is very far from the truth. They do not even take time to respond to these negative reviews, which says it all!

### "service was quick and accurate"
I had booked with Volotea a few months ago. They informed me abiut 20 days before my scheduled flight that my flight from Athens to Mytilene was cancelled and to either get a refund or book another date, within one week from the original date, for free. This created some kind of fuss but their service was quick and accurate and we managed to pull it off. As for on flight, the plane arrived on time and it was a very pleasant trip. The crew were friendly and the aircraft relatively new (12 years old) and had low noise levels in the cabin. Overall a nice comoany to fly with, except for some handling problems. The value for money ratio is excellent though. Would fly again.

### "too late to use voucher"
Strasbourg to Nice. The first time I flew with Volotea, my luggage was delayed and it took 6 months to receive the compensation on my bank account. When I flew from Strasbourg to Nice, Volotea informed me less than one month prior to my trip that the dates had to be modified. Instead of flying on the Thursday, I had to fly on the Friday. Either I accepted the changes and could get a voucher of 20% valid for 180 days as a (tiny) compensation or I could cancel my flight all together. I chose to fly anyway and got the voucher. Recently I booked a flight from Strasbourg to Palermo and I did not see at first where to put the voucher for the payment. I paid anyway and immediately contacted customer care. They told me that it was too late to use the voucher because I already paid. I will not be able to use my voucher before its expiry date and they refused to make an exception or to send the money to my bank account.

### "blatantly arrogant and rude"
Palma to Southampton. I was delighted to learn of this new airline from Southampton and booked 2 holidays for the summer. The first was on time leaving Southampton in July but delayed 2 hours on return frustrating but no big deal. The second was delayed 2 hours going out and 3.5 hours coming home. Not once was the offer of refreshments and when I asked for a complimentary drink on board a very rude attendant said no. After the experience I submitted a claim for the legal compensation of 250 euros each passenger. After a few emails I was offered 50 euros each. We decided to accept given our flights were very cheap and provided all bank details. 3 months on and many emails sent with no response I still haven't received compensation. This company are so blatantly arrogant and rude, with zero knowledge of customer services. Please don't use them if you want to arrive on time and to be treated with the respect you deserve as a paying customer.

### "stay away from this airline"
Bought a ticket in August, for a Venice-Prague one way in November. Tried to check in online this week, five days before the flight: this did not work, with a cryptic error message. Wrote a mail to customer service, asking what is going on, and why I can't check in. Was curtly told via mail "your flight has been cancelled, that is why". Phoned customer support to ask how come they did not tell me earlier. Spoke to a rather unhelpful and arrogant lady who told me that they had sent an e-mail announcing the cancellation, back in September. However, for professional reasons, I usually keep track of all incoming mail: and as far as I can see, there simply was no mail from them to that effect. And I have to yet figure out whether they actually refunded the money, as they said they had. Based on this experience: save yourself trouble, and stay away from this airline.

### "yet to receive the refund"
Athens to Santorini. Volotea changed my original flight time from 11:15am to 8:15pm. Via email, we were offered the option to receive a refund. At this point in time, it has been 3 months and I have yet to receive the refund. I have called Volotea via Skype numerous times and the representative has promised that I would receive my refund, but this has not happened. I have sent countless emails, contacted them via Facebook, and still there is no resolution. This is unacceptable.

### "customer care is really poor"
Athens to Santorini. Arrived in Santorini to find that my luggage wasn't on the plane. Their was no assistance at all at the airport. Had to stand in a queue for 2 hours to be told luggage could take up to three days to arrive. Had to buy replacements and clothes. When I came home I made an insurance claim and have not had a single reply. I spent 300 euros on just basic items. Find their customer care is really poor, only alternative was of contacting is phoning a number in Spain which is ridiculous.

### "they cancelled all flights"
Split to Bordeaux return. After they had promotion and sold tickets for 6,99€ each way for autumn flights, they cancelled all flights they sold for that price. And let us know 20 days before departure after we booked all our accommodation and passes. So much money wasted because of them. And they don't even respond on e-mails after that.

### "experience was very good"
We had a good flight with Volotea from Split to Venice on 22nd September 2016. Flight was on time and arrived 15 minutes early. I did pay extra to select seats and print boarding passes which I never do with Easyjet, Volotea's add ons do seem expensive. Cabin crew seemed nice and all announcements were in English. The leather seats were comfortable and spacious. We had 1 coffee and a very tiny cake. Its a short flight, it is the only flight from Split to Venice, so I am not sure what we would have done if there had been a problem.Were were in row 6 and did not find the plane noisy at all Our experience was very good, I would use Volotea again.

### "customer service is terrible"
I flew few times with Volotea from Munich to Nantes and the trip was always pleasant. The A319 seemed to be pretty new and cabin staff very friendly. They have regular promotions and the prices can be very attractive. That was it for the good side of this airline! Booking is complicated as you try to avoid buying any extras. The extras are very expensive: check-in luggage would have costed around 60€ one way(! ), checking in at the airport costs about 30€. The customer service is terrible. They cancelled flights for my family 5 weeks before departure and only want to refund the tickets without offering a re-routing, which is a legal requirement (Regulation No 261/2004). Their telephone hotline is not willing to help and they replied to my e-mail almost a week later refusing the re-routing I demanded. What a pity when you have great cabin staff and competitive prices.

### "never heard of and wished I hadn't"
Palma to Southampton. I can echo the review of L.Talbot (UK) 11/7/2016. Our flight on the 4/6/2016 was also delayed for nearly five hours with total lack of info. We also had people bussed out to a plane which they couldn't find. We put in a compensation claim on Monday 6/6/2016 to Customer Care and received an automated acknowledgement and reference number. I have contacted them on several occasions mainly getting the automated response but once received a reply from Amilie in Customer Care asking for scanned passports / boarding passes / letter of authority signed by my wife confirming I could act for her. These were E-mailed by return. Still waiting 3 months on for courtesy of a reply. My experience has been poor to say the least. I booked package holiday with Thomsons and ended up with third party carrier in Volotea who I had never heard of and wished I now hadn't. Thomsons are culpable in my opinion but have washed their hands. Volotea / Thomsons give them a miss.

### "suggest to avoid flying with them"
Venice to Catania. My husband and I were denied boarding due to overbooking and after a very unpleasant experience with Volotea staff were offered a later flight and compensation for the flight denial. Paperwork was provided and we boarded a later flight, tucked into the last squashed row, after initially paying extra for seat allocation, and missing out tour departure in Sicily. We planned to use the compensation for the taxi we needed to use to catch up with our tour, and since arriving home in July and sending over 10 emails with the required information for the compensation Volotea continue make excuses and promise compensation and the not pay. Please take heed - if Volotea promise compensation for flight denial due to overbooking, demand it immediately. They are dishonest and unreliable. I suggest to avoid flying with them!

### "there was plenty of room"
I had a slight though somewhat expected apprehension when I heard that a new 'low cost' airline was flying from my local airport and offering cheaper flights than from one of the 'main' airports but I have to say the whole experience has been absolutely sensational. Southampton airport was lovely and clean and small and efficient. The airline itself left on time and had a fantastic laid back and relaxed ambience about it, great for the start of a holiday. The flight wasn't full so there was plenty of room to move around and it felt like there was lots of space. Most surprisingly though, the leg room and the seat width was excellent. I am a 'Big Girl' and normally have the embarrassment of asking for an extender belt but not on this flight. It was so lovely not to be wedged in and uncomfortable. There was a delay on returning home of about 2 hours and apart from the usual lack of information from staff at the airport (thank goodness for Google) we were told by the returning pilot that it had been due to an unsafe plane. Under the circumstances, a brilliant turnaround and as safety is paramount, any delay should be tolerated. I would happily recommend Volotea.

### "never fly with Volotea again"
I bought round trip Athens to Santorini ticket of Volotea from a travel agency. It included one luggage 20 kg (my luggage was 13 kgs). On my way to Santorini from Athens at the airport, I was charged 30 Euros, because I didn't have a printed copy of boarding pass. I had my boarding pass printed on my return from Santorini to Athens, this time they charged me 40 Euros because luggage information was not seen on the boarding pass. Total cost was 70 Euros: actually this is one way ticket cost. I was so disappointed. I will never fly with Volotea again.

### "no cleaning between flights"
London Southend to Palma (and back) on 2 and 9 July 2016. Upon boarding the gorgeous looking plane we were "welcomed" by a disgruntled stewardess who didn't seem to have bothered to fix her hair that morning, not to mention her makeup. Later we found out that she was the cabin manager. She was not only rude to some of us showing some attitude with her spanglish but what I really believe was unacceptable was to tell off her colleagues in front of the passengers. The rest of the crew were dedicated and doing a good job despite their horribly outdated uniforms. Seats were comfortable enough but the floor was dirty - no cleaning between flights. Only two tiny toilets at the back for more than 100 passengers. Queue to use them stretched along the aisle. Volotea is a strictly "no-frills" spanish airline. No inflight entertainment of any kind - not even a magazine rack. No seat-back pockets (like Ryanair) and a very small selection of food and drinks for purchase. Both flights departed and landed on time. One week later on our way back, the attendant by the door was nicer than his female colleague but he didn't seem to speak english at all. As I stepped on the plane I asked him how long the flight would take and he said "-Excuse me?". I asked him again but he just checked our boarding cards and told me and my wife our seat numbers. He seemed too anxious and just kind of wanted to push us inside. Fortunately, the other attendants were english speakers and took better care of us. I'll try to avoid them in the future anyway.

### "no meaningful updates"
Our 17.05 flight from Majorca (Palma) to Southampton on June 29 was delayed by 4 hours 40 minutes. Volotea provided no meaningful updates whilst we waited, and at one point we were bussed out to a plane only to find that it had a problem and we were returned to the terminal. The ground staff had no more information than us. A replacement plane was eventually found and we finally took off 4 hours 40 minutes late. Our claim for compensation was made on 30 June, and acknowledged by Volotea the same day, since then silence. I have requested an update but still no reply. Volotea may be about to lose a customer.

### "stuck in a foreign country"
After our flight was initial delayed by 30 minutes it was then cancelled. There was very little communication about what was happening and they could only offer us a different flight leaving the next day from a different airport, which would have result in us missing all our connecting flights. We were then stuck in a foreign country with no phone, internet, help or assistance from Volotea. Eventually airport staff helped us get new flights costing us 3000AUD. Volotea told us to make a claim online to get a refund for the cancelled flight. I made the claim and after not hearing from them for 2 weeks, I called them and was told I had to make the claim through my travel agent because they booked the tickets. So frustrated that it took so long to be told this. Our only saving grace is we had travel insurance to cover the out of pocket cost.

### "disappointed with the airlines check in policy"
Athens to Santorini with Volotea. Very disappointed with the airlines check in policy. They charge 30 Euro to check in at the airport if you do not check in online at least 2 hours before the flight. As I did not book my flight I was unaware of this nasty surprise at the airport. I feel this large fee for a mere simple checkin is completely unacceptable. It takes a minute to check a person in, yet a fee that is third to half of your flight ticket is charged. If you have to charge for airport checkin (which I personally find ridiculous) then charge a more reasonable amount. I feel as a Volotea customer and for choosing the airline one should not feel robbed by them to check in with a ticket one has already paid for. Just disappointed in this policy.

### "large comfortable seats"
Having read other reviews I was delighted with Volotea for flight from Southampton to Majorca. On time, plane clean and large comfortable seats. Food and drink available on board at very reasonable prices and polite air crew. I had to cancel one of our flights and sadly the tone of airline employee on the phone was rather rude and one of ground staff in Majorca said couldn't move my adult daughters seat (the seat was empty). Other than that first rate.

### "cabin crew were extremely friendly"
Flight Munich-Mykonos-Munich. Both flights with Volotea were on time, the return flight landed even 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Old Boeing 717, fun to fly but get a seat in the front as the back is indeed quite noisy. Cabin crew were extremely friendly. Very good experience overall for the money spent.

### "no explanation or apology"
Santorini to Naples with Volotea. Worst experience ever. The plane arrived on time however we were delayed for 2.5 hours and missed our connecting flight. Stranded at the airport with no help from Volotea. The entire time we were delayed we received no explanation or apology. Once we boarded we found out the reason for the delay on a beautiful sunny day - Wind, Even though all other flights were taking off and landing. I will never use this airline again

### "surprise for a low cost"
Montpelier to Nantes, and Volotea is a good surprise for a low cost! Like any low cost, you pay for everything, but the staff was great, the plane clean, good price for the Christmas/New year season. We almost left on time, but had a 20 mins delay, quickly informed by the pilot. Got a bad seat as it has no window (last row, corner), which can make you sick if not used to it. I flew with other low cost in Europe and Volotea was the best in its class.

### "worst airline I've flown "
Volotea is the worst airline I've flown with! Flew with my wife and 18 month old from Southend to Majorca in October 2015. Flying out, we were delayed by 3 hours and given no updates or explanation whatsoever. Then because we had been delayed, and once on the plane ready to take off we were advised that the crew's shift finished mid-flight and we would have to stop in Nantes to change the crew and refuel which took an additional 90 mins. Flying home, we were delayed by 2.5 hours as Volotea had forgotten to order our plane due to an 'operational oversight'. Absolutely shameful - basically there was also a flight on the same morning going to Southampton and Volotea thought this was the same as Southend therefore only ordered one plane. Crew were miserable, planes are shoddy, food is terrible - you're better off walking to wherever you're going.

### "hassle to get your money back"
The booking for Volotea is pretty easy, but tricky. Mind the hidden cost which can sum up. We were supposed to leave Prague on June 8 at 20.30. Due to some technical problems, the flight was delayed until about midnight. Then we were informed that the problem had not been solved and the flight will take place next day at 12.30 which it did. There was no support, help or assistance. We had to look for accommodation ourselves. No transportation service to the city was offered and the staff present was completely overwhelmed. Apparently they have no own staff at the airports they service! We ended up in paying for the transportation, hotel and meals and despite the information sheet which was distributed, the airline never ever responded to the complaint and to the request for compensation. As the hassle to get your money back is much more costly than the write-off and this is what this airline is playing with.

### "flight itself was good"
Booking hassle. The big problem was the online check in. We couldn't get our return cards before we left so had to get my 87 year old mother to print them for us! I don't think that all these extra ways (ie paying extra for a seat) of making money do you any favours. The reverse is true, it just annoys customers. With all the threats about the extra charges for boarding pass. I also didn't like this "join the club" offer when I booked, I simply couldn't work out if it was worth it? Then when I had booked it told me I could have saved money by joining the club, which just annoyed me more! Its a shame really as the flight itself was good and value for money.

### Volotea customer review
An old and noisy B717, if you have another option avoid this airline. The cabin looks good on pictures with colorful head rests, but the space between the seats is very limited. By the end of the 1 hour flight I had bruises on my knees. No service at all, on longer flights there is food for cash. We had 45 minutes delay (not their fault – air traffic problem) and they did not offer even a glass of water. Passengers were mostly young people, probably for their low prices.

### Volotea customer review
Thankfully, there was no line at the check-in counter, although the checked baggage weight allowance was only 20 kgs, causing me to move some items into my carry-on. There were busses to and from the plane at both airports, although given the rather short distance between the gates and the plane, I feel that it would have been more practical to walk. The flight was short and simple and crew seemed attentive, although I didn't buy any food or drink. Strangely, the cockpit door kept opening during takeoff. Overall, an okay low-cost airline. Just don't expect too much and know what you're paying for ahead of time. Even with a checked bag, it still cost less than a train ticket.

### Volotea customer review
I booked a flight that should depart at 22h55, a few days later they sent an email warning that the flight departure time would be delayed by 1 hour. On the day of the departure, however, the departure time was systematically delayed, first by one hour more, and then by another hour (3 hours extra not to mention the delay when boarding the passengers). When we arrived at the airport, there was no information of the flight on the screens. Moreover, although the check in should be open until 30 min before departure, they closed the check in with more than 1.5 hours before the flight departure. There was nobody to give any sort of information and, when I found a member of the staff walking in the airport, I had to run to try to talk to her and she just shouted at me saying she was not working anymore.

### Volotea customer review
Too noisy. The 717's are very noisy aircraft. Won't go with them again as our seats were at the back where the engines are situated. Moved to the front because of empty seats and still noisy. The Easyjet flight taken next day seemed bliss after that row. Comfortable in terms of nice seats and helpful staff.

### Volotea customer review
Boarding was a joke. They boarded passengers with children first, however it was to a bus so the kids ended up getting on the plane last. When we got on the plane they found a bag still left on the bus and asked if anyone owned it. No one did so after the crew had a discussion about it they put it in an overhead locker. A few people asked them to take it off the plane as it was unaccompanied luggage. The crew indicated that they were told it was OK. We again protested so eventually it was taken off as it should have been to start with. To top it off they were serving paid for drinks and snacks and were so slow that they only got half way down the plane (1.5 hour flight) and they had to stop as they were landing. So half the plane couldn't get a drink. Only one of the crew was at all friendly. Thank goodness the plane was reasonably comfortable.

### Volotea customer review
If I could give negative numbers I would. We attempted 3 times to check in online without success. Once we arrived to the airport and checked in there we were charged an extra 30 euro service fee for not checking in online. They did not seem to care that we had tried multiple times online with no success. Checking our bags was also more expensive because we paid at the airport instead of doing it online prior to arrival. By the time they were done with all of the extra fees, the total for the extra fees was close to what we had paid for our original ticket. They had our passports as we had given them to the agent in order to check us in, and we were told we could have them back once we paid the fees. I felt as if our passports were being held for ransom! To add to our experience the gate was changed without any notice or announcements. The only reason we found out about the gate change was because I approached the gate agent of the initial gate about why we had not started boarding and our flight was due to leave in 10 minutes. That was when she informed that our flight had changed gates and we should go there. Then our flight was delayed, thankfully for only 45 minutes or we would have missed our next connection. Overall it was one of the worst experiences I've had with any airline, and I will never fly them again.

### Volotea customer review
This is the worst experience I ever had with an airline. They changed the departure time (to earlier), then when we arrived for check in, delayed the flight an hour. Then, when the plane never arrived, they delayed it again for 7 hours, only offering a 10 euro restaurant ticket as compensation. This is completely unacceptable for an international airline. I will never fly with them again.

### Volotea customer review
I had quite a pleasant trip with Volotea last week. Flew GOA-CTA and back. Both flights were on time planes were clean and flight attendants friendly. Nothing to say about service and seat comfort: that was just what I expected from a low-cost airline. I was worried about my hand luggage being too heavy or big because I had read that they are very strict but they didn't even check it. I would recommend Volotea.

### Volotea customer review
We also flew from Belfast to Verona on the same flights as Stephen Bradshaw below. The facts are all the same as below we were travelling with a 4 year old with special dietary requirements and had not planned to spend over 10 hours in the airport. The most pleasant part of the flights was the return flight home with Air Malta who had to rescue us! We even had running water.

### Volotea customer review
We had the misfortune to be travelling to and from Verona out of Belfast. To begin with the plane was delayed for over two hours in departure and when had finally departed we discovered that there was very little in the way of refreshments. To add to the discomfort there was no water available to even flush the toilets let alone wash your hands. On the return flight we arrived in Verona to see that the flight was running to schedule with expected departure at the advertised time. The flight was initially delayed for 10 mins then 2 hours followed by a further 4 hours. For food and refreshments we were given a whole 5 Euro which could buy you a cup of tea or coffee and a croissant. Children and infants could only get tea or coffee. Bearing in mind that most of the passengers had been travelling since 9 am and the flight eventually departed at 8.30 pm. On the bright side Volotea had chartered a plane from Air Malta to bring us home. The staff were very pleasant and helpful except that Volotea had chartered them to fly us to another airport and did not provide us again with refreshments or snacks. many of the passengers did not reach their cars until well after midnight. I for one will most certainly not travelling with Volotea ever again.

### Volotea customer review
Venice to Olbia and back. My first trip with Volotea and it did not leave a good impression. Flight from Venice to Olbia was somewhat OK they did not inform us that there would be a 45 min delay until 10 min before scheduled departure. From Olbia to Venice - disaster! Our flight was scheduled to depart at 7.55 pm. When we arrived there was a notice of a 3 hour delay on the screens in the airport. A passenger checked the website of Volotea and our flight was rescheduled to fly at 2.45 in the morning. In the mean time Volotea rescheduled our flight to 5 in the morning! Then - another change in departure time: 2 pm! Those passengers who could afford to go a hotel went. Those like me stayed the night at the airport. There was also another scheduled Volotea flight at 11.10 the next morning but we were told we could not get on that plane. At 9 o'clock in the morning there was another delay and our flight was moved from 2pm to 3.30 pm that is when I had enough and demanded that they put me on the flight at 11.10 am. I think I was lucky because I was travelling alone so they could find me a seat. Olbia staff changed my flight ticket without any additional costs. But even this flight had a 40 min delay so it's a never-ending story. My recommendation for you: If you have nerves and time and you're very flexible with your traveling use Volotea.

### Volotea customer review
Flew Naples to Palermo May 15 and Palermo to Venice May 29. No frills service (no magazine or entertainment) but very good for short haul. Excellent cabin and ground staff. Helpful friendly professional. Didn't try food/drink on short flights. Computer problem boarding at Palermo but quickly sorted out by staff doing it manually. Recommended.

### Volotea customer review
LIL-NTE return. Great low cost with attractive prices the 717's were fitted with new leather seats. Crew friendly on both flights however the crew could give more technical information about the flight.

### Volotea customer review
VCE-JMK-VCE on B717-200. Both legs on time. Good Legroom and fairly comfortable leather seats. Baggage Drop both in Venezia and Mykonos quick and organized. They stick to the condition of carriage for both weight and dimension of carry on bags. Prices for food/beverage on par with other European Low Cost carriers. Quick delivery of bags both in Mykonos and Venezia. Will definitely consider flying again.

### Volotea customer review
Strasbourg to Bordeaux and from Nantes to Palermo Sicily. They have an all Boeing 717 fleet. Aircraft's are spotlessly clean and flight crew friendly and attentive. The only problem with Volotea seems that they can't put their act together. On January 2013 I was supposed to fly r/t from Munich to Nantes. 2 weeks before the flight they cancelled the route. In April they moved my June 24 flight to Palermo to June 25 and my June 21 flight from Munich to Bordaeux had a day and schedule change just a month before. At the airports in Strasbourg and Nantes each flight had at least a 3 hour delay and this was informed to passengers 30 minutes before scheduled departure. The handling agent staff seemed to be ashamed of even giving Volotea service. I would still give them a second chance only on routes were I could run and take a train in the event of a lengthy delay. Their routes are still very interesting.
