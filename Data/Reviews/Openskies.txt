### "customer service is poor quality"
Paris Orly to New York JFK. The worst airline company. Please do not travel with Openskies / British Airways. The customer service is poor quality and the food is horrible. We had a 6 hours delays and they did not worry about making accommodations for people who missed their connecting flight.

### "service seems to be falling apart"
Openskies service from Paris ORY to New York JFK seems to be falling apart. It's run with ancient 757s which, at least in the cabin, seem well past retirement age. The biz seats are tattered, incredibly cramped, without any storage space so that it's essentially impossible to get any work done. They are rock hard, with strange lumbar support, which might work for a night flight's sleep but left me with a painfully stiff neck after reading through the day flight. IFE is on an old, ratty iPad which barely functioned - both sound and picture faded in and out at times. The food and wine were fine and the flight attendants' service courteous; however, after lunch service, they disappeared. Two positive notes: the lounge at ORY, was comfortable and decently catered, and the service ran on time. I flew on air miles but if I had paid for the flight I would have been very disappointed with myself for not having opted for AF. BA should either scratch this run or bring it up to basic standards.

### "little concern for passengers"
Paris to Newark. I previously reviewed British Airways regarding the flight which left early without contacting us and the unhelpful ground staff who refused to help us because we didn't purchase our ticket with British Airways which left us, essentially, stranded in Paris Orly airport. Since then we have tried to rectify the situation only to find their staff lacking both a desire to be helpful and a professional approach to customer service. Their customer service is not user friendly to begin with having odd hours of operation and the wait time to get a representative was always over 30 minutes and then several times placed on hold where call would be disconnected. Having not received any satisfactory response to our emails or phone calls, a letter was written to the corporate office and sent certified mail. The letter was sent over 6 weeks ago and there has not yet been a response from British Airways. Unfortunately, British Airways seems to be an airline with little concern for their passengers or for their customers' satisfaction. This was our first time flying with British Airways. Sadly, it will probably be our last.

### "no difference with Economy service"
Paris Orly to New York JFKI reviewed this airline in Business Class some time ago, indicating that the "Biz Bed" which pretends to be a British Airways Club World First Generation bed (I doubt it) is by far the worst in the industry with absolutely no way to sleep. The Premium Economy seats have one advantage, they are the original seats of the "L'Avion" airline, an all "Business Class Light" airline which flew years ago between Paris and New York and provided excellent service. British Airways bought it and made it "Openskies", a 3-class extremely mediocre product. The now "Premium Economy" seats are still good for PE but they are old, tattered and with many functions not working anymore. The planes are ancient mainline British Airways Boeing 757s (25 years, it cannot be much less) where the interiors are not maintained at all. To find other airplanes in such horrible condition, one has to go to Africa and use the least reputable airlines. One can only hope, it is likely, that the airframes are in better condition than the interiors. Even the blankets (very old BA Club blankets) are dirty and smell. The Ipads provided for IFE are extremely dirty and their covers are in rags. As to the Premium Economy service, there is, apart from the seats, absolutely no difference with the Economy service at the back of the plane or with the most threadbare BA Economy service. The food is plain inedible, even worse than on BA World Traveller services to low revenue markets. Bring your sandwiches. The FAs are pleasant and they mean well, but there is not much they can do in such sad conditions.

### "should be ashamed of themselves"
I am writing this on behalf of my wife and her three month battle with British Airways. On January 22, 2017 my wife and her sister were scheduled to return home from Paris Orly to New York JFK on Air France flight 0032 after attending a family funeral in France. Air France cancelled that flight 2 hours before its scheduled departure and offered no options other than to book passengers on a flight the following day. They needed to return to New York on January 22, so they walked over to the British Airways counter at Paris Orly and bought 2 tickets for Openskies flight BA 8005 from Paris Orly to New York JFK. They were prepared to buy 2 one-way tickets since they only needed to travel from Paris to New York, but the ticket sales agent at the British Airways ticket sales desk recommended that they buy round-trip tickets instead, promising that they could easily get a refund for the second leg of the round trip by simply cancelling it at British Airways.com on their return to New York because the tickets were fully refundable premium economy tickets. The agent told them that purchasing round trip tickets and getting a refund for the second leg would be cheaper than buying one-way tickets. What happened afterwards was a nightmare. When they returned to New York and tried to do as they had been instructed, the British Airways website said would not allow them to cancel online and would they would have to call customer service. What followed was a travesty. My wife had multiple calls with British Airways customer service each time with a different person and was told who told me that the second leg of the tickets the agent had sold them were non-refundable, although the first leg of the tickets was fully flexible. She explained to them each time that that they would have had no need for any flexibility on the first leg since they were standing at the ticket counter at the airport getting on a flight that was to leave in 45 minutes. She also explained that the sales agent knew that they needed flexibility on the second leg of the trip which since the agent knew they fully intended to cancel. Indeed, knowing that he was selling them fully refundable tickets, the agent randomly selected a travel date for the second leg of the trip (February 20, 2017) without consulting them. As it happens, he selected a date on which my wife would not even be in New York to get on that flight because she would be out of the country on that date. In the following two months it has been a continuous back and forth correspondence with British Airways customer service culminating in two letters which basically stated that British Airways did not believe my wife and her sister, and saying there would be no refund and no more correspondence. My wife just wanted to move on and let this go, but after watching this on the sideline for the past two months not to mention being stuck with almost $2,000 in non refundable tickets, I felt I have to post this on her behalf. British Airways should be ashamed of themselves.

### "an unhappy customer"
New York JFK to Paris Orly. My main mistake may have been to choose the Business Class which has without a doubt the worst lie-flat seat ever conceived with abominable ergonomics and comfort. The original concept (L'Avion, before it was bought by British Airways) was that of an over-average Premium Economy like La Compagnie today, curiously launched 10 years later by the same entrepreneur. Critics claim that the L'avion planes were refurbished with the BA First Generation Lie flat seats, but I have never seen those on BA, even years ago. The seat is so bad that a duvet, a mattress, and a blanket are provided separately, which makes the whole thing unmanageable in such a cluttered space. Those who know" buy "Prem Plus", the middle class original concept (untested last night) which is so overbooked that the lucky (unlucky ?) ones end up upgraded to a seemingly inferior product. Add to this inedible food, a clumsy (separate) individual video system, no premium baggage delivery and a remote stand parking in Paris Orly and you get me, an unhappy customer unlikely to return. The cabin staff is OK when they grace you with their presence, but completely unseen during 5 of the 7 flight hours.

### "wreaked havoc on our vacation"
Orly to Newark with Openskies, ticketed through British Airways. My sister and I were returning from Barcelona through Orly Airport with a final destination of Newark, NJ. Our flight arrived at Orly Airport at 8:55 a.m. on Jan 19th. We had been unable to confirm our boarding passes in Barcelona for the next leg of our flight because the British Airways app would not allow it. Upon arriving, we proceeded to the British Airways counter only to find no associates present. We were instructed by another airline’s agent that British Airways only staff the counter two hours prior to a flight. We waited until they came to open the counter and were first in line to get our boarding passes. We stayed in the area until closer time for our flight. At approximately 13:10 we went through security check and entered the boarding area. Our ticket showed gate 31. We were at gate 31. There were gates A, B, C, D, E, and F. As we looked at the monitor, it showed that BA 8003, scheduled to depart at 13:40, had closed the boarding process. We immediately went to the gate and were told by the associate that the flight had already left the gate. It wasn’t even 13:20! This was a flight scheduled to depart at 13:40 and this is the time showing on the monitor. The associate at the gate told us he would take us to the booking counter to see what they could do for us. When we returned to the counter (the time showing on my sister’s Fitbit was 13:24), we were told we had missed our flight and it was taking off. My sister showed the associate her Fitbit time of 13:32 and stated “This plane should still be on the ground.” The associate at the gate stated that the flight departure time had been moved up 3 minutes. I assured my sister to not worry that they were trying to help. The agent was trying to locate our reservations and when she realized we had booked a travel package, she informed us she could not help us other than to book tickets on the next day’s flight for $1500 per ticket and that we needed to contact our agent. She also informed us that her colleague had called our names before closing the door. I don’t speak French, but I do recognize my name and would have heard it if it had been announced. After this information, my sister again showed her the time on the Fitbit, which was 13:37, and said “This plane should still be on the ground!” I assured her we could not afford $3000 for one way tickets home. I asked if there was anything else British Airways / Openskies could do to make this right. She said, “No, you’ll have to contact your agent.” She was not interested in offering help once she realized we had not booked directly through British Airways. I am not sure what happened to make flight BA 8003 on January 19 depart early, but it wreaked havoc on our vacation, not to mention our wallets! The real question it left with me, however, is how the airlines could have announced our names, pulled our luggage from the plane and still managed to depart so early. The airlines did respond but did not address many of the question that were raised with them. Customer Relations, essentially, stated we are sorry for your experience.

### "will not be traveling Openskies again"
Paris ORY to New York JFK with Openskies. I utilized my American Airlines frequent flyer miles and I will not waste them on this airline again. The seat configuration was so bizarre. I had a window seat and I had to climb over the seat next to me to get into the aisle, as it was configured in the opposite direction from mine. One expects business class to have a seat that lies down flat, after all, that's why I chose to fly this class on a flight over the Atlantic. It was not in the least bit comfortable and I can't imagine who thought it would be. Going forward, I will not be traveling Openskies again.

### "warn you against OpenSkies"
OpenSkies advertise things that they don't deliver. I flew last August from Paris Orly to Newark on a Boeing 757 on OpenSkies in their Premium Eco class and everything was as described (except for the meal, which was just a regular eco meal chicken-pasta, not at all what they promise). On the way back, two weeks later, the plane was different and the seats were just plain economy seats with a little bit more of leg room, but nothing like what they advertise on their website. The movies were still the same (on an old iPad with nowhere to put it), the food also. All the passengers were complaining (after all, we had paid twice as much as in the regular eco class), to no effect of course. I wrote to BA's customer service several times when I got home and never got an answer. So I strongly warn you against OpenSkies and their deceptive advertising. It is clear that BA does not care about their customers. Choose another airline.

### "flight yesterday was cancelled again"
Flew Openskies from Paris Orly to Newark. I have flown this airline and route maybe twice a year or so for the past ten years, and in recent years the frequency of cancellations of my flight out of Orly for supposedly "mechanical failures" has risen to unbelievable proportions. My flight yesterday was cancelled again. I do travel regularly, often with BA, and I have never experienced such a high rate of flight cancellations on any other route.

### "things seem to be falling apart"
Paris Orly to Newark. I used to be a fan, but things seem to be falling apart. On April 2, 2016, we were called to board the plane, and at that moment, we were given the news the flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues. The information we received was chaotic. The female gate agent did not use the PA system and the message was in only one language. People could not hear details which raised the anxiety level within the group. We were led throughout the airport to clear customs, and pick up our checked luggage. We were finally sent to another counter on the other side of the terminal to deal with hotel and voucher procedures. Many followed blindly. We were told countless times to check our email to receive rebooking information from BA. It never arrived. I finally was able to get the gate agent to listen to me when I told her I called BA and they claimed the flight wasn't cancelled, thus the reason why none of us received a rebooking email. The gate agent was unaware that BA was oblivious. The BA agent on the phone told me that our flight was not cancelled. When I explained I cleared customs and currently have my checked in luggage returned and in my hands, she told me she couldn't help me because their screens did not show a cancellation. This was told to me after almost an hour had passed after we heard about the cancellation. Surreal. We were lucky. We were 2 out of 7 allowed to make the 13:40 flight out the next day. All of those folks booked for the same time the day following - cancelled again. I can't even imagine suffering a cancellation two times in a row. Unfortunately, this seems to be happening more than it should. There doesn't seem to be much support going out to this airline and it's unfortunate. In addition to this event, the seats in biz bed and premium economy are very worn and in some cases, the seats are not properly maintained and do not work. It's sad because this airline has such potential. I felt bad for the gate agents who attempted to handle the situation as best as they could. The gentleman (gate agent) was calm, cool and helpful, but it was clear they were all winging it with no support. We can no longer fly Openskies. We can't afford to gamble on when we might reach our destinations. I should also note they cancelled our original flight details on the return and moved us to the later flight about 2 months after booking. This has happened to us before. Had we been allowed to keep our original arrangement, we would have made it home instead of dealing with this.

### "the seat is terrible"
I was so looking forward to this Openskies flight from Paris Orly to New York, it sounded sexy on paper. Sorry to say, I was disappointed. The seat is terrible! It has absolutely no storage space so you don’t know where to put your items. Your glass of wine, your water bottle are put on this flimsy little stand which I kept knocking. I had my laptop on the ground, for there was no where else to put it, and I was always scared I was going to knock my wine and spill it all over the laptop. Plus this BA forward - backward seating, personally, I find very annoying. The person by the window has to step over your foot rest in order to get to the aisle. Very odd. The seats are old, narrow and rundown. And the Boeing 757-200 is even older! When is the last time you saw the console for lights, air and flight attendants on the ceiling above you? Instead of a built-in IFE you get an iPad, which is not necessarily a bad idea, however, there were maybe only 20 movies to watch. The one redeeming factor was the food and wine. The wine was superb and the food was very good as well. Unfortunately, will not be choosing Openskies anytime soon. It is an outdated and very unsexy product,

### "Horrible experience"
Paris Orly to New York JFK with Openskies. Requested seat 4J after waiting for the 24 hours check in period. I was trying to avoid being seated next to the toilet. Upon getting to the airport everything look good and received my boarding ticket with the proper seat. Then at the gate they decided to change my flight to the only other seat available next to the toilet as they explained that my seat was given to a crew member. As you can imagine, I was not happy and everything from there was downhill. Airplane is dated so the seat was uncomfortable and did not recline to a bed as expected. Food was barely edible and the service was nonexistent. Horrible experience on an airline that I was looking forward to flying with as this was my first flight with them. Never again.

### "declining quality of service"
Openskies used to be a great option from New York JFK to Paris Orly. But aging planes, crummy and continuously declining quality of service and food doesn't make it a worthwhile option anymore. You used to be treated like a human, but now it's just a bigger seat. There are better options out there. I guess this was an expected outcome once the big British Airways took over.

### Openskies customer review
What a disappointment! When we first flew OpenSkies in 2010 from Newark to Paris it was wonderful the lounge was beautiful and exclusive the seating on the flight was spacious and comfortable they offered us champagne etc. All this in the cheapest seats on the plane. This time the cheapest seats on the plane felt like the cheapest seats on any plane. This flight was from JFK to Orly. First we were unceremoniously dismissed at the entry to the lounge the employee told us we were "allowed" to wait at the gate with everybody else - in a very snarky tone. Fine. Then the seats on the plane were the same as seats on any flight 3 across uncomfortable recline position one of our seats kept flopping backwards. Food was standard airline fare. The plane didn't even have the overhead air circulation controls it was stifling for the entire flight! No individual seat-back entertainment available but they hand you an ipad. What nonsense - I have never seen a skimpier selection of inflight entertainment. Literally just a few TV shows a few movies very little audio a couple of games. With the return flight we didn't even bother accepting the ipad (neither did many other passengers I noticed). I know this may come across as whiny but when you look at the website and what the airline promises believe me they fall FAR short of their promises. The good news? The flight was empty both ways (no surprise there) and we arrived on time. Flight staff was no better or worse than any flight staff. Totally a disappointing experience given what they promise. Adjust your expectations downward.

### Openskies customer review
Flew September 17 2014 JFK to Orly. We left 10 minutes early and arrived almost an hour early. We flew premium economy and it was great. The flight crew were kind and attentive. Our return flight was cancelled several days prior to departure and that's when it went from great to not so. We were provided alternate flights but it was terrible having to connect in Heathrow and only have 40 minutes to get through customs and security it was a sprint to make our flight to JFK. In the end I would say we had a positive experience and would recommend Open Skies.

### Openskies customer review
BA flight 8005 from Orly to JFK. 9/15/2014. Planes are old and shabby and not enough restrooms. Seat was broken and did not recline at all - cabin crew unapologetic and said it happens all the time (unacceptable). Disorganized at Orly check-in and security. British Airways needs to get their act together with this product. I do not recommend.

### Openskies customer review
Worth the effort to go to NYC via Paris. The Orly lounge was comfortable but the one in Newark on the return flight was excellent. The staff and good quality were what did it for me. Attentive from check-in all the way through and really open and friendly in their approach. The food though spectacular. Fruit was fresh and just the right temperature. Seats were comfortable and complimentary iPads were a nice touch. The content too was up to date so I managed to get in a couple of films I didn't get to see in the cinema. It's a quick and comfortable journey and I didn't feel as rushed or herded like I have on other larger airlines.

### Openskies customer review
I recently flew Paris to New York return in their biz bed cabin. I was impressed. The fully lie flat bed was comfortable and the food served was possibly the best airline food I've been served crossing the Atlantic. I really liked their small touches like la duree macaroons and iPad based entertainment systems. I would say OpenSkies are my new favourite transatlantic airline. I also bagged a great deal on my flight so it was a win win scenario for me. I was also impressed with the efficiency of ORY airport.

### Openskies customer review
I had booked flights last year for a late June to early July 2013 New York to Paris trip. On the outbound to Paris the flight was delayed 2 hours mechanical problems poor communication by Open Skies staff to customers. The return flight to New York was a disaster. The flight was canceled their Paris staff were clearly overwhelmed and seemed not to know what to do and their communication skills in English were lacking. Finally after insisting they gave me a hotel and meal voucher for an Airport Hotel at Orly and put me on a flight the next day on an Air France plane back to NYC from CDG. Please note my hotel was at Orly! A considerable distance from Orly to CDG. To make a long story short I did not manage to get on an Air France flight until 4pm later that day. I had arrived at Orly the pervious day at 2pm. Would I ever fly this airline again. No. British Airways has their work cut out for them.

### Openskies customer review
JFK-ORY on B757-200. We flew in Prem Plus which is a definite premium economy upgrade rather than business downgrade but a sizeable step up from the Economy seats which looked very tight indeed. We secured 6D and 6F which were the bulkhead seats wider than BA's new WTP seats and had features like lumbar support a decent headrest and footrest and good recline - very comfortable although my headrest broke two hours in so I had to fashion one from the pillow. I would recommend exit row seats in row 7 as these have excellent leg room and a bolster cushion for your foot which looked very comfortable though these seem very difficult to book in advance without silver or gold status. Row 6 was good as no one was reclining into your space but if you're over 6 foot 2 the bulkhead could actually be a hindrance. The promised glass of bubbles on boarding never materialised (or at any point during the flight) and I was disappointed with the meals which were rather plain - chicken curry or pasta with vegetables - hardly inspiring and a bag with an apple muffin and orange juice for breakfast. The flight attendants however were pleasant and attentive throughout and a credit to the airline. The plane really is showing its age and it was extremely noticeable in the general wear and tear faded windows and the presence of ashtrays at the back of the plane. There was quite a bit of turbulence coming back in the jet stream and you really felt every little bump on this aging machine - I would say it's time for a fleet update. I didn't use the inflight entertainment (personal iPad) much but was disappointed to see it only had 25% charge so I doubt it would have worked for the flight duration anyway. That said it did have the same decent selection of films as the BA flight we flew out on plus some additional French films which was a nice touch. Arrival in Orly was quick and easy and we spent time in the Iberia codeshare lounge before connecting to LHR. The lounge was quiet and had a reasonable selection of drinks but that's where the benefits end. The lounge is quite a trek as others have noted and the food selection consisted of some plain crisps and plain crackers during the nearly 3 hours we were there and nothing else was offered. There are no toilets in the lounge one has to go out although they are close by and the promised escort to the plane didn't materialise despite the fact that I was on crutches. I requested wheelchair support and they were unable to provide this. If you have elite status I would certainly recommend using an alternative lounge. All in all Openskies does have its benefits with fewer passengers and a nice wide comfortable leather seat in Prem Plus. That said experiencing it once was enough for me personally and I'll be sticking with BA's new WTP product in future and flying UK - USA direct.

### Openskies customer review
Excellent value for money. Even though the plane was quite old the flight was very smooth. The old seats were very comfortable. I slept all flight long from NY to Paris. The food is good enough and the service on board from Paris to NY was great. At this price range it's a very good solution for a comfortable flight to NY or Paris. I will definitely use OpenSkies again.

### Openskies customer review
Value for money this was one of the best airline experiences I've had. Check in on both sides was fine. The premium plus with an equivalent fair to most airlines economy comfort was a far better value. Definitely more room and more comfortable seating than comparable airlines offerings. While their fleet of 757's are not new and not glamorous it was better than most international business class of 5 to 10 years ago. Considering you only pay a couple of hundred dollars more then a regular coach (sardine) class and $2-$3000 less in business class it is hard to beat this airline. Also the fact that fly to Orly as opposed to Charles de Gaulle makes transportation into the center of Paris much more economic.

### Openskies customer review
Planes are very old and seats in Premium economy are almost all broken. Paris to NY flight was okay but return flight to Paris was terrible. The meal was served very late and very poor dry and burnt pasta or dry and burnt curry chicken with rice. Breakfast was a paper bag with an orange juice bottle a small croissant and an apple. Staff aboard back to Paris with no care compared to flight to NY where staff were nice.

### Openskies customer review
Premium Plus direct from Newark to Paris r/t. Not only was the customer service horrible they didn't have my seat after I booked it 6 months ahead. The plane we took was run down old not fresh nor charming with poor lighting etc. Bathrooms were dirty. The food was poor. The attendants barely offered even water during the flight. That's if you could find them. The lounge is no longer available unless you're a silver/gold member. It used to be available to all premium plus seats and first class.

### Openskies customer review
Since British Airways assumed operations for Open Skies (previously a start up called L'Avion) the service has really deteriorated. While wholly owned by BA the staff seem not to co-operate and the Newark/NY (EWR) to Paris/Orly (ORY) route has become the most likely to be cancelled with no notice. We were scheduled (family of five) to depart Orly on July 9. Received no phone call and even registered online the night before. When we arrived at the airport at 8.30 for the 10.45am flight we were told it was cancelled. We waited 6+ hours in the airport not offered the lounge not offered food. Finally an angry employee ticketed us in Economy (we were Prem Plus customers) and grudgingly gave us vouchers for meals and a stay at the Ibis Orly Airport Hotel. They ticketed us at 5pm for a flight to JFK the following day. We will not fly this airline again.

### Openskies customer review
EWR-ORY-EWR. Increasingly being branded as BA and not Openskies. The Openskies Prem Plus service is far far superior to the similar BA Premium Economy offering. Seat comfort very retro in old 1980 style business class seats really found them very comfortable. Small aircraft the 757 allows for delightfully attentive service from charming warm French Cabin Crew. Meals above expectations and really nice wines. Loved the I-Pads for entertainment. Orly West great small no long walks check-in easy and smooth baggage delivery fast an efficient. Best of all fast and relatively inexpensive cab rides to/from Paris. Let us hope that with the increasing merge of a delightful boutique brand into the monolithic BA that some of the BA negative attitudes towards passengers do not infect the charming Openskies boutique brand. Will continue to take Openskies in the meantime if only BA would emulate Openskies for its Premium Economy product I would consider flying them once again.

### Openskies customer review
Orly to Newark and back. Friendly service and very comfortable flight. Generous food offering and reasonably selection of Entertainment on ipads. New BA lounge at Newark is a great addition - plenty of space and excellent pre dinner option when flying Business. Lounge in Paris is unfortunately too far away from the Openskies gates to make it worth the visit.

### Openskies customer review
We have twice now flown the Newark / Orly route on Open Skies-- originally in April 2012 then again in December. The first time the flight was described as Biz Seat and the entire airplane was configured with their biz seats. These are good but not great seats adequately sized for the most part but just not quite long enough for a 6 ft individual and 100% manual recline and leg rests. The portable a/v systems were in many ways superior to the typical major carrier central a/v systems but on both outbound and inbound legs the batteries were not adequately charged and it ran out before arrival. No backup so I was out of luck. The all biz seat arrangement meant fast loading fast unloading and relatively rapid bag delivery. Food and wine were not bad but nothing special. On time for the most part. Good enough to do it again in December. By December the offering had morphed a bit. Same seats but now the plane was a 757 and was configured as 'biz bed - business class' Prem Plus premium economy (the prior Biz Seat) config and regular (6 across) economy. The seats were the same. The food/wine in Prem Plus were strictly economy sub mediocre and the baggage delivery horrible at ORY. The a/v systems had been upgraded to new ipads which worked well but still needed more management of battery charging. The prior rapid boarding was lost with the larger plane and 3 class seating. Bottom line at 1250 per person r/t it's a lot more comfortable than economy but you no longer get a biz lounge invitation and the food was really bottom of the barrel. I'd do it again because the itinerary is perfect for my needs but don't do it if you're expecting business class at economy pricing.

### Openskies customer review
Flew June 29 2012 in new ECO service. 3x3 for last 11 rows of plane. This would be difficult travel for strangers in same row. Very much domestic type economy seats. Unusual policies also. Asked if I could buy an upgrade and they said I could have but it would have been only at the ticket counter. At the ticket counter I was told to ask at the gate. Difficult to get checked in with contract service handling flight. The gate area was chaotic and that is being generous. Had to ask about lounge pass which as Sapphire One World they were to recognize. They gave it and told me to use priority security lines but the boarding pass and code would not work as it needed to be generated at time of boarding pass. From the time I booked the flight to when we took it they instituted ECO class. When booked I thought I was coming back through EWR and would be worth the trouble because I would have economy plus. 2 weeks before the scheduled flight they changed config to add 3rd class of service. I would not do that again. We were fortunate to have 3 seats for 2 of us but had the class been full it would have been a nightmare for 8 hours. Nice cabin crew. Lousy food. Ipads for entertainment were a plus.

### Openskies customer review
Travelling Paris-Newark in October and I fear I'm about to be very disappointed (a pity because I've flown this route with OpenSkies in the past and had good service). A phone call today informed me that my flight has been cancelled with three options available: leave the previous day (impossible as connecting flights are built around this one) fly BA through London (non-direct flight that adds 3.5 hours to an already long trip; I chose OS to avoid this sort of thing) or refund. The customer service agent was courteous but had no explanation other than "operational issues" (3 months out?). My answers to the other rating questions in this review would be "it depends" (on the outcome of the current situation) but that option is not available.

### Openskies customer review
Flew OpenSkies in a Biz Seat from EWR to ORY and back. Comfortable seats on time departure early arrival decent food and very nice crew. Having only a small number of people on the aircraft and using ORY instead of CDG make a world of difference. This really is one of the most pleasant ways to fly.

### Openskies customer review
Open Skies makes the waiting and boarding process very relaxed. In Newark we were treated to the British Airways Lounge as we were flying BizBed to Paris. Security was even easier with all the little perks you get by flying this "boutique" airline. The bed was okay but the configuration of the BizBed cabin was atrocious. Once everyone reclines their bed you can not get out if you in the window seat. Each bed unfolds to the edge of the seat in front and in back of them. Coming home we were in the BizSeat cabin. Orly Airport was excellent. Security was set up so you bypass the masses and enter through a private line. The lounge was quite comfortable and extremely relaxing. For the comparative price to business class/first class on other airlines this is a great bargain.

Check-in is smooth the seats very comfortable and I find Newark in the US and Orly in Paris both more reasonable options than JFK and Charles De Gaulle for city access. I am not a big consumer of inflight entertainment but they gave out iPads that seemed to have a large range of movies and TV and even some games. The food is pretty horrible but does anyone really expect great cuisine on a plane? We flew BizBed over and it was a treat to actually recline all the way and arrive semi-rested as opposed to uncomfortable United and Delta Business seats on previous flights. I would definitely fly them again and hope that they can stay in business.

On our outbound flight to Paris my seat did not work properly. The light panels for reading did not work on our side of the plane nor did my hand-held remote for the movie. Attendants were polite but unapologetic. On our return flight to DC we were delayed at the airport for over 3 hours because of a strike situation and our flight sent to Newark. Again no apologies. Save your money and take a different airline!

Dulles-Orly return. Checked in online used American Airlines Admirals Club boarded on time and surprised at condition of aircraft and seats. Flight attendants were helpful and during a delay served additional beverages - meal was good. Our return flight was no different. ICare Lounge was spacious with food and beverages to choose from. The main meal on the return was lovely. Audio Visual system it may not have been state of the art but worked well with much to view.

The actual flying and airport experience is that of an average Economy Plus with access to mediocre airport lounges. Onboard the seats are a little better than economy plus much less good than business class. No bells and whistles poor entertainment. Food ok wine quite nice no hard liquor. What kills the Open Skies experience is their sales and reservations practices and procedures. They reschedule and cancel without notification and on minimal notice. If you need to change it's a nightmare. The "archive" or "purge" your records which then have to be "researched" a lengthy and extraordinarily aggravating experience. We cancelled a trip for last week and they have twice either archived or purged our records so that once again they are not able to rebook our travel til further "research". This has gone on for 10 days and is beginning to feel like an overt attempt to convert our monies. We would only fly this airline if were for a last minute booking and only if they were significantly less expensive than Air France Premium Economy. Having to deal with Open Skies on this rescheduling has been the most difficult experience of our highly traveled lives.

Extremely thoughtful and helpful service. Dulles-Orly roundtrip we traveled with a dog and on both check-ins the staff could not have been more helpful reassembling the cage for us providing water for the animal assisting us personally through security. The same attentive help was provided with our luggage which had been unloaded from the belt and assembled in one location when completed immigration procedures. During the flight we found the overall attention to details surprising food was good the selection of wine refreshing the absence of duty free sales commercial pitches and interruptions by the captain most welcome. Overall a pleasant experience further enhanced by the small number of passenger which made both departure and arrival a breeze compared to even preferential treatment when you are part of a crowd 500+ strong.

ORY to EWR. Plane departed on time  cabin was clean and crew in our zone friendly and efficient. No more food choice. All the dishes on a single tray like in Economy Class. Food was cold and main course choice not available and being seated in row 8 this is not understandable. Inflight Entertainment system was as usual not working replaced 3 times without luck. Landed in EWR on time and luggage delivered quickly.

### Openskies customer review
757-200 all Business Class from ORY-EWR return. Check-in at both airports and onboard service slow food choices limited and poor quality. Cabin attendants are 'correct' but unsmiling. DVD players handed out well over an hour after take-off and collected 40 mins before landing. Cheaper than regular C class on other carriers but one might as well go Economy - the experience is not much different.

### Openskies customer review
IAD to Orly was diverted to Newark without explanation. Passengers special meal requests were not honoured and our flight arrived more than 3 hrs late. Orly is an unpleasant environment the ticket areas are not even staffed at all times by OpenSkies. Customer service is lacking. The only thing it can honestly sell is extra legroom between seats in the Business Seat area on old reconfigured planes. This is not a business class experience.

### Openskies customer review
Paris to Newark. Roomy seats that recline allowing you to get a comfortable rest. Lots of space between rows. You can have up to 3 pieces of luggage up to 23 kg. However worn out seats and old noisy plane. Flight attendants weren't very attentive. There was no duty free on board. They give you an old handheld screen with a limited choice of films. The meal took a very long time with a 1 hour wait between dishes. Food was average. Do not book the aisle seat on the first row of Business seats as there is less leg room because of the emergency exit door.

### Openskies customer review
I flew roundtrip from Newark to Paris and was very pleased with the flight. Quick and easy check in the lounge in Newark is pretty well hidden but was fine once there. Very easy clearing security in both airports. I cleared customs in both cities within about 30mins and was on my way. More importantly for me was the extra room- which was what I paid the extra money for. You could tell the plane was old but the service was good and the meal we had was certainly well above normal Economy fare. Not being a business traveler I can't really comment about comparisons but the price was definitely worth it for my comfort.

### Openskies customer review
I am extremely disappointed by the service we got. I had booked an Orly-Dulles flight which got cancelled due to a gas leak. We got told that we would be on the next day flight or at worse on an extra flight they were adding on their schedule. We were then sent to a hotel and told they would contact us either later in the evening or morning. The following day with still no news from OpenSkies some of us went directly to the airport to find out what was going on. We were received very rudely by OpenSkies who actually tried their best to make us cancel our ticket. The supposed extra flight actually never existed and they were still trying to sell tickets for the DC flight of the day for EUR 6000 while we were told to wait. In the end I had to go through British Airways in the other terminal of Orly airport who called OpenSkies and told them to stop selling tickets for the NY flight and book us instead. We then got taken in charge directly by BA at Newark who got us tickets to DC in the evening. OpenSkies does not care about their customers only about turning max profit I am very disappointed especially for a BA brand.

Newark-Orly return. For travellers who don't usually fly Business class this was a treat. Yes seats and interior of plane were a bit worn. Service and food was great Best of all you could stretch out and be comfortable during the flight. I wish they flew more places. We would use them again.

### Openskies customer review
Newark-Paris return. The planes are very old and seats and hand held A/V are 1970's restrooms very worn etc. This is not a premium Business Class service that one is used to on major carriers. Having said that it is a great value for your travel dollar - 78 seats on a 757 very acceptable lounges with free drinks and snacks at both Newark and Orly plenty of room between seat rows etc. It is really more of a Premium Economy service on old equipment with slightly upgraded economy class meals in flight but at a price of under $2000 versus a Business Class ticket to Europe on a major carrier of $5000+ it does represent a good value for a relatively short flight (7 hrs).

### Openskies customer review
My wife and I flew to Paris at the end of April experience was great and we got lucky and the flights there and back were only about one-third full. The seats are older business class seats and on the way over I noticed that one of our seats wouldn't recline - we switched because the flight was mostly empty. Service great and flight attendants were very professional and courteous. Flying business class means you get to skip the security lines and immigration lines. The lounge (British Airways) while waiting means you can connect to wifi and have a drink/snack. So nothing special about the plane itself other than you get a big seat.

### Openskies customer review
IAD-ORY return. Dulles lounge was satisfactory and Orly quite good. The crews on both legs were very attentive and pleasant. Food and drinks very good by airline standards. I like Orly as an arriving destination to Paris and connecting to other cities in Europe finding it more convenient and less crowded than other major airports. We took flat beds from IAD to ORY and biz seats back and were satisfied with the choice. From a price perspective alone we feel this is an excellent choice and with the experiences on both legs and at the lounges are very pleased and will repeat.

### Openskies customer review
My first trip with OpenSkies was excellent. The lounge at Dulles is very nice the plane was spacious food and wine were good. The return was fine as well. My next trip the first leg went very smoothly but now as I approach the final part I am terribly frustrated and disappointed with OpenSkies. Unfortunately I had to book my return flight for this summer in November when my schedule was still a bit up in the air. About 3 weeks ago however I finalized my schedule and saw to my dismay that I would need to change my ticket by about two months. I was bracing myself for a ticket change fee - but was shocked to find out that in order to change my ticket (giving them months notice) I will need to pay $450 in addition to about $150 extra for increased gas prices - that's $600 extra for a flight change with months notice! I emailed and called and spoke with many people - all said that same thing - that's policy no way around it. Now I don't expect a big cooperation to just change their policy for me but I do expect some sort of help or at least a little sympathy when I pay thousands of dollars for a ticket. The lack of care or sympathy from those I spoke and emailed with astonished me! Not only did they not give me a break at all but they didn't even put out the effort to seem sorry for my circumstances. Perhaps most people who use this airline are wealthy but I am not. I used them this year as a special treat and now I am absolutely paying for it. As of today I can buy a round trip ticket with British Airways from Paris to NY for less than $600. And unless a miracle happens soon I'll be paying $600 just to switch the day of my flight. I think it is ridiculous that I have to pay such an extravagant fee to change a flight with months of notice!

### Openskies customer review
Open Skies cancelled my departure flight (booked 3 months in advance) without notifying me. I found out three days before departure when I tried to choose my seats on line. They only offered cancellation or a move of departure flight one day later (no options earlier). Changing the return flight was not possible. Very inconvenient very disappointing.

### Openskies customer review
ORY-EWR return. Lounge at ORY is pretty minimal with everyone crowded at one end to avoid the noise of the building work going on at the other end. The plane struck me as having seen better days; the fittings are a bit scuffed around the edges and several people including me had seats that either didn't recline or wouldn't stay upright! Luckily there were few people on the outbound flight and there were a multitude of alternative seats to choose from. IFE is terrible - handheld devices that keep crashing requiring the user to re-start whatever they're watching and presenting all sorts of logistical problems when the tray you've just set it up on is required for the meal. Take a laptop or similar to entertain yourself. Lounge in EWR is poor; wrong side of security and looks like a large waiting room. I jumped ship and headed for the BA Terraces lounge past security and right beside the Openskies departure gate. Overnight return flight was more populated but the almost lie-flat beds provided a good night's kip. Overall a nice sense of space and the FAs are attentive generous with their time and drinks and even though there's a Biz beds and Biz seats segregation going on you still feel as if you're enjoying something a little unknown and exclusive. Personally I wouldn't make the effort of travelling to Paris just to fly Openskies again - not without checking the difference between this and Premium Economy on BA first - but if you're there already it's worth a look.

### Openskies customer review
Nice Business class (old style) seats from Orly (more convenient than CDG) to IAD Washington. Good ICARE Salon at ORY. Plane was half empty and we arrived ahead of schedule.

### Openskies customer review
EWR-ORY return Biz seats. Better than expected. Isn't up to BA flat bed filet mignon and Terraces lounges but for $750 one way quite nice. Check-in swift and pleasant. EWR lounge comfy decent drinks and snacks. Seat reclined nicely and plenty of room for our average sized bodies. Plane clean and in good shape. Food better than decent - much better than any US Majors. Nice wines generously given. FAs pleasant and helpful. Amenity pack okay but who cares? Didn't bother with AVOD. Disembarking quick and easy. ORY convenient as we got car and headed south right away. Everything on return flight at least as good maybe somewhat better food and nicer lounge.

### Openskies customer review
Newark to Orly plane was old but relatively clean. My seat was broken and did not recline. The flight was sold out and I was forced to sit perfectly straight for the entire flight and I landed exhausted. They say 100% satisfaction but that is not true. Despite several calls and letters I was offered nothing for my discomfort. I would not fly with them again customer service was terrible the experience poor.

### Openskies customer review
EWR-ORY return. Flight out was very efficient and EWR lounge was uncrowded. Outgoing flight to Paris was served by French staff who were very attentive. This contrasted sharply with the flight back. Orly check in was disorganized testing a new system with passengers as guinea pigs - 45 min line for check in. This was followed by a dark overcrowded lounge with indifferent staff. When I inquired about wifi I was informed it hadn't worked in over a month and there were no expectations for future improvement. Orly lounge staff also failed to inform about a late change in gate assignment resulting in a delay in loading passengers. The American staff on return seemed indifferent and a bit dour. Flight time was good and inclined seats are still at a bargain price but it would be so much better with an upgrade in attitude and simple service onboard and in Orly lounge.

### Openskies customer review
If you're expecting an industry standard Business Class experience you're going to be disappointed. If you're looking for a cheap way to get from A to B with above Y class comfort this could be the airline for you. Facilities at EWR are very basic and have a very budget airline feel. It's cramped shared with Jet Airways and is surprisingly before security which with checkin time two hours prior makes it useless to have. I travelled Biz Bed EWR- ORY. The plane is old dirty in places and not at all what I was expecting from a BA brand airline. It's a hodge podge of branding. There are parts BA parts OpenSkies and parts L'Avion. Overhead storage is minimal as vast amounts is taken up by aircraft equipment. Seats which do go to a lie flat position are old stained and very narrow. I'm 5'11 and found it a challenge to get comfortable. The food is fine but I never have high expectations on a plane. Wines were of a good calibre. Flight attendants seem to work hard and service can be slow. It took over two hours before I was able to sleep which is why I paid extra for the bed. Once they've finished they're not seen again. Mix of French and American attendants though I only had the French crew in my area so can't say what the service was like in the rest of the aircraft. There is no amenity kit - socks and shades on the seat but they're not wrapped in plastic and the toothbrushes etc are handed out from a worn wicker basket. No privacy curtain meant heavy traffic from Biz Seat passengers who come up frequently to use the toilets thereby disturbing biz bed. Orly is a very old worn airport which is marginally easier to get into Paris from though all things being equal I'd rather fly into CDG with a legacy carrier who have got their act together. Nice try OpenSkies but not anywhere near the finesses of other airlines. This really is a budget low cost premium economy airline.

### Openskies customer review
The flights themselves were reasonable value especially for late booking but don't believe their promise that "in case of train or flight service disruption OpenSkies guarantees to book you on the next flight or train available. And offer you a hotel stay if necessary. When my TGV from Lyon had engine trouble and arrived too late for the flight to IAD OpenSkies staff at ORY rudely repudiated these "guarantees". I was refused a seat on the only other flight to EWR because I was a "no show" although the train had been arranged by the airline itself my "one and only" contact. I was told that if I wanted to buy another ticket I'd have to do so by phone since "we are not OpenSkies we are acting for OpenSkies. I finally got through to a supervisor in Paris and was "permitted" to board the Newark flight but the only guarantee I got was that OpenSkies would take no responsibility for getting me back to Washington.

### Openskies customer review
I have flown Open Skies from Newark EWR to Paris Orly 3 times. The first year British Airways took over for L'Avion was not so great but they have improved. You can't beat the price for a business class ticket - $1500 round trip is a bargain. First class lounges in both Orly and Newark. Diplomat first class custom lines at the airport. Excellent Billecart Salmon champagne and great food and wines on the last 2 flights. The French plane still has that awful hand held entertainment system but we got the British plane 757 going back to the US which has a metal arm to the hold the screen. Only 90 passengers on the plane big roomy seats and very nice bilingual flight attendants. The Biz Beds are also nice however since I don't sleep on the plane it's not worth the extra money for me.

### Openskies customer review
Roundtrip Newark to Paris Orly in the BizSeat category. The service product and food were all excellent. The flight attendants were friendly young and gave excellent service. The food & drinks were great and plenty of each. The seats were comfortable great legroom (exit row seat on the way to Paris) - could've been a bit wider in the seat though. The entertainment system was good. A bunch of new movies TV shows games & music (all which could be a bit more updated). The flights were on time and took no time to claim my checked luggage. I wish they still flew to Amsterdam as that was my final destination.

### Openskies customer review
IAD-ORY in biz seat. 2 hours delay due to engine problem at ORLY but crew and ground staff managed to change aircraft. Compared to biz bed offer you don't get a lie flat seat and food not as sophisticated. But what you get is the premium feel nice wide and 140 degree leather seats which are fine even for night flight smooth boarding and of course the nice atmosphere of a small cabin. Service was good. My IFE screen had to be changed and plug was not functioning. Equipment in these old B757 do show their age. Orly is a relatively small airport and with the limited number of passengers I was out 15 minutes only after disembarking. Another feature of openskies is the possibility to book the return flight the other class but overall I found the seat cabin to be more competitive. Bizz seat is not a premium economy product but business light.

### Openskies customer review
Biz seat is fine for the price service is good staff very attentive. The only bad point is the poor quality of the IFE but with an IPOD and a good book you don't care! From Paris it was good catering. Biz bed is great for a night flight a duvet pillow and you can ask when you want to dine. Good flight on time.

### Openskies customer review
ORY-EWR first time using Open Skies. I didn't know about the airlines until I was told by my travel agent that it offers value for money. Was told that it was all business class but when I boarded it was obvious that my seat and the amenity kit given were inferior from those at the front of the aircraft. The food and service were OK and although the airline is operated by BA I think BA's business class service is better and the FAs are more attentive. But of course I suppose you have to pay premium for that.

### Openskies customer review
IAD-ORY return in BizSeat. I disagree with comments about the BizSeat being Premium Economy rather than Business Class. BizSeat is equivalent to the business class seats that airlines used to use on transatlantic seats prior to the introduction of flat beds in the last few years. The seat is very comfortable and uses old manual controls reclines to a 140 degree angle. The best thing about the layout of the 757 currently used on the Dulles route is that there are just 40 seats in the BizSeat cabin and 24 in the BizBed cabin meaning 64 passengers. BA Lounge at Dulles is great while the Salon Icare lounge at Orly is nothing to write home about. Service on the flight to ORY was poor especially considering that there were only 25 passengers on board and 5 flight attendants. Service on the return from ORY with a full plane was much better. The one downfall certainly in the BizSeat cabin is the food and beverage service. While there are some great wines available liquor selection is very limited. The main meals are nouvelle cuisine so while tasty are not very filling. I was shocked that OpenSkies don't provide a menu card to preview meal options. The breakfast on the outbound and snack on the return flight were below the standard I've seen in any transatlantic economy cabin. Passing through the BizBed cabin it looks like a very poor product compared with parent company BA's Club World and not worth the money. I'd strongly recommend OpenSkies BizSeat for anybody looking for a very affordable halfway point between Premium Economy and a lie-flat bed but the small number of people on board makes the biggest difference.

### Openskies customer review
IAD-ORY return in business (premium economy?) seats. The seats are comfortable enough but not at the level of major carriers. Manual controls don't always work very well but the seat pitch is very decent. Fold-out trays show the effects of age - none were flat all sagged in the middle. Food service - no menu paper tablecloth but wine was quite good. Service is professional but not terribly attentive. Meal on return from Paris was pretty awful though. On the plus side the price is great (got a 2-for-1 deal on this trip) - Orly Airport is old but convenient.

### Openskies customer review
ORY-IAD. First time on OpenSkies. Good value business class with flat bed and business experience (food amenities lounge etc) but in a small aircraft. This means cabin with more privacy and rapid boarding / luggage delivery. Since OpenSkiesis British Airways subsidiary you can rely on British Airways ground facilities and shared frequent flyer programme. The B757 plane is retrofitted with former BA business seats - somewhat old but acceptable entertainment system. More privacy than Air France. Food was good on this flight and by far better than British Airways. Crew ok and more interaction in such cabin. Operating from Orly also an advantage - connecting from other countries is pretty smooth with orly connected to RER through main Paris railway stations.
