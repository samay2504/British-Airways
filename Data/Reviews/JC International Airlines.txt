### "avoid this company at all costs"
Bangkok to Sihanouk . Ten days out from travel date the airline cancelled outward and return travel tickets. This cancellation occurred during peak holiday season. My only alternative was to then book on another airline at full price during the busiest time of year. Costing me $100's of dollars more and changing my travel days, i rang the airline and asked when i would get a refund, i was told in approximately one month, I asked for it immediately as i need it to pay for my new flights and was told that they are very busy at the moment because its peak season and there is nothing further they can do. Left stranded in a foreign by an airline that has poor customer support and inadequate systems and resources to ensure customers can travel reliably. My strongest advice is to avoid this company at all costs.
