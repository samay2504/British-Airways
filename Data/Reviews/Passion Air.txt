### "no air conditioning while boarding"
Not Verified | I will not recommend PASSION AIR to anyone. They refuse to turn on the air conditioning in the plane while boarding. Passengers where sweating profusely. I personally felt like I was suffocating considering the I live in the UK. Infact this is health and safety issue.

### "not fit to serve the demand of passengers"
Not Verified | This airline is not fit to serve the demand of flying passengers who are in need of a timely, comfortable option to suit their travel itineraries. I experienced a 2 hr 20 minute delay on my flight with PassionAir from Accra to Kumasi in the evening. PassionAir needs to explain to me how exactly on their end they see if fit to push a 40 min flight back almost 2 and a half hours. Let’s think about this. Are they running their planes on routes to and from Ghana domestic airports behind the demand of their traveling customers? I’m writing this review in hopes of encouraging PassionAir to remove its “trotro” service mindset and begin to run an airline that brings glory to Ghana.

### "They are extremely unprofessional"
Not Verified |  They are extremely unprofessional. If you pay for a ticket for your flight to leave at a certain time, and you tell me there were changes and certain people got an email and others didn't that's a lie. It went from some people got a phone call to emails, then all of a sudden most people knew it would be departing later. How? Because most ppl knew about your reputation about being unprofessional. Now an hour later they announcing the plane is delayed due to weather yet other flights at the airport are flying. It's just unprofessional. They are operating on CPT for flights. Make it make sense. We are paying for a service the least you can do is be professional. We are traveling with children you don't know how long it took us to get here etc.

### "seats had no reclining function"
I flew on OP178 from Accra to Tamale in the north of Ghana and back two days later. The plane is over 15 years old. The outside appearance looked good, the cabin impression was ok but maybe a bit tired. The impression was that the cabin reflects the age of the plane. Surprisingly there was no shutter for the windows. The seats had no reclining function. The flight OP178 was supposed to leave ACC at 15:50, boarding at 15:10, gate 4 domestic Terminal. The video screen showed outdated information of OP146, a flight which was supposed to leave ACC for Kumasi at 10:30 (apparently delayed). There was no info of OP178 visible (also no audio announcements). Only audio announcements of landed flights. Boarding started at 15:45 without any prior info. Bus transfer to plane from gate. In Bus information about boarding procedure (rows 1-10 front door). As rear door remained closed, all passengers boarded via the front door. The flight took off with about 30min delay due to late arrival of the incoming plane (according to captain). Service on board was ok, every passenger received a small bottle of water, a fruit juice and a little snack (some pastry with meat, I didn't taste it). Flight back from TML left on time, boarding procedure is a bit easier in TML as there is only one gate and a small waiting area. No screens but I really didn't feel the need for it. OP179 arrived 10min ahead of schedule in ACC. Service was very much the same but this time with the choice of a sandwich (chicken) or a small danish. Again I didn't taste either one. Luggage delivery in TML took surprisingly long, in ACC it was a short wait.
