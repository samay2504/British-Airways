### "3 drastic schedule changes"
Aruba to Bonaire via Curacao. Appalling. 3 drastic schedule changes before departure. Then i was notified 12 hours before departure that the flight was cancelled. Living in europe i unfortunately wasn't aware of this airlines poor performance. Do not book with them. Instead book Aruba or divi. They cancelled all their flights the week i was travelling but were still selling tickets for them. Despicable. No response by email or phone for me to get a refund.

### "flight had been canceled"
I booked a round trip flight for me and my wife from Aruba to Curacao leaving on 11/16/2018 and returning on 11/21/2018. I received an email from them yesterday stating that the return flight had been canceled and they booked me on a flight almost 7 hours later. This would make me miss my connection to United cost me 300.00 per person to change the flight to a flight the following day and cost me an overnight stay in Aruba. Around 900.00 total. I called their customer service line and they told me that I could get a full refund by emailing [email protected]. I sent the email and they replied and said they could not refund the ticket cost even though this violates article 10.2 of the carriage agreement. After several emails back and forth I contacted my credit card company, provided them all the emails and they agreed to reverse the charge. They also told me there have been numerous complaints to Visa and MasterCard about this company. I also researched it a bit and the company is in bankruptcy and only has 3 planes in their entire fleet. If you have already been screwed by this company just file a claim with your credit card provider.

### "third was catastrophic"
Bonaire to Curacao. 3 flights made with this airline in 2 weeks. The first flight left early, the second on time: nothing to say - the third was catastrophic: 2 days before our flight, schedule change from 10.30am to 7.45am, forcing us to arrange for check out and transfer to the airport. The day before, new mail confirmation of this change of schedule and registration on the flight by internet. In the night before our flight, when we had to leave our villa at 5.00am, new mail informing us that our flight was canceled again and postponed at the end of the day, which would have made us miss our connection to Curaçao for Amsterdam. We arrived at 6.00am at the airport, however, and managed to convince them to put us on a Winair flight that allowed us to have our connection. What stress for our end of vacation! The check-in staff was incompetent. FR: 3 vols réalisés avec cette compagnie en 2 semaines. Le premier vol est parti en avance, le deuxième à l'heure: rien à dire. Par contre, le troisième a été catastrophique: 2 jours avant notre vol, changement d'horaire, de 10.30am à 7.45am, nous obligeant à nous organiser pour le check out et le transfert à l'aéroport. La veille, nouveau mail de confirmation de ce changement d'horaire et enregistrement sur le vol par internet. Dans la nuit précédant notre vol, alors que nous devions partir de notre villa à 5.00am, nouveau mail nous informant que notre vol était de nouveau annulé et reporté en fin de journée, ce qui nous aurait fait manquer notre connexion à Curaçao pour Amsterdam. Nous nous sommes quand-même présentés à 6.00am à l'aéroport, et avons réussi à les convaincre de nous caser sur un vol Winair qui nous permettait d'avoir notre connexion. Que de stress pour notre fin de vacances! Le personnel à l'enregistrement était simplement incompétent. Compagnie vraiment à la dérive, entre son personnel, son organisation et l'ancienneté de ses avions.

### "change our flight by 2 hours"
Aruba to Bonaire via Curacao. We booked in April 2017 for a flight Feb 22 2018. By chance I decided to look at the flight schedule 2/14 and found it had change our flight by 2 hours so we would not make the connection. I got Insel to change us but given the late arrive into BON would not get our hotel to get us. So I tried to cancel only to find they sent me a clause: 9.2 CANCELLATION AND DELAYS 9.2.1 InselAir will take all necessary measures to avoid delay in carrying you and your baggage but times shown on timetables or elsewhere are not guaranteed and form no part of the agreement. Insel Air may at its own discretion, with or without notice and in order to prevent a flight cancellation, substitute alternate carriers or aircraft and if necessary may alter, add or omit stopping places shown on the ticket or itinerary. Schedules are subject to change without notice. InselAir is not responsible for or liable for failure to make connections or to operate any flight according to schedule or for a change to the schedule of any flight. Under no circumstances shall InselAir be liable for any special, incidental or consequential damages arising from the foregoing. I did not read the contract of carriage, no 1 does. Anyway no refund.

### "such bad performance"
Aruba to Bonaire via Curacao. I have never experienced such bad performance. Three of my four flights were updated twice before taking the first one, and all of them were delayed for no clear reason. I do not expect for an airline to be on time always, but Insel Air seems to find a way time and again to make passengers waste time at the airport waiting for their flight. If you fly between Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao, I suggest you prefer Aruba Airlines or Divi Divi Airlines.

### "Avoid if you can!"
Curacao to Aruba. Worst airline ever. For a change the airline left early. We did not get any notification at all and nothing was the matter when we checked in the night before. We were well in time at the airport, but no plane for us. Next available flight was only a day later, after much trouble we got on a flight 6 hours later! No apology or acknowledgement at all, service staff just shut up and looked the other way. No compensation offered for anything, even though it's their responsibility. Avoid if you can! !

### "fleet  got grounded"
❎ Unverified |  Insel Air finally got theirs and their fleet to South America got grounded by Civil Aviation. Unfortunately that was my ticket into South America. I had to buy another ticket with another airline and by then I missed all connecting flights in Rio and Buenos Aires. It cost me $4,000 to get to my final destination

### "Treated us like garbage"
Port of Spain to Willemstad. Please don't put your family through the pain, disappointment, sadness, stress and feeling like your nothing by flying with insel. My flight was due to leave Trinidad Thursday 5:20pm. After having three delays it showed new time as Friday 4:40am. We spoke to the Insel Air rep in Trinidad. She lied to us saying there's an Insel plane leaving trinidad and will be back for us 4:40am and to arrive at the airport 1:40 am. We arrived 1:30am only to see a sign saying check in is now at 6:20am flight delayed to 9:55am. We waited only to be told we can't board the flight so we'll have to wait for a space and just left us. The supervisor was the worst person. She made us feel like we were the wrong ones. Even yelling at us. Treated us like garbage. And our trip is now cancelled. Please don't book with this airline. It has been the worst experience of my life.

### "flight was cancelled three times"
Curaçao to Port of Spain with Insel Air. My flight was cancelled three times. Then they schedule the flight at 3am to avoid paying hotel. When you get there at 1am, it's closed with a notification that the flight is scheduled to 8am. When you come back at 5 AM, the flight is overbooked and they transfer you to a flight which again is scheduled at 3am the following day to avoid paying for hotel. The chance for departure - well, tomorrow will show..

### "never take this airline again"
Piarco to Curaçao with Insel Air. Appalling. After 9 hours of delay, we received not a single acknowledgement or apology for the delay. I have been in public restrooms cleaner than the plane that finally arrived. On the second leg of our flight, half our group was bumped from the flight for no good reason, in spite of having previously checked in. Again, no acknowledgement or apology. Same Fokker plane. I will never take this airline again. Better to pay more and find different schedules than use Insel Air again.

### "worst airline I have flown"
Bonaire to Curaçao. Insel Air is the worst airline I have ever flown. Not only are the planes old and dirty, but their flights are almost always delayed or cancelled - and worst of all, they refuse to take responsibility for these delays. I was flying from Bonaire to Curaçao when my flight got delayed by almost 2 hours. As a result, I missed my connection to fly me back to Europe. Insel Air refused to take responsibility and I had to buy a new ticket in order to get home with a two day delay. This ended up costing me more than 1000$! Definitely won't use Insel Air again!

### "pay the extra to avoid Insel"
❎ Unverified |  Bonaire to Curaçao. My family has been flying to Bonaire for years and there is always an issue with Insel. We usually try to avoid it but this year had no choice. The flights from Bonaire to Curaçao were delayed traveling there and back. On the way home they took stand by passengers from the previous delayed flight and took our confirmed tickets and switched them to stand by so we weren't able to get on the flight out of Curaçao to Aruba! Then had to spend the night in Aruba because we missed the connection flight home. They didn't pay for a hotel or for the $400 fee to switch our flights and we were traveling with our 1 year old and 4 year old! The supervisor told us we were out of luck and literally walked away from us. The staff is horrendous and also all the toilets in the bathroom wouldn't flush and the airport is disgusting. Please do yourself a favor and pay the extra money to avoid Insel. You will save yourself a nightmare. If I could give them a zero star I would.

### "my return flight is canceled"
I booked a round trip from Miami to Bonaire. At first my flight from Miami to Curaçao was canceled so I had to leave next day. Then my luggage didn't make it to Bonaire and I had do return to the airport next day to pick it up. Now my return flight from Bonaire to Curaçao is canceled, that means that I will miss my flight from Curaçao to Miami. So right now I am stuck at Bonaire airport, they gave me $7 voucher so I could get something to eat. What a joke!

### "avoid a travel nightmare"
I was due to fly from Bonaire to Miami on 1/28 connecting in Curacao at 10:20am with Insel Air. I had purchased Tickets with a different airlines to take me much later from Miami to Denver. Late on the night of 1/27 the airline emailed me to say that my morning flight was cancelled for mechanical reasons and since they don't answer their phones nor does their website work, I had to report to the airport early on the morning of 1/28 to find out what their plan was for re-routing me. After numerous lines bouncing back and forth, since neither knew what was happening, they said to go ahead and take the flight to Curacao but then they would not be responsible for me getting to Miami from there. My other option was to spend the night in Bonaire and we would try again same schedule the next morning. After much negotiation between the airline and all my fellow passengers who were trying to get to Miami, they agreed to put us up in hotel that night, pay for our meals and we would try same thing in morning of 1/29. I re-booked my American connection with at $209 change fee and trusted all would be well in morning. Around 6pm on 1/28 I learned by email that the flight from Curacao to Miami time had changed to much later in the day, once again rendering my American connection on 1/29 useless and leaving me having to look for lodging in Miami once I arrived and another flight from Miami to Denver on my own. On the morning of 1/29 I reported to the airport early again to board my first leg. I had nearly checked in when once again they cancelled the 2nd leg from Curacao to Miami for mechanical reasons. At that point I had to get home. I booked a horrendously expensive ticket to get home with another airline and watched all the others who were trying to figure out what to do after this connection cancelled again scurrying around looking for help. My return trip from Bonaire tripled in cost due to this airline leaving me stranded for 2 days. To avoid a travel nightmare, don't book with this airlines.

### "zero stars would be appropriate"
Curacao to Kingston return. Insel Air scheduled departure times are just fantasy! We suffered a 19 hours delay on flying from Curacao to Kingston on the 29th December, and close to 10 hours on the flight back on the 4th January. The lack of information during this waiting time was complete, with changing "new departure times" all the time, and even complete vanishing of the flight from the airport departure list. Delays as we suffered from are common, as we noticed on flying back from Curacao to Amserdam (thank goodness with KLM): the Curacao airport departure list that day (Jan 5) was filled with Insel Air flights with "new departure times" a few to many hours behind the original schedule. No single Insel Air flight was on time, not even the very short flights between Curacao and the adjacent Dutch Caribic islands Bonaire and Aruba. It is a pity I have to give at least one star and a minimal rating, where zero stars would be appropriate.

### "incompetent as I have ever seen"
Port of Spain to Curaçao. I unfortunately did not pay attention to the reviews of this airline, hoping it was a fluke. It really is that bad! They were unable to fulfil the original flight due to grounding its aircraft cause they couldn't afford the maintenance, they held us in the airport for 8 hours before finally releasing us to go to the hotel. Then the flight to take us to Curaçao was delayed which resulted in further delays and cancellations. As a result I lost a 2 night hotel stay as I was here. Then they held us here even after they knew we were not leaving and upon arrival they had no idea of any of the passengers situations. This company is a text book example of bad business. They are this incompetent as I have ever seen.

### "should be blacklisted"
Miami to Paramaribo via Curacao. Insel Air should be blacklisted. They rescheduled my flight twice, 13 days prior departure date. They changed it a day before but the connection to my final destination is to stay overnight in Curacao without any accommodations paid by the airline. The customer service is a joke. I called to complain and demand a change back of date, or help with the hotel accommodation/food or give me a refund. They said, I should file a complain to Customer relations because there is nothing they could do.

### "decided to cancel the early flight"
We just returned from our second vacation in Bonaire - both using Insel Air. In 2015 we naively booked flights from Aruba to Bonaire (because we could use miles to get to Aruba for free) on Insel. I read the reviews that were posted at that time but thought "it can't possibly be that bad. Boy was I wrong. Our first itinerary included the only non-stop between the Aruba and Bonaire. The day before our departure from the US we were notified that Insel had decided not to fly that route the next day and we had been rebooked on an itinerary with a plane change in Curacao. The only problem was that the new itinerary departed Aruba before we even arrived there. The next morning we received a phone call from them that put us on a previously nonexistent flight - at this point I had spent so much time on the phone with Insel that I knew their schedule by heart. So when I was told we were on this new flight, I said "you don't have a flight at that time! But I was assured that they had added the segment. At that point it was too late to do anything but continue with our plans. Upon arrival in Aruba we spent 90 minutes standing at the ticket counter while the agents tried to sort things out. In Curacao, they literally met us on the tarmac at the bottom of the stairs and walked us around the nose of another waiting plane (with the props already running) and loaded us on board. Once again, naively, we thought "wow - this is pretty cool that they would accommodate us like this. Silly us. When we finally arrived in Bonaire we were too late to pick up our rental car. Our return trip to Aruba via Curacao was also delayed on both legs, requiring us to run through the Aruba airport (where you also clear US customs). The only reason we made our flight to the US was because it was delayed. It is recommended that you allow 3 hours in Aruba for this process. We tried again this year - trying to save money and thinking (silly us) that last year was an aberration. Wrong again. We booked the itinerary, including US flights to connect in Aruba, 6 months out. Leading up to the trip Insel changed our schedule 4 times. Our flight from Curacao to Bonaire was delayed for 3 hours. Eventually we boarded one of the few 737s that they use (a very nice plane, BTW) for the 11 minute flight at 5000 feet. The only issue is that it took 45 minutes to board the flight. On our return flight, we had planned 4 hours in Aruba to clear customs. A month before our holiday departure, Insel decided to cancel the early flight and put us on a later one, leaving us once again with 2 hours in Aruba. Then the new flight from Curacao to Aruba was delayed 40 minutes. We contacted our US carrier to see what our options might be if we missed our connection and were told we would have to spend 2 nights in Aruba due to a lack of availability of seats - and come up with more than $2000 in airfare (plus housing) for the last minute change. When I explained this to Insel personnel, I was told that since we weren't connecting to another Insel flight, there was no recourse available to us. When I asked if they might ask others on a delayed departure (about to load) if any of them might give us their seats to leave 40 minutes later to allow us to make our connection and the response was "No".

### "treat their customers like dirt"
Insel is a poor excuse for an airline. They treat their customers like dirt. Flight from Curacao to Havana was informed to be 1 hours 10 minutes late at check-in October 3. The plane was present at the gate. 1 hour and 20 minutes after the original departure time the screen went black, no audio information. New sign on screen, the plane was now due for Miami! Asking about our flight to Havana we where informed it was delayed 4 days! come back on Friday. Most stupid thing ever heard, who on holiday can change their plans like that? It cost us approx. 200 USD on phone to get new hotel room at Curacao and to cancel our hotel in Havana. We still had to pay for the first night, another 115 USD. Also tried to call Insel Air which have so rude staff on the phone just saying no refund then put you back in the phone queue. Before this flight not taking place, we flew from Miami via Curacao to Bonaire, both flight very much delayed, arriving at Bonaire after rental cars had closed so we could not pick up our car. Also from Bonaire back to Curacao, delayed. So before cancel to Havana three flights all delayed. We noticed that the flight to Miami that was announced instead of Havana was three hours late, so we realized that we had to rebook our return ticket from Curacao to Miami as we had connecting flights going back to Europe. These new tickets by another airline company also cost us. After trying to communicate with Insel, which is more or less a one way communication, we finally got information that our flight CUR-HAV-CUR is valid one year, same for our flight CUR-MIA. However they do not understand that people in Europe very seldom have the possibility to travel this far every year, we cannot afford it anyway, so we have absolutely no use off that offer.

### "flight continues to be delayed"
Miami to Curaçao with Insel Air. Sitting here at Miami waiting for my flight that may not happen. Flight time has changed 3 times already. When I arrived to check in they did not mention the flight was delayed until I asked. While waiting at the gate the flight continues to be delayed and the gates changing without any notice or announcements. I find this to be unprofessional. I'm hoping I can make it to where I'm going today.

### "staff don't speak good English"
Miami to Curacao with Insel Air. The worst airline I had experienced so far. I am waiting to take a flight which was suppose to leave 5 hours ago. The staff don't speak good English (at least good enough to work in an international airline company) and I don't have idea why this flight is so late. I am wondering if I'm going to take this flight, as they have changed the time 3 times already. I have 2 more connections that I am almost sure I'm not going to be able to catch. I do not recommend this company.

### "ok but not the best choice"
We (2 adults / 2 kids) had 3 flights between Aruba and Curacao with Insel Air in October / November 2016. Fokker 50 Airplane was very old and the interior was in a poor shape. Armrests and seats were partially fixed by tape and some seat backrests could not be adjusted at all or were broken. Some investment in a new cabin would be highly appreciated. From Curacao to Aruba we had a MD83 which was also old but acceptable / good condition. No food and drinks were served but it's only a 20min trip so no problem. No entertainment, but only 20min. The flights itself were smooth and easy - no problems. The landings were perfect too. Cabin crew / ground staff was also friendly and ok. But what annoyed me was the behavior of the airline before the flight. The flight to Aruba was cancelled 2min before departure without any explanation or sorry. 8US$ compensation per person and a new "on time departure" 4h later are not acceptable. The first flight from Aruba to Curacao (connecting hub - organized by KLM) was also 3h too late - also without any explanation. Only the third and last flight back to Curacao was 100% on time. So 2 out of 3 flights delayed. So underlined - Insel Air is ok but not the best choice. Unfortunately there is no real possibility to choose any other airline if you would like to travel between the ABC islands.

### "service is beneath acceptable"
Bonaire to Aruba via Curacao with Insel Air. Worst airline ever. Had 2 flights and both of them were delayed several hours. We spent 7 hours waiting today without further notice. Airplanes are old and dirty. Service is beneath acceptable. Choose another airline if you can - this will ruin all of your plans.

### "staff are rude"
Saint Martin to Curacao with Insel Air. I don't have words enough to tell you how bad this airline is. It took me 11 hours (normally takes an hour) to fly from Saint Martin to Curacao. Even worst was that they didn't tell anyone what was going on. No restitution was offered, no hotel, nothing. And flying back same thing. Staff are rude, almost anti-social.

### "always delay flights"
Insel Air is the worst airline I have ever been on. Flying from Aruba to Curacao is a 20 minute flight, yet they always delay flights for several hours without notifying anyone. Flown with Insel twice, the first time I flew with them I was told the airplane left early. What type of airline does that? Leave early without notifying any passengers. Staff are rude, airplanes are old, never stick to schedule. I would suggest flying with any other airline.

### "the flight was delayed"
My flight to Curacao was scheduled for October 05 at 6.40am, however on arriving at the checking counter I was told that the flight was delayed. After waiting for 4 hours I was then told the flight was cancelled. A taxi was offered to take me home and return the next day as the flight was now scheduled to depart at 5.30pm. Again on arriving at the checking counter I was told the flight was now delayed by 4 hours. The flight eventually left at 9.30 pm. Curacao is a very nice island but would not recommend to my friends to visit until there is a reliable option from Trinidad and Tobago.

### "airline is a disgrace"
Curaçao to Georgetown. Arriving by KLM from Amsterdam to Curaçao on 25th Sept, I was first told that my flight to Georgetown was 3 hours late, then shortly that it was cancelled and that I would fly 24 hours later. Upon arrival at the airport the the following evening, I was again told that the flight was cancelled and would fly the following morning, which eventually did happen. On top of the 36 hours delay, the only services provided by the airline were accommodation (and meals) in mediocre hotels (where I met other Insel Air passengers having been delayed five days to go to Trinidad and who had declined the hotel they had first been offered). Ground staff services at the airport were really disorganised and appalling. The MD-80 I eventually flew on, was clearly very old and shabby. This airline is a disgrace. Reputable airlines and travel agencies should avoid offering InselAir connecting flights.

### "they all mock the airline"
My wife and I had planned a vacation for Aruba and Curacao. We flew into Curacao on United and everything went great. We had a fantastic time in Aruba and were looking forward to spending some time in Curacao. Our flight out of Aruba was scheduled to leave at 11:50 in the morning. We arrived at the check in counter over an hour before the flight was supposed to leave. The board above the counter listed a departure time of 11:50. There was no one at the counter. We waited for fifteen minutes and then started asking other airline agents if they had seen anyone from InselAir. No one had and suggested that we go out to InselAir's office outside the check in area. When we got to their office there were three people working the counter and all of them were playing on their phones. Even after I had walked up to the counter it took several minutes for one of them to look up and assist me. I inquired as to the status of our flight and after about 20 minutes of runaround and growing frustration I was finally told that the flight had left at 11:10, forty minutes early. I was incensed and asked why we had not been notified about the change, to which I was given a reply that it wasn't their responsibility but rather that of the booking agent (Orbitz). I called Orbitz and they told me that they had not received any notification by InselAir for a change in schedule. InselAir countered by saying that changes to flight times are made at least 24 hours in advance and that Orbitz had been notified. InselAir offered to put us on a flight that left that night, at 8:40. The problem with that was that by the time the flight made it to Curacao at 9:30 the lobby of our hotel would have been closed as Sundays are holidays and everything closes early. We would have had no place to stay so out of necessity we stayed in Aruba. Our itinerary had us coming back on InselAir to Aruba at the end of the week so that we could catch our return flight home on United. This was a flight we had to make as our 12 year old son was flying home the next day from visiting relatives and we had to be at the airport to pick him up. Based on reviews of InselAir and talking to some locals we quickly realized that this airline pulls last second schedule changes all the time, is routinely late, will delay flights and not give any reason and often times cancels flights for no reason. As we have to be home to be able to pick up our son we could not put our trust into InselAir to get us back to Aruba to catch our flight home, so we ended up cancelling our entire trip to Curacao. InselAir staff acted as if they could care less about our predicament. We were talked down to, we were asked to wait while the staff played on their phones, we were given the runaround repeatedly and it took my getting very angry before they even started to give us an answer. The unprofessional-ism of this airline and its representatives is appalling. The fact that they would make a schedule change and have a flight leave early is appalling in and of itself, but the fact that no notifications were sent out is abhorrent and reprehensible. All of the locals here in Aruba have said that they never fly InselAir because of the exact same issues we had and they all mock the airline. As a result of InselAir's utter incompetence we're out several thousand dollars for prepaid hotels and activities. InselAir put a serious damper on what had been up to that point a very pleasant vacation.

### "take it or leave it attitude"
Miami to Port-au-Prince  return. Insel Air is the most disconsidered and negligent airline I have experienced. Waited for all of 6 hour at MIA airport with out any communication as to departure time or reason for delay - take it or leave it attitude. The return was canceled at the last minute claiming bad weather. Interestingly other airlines were flying to MIA with no problems. Airport was not closed. No reimbursement for expenses on hotels or meals. Add insult to injury, was requested to be at airport next morning at 6:35am for another delay till 12:00 noon. I would not fly with them if they gifted the ticket.

### "the worst airline I have used"
Our InselAir flight from Curacao to Aruba was cancelled and we had to wait 9 hours for the next flight. The flight back was delayed only 30 minutes but another gate was used without changing the information screens or making a announcement. This was the worst airline I have used.

### "staff were average at best"
Insel Air - horrible experience. From the minute we got onboard, it was extremely hot and the AC didn't kick in until we had been on the runway for a few minutes. Even worse, we sat at the gate for an extra 20 minutes sweating while the aircraft waited for "parts" (per the pilots announcement). The staff were average at best, with customer service. The drinks were offered early but there was no alcohol because the "machine was down". They could not accept cash either. There was no inflight entertainment or monitors. No wifi options. Pretzels and peanuts were offered as the only snack (3 hour flight 3-6pm). The snacks were extremely stale and the peanuts were so stale they were soft. The expiration dates were 5/5/2016 and 5/10/2016 respectively which were two months post expiration as of the date of our flight. They shouldn't have even been served. But this was "all they had". Needless to say, this was not only the worse flight I've taken, and least accommodating, but it's the only time I have gone online to provide such feedback about any airline, restaurant or service. I'm still in shock.

### "sitting with no information"
Insel Air is probably the worst airline I have flown. I had a ticket from Caracas to Curacao on June 23 leaving at 10.30pm. A week ago they changed the flight time to 07.40am. I emailed them to say that this didn't suit me because I had a connecting flight that afternoon but received no response. To leave Venezuela I had to forfeit my ticket and purchase another ticket out and could only get a ticket to Aruba at short notice. When I arrived I went to the Insel office to explain my situation. They said I had to pay a $110 penalty to fly to Curacao to make my connection. The flight from Curacao to Santo Domingo was delayed 2 hours, finally after leaving and 1 hour into the fight we turned back to Curacao because of mechanical problems. Right now we are sitting in the transit lounge with no information about what happens next. Avoid this airline at all costs.

### "no communication, leadership or guidance"
My Insel Air flight from Paramaribo to Curacao was on time. The next leg, to Kingston was delayed by six hours. There was no communication, leadership or guidance of any kind provided to passengers. There was not even a gesture of apology. The counter staff were calloused and rude. My return flight was also delayed. Whoever is in charge of this Airline, hopefully they bother to read reviews, need to correct these consistent delays, public relations insults, and ticketing glitches, from the top down as soon as possible.

### "delays were not communicated"
Curacao to Bonaire with Insel Air. Original flight time 9:10 AM - 9:30 AM. We chose it so we could get enough sleep and still be at our destination early enough to go scuba diving that day. 2 days prior to departure we were informed by email that our departure time was changed to an earlier hour, i.e. to 7:15 AM. Since Insel Air asks you to be at the airport 3 hours prior to departure, we got up at 4:30 AM in the morning. There was no request to confirm that you had received said email. As soon as we arrived at the gate in the airport, we were informed that the flight was delayed from 7:15 AM to 8:45 AM. We were quite annoyed because that meant we could have just as well slept long enough. After waiting for an hour, we were informed that the new departure time was now 09:40 AM. We were also informed that the 07:15 flight was cancelled and everybody was simply booked onto the next regular flight. Everybody got an $8 snack voucher. Until then, the communication at the gate had been relatively professional, every delay was displayed on the gate monitor. From now on, however, no more communication. Departure gate was changed from gate 2 to 6, but until departure it was never shown on the gate monitors. We had to follow the crowd to find our new gate. All additional delays were not communicated in any way. At 09:45 AM still no boarding. When we asked at the gate, we were informed that there was an additional delay and departure time was now scheduled for 10:15 AM. At 10:15 AM, we were not boarded. Boarding finally started at 10:20 AM, departure around 10:40 AM, arrival around 11:00 AM. On the plane, we were told that all seat reservations were cancelled and that everybody should just sit down wherever they wanted. We were lucky to be early so we could still find 2 adjacent seats. After arrival at Bonaire airport, we were shocked to learn that there had been no luggage at all loaded into the plane. Insel Air somehow managed to fly about 100 passengers but left all of their luggage in Curacao. There was now a long queue in front of the "lost baggage" counter. When we were up, our boarding pass number was written down on a piece of paper, nothing more. When we asked about the further proceedings, we were informed that the luggage could not be brought to our hotel. Instead, we would have to come back to the airport and pick it up. They could not tell us at what time that would be possible, and only after repeatedly asking, they wrote down our phone number and promised to call us when the luggage was there to pick up - they never called. After not hearing anything from Insel Air, we drove to the airport at 15:00 PM and luckily, it was there

### "don't use Insel Air"
Curacao to Bonaire with Insel Air - this is a 15 min flight. My flight was at 7am. I needed to check in before 6am. At check-in they simply told me the flight was now at 9.15am and boarding at 8.45am. No reason, no sorry, nothing. I had to wait 2 hours and was to late for my business meeting. Great thing about CUR-BON is you receive your return ticket at departure check-in. This means you can usually walk in 15 min before flying and you're still in time. This usually works great, but I received a call from Insel Air at 6.40pm when just starting with my main course at my business dinner. Your flight is leaving 1h15m earlier. I had to be in at 7.30pm instead of 9pm. Hurried my dinner and business meeting, turned in my car and was in at 7.29pm. This was stupid of me of course because Insel Air never do what they say. I flew at 9.20pm (5 min later than my normal flight). Meaning I hurried for nothing and lost a total of 5 hours of business in Bonaire on a round flight of only 30 min. I really hate this airline and don't understand that they can do this everytime. They cancel flights like it's nothing just to fill up 1 plane. If there is another alternative please use it and don't use Insel Air.

### "avoid this airline like the plague"
This was my worst experience since travelling. On my arrival in Trinidad, instead of collecting both pieces of luggage for me and my husband, we only received one. We filled out a PIR form. We were first told the next day Wednesday another flight will bring it. The next day I called and they said the flight is coming in at 4pm. When I called again, they said 6pm instead. I called again, and they said 1pm the next day Thursday. I called again and they said 1pm on Fri. They also confirmed that Curacao said they have the luggage. When I called at 2:15pm on Friday, they said the flight is coming in at 11pm. An agent called my husband and told him Curacao said they do not have the luggage. I call soon after and another agent said he has to resend the e-mail to Curacao, that they got no response from Curacao, but the flight is coming in at 11pm and hopefully our luggage will be in it. They will call us. Well I am waiting to hear what other story they are concocting next. Please avoid this airline like the plague. If you want stress you can travel with them.

### "long and disturbing story"
Kingston to Santo Domingo via Curacao with Insel Air. A long and disturbing story, our scheduled flight was for around 10.00 yesterday morning but the flight was delayed until 10.30pm! We asked if we could go on the Copa Airlines flight at 3.30 pm via Panama but we were told that Insel had no arrangements with Copa and so the answer was no. We were then left stranded for more than 12 hours. When we returned to the airport at 8.00 the flight did not leave until almost midnight, delivering us in Curaçao 2 hours 45 mins later. Exhausted we left the plane and were directed by one of the ground staff to a lady who asked a couple of questions but continued to go about her business - after a while I asked her what was going on and could I please have the vouchers her colleague told us that she would give to us? Reluctantly she started to write out a set of vouchers out of which she gave us - I also asked her if I could have the third which was a taxi voucher to tke us to our hotel, this she refused to give us as she said she couldn't as she had to wait for other passengers. I told her that my wife was recovering from surgery and it was imperative that we got to our beds as soon as possible but she basically said it was "her way or the highway! After about an hour we decided to take the cab ourselves and armed with our hotel voucher and our return taxi voucher we went looking for a cab - we found one but the problem was that for this 10 mins ride they wanted 50USD and didn't tke a credit card. We had no choice but to return to this lady, clearly we couldn't go back through customs and so a customs officer called her - she didn't come immediately but when she did she verbally abused my wife and I suggesting she was doing us some sort of favor This abuse took the form of speaking Flemish and continued all the way up to the cab stand sounding off to anyone who would listen. We entered the cab and for a full 5 minutes she continued this abuse with our cab driver as she reluctantly wrote out our voucher. We left that airport in the cab nearly an hour and a half after landing at 3.00 in the morning, only to be taken to a hotel that was closed? This story goes on and on but we didn't get to a bed until after 5am. This member of staff was a disgrace and a complete opposite to another lady who eventually arranged our hotel room. To sum up if Insel Air is employing staff such as the one we encountered, this sends a clear message that the airline does not care for its stranded passengers!

### "attendants kind and attentive"
We were flying Insel Air from St Maarten to Curacao. We quickly passed through check in and security. The flight was delayed by 2-3 hours coming from Santo Domingo so we just sat in the almost empty terminal. We boarded via the stairs. The aircraft wasnt the cleanest, and it had the not so pretty green Alitalia seats and there was water leaking from the AC vents a few rows behind me. We were served a little snack on the flight and there was a raffle in which you can win back your ticket. The flight attendants were kind and attentive.

### "cabin service adequate"
We read all the bad reviews but our flight to Bonaire left about 15 minutes late from Miami which is not unusual for most carriers. We changed flights in Curacao and that flight to Bonaire was on time. Our return flight also was uneventful however the air craft was what appeared to need some work on the cabin (minor repairs). The flight cost was at least 400 dollars cheaper than flying Delta. The cabin service was adequate.

### "satisfaction is a foreign word"
We flew from St Maarten to Bonaire via Curacao. When we checked in we were told that the flight would start 7 hours later. In fact, the delay came up to 8 hours. We got a voucher 8$, but in St. Maarten you cannot buy much more than a cappuccino for 8$. Because we started so late we had to stay Curacao overnight in a hotel were the bar was already closed, so we had to drink water from the tap. We reached Bonaire a day later. The staff could give us no reason for the delay of the flight and the so-called Supervisors were disinterested, unfriendly and incompetent and arrogant. There was no compensation for the rental car and the hotel already booked on Bonaire. Customer satisfaction is a foreign word for "Island air".

### "definitely fly Insel Air again"
Bonaire to Aruba via Curacao with Insel Air. We had a very satisfactory flight returning home. The counter staff and cabin staff were friendly and helpful. We arrived on time. Economy seats are economy seats. The flights are too short for any entertainment, but they have a good flight magazine. As with other reviews, I agree that the sound system on the plane is inaudible. Most important, our luggage arrived with us at our destination, without damage. We would definitely fly Insel Air again.

### "staff was helpful and good"
It is true that the flight started the boarding 20 min late, the airplane is not the newest and it is hard to hear the staff's alerts, because the sound equipament makes a lot of noise. But the amount that I paid for the ticket was good. The staff was helpful and good. The service during the flight was excellent, with complimentary food, candy and beverages. If you are taking the flight from Miami to Central-South America, I suggest you to fly during the day. My flight was in the afternoon and I had the pleasure to see Miami coast as well a lot of the Carribean islands. It is not all the flights that you take in life that will give this opportunity to you. The company's magazine is worth to "take home". They have an onboard raffle and stop the raffle when someone win!

### "avoid these guys"
We booked Insel Air nonstops from Aruba to Bonaire and back. They changed the flights to stop in Curacao both ways. We actually left on time and on arrival in Bonaire they said they did not bring the luggage. It was kept for weight. Anyway they said they would deliver it in the morning or we could come back and pick it up. We said deliver not realizing it would take 8 phone calls and 8 hours to finally get it. One man we saw said it took him two days to get his. 5 employees at the check in counter but only one working. The locals say bad service is the norm for Insel Air. There planes stink and they do not care about customers at all. They tell you what is most convenient for them. We saw other passengers treated poorly. I will do whatever it takes no matter the cost to avoid these guys.

### Insel Air customer review
Insel Air flight from Miami to Manaus via Curacao started boarding 20 min late. The airplane was not the newest or most high-tech and it was hard to hear the staff announcements because the sound equipment makes a lot of noise. However, for the amount that I paid for the ticket the staff was very helpful. The service during the flight was excellent, with complimentary food (which is rare for a 4-hours flight), candy and beverages (they stopped at my seat twice). If you are taking the flight from Miami to Central-South America, I suggest you fly during the day. My flight was in the afternoon and I had the experience of seeing the Miami Coast as well a lot of the Caribbean Islands. The company's magazine is made to "take home". Beautiful pictures, nice articles in Spanish and in English, and a lot of useful travel tips. The seats are old style, therefore your body will never be squeezed between your seat and the seat in front of you - plenty of space to relax. They also had an onboard raffle.

### "think twice before you use"
Insel Air has to be the worst airline. Our bad experience started when we traveled from Miami to Aruba when our flight was delayed 7 hours, when we arrived to Aruba it was 1:00 am and had to pay $70 for a cab because the car rental place was closed. Then on our return flight on December 30th it was again delayed for 2 hours then when we finally took flight the airplane was returned to Aruba due to another malfunction, then we stayed in the airport another 8 hours and lost our connecting flights in Miami, the airline is using old airplanes from the 70's and 80's with visual wear and tear. The attendants at the airport are clueless to say the least, all the said was "I don't know". I really regret saving $180 per ticket compared to American Airlines for the same route. I guess that you get what you pay for. I someone ever thinks to flight to Aruba or Curacao think twice before you use this lame and awful airline.

### "a very bad experience"
The entire experience was a mess with Insel Air. First, they were checking in for later flights for at least 3 hours before my flight. Then, when it was an hour before the flight was scheduled, they started checking us in. At the counter, I was told that the 20h15 flight would now be at 1h45 in the morning. I was also told that I was a standby, which I was not as I had a confirmed ticket (I'm not the only one this happened to). They gave us no food vouchers. This was regulated and then I proceeded through security and at the gate, the board stated that the flight would be leaving at 2h45 in the morning. No reasons were given and no announcements were made. They eventually changed this again to 12:00am, and we boarded at 23h30. During the flight we were given the wrong customs card to fill out. This was overall a very bad experience and I along with many people on that flight will never fly Insel Air again.

### "unfriendly with customers"
Insel Air from Miami to Aruba on 11/21/2015 was delayed for 6 hours. Scheduled dep time was 15:00, actual dep was 21:00 - reason given was maintenance issues with plane. I had a connecting flight from Aruba to Bonaire (flight#431), which had left already at the time of arrival in Aruba. We, the passengers, were told that flight 431 would wait for us in Aruba for the flight to Bonaire, which was not the case. We were told that there is another flight at 9:00 to bring us to Bonaire, which was not the case either. We eventually were flown out from Aruba to Bonaire at 4:30 on 11/22 and arrived a whole day late. I booked hotel and scuba diving excursions which were lost to me. The return flight from Bonaire to Curacao (flight #302) on 11/24/2015, which was scheduled to depart at 7:00, actually departed at 09:00. The flight from Curacao to Miami on 11/24/2015 was scheduled to depart at 10:00, but was delayed again to 22:00, which was a 12 hour delay! Reason again: maintenance issues with the plane. I purchased a ticket on AA from Curacao to Miami, which departed on time at 16:20. I paid $219 for the AA flight back to Miami. I asked Inselair repeatedly to issue either a partial refund or voucher and/or pay for my return ticket form Curacao to Miami on 11/24 with AA in the amount of $219. The airline declined to offer any reimbursement for these extensive delays on both outbound and return flights. In my opinion, this airline is also extremely unfriendly with customers. The passengers were repeatedly lied to by the ground personnel and station managers in Miami and Curacao. We were repeatedly told that the plane from Aruba to Bonaire (flight #431) would wait for us in Aruba, which as not the case.

### "flight was cancelled"
A quarter of an hour before departure we got the message that the Insel Air flight was cancelled. No additional information was available. All we got is a coupon for 8 dollar, and at Curaçao Hato airport not a single meal could be bought. Finally after a delay of 3.5 hours we arrived at Bonaire, for a flight of 25 minutes.

### Insel Air customer review
I traveled with Insel air June this year from Aruba via Curacao to Suriname. At the check-in counter I asked the lady to label my luggage all the way to Suriname. In Curacao I discovered that it was not done and since I was in transit they had to intercept my luggage and change labels. After 2 hours and repeatedly asking it was finally done. We had a delay of approx. 1 hour. The aircraft was pretty old and packed with embassy and refinery people and there was a fight about a seat police had to escort a couple off the plane which resulted in another 45 minutes delay. Cabin staff mishandled the issue and shouldn't have allowed the 'back and forth' scenario. My return flight date had to be postponed so I sent Insel Curacao an email followed up with calls to Curacao but the person in charge was never available. After a lot of calls and emails we never got an answer. I decided to fly SLM back to avoid more issues with Insel Air.

### Insel Air customer review
August 2014 Aruba-Curacao-Bonaire Bonaire-Curacao Curacao-Miami - All of the flights were late but without any explanation. In Curacao for the flight to Miami we could see the plane being loaded and fuelled over an hour before take off but they said they could only board one flight at a time and the three earlier flights to other destinations were late and we had to wait for them to board until we did. Took off nearly 1 hour late. On the flight to Bonaire we took off from Aruba nearly 2 hours late. When we got to Curacao we were rushed off the plane to the terminal through security and then rushed back onto the plane we had just come off!! When we asked why we could not have just stayed on the plane we were told they had not thought of that. Terrible customer service and some of the oldest planes I have flown on for a long time. My seat was coming apart on the Miami flight.

### Insel Air customer review
June 2014 - we booked tickets in April for our flight on Saturday June 21. We got an email the night before our flight that the flight had been cancelled and would depart on Sunday instead. When we arrived at Miami airport to check in on Sunday the agent said we never fly to Aruba on Saturdays! That flight ended up being 3 hours late leaving Miami. To make it worse our return flight messed up our luggage and took it to the wrong terminal and it all had to be searched by customs again. We sat in Miami airport for 5 hours after arriving to get our luggage. When we asked for information or what was being done no one could tell us! The plane was dirty and shabby. The worst airline experience.

### Insel Air customer review
February 7 2014 Caracas-Curacao-Aruba. The ticket was expensive for a short distance of little more than 1 hour total travel time. We experienced the following disaster: 3 Insel staff told me that a boarding pass would be issued to us for the Curacao-Aruba portion of our trip when we arrived in Curacao instead of being issued in Caracas. In Curacao no plane had been scheduled to take us to Aruba. No explanation was given about what transportation was available until we demanded answers. No flight numbers were ever posted in Curacao for the leg of my trip to Aruba. I received different versions of why my flight was not available from staff. After hours of negotiation with different airline staff a flight was put together for us and other upset customers. It left late in the day and caused many persons including us to miss their connecting flights out of Aruba and to forfeit their tickets on other airlines. I arrived 3 days late to my destination in the USA.

### Insel Air customer review
My family just returned from a nice vacation at Curacao. We flew Insel Air from Charlotte NC direct to Curacao. No complaints regarding the outbound and return flights. The outbound flight was on time and the return flight was ~ 30 minutes delayed. Insel's customer service was above par. Previously to taking the flight I was sceptical about flying on Insel given some of the reviews however our experience was quite good so we will definitely fly Insel again.

### Insel Air customer review
21 Jan 2014 BON-CUR-MDE. We booked a flight from Bonaire via Curacao with destination Medellin. The flight from Bonaire should leave at 7.55 am but had a delay of 1 hour and 15 minutes. The worst was the delay at Curacao: instead of leaving at 10.10am the new estimated time of departure is 4.30pm a delay of more than 6 hours. If possible we will never choose Insel Air again we will be happy to pay a little more for a reliable airline.

### Insel Air customer review
We just returned from a super week on Bonaire traveling both ways on Insel Air. The service by all airline staff from check in to leaving today was absolutely fantastic. On time for each stage for the trip from Charlotte and back. We were concerned after reading some earlier reviews but our experience was top notch. Will fly again next time on Insel.

### Insel Air customer review
CUR-SXM. Flight departed 10 mins early and good service on board. Snack and a beverage on a 1:15 flight. Overall very attentive cabin crew and friendly pilot. We arrived in St Maarten early luggage already on the belt when we passed through immigration. Would recommend Insel air. They have improved a lot since last year.

### Insel Air customer review
Return flight from Curaçao to Charlotte was delayed a day. They fed us well put us in a nice hotel overnight handled all transportation and got us on our way the next morning. Given their low cost and generous luggage allowance I would not hesitate to recommend them. I'd recommend building in an extra day's leeway for return travel just in case regardless of which airline you fly.

### Insel Air customer review
Flight from Charlotte to Curacao was an hour delayed no reason given that was minor compared to what happened next. Once airborne mechanical problems forced us back to Charlotte. That was fine we got off in an orderly fashion only to sit at the gate for what ended up being 10 hours. No one knew what was happening unless you went up and asked. Very few announcements were ever made. The airport shut down at 10pm so nowhere to buy water etc. Once a plane arrived the skybridge would not fit. We had to climb down some stairs walk across the tarmac and enter the back end of the plane. Everyone was by then exhausted and cranky. We ended out being awake for 39 hours straight as we had other connecting flights. We will never fly Insel again. Note our return flight was an hour and a half delayed no reason given.

### Insel Air customer review
Have flown Insel multiple times from MIA to PAP. Good service small but good meals served for free and ticket price is always better than others. Crew is friendly and helpful. MD-80 aircraft is older but comfortable and appears well maintained. Smooth on-time flights every time I've flown with them. Looking forward to flying Insel again soon.

### Insel Air customer review
As a professional and frequent traveler on other airlines I had tried Insel Air and was choked by the poor service and treatment given to passengers on flight from Miami to Haiti on June 19 2012. An apology would be in order. Also all announcements are made in English there should be at least one Haitian hostess speaking both French and Creole. Hostesses on board were inexperienced. If Insel is not ready to service this line they should withdraw themselves until able to do so respectfully. Plane leaves full every time meaning that this route is profitable to the company. Hope my next review will be more positive.

### Insel Air customer review
Miami to Valencia Venezuela with stops in Curacao return. I have to say that all flights departed on time. Service was good. They served a small snack on the way to and from Miami. Planes were MD80's and looked a little old inside. Flight attendants were courteous and well dressed. Price was low ($780 round trip) which is the cheapest I've seen.

### Insel Air customer review
Long Haul equipment is very old and run down MD80's. The interiors are dirty baths filthy and the seats worn out. We had a 10 hour maintenance delay. The gate agents were either uninformed or embarrassed to share updates. Everyone missed connections and were forced to find a hotel room in Charlotte at their own expense. The service was poor.

### Insel Air customer review
Curacao-Medellin. The outbound flight had a delay of 1 hr 15 mins without warning. The single-cabin MD-83 was clean with Christmas decorations and with a fresh smell. Although the crew appeared chaotic the service was great. Fresh sandwiches beverages and coffee were served free of charge. Medellin-Curacao. Departed with a 20 mins delay. The crew behaved professionally and a free breakfast was served. The flight was comfortable uneventful and ended with a smooth touch-down in Curacao. Baggage arrived quickly on the belt. I would fly Insel Air again for the price but I prefer Avianca because of the inflight entertainment and customer service.

### Insel Air customer review
I have flow Curacao-Valencia / Valencia-Curacao several times. I don't have much to complain about. The flight's usually didn't have delays and most of the delays were at Valencia where local authorities decided to increase security at the airport causing delays in flights. Aircraft's look old (MD-82) but they are comfortable and clean and the crew are friendly. We didn't have food or drinks inflight I suppose it's because the CUR- VAL route is only a 30 min flight. You spend most of that time filling the Venezuelan immigration papers.

### Insel Air customer review
Aruba-Curacao-Aruba. The inter-island flights with a Fokker 50 had a delay on both legs. The cabin interior looked old with a few broken items in the cabin and filthy ashtrays. What I couldn't appreciate was the nasty smell coming out of the toilet and filling the whole cabin. The cabin attendant seemed grumpy. We had a smooth ride and a soft landing.

### Insel Air customer review
Caracas-Curacao Curacao-Charlotte. Every flight at least 2 hours delayed without warning. On the return flight (Charlotte-Curacao) the flight was delayed and ultimately cancelled. We were then shipped to Aruba on another airline (where we were forced to pay additional fees) and told by Insel employees that we would have to figure out our way home from Aruba. Their lack of organization inability to maintain a timely schedule and complete absence of reliable customer service makes this airline by far the worst airline I have ever encountered.

### Insel Air customer review
Curacao to Bonaire. Informed the flight was 30 mins late before arriving at the airport no further word after that. At the airport 12 of us were told our 5 pm flight "Didn't exist". We were kept waiting with no information and no alternatives. Instead of arriving 5.25 pm in Bonaire we arrived at midnight after flying to Aruba first. Luggage arrived the following day. Needless to say we were frustrated and exhausted. This is not what we wait all year for.

### Insel Air customer review
Had two flights booked. BON-CUR was late but got us there. The other one CUR-AUA was delayed 4 hrs (should leave at 18.30 but was scheduled to leave at 22.30) because of that I lost my flight back home and had to buy tickets from Avianca at the last moment. Their aircraft's are not reliable safety instructions are poorly conducted and the crew amateur at best.

### Insel Air customer review
Return flight scheduled for Curacao to Charlotte first delayed and after six hours told it was cancelled due to mechanical problems. Two more hours before taken to a hotel Insel said they would call with flight rescheduling however as expected they never called. Finally got my travel agent to reschedule through Insel on USAir Insel said they'd send a taxi to get us although this never arrived.

### Insel Air customer review
Pay the extra money and choose another airline. Port Au Prince Haiti to Miami and the flight was scheduled to leave at 1020am. We finally left at 8pm! They had to lease a jet to bring the travelers from Miami and pick us up. During the long day of waiting there was one update and lots of misinformation. The website was never updated. They did feed us late in the afternoon.

### Insel Air customer review
BON-CUR-SXM. It was my first time flying Insel and I can say it was better than many other Caribbean airlines! Flights on time snacks served after take off and no tax or extra bag fees! The price was fair and some dollars cheaper than its competitors. Funny to listen the announcements in Papiamentu (only some thousands speak it?) Well I give Insel 3 and a half stars! Will fly them again!

### Insel Air customer review
CLT-CUR. Check in was slow but it was their first week or so on this new route. Both legs the flights were smooth not packed staff was friendly. I felt like I had hit a time warp when they offered beverage a meal food was decent. Only complaint the return flight rear bathroom could be smelled at least 2 rows away nasty!

### Insel Air customer review
Never had a worse experience! I booked my flight in August. Two days before my flight in December Insel Air contacted me telling me my flight had been cancelled in September! I had to do everything in my power to get us to Bonaire before Christmas while the company had the attitude that it now was my problem not theirs. Although all their airplanes are old and I knew this upfront flying back we had the oldest airplane I ever been in. Seats falling apart dirty plane dirty trays dirty restroom and a pilot that clearly needed a few more lessons in take-off and landing. The plane smelled like sewer half way to Miami. I will never fly with Insel Air again.

### Insel Air customer review
Terrible airline - transferred me on to different flights even though booked months in advance - implying a schedule change but later found out that the original flights were still scheduled. Did not respond to my e-mails regarding this. Flight safety questionable with no safety briefing or clarification re persons sitting in exit rows. Would never use them again.

### Insel Air customer review
Curacao to Aruba. Ground staff very friendly. Flights on time. The plane (Embraer) was old but the flight went well both times.

### Insel Air customer review
CUR-MIA-CUR MD-82. Check in took just a few minutes since I was very early at the airport. The check-in staff was helpful however informed me of a delay of minimal 4 hours. The pax received a food voucher. The flight was fully booked and service on board was great. We even got a small meal. The return flight was on time and as with the first flight the service on board was great compared to American Airlines. Again a small meal and free beverage service. The planes look a bit old from the inside but were very clean.
