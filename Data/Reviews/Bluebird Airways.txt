### "rubbish across the board"
Bluebird Airways notified me on a change 1 day before the departure, and the flight was brought earlier so that I wasn't able to make it. The company doesn't have any contact numbers to call, the ones I could find weren't answering or disconnected. The airline doesn't provide rebooking or refund options even though they made the change, so BlueBird is an absolute rubbish across the board. Avoid these scammers at all cost. If I could give a negative score, I would.

### "do not recommend this airline"
Terrible experience with BlueBird Airways! At check-in for flight BZ131 from Rome to Tel Aviv on 23/03/2025, I was forced to pay an additional fee for my trolley, even though it met all carry-on requirements for size and weight, and was paid for with my ticket. The check-in agent didn't measure my luggage, just visually assessed it. This was completely unjustified and caused me financial loss and stress. I will never fly with BlueBird Airways again and do not recommend this airline to anyone.

### “Lack of Customer Service”
My experience with Bluebird Airlines was extremely disappointing, and unfortunately, I cannot recommend them. Flight to Greece – Cancellation and Lack of Customer Service. My flight to Greece was canceled just two days in advance, causing significant disruption to my plans. While the airline offered a refund or an alternative flight, the new flight was delayed by four hours, which was far from ideal. I tried contacting customer service to explore other options, but there was no response at all. A non-existent customer service team is a major drawback in the airline industry, where passengers often require immediate assistance. Seating Issues – Paid for a Seat I Didn't Get. I paid extra to select a seat at the front of the plane by the window, yet I was assigned a seat at the back of the plane by the aisle. This is completely unacceptable and a clear case of misleading passengers. Return Flight – Excess Baggage Fees, Rude Staff, and Gate Change at the Last Minute. On my return flight, I was charged for 3 kg of excess baggage, even though my suitcase weighed only 11 kg instead of the allowed 8 kg. To make matters worse, the flight manager was rude and unprofessional, making it almost impossible to have a reasonable conversation. Adding to the chaos, the boarding gate was changed at the last minute without prior notice, nearly causing me to miss my flight. This is a serious failure in passenger communication. Conclusion – Poor Service, Disrespectful Staff, and Lack of Reliability. There is no customer support, check-in staff share the same unhelpful attitude, and the airline does not uphold its basic commitments regarding seating or baggage policies. For these reasons, I strongly advise against flying with this airline and recommend choosing a more reliable company.

### "did everything to help me"
I was stopped by the airport because i had a problem with my passport, the bluebird staff did everything to help me get on the plane on time. The staff ran with me to the place where they make you a new passport, and the Security head took me in his car to the airplane, they all did a great effort to let me fly to my destination and not cancel it. Thank you guys!

### "a great flight overall"
On the way to Prague, Bluebird chartered out to an AKL aeroplane, which was cramped and the service terrible. But on return, on an actual Bluebird plane, the flight was wonderful. Clean, roomy seats, excellent service from the staff. It was the same as flying a non-discount airline but without the food. The captain even came over a few times to announce places of interest we were flying over, the staff were lovely and it was a great flight overall.

### “service is awful”
Worst airline I ever flew, service is awful. Crew are so not nice. Airplanes are old and not maintained. Didn’t fly on time with lots of delays and also they change the time of the flight.

### "never book them again"
Horrible company, never book them. They delayed our flight from Tel Aviv to Prague twice at the last minute, including 5 hours delay after the group was already at the airport. The same happened on the way back, from Prague to Tel Aviv with three last minuted delays, which made the group spend 7 wasted hours at the airport instead of continuing traveling in the beautiful Prague. The company did not take any responsibility, did not open the check in early, did not even addressed the customers with any explanation. Horrible experience, will never book them again. They did not take any responsibility, did not open the check in

### “there was no reply from them”
We were meant to take a one way cruise from Israel to Barcelona, and fly back with Bluebird. The cruise was cancelled due to the war, and we had to cancel our flight as well. Bluebird offered us a credit to use in the future, which was certainly better than nothing at all, and told us to use the reservation number to redeem the credit. However when we decided to redeem it, we found no way of using it in the new reservation, and no matter how many messages we sent them, there was no reply from them, so now we see no way of redeeming this credit.

### "they offer no meals whatsoever"
Not Verified |   I flew with Bluebird airways last week. There was an one hour delay, which is typical for low class airlines. The flight is old and they offer no meals whatsoever. I cannot say it's a bad airline . They hardly answer emails.

### "the worst airline ever"
Bluebird Airways is the worst airline ever! They weigh every single piece of luggage and item you carry on or check in, making the entire process incredibly frustrating. They cancel flights without notifying their passengers properly, leaving you stranded and confused. Their system and website are a complete disaster – canceled flights still show as confirmed and on time. When you finally reach the airport, you discover the flight is canceled. They claim to send messages to your phone number, but not even an email is sent. Do they think they're my boyfriend, sending texts to my phone? This airline is a complete joke. Avoid at all costs!

### "Wouldn't recommend it to anyone"
Awful. The crew is rude and have a tendency not to be of use nor help, barely English speakers the stewardess said "no sir, in our planes the seats don't recline" with a smugness on her face that was just disrespectful. But worry not, for the aircraft itself is a disgrace. Photos attached. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and it was a mistake I will not make twice. Sincerely rather stay at home.

### "Very bad onboard service"
Not Verified |  3 hours delay. Worst boarding, worst service. Very bad airplane with horrible seats. No online check in. No notification about delay. No compensation. Very bad onboard service. Worst flight of my life

### “Very unpleasant behaviour”
Flight was cancelled, which is ok if you got a refund. Month and a half have passed and I still see no money coming. What is the most unpleasant - I can not find any phone number of support to discuss the issue. I filled in form on their internet site but have not got any reply. Very unpleasant behaviour for a business entity.

### “the worst airline experience”
Definitely the worst airline experience I have ever had. It’s my first and definitely the last flight I will have with them. Changed flight time after booking putting us two hours later and the cabin baggage regulations are different than the European standards.

### "a very pleasant experience"
My family and I traveled from Athens to Prague and back and it was a very pleasant experience. It's what you'd expect from a low cost airline and the people at the check in desks (both from Athens and Prague airport) offered to check in our cabin bags at no cost so we don't carry them around. The crew was nice and the planes were in good condition. No cancellations, no delays and no hidden fees (for us at least, idk if we were lucky).

### "a lot of cancellations"
Lucky if you fly with them, have a lot of cancellations of flights and a lot of delays. Plane was clean but old and you could see her age. Crew was nice and helpful; there were announcements of the path of the flight. In flight service was minimal.

### "worst service from an airline"
They don't have online check in. This means that you need to be at the company's ticket control 3 hours before your flight. As I did. I had to wait an hour and a half until my turn came, because two people were trying to serve two flights (all passengers need to go through the control). When I checked in my hand luggage, they asked me if I had paid for it, when I answered in the negative, they informed me that the charge, regardless of kilos, is €70 - the truth is that it was 9.8 kilos (2.8 kilos over the allowed limit). Despite my dissatisfaction, with the 1.5 hour wait to be served and for the extra charge of €70, while I paid the price, they did not allow me to take the suitcase with me in the cabin, which means extra inconvenience while waiting to receive it from my destination airport. By far the worst service from an airline. Since I didn't know her as a company, I booked a flight with her. The lesson of all history is to buy a ticket only from companies you know, regardless of price.

### "These guys are my heroes"
These guys are my heroes! My flight out of Tel Aviv kept getting cancelled due to security issues. I was stranded in Israel. But this little airline kept flying people out. They flew us out when it was war. God bless this airline for its courage and service to us stranded Americans.

### “Bluebird kept flying”
Not Verified | Bluebird seems to get a lot of grief for its punctuality. But I give it 5 stars for a simple reason. When BA and Virgin and so many others decided that as passenger safety was their priority they were going to run away and leave everyone in Tel Aviv, Bluebird kept flying. My favourite airline.

### "This not service"
This so called low cost airline is all about scamming people and getting more money on the size and weight of the bags we bring on the plane. This not service, it's a cat and mouse game where the blue bird employees have a poor attitude.

### "no response is just plain rude"
Not Verified |  Changed time and carrier arbitrarily and brought flight forward 2 hours. My connecting ferry was canceled due to bad weather. I was not really expecting a refund but no response is just plain rude. 5kg carry on is ridiculous.

### "worst company I have ever flown"
The worst company I have ever flown. They delayed my flight 7 hours. I lost 1 day in a booked hotel, which cost me 200$. Additionally to this they charged for a small personal bag - 450 shekels. They have very draconian system, when they check weight of all your personal items together. And if they more than 5 kg, then you pay fine in the airport. My luggage was exactly 5kg. Additionally i had a laptop and a small bag. They charged for this 450 shekels. By flying with blue bird airlines I lost 320$. Customer service of this company is extremely rude.

### "don't recommend to anyone"
Not Verified |  The worst airline I have used. The moved the flight earlier for 3 hours. Called me in the middle of the night if i can come earlier. Then the flight was delayed for 1 hour. Total mess and don't recommend to anyone.

### "Worst airline I tried"
Worst airline I tried. Delays of 6 hours+. They gave food in the airport for the delay after people have started making a fuss about it. They delayed the flight every hour by another hour not letting anyone know about the actual delay in advance, even though there was only one plane available for this flight that was known would take at least 4 hours to do a round trip to come back and pick us up.

### "Decidedly the worst airline"
Decidedly the worst airline. No contact phone number as the one provided is disconnected. Emails go unanswered. Purchased "cancellation" insurance from the airline, which promised a refund. When the refund was requested, the airline simply went dark. A follow-up email a day later was responded to claiming the refund eligibility period expired the prior day. Further emails seeking clarification on why the original refund request was no honored continue to be ignored by the airline. Recommend avoiding any travel with this airline, and in particular paying for the cancellation insurance as it appears to be a complete scam. At this point I regret not reading reviews on this shady outfit prior to purchasing as others have experienced similar disappointment.

### "Seats extremely narrow and uncomfortable"
Not Verified |  1) Seats didn't recline. 2) No video screens or entertainment. 3) Water must be purchased. 4) 100% full. No room to budge. 5) Seats extremely narrow and uncomfortable. 6) Aged plane.

### "charged full price without refunds"
The worst airline we have flown on in every way. Old and nasty planes Stewardesses are nervous and knock you with your luggage. Unlike other companies, they approve loading a trolley with the regular card, but limit it to 5 kilos. Not only is their luggage limit the lowest they also stand by every passenger not to be one gram more. That's why there is also a long, never-ending line of people moving things from suitcase to suitcase and throwing clothes in the trash. The whole exercise is to charge 70 euros for one suitcase in one direction! We arrived at check-in an hour before the flight. They closed the check in and there was not one representative in the area to answer. They just let us miss the flight that left anyway in 40 minutes late. Of course they charged full price without refunds even though we booked a flight through them for the next day.

### "cabin was so dirty"
One of two airlines that fly from Tel Aviv to Prague (direct). Would recommend choosing any other airline even if it’s with two connecting flights. Check in was in person with no option to do online. The line was more than an hour long and did not look like they made any effort of speeding it up. The crew were ok considering the stress they were under. The price was not good either probably because of the lack of competition, so you get all the features of a low cost airline for a full price. Airplane was old and not well maintained. The cabin was so dirty that I was too grossed out to take the safety guide out.

### "most definitely not recommend them"
Not Verified | Absolutely the worst airline I have experienced. Most definitely not a cheap flight! Paying £322 with no suitcase in off-peak time for just one hour flight most definitely there is no bargain there. You can bring 5kg of free luggage wow thanks! Most cabin luggage these days is at least 3kg per suitcase which only truly gives you about 2/3 kg to play with unless you pay £40 for 20 kg each way. The 40-minute flight from TLV! Absolutely ridiculous not to mention they are not running on time. Will never ever fly with them again and most definitely not recommend them. This company is an absolute joke. My flight was meant to leave at 18:25, 3 days earlier I received a WhatsApp text to inform me that the flight time has been changed and the new flight time is 11:10 am! I replied to the text requesting a bit more info sadly as anticipated no response at all! I cannot make it for 11:10 there is a reason why I chose the later time. Absolutely a joke of a company. I feel so stupid for not reading the reviews before buying the ticket. Certainly, I will never fly with them again never.

### "Horrible experience"
Horrible experience. An outdated airline with no online checkin and very non standard carry limitations of 5 kg per passenger. After hours long waiting to check in due to non professional staff, I had to weigh my small handbag as they try to charge everyone. Seats are dirty and falling apart only held by duck tape. Worst experience I have had with an airline low cost or otherwise

### "did not refund the money back"
They cancelled our flight and we asked for a refund one year ago, it has been a full year and they did not refund our money yet. I wrote several emails and called several times but they keep saying “in process” and did not refund the money back. The worst airlines in the world
