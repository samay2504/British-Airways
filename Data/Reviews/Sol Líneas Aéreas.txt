### Sol Líneas Aéreas customer review
Buenos Aires - Mendoza was delayed 4 hours no explanation. Once we arrived to Rosario the flight was delayed again due to "technical issues". The service in flight - flight attendant was flirting with the pilots in the cockpit she appeared only once to make us the favor to hand out some cookies.
