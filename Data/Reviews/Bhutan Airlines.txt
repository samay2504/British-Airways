### "Worse ground handling staff"
Worse ground handling staff - no system - bad behaviour with kids including pushing them. Changed queue 4 times without any established support or system. Don’t travel if with kids and family

### "bags were a bit extra in weight"
Nice aircraft and good inflight service. Good food and efficient, courteous cabin crew on both sectors. However I had a stressful checkin experience on the return flight (Kolkata to Bangkok). My checkin bag weighed 23 kg, so it was 3 kg extra, which usually is overlooked. However the checkin gentleman wanted to prove his super-efficiency and he asked me to put my hand bag also together with my checkin bag. He then went a step further and forced me to put a paper-bag with food also on the weighing scales. Then he declared that the total weight is 35 kilos, and you're allowed only 20+7 kilos, so you have to pay for the extra 8 kilos. This is ridiculous, in my 30+ years of international travel with premier and budget airlines, nowhere have the checkin bags been weighed together with all hand bags, and even food packets. I was singled out by the staff, I saw that they did not weigh the hand bags for the other passengers with me. True the bags were a bit extra in weight but if they weighed just my hand bag it would be 8 kilos, just a kilo extra, which could be excused. But this extra-zealous guy was out to fleece me. He even made me stand apart and asked me to get rid of the extra weight or pay up. It was so humiliating and stressful. Later I was forced to throw away some rice packets and then they allowed me to checkin. The funny part is that they have no system of pre-purchase baggage like all other airlines, so you're forced to pay the inflated airport rate; that is not fair policy. I had called up their helpline a few weeks before to check for purchase of excess baggage but they refused. I will never fly their airline again, inspite of the fact that the food service and cabin service was good. I have also advised all my friends to avoid this airline.

### "cannot select seat through online check-in"
You cannot select seat through online check-in or manage booking although the option is shown on the website. The flight schedule is not dependable and keeps changing. Cleanliness is an issue and the food is basic.

### "waiting two years for the refund"
Terrible. We are waiting two years for the refund of a Paro-Kathmandu flight purchased in 2020 (flight number: B3771). We could not travel to Bhutan in 2020 and it’s still impossible now to enter in the country (2022). First, they told us that the flight would be valid for another year. But, as in 2021 it was still not possible to travel there, we requested a refund. Since that moment, (more than a year ago), We have sent twenty emails and they do no answer. An incredible behavior of this company to its customers. We are still waiting for an answer. If it happens, we will communicate it. We have sent all the information twenty times to have our legal refund. But They have not answered yet. For the moment, We do not recommend this company to anyone. Be very careful if you buy flight tickets with them.

### "good things to say"
Kolkata to Bangkok. I have nothing but good things to say about Bhutan Airlines. They're a great ambassador for their country, even though I never set foot in Bhutan. I flew from Kolkata to Bangkok on an Airbus 319 in Economy bulkhead. Surprisingly, I had the row to myself. The plane was clean and colorful, decked out in Bhutanese red and gold in the interior, and the crew were in traditional Bhutanese outfits as well. Seats were comfortable, we were on time, and the flight was only about half full. There was a meal on this short hop featuring Bhutanese cuisine and it was truly outstanding--one of the best economy class meals I've had in years. Even the inflight magazine was superb, highlighting not just places to see and things to do in Bhutan, as well as spotlighting some of the more unusual aspects of their culture, such as women taking multiple husbands. Bottom line, it was not just a great transport experience (on time, hassle free) but an educational experience about their home country as well. I can't wait to take them all the way to Bhutan.

### "Bhutan experience turned bad"
Today, I am flying out of Paro via Kolkata to Bangkok with another connecting flight 3 hours after landing with Bhutan airlines. Their flight is delayed by at least two hours without passengers being informed properly. No signboards, no announcements. Also as they know my connecting flight I did not get pro-actively informed. Asking myself and going up to the station manager no real support is offered, no reliable forecast for landing time in Bangkok is given. I have to short term re-book my connecting flight from Bangkok to Singapore. No responsibility taken for extra cost, a hotel in Bangkok or other additional expenses. Their excuse is weather in Kalkuta not allowing their plane to come to Paro. A wonderful Bhutan experience turned bad!

### Bhutan Airlines customer review
Flew Bangkok to Paro round-trip both flights via Calcutta. Outbound I was in Economy Plus and the legroom was excellent. The breakfast was well served hot and tasty-far more substantial that is offered on many other carriers. On the return I was upgraded to business and the leather seat was roomy and comfortable. The meal (lunch) was good but the performance of the crew was truly world-class. I have to say that I was very impressed by the professionalism and demeanour they displayed. In business one is given access to priority clearance in Bangkok which worked well but still a long wait for baggage-though mine was the first bag out. Excellent offering overall.

### Bhutan Airlines customer review
PBH-CCU CCU-PBH Y class. Check in staff at Paro very helpful friendly smiling. Cabin crew similarly accommodating and friendly. Clean cabin decent space for Y class. Light refreshments and sandwiches (veg or non-veg) served on this short 50-minute segment. Every flight has been spot on time (or slightly early). Good announcements from cockpit to point out Himalayan peaks when near Paro. Competitive prices. A good alternative in/out of Bhutan from Drukair.

### Bhutan Airlines customer review
BKK-PBH via CCU. Y class. Wet leased aircraft from Lithuania. Checked in just before closing the counter. Hassle free. On time departure. Full breakfast served on first sector and snake on short second segment. Crew efficient. Fares lower than competitor Druk Air.
