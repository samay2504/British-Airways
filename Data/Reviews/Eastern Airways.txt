### "treated passengers with disdain"
Not Verified |  Aircraft interior was decent, comfortable seats, some good legroom in front row seats. Cabin crew definitely needed a bit of polishing in terms of professionalism and customer service. The purser treated the passengers with disdain and loud conversations between cabin crew and the flight deck about non-related work "banter" gave a bad impression. Pilots were fairly jarring in cabin announcements blaming various other parties for delays, which also felt unprofessional. Shut the flight deck door if you're going to make phone calls about the location of the tug- the passengers don't need to hear.

### “inconsistent service levels”
Used to use this airline for my weekly commute to work. Would only use them in exceptional circumstances now. Good points - the crew are always great and I can say the same about all the ground/gate staff I have come across at both Gatwick and Newquay. Bad points - fares have shot up and remain expensive, no flexibility unless you pay a premium fare, minimal luggage allowance, limited refreshments on board (you can only drink so much tea and eat so much shortbread/cheeselets), inconsistent service levels from customer service team (I call out S**** who was great the few times I needed assistance, other people have been useless) However, their biggest downfall is when things go wrong (which they do all the time with no notice and poor comms) they only pay your EU261 compensation when you make a massive fuss. Happened to me yet again, took 43 days for them to reply to my compensation submission and now say up to 3 months to receive payment. I had already paid out for four trains and a £100 taxi to get me where I needed to get to on time. There are people reviewing on here that they are taking over 6 months to make payment. Similar thing happened on one of the big low cost airlines and compensation was paid within 48 hours. I would only leave such a review having exhausted trying to rationalise with them directly which proved a waste of time. For the Newquay route I would advise to use the other airline that flies to London or even the train. More reliable, less stress.

### “what a shambles”
My wife and I had travelled to the US via Paris CDG taking the Eastern flight from EMA to CDG with an onward flight CDG to SLC on Delta. On the return journey, Eastern just cancelled our flight leaving us stranded in Paris CDG airport and did not answer any emails or book accomodation etc. We had to wait 24 hours for their flight the next day. I am retired but if I wa still working this would have cost me dearly in lost earnings not to mention the inconvenience of finding a hotel most of which were fully booked due to the olympics. I assume it was lack of passengers booking as the flight the next day was less than half full. But what a shambles. I will never fly with them again.

### "They are shockingly poor"
I've been working in Cornwall since April 2023 and shall be until January 2024. Give the distance, frequency of return home and drive time as Eastern flew into Newquay from my local airport, Humberside it seems so logical to use them. Initially not too bad. It seemed there was usually a 15 minute delay on published take off times but this is live withable. There were 4 instances however where flight times were changed at short notice and cancelled the day before. In one case the HUY flight had be be taxied to EMA to catch a flight. Once the seasonal flight stop I flew NQY to LGW. What an absolute nightmare. Planes late leaving meaning onward connections missed, planes breaking down on the apron, everyone disembarking and them getting on to another one. Coming out of LGW, delays being sent to the wrong gate and not being told where to go. This is the only airline I've use where you have flight anxiety as to is it going to take off and if so how late will it be. They are shockingly poor. In the last time I had a flight booked with them from LGW while on the train into London, I checked to see if the flight was on time and it was running 4 hours late. My only alternative was to book a train and caught that, ironically I was in the hotel 3 hours before the flight would have touched down. Will never use them again, would rather walk. The customer services is hit and miss at best, mostly they are rude and full of themselves. Staff on the planes are fine but let down by the company and the reliability and quality of the aircraft. It seems not only were my flight affected but looking at other review site of others comments you get a better picture of just how poor an airline this is.

### "flight was cancelled at the last minute"
My review is very similar to others, if you actually get to fly the onboard service was decent for a short propeller flight. Friendly crew and a drink, snack given. The key is "if" you get to fly, my return flight was cancelled at the last minute and alternative offered was to be squeezed into a taxi with other passengers for 5 plus hours and miss my last train home from Gatwick which would leave me abandoned at Gatwick overnight. Or fly the next day but they won't pay for an overnight hotel in Newquay or any taxi fees or expenses. Wouldn't use them again due to being unreliable and obstructive in handling my compensation claim. Shame the front line staff were good its the behind the scenes staff who are unhelpful. Train for me next time.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Eastern Airways Customer Services does not exist. Wow. Problems with my flight both ways and so rude when I have tried to sort this out. Booked through a third party - "Well you chose to book through a third party". No responsibility for any of the many issues that occurred with the flight, the delays, the service received at both airports - brick wall. Where is the compassion, the understanding, the service to customers - so hostile and unhelpful. I am battling between 3rd party suppliers and Eastern Airways with inadequate support from Eastern Airways. Avoid at all costs. Two planes faulty, (one passenger could not re embark due to the frightening experience) lack of communication, travelling with children and left on the tarmac in cold and rain - wow. Not the airlines fault apparently. Such poor service and support.

### "the experience exceeded my expectations"
I recently had the pleasure of flying with Eastern Airways from East Midlands, and I must say that the experience exceeded my expectations in terms of genuine warmth, friendliness, and personability. Right from the moment I stepped foot on the aircraft, I was greeted by a genuinely friendly crew who exuded a warm and welcoming. Throughout the flight, the crew members went above and beyond to ensure the comfort and satisfaction of the passengers. What truly set this flight apart was the crew's personable approach. They took the time to interact with passengers on a personal level, engaging in friendly conversations and offering helpful recommendations. It felt more like flying with a group of friends rather than being mere passengers. This personal touch made the journey feel special and created a pleasant and memorable experience. In conclusion, my experience with Eastern Airways was characterized by a genuine, friendly crew who made the flight enjoyable from start to finish. Their warm and personable approach created a positive atmosphere and left a lasting impression. I would highly recommend Eastern Airways to anyone seeking a memorable and pleasant flying experience.

### "They did not disappoint"
My wife, daughter and I used Eastern Airways to fly from Humberside Airport in the UK to Esbjerg in Denmark. We had a number of reasons for choosing Eastern: The proximity, as Humberside is only a 10 minute drive away; and our daughter has a disability that requires her to have lots of medical equipment with her in the cabin; she requires mechanical ventilation, via a trachea when flying and it was our daughters first flight. We believed Eastern as a small local airline could provide the service we would need to make the trip a success. They did not disappoint. From my initial communication with customer services, to our 2 flights, all the staff were helpful, considerate and went above and beyond. Nothing was too much trouble and they pulled out all the stops to ensure the medical equipment could be accommodated. At one point the captain of the plane enquired with the air steward about our daughter’s welfare. Very impressed and would not hesitate to use the airline again. We have told friends and family about the route offered by Eastern and recommended them for a break to Denmark. Cannot praise the airline enough and special mention to customer services, the staff and the captain who was on both journeys.

### "she was more interested in speaking than offering me some help"
Not Verified |  After both flights were cancelled we were made to rearrange other flights, upon trying to claim the cancelled flights back through the 3rd party (Opodo) they said that there is no evidence that the flights were cancelled. I called Eastern Airways for one thing, an email from them confirming that the flights were indeed cancelled so that I could forward that to the 3rd party and progress with the refund process. At this point I, unfortunately, met with a customer service representative, it was pretty clear from the get-go she was more interested in speaking than offering me some help. I appreciated that this booking was made through a 3rd party but I just needed clarity. After repeating herself over and over telling me it basically wasn't her problem, to the point where her tone was something I wouldn't expect from anyone within a customer service environment, rude, abrupt and a complete disregard for the situation. I suggested that she is obviously is working from home because she would never speak to a customer like this in front of other colleagues she then said "No I'm in an office and you are on loudspeaker" and then got her colleagues to confirm that I was on loudspeaker by shouting from across the room that they could hear me. This bothers me for a few reasons, 1) the amount of effort that was taken not to help me could simply have been applied to sending an email and I would have come away from that phone call being a happy customer. 2) When I called I was greeted with a message informing me that there is a high wait time, however, Eastern Airways can afford to have 3 employees listening to a phone call. I am assuming that customers were waiting in a queue whilst these customer service representatives sat around and listened to the representative telling me should wouldn't help me for 15 mins. 3) What on earth am I doing on loudspeaker anyway? I hope that the phone calls are recorded so that this can be looked into, I will be sending an email to customer services and let them know of what just happened. I hope that her manager was not one of the ones that shouted across the room confirming that they could hear me.

### "disappointed in the customer service"
I am very disappointed in the customer service I received. I expected a bit more flexibility to change my ticket considering the new and immediately imposed government lockdown rules in the north of England. I am angry that I can’t visit my family, and that’s not the airlines fault but I would think they would want to treat their customers well to encourage flying as I would think that some airlines are probably struggling at the moment. Keep the £60 but lose a customer for life. Shame as quite decent flight routes in the UK and checked in bag included in ticket price which most budget airlines charge for. Will be using EasyJet and LoganAir for internal UK flights from now. Regret booking and will always recommend against using Eastern airways.

### "this Mickey Mouse airline"
Aberdeen to Humberside via Durham Tees. Once again I have been let down by this Mickey Mouse airline. They are the biggest burglars charging 1st class rate for what I wouldn't even call a second class service. An example £480.00 return from Humberside to Aberdeen you can fly New York at that rate. Been delayed over 2hrs this week 2hrs last week due to "technical issues" real reason is they are cramming all on the last flight due to lack of demand. Bring on Logan Air, give them a run for their money and get them closed down.

### "denied a place on the plane"
Southampton to Leeds. Eastern Airways bumped me off my flight to Leeds and I missed my son’s graduation as a result. For professional reasons, the only travel option available to me was an 08.35 flight from Southampton to Leeds  which would just get me there in time, and a 14.00 return flight the same day. I booked the flight in good faith several weeks in advance to ensure I had a seat. At the Gate I was denied boarding as the plane “was overweight” and 2 passengers would have to be left behind. Despite remonstrating forcefully and explaining why it was so important to get to Leeds on that flight, Eastern Airways could not be moved. Eventually, the airport staff (whose behaviour was at all times sympathetic and polite) asked the other passengers who were waiting on the transit bus for a volunteer to give up their place, explaining the circumstances. Unfortunately, no one took pity on my plight and I was denied a place on the plane. I was left distraught and upset having missed an unrepeatable family event. No compensation was offered by the airline, and there has been no attempt to contact me to offer either an explanation or apology. Yet another instance of the airlines overbooking flights, but this time with a human cost.

### "airline is shockingly disappointing"
Booked a return from Leeds to Aberdeen at considerable cost. The outward leg was delayed as flight crew could not be found and operational issues being quoted yet again by the helpful ground crew. On my return again advised that Leeds Flight is cancelled and now flying to Humberside due to operational reasons. Humberside flight delayed by 2 hours. Taxi offered from Humberside to Leeds as is the norm with Eastern. Once again flights cancelled to save fuel costs and everybody stuffed into one aircraft then bussed like cattle to Leeds. Never using this airline again and now decided to drive and use a hotel. This airline is shockingly disappointing in the manner it cancels it late night flight to double up and save cost. Why offer the route if tou have no intention of honouring it.

### "most impressed by the service on this flight"
Flew Eastern Airways from Newcastle to Aberdeen. I was most impressed by the service on this flight - a complimentary drink & snack was a very nice gesture. The flight was very smooth even though there was bad weather in Aberdeen! The air stewardess was very polite & professional & could not do enough for her customers. I would recommend this airline and use it again if the need arose.

### "total disregard for customers"
Aberdeen to Leeds. Once again a flight cancellation of the evening flight due operational reasons. Only 3 passengers on flight so cancelled and flown to Newcastle and taxi to Leeds. A new operator on this route is desperately needed to get rid of the cowboy style of Eastern and their total disregard for their customers. I fly this route every month and without fail there is a delay or cancellation on this route. While the ground crew are getting peppered with questions and the frustration of passengers obvious they try to maintain the calm while the top management laugh at the savings in fuel costs and boosting profits. Shame on you for such a poor service, if there was a hot air balloon service to Leeds I would take it rather than fly with this sub standard airline.1

### "service is now virtually useless"
Flew Wick to Aberdeen with Eastern Airways. This service is now virtually useless and constantly late. Today almost 3 hours late and we're still not off the ground yet. 6 colleagues waiting for me to arrive in Aberdeen and another load of passengers stranded in Wick having missed business and holiday connections.

### "service worse than ever"
Prices going up, service worse than ever. Now £450+ Aberdeen to Humberside, noisy, slow old planes and constant "operational delays". We could cope with the 1990s aircraft when they were on time but this airline is now a joke. Nearly half of my flights to various destinations have been delayed this year, two over 3 hours. Bumping up prices paid for by the energy sector won't keep them going forever. They were handy but expensive, sadly now best avoided.

### "poor communications"
Generally, I'm full of praise for this airline but a number of tech faults on the Saab 2000's recently (including right now as I'm stranded at Leeds Bradford) has slightly shaken my belief in this company. Poor communications, apparently reducing reliability, lack of punctuality, no staff available at LBA, etc etc, what should be a fast twice-weekly commute has become very hit and miss. Most distressing was calling Eastern two weeks ago, knowing that LBA was closed due to snow only to be told that their flight was departing on time! Not clever. I didn't even bother to go to the airport, preferring instead a 5hr drive. They've got to try harder to keep business customers like me, on planes that are generally lightly loaded we are the only ones providing regular revenue. Feeling unloved currently.

### "would happily recommend"
Southampton to Leeds Bradford with Eastern Airways, and found the flight pleasant. Boarding quick and cabin crew seemed friendly enough. The flight was a little pricey, but then all internal flights are. Aircraft (Saab 2000) was in good shape, but you could tell it's age judging by the decor of the cabin, but seats were quite comfortable. Was a bit annoying as on the return flight, my seat reclined when I leaned back without me pressing the button. Overall a good flight and would happily recommend to anyone.

### "no staff available"
Humberside to Aberdeen with Eastern Airways, and the first time I have flown from Humberside and it will be the last. Arrived at the airport two hours before departure to check in for my flight only to find that Eastern Airways had no staff available on the check in or on the customer service desk. Contacted them by phone and was told that no one would be available until an hour before flight departure. Great customer service.

### "mattered as a customer"
First time I have used Eastern Airways so wasn't quite sure what to expect however I was very pleasantly surprised at the experience. The price was £98 return Leeds/Bradford to Southampton. This is about £40 more than the cost of driving. It would also take 10 hrs in total driving (especially through roadworks on the M1). The flights were both on time and took less than the scheduled 65 mins. Check in staff very efficient, including fast-track through security (nice touch). Price also included a 15kg suitcase. Complimentary mints handed out at take off and landing, also offered complimentary drinks and crisps during flight. When was that last offered on a domestic flight on budget airlines? The plane as an older turboprop plane but clean and comfortable with lots of legroom. I will certainly use again and thanks to all the staff for restoring my faith in air travel as we all know how tedious it can get. I actually felt I mattered as a customer for once. Well done guys.

### "very cramped and noisy"
I have to fly with Eastern Airways when traveling to and from work so I fly with them at least twice a month from Scatsta to Aberdeen. I have never known a flight to either land or depart on time, they always have delays on this route and its very time consuming. The planes we use are very cramped and noisy. If i didnt have to fly with this company for work I would not bother to fly with them again.

### "will not be using again"
I have been using Eastern Airways for about a year now, traveling between Humberside and Aberdeen for Business. I started to notice that when I booked some flights it would say only 4 seats left and I would have to pay the middle tier over £200 one way! It was always the case I got on the flight to find that there would be about 11 people on there and plenty of empty seats, what extra did I get for the higher price - nothing, same seat as the £165 one, nothing different. After spending a lot of money with this airline, I now travel on train to another airport and I can get 2 flights, 2 trains for less then the lowest fare available with Eastern Airways, even flying across the sea I can get cheaper then a domestic flight. Trouble is some people are stuck and have to use the local airport, but if the prices do not start to come down, they will end up pushing everyone to other airports and little airports like Humberside will end up closing. It's just greed, if other airlines can fly at £60 a seat for a domestic flight, then why cant they? I will not be using again.

### "found the flight comfortable"
Flew Newcastle to Birmingham with Eastern Airways for the first time today, and found the flight comfortable and flight attendant polite, courteous and professional. The plane was loud but that's to be expected for a small plane. I would definitely recommend and fly again with them.

### Eastern Airways customer review
I have used Eastern Airways for a number of years as my commute to work in the offshore industry. They have always been expensive and have the monopoly on this route. I note when another carrier recently went into completion with them for the Aberdeen route from Leeds Bradford their prices dropped dramatically. I used to book the zonal route pass which bought 6 return flights with full flexibility for around £1700. For my last 6 return flights I booked the 13.10 to DTV. Eastern Airways after accepting my booking and payment cancelled 4 of them on the return portion for operational reasons which were half term holidays and such like. I had to take a later flight which got me to my destination later than had I used the train at a significantly lower cost. The last two flights from DTV to Aberdeen were late and cancelled also. Technical problems sometimes occur and have to be accepted but it seems much more common lately. This airline is unreliable and accepts bookings offering flexibility and then removes the flexibility. I note another offshore workers review states that nobody within the industry has a good word for them and I agree with his statement. A budget airline experience at premium prices. I am now travelling by train

### Eastern Airways customer review
Surprisingly good. First time with Eastern. Good check-in at NWI airport, quite efficient and speedy (except for the Norwich airport surprise tax) Boarding on time, nice friendly greeting on board. Good seating (1x2) - I chose the single seat. Good legroom, surprising good all round seat, quite impressive for a small airline. Inflight good, nice coffee and biscuits. A sandwich would have been nice but it was only a short flight. Cabin crew good and attentive. Good communications from cockpit and cabin crew. On time departure and early arrival. Nice to see a crew route around bumpy weather. Good all round experience.

### Eastern Airways customer review
Due to a family bereavement I had the need to make a day round trip from Leeds to Southampton. Two options were available to me train or fly down. Despite not having flown for 25 years I chose the fly option based on cost and obviously journey time. What an excellent choice I made: I booked with Eastern Airways and had an extremely pleasant trip. Check in was efficient the flight crew were attentive offering light refreshments and warm towels on both legs and both flights were on time despite some very inclement weather on the approach to Leeds/Bradford. The aircraft was a Jetstream and although quite small I found it to be clean comfortable and surprisingly quiet for a turbo-prop. I have no hesitation in recommending Eastern and would use them again. The experience restored my confidence in flying!

### Eastern Airways customer review
Tuesday 7th Aberdeen-Newcastle. Service is terrible. I fly Aberdeen to Newcastle and know many who travel the same route through working in the offshore industry nobody has a good word to say. Prices are a fortune and customer service doesn't exist. I believe Aberdeen got voted the worst city in 2014 and when you deal with the staff at Eastern in the airport you can see why. Lazy and no sense of helping a paying customer a £211 one way flight paying customer. Sorry to tar all of the staff with the same brush as I'm sure there are good ones in there i just haven't met them in the last 9 years of using Eastern. I thought Bristows would improve things but nearly a year past and still the same dire service. Needs must though i'm afraid so until the day comes when Flybe or someone takes over then I'm stuck with Eastern.

### Eastern Airways customer review
Just flew in this evening from Aberdeen to Southampton via a short (25 minute) stop-over at Leeds-Bradford. Very short queue for check-in was followed by fast-track through security and then a very pleasant 45 minute wait in the Eastern Airways lounge before boarding. Aircraft was a comfortable clean fast and relatively quiet Embraer ERJ135. Very pleasant and hardworking stewardess went out of her way to ensure passengers were safe and comfortable. Complimentary drink and snack on both (short) legs and warm flannel were most unexpected and in stark contrast to other economy airlines. Flybe's service on this route is very much the poor relation.

### Eastern Airways customer review
Flew from Newcastle to Cardiff on the 6th November 2014. Arrived at the airport in good time to be told that the 0.640 flight to Cardiff was being combined with the 07.40 flight to Birmingham. This was due to that only 7 people were due to fly on the Cardiff flight and it wasn't economically viable to run the flight. Got bounced to the 07.40 flight to Birmingham which eventually arrived in Cardiff just under 2 hours late. Poor show planes are shabby seats are hard and the cost is astronomical. If your final destination is not near Cardiff consider alternative options. My journeys end was in Bath and it took just as long what with getting the bus from the airport to the railway station and then the train journey than by either train all the way or by driving. Will not be using Eastern again.

### Eastern Airways customer review
Birmingham to Newcastle 23rd May. Lightly loaded (just me and another passenger). Greeted by pilot onto plane and given comprehensive brief. Shown to seat by hostess who was very professional served complimentary drinks and snacks when airborne. Seat comfortable flight smooth despite inclement weather on time and bade farewell at the exit by co-pilot. All for about same price as a single train ticket. So very happy to recommend based on my experience.

### Eastern Airways customer review
Fly Aberdeen to Norwich and back. Customer service is very poor they are not helpful. The seat's are worn and hard. Crew don't care for the passenger's. I will be flying BMI from now on about the same price but far better service.

### Eastern Airways customer review
Started flying regularly from SOU-LBA following FlyBe's withdrawal of the route. Never thought I would say it but bring back Flybe! The timetable appears to just be general guidance and not something they worry about too much fares are extortionate can't take hand baggage on board planes shabby and noisy. Have given up and started to use the train.

### Eastern Airways customer review
Durham Tees Valley to Aberdeen and return leg.££450 return - overpriced. Seats: old uncomfortable and worn out. Free booze and a bag of crisps and a tracker bar - really nutritious! Cabin crew: rude and stressed!

### Eastern Airways customer review
First class service on the Cardiff to Newcastle route. On time staff were friendly and helpful in which was a very professional service. Would recommend.

### Eastern Airways customer review
Norwich-Aberdeen and Aberdeen-Norwich route. Absolutely atrocious service late departures cancelled flights at the last moment and worse of all no customer care in fact you are treated with competent. What a breath of fresh air it is when you use BMI better service better inflight foods.

### Eastern Airways customer review
Two words unreliable and expensive. Travelling on the 17.35 Aberdeen to Leeds flights consistently get delays. The Aberdeen Eastern Lounge is just a chatter of moans about the standard of service on all routes. If it wasn't for the fact Eastern are the only carrier out of Leeds to Aberdeen they would lose to competition! If you are wanting an on time flight don't rely on Eastern!

### Eastern Airways customer review
Regular Newcastle to Aberdeen flyer weekly price is sky high and service is flaky at best regular tech issues cancelations etc. When you complain you get the standard reply if you don't like it use another carrier! They know they are the only ones with the route. On the one occasion I missed my flight (Aberdeen traffic) cost me another £205 to get home so total flight cost - £350. Flights to USA are less. ABZ to LDN £80. Need some competition on this route.

### Eastern Airways customer review
I booked Eastern for the Aberdeen to Leeds flights on a regular basis last year. The fleet at the time included Dash 8s as well as the Saab 2000 Jetstream and Embraer types and I still use them now for their Bristol connections. Complimentary service on-board (including wines and spirits on evening flights!) friendly cabin crew and (generally) very punctual timings. You do pay a premium but then anyone who's ever experienced a LowCo at their worst will be glad to part with the extra to avoid that experience. Mainly used by business people I feel - the free copy of the Spectator was an added bonus as were the boarding/landing sweets and hot towels. A throw back to the old days perhaps? A consistently good value and high class full fare product.

### Eastern Airways customer review
Punctual generally reliable and a good selection of routes around the UK. Fares are extortionate planes very uncomfortable and noisy. Cabin staff tend to be rude and abrupt. They need to remember we are paying customers and deserve a little courtesy not just being barked at in a bad tempered way. A bit of customer service training wouldn't go a miss.

### Eastern Airways customer review
Booked a return flight from Aberdeen to Leeds/Bradford which was cancelled approx 2 hours before departure which meant spending the night in Aberdeen in order to fly direct the next morning at 09.25 although Eastern airways did offer the opportunity to fly via the Midlands with a coach journey from there to Leeds/Bradford. This alternative flight was subsequently delayed until 12.15 and passengers for Leeds/Bradford were then told that due to 'technical problems' we would be flying to Humberside and would be transported to Leeds/Bradford by bus. On arrival at Humberside 6 of us were put in a taxi and the driver said the journey would take approximately 2 hours. On arrival at Leeds/Bradford the driver stopped at the barriers saying that he did not wish to enter the car park because he would have to pay. I spent more time on the road than I did on the plane. The return flight thankfully was without incident. The cost of the journey was almost £300 return but cost me far more in delays and cancellation. I will never travel with Eastern Airways again!

### Eastern Airways customer review
Flew Aberdeen to Teeside on several occasions. Service was good but no more than you would expect. I have flown to Orlando for less than they charge for a return flight to Aberdeen. I work with people who get return flights from Aberdeen to Manchester for 1/3 of the cost that Eastern charge from Aberdeen to Teesside. How do they get away with this.

### Eastern Airways customer review
I fly to the oil rigs all the time and I've never had such a poor and frustrating service. Eastern airways are consistently late and they never tell you. I really hope another airline comes to Aberdeen to provide a professional service the price Eastern Airways charge they should be embarrassed of they service.

### Eastern Airways customer review
Newcastle - Cardiff same day return. Flights left on time and arrived early both ways. Only around 9 passengers outbound but a full flight on return. Crew were very good as is always the case with Eastern. Fast-track security at Newcastle is a welcome bonus! You only get what you pay for!

### Eastern Airways customer review
Newcastle to Cardiff return. Once we arrived at Newcastle it was simple and easy to check-in Eastern Airways passengers are able to use the fast-track security lane at Newcastle. Boarding the aircraft was quick and easy partly due to the aircraft only been a small Jetstream 41. The aircraft was clean and tidy all hand baggage was loaded into the hold and coats hung up in a wardrobe at the front of the aircraft due to the limited space. I arrived in Cardiff and was through the airport in less than 10 mins. Eastern are efficient and well organized. The return flight was just the same however the aircraft was delayed 30 mins due to high winds. I will be definitely flying them again in the future!

### Eastern Airways customer review
Humberside-Aberdeen return. Flights on time although hand baggage limitations were strictly adhered to because of the size of the aircraft. Service great throughout. Small Jetstream turboprop better to get a seat on the left if it's full. On the return Eastern Airways have a dedicated security channel in Aberdeen and a small lounge which has a few snacks and drinks. Onboard was limited to two alcoholic beverages per person.

### Eastern Airways customer review
Flew Leeds to Newquay via Bristol. At check-in we were told to stay on the plane at Bristol. Talking to a passenger during the flight he said the flight was going from Bristol to Southampton. The flight attendant confirmed this and seemed to have no idea we (and others for Newquay) were on the flight. At Bristol she told us to get off where we found they were arranging a bus to take us to Newquay. Return from Newquay 4 days later - our luggage was put on our flight we were just about to board when the flight was cancelled although nothing was wrong with the plane. Luggage was taken off and for 3 hours we were given conflicting information about what was to happen. Departure times were given and then altered and ultimately another aircraft arrived from Birmingham and we got to Leeds 4 hrs 25 mins late. I flew rather than drove at significant extra expense to save hassle and time.

### Eastern Airways customer review
Newcastle-Birmingham. Flew out and back on a Saab 41 Turbo Prop with 29 seats. There was surprisingly a lot of leg room which was welcome. One member of cabin crew was very efficient and the captain kept us up to date when we encountered a 20 min delay. On the short flight we were served complimentary drinks and snacks. Very good professional airline.

### Eastern Airways customer review
Newcastle-Bergen (return) - On the way out we travelled on the Saab Aircraft the bigger of the two turbo props. Flight was fine only one cabin staff nice flight we took off earlier than expected and landed early too. On our return we travelled on the smaller of the two turbo props much smaller than the one we travelled out on but again only one member of staff in the cabin. On both flights We were offered sweets just before take off and then complementary drinks during the flight. I would certainly recommend flying with Eastern Airways.

### Eastern Airways customer review
Eastern used to be a small punctual good airline with ok planes great staff and excellent service that flew point to point for a lot of money. Since their takeover of SouthWest they have managed to become a bigger delay-bound second-rate airline with bumbling buses for aircraft that fly through places you don't want to get off at for a lot of money. Even their staff say openly how low they have stooped. It's a shame that Eastern have given up. No more sloe gin Spectators or quite good G&T's.

### Eastern Airways customer review
Birmingham to Newcastle returned. Both flights very pleasant friendly cabin crew who were polite. Free drinks on board including alcohol and a pack of crisps. Would fly Eastern Airways again unfortunately they don't fly to very many destinations. Only negative is flights are quite expensive.

### Eastern Airways customer review
Southampton-Durham Tees Valley. Check in speedy and departure on time. Fantastic cabin crew and smooth flight arrived early. I'd recommend Eastern to anyone.

### Eastern Airways customer review
Newcastle to Bergen return: We were flying on the smaller of their two aircraft and there were a total of four passengers plus one flight attendant. All four passengers were seated in the very rear of the plane most likely to balance the weight due to the small aircraft. The good thing about flying with Eastern was that probably it was included in the cost of the tickets but passengers are allowed to go through the Fast Track security line. Also at Newcastle International terminal gate 31 is exclusive for Eastern. The terminal lounge was tiny and had bowls of sweets and copies of their inflight magazine. The downside is that the aircraft is very noisy so one has a problem hearing the inflight announcements and the aircraft seems to feel turbulence being so tiny. Also if you need to use the toilet try not to otherwise it's located in the rear of the plane behind a door that you need to be sure is securely locked or you risk giving a show. I could not for anything find a sink but there was a bottle of hand sanitizer that was available. The flight from Bergen there was no dedicated terminal lounge. The so-called complimentary refreshments on both flights were only drinks and either a packet of sweet or savoury snacks. The flight from Bergen the flight attendant offered hot towels just prior to landing. This wasn't offered on the flight from Newcastle. The flights were over an hour each and I think they could and should have served sandwiches considering they advertise how they are a cut above the other airlines. Perhaps it's due to mounting costs but other than those tiny packets of snacks they bombarded us with sweets before and during the flights. The sweets are not the best quality too. Return flight had a total of twelve passengers and one flight attendant. As stated in earlier reviews it seems as though Eastern doesn't have a huge customer base so I'm not sure how they manage to exist.

Leeds-Bradford to Southampton plane was about half-full which seems fairly typical from the other reviews. Price was higher than Flybe but my employer paid . Everyone else also looked to be travelling on business - ie. no-one else would have been paying the fare themselves either. I suspect Eastern should be OK with the financial numbers if they can charge high amounts and half-fill the plane - this would be equivalent to quite a high loading (80%?) at Flybe prices. Flight itself was good helpful stewardess a very professional outfit. Excellent that they offer free Fast-Track at LBA - ideal for an early morning flight. Speaking of which they fly to Southampton earlier in the morning than Flybe which again is useful. It's also a really handy route Leeds to the south coast.

Have flown with Eastern several times now and found everybody friendly and helpful. At last an airline that cares about you - useful when a connection is missed owing to fog delays! It may cost a little more (although no hidden add-ons so not a lot of difference) but far better than the cattle trucks.

Southampton-Liverpool Saab 2000 very good product. The price you see is the price you pay no hidden charges. My concern is low passenger numbers this my third flight with Eastern all have been well below 50%.

Flew with Eastern NCL-SVG as they offered more suitable schedule over Widerøe who I would normally fly with. Tiny J41 with 18 passengers for the 1h30 flight. Hand baggage had to be surrendered at aircraft steps as limited space onboard (bag was laptop bag size) so keep hand baggage to a minimum if you really want it in the cabin. 2 cups of tea shortbread hot towel and sweets before take-off and landing all complimentary made such a difference to the flight. Flight attended very friendly and welcoming and flight deck kept you well updated on arrival time and weather. Would fly Eastern again however price can be very steep so book as soon as you know the dates of your holiday - it pays off to book early!

Have flown Eastern quite a few occasions now and always found them informative efficient and friendly. Prices are a bit high although I travel on business and do not pay myself.

SOU-NCL return. More expensive than Flybe but much better product. My concern is only 6 pax up 9 back on Jetstream 41might have been slack day but these load factors cannot be profitable. Hope they continue as all routes been competition.

Just booked a flight to Los Angeles return cheaper than an Aberdeen-Humberside return - which is now close to £400. Still only half filling the plane and a huge customer base of offshore workers waiting for them to lower the price.

IOM-NCLNCL-ABZ. Great little airline very personal service form the point of check-in to inflight service. Both flights only half full so made the experience very pleasant. Extremely efficient and takes the edge in levels of service.

First time on Eastern - Stansted to Manchester return. Excellent aircraft and service however only four passengers on board going up and twelve coming back in a 29 seater. Reason I suspect is cost - could have flown to Dubai and back cheaper. I hope they survive as they are something different but Eastern must look at their pricing structure.

IOM-BHX return. Comfortable for a small plane punctual friendly. And cheap: or at least as cheap as Flybe for the same route (taking into account the extra charges I would have paid to Flybe). At Birmingham the Eastern boarding card allowed me access to the fast-track security queue (not that it helped) and a business lounge. The flight back arrived 15 minutes early and from leaving my seat on the plane to leaving the airport was an amazing 5 minutes (including collecting baggage from the carousel).

Southampton To Angers return. On time attentive staff champagne nice snacks totally perfect. I notice some people complaining about the prices? In my opinion the price reflects the service and represents excellent value for money. I hope they continue with these lesser used routes.

I've previously flown with Eastern Airways between MAN-INV / LBA-INV but low cost airline FlyBE forced them to quit these routes earlier this year. Eastern Airways maybe a little pricey but professional excellent service and friendly staff makes up for it. I welcome Eastern Airways' return on these routes!

### Eastern Airways customer review
I fly periodically with Eastern and agree with earlier comments about the friendliness and helpfulness of cabin staff. However their charges are pretty high and although they are cheaper on routes they compete with flybe on they are always more expensive. That is fine but I recently had to fly back from NCL to SOU and got to the airport much earlier than expected. Eastern showed no flexibility re: changing my ticket and demanded I purchase a new ticket. Fair enough so I asked for the taxes and charges to be transferred to the new ticket. Not only was this refused but the ticket agent was adamant that the taxes are not fundable. They cannot have it both ways - charge full service prices and behave like a low cost. Ironically if I was flying low cost such as Easyjet I could have done this for about £30 but with Eastern wanted closer to £150! It is hard to swallow when I am regularly paying £240 return for a domestic round trip. That degree of inflexibility is going to force me back onto Flybe.

Leeds Bradford to Southampton with Eastern Airways. Efficient friendly check in at LBA swift boarding and an on-time departure. Clean smart aircraft although I wouldn't like to do a longer trip on the J41! Informative captain friendly professional cabin crew. Offered drinks including champagne and snacks which was fine for the short flight. Arrived at SOU 10 minutes ahead of schedule. Very impressed with this airline and would use them again on this route.

Checked in by friendly and helpful girl at Leeds/Bradford. Straight through Fastrack. Eleven passengers in Jetstream so plenty of room. Flight attendant was friendly and welcoming. Drinks/snacks. Chatty captain. Landing at Southampton bng on time. Despite the extra cost (probably less if I didn't have to book the day before because of family bereavement) I will choose them if possible next time I fly. Before this flight I had never heard of them !

CWL-NCL easy check in lounge very good took a couple of minutes from lounge to seat on aircraft. One cabin attendant fantastic service including complimentary drinks snacks sweets and hot towels on a 1 hour flight on 29 seater aircraft. Baggage reclaim at NCL took just a couple of minutes.
