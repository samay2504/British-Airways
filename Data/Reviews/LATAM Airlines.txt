### "love the attentiveness of the crew"
This was a domestic leg between Bogota and Medellin. cabin crew switched me to the first row since this plane only had 2 rows of premium class and I was scheduled to fly in row three. Prior to take off the lead crew member came by welcomed me by name offered a water bottle and wished me a happy birthday somehow they knew. On this very short 40 minute flight we were offered a small snack. A mini sub sandwich, Heineken beer, bag of chips. I love the attentiveness of the crew had and it’s one of the reasons I only fly LATAM within Colombia.

### "asked for Priority boarding"
Not Verified | Online Check-in Process did not work. Kiosks at the Lima Airport did not work. Offered upgrade to Business class for a few but then denied because we purchased our tickets through Delta. Wife has Parkinsons so I asked for Priority boarding and was told to sit down - I got up when I saw a line forming and asked the same lady who then told me to get on line. Then the conducted priority boarding while they were letting everyone else on.

### "really behind the times"
I booked my flight months in advance and paid for seat assignments. I selected seats at the front of the plane, but during check-in, seats were automatically re-assigned to the back of the plane, last row to be exact. Why pay for seats then? The instructions were also unclear and boarding was confusing. Overall, LATAM is really behind the times.

### "refund process is frustrating"
LATAM Airlines Australia is misleading customers about flight ticket prices. Although I was on their Australian webpage, prices are listed in American dollars. When I called to request a refund, they seemed to anticipate my questions and had excuses ready before I even began asking. The refund process is frustrating; they only initiate it after you reply to their email with personal information that they don’t actually need. This seems unnecessary, but they say it’s in case the credit card refund doesn’t go through. If they followed the proper procedures, the refund could have been back in my credit card account within days.

### “Incredibly unhelpful staff”
Not Verified | I paid £84 for a hold bag online the day before my flight. On arrival at the airport, LATAM said there was an error with their system and the payment wasn't linked to my ticket. I showed them my invoice, receipt email and bank transaction and they agreed the payment had been made, but said I needed to pay £131, and the £84 would be refunded. I made the point that there was no reason for me to pay £50 more because their system had failed, but they wouldn't budge and as I was at risk of missing my flight, I ended up paying. Had a very frustrating experience with their complaints team, who also accepted the issue was with their system, but said system failures happen and that I was liable for the full amount. So essentially, LATAM are rewarded for making a hash of a luggage booking and charging over 50% extra at the airport. Incredibly unhelpful staff at all levels. Scam artists. Enjoy my £131. I'll spend a lot more to avoid you in future.

### “it was a very slow process”
Not Verified | I needed to reschedule my flight and repay for it. The website has a system for rescheduling but it kept rejecting my credit cards. This was not an issue with my cards as I tried 4 different ones, and have a good credit history! Eventually found a phone number to be used for rescheduling, but it was a very slow process and extremely expensive (much more than the website promised). I spent a total of 5 hours on this task thanks to the inadequacies of Latam.

### "there was zero assistance"
Not Verified |  My travel partner was in a wheelchair which was registered ahead of the flight. We had no problem with American Airline getting there with this issue. We took LATAM on the return trip from IQQ to SCL. They didn't have enough staff so persuaded us to walk to the gate, as they said it was a small airport. The LATAM representative at IQQ said that we were already registered as disabled, that SCL was larger and we would be met there with a wheelchair. There were 3 people disembarking flight 602 in SCL with disabilities and there was zero assistance. For some of the people SCL was their final stop so they were able to wait. We had a short time to make our connection, a wheelchair never arrived and we could not get assistance. We barely made it to the next gate for departure to LAX. It was a very negative experience.

### "experiences with LATAM went so well"
In a month traveling around South America, I flew Latam Chile 6 times, on the following routes: RT SCL-PMC; OW PUQ-SCL; RT SCL-IPC; and OW SCL-MVD. I may be extremely lucky, but all these flights were on time, safe, very comfortable, and served decent food and drink options. On the 4 flights on which I checked luggage, it arrived within minutes on the carousel. On my last flight to Montevideo, a crewmember approached me and my wife by pronouncing our names in order to serve snacks and drinks to us! I am very happy that my first  experiences with LATAM went so well, and based on these experiences, I can recommend this company without reservations. Thank you very much! One thing they definitely should improve is to provide free wifi to all customers. I know that is still not a practice worldwide, but it really should be.

### "the experience was terrible"
I flew LATAM (Flight LA8020 from MDZ to GRU) as part of a connecting ticket with Swiss, and the experience was terrible. Although my Swiss ticket clearly included checked baggage, LATAM refused to honor it at MDZ. They claimed the baggage allowance only applied if I were flying directly with Swiss. Despite explaining that on my outbound trip I had no issues (because I boarded with Swiss), LATAM still made me pay an extra fee on the return segment. To make matters worse, LATAM issued only my first boarding pass (MDZ to GRU), insisting they are “not Swiss.” Because of this, I had to exit the terminal in each connecting airport, go through passport control, check in again at the counter, and clear security once more just to get my next boarding pass. It’s astonishing that they sell the entire connection together yet don’t consider baggage allowances, won’t print all boarding passes, and completely ignore any Swiss frequent flyer privileges. Seat selection was another frustration: unless you pay extra, you’re stuck in the middle seat. LATAM’s customer service was unhelpful, dismissive, and showed no willingness to coordinate with Swiss or resolve these issues. If you’re flying on a Swiss ticket that includes segments with LATAM, be prepared for hidden charges, wasted time, and zero accountability.

### "I have not received a response"
Cargo is more important to passengers on a missed connection who were then sent to a hotel 120 km away at 1:30 am I was one of about 15 people flying from Iguassu who missed a connecting flight at 23:30 to London at Sao Paolo airport on 6/11/2024. After queuing at a LATAM desk for about 1 hour at 1:30 am I was given a hotel room in Taubaté, 120 km from the Airport, a journey of 1.5 hours by taxi. I was told that food would be given to me when I arrived. There was no food. I had to book a taxi back to the airport the next day with a voucher. I spent $20 on tips. I had to ask for a voucher for food at the airport. The plane to London the next night was held on the tarmac for at least 1 hour while cargo was loaded. Why could LATAM not have held the plane for an hour the night before to get 15 people on board the flight they were booked on? Why is cargo more important than passengers. I complained to LATAM and now, nearly 2 months later, I have not received a response from the airline.

### "never fly with them again"
We downloaded the LATAM App and followed instructions. Husband checked it many times and it said gate would be announced at 11 am, so we waited to know where to go. At 11:10 husband went and checked the board as app still hadn't said which gate to go to. The board said final call! We had to run like hell and everyone was in a crowd and the staff were panicking - will never fly with them again.

### "gate for the flight is already closed"
Horrible experience! Slow, unwilling & incompetent staff. We (5 people) arrived almost 2h before the flight & spent 45min in queue just to be told that the gate for the flight is already closed -  it was still 55min to the flight time and there were 2 separate flights in one queue. LATAM manager said that their staff were walking around saying the flight number, but we did not hear them, no proper communication such as asking where are you flying to. The LATAM manager told us to call to Peru, instead of sorting the issue on the spot. After almost an hour on the phone with LATAM in Peru, they disconnected the call without advising the price for the next flight. Peru staff member only said that the next flight is tomorrow and that we have to pay the full price!

### "frustration and disappointment"
I had luggage checked from Jacksonville Florida all the way to Manaus Brazil. The flights were purchased through Delta operated by LATAM MIA-GRU and GRU-MAO. At GRU baggage claim, I was told by LATAM that Delta had not transferred luggage to LATAM in Miami- but they would send all the way to Manaus and deliver to me on the next possible flight. This was on December 23. Since then, I have not been contacted by LATAM. I have contacted both airlines and understand it is LATAM responsibility. LATAMs lost baggage service tells me every day that my luggage has arrived at airport but cannot tell me when it will be delivered. I have noticed this is a standard message sent every time I inquire. I find this misleading. LATAM refuses to provide contact information for their airport staff in Manaus, who they say are the only ones who actually know the status. Meanwhile, I am in Manaus, without my clothes, sporting equipment, Christmas gifts for family among other inconveniences. The misdirection and impossibility of communication created by the LATAM services which are designed to create an image of rapid resolution have instead created unimaginable frustration and disappointment.

### "found the customer service exceptional"
I flew from Auckland to Sydney and found the customer service exceptional, from check-in to the crew on the flight. However, on the return trip, our flight from Sydney to Auckland was canceled while we were at the boarding gate. We were confused about what we were supposed to do. We followed the flight attendants, retrieved our baggage, and waited in line to be rebooked on another flight. Even though it felt uneasy wondering if we would ever get another flight, we eventually got transferred to Air New Zealand flight on the same day. I am appreciative of the crew who worked hard to find us another flight.

### "luggage took 12 days to arrive"
Not Verified |  I had a lost luggage that took 12 days to arrive on my final destination. The lack of communication and attention to the customer was the worst experience I have had in quite while. No responses for my emails, no phone calls, I had to call every day to try to get some information about the missing luggage and some sort of compensation and even though a case id was opened for receiving some compensation I have received the message that since I have received my luggage that I would not receive any help.

### “Crew was friendly and professional”
Best Airline of South America. From SCL-IPC in economy class and on returned I received paid upgrade. Both classes were great. Both flights were on B787 and were on time. Cabin was clean and perfect condition. Crew was friendly and professional, on the Business Class was fabulous. Business class was great even though was domestic having amenities, warm towel, full lunch service. They did not offer welcome drink and midflight snack. Food was tasty with selection of 4 wines. IFE was great with variety of movies. Best airline in South America.

### "been a horrible experience"
Not Verified | Today we went to Cusco airport to board a flight to Lima to connect to Juliaca. We came early and were the told that our flight was delayed because of “air traffic” issues— what resulted then was complete chaos. The flight was delayed from 9:40 am to 10:40 am but did not leave till 11:20. On our boarding we were told our boarding passes were invalid. How does an airline give a passenger an invalid boarding pass ? The attendant then proceeded to make changes in the computer to give an updated pass— the computer system was clearly outdated. She kept doing the same thing over and over again — when I asked her what she was doing she responded in a rude and short answer. We finally got our boarding passes the stewardesses there was no room for our carry ons— we found room but then the stewardess took our bag and removed the walking sticks my dad had in the carry on. They took my dad’s walking sticks. We ended up of course missing our connecting flight to juliaca. We were given another flight the next day (they did give a hotel voucher *). However when we asked for our bags— we were made to wait 3.5 hours to get our baggage back. The explanation was that they had to register each bag one by one. The inefficiency of this airline is so apparent ! I asked to speak to a manager several times throughout the process and no one came. While waiting there were cargo boys waiting doing nothing the whole time we were told that they didn’t have staff handy to deal with this. The excuses were endless.  it’s really far way”. The staff isn’t there. They have to register the bags one by one.  I decided to call customer service about another flight in a few days to Lima to then catch a flight to the USA. I asked if I could change my flight given the events of today and I was told that I still had to pay 96$ per person. I asked them if they could waive this fee— it should be free! No answer. When I asked about talking to a manager— there was no way of doing this. This has been a horrible experience. We have spent the whole day in the airport without a place to sit or drink a beverage while waiting in Lima airport. I cannot recommend this airline.

### "avoid this airline"
Our Saturday flight from Lima to Peru, they half the plane, stopped boarding, and we sat on the plane for like 30 minutes before we were told to deplane because of tech problem. Ok, sure. We wait another hour in the terminal then they said it's cancelled, rescheduled for tomorrow Sunday. But here's the actual service problem: Everyone then rushed the desk, and we as business passengers were given no priority at all. My friend and I stood in "line" (they didn't bother enforcing any so people just cut in front to talk to the agent) for a while before we tried to get help from another gate agent. None of the other gates' agents could help. We eventually returned to find that they had led the other passengers back to immigration arrivals. We were just told to "wait" for another hour with no instructions, and nobody spoke decent English, and every time I tried to communicate in very basic Spanish, I just get shut down and told again to "wait here". Between the horrible lack of attention & service and immigration hassle, in total we spent a whole 8 hours at the airport Saturday dealing with this. After going back through immigration into the country, I spoke with the Premium check-in desk, and he could not rebook us on an earlier flight--only the rescheduled one going out Sunday. That agent then gives us a voucher for what was a subpar hotel 45 minutes back in the city. I asked if we can stay across the airport at the close-by hotel or any better hotels, and I was refused. The hotel they gave us was very basic. In fact, for dinner, they served a plate of plain spaghetti with a tiny bit of meat sauce. My friend cannot eat beef or pork, and they had no other options for him. We ended up having to go outside to eat, else we starved. Afterwards, I tried to claim compensation for the lost in time, hotel at destination, and food, and got nothing. This airline shows that they are not competent and gives no regard to their customers, even premium cabin. I very strongly recommend to avoid this airline if at all possible!

### "Customer service is unhelpful"
Customer service is unhelpful and the airport crew in Lima does not want to help me and provide inaccurate information. I was trying to board my flight from LIM to ATL, they made me get off while boarding, although I made my flight, because their system said their own flight was delayed. My bag was on my original flight to LIM to ATL. To help, they gave me a free hotel stay and taxi ride to the airport for the day and told me to come back the following day for my flight. The new flight I got was for the same day - so I didn’t even use what they provided and if I had, I would have been stuck in LIM for another day. I was afraid the entire time and refused to leave the airport for safety. The crew wanted me to leave the airport and instructed me to do so, which would have resulted in missing my flight.

### "A disgrace of an airline"
A disgrace of an airline. Initial flight was cancelled due to weather at final Destination. There was very limited help with booking an alternative flight and Latam made no Effort to run additional capacity on the route to cover the flights cancelled. As such we managed to secure a flight over 48hours later, albeit via a other airport en route. We were expected to pay for the additional hotel costs loss. Of transfer costs and excursions we could no longer do. After many requests to the airline for Compensation they maintain their response which is essentially we do Not care This is your problem. I would advise against any travel with this airline. On a Positive note the crew on the flight when it finally turned up were great.

### "customer service is really bad"
Not Verified | Never ever go with the LATAM Airlines. The customer service is really bad. They don't even help you to buy the baggage. Even I submit the case, they close the case without giving me an answer. Never ever book the ticket.

### "seat was broken on a 5 hour flight"
My seat was broken on a 5 hour flight, the seat cushion faulty and I was forced to sit there in pain because there was no empty seat on the plane. We even paid extra to sit together with my partner. So what did I get when I complained? No compensation for you, you flew there so why are you complaining?” Horrible customer service, and the food is  unacceptable on any level. They used a white oily cheese paper bag for distributing cakes.

### "US$200 for an extra bag"
I was charged US $200 (the equivalent in Colombian pesos) at the ticket counter for checking an additional luggage piece, which weight less than 50 pounds. When traveling from Salt Lake City to Bogota, American airlines charged me US 100 for the same extra piece of baggage, which seemed also excessive. What could I do? Throw away my bag at the airport? US$200 for an extra bag.

### "cured me of flying LATAM"
Not Verified |   The air crew were just mediocre. On check in I obtained my boarding pass without a hitch. Relaxing in the lounge and the flight is delayed 2 hours. Looking for LATAM ground staff to speak to were non existent. When the gate was allocated i went to the gate for info, only to get apologies and little more than an offer of food that was not suitable for my dietary needs. The round trip of Lima Cuso Lima has cured me of flying LATAM who I have been flying for over 10 years along with the thing that they call a website that is the worst of all airlines. The wallet is nothing more than a scam.

### "exceptional friendly crew"
Short domestic hop and for merely 18 € upgraded myself into economy plus. First row, middle seat free and exceptional friendly crew calling me every time by name and letting me feel welcome. Not much of a difference with the catering as in regular economy and no access to any lounge, but seating conditions and priority boarding was very welcome.

### LATAM Airlines customer review
Whatever is being said, LATAM is consistent. There are no surprises with the cabin service, crew is friendly, planes are in good shape and pilots know what turbulence they fly in. Everything was uneventful today, but with the difference I felt to be a valued customer. A small snack, coffee and soft drinks were available, absolutely ok when flying economy (especially comparing it to what other airlines offer).

### "did a great job helping us"
Not Verified |   My aunt was in this flight and she is an elderly person with special needs. She was assisted and helped by Santiago a LATAM representative. He was very gentle and professional he did a great job helping us.

### “has all the hallmarks of a scam”
LATAM is perpetrating something that has all the hallmarks of a scam. Last month, after teaching in Colombia through COVID, our son booked his return to Sydney on LATAM. The party was three: his wife, their one year-old son and he. The route was Bogota to Santiago on one flight and then a second flight Santiago to Sydney. The Santiago to Sydney flight makes a “technical” refuelling stop in Auckland. Strangely, the New Zealand authorities require a transit visa for the Auckland stop. Australians don’t need one. My son’s Colombian wife did. LATAM never told her. Twenty-four hours before their flights were scheduled to leave Bogota, the family sought to check in on-line. They could not check in our daughter-in-law because “there could be outstanding documents”. No details. When, next day, the party sought to check in for the initial Bogota/Santiago flight, LATAM refused to book in our daughter-in-law in as she did not have a transit visa for NZ – which was, after all, on a separate flight. The requirement was news to the family. How long would that take? Perhaps 20 minutes. They figured that if the visa did not come through before the flight to Santiago, it might by the time they reached Santiago. If not, they could stay in Santiago. LATAM refused their request for the family to travel to Santiago - even though no visa of any sort was required for them to do so. These were regular tickets. No discounts involved. The visa for our daughter-in-law did not arrive before the flight to Santiago closed. LATAM documentation shows each member of the family as a “No Show”. This is clearly untrue. Because our son needed to get to Sydney for work, through LATAM they rebooked code-share LATAM/Qantas tickets for flights two days later. The original tickets had cost $5500. LATAM charged an additional $3400, no less. Both the original flights and the rebooked flights had many unfilled seats. LATAM was never going to be out of pocket. This must happen all the time. There may be modest costs involve in re-issuing the tickets – but $3400 extra is ridiculous and usurious. To date LATAM has refused any refund. LATAM’s behaviour has all the hallmarks of a scam.

### "unprofessional business class service"
Most unprofessional business class service by a flight crew ever experienced on an International flight. Overhead bins filled with luggage remained open as the flight prepared for take-off ON an active runway & 1 bag fell out. Pushed the flight attendant call button & asked them to close all the overhead bins for passenger safety, but the flight attendant replied (quote): "This is a passenger responsibility" & she returned to her seat & left the bins open. I & 2 other passengers got up from our seats to close the bins & were admonished by the same flight attendant to "return to your seats". Have never witnessed such absolute & total stupidity by a flight crew. No pre-flight beverages & no pre-dinner beverages & it was 90 minutes into a 5+ hour flight before any flight service was even started. Flight attendants made 1 pass through the business class cabin with a combined dinner & drink service &and did not return for another hour to remove the service items. Call buttons for additional wine were ignored & when 2 passengers went to the galley to request additional water or wine, they were again admonished to "return to your seats". Truly the most disgraceful job by a business class flight crew.

### "she could not accept our dogs"
On April 20 we were supposed to have a flight from Santiago to São Paulo by LATAM, we were three passengers with two small dogs. At the airport check-in counter, the LATAM staff told us that she could not accept our dogs because the dogs in their carriers was a couple of centimeters larger than allowed. Just a few centimeters. The weight of the dogs including the carriers were 7 kg and 5 kg. And most importantly, after Sao Paulo we immediately had a flight to Istanbul and then from Istanbul to St. Petersburg! So we lost all our tickets. We travel with our dogs and always use the same carriers and we have never ever had any problems! But what’s absolutely crazy is that we flew to Santiago a year ago with these same dogs by LATAM. By the way, during the flight the crew was very strict and didn’t even allow me to bend down, stick my hand into the carrier and just pet the dog. when I told the employee that these dogs had already flown with LATAM in the same carrier a year ago, she told me “well, maybe your dogs have grown over the past year.” I said that my dogs are 8 years old, they haven't grown for a long time, and what she said is incredibly stupid! But she didn't care! So I lost all my tickets and had no choice but to look for another airline company and buy new tickets and spend a lot of money again. LATAM didn’t refund a single cent to me! We ended up traveling with Sky Airline, Iberia and Turkish Airlines. If my dogs ​​and their carriers were really big, these companies wouldn't accept my dogs, would they? In the end we were on our way for five days instead of two, the dogs and we were exhausted, I spent about 10 thousand euros on tickets for all of us, plus a lot of money on hotels, taxis and so on.

### "luggage hasn’t gone on the flight"
I am here now at Cartagena airport, it’s 11pm here in Colombia. This whole experience with LATAM makes me know I will never come to this country again. First of all, please be very careful flying domestic airlines in Bogota. They will keep changing the gate number last minute and you will have no idea. In certain areas you can’t hear the speakers. I was supposed to be at gate C2 to Cartagena at 12:34 flight. Because they changed the gate, I was there two hours ahead of time, I missed my flight. I asked them at the counter, they told me I had to go back out and speak to a representative. I went out, this airline is affiliated with Delta. Even though they knew I was a gold Medallion member, they said they couldn’t do anything and I had to go to ticketing. Now, during this time, no one is telling my luggage hasn’t gone on the flight. I speak to the ticketing area, I find out that there are 3 other people who missed their flight because of the gate change. And the ticketing lady says for a 9 pm flight there are seats but I have to pay another $150. I could get a cheaper flight on another airline and she told me to do this. Again, she never tells me my luggage is still in Bogota. I catch a 7:30 flight on Wingo that left an hour late, only to find out when I get to Cartagena that my luggage isn’t here and the 6-7 reps that are at the latam podium state they can’t help me. There is no supervisor to speak to. Finally, by calling delta , I get a working customer service number. I’m still waiting on the line. Alone as a woman, not knowing the language, with no luggage because of this airline. Not knowing what to do. Should I just leave and go back home. Is my luggage still in Bogota. I don’t know what to do.

### "it was a disappointment"
Flew Business with Latam and it was a disappointment. The food is far from being adequate for business class. Wine and beverages of basic quality and food not enough for such a long flight. My seat did not fully stretch, so I could not have adequate rest. The departure was not organized and both flights were late! The pilot did not give any information about the flight and destination. I don´t recommend flying business with Latam.

### "Worst customer service"
Worst customer service of any airline we have flown. 3 of us were booked in business class on a flight from Easter Island (Rapa Nui) to Santiago. The flight ended up delayed by 15 1/2hrs due to a cargo door and engine issue. After an initial delay of 3 1/2 hrs, an announcement was made that the flight was cancelled and all passengers were to go to the check-in to get rebooked. It was utter chaos as we were told every flight for the next 3 days was fully booked and that we were on our own to find accommodation and transportation for an unknown duration on this small isolated island. LATAM refused to be responsible for accommodation because there were "too many passengers for staff to arrange accommodation with the limited accommodations on the island. but the passengers were expected to find accommodation on their own?? An announcement was made stating that we would receive compensation for hotel/food for each passenger and the monies would go directly to our LATAM wallet within 24hrs. With virtually no internet, limited cell service, and zero assistance from staff, we were finally able to secure the last 2 rooms in the hotel we had previously stayed in. We were informed by WhatsApp 7 1/2hrs after our original expected departure that a new flight was scheduled for 05:00 the following morning. When we arrived at 02:30 to check in, the airport was empty of staff but dozens of overtired, stressed passengers were already waiting in line. No one in line had received any compensation from LATAM and several were quite upset. We were assured again by staff that the funds would show up in our LATAM wallet and then we could transfer the funds to our bank accounts to cover costs incurred. No funds were ever issued by LATAM. They left hundreds of passengers stranded with no accommodations, no food and no transportation for what turned out to be over 15hr delay for most passengers, with many other passengers delayed for days as this plane was smaller. When we finally boarded and departed, no food was served and towards the end of the flight, business class passengers were going up one by one asking for food only to be given a single yogurt and a juice. When one passenger asked for coffee, they were told they were "out of coffee" - how was that possible when no drinks or food had even been served during the flight?? When I reached out to LATAM through several different avenues, I was ignored and finally told that we received a voucher at the airport and so our claim for compensation was denied. We never received anything from LATAM nor the LATAM staff at the Rapa Nui airport. LATAM customer service in Santiago Airport was atrocious. After our Easter Island flight delay, we had missed our rebooked connector and when we tried to get the connector changed, we were accused of being at fault for missing our flight and told we would have to pay for a new flight until I pointed out that the 12 people standing behind us were on the same delayed flight. overall in 6 flight segments we flew with LATAM on this trip, only one was on time and boarding was always chaotic. Five of our six flight segments were premium or business and we rarely felt this was much of an upgrade. Save your $$ and book with JetSmart.

### "dysfunctional call centre"
LATAM call centre is dysfunctional. The airport ground service is average. The website and app are not easy to use and show you an error message at the end of booking process. Once in the air, they are fine with OK food and polite crew. As a LATAM black member now with call centre priority but it has always been extremely difficult to deal with the call centre. They are not able to assist anything on the phone but to “create a case” for you to get someone else to deal with the request in a dark box. They can select a seat for you but when you check in, the seat won’t be correct. They are not able to make an award booking using my LATAM point. They will only respond to my request following up “case” status after copying the email to their CEO Office. Now it took them 3 months to tell me my request to make an award booking from SDU to CGH in a simple economy class cannot be completed in a required time frame. What’s the use of LATAM pass program? Completely dysfunctional call centre.

### "made my 15-year-old nephew stay at Lima"
Not Verified |  They made my 15-year-old nephew stay at Lima airport by himself. My nephew spent four months in the United States staying with us. He had a form from his parents allowing him to travel however it had expired before he came home. He flew all the way to Lima, and that's when they wouldn't let him board the plane to go to Arequipa with his sister who is an adult. She was able to board, but they wouldn't let him. They said his parents in Arequipa have to get a new form notarized and hand delivered it to Latam in Lima. Wouldn't accept a fax, and they wouldn't let the parents take it to a Latam counter in Arequipa. Essentially they are forcing him to stay at the Lima airport by himself until his parents are either able to fly to Lima to pick him up, or drive to Lima to pick him up. He is 15 years old. Ridiculous!

### "lot of open seats available"
Not Verified |  I was on a business trip in São Paulo for some work, the flight to São Paulo didn’t let us check-in because they sent us the wrong info, in the Boston logan international airport, there is 5 terminals. A - Delta B - American C - jetBlue E - International Flights. We booked with Delta and they were the ones who sent us the wrong info, they said to go to terminal A, but we meant to go to E and we missed our flight. We flew first class and because of LATAM, we had to pay extra unlike other airlines like Delta, United, and others. but we still got to são paulo. on the flight back, we apparently got overbooked, which we had to wait a whole day for. When we got the seating, it was all scrambled and a minor can’t stay apart from adults. They said, “there’s no more seating on the plane”. which was a lie, there were a lot of open seats available.

### "Completely disjointed and disorganized"
Completely disjointed and disorganized ticketing/reservation system. We called their customer service so many times before our flight to make sure things were set after literally several reschedulings of our flights in the months leading up to our trip and we ultimately chose new flights for our itinerary. This caused so many issues with reticketing in their system that we did not find out about until our return trip. We couldn’t check-in, we couldn’t purchase bags online, and they completely messed up the final connection from LAX to SFO. For whatever reason, none of the flight agents at the check-in counters or customer service could find our LAX-SFO leg in the system even though we have the electronic tickets issued with numbers as well as receipts for the whole itinerary. As a result, they could only check our bags through to LAX and not SFO. We ended up spending over an hour during each layover and connection with check-in assistance or the customer service counter, even though our connections were short. Created a lot of stress around whether our bags would make it at all and if we would even make the next flight because the check-in agents were having trouble. On the final leg with Delta (codeshared with LATAM) I was stopped during boarding because my ticket was reissued sometime during the layover and became invalid. When the gate agent tried to pull my name up, she couldn’t find my ticket anymore. It was absolutely bizarre because my husband’s ticket was scanned with no issue. Took over 20 minutes of waiting and hand wringing and calls by the gate agent to fix the ticketing issue so I could get on the plane. LATAM’s system for handling ticketing is god-awful and the whole triaging process by their customer service is so slow and unhelpful. The Santiago International customer service desk spent most of their time trying to fix their backpack and clicked around looking confused for a solid 45 minutes before saying anything to us about what was happening. She asked us why WE canceled our LAX-SFO flight, which threw us into a panic because we obviously had done nothing of the sort and were desperately trying to get our tickets for the flight printed. We did our best to use Google Translate and speak in our (broken) Spanish but it would’ve been helpful if the agents could communicate at least a BIT in English. After another 20 minutes of silence from the agent clicking around, she finally told us to go to the check-in assistance counter before they closed because our flight was boarding in 30 minutes. Absolutely absurd — no help at all and she should’ve directed us there from the start. Additionally, it seems to be a known issue among the agents and based on customer reviews that the online system for pre purchasing checked bags does NOT work. But they seem to just accept it so you’re forced to pay the premium at the airport rather than honoring the online price. Food was absolutely awful on all the flights and they didn’t even offer snacks during the long-haul, international flights. Delta staff for our Delta connections were fantastic, on the other hand. Super helpful with getting our prepaid checked bag and ticketing issues sorted.

### "Fly with anyone else"
Fly with anyone else if you can! Paid extra for premium Economy. The seats were dirty from the previous journey and the in flight service never happened due to the fasten seat belt sign staying on for the entire journey despite no turbulence. It seems this was done so the the crew could stand around socialising at the front of the plane eating and drinking from the trolley intended for us. They had a great time with no work to do on a nice smooth flight. Complaint raised with the airline who dismissed the issues raised really rather rudely. Seems it's a good business idea to charge for a service that you don't actually have to provide, ice profits in a business model like this.

### "impressed throughout by this airline"
This was just one of several flights I took with LATAM, travelling between Peru, Chile and Argentina. Every flight left on time and arrived early. Check-in was always efficient and swift. And cabin crew were friendly and introduced themselves by name (think that’s a Premium thing). The LATAM lounge in Santiago is very good, with plenty of seating, nice food and beverages. I was impressed throughout by this airline.

### "most things were wonderful"
Several small issues. First was a last minute equipment change which if I had known about I would’ve chosen a different seat. Second, the lie flat bed itself is not comfortable for side sleeping as the feet go under the seat in front. That said, most things were wonderful, especially the warm attentive crew. The flight was punctual and I felt well cared for. The IFE is ok and the food is ok, not great but fine. Really see no reason not to choose them again.

### “aircrew are always amazing”
Not Verified |  In flight experience was and is always fabulous, crew are friendly, generous and always with a smile, Cannot fault the crews. It is pretty much the only reason I continue to fly this airline. BUT THAT IS WHERE IT STOPS. The ground staff are swissport they are generally ok checkin too is ok. The website is a total failure, has to be the worst of all airlines it confusing, its paucity is a blight on the idiots who designed it. The Latam pass too is nothing but a rip off, sure they need to get back on their feet but the price gouging is truly shocking. Short trips are ok, inside south America is ripoff. Next they will charge for using the toilet. I despise this airline as a company, but the aircrew are always amazing.

### "Horrible experience"
Horrible experience, when my fiance and I arrived in Lima our luggage stayed in Chicago (where they already sold us a ticket with only 50 minutes transfer) even though we had to go from Terminal 1 to 5, which was two opposites of the Chicago airport. With no warning that this time was not enough to get on time into the airplane. For our luck my fiance could run and arrive there while the gates were closing and tell a lady that his fiancee (me) was coming and could not run any faster as I have asthma. It took only one day to get my luggage to Lima. However, they did not deliver it even though they said they would. So, my fiance and I had to go to the airport where it took around 3 hours to find my luggage as they also lost it inside the airport. When I asked for compensation for the inconvenience plus the costs of clothes and other things, they would only offer me US$94. Even though, that does not even start paying for the inconvenience and the amount of things I had to pay due to not having a luggage. I will never fly with them again.

### "suitcase has scratches"
I bought a new suitcase for this trip and they returned it to me in terrible conditionsm. The suitcase has scratches, dents in the corners, and the wheels are malfunctioning. On the trip to Miami, they had not given me my suitcase when I arrived from the flight, they delivered it to me days later. On the return trip they delivered me in terrible condition.

### “We lost our flight”
LATAM Airlines made us wait an hour so they could get stairs or a connecting tunnel to get us out of the airplane. We lost our flight. Then told us that we could not board our plane because last call had ended. But airplane left way after they didn’t let us in. Told us our checked bag was removed from airplane. Had to wait in line for 2 hours so they could tell me they lied to me. My bag made it to NY, but I didn’t. Then did not print the ticket for milt flight to Atlanta to go to NY.

### “Staff very friendly”
Both flights on time, due to very efficient boarding procedures. First leg on a brand new A320 Neo, Unfortunately the snacks that were served were unhealthy (full of sugar and fat). Staff very friendly.

### "not worth the money it charges"
Applying different prices depending on the country, for the same flight and at the same time, seems like a scam. Boarding is usually chaotic, with 7 different groups. Planes start being old and have very limited legroom. As many other airlines, basic faire comes without a carry-on, which means that prices are +50 USD. Surely not the worst airline, but not worth the money it charges.

### “Very cheap flight”
Very cheap flight, much cheaper than supposed low cost airlines, i.e; Azul or GOL. Smooth checkin and boarding. Luggage was very quickly delivered. Aircraft looked old from outside, but inside had been nicely refurbished.

### “no one takes responsibility”
I am a Latam Pass customer, I have traveled several times with Latam. I never needed any support. The first time I need to talk to them because I am traveling with a pet, and they took me for a fool. Between December 27 and 29, I called several times to reserve the space for the pet that would travel in the cabin with me. They told me to first talk to the connection and then call to arrange the space on the Latam flights. After arranging with Delta, Latam tells me that since it is a connecting flight, they cannot add the service on their own flights! They made me waste time, played with the illusion of a 10-year-old boy, were totally insensitive and wanted to make me pay a fortune to change the flight that they themselves want to force me to change!! It is a madness and a disrespect. Never again. They tell me "but it's in the terms and conditions.” A real nonsense and no one takes responsibility.

### "never fly with this airline again"
We attempted to check in multiple times on line 24 hrs before our flight at different times throughout the day and were not successful, ultimately the site said to check in at the counter at the airport. I thought nothing of it and got to the airport the next day. My ticket did not include baggage and I was aware that I would have to pay for these separately as was the case on the first leg of my trip. When I got to the ticket counter to pay for the baggage fees i was shocked to find out that the price at the airport was $426 CAD higher than what it would have been if i had been able to check in online. Not only was the price a shock but the customer service representative was rude and antagonistic, smirking every other second as if she was happy to see how much more money we had to pay to take our bags. This definitely feels like a scam by LATAM airlines to charge ridiculous baggage fees, we end it up paying $696 CAD for 3 bags or $232 CAD per bag. Beware of this scam, I will never fly with this airline again.

### "I was refused by customer service"
I have never experienced so much unprofessional behaviour. Had a flight from Sao Paolo to Madrid and they cancelled it at 2 AM right at the boarding. People went mad because they didn't offer any other information. People that were shouting and aggressive - they got the hotel and transport and the rest that were waiting until 5.30 am at desk with 1 desk officer without food and water got nothing except food coupons. The flight was rescheduled to 5 pm next day. Desk officer gave me food coupons and told me that I can book hotel and taxi by myself, just that I need receipts for refund. After submitting 2 cases I was refused by customer service.

### “Bottom line is, flyers beware”
Latam Airlines does not have good English speaking staff. Because of that, they are not able to understand what we are saying very well in the US. They also don't have a good online booking process. Here are all my issues with LATAM: 1. I paid for baggage fees in both directions for my flight. The reservation site has a single check for baggage fee. Naturally, I assume that it pays for both directions 2. I called to change my return flight. I specifically asked the agent to confirm that the baggage fees for the return would be transferred to the modified return flight, and the agent confirmed that it is indeed paid for both directions. I think this is probably where the trouble started. My assumptions is that when it is not a round trip, they probably charge extra baggage fee, but they are not clearly calling this out. 3. Everything went fine until I tried to get on my return flight. They told me my return baggage fees is not paid. I had to pay a very high baggage fees, which is nearly double the normal fee if I had paid upfront. Even if the reservation agent had understood me well, and informed me that I had not paid for the second segment when I made the reservation change, I would have taken care of it before getting to the airport. 4. I created a "case" on their support site to get this resolved. I explained the entire story and even uploaded the tickets, and the confirmation of the reservation change etc. After one day, I simply got an email from an agent called Alexander Vélez, saying that the baggage was only paid in one direction; and the case was simply closed! I did not even have a chance to discuss this further with an agent, or agree with the decision. 5. I called back to talk to an agent. The first agent I talked to said "Please wait till I look into the issue". Then, after 40 minutes of hold, the phone simply went dead!! 6. I called back again and talked to another agent called Angela. Her English was very "superficial", and she did not understand what I was saying, and she simply kept repeating the same thing over and over again, without understanding what I was trying to say. Towards the end, I asked her if I could talk to a supervisor or manager, and she said she was not able to transfer me! Bottom line is, flyers beware! Customer service is bad; English language knowledge by all agents is pretty bad.

### "lack of interest to care for customers"
I arrived to the flight and there was no kit with pillow, blanket and airphone. When I asked the flight attendant, she said there should be one in my seat and this was the only one I could have. I told her there wasn't any and she said she would try to find one for me, but she never return to say anything and whenever I would try to call the cabin crew, the light would just turn off without anyone coming to see me. It was a 12 hour flight overnight and the aircon was high, I spent all night without a single blanket and when I left the plane I saw that there were at least 3 or 4 kits on top where the bags were in the first seats. Which means there was an extreme lack of interest on the crew to care for the customers.

### "Will never fly with them again"
Check-in baggage was damaged badly and cracked open. Staff only offered $90 USD as compensation. That also took a long time for them to respond to any emails or calls. Will never fly with them again.

### "Will not fly them again"
Not Verified |  Chaotic boarding; 40 minute delay while in cabin for an 1h20 flight from São Paulo to Iguazu Falls. Will not fly them again and would recommend a different airline.

### “Treat your customers with respect”
Do not fly this airline, if you have the choice. The fact that this airline (like many) have started charging people extra for carry-on bags is disgraceful. Virtually every traveller brings a carry-on with them and imposing a last minute charge on customers is absolutely unprofessional and cheap - especially when the bag amounts to half the ticket cost. As a boycott, I will be writing a 1-Star review every time I fly with this airline and they pull this nonsense. Treat your customers with respect, if you value their business. Period.

### "said this document is not valid"
I bought a flight through kiwi from Foz de Iguazu to Warsaw as final destination. On the 10/12 I was at the airport in Foz de Iguazu, and we boarded on time. Around 22.00 I woke up and a couple sitting next to me mentioned we are landing as an emergency in Rio de Janeiro, I was shocked and thought they were joking. And they repeat they have to change due to weather conditions. We are on our way to Rio de Janeiro, from that moment I knew this would be a hell of a journey. We landed in Rio de Janeiro and the crew said they have to change because by law they have completed the time established at work. First thing, passengers don't need to leave the plane because the change of crew is coming, and we will fly back to São Paulo. We waited in the plane for one hour, after that around 23:30 we have to get out and wait without knowing how long we would be waiting. I decided during that time to speak to one of the staff from LATAM, and mentioned I have a flight to London at 23:45, obviously I missed this flight and I will need to know what would happen next. The staff said don't worry, we will wait a few hours here and once we get to São Paulo you should request a new flight to reach your final destination. Around 02:00 AM we boarded again the flight and flew to São Paulo arriving at 03:43 AM, I go to the LATAM office, explained what happened and showed my boarding pass. Staff said you should go to the office on ground floor, they will reissue a new boarding pass for you. The queue of people that missed their flight was incredibly long, I wait in the queue for 3.5hs until the previous staff told me wrong that queue was only for domestic flights. I need to go to a different terminal. At that moment it was already 16hs at the airport. Once again to the LATAM office, and request for the boarding pass to London, they told me they would check with British Airways if they have a seat for me. They confirm I will be able to flight they booked me the new flight and I asked, yes that's okay but I do have another connection missed due to the delay of LATAM. My final destination is Warsaw, not London. Staff said I will give you a document to request to the other airline to give you a new flight. Another lie from the staff of LATAM. I decided to believe in her word. Waited for my flight until 16:00 Already 24hs at the airport. When I land in London I go straight to LOT office, I showed the document, and they said this document is not valid without boarding pass. For my surprise the useless document they gave me it was not valid without a boarding pass. I asked then, what should I do? I'm very sorry, but you could contact either LATAM or buy a new flight ticket.

### "Choose any other airline"
Not Verified |  My flight was delayed which caused me to miss my connecting flight. All they were able to do for me was book me a flight 13 hours later and a voucher for a breakfast for two. (Me and my traveling partner) Which was only good for 4 croissants and two coffees, (a 5$ cost) which neither of us drink. Beware of this company. Choose any other airline if possible for your trip.

### "Minimal catering with tiny sandwich"
Luckily seated at emergency exit. Minimal catering with tiny sandwich, some cake and a mini twix. One round of drinks with it and then the crew disappeared for the long remaining part of the flight. Did not expect much, but found it curious no one came by with some water, at least after three/four hours. However, all in all better then what other airlines offer in tourist class, so I won’t complain.

### "very friendly and attentive crew"
Long 5+ hr flight in their premium economy, which can be compared to business class seating with European airlines on flights within Europe and to/from Northern Africa or Near East. However seat pitch very reasonable and charging stations at each seat. Furthermore good entertainment system on own iPad or phone through onboard WiFi. Catering acceptable, though not top, very friendly and attentive crew. Nice little amenity kit.

### "Avoid them like a plague"
My husband and I were returning to California from our trip to Joao Pessoa, Brazil, with our toddler son. When we approached the gate, the attendant refused to issue us the proper tag for our stroller, stating that we should just place it in our overhead compartment. When we walked up to the airplane door, we were approached by another employee of the airline, who said that we can't bring the stroller with us into the aircraft, and promised to issue an appropriate tag once she took the stroller off our hands. I felt suspicious when she came back with the white tag instead of the pink one. It wasn't until later we realized that she issued a wrong tag and sent our stroller straight to our final destination - San Francisco. When we landed in Sao Paulo for our layover, we were waiting for our stroller to be returned to us at the gate, but it never arrived. The staff was unhelpful, stating that they didn't have it and didn't know where to look for it either. They refused to call anywhere to make inquiries on our behalf. They simply turned their backs to us and walked away. They treated us like we were some sort of nuisance that they wanted out of their space as quickly as possible. We were exhausted, confused, and frustrated. We were forced to rush into the baggage claim with a sleeping toddler in our arms in the middle of the night, and our hands full with our carry-on bags. When we finally reached the baggage conveyor, the attendant stated that we had a wrong tag and our stroller was sent directly to San Francisco. Who in the world sends a motion-assistance device all the way to the final destination?? I purchased the stroller for this airplane trip specifically, so that our toddler son can get some rest in the airport in-between the 4(!) flights that we had to take to return home, but the stroller was just taken away from us by a person who doesn't know how to handle them correctly. This is the same as making a disabled person run around the airport trying to locate their wheelchair and subsequently being told they can't have it until they complete their journey. I was shocked and appalled by how our family was treated by the airline. When we reached the LATAM check-in counter in São Paulo airport, the employee on duty confirmed what we suspected: we have been misled by the airline workers. The employees we spoke to prior to this moment knew exactly what happened to the stroller: the luggage tag is always white, and the stroller gate check tag is always pink. They willingly made us run around the airport while holding a sleeping child, because they didn't want to do the work of correcting the mistake of the gate attendant in Joao Pessoa. I was shocked and appalled by the lack of professionalism that we faced during our journey. This experience left me feeling disrespected as a customer, as well as an individual. The airline made it very clear that they have zero regards for the health and experience of their customers, regardless of their age group. I'm utterly disgusted that my 1.5 years old son was treated in this manner. All my attempts to contact the airline to make things right were fruitless. The customer service representative simply hung up on me when I called. Avoid them like a plague. This is a money-grabbing conglomerate that doesn't care about their passengers' wellness and safety.

### "Disappointing Premium Economy experience"
Disappointing Premium Economy experience. I recently flew with Latam Airlines on Flight LA3354 in Premium Economy, and it was an utterly disappointing experience. From the lack of organization during check-in to an unexpected filming activity onboard, the journey fell far short of what one would expect. The unannounced filming not only invaded passengers' privacy but also caused a significant delay in our flight, disregarding our time and schedules. The crew's activities created a distressing atmosphere, and issues with seat functionality added to the discomfort. Moreover, the delay in service due to staff involvement in filming left passengers confused and dissatisfied, with no clear explanation or resolution from the airline. Despite reaching out to Latam Airlines for a resolution, the response has been lacking. It's disheartening when an airline fails to address such grievances promptly and adequately. Overall, my experience was subpar, and I hope Latam Airlines takes these concerns seriously to improve their service quality for future passengers. Sanjay Chadha

### "Enjoyed it as a budget short flight"
Great budget airline. Easy to book online. Just book flights, baggage and insurance. Check in no queues. New planes. All seats had screens. Entertainment good. Phone chargers every seat. Plane windows can tint windows. Only downside no choice of meal but my flight was only a 3hr flight and at least you get a meal! Enjoyed it as a budget short flight. Would recommend.

### "very poor quality main meal"
Fairly old plane for intercontinental flight. The service during the flight from the flight attendants was very limited. For 11 hours of flight, a very poor quality main meal and an equally terrible snack. No drink service during intermissions. Limited entertainment due to lack of language options in films and TV series. On both trips my headrest was broken. Aereo per il volo intercontinentale abbastanza vecchio. Il servizio durante il volo da parte degli assistenti di volo era davvero limitato. Per 11 ore di volo, un pasto principale di pessima qualità e uno snack, altrettanto pessimo. Nessun servizio drink negli intermezzi. Intrattenimento limitato per via della mancanza di opzioni di lingua in film e serie tv. In entrambi i viaggi il mio poggiatesta era rotto.

### "how kind and friendly the crew was"
This flight was on an ex VivaAir Colombia A320 with vivaair interior so there was no latam play and the interior of the aircraft was still in viva air’s configuration. After flying in from New York in the morning I spent the day and early afternoon and returned to El Dorado for my flight to Cartagena. Check in at LATAM’s premium counter was a breeze. Upon boarding our lead flight attendant Jessica welcomed every premium economy individually and we all had a water bottle waiting at our seat. Since I switched rows so a guy could be with his kid I went to Row 1 seat A. There was tons of legroom the only bad thing was the window was dirty so I couldn’t really see much. About 20 minutes after take off we were offered beer, water juice and coffee. I opted for a Club Colombia we were also offered chips and a little bar with chocolate. The flight itself was quick. One thing is the seats didn’t recline at all since the aircraft was still in Vivas configuration but it was made up by how kind and friendly the crew was on this flight.

### "Really nice flight"
Really nice flight. Joint lounge at Rome called Premium Plaza was definitely not premium. Boarding was easy, warm welcome with crew immediately learning your name. I lucked out with row 10 which was at least 20cms longer than the rest. Very comfortable flat bed. Food was reasonably good but far from exciting. The "champagne" was below acceptable standards. The other wines were adequate. A 12 hour flight is quite demanding and I think Latam did a great job I'd happily fly again and would choose them ahead of a lot of the competition.

### "One of the worst flight experiences"
One of the worst flight experiences I have had. Crew members are not friendly. Food is unbeatable and the portion is small for the first leg which is almost 5 hours. They don't provide options. They handed us sandwiches that we don't even know what's inside. After the service, no one showed up in the cabin at all.

### "Worst travel experience"
Worst travel experience I've ever had. From their system having incorrect visa requirements and blocking me from being able to check in for one of my flight sectors despite having sold me a ticket including those sectors, to delays at almost ever sector, to a cancelled flight for one sector with very poor communication. The onboard staff were friendly, but that was literally the only thing Latam had going for it.

### "worst airline in the world"
At check-in at the Bogota Airport, Latam could not print my boarding pass for the connection in Chile and suggested to ask for it when touching down in Chile. It became a nightmare as they did not listed me in the connection flights and had to wait until last minute to board at Chile and then Auckland. My suitcase arrived damaged and I claimed within the 7 business days of my arrival but they did not accept the claim because for their convenience they ended up counting 7 calendar days. They are the worst airline in the world. I pray I don’t need to use them never again.

### "Worse experience ever"
Not Verified |  I have been experiencing a hard time buying my check bag, after multiple tries I spoke with a representative on the phone who recommended adding my bag on the airport because on the phone they had additional fees, once I got to the airport each checked bag was $150, literally $67 more. Their customer service was awful. I said I was going to get it online where the rep. told me I was going to lose my flight if I was getting out of line, I was literally 3 1/2 hrs early for my flight. But the harassment was awful, I told them I called and I was given the info about adding the bag, she said she was not able to see so she ignored me giving no other option. Worse experience ever, we ended paying more on bags than the ticket itself. Please don’t use this airline is not worth it.

### "pitiful customer service"
LATAM was the only airline making a direct flight btwn Miami and Fortaleza, Brazil (for Nov 1 2023). I paid about $125 extra to book this vs. flying MIA all the way down to Sao Paulo then 3.5 hours back up to Fortaleza. Then about 5 months after I bought my airfare looks like they've cancelled this route. I asked for a partial refund, or at least for them to compensate me by letting me choose my seat ahead for no charge, and they denied both requests. The only options they'd allow (and the rep even spoke with his manager as I requested) was to cancel their rebook for a refund or take the rebooked flight through SP. Not fair; pitiful customer service.

### "I will never choose LATAM again."
It was a total rip off, I was charged 280 Canadian dollars for carryon baggage! This is total unacceptable! I will never choose LATAM again.

### "LATAM is mediocre as usual"
LATAM is mediocre as usual. Although I have Gold status at BA and purchased a first class ticket, their service is zero. Ground staff is an exception, always very attentive. Flight crew doesn’t seem to care whether or not you get on board… they are always talking to one another. Service onboard is almost non existent, worse than low fare airlines in Europe. Why don’t they sell food onboard? Probably because they don’t want to bother. I have flown in Brazil 10 times this year, and it is always an unpleasant experience with LATAM. The only reason is that I get priority check in and free luggage, which I’m entitled due to my status.

### "feels like proper Business Class"
Classy Planes, Classy Seats and Staff OK. Luxury and feels like proper Business Class. Food was good. Seats very comfortable with a Large Pillow and Duvet supplied. Not the 1st time we have flown Latam and would fly again any time.

### "actually a very nice flight"
A 22.45 departure 3,5 hrs flight with time difference resulting into an arrival at 4.30 and making it a potential unpleasant extreme red-eye flight. Very efficient boarding by attentive a friendly ground staff. Surprised to have found on every seat blanket a pillow, which was very welcoming. For those not willing to sleep on this 3,5 flight, a cheese toast together with some fruit a chocolate including drinks was offered. Was actually a very nice flight. Nice feature of interactive onboard entertainment system through Wifi, including movies and route map.

### "Worst of the worst"
Worst of the worst. Our plan was to fly from Cusco to Iquitos (via Lima) on Aug-15 and then from Iquitos to Lima on Aug-17. LATAM cancelled our flight from Cusco to Lima and reschedule it for Aug-16. Due to which we missed all our other flights. We had to change our itinerary and cancel Iquitos from our trip because of LATAM. Losing all money paid to hotel, flight, prearranged car. Total loss incurred for 4 people was $1800. When I called LATAMLATAM to refund the ticket money for all missed connections, their agent said that's not their policy. Absolutely garbage airlines. As another reviewer said: Fly Sky instead.

### "just incompetent and awful"
Not Verified |  It is less about the fact that weather can cause issues mid-flight, and that cancellations happen sometimes. It is more about the fact that Latam customer services will force you to wait 5 hour to rebook your flight even if you're the first person in line, that their website does not work at all to make a complaint, or that their customer services tells you to book a hotel and that it will be covered by Latam if you file a ticket, since they're forcing you to wait 16 hours for another flight (when most of the rest of your plane was placed on same day flights even though they were behind you in line). Turns out Latam are greedy, dishonest, and incompetent as their online rep and twitter account both disregard your complaint and claim they wont cover the hotel since the flight was turned back due to weather. Here's the thing - that would not have been an issue if it was ever what the Latam agent said even once at the airport. Have had many other issues with them in the past and this is the final straw. They are just incompetent and awful. Fly sky instead, or any other option available.

### "absolutely horrific"
LATAM airlines is absolutely horrific. On my round trip to Concepcion, Latam managed to delay one of my flights three hours, costing me over 400$ to change my other flights so I would be able to make them. Over 5 hours in the Santiago airport waiting for them to figure out a flight for us to take, screwing up our airbnb reservations and making us lose a full day of vacation, they failedto organize the SHUTTLE back to the airport the next morning, so we had to figure that out on our own. When the flight was delayed, they didn't give a voucher for food or provide a place to stay in Santiago, and our flight wasn't for another almost 24 hours.

### "kind enough to arrange a complex routing"
Not Verified |  Ingrid (LATAM airlines) at Rio Airport was kind enough to arrange a complex routing for our luggage from Rio to Paris via São Paolo and Zurich. Thank you Ingrid!

### "refuses to issue a full refund"
I bought a ticket with an agency for a LATAM flight and had to cancel because of illness. Even though the airline policy is to issue a full refund in case of medical inability, they have refused to do so for over 2 months now. They keep playing the talk to the agency game, even after the agency has confirmed that the airline refuses to issue a full refund and will only give the taxes back (less than 10% of ticket amount).

### "I would strongly recommend LATAM"
I flew a total of 5 flights with LATAM the last two weeks. Mexico-Santiago (Business) Santiago-Calama-Santiago (Economy) Santiago-Auckland-Sydney (Business) All flights were on time and the ground and cabin crew were so professional and polite. I wasn’t expected much by reading the review but honestly LATAM became probably the best airline for me. Food was great, drinks choice pretty good. Service onboard was impeccable and seat were comfortable. Entertainment on long haul business was perfect and had lot of choice. Baggage not lost and check in always easy and fast. I would strongly recommend LATAM and give them a chance.

### "service is terrible"
Not Verified |  If I could rate the service of this company in numbers, I would give it a -10 and no less than zero stars. On August 11 2023 I traveled through LATAM airlines, flight 4402 to connect my connection in Miami on an international flight. My odyssey began when I arrived at the El Dorado airport in Bogota to check in. The number of passengers, the chaos, disorder was like a movie. Very few airport staff do not have the training and even to my surprise almost no one speaks English. Continuing with my checking, it could not be done electronically, so I was redirected to the counters personally. When entering the checking line we had an average of 20 people with only 2 people from customer service. Ask a LATAM employee why you were waiting and if there was no staff for international passengers to attend to them directly. He replied no, that the same waiting line was for national and international passengers. I explained to him that in my opinion it was not right and the ticket costs were different (obviously the international tickets were more expensive) and in the case of connections they were more harmful for me. He told me that he couldn't do anything. My ODYSSEY really started there since when I checked the lady at the counter told me that my luggage had exceeded 20 Kilograms (approximately 40 pounds) and that I had to pay the excess. I answered that the suitcase had already been paid for at the place of origin in the United States and that I did not understand why I had to pay for it again. The lady from LATAM told me that I only had it for 10 pounds and OH my surprise when she told me that I have to pay an extra US$177.00 if I wanted to send it with my flight. I decided not to do it and tried to talk to a supervisor who never showed up and shone by his absence. When checking the prices of the suitcases on the website, costs between US$ 14 and up to US$ 25 appear on domestic flights but nothing is indicated for international flights. No one gave me an answer to what happened, so I filed a complaint on the LATAM website. In addition, the cabin service was of poor quality since there is no empathy or sympathy with the flight employees, low quality food and low communication too. My conclusion, if this review is of any use, do not travel with this airline since its service is terrible, unprofessional and the only thing they want is your money.

### "Boarding was a mess"
Boarding was a mess, they have some people in training but it was like everyone was in training and no one knew anything. It took more than two hours and at the last minute I was told that my luggage was not included and I needed it to pay again. We were running out of time and they ask for this ridiculous amount of money $355.49 for two bags about 35 lbs e/a they assured me that if it was already included they will refund the money in Miami but this never happened. Basically, they held us hostage, until the last minute to make us pay. We paid the full amount for the trip to Delta Airlines and the luggage was included both ways we flew in with four bags and came back with only two bags. I made the claim and they said that I agreed to pay, but it was no other option at the last minute if they told us it before I could leave the bags with my brother but after all this time he was gone.

### "Sad experience"
Boarding was a mess, there was no room for those of us who had the correct luggage, and we put small things in the front seat, the compartments were full of other passengers' small things. Why make rules if then they don't enforce them? The food was completely cold, impossible to eat. The flight was delayed by more than 1:30 pm, for a "medical" reason. That was the only comment after keeping us on the plane for that time without any explanation. Then in Lima, with a 5:00 p.m. wait for the next flight, they could not explain to us whether or not we should pay the airport tax of more than 30USD per person if we wanted to re-enter the airport after going out to the city to a nearby hotel. The best response we got from the airline was that it was "random. Sad experience, unfortunately not the first with this airline, I will do my best to avoid it in the future. | El embarque fue un caos, no habia lugar para quienes teniamos el equipaje correcto, y poniamos las cosas pequeñas en el asiento delanterio, los compartimientos estaban llenos de pequeñas cosas de otros pasajeros. Para que ponen reglas si luego no las hacen cumplir? La comida estaba completamente fria, imposible de comer. El vuelo estuvo retrasado mas de 1:30hs, por una razon "medica" Ese fue el único comentario luego de mantenernos ese tiempo dentro del avión sin ninguna explicación. Luego en Lima, con 17hs de espera al vuelo siguiente, no pudieron explicarnos si debiamos o no pagar la tasa del aeropuerto de mas de 30USD por persona si queriamos volver a entrar al mismo luego de salir a la ciudad a un hotel cercano. La mejor respuesta que logramos de la aerolinea fue que era "aleatorio". Triste experiencia, lamentablemente no la primera con esta aerolinea, haré lo posible por evitarla en el futuro.

### "I will never fly LATAM again"
Very disappointed by the level of service provided for flight LA 2435 Lima to Mendoza, caused over 2 hours delay! The Pilot failed to show up and LATAM failed to take responsibility for unprofessional service. Waiting area we’re all stuck was completely inadequate conditions. LATAM website doesn’t except complains forms. I was trying to submit the complaint form three times to submit still failing. I will never fly LATAM again.

### "worst airline I ever flown with"
Not Verified |  By far LATAM is the worst airline I ever flown with. Not only the flight departed over 1:30 hour late, but they charged a ridiculous amount of money per luggage for a family of 3. I paid $120 per check in bag each weighted 20 kilos one way, and $80 per bag for the return flight. I go to Bolivia every year and whenever I purchase international tickets. Bags are included. I will never flight or recommend LATAM to anyone.

### "Still haven’t received the luggage"
Not Verified | Checked in 3 suitcases and at arrival only 1 arrived. Filled out the lost luggage claim. Day after confirmed luggage had arrived and would be delivered shortly. Still haven’t received the luggage. Have been exchanging with the WhatsApp page useless. Tried calling number but can’t leave message because voice message is full over 20 exchanges. This company should not be in the airline service useless!

### "Very nice experience"
Very nice experience. Staff was very friendly and helpful at the airport. They also offered to check in our slightly big hand luggage which made the trip easier. I was just very surprised and happy with how friendly they were, and how pleasant then the whole experience was. Flight was comfy and snacks were good.

### "my worst airline experience"
We flew Latam but on Delta, so the trip itself was not a problem. The real problem is if you need to make any changes to your ticket, you are really doomed. Let me explain why. I had to change the tickets dates for me, my kids and my mother in March 2023. Every time I called it was a different problem. Every single time they encountered a problem in the system. Every time I called (same day) the fare would have a different price, it would vary from 2k to 3k and then $700 on the same day (this is only the fare difference on the ticket I have already purchased). I know the fare changes constantly, but it didnt make sense .. every representative would give me a insane price every time I called. The changing fee would be different on every call.. on one call he said there would be no fee, another one told me it would be $150, and then $300 and $450 .. no consistency. Even when I agreed to pay a lot more for the fare difference the system would not process the payment and I would have to call back later and go through the same process over and over again. Also, my mother was on a different reservation so I had to double the calls because they could not resolve everything in a single call always saying the system was down or payment could not be processed at that time. After several calls the problem was resolved at 2am. Don't get me wrong, the customer service representatives are polite and friendly but they cannot help! Fast forward to June I had to change my mother's reservation again. When I booked her ticket several months ago, I bought a more expensive ticket so we could have flexibility on changes, and it was the same nonsense. Several calls, crazy fare changes and to put the ticket on hold they wanted to charge me $450 + changing fees, + the fare difference whenever I book in the future.. so it was better just not show up for this flight and buy a new ticket with another airline company. I don't usually write reviews, but I wasted so much time and money that Latam was my worst airline experience.

### "it is only for handbags"
Not Verified |  Hopefully I won't need to fly with LATAM again. I made a mistake and booked 3 tickets with only one 23 kg luggage although I had 3x10 kg handbags. My mistake that l had to pay for 2x10 kg but no I had to pay for 2 x 23kg luggage. And they couldn't speak English most of them but there was always one person who could speak English but couldn't understand the difference between 10 and 23 kg. Cusco - Lima, we get in the airplane and we want to put our bags in the overhead bin because it seems to be empty so we don't have to keep them under our seat. The air hostess tells us that it is only for handbags, we accept it and them we watch her let other travelers put their bags in the overhead bin and it was not only one or two travelers, we were sitting back where it was not so full as the front part ... then we asked her why are they allowed to put their bags in the cabinet and she told us that she cannot control everyone.

### "been treated appallingly"
After travelling to Peru with 14 paramedics to participate in a charity trek, my luggage arrived 7 days after me. My flight consisted of 3 transfers: London to Madrid, Madrid to Lima, and Lima to Cusco. I knew in advance that I had to collect my luggage in Lima and recheck in. When attempting to collect my luggage in Lima mine was the only one not to arrive. I immediately sought help but was advised to board my flight to Cusco and the gate was about to close and open a claim when I arrive in Cusco. Latam 1st admitted responsibility, then decided that no compensation would be paid as the case was opened in Cusco, not Latam. I explained that was advised to board the plane due to the gate closing but they would not accept this. They are trying to tell me that it is my fault, despite the airline in Latam telling me that they withheld my luggage in Madrid and returned it to London, so it was never available for collection. When my luggage finally arrived 7 days later, the staff at Lima airport were passive-aggressive and called security when I asked how I claim the delay. The gentleman made me feel so uncomfortable as if I has been in the wrong. The lock had been forced open and everything inside the case searched. I have been treated appallingly from start to finish. Latam ruined this experience. When returning home, 3/of my colleague's bags did not arrive at the final destination.

### "It was a pleasure flying with LATAM"
This was my first long haul flight on a Latin American carrier. Prior to boarding the plane in Lima everyone’s bag was searched for “contraband” (water bottles or any liquids over 250ml). Once onboard the flight I was welcomed by the crew, made it to my seat which was originally a window, thankfully the guy next to me took up my offer and switched to aisle. Even though the cabin was outdated those seats were extremely comfortable and provide great recline. Each seat had a blanket, pillow and headphones. About hour and a half after take-off there were two options for dinner Asian style chicken and rice or pasta with seeds. As for drinks they had sodas including inka cola as well as beer and wine. Inflight entertainment is pretty good. The only thing that was missing on this flight was in between meals they offer nothing but drinks not even chips. An hour prior to landing we were given breakfast which was a warm ham and cheese sandwich with fruit and drink offerings. Since it was an overnight flight most people slept. It was a pleasure flying with LATAM.

### "crew were extremely nice and courteous"
This was my first trip on the Peruvian subsidiary of LATAM. Boarding in Bogota was quite easy and less chaotic than usual. For a 2.5 hour flight we were provided with a “snack” a bag of chips, cookies and juice. I was able to choose an exit row seat which has extra leg room at no cost. As far as the crew on this flight they were extremely nice and courteous. The LATAM movie app did not work until about midway through my flight.

### "flight was quite uneventful"
This flight reminded me of flying with LATAM during the pandemic. Check in at the airport was a breeze and flight left on time. Unfortunately their onboard movie app did not work at all and due to there being a lot of turbulence the crew stopped serving water after only a few rows. So this flight was quite uneventful.

### "flight wasn’t bad at all"
For a short hot to San Andres the flight wasn’t bad at all. Check in online was a breeze, I dropped off the luggage at Bogota Airport, went through security and was at the gate within 10 minutes. Boarding was quick but extremely chaotic with people clogging up the the queue even though their section hadn’t been called. Flight crew was very pleasant and this time they offered some pack of peanuts and either water, coffee or tea. The latam inflight entertainment app has a very good selection. The flight landed on time and as usual deplaning was extremely chaotic. But I do think that’s just a Colombian thing. Overall it was a good flight.

### "an onboard service shocker"
SCL-GRU in business class B-787. This was an onboard service shocker: boarded flight at 345pm for a 430pm departure, had a short 30 minute mechanical delay. I was not approached by any member of the crew to welcome me on board, offer a glass of water, juice or champagne while on the ground and the first contact with the crew was almost three hours after boarding when they served lunch. I've never been on an international business class flight where this had happened. The crew was completely missing in action. I have no idea what they were doing but they did nothing customer facing for three hours - this was a $1000 return ticket? This is the equivalent to going to a very expensive restaurant and prepaying for the meal and having nobody approach your table with any kind of greeting or service for three hours. It's outrageous. I talked to the purser about it before the flight ended and she was unapologetic and had lame excuses such as they can't do anything for 30 minutes while over the Andes which I totally understand but she didn't address the lack of service while on the ground for two hours because there was no defense. The SCL crews are very arrogant and the airline should be ashamed of themselves. I'd also add the 2x2x2 configuration is old school and offers zero privacy from neighbors and unless you're in the center section someone will be crawling over you to get to the aisle or you will be crawling over them. IFE was touch and go the entire flight One highlight worth noting is the SCL lounge is exceptional in every way, best in South America for sure. It's a shame their onboard product isn't in the same league

### "The app is horrible"
First off they force masks which isn't bad, but they don't tell you until you get to board. I almost lost my flight trying to find one in Bogota airport and had to pay 20 dollars for the one I got. The app is horrible and I paid for a window seat and didn't get it. As the app didn't save my boarding. Lastly the check in and boarding staff at the gate in Bogota airport are rude. They lost my bag on my arrival flight had to send it with Avianca and i got my clothes a day late and my bag was beaten to hell. No wifi, no video screens and no electric plugs. The cabin staff are wonderful but that can't make up for how horrible a company LATAM is.

### "extremely impressed with this flight"
Not Verified |  I was extremely impressed with this flight, the best I’ve been on yet. the whole cabin is in pristine condition, the meals were wonderful! The bathrooms were always kept extremely clean which I find is uncommon on airplanes. The movie and entertainment selection was unmatched! Only complaint is how little the chairs recline. Other than that, best flight I've ever flown.

### "loved every minute of this flight"
Not Verified |  Simply loved every minute of this flight. The entire stuff are courteous, plane is very comfortable. The screens are filled with all the entertainment one can handle. Food is unbelievable, a full bar of beverages. The hand and carry-on bags were also free. Thank you for that peasant experience.

### "authentically friendly and helpful"
Premium Economy on Latam on some routes seems to replace Business Class. The result is some more legroom, the centre seat (3-seat unit) is unused and bigger, better catering and forward cabin seating. Sometimes the centre seat is just unused, sometimes it becomes a tray. Crew are quite good, authentically friendly and helpful. Catering is ample and simple. Lounge access and priority baggage are included.

### "attendants were indifferent"
First time traveling to Chile. To get from Belize used Copa (very poor) and Avianca (horrible-the Spirit Airlines of S. America - you get nothing-not even water-on a 6 hr flight from Bogota to Santiago-they used to be great). Once in Santiago, I took an RT from SCL to Easter Island-6-7 hour flight. Delayed over an hour as it appeared this was the first time they ever had a full flight to Rapa Nui-that was the delay-getting passengers on the plane-an hour late, no connecting flights! The meal? Worst ever by far penne pasta, sauce and a sliver of queso, no meat and flavor. Same meal 4 days later on my return flight. And on my other two flights to Puerto Natales and Calama later on they serve soda out of a room temperature plastic bottle into tiny cups. The flight attendants were indifferent, but they weren't surly, rude and hostile like AA flight attendants.

### "bottom of efficiency"
Not Verified | Never make the mistake to fly this airline again. I flew them several times. Making changes with them is a very long process and even flight in the higher class they charge you money. When you want refunds they give you vouchers and it is absolutely impossible to change them or get that money back. I am frequent traveller of many airlines and I can tell for experience LATAM is at the bottom of efficiency and they are absolutely thieves.

### "Do not ever use this airline"
Not Verified |  Do not ever use this airline. I am speaking from experience as someone who has traveled to over 60 countries and used at least 80 airlines. Their flights are either delayed or canceled 75% of the time and they won’t hesitate to change your flight from early am to late pm for no reason other than they want to resell your ticket. If you want to introduce havoc and headache and heartburn to your travels by all means, go ahead and book with the airline.

### "impressed with service and punctuality"
Flew from LIM to BOG in Premium Economy. There was no one at the Premium checkin, so I was done in seconds. The Sumaq lounge was fine with a good selection of food and drinks. We left on time and arrived early. Cabin was fine, with middle seat blocked out. We were given pillow, blanket and a small amenity kit which I wasn’t expecting. The flight attendant for our cabin introduced himself to each passenger and said to let him know how he could help. Breakfast was served and then I had a couple of beers. I had a question about luggage transfer at BOG and the attendant went out of his way to get me an answer. The BOG to MDE flight was delayed by about an hour but the flight itself is so short that we almost caught up time. For a 29 minute flight, they still served a small sandwich with crisps and a drink. I was impressed with both the service and the punctuality.

### "turned into seven hours of hell"
That was supposed to be a short 30 minutes flight trip which turned into seven hours of hell. First of all, to check in our bag at Medellin airport we had to queue for 1.5 hours, as there is a lot of Latam staff at the airport but they are normally too busy to chat with each other. Secondly, after security check completed, just before boarding time, we found out that our flight had been cancelled. All the passengers approached the lady who was registering passengers at another gate for another flight. She helped a few who had connections and asked others to return back to check in area to reschedule the flight. The majority of passengers who did not have the luggage could just reschedule their flights online without leaving the gate area and queuing up again. Yes, this is where another minus one star from the rating is coming. Three ladies who for some reason were standing together at one counter to regulate the queue found a brilliant solution asking all the passengers of the cancelled flight queue to the check in counters again. At some point, I connected to the airport WiFi and helped some passengers to reschedule their flights online without queuing up, so they could go to do their security check again and return to the gates area. The fourth lady (as three others were again busy chatting and laughing in the middle of this chaos) who was walking in the queue was very surprised it was possible to reschedule the flight online. Passengers with the luggage were expected to pick up their bags and re-check in them again. Our problem was they could not find our bag. After a few attempts the check-in representative suggested that it might went to Bogota (how? on cancelled flight?) as they cannot allocate it in Medellin, and he suggested that the bag will fly on the same plane with us, as I re-scheduled the flight online. Another minus one star for professionalism. Full of doubts we boarded the re-scheduled flight. Of course, our bag was not in Bogota upon arrival. Six people working at Latam Luggage Tracking kiosk could not allocate it and after exchanging a few calls with Medellin staff suggested to fill the form and promising our luggage will be delivered to London. This is when my trust in Latam ground staff fell below zero. Again, with mixed feelings of hopeless and doubts we filled the form, staff returned us a copy asking to check the status online. We decided to check the online service immediately and found out there was not a tracking or reference number on the form! The answer was appalling: "Oh, we have not register your form online yet!". Really? And how we were supposed to check the status online without tracking number? Another star off. Meanwhile next two Latam flights from Medellin arrived and whilst we were patiently asking the Latam staff to do their job, I turned around and found our bag among others from the next flight. Guess what? Another passenger's luggage tag were attached to our bag! Latam, is it safe? Is it professional? Of course, nobody from Luggage Tracking kiosk could answer how come the other passenger's name tag was on our bag. They just pretended they did not hear that question. The passenger's problem is up to the passenger to solve it. And lack of investment in staff is shocking.

### "shocking customer service"
Not Verified |  My review is not specifically about the flight but the shocking customer service. We bought a ticket with LATAM for a return flight. They lost our bags and took zero ownership of both finding the bags and compensating us for the delay of over 48 hours for us having to replace what we did not have. The bags were eventually found by us and were flown the following day by LATAM, but no one from LATAM or their ground agents did anything to contact passengers to advise. If it weren't for one of the other passengers having an Apple Airtag, we would have never known where our bags had gone. LATAM's so-called customer support tried to hide behind an IATA rule to say it was another carrier's problem as we had been put on another flight when ours was cancelled. This is despite the other airline never getting our bags and LATAM flying our bags to their destination. Do not trust this airline with your bags or stick with any conditions of the ticket agreement or international flying agreements for passengers.

### "6 months to receive half of the refund"
Not Verified |  I purchased a ticket in April 2022 with full refund protection. I cancelled a few days later but it took 6 months to receive half of the refund and a further 4 months to receive another 1/4. I have spent hours on the phone and get no where, I raised case after case.

### "Worst experience I've ever had"
Worst experience I've ever had. They lost one of my bags and damaged my other bag, I've been without my things for 3 days now and they have not stayed in proper contact with me and told me on my second day they could not deliver it after 12 and they would deliver it to me on the 3rd day but I still haven’t received any information or my bag. They also won’t take any responsibility for the broken bag, they ripped my zipper right off and now the bag is not usable and I need to replace it with my own money. I also asked to go pick my bag up from the airport myself and they haven’t given me the option to do that even tho the lady that assisted me at the airport said I would be able to. This is my first time and last time flying with them.

### "they are the absolute worst"
Not Verified |  I did a trip to South America four years ago, and many of my flights were with LATAM. Let me say as someone who has been to 60 countries and flown at least 100 airlines, they are the absolute worst. You can literally book an early morning flight that you have to have, on Tuesday, four weeks before the trip and by Thursday they’ll tell you “sorry, we had to reschedule it to a late night flight”. Really all they are doing is bumping you for somebody that might be using their SkyMiles. They’ve done that to me three out of five trips. The other two flights they were late, so they are batting 0% for efficiency. Again, I am saying they are the worst out of 100 airlines without exaggeration as someone who has traveled to over 60 countries.

### "my worst travel customer service"
Not Verified | Our flight from Sydney to Santiago with LATAM was cancelled due to the Auckland floods. No contingency flight was arranged. There was no communication from LATAM regarding what to do next. Call center staff had no idea what was going on with the floods and what LATAM's response would be (whether or not there would be a contingency and how to proceed). LATAM call staff became argumentative when we asked to speak to someone who knew what was happening in response to the flood cancellations and hung up on us several times. LATAM also refused to provide a full refund, claiming that another airline prevented them from doing so, even though the entire booking was through LATAM. They have essentially stolen from me. Definitely my worst travel customer service experience ever. I will be avoiding this airline in future.

### "Avoid this airline"
Not Verified |  Avoid this airline like the plague. They cancelled our flight, said they'd organise another then just ducked us for 6 months. We've lodged 4 claims, messaged on social media, sent someone into the local office in Chile and no response. I literally have no words for how backwards this company treats its customers.

### "Can’t really recommend"
Not Verified |  The first flight I was served a long life kosher meal that tasted not good so I left it thinking I would eat on my next flight. I boarded my flight at Sao Paulo and dinner was served some time into the flight. It was crammed, I was in row 47, it was claustrophobic everyone was so close to each other. For a very long flight it was not an easy flight in those conditions. The food came as I am lactose intolerant I ordered a kosher meal as milk and meat are not mixed but they forgot to load a meal. The stewardess was apologetic but could not even find me an apple. Any food I had was removed in Chile. I thought I would wait till breakfast of course they could not confirm anything they had did not have lactose, so I ate nothing as again they said they did not even have a bit of fruit to offer me. I did not eat till I got home. 32 hours since breakfast the day I left Santiago. Can’t really recommend such an airline. Steer away if you can find other options.

### "can't be this incompetent"
After I got badly hurt during an attempted robbery in Quito, Ecuador, I could no longer proceed to travel to Peru and Bolivia. So I provided LATAM Airlines with the information and evidence they needed and asked for a refund of both tickets. It was incredibly frustrating to communicate with their customer service. It was like 6 different people were handling my case, without communicating with each other. Several times I got send the same emails by different people, asking for information I already gave them. Either they did not understand or did not want to understand me. To be honest, at a certain point, I got the feeling that all this confusion was on purpose, just to discourage me from getting my refunds back (also based on reading reviews from other passengers). You're supposed to be a professional airline. You can't be this incompetent, can you? Eventually, I got a full refund for one ticket, which is good, but I still lost € 545.97. At this point, I'm just too tired to pursue it anymore, so all I can do is warn my fellow traveler. If the flight goes well, be happy. But if problems arise, you have been warned.

### "expected to pay for the airline's errors"
LATAM is unable to provide adequate support when it comes to flight changes or issues which leaves customers to fend for themselves or fork over a ton of cash to fix LATAM's problem. I do not recommend flying with LATAM if you will have multiple connections or if you're booking out far enough in advance that flight times, etc. might change because it will be nearly impossible to get your itinerary corrected. I purchased my flights directly through LATAM from SAN to LAX to SCL. When it came time to check in for my flight (18 hours before take off) I was unable to check in for my flight; it was impossible via the app and online. I called the LATAM support line and they were able to confirm that the error was an internal booking error (i.e. 100% LATAM's fault) which resulted in me not actually having a seat on the first flight. None of the four reps that I talked to (over four hours) could change the ticket or help me out. They told me that my options were to: 1) Cancel my ticket and be refunded, 2) I could pay to 'change' my flights, or 3) they could open a case and someone would call me eventually. A case was opened, however no one called me within the next 12 hours (at which point my flight was 6 hours from takeoff). I called them again (two hours this time) and confirmed with them what my options were and they confirmed that one of them was cancelling the ticket for a refund, so I told them that I wanted to get a refund for my ticket. Suddenly, this was no longer an option and the person couldn't explain why and also couldn't do anything else. The advice that the rep gave me was to "be patient" which I find unacceptable. They said I could 'try going to the connecting airport and check in there to see what happens," although they separately indicated that if I 'missed' my first flight then the entire trip would be cancelled. About an hour before my first flight was scheduled to take off, I got an email that said "we tried to reach you" to address the case however I had no missed calls and it had no instructions to get in touch with them again. I never received a follow up. Even if they had called, it would have been too late to make it to the airport for my flight on time (even if I was standing in the airport lobby when I answered the call) which is unacceptable. I gave LATAM $1200 for a ticket and only gave me headaches and stress. Their customer service team is not able to fix even basic issues and the customer is expected to pay for the airline's errors. Customer service reps also feel free to hang up on you which happened to me at least three times. I ended up having to buy a whole new ticket for my trip which was almost 2x my original price since, as you can imagine, buying an international flight on the day of the trip isn't going to be cheaper than the original. LATAM's flight schedule changes (a whole other issue that I didn't discuss here, but which cost me and my six travel buddies each 6+ hours on the phone with LATAM) and their other errors cost me $1000+ USD beyond the cost of the initial ticket that I booked.

### "nothing has been returned"
I canceled a ticket on LATAM on September 24th and asked for a refund of the money paid. Since then I have opened more than 10 cases asking for a refund and they close saying that in 15-30 days the money will be in the account. I have been asked several times for documents and bank details. It's been almost 90 days and nothing has been returned and they don't even respond to emails anymore. What to do?

### "I will never fly LATAM again"
I had an absolute horrible experience with them. They do not care about their customers. I had a reservation leaving Iquitos Peru through Delta, but the first leg of the flight was flown by LATAM. LATAM could not verify my flight and kept telling me that it was Delta's fault and I needed to talk to them. Delta put my family on five different flights over a 30 hr period and we missed ever single one due to an issue in the LATAM system. The agents in Iquitos Peru airport are rude, do not know what they are doing. They would ignore me when I would talk to them at the counter and would get up from counter and walk away when I would walk up to them. I am extremely disappointed in LATAM and in the agents working in Iquitos Peru. They treated me so poorly. I will never fly LATAM again, and would suggest the same for you.

### "severe lack of customer service"
I will start by saying this is the first review I have ever left for a company, ever, but their severe lack of customer service warrants being mentioned. Just now, nearly four weeks after voicing a concern and 3 weeks after my booked flight took to the air, I am hearing back. In short, I was in Ecuador with a planned flight from Quito to Guayaquil, roundtrip. Do to some major travel complications, including but not limited to civil unrest in Guayaquil, we were going to miss our initial flight. Two of us tried reaching out via Help Center, Email, WhatsApp, and phone call and never heard back. One of us finally got on the phone - after 30 minutes on hold with international rates - to voice our concerns and the representative, 10 minutes into our claim, hung up on us. We were prepared to sacrifice missing the first leg but wanted to ensure that we could still utilize our return flight (Guayaquil to Quito). Instead of responding to any of our claims (attempted almost daily for a week straight) or listening when we did finally get ahold of someone, they cancelled our reservation and kept our money. We were forced to take an overnight bus - as all other flights were fully booked - which cut into a significant part of our travels. As a travel and tourism professional, working in the industry for many years now, I was taken aback at how inaccessible, inflexible, and ultimately unhelpful LATAM was throughout the entire process. I will not be flying with them again and will not recommend anyone else does either.

### "had the most wonderful experience"
Not Verified |  My wife and I had the most wonderful experience with Latam. The aircraft almost brand new and presented immaculately. Comfortable 11hr flight was hardly noticed as so smooth . Cabin crew were just fantastic with both Fernando and Damien providing us with excellent and friendly service. Seats and amenities were also excellent and this airline is one I look forward to flying with again.

### "It took me 44 hours to get home"
I purchased direct return flights London-Sao Paulo and also 2 internal flights, all with LATAM airlines. I tried to change the internal flights but they wouldn't let me so I had to buy 2 new flights, which I advised them of on the phone and they did not mention that if I miss and legs of the journey that they would cancel my flight home. As a result of missing the original internal flights, my return flight was cancelled automatically and I received absolutely no communication about it. I called LATAM when I wasn't able to check in online as my reservation number no longer worked and they told me there was nothing they could do and that I had to take the hit and buy a new flight home. After 4 hours of anxiety and crying my eyes out, my journey home was rebooked and I had to change flights 3 times with long waits between. To add insult to injury my original direct was boarding at the gate next to mine and I asked if they could let me on. The lady told me she had one seat available but couldn't let me on as the system didn't permit the change. It took me 44 hours to get home. All in all a terrible experience - thankfully I speak Portuguese, otherwise I would have been completely stuck.

### " Their customer service is awful"
Not Verified |  We are 30 minutes late for departure, but the gate staff refuses to admit we are delayed and will not provide any information. When I asked directly (3 times) the agents 2) both lied and said we were not delayed. I realized this is trivial, but honesty is such a simple thing to ask for, yet LATAM can’t even seem to get that right. They should be ashamed of themselves. My recommendation to travelers is to avoid LATAM if at all possible. Their customer service is awful.

### "Nice flight in premium economy"
Nice flight in premium economy in a new airplane. Flight was almost on time. Premium economy is only a free middle seat more legroom and a snack like chips and drinks. But price was very good.

### LATAM Airlines customer review
My wife and I were seated in the third row, with a dividing panel behind us. The cabin crew began to wheel out the service cart from the front of the aisle, took care of the first two rows, and then rolled the cart back to where it was taken from. An unseen person then reached over my shoulder from behind and handed my wife and I each one small bag of nuts. I was waiting for the cart to come back out because I was in the mood for coffee, but it never happened. Everyone past the first two rows weren't even offered water. I looked across the third row and saw someone drinking coffee. I asked why only that person in the third row was served, and I was told that they don't serve coffee to third row passengers because they are in a different flying class. But the first three rows are separated from the rest with a dividing wall. It was only after I had requested for a coffee that I was given one. I thought that this was very inhospitable on their part.

### "Please think twice before using them"
We cancel our trip (New York- Arica) due to COVID, and they gave us electronic credit. Now we want to use the credit, and they say their policy is that we lose the money ~2000 US$ because we call a few weeks late. We have called them many times since September 2022, but they say they will call us, or call your agency. However, they never did. LATAM airlines is a really bad airline, who takes the money of their own clients. Please think twice before using them.

### "LATAM airlines is not your typical airline"
Beware! LATAM airlines is not your typical airline with friendly customer services. If you want a name change, well they say sorry and then cancel your flight and only return the refund amount for the ticket you purchased. One small letter mistake ended up costing my around $300 USD. When I called and asked to stop the cancelation and only wanted a name change they said there was nothing they could do. So just know that if you don't pay the extra upfront for your money back. Had to call 3 different times to get someone who would even tell me what was going on.

### "asked if we had only one bag checked in"
Not Verified |  I have never had to confirm if I had a carry on bag during a layover. Your final destination is attached to the bag and that is how the airlines know to take it from point A to point B, unless it's Latam. Had two layovers and during the first layover, while boarding the next flight, an attendant asked if we had only one bag checked in. Thought it was weird but didn't put anymore thought into it. During the next layover in Santiago, no one confirmed if we had a checked bag but no one ever confirms. Landed in Sao Paulo and guess what, no bag. The airport said they found it and it was still in Santiago. The next day we got a call from Latam saying they lost it, seriously? Now we've been told to give them 30 days to find it, yeah right. Anyone want to take a bet that after 30 days they'll say sorry your loss? I've never seen an airline so unprofessional but I guess that's what you get if you use a cheap airline.

### "changed my opinion of LATAM"
I have flown LATAM throughout South America and have always had good experiences. I recently had news to contact customer service about a lost item. The case and associated number were set up quickly. I was informed the item had not yet been recovered and was instructed to check back after 12 hours of my flight landing. I never received a response - yes or no - about my lost item despite numerous inquiries to the agent who replied to my original message. I don’t expect to have this item returned, but the inability to show the common courtesy of answering me one way or the other has changed my opinion of LATAM.

### "No appetizer or salad"
11h30m of flying time. 1st meal right after we took off. 2nd meal 5 hour later. Last 5.5 hrs not even a drink service. And I am talking about Biz class. Just main course on both meals. No appetizer or salad. 2.5 hrs before arrival none of the lavatories were working and LATAM made us go all the way to São Paulo without a single lavatory. This was a paid Biz fare so anyone thinks I will make this mistake again? Miss so much TAM. LATAM sucks.

### "flight is going to be cancelled"
Not Verified |  After sitting at the gate, they finally tell us as we're boarding that our flight is going to be cancelled. They automatically put us on a flight without asking over 3hrs later with no food or drink vouchers and no explanation.

### "will not accommodate medical needs"
I called LATAM to request an aisle seat, I injured my leg in the Amazon, the website blocked me from doing so. It was 6 hours until the flight. The LATAM person on the phone said he could not help me even in a medical situation, he refused to let me speak to a supervisor. This is bad news an airline that will not accommodate medical needs is to be avoided. I was willing to pay for seat selection, he still would not help. I am medical and will advise my teams to avoid this airline

### "lucky to see a difference with Y class"
Business class on single aisle airplanes with this airline is a scam. Apart from the blocked middle seat, you will be lucky to see a difference with Y class seating arrangements either in width or in row spacing. See photos of Row 2 spacing on the UIO-LIM sector, or the distafful shape of the useless armchair audio commands. Food serving consists of a sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil and a bag of potato chips ( LIM-GRU, 4:30 flight), served at 3:00 am.

### "still trying to get this money back"
I had 2 bookings with Latam. One of them was cancelled due to Covid so I had a credit. I was told I could get a refund on this credit but they ignored all my requests to do so. The credit has since expired and I am out of pocket by US$503. I'm still trying to get this money back. I have received 2 emails from Latam relating to passengers I’ve never heard of. They give the passenger’s full name and bank account details. It makes me wonder who has been receiving emails with my details. My second booking was also cancelled but successfully rebooked. However Latam then drastically changed the booking - three days were cut from my holiday and the return journey was extended from approx 25 hours travel time to over 41 hours (with 11+ hours stopover in Lima and 11+ hours in Santiago). I have tried to solve these issues in various ways with no help: I visited Latam's office in Quito on 10/5/22. They were no help and referred me to the contact centre. I called the contact centre on the same day, that was no help and claimed her "system was not working" and the agent referred me to the Latam website to create a case. I created case number and over 2 months later I have still had no response. I tried to follow up this case and my most recent message to Latam does not even show on their system. On top of this, I was dehydrated on the flight as my requests for water were ignored on more than one occasion. The meals were more like snacks (I am a small female weighing less than 60Kg).

### "Would never fly with this airline again"
Not Verified | Miami to Rio de Janeiro. Would never fly with this airline again. We booked airfare on this airline from Miami, FL to Rio de Janeiro, we had booked a cruise that was leaving from Rio, the cruise was canceled and when we tried to receive a travel voucher for future travel we had nothing but problems. We purchased premium business class tickets and the paperwork we were provided stated we had one year in which to use the voucher. After going back and forth with the agent’s too many times to count we were finally given a voucher in the amount of $1274.34, which we used for a trip to Punta Cana, leaving a balance of $694.46. Have lodged many complaints with the company and they do not respond. Use caution if you have to book with this company, obviously they are a low cost airline for a reason.

### "The worst possible experience"
I checked in with my daughter for flight LA6012 at 5.40 pm from ASU (Asuncion) arriving at 8.30 pm in Buenos Aires (AEP). The flight was delayed (the airline claimed bad weather) and left late at 6.25 pm scheduled to arrive at 21.21 pm. The flight was diverted to Uraguay, we were kept in the plane for about 2 hrs and then flown BACK to ASU arriving back where we started around 11.30 pm. They claimed this was due to bad weather in Buenos Aires. According to arrivals at Buenos Aires (AEP), flights AR1645, AR 1227, AR1505 all landed on schedule at AEP at 21.25 (4 mins after our flight was due to arrive), 21.00 and 20.15. Four other flights landed between 20.30 and 21.05 (later than scheduled). The airline did not book us into a hotel, they did not provide food, they simply said to return at 6.30 am for another flight, that flight confirmation has not come through so I am worried. I have to spend the night in the airport with my daughter. This is outrageous, communication has been very poor, no one has looked after us. The worst possible experience.

### "no way to catch that flight"
Not Verified |  My Terrible LATAM Travel Experience Returning from Rio de Janeiro to Miami. Upon arriving at the airport in Rio de Janeiro, having checked in online, without having had the option to pay for luggage online, a LATAM employee at the check-in desk informed me that I should pay for the 2 bags that would be checked. I went to the payment desk and the LATAM employee made me wait for 30 minutes to tell me how much the fee would be. He told me it would be R$1,300 reais approximately $125 dollars per bag, totaling approximately $250 dollars. Not finding the value of the luggage fee right, I paid it, but it is worth noting that on the way to Brazil, with a much more professional and respectful airline, I paid $35 per bag, totaling $70, instead of $250. I went back to the check-in desk and it took approximately 1 hour when I was attended to check in my bags and print my boarding pass. A LATAM employee left the service desk and went to another closed room, came back, did it several times. When it was close to the boarding time, the LATAM employee said that they would not make the boarding at the scheduled time, as all passengers with carry on should dispatch the same. Not caring about connecting passengers. There was a long delay in completing this process. When finished, we left Rio towards Santiago. Arriving in Chile, I ran with my 6 year old son and my wife so we wouldn't lose the connection. I arrived at the LATAM connection desk and the employee informed me that I had missed it, there would be no way to catch that flight. I arrived at the counter at 12:10am, flight departs at 12:30am. That I couldn't pass the connecting gate, I should take a flight to Lima in the morning at 7:45am, I should wait at the airport for more than 7 hours. Detail that the LATAM employee, very moody, didn't even speak English, I had to unroll my Spanish. As there was no other alternative, I took the boarding pass to Peru and then to the United States. I went to the LATAM VIP Lounge and the employee scanned my boarding pass, but he wouldn't let me in. With all this, I still haven't been able to feed and rest with my 6 year old son and wife. We had to spend the 7 hours in the airport departures area. My son ended up sleeping on the floor of the airport, he was very tired.

### "I was not making it on the flight"
My flight left from Cusco and connected to Lima on my way to New York. No issues on the initial flight. my bag was checked, went through security without any problem. I get to LIMA, had some time to eat, and headed to my gate 25 minutes before departure. Got to the gate, it was mid-boarding, they asked my last name and the staff huddled for a few moments as my G/F and I looked at each other puzzled on what was happening. then I was told "you need to go with her" & pointed to a security person. They said my checked bag had a cell phone portable charger in it, picked up via X-RAY, that isn't allowed and needs to be removed. I start walking with this officer who does not speak English. I have no idea where we are going and went all the way back to immigration. As soon as I left, they turned to my G/F and asked if she wanted to board the plane as I was not going to make it back in time for the flight. She asked if they can hold the flight for a few mins so i can get back but they wouldn't even consider it. I get back to the gate and now learn that the gate is closed and I was not making it on the flight. The desk agent said he tried calling us over the PA. As they only have 1 flight out a day, which departs at 12:20AM, 2 hrs later, we were still in the airport, trying to get our bags back and find a hotel to stay at, exhausted and disappointed. the next day, we return to the airport 2 hours earlier then we needed to just to be sure there was going to be no challenges, only to find out an hour later that the flight was cancelled. So noticing that there was a flight leaving to Miami within the next hour at a nearby gate, we ran there to try to talk to the agents to see if we could get on the flight. They did confirm that there were seats, but they said only 1 woman could let us on, who was at the desk, but they wouldn't let us talk to her. We pleaded with one woman who said she'd try to help, then walked away and clearly gave no effort as she was standing next to that woman, texting on her phone. Trying to get her attention, 10 minutes later we had someone get her but she still gave us more excuses. when I asked her the name of the woman that could help us (who she was standing next to work early), she said she didn't know, laughed & walked away. talked to another man who questioned how we knew our flight to NY was cancelled. So now they have everyone waiting on this ridiculously long and slow line to get a hotel credit. after 40 mins waiting & not moving, we left and found our own hotel.

### "finding out that our bags are lost"
Not Verified |  I was flying from Belo Horizonte to São Paolo and first the flight got moved making me lose my connection to Mexico City. And because of that, they changed our flight telling us the wrong information about what we would get as a compensation. The man said to pick up our luggage in São Paolo. Once we arrived to São Paolo, another man giving vouchers clearly said we shouldn’t pick up our bags because it was directly moved to our final destination. We double (even tripled) asked to make sure as we have been told otherwise, and he assured our bags were on the right track. 12 hours later we arrived finding out that our bags are lost and nowhere to be found even though they had put them on the system even before we got out of the airport. I have been in contact with the airline through WhatsApp asking about my bag status and they only say “it takes time and that I have to wait”. I have asked information about where to go in the airport as I’m flying today to another destination, so I can check directly in the airport but they only can say I need to ask at the airport, not providing any useful information about which terminal or desk should I ask. Not traveling with Latam airlines again, that’s for sure.

### "I still don't have my money"
Latam Changed my flight schedule, so I cancelled my trip. Unfortunately it is not possible for them to return my money because I have a European Bank account. I tried 2 of my personal accounts and now I'm trying to transfer it to a Friend in Ecuador so she can transfer me the money. Now its almost 2 months later and I still don't have my money. This overall customer service experience is the worst I have had.

### "if you like your luggage, don't fly LATAM"
I had a brand new suitcase, and after traveling from Lima, Peru to Quito, Ecuador. I discovered it had two vertical lines across the back and on one it had a cut about an inch long. I had already left baggage, so I went to their counter, and they told me I had to wait 15 minutes for an employee to show up, then they told me 5 more minutes 3 times. I had a shuttle waiting for me, so I took down the employees name and badge number along with a picture of the suitcase. I reported it when I got home and I got a response that says: We want to inform you that to ensure that your experience is the best possible, we have evaluated the background information you have provided and unfortunately, the damages claimed are not included in our compensation policy, since they correspond to those that may occur during the transfer. as a consequence of the normal and habitual handling of luggage such as: scratches, dents, cuts, stains, wear, damage caused by excess weight, or loss of protruding external elements, such as straps, locks or pockets. I guess if you like your luggage, don't fly LATAM.

### "no respect for their customers"
LATAM is fine as long as there are no issues. Our flight got cancelled due to maintenance issues and that's when the trouble started. LATAM personnel is constantly contradicting itself and providing wrong information. They are badly organised in case of a calamity such as a cancellation which causes long and unnecessary waiting times for their costumers under stressful conditions. The company does not give the compensation that it is legally required to provide. The personnel does not seem to care about their customers. Simply no respect for their customers.

### "an absolute nightmare"
In January 2020, I bought a round-trip ticket from Sacramento to Lima for June 2020. Subsequently, the trip was cancelled by the tour company due to Covid. I called LATAM and was told that I could hold open my ticket until the next year. My tour was rescheduled for June 2021 and I rebooked flights on LATAM. The 2021 trip was also cancelled by the tour company due to Covid. I spoke by phone with a LATAM agent who told me my ticket would be held open until June 13, 2020. My tour was rescheduled by the tour company for June 2022. In early March 2022, I began trying to rebook my flights. This turned out to be an absolute nightmare and ultimately unsuccessful. I lost track of the number of attempts I made to rebook this ticket, but it had to be over 20. For about a week, I made several calls daily that resulted in waiting for extremely long times for my call to be answered, only to be cut off. I waited about a week before I started calling again. Now my calls were answered, but I couldn’t believe I was dealing with the same airline I had dealt with in 2020 and 2021. With one or two exceptions, every agent had such poor English that it was extremely difficult to communicate, I never really felt they understood what I wanted, and I, in turn, could barely understand them. Several times, I had to tell someone that I would just have to try another agent. The background noise level was extreme. I had to terminate several calls because it was impossible to hear. With one exception, the agents did not seem to know how to do their job. They told me, variously: that I should use the LATAM website (not seeming to know that you can’t use an open ticket on the website, nor book legs on other airlines), that it was not possible to rebook my ticket, that the flight I wanted did not exist (when I was looking at it on the website), that it was impossible to book SMF-LAX with them (after hearing that several times, I dropped the SMF-LAX portion and just focused on LAX-LIM), that I would have to go from LAX to LIM via Santiago and Miami, in that order (two agents told me this). Finally, I got an agent with good English on a clear line, who was able to book exactly what I wanted. When we were nearly finished, he put me on hold - and the call was dropped. That was when I gave up and bought tickets online. I had to book the SMF-LAX leg separately on another airline. I sent all the above information to the airline with my request for a refund of the $2198.09 I'd paid for the original ticket. After a very long time, they told me I could not have a refund because I'd been told in the beginning that I should rebook my open ticket.

### "they could not be bothered, we do not give refunds was their response"
Not Verified |  Booked to go from Auckland to Peru and then back again. Half way through our holiday they cancelled our flight home. Had to spend two days of the holiday trying to sort out flights home. They gave us one option - leave three weeks later going via Brazil. When we complained they then gave us another option to go via Los Angeles on the day were were supposed to leave but then left us to sort out our ESTA visas to go through USA. I had to ring the UK to get my UK passport number as I was travelling on my NZ passport so that was more cost to me. We had paid for extra leg room seats, never got that money back! So our trip home to NZ was Lima to LA, LA to Sydney Australia (on Qantas) and then Sydney to Auckland with Qantas. Our original flight from Lima to Auckland was available with Qantas their partner airline but because we had booked originally through LATAM they could not arrange us to go with Qantas, yet they could from LA and Sydney. Go figure. We then had to pay again for extra legroom seats which when we got on the plane the cabin crew knew nothing about and I had to complain and show them the payment receipt as LATAM had given us the wrong boarding passes. The cabin crew then gave the other seats in extra legroom to other passengers who had not paid! We were treated dreadfully on the LATAM flight. Was soooo glad to board Qantas flights - we had to pay a extra for their leg room seats but once the crew had heard of our plight the Qantas crew made us feel so comfortable and brought us treats. When we got home I wrote to LATAM to tell them of our experience and they could not be bothered, we do not give refunds was their response. I got really annoyed with them and their couldn't be bothered response and informed them as as a travel and tourism teacher I would using their customer service as an example of not what to do. They are now a case study in my class and the students pretend to be useless LATAM customer service and flight crew and the students critique what was bad service and what a good airline company should do. I use the emails they send and even have a script which the students use. So one positive came out of the experience. The annoying thing is that I want to go back to South America but the thought of flying this useless crew is so off putting. Even if I book with Qantas you may end up with this bunch. My advice for anyone thinking of booking with LATAM / or forced to book with them - warn your employees you may be three weeks later back to work. Take all documentation needed to enter a variety of different countries around the world so you meet their visa requirements and also currencies of those countries so you can by a drink while waiting in the numerous airport lounges you will be forced to wait in. Or just walk home!

### "I do not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Totally underwhelmed by this airline. In the first instance, ticket was expensive. The food service for the short leg of the trip from Brisbane to Auckland was pathetic. Even worse for the Auckland to Santiago leg with the main meal being a dried piece of chicken breast with a small portion of plain rice. It was served on a flat discardable plate with aluminium foil covering. It did not look appealing at all. Not warm enough, chicken hard to cut with plastic cutlery, needless to say the meal was very dried and cold. We were served a cold bread roll with no butter. Only one round of drinks. Breakfast was an omelette however, it didn’t have any ham or cheese. Seats are very uncomfortable. Not enough cushioning. I had to wait 4 hours to catch my flight from Santiago to Buenos Aires. This was not the case when I booked the flight - only 1.5 hours transit. Their app is totally useless, you don’t get any alerts, emails or text messages to the various changes they made to my itinerary. My flight back was even worse. They changed my transit time from Buenos Aires to Santiago from 1.5 hours to 10.5 hours. It took me two days to get back home, totally exhausting. I do not recommend this airline. It seems to me that it’s closer to being a budget airline even though prices are not. I wasn’t even asked for feedback so i guess not interested in pleasing their customers. I won’t use them again.

### "If you can, avoid this company at all costs"
Not Verified |  Flying with LATAM has been my worst flight experience so far. Despite involving a 30 min flight, I managed to experience a 12h delay (which would have been acceptable if they would have done as legally required, meaning warning the passenger of a change in the flight schedule). They advanced my flight 2h, I was coming in with an international connection and had my boarding pass. I show up at the airport and the flight is not programmed, instead of being guided, I was forced to do a super long line (baggage drop off) at 4am in the morning, fight to get my luggage, and fight to get a flight rescheduled. Apparently this was all the "weather". I fail to see how worldwide emails stop, and the customer service of an international airline collapses, when it rains in one city in Colombia but this is so far their explanation. On top of this, they take months to treat every customer claim. If you can, avoid this company at all costs.

### "change the date and time of your flights"
Not Verified |  Don’t ever buy flexible ticket because will never be able to change the dates because their website give error always. They change the date and time of your flights without explanation - they don’t have reachable customer service. The arrival time to make the connection of flights are not compatible we had only 15 minutes to arrive there in Madrid airport after taking a continental flight (10 hours flight). The seats at the plane are too tight and we were not able and limit water in a continental flight.

### "I could not go to Chile"
I bought a LATAM ticket from Cusco to Santiago with a layover in Lima. To begin my travels, in Cusco, where I was told I must be approved to enter Chile or I could not leave for Lima. I provided my very recent (3-hour-old) negative Covid test and tried to download the c19 paperwork, as those were the two stated requirements. There was technical trouble with downloading the document, but the LATAM rep said no worries, it is not that important. You have your Covid test, vaccines and boosters, US documents, etc. LATAM approved me to Chile. (Personal Note: My daughter, who was teaching English in Cuzco had been sick with stomach pain, so if I was not approved, I would have stayed in Cuzco with her.) In Lima, they said the representative in Cuzco was wrong, and I could not go to Chile. I was there hours early. So, I asked for help in getting this document, and they blew me off! Would not help. Essentially, they triaged me and helped all others, mostly Latin Americans. They further assured me three different times a certain gentleman was in charge of the flight would make sure everything cleared. Every time I went to speak with him, he brushed me off. Furthermore, they snuck behind my back, lied to me about getting me on, then asked me my name and passport number so they could pull my luggage from the flight because they knew no one at LATAM would help me. I wrote and called the airline and they did not help.

### "No one could tell me the price of a second piece of luggage"
Not Verified |  Booked a flight through Delta (their partner), so I was unable to add baggage, buy a seat, or add any services (note that booking through LATAM a few months prior did not present me with any difficulties when dealing with Delta). I called, went to the airport a day before, went to their main office in Lima, etc. No one could tell me the price of a second piece of luggage. Online, it varies from $60 to $200. Show up at the airport and I was charged $177. When I asked why, they said I was penalized for not purchasing the bag before. When I mentioned that it's literally impossible to do this, she simply asked "so do you want to check it or not". The airline is in bankruptcy. I really hope someone replaces them.

### "they went way way above the call of duty"
Urns Molina and Mariete Mayos we’re extremely helpful with my ticket reservation to Lima. I had missed the flight the day before and wasn’t in the system and they figured out a solution and got me on board a flight. I think they went way way above the call of duty helping me and I’m very appreciative. Your airline is lucky to have employees like them. Thank you ladies for all your help.

### "I have yet to get my refund"
Not Verified |  I had to change the date within less then 24/hrs for this trip and when I purchased the other flight I was told I would get a refund on my original purchase. As of today, 2 months from the purchase date of my tickets, I have yet to get my refund and am told that it is still processing. I cannot speak to a supervisor and I keep getting asked to not email them. That I am in processing

### "Not good at all"
Not Verified | London to Santiago via Madrid. We flew with LATAM from London to Chile and back and also took several flights within Chile. On the plus side the crew were all friendly and efficient. Like many airlines the food and drink service is minimal now so it feels like a low cost airline. The ticketing, website and associated online services are a shambles and the whole system needs a thorough upgrade. We weren't able to check in online for any of our 9 flights despite the system recognising the booking reference and our name. It just kept generating spurious and meaningless error messages and suggesting we try again later. Not good at all.

### "Avoid at all costs!"
Not Verified |  Terrible experience with LATAM Airlines after booking return Business Premium seats between London and Rio De Janeiro. The airline changed our flight times, dates, flight sectors and completely voided whole sectors from our trip multiple times without notification or explanation. I would notice the changes purely by chance via Checkmytrip.com. Following each change I would dutifully endure LATAM's service call centre for several hours, incorporating dozens of call disconnections, excuses and down right lies ranging from the flight has been cancelled to the flight no longer has availability, all while still selling our seats for said "cancelled, or unavailable" flights on their app and website - this they explained by lying that their website was glitching (for 3 months?) The changes made by LATAM to our booking over the course of a few weeks amounted to the following. The flight we booked (London to Rio de Janeiro (via Sao Paulo) dep 24th Feb and return to London 11th March) becoming London to Rio de Janeiro (via Sao Paulo) dep 25th Feb, return 11th March. Then London to Madrid dep 24th Feb, Madrid to Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo to Rio de Janeiro; then London to Frankfurt dep 24th Feb, Frankfurt to Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo to Rio de Janeiro; Then our return flight began to change without notification or explanation, changed from the flight we booked: Rio de Janeiro to Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo to London dep 11th Mar, which became 4.) Rio de Janeiro dep 11th Mar to Belo Horizonte, Belo Horizonte to Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo to London; then  Rio de Janeiro dep 11th Mar to Brasilia, Brasilia to Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo to London; then  Rio de Janeiro to Campinas, Sao Paulo to London (How do I get from Campinas to Sao Paulo??) then Sao Paulo to London (So now I have to get from Rio to Sao Paulo on my own?). This then culminated in the next change being made to our booking resulting in no return flight at all. After hours and hours on the phone to Customer Services without being offered any explanation or alternative return flight, we decided to continue with the outward journey via Frankfurt and fight it out face to face once in Brazil. On arrival at London Heathrow with bags backed to board the flight to Frankfurt, the check-in agent told us apologetically that we would be unable to board as LATAM had invalidated the ticket for the London to Frankfurt sector. The ticket was on the system but LATAM had not reserved the seats. We were advised to contact Customer services and ask LATAM to Validate the tickets. Invariably the LATAM agent I spoke with hung up on me and we had no where to go. As LATAM had not reserved the seats to Frankfurt via Lufthansa there weren't even seats available for us to purchase directly from Lufthansa to ensure we could make our onward connection to Sao Paulo. The distress and anguish we experienced as a result of LATAM's blatant disregard for their customers was like nothing I'd ever experienced with any other airline. As LATAM contract out their ticketing service to a third party agent (dnata) at London Heathrow, we had no option but to try and explain our situation to the third party agent. This dnata agent incredible and everything that LATAM wasn't. She listened to us, empathised with us and committed to us that she would help resolve the nightmare LATAM had placed us in. She re-booked us back onto or original flight (which LATAM had repeatedly refused to do). Avoid at all costs!

### "suitcase had a non-repairable damage"
Every flight with LATAM (4 in total) during my 3 months Latin America tour was a disaster, both in Premium Eco and Business. No lounge for Star Alliance Gold clients/business passengers in Cusco, no service on board, not even water, priority luggage was the last on the conveyor belt and my suitcase had a non-repairable damage. 1h to take up the damage by the staff and the status quo after weeks of complaints is that they are not willing to pay more than 80 USD despite the luggage being new.

### "one of the worst airlines"
Overpriced and underwhelming Expensive tickets, rigid inflexible staff at the gate, no service on board, horrible hotline customer service. I had no other choice than LATAM for several flights on my Latin America tour but you can see that the airline doesn't care about their customers at all. Surely one of the worst airlines for me together with Avianca.

### "unwelcome as a customer"
As with all LATAM flights so far, no onboard service despite premium economy. No lounge for domestic flights, delays and the feeling of being completely unwelcome as a customer.

### "I almost missed my flight"
Not Verified |  I arrived 3 hours in advance as required by all international flights but no agents for LATAM. They didn't show up for an hour. I was fourth in line. I showed LATAM my booking, itinerary confirmed my flight. They refused my booking. Customer service was useless as they wouldn't even call Air Canada to confirm booking. It wasn't until 4 other people were booked on the same flight did they react at the last minute. I wrote a complaint with a ticket number just to never get a response. What a useless airline. I almost missed my flight.

### "worst service ever"
Arequipa to San Francisco via Lima. The worst service ever, first my flight was delayed, causing me problems with my connections. And now that I am at my final destination, my baggage is missing and nobody knows where is at, and all they did was give me a piece of paper saying we will call you. I will never fly with you again and I do not recommend it to anyone.

### "has been absolutely terrible"
LATAM has been absolutely terrible in every way, we flew from Vancouver BC Canada to Puerto Vallarta and missed our flight due to a cancellation in Mexico city, LATAM cancelled our flight to Santiago Chile on Dec 21 and not a soul in the airport working at LATAM, we had to stay in Mexico city at our own cost in a hotel until they got us a connecting flight on the 24 of Dec. Our return trip from Santiago Chile was no different. We arrived at Mexico city airport to find out our connecting flight to YVR Vancouver had been cancelled, and yet again not one person working for LATAM in the airport was available to help us. Aeromexico was able to book us a flight home to Vancouver BC. LATAM has done nothing to help us besides cost us money in hotel stays, food and phone calls to LATAM trying to get some help. Absolute nightmare. I strongly suggest not flying with LATAM as they have caused my wife and I nothing but problems.

### "This is hospitality to you?"
Staff were very rude, during the flight, the check in was Very disorganized on my way back to US, staff knew a flight got cancel to NY but still other flights were pending during this time. Instead of opening 1 or 2 windows to deal with the NY flight the staff decided to leave it like that and keep All 8 check in stations stuck with fixing a flight that isn’t leaving that night? And make us the other destination passengers (LAX / MIA) wait standing up for 3 hours. On the check in line, we even have time to rush thru Imigration & Customs, this is very unacceptable. I came 4 hours before my flight to be able to eat something in the airport, instead because this incompetent team though it was a good idea to keep everyone waiting and react at the last minute on passengers who were about to miss flights? LAX flight passengers were very outset, why they staff didn’t listen to the advise everyone was suggesting? They just walk away and ignore everyone! This is hospitality to you? Then on the flight, I fall sleep, they just pass with the car with food, they told me they will bring food, I waited and I never got any food or beverage for a 10+ hour flight.

### "the worst service I’ve ever experienced on an airline"
This was the worst service I’ve ever experienced on an airline, and I’m a million-miler on one US carrier and have flown hundreds of thousands of miles on other airlines, including many on Asian budget carriers. Anyhow, my flight LA4297, from CTG-MDE was delayed by 3 hours from 08.51 am to 11.45 am. I had purchased a premium-economy ticket. (On these short-haul flights in Columbia, they only have premium-economy and regular economy seats). When I went to board LA4297, after experiencing the 3 hour delay in a crowded waiting hall during the Omicron surge, the gate agent told me I was bumped to a later flight, LA4295, that departed around 50 minutes after LA4297. Must have been bumped for a VIP, otherwise, they would have bumped a passenger from regular economy class. So I paid more for my seat and got lousier service. When I finally arrived in MDE, four hours after my original scheduled time, my suitcase was nowhere to be found. And nobody from Latam was in baggage-claim to help me. Luckily, an employee from Avianca, the Colombian national carrier, felt sorry for me and helped me find Latam’s office. So after walking 3/4ths of the way around the airport and killing another 1/2 hour, I was able to locate my suitcase that came-in on LA4297. I’m 70 years old. Later, I tried to file a complaint on-line for Latam using their forms. But it kept saying they could not process the claim or something like that.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified | Avoid this airline in Brazil! Totally unreliable. Had two flights canceled. Rescheduled flights caused extra expenses and inconvenience. In one case, the new flight made my US flight connection too tight and at risk of another cancellation or delay. So I had to pay for another flight on GOL at double the cost so I could make my United flight to the US. Could not change my flight, despite airline cancellation, on Mytrip.com, whose US phone number was unavailable from Brazil. LATAM could not put me on a flight that would let me make United flight. Terrible customer service and reliability.

### "Check-in extremely friendly"
Salvador to Rio de Janeiro. Check-in was extremely friendly. As a premium Eco on a domestic flight I did not expect so much attention. Boarding fine. Crew on board did not work at all, except the captain who had precious announcements. No service, even no water.

### "This airline is in the dumps"
No Latam agents present to help through the usual boarding mess, customary to Brazilian bound flights. On board, no catering services available for the entirety of the flight, including individual mineral water bottles. Late departure, therefore late arrival of the plane. No ground support at GRU for connecting passengers who missed their connections. The plane originally landed in Paris at 2PM for a 9:25PM departure. No Email notifications regarding catering issues were provided, nor any excuses after the flight. This airline is in the dumps, with no respect whatsoever for their most valuable passengers.

### "crew on board was extremely friendly"
Not Verified | As there is no separate Baggage drop counter, neither food on board (Covid is a good excuse), premium economy product offers only one benefit on Brazilian domestic flights: no neighbor. Middle seat is empty. Which is also valuable in Covid times. Boarding was completely chaotic, and unacceptable due to the pandemic. Priority passenger were not called. As aircraft was on remote position everyone was in a completely packed bus, with a lot of children (Dec 23rd). On the opposite crew on board was extremely friendly and efficient, cleaning the hands of every passenger after a restrooms visit for example. Captain communicated views from the windows, and smiles were everywhere.

### "will be avoiding"
Flying as a family of 4, we purchased tickets from Lima to Buenos Aires with a short layover in Santiago leaving on 15th December. Latam changed our flight times repeatedly, changing both the date of departure and the arrival airport leaving us with a 10 hour layover from the early hours which we had to endure sleepless and uncomfortable in Santiago. We were told we could change the flights if we weren't happy but there were none available. Latam were not interested in the fact they had changed the date of travel, had added a long overnight layover in spite of the fact we had originally paid extra to avoid that. We were all exhausted upon arrival (plus the usual inedible flight "food") and I will be avoiding this airline in future.

### "Avoid this airline at all costs"
Not Verified |  Absolutely unacceptable airline. I called them to check-in, because I made an offer to upgrade. When I called, I asked for the price to do a direct upgrade instead of waiting for the upgrade offer. I wasn't happy with the price, so declined. Somehow in this process, they changed my seat from 15L - a nice window seat in the Latam+ area - to 23H - a seat with no built-in monitor, a wall in front so nowhere to keep my backpack with me during the flight, and right behind the bathrooms. I called back (a 45 minute wait each time) only to be told (after another 20 minutes of simply asking my name and verifying my reservation code) that there was nothing they could do. They couldn't move me back, there weren't any good seats left (the flight is the next day, 12/3), and that maybe I should check at the airport and see if they can move me. I spent over $100 for the original seat. No way to get a refund because technically, "23H is still a Latam+ seat at the same price". This is a 10 hour flight from JFK to Sao Paulo. This is not the only time I've had trouble with them. Every time I need to make a change, do a check-in, or anything after a purchase, I have to call because their website never works, or simply displays a message saying I cannot make any changes unless I call. Avoid this airline at all costs, it is the worst I have flown in 15 years of flying regularly.

### "What a shame!"
The way this airlines treats their customers is shocking and disrespectful. It's impossible to talk to them to rebook a flight cancelled by the company in July last year and the reservation doesn't show up neither in the app or website. Me and my husband have spent hours and hours trying and listening to the music! Plus the call isn't free. When they finally answer, the call drops before completing the rebooking process! It happened 5 times! And last time their representative lied to us convincing us to hang up and call again later "without having to wait again". What a shame!

### "a nightmare to deal with"
Nothing positive to report from this trip review. Flight was four hours late, missed onward connection to Florianopolis, forced to overnight at GRU. LATAM had apparently organized hotel bookings for us and I received my voucher upon arrival. Unfortunately when we got to the hotel the hotel had no rooms and they claimed LATAM never confirmed any of the bookings with them. LATAM was unreachable to resolve this problem. We tried on social media channels and five different phone numbers. Basically all of us were left to fend for ourselves. Ultimately secured my own room at another hotel and got myself there. Zero chance of being reimbursed by LATAM who refuses to respond to my queries on Twitter. At GRU was told there is not one person who could help resolve this despite it being a hub airport - they said I have to call them - we tried multiple times with no success. They have been completely unresponsive since the problem has occurred and their customer service is less than zero. Their lack of competence is outdone only by their lack of integrity. As for the flight itself, their B767 product is antiquated, circa 1990 in look and feel, badly in need of refurbishment. Seats uncomfortable, 2x2x2 configuration offer no privacy. IFE did not work properly and hardware was falling apart. Business class headphones were the same cheap plastic as economy and they had some dog ate the homework excuse as to why they didn't have the noise cancelling or noise reducing variety that made no sense. Needless to say I'd avoid LATAM and this aircraft for all of said reasons unless you absolutely need to fly them. They are a nightmare to deal with, are extraordinarily unethical in their dealings with customers and they need to be called out for what they are - basically a bunch of frauds. Avoid these people like the plague.

### "regulations are terrible"
Lima to Los Angeles. LATAM Airlines in flight services and rules and regulations are terrible! For domestic flights they provide no in flight services like drinks or snacks. They do not let you stand up altogether after the plane is secured at the gate, and instead require you to stand only by aisle/row. And they are currently requiring a double face mask mandate, even when traveling to or landing in a country which does not require any such mandate. We felt like we were being governed by a police force when on a domestic flight we, in Row 3, tried to stand and get our carry-on luggage. A flight attendant absolutely refused let us stand, and stated that only Row 1 could stand up at that time. On an international flight, Rows 1 - 18 were allowed to stand and get their luggage, but our Row 22 could not. We have never before seen an airline regulate when specific rows of passengers can get their luggage once the plane is securely docked at the gate. During our travel, Peru and LATAM Airlines required a two face mask mandate in all airports and on all airplanes. When we were returning to the United States, they still required this mandate, even though we were in U.S. airspace and landing at a U.S. airport. This seemed a bit extreme and unnecessary to us, especially considering it is more difficult to breathe with two masks and your glasses fog considerably. We will not be flying LATAM Airlines again, and do not recommend them.

### "LATAM had made a mistake with the pricing of our tickets"
They charged us 336$ when we arrived to make the check-in of our luggage. After 45min of discussion then the manager finally admitted that LATAM had made a mistake with the pricing of our tickets, however if we didn't pay the 336$ additional surcharge we would not be authorized to get onboard the plane. Following this we raised a claim to the customer service, which answered with fake information in order to support their position and then closed the claim.

### "there is a drastic reduction in on-board service"
Not Verified |  Despite the current situation affecting the aviation market, it is not acceptable that there is a drastic reduction in on-board service in the executive class alleging restrictions by COVID19 while internationally renowned companies such as Lufthansa, Switzerland, Iberia, TAP, Qatar, Delta, etc. Many others who operate outside Brazil have normalized their services. Charge $10,000 for a one-way flight and return to Cancun on a plane with traveling seats and even offer a mediocre service such as deciphering passengers who were stupid to fly in Latin America and who next time would have to choose another airline.

### "For what I paid for the flight, I was quite pleased by the value"
Decent flight like most recently on LATAM. Note that no food or soft drinks were served on this or any inter Brazil flight I think still because of covid. Water is available if you ring your call button. I had a budget ticket and middle seats were assigned at check in, which is relatively easy to accomplish online. Plane was full, but flight staff was professional and they worked hard to keep the flight on time. For what I paid for the flight, I was quite pleased by the value. The airline didn't knock my socks off, but would I use them again? Definitely.

### "they could not process the refund"
Terrible experience with LATAM. Bought a ticket a refunded it 10 minutes later expecting that it would be valid within the 24 hour refund period. Spoke to representative. He promised that I would be getting a full refund within 5 business days. I even got an email confirmation. I called back 7 business days later asking why I didn’t get the refund yet. While speaking to another agent, she had no idea what she was doing, and told me to get my refund from Expedia. I kept telling her I booked direct from the LATAM site and not Expedia She then kept me on hold for 40 minutes, spoke to her manager, and told me sorry they could not process the refund. I told them several times that I received an email confirmation, and all they could say was sorry, refund was rejected.

### "rescheduled my flight"
We purchased tickets from LATAM and they canceled and rescheduled my flight. I did not want 40+ hours of layovers on the new flight, they refused any refund and declined my dispute which was within hours of the purchase. They sold the tickets knowing they did not have the flight. They are still selling flights right now they do not have! I was forced to accept the new flight and the next #4 changes in itinerary with no say or consent and charged an additional fee for the changes which i paid to recoup my losses. No help or flights from latam what so ever.

### "Boarding was done fast"
Check in at San Andres airport was a breeze, on the other hand trying to figure out what gate it left on was another story. Boarding was done fast. Service onboard was non-existent due to the pandemic and restrictions by the Colombian Aviation Officials. For a quick 1hr 45 minute flight to Bogota it was okay. Arrival in Bogota was on time. LATAM play was available on your own device so it made the flight go a bit faster and there was a good selection of movies and shows.

### "disappointed with the treatment at the airport"
Extremely disappointed with the treatment received at the airport, no one deserves to be treated like that. My son and I both had the COVID test, because we hit traffic we where literally 10 ridiculous minute late, we were refused to get in even thought we had done all the info online and check in online. I asked to please let me do another test and she said no. I asked to please rebook me to a different flight, different day and “NO CANT DO’. I requested refund, they told. Me only 30% of what I had paid. Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this airline.

### "my flight was late for one hour"
This airlines don't respect thier passengers, my flight was late for one hour, after gathering passengers for boarding they discover that they don't have a staff for this flight, after one hour they call to start boarding again, passenger stand in a queue and they let us waiting for more 30 min.

### "on time and seats were comfy"
Check in online was a breeze, in regards to the carry on bags nobody at the boarding gate complained about the size or weight. Boarding and deplaning was done by rows and did not take long. Due to the pandemic there was no onboard service on either flight. Flights were on time and seats were comfy. On both planes there were ports to charge your phone and the cabins looked pretty new. There was also LATAM play onboard in which you can watch movies on your own device.

### "still have not received my refund"
I bought a ticket on April 24, 2021 with Latam and had to cancel the ticket within the first 24 hours after the purchase. According to their refund policy, I should have been refunded within 15 days which was never done. It is now June 18, 2021 (over 50 days later) and after several emails and phone calls I still have not received my refund. I spoke with an advisor and they want to give me a credit (voucher) so that they can then request my refund. 50 days later, I still have not received this credit (voucher). I am going back to Canada, Latam does not fly to Canada and I will never be able to use this credit.

### "changed our flights soon after booking"
LATAM changed our flights soon after booking, changing our 2 hour layover in Lima Airport to a 24 hour layover, also making us miss our first night or our booking in our resort. We attempted to resolve the issue with our booking agent, and with LATAM staff at the airport, in their call centre but they were unwilling to help us or reimburse us for anything at all. Since when is it acceptable to leave 2 senior citizens in an airport for 24 hours during a covid pandemic without offering any help. To top it off staff at the airport were rude, I could resumed their message to "it's not our fault". I would like to know who's fault they think it is. I filed a complaint with LATAM, but their response can be resumed "I am very sorry you had a bad experience, there will be no reimbursement". Fly with this airline at your own risk, and allow plenty of time for itinerary changes as they appear to be very unreliable and unwilling to help.

### "had to cancel one at a time"
We were unable to travel due to Ecuador going into a country wide lockdown due to COVID beginning 4/23/2021 and supposed to end 5/20/2021. We were to travel 5/1/2021 to 5/23/2021 but because of the lockdown were unable to do so. The hoops you have to jump through to get a refund are arduous as well. I had to cancel one at a time, not the entire reservation. They will not refund to your credit card, only to your bank account. I filed for a refund yesterday and filled out their repetitious forms one-by-one and then they issue a travel voucher and then you have to go through the process again and give them your bank account information.

### "I never received the refund"
I paid full price for a ticket to travel from Campo Grande to Sao Paulo ($151.10). I needed to change the flight's date so I paid an additional $40 for that change. LATAM took the $40, but would not confirm a new seat which means I could get stuck in Campo Grande. This lack of confirmation went on for over a month. After phoning them more times than I can say, they said they'd give me a refund for the $40 change request if I withdrew the request, so I did. I never received the refund. Moreover, when I complained that my original ticket is now worthless because I needed a flight date change, they refunded me $5 for the original ticket. The original ticket was $151.10. Compare with American Airlines where I had to make similar changes -- they refunded me within minutes. I have lodged a dispute with Citibank because I used their credit card to pay for the original ticket as well as the change request. BTW, calling LATAM for help is worthless, and if they file a "case" on your behalf, nothing happens.

### "LATAM is a complete fiasco!"
Not Verified |  I had 3 tickets. I needed to move the date for 1 of them, they insistently said on social networks that the date change could be done on their website, false! Then I called the call-center "in Argentina", they gave me a phone number in Buenos Aires but they answer from Colombia, they hung up the call 4 times, had to buy another ticket on a different airline, they were able to move the date 1 month later. For the 2nd ticket, they simply changed the date without asking the passengers, 2 days before the flight they changed it again. At the airport they didn't accept the PCR test for many passengers, even thought it was right on schedule. For the 3rd ticket they just cancelled the flight 4 days before, no chance for refund, no answers in the call center, no answers in social networks, and what is worst, there's no chance to move the flight to a different date in their website. LATAM is a complete fiasco!

### "Never again, it's not worth the money"
I was thrilled to hear that LATAM became Delta Skymiles partner, so I took a chance to fly them several times in their "Premium" cabins. I typically select window seats in the rear side of the cabin, as I think they are somewhat more private, especially with everyone tending to sit as close to the front as possible. Thus my seat was 5A with no one sitting next to me, and that was perfect. The flight was delayed, and the flight attendants asked me to give away my seat for additional crew required because of the delay and move to an aisle seat with someone sitting next to me. Great touch, especially that there were plenty of vacant seats on the flight. The food wasn't edible at all - they brought a frozen omelet for breakfast. Never again, it's not worth the money.

### "received vouchers which do not work"
It has been several times that I have claimed reimbursement for my plane tickets whose flight has been canceled. The first time on June 4, 2020. Latam advised me that the refund would take 15 days, I'm still waiting! In the meantime I have received vouchers, which do not work: I wanted to pay for my last flights with and they were refused. This company is a company of thieves: they promise and do not not keep their promises. They don't even know how to use a translator and force you to send your request in a language that is not yours. Again the answer to my complaint is that I have vouchers to use (which don't not work!) and if I keep asking for the refund, it will take a long time. Cela fait plusieurs fois que je réclame le remboursement de mes billets d'avion dont le vol a été annulé. La première fois le 4 juin 2020. Latam m'a avisé que le remboursement prendrait 15 jours, J'attends toujours! Entre temps j'ai reçu des voucher, qui ne fonctionnent pas: j'ai voulu payer mes derniers vols avec et ils ont été refusés..... Ils promettent et ne tiennent pas leurs promesses. Ils ne savent même pas utiliser un traducteur et vous obligent à envoyer votre demande dans une langue qui n'est pas la vôtre. Une nouvelle fois la réponse à ma réclamation est que j'ai des vouchers à utiliser (qui ne fonctionnent pas!) et si je persiste à demander le remboursement, ça prendra beaucoup de temps.

### "its been 11 months of nothing"
Not Verified |  You always hear horror stories here and there about flying. I have had the occasional late leaving kinds of things and what I thought was going to be the worst flight I ever took I missed a connection in Toronto once in winter and had to stay in the airport for over 20 hours to catch the next one. I couldnt sleep because of the valuable camera gear in my bag with me I am also over 6 feet tall so when i got on an earlier leaving plane than I was scheduled I did it even though it was a middle seat and I had to put my bag under the seat in front of me. When I got to my destination i could barely walk. I thought that was going to be the worst flight and I travel a ton using at least 3 big trips a year and a couple small ones. Well then I decided to go to Antarctica. I had seen reviews and heard stories but its a once in a lifetime trip so off I go. I planned extra days in cities going down so I could help eliminate all potential problems. Rather than try to get connecting flights i stayed a night in each major city. Going down went fine all went as planned but to get home with lined up flights I wasnt able to do the same plan but I had my flights way in advance was going to the airport like 6 hours early to start and I figured i was set. I did not plan on Latam airlines though. I dont think anyone could plan for such a terrible airline. It started with them overbooking my first flight out of Punta Arenas. They overbooked the flight by 12 people which meant I was missing my connection in Santiago which again would had been with Latam airlines. My checked luggage had been put on my original flight. They had told me someone would be at my gate to help me. Was there? NOPE. Could I find anyone even near my gate when I landed? NOPE. could I get any help what so ever from the crew on the plane? NOPE. I did notice a couple that I had talked to in Punta Arenas was in the same situation. They had befriended someone that lived in Santiago to try and help them. They could speak the language and they took us to place after place trying to get us help. Zero help anywhere. After about 80 minutes of running around the airport with them i heard from my friends. They were staying in Santiago for the night and they thought they had seen my bag behind a desk. I had gone out of security though and couldnt get back in. I dont know how they did it but they sweet talked a guy there and were able to get him to bring it out to me and have me verify it was mine. Frankly I had wrote the bag off. I was out of options so I left with my friends into Santiago. It was about 11:30pm at this time. They had one night booked so the minute i got to airport i was calling the "help" line. after a couple hours all I could do was book a flight the next day with a different airline. My trip cost went up another $1,000 to do this but I was told I would be refunded at least my original cost. Well that was over 11 months ago. I have provided my banking info multiple times, have had countless emails saying it was being worked on and its been 11 months of nothing. I am not a complainer and I hardly give reviews but do everything in your power, stay extra days, take a bus, anything to avoid this airline.

### "Worst experience of my life"
Not Verified |  Worst experience of my life. The day of my trip arrived 4 hours before I found out at that moment that my flight had been canceled. I called LATAM 7 TIMES, the first time he told me that the flight had been canceled and that he did not know the reason but that he could put me on a DELTA flight. when I go to the Delta entrance. He tells me that he had problems and that DELTA did not confirm. At that he told me to wait and I HANG UP the call. I call back and they tell me that I am not registered for any flight. Explain the situation and the guy named Alejandro hangs up the call. 1 hour and 15 minutes had passed and I still had no news of what to do. Like this for 5 times. On the sixth time he tells me one that can put me on a flight for 3 days later. Or that I could wait for the Latam line that opened at 9:04 PM 6 hours later to solve the problem and put me on another flight. Since I had driven 4 hours, I decided to wait until 9 for the LATAM person to tell me that they couldn't do anything and that I should call 1800 #.They did not give me the trip that they had offered me 3 days later because it was Canceled. I asked for a refund and I'm still waiting. La.peor experiencia de mi vida. Llegue el dia de mi viaje 4 horas antes pera enterarme en ese momento que mi vuelo habia sido cancelado. Llamo 7 VECES a LATAM , la primera me dijo que el vuelo habia sido cancelado y que no sabia el motivo pero que podia ponerme en un vuelo de DELTA. cuando me voy a la entrada de Delta. Me dice que tenia problemas y que DELTA no le confirmaba. En eso me dijo que esperara y ME COLGO la llamada. Llamo para atras y me dicen que no estoy registrado en ningun vuelo . explique la.situacion y el tipo llamado alejandro me cuelga la.llamada. ya habia pasado 1 hora y 15 min y aun no tenia noticias de que hacer. Asi por 5 veces. En la sexta ves me dice una que me puede poner en un vuelo para 3 dias despues. O que podia esperar a que la.linea de Latam que abria a las 9:04 pm 6 horas despues me resovieranel problema y me pusiera en otro vuelo. Como habia manejado 4 horaa decido esperar hasta las 9 para que la persona de LATAM me dijera que ellos no podian hacer nada y que yo debia llamar al 1800 #. Aaaa pero que no me dieran el viaje que me habian ofrecido de 3 dias despues por que estaba Cancelado. Pedi un refund y aun sigo esperando.

### "does not care about its passengers"
Not Verified |  I would have liked to provide my ticket or proof of my flights but not even that has been sent to me, Latam has me in limbo, they left to send everything to my email and days of my trip they have not sent anything, only on their page is my route back and what is worse, they arbitrarily canceled the last leg of my trip to get home and sent some text messages, with a link, to my son's phone where he says I can reschedule my canceled flight. Now when I want reschedule the flight on the page there is a message saying "sorry, your reservation can only be rescheduled through our contact center". Try calling the call center and they cut the call. This airline was paid $415 for the date change, it has been impossible to obtain proof of payment from them, now moreover, after having paid them for the date changes, they cancel the last section. I understand that these days in the south of Chile there will be an eclipse of the sun and the flight has not been canceled, the issue is that they have high demand for tickets and they are selling more expensive tickets and what better way to get off the plane than who made the flight change in advance and payment cheaper. This airline is a real disaster, it does not care about its passengers.

### "they simply cancelled her return flight"
I purchased a flight for my mother to the UK under premium economy so she had more leg room. On the flight, this was not granted and was informed by the cabin crew that she could request a tariff refund online. When she arrived, I requested the refund through their customer service channel, and they simply cancelled her return flight. They refuse to have this rectified and told me that I had to purchase a new flight, obviously closer to the date that costs double the amount I originally paid for it. I tried speaking to their customer service over the phone, which are useless. They put you on hold for nearly an hour to get connected, and when you do, after telling them the problem, they put me on hold and simply hang up. I have been trying to through to them for days now, over an hour each time. An absolute on how they treat their customers. Never again.

### "I have not had a response"
At the beginning of June 2020 I bought my ticket to go from El Calafate to Salta with a stopover in Buenos Aires. That same month, they informed me that my flights had been canceled and that, as I had paid with a credit card, they would refund the entire amount within a maximum period of 3 months. It was not true. After the 3 months they told me, I requested a refund through their website, but I have not had a response. I have also tried it through chat and phone but I have only been left on hold for more than 1 hour. 6 months have passed and it is clear that they do not want to return my money, but I am willing to take them to court if necessary. It is a shame that they play with people's money in this way. They are thiefs!!. A principios de Junio 2020 compré mi billete para ir de El Calafate a Salta con escala en Buenos Aires. Ese mismo mes, me comunicaron que mis vuelos habían sido cancelados y que, como había pagado con tarjeta de crédito, me devolverían todo el importe en un plazo máximo de 3 meses. No fue verdad. Pasados los 3 meses que me dijeron, solicité la devolución a través de su página web, pero no he tenido respuesta. También lo he intentado a través del chat y del teléfono pero sólo he conseguido que me dejen en espera por más de 1 hora. Han pasado 6 meses y está claro que no quieren devolverme mi dinero, pero estoy dispuesta a llevarles a los Tribunales si hace falta. Es una verguenza que jueguen con el dinero de la gente de esta manera. Son unos ladrones! !

### "they will not do anything about it"
During Corona, LATAM cancelled the flight 5 times within 2 months assuring our tickets can be rescheduled with no extra charge. Then they reissued the ticket one day before the flight when we didn't even have a chance of being there. Now they are charging us 200 dollars for change of the flight because they say it was a voluntary no show. We have all email proof and approach them about it but they said they will not do anything about it.

### "I keep waiting for the promised refund"
Terrible! I had my ticket cancelled in May due to Covid. It's October and I keep waiting for the promised refund. I have sent numerous emails and even had an official bank transfer receipt 2 months ago. After not receiving anything for a month I opened a new case. I was asked for all the bank transfer details again because it was obviously not done. I can see I am not the only one. Do not fly with them or TAP Portugal, they are even worse. They do not even answer at all! The only decent airline that refunded me was American Airlines.

### "never seen our money back from LATAM"
Not Verified |  This is a company that offers highly priced tickets to Easter Island with 100% refund policy in case of cancellation, while in reality they never pay the rightful amount for our case dated 11/2019 although we went through their tedious refund process, wrote them 20 emails, writing them minimum 40 Facebook Messages and calling them on our cost over 20x. We flown several times with them, and although they had serious issues with the online checking, our last experience with them convinced us avoid them forever. We had two flights scheduled from Santiago to Easter Island and Buenos Aires to El Calafate, both cancelled due to the civil crisis (Contingencia Chile) from in November 2020. Although we had 100% refundable tickets we never seen our money back from LATAM although we initiated this refund process 11 months ago. Our case has the same status since 8-9 months “in payment process” but the money never reached out bank account. They keep telling us that they are working on our case, but their credibility is 0 especially as I have seen that we are not the only ones waiting our money almost one year! They tried to argue that the Pandemic of Covid-19 increased the number of cases they have to process, but we have initiated our refund process 3,5 months before the pandemic started, therefore there is no excuse whatsoever. Worse is that I read on their Facebook page, lots of complaints of same nature, so I concluded that this is usual practice not an accident. Their customer service is a disaster and a total waste of time. Is like hitting a dead end with them! I definitely won’t recommend such a miserable operator. They are a total disgrace especially for using the pandemic as an excuse for their previous incompetence, while our cases has been open since months before Covid times. Stay away from them if you don’t want to lose your money and never see them back!

### "Absolute nightmare to deal with"
Absolute nightmare to deal with. Don’t ever part with your money with this airline. I have been fighting to get my money returned from LATAM Airlines after I purchased flights in Early Jan this year to see my girlfriend in Colombia. (before Covid came about). My flights got canceled in late March and they said they would be offering travel vouchers. To this day I have not received any valid travel vouchers. When they did finally send some vouchers after 3 months, they misspelt my last name (despite providing my passport) and other identifying info. LATAM advised me that they would have to open a new case and it would then take longer to process (despite it being their fault). To this day I’ve not received a single phone call (pretty much 0 contact from them from get go). LATAM finally emailed after I called their NZ number about 50 times. They said that they would provide a cash refund, but I have yet to receive any of my money returned.

### "I still do not have travel vouchers"
Well in my case it is final, I was not refunded even when waiting for six months. For six consecutive months, I'm not able to get a refund (even in the form of vouchers) from the company. Please see my posts below. They are constantly delaying issuing the vouchers without any explanation. They tell you an expected time and at the end of the period they tell you double the time is needed. We lost thousands of USD to them. If you contemplate booking a ticket with them, please be aware of the fact, that in case your flight is cancelled (which is probable scenario these days) you won't see your money again, because they will not refund them. This is based on my first hand experience. I did a voluntary refund in March and I still do not have travel vouchers (not to speak about money refund).

### "should be ashamed of their service"
Still did not receive money refund or voucher. So our case is still not solved, After five months of gross negligence and incompetence by LATAM call center (please read my previous post) they managed to issue some vouchers. Guess what happened. We were supposed to receive vouchers for taxes / fees vouchers in the amount of 160 USD per passenger. They managed to deliver two out of four vouchers. Reason unknown. We were supposed to receive vouchers for 20% of the fare (it was a voluntary pre Covid request) in the amount of 130 USD per passenger. They managed to send them out all but all of them state wrong amount of 10 USD. Reason unknown. Really, everything this company do, they do it wrong. This is an absolute incompetence or an intentional try to rip-off a customer. They should be ashamed of their service even when discounted for Covid circumstances.

### "still did not receive money refund"
We were supposed to fly with this thing in March to Santiago. Due to corona related border closure between Czech Republic and Germany, we were not able to board our flight and we voluntarily cancelled our tickets on Mar 13th. Its five months later and we still did not receive money refund nor a voucher for our tickets. This by the way prohibits us from approaching insurance company and retrieve the rest of the money. Call centre service is apalling. During last five months I experienced passivity and unwilligness to solve our case - refund request mistreated multiple times when operators put wrong or uncomplete data into system - complete unwillingness to give this case some priority after five months - obvious lies or incompetence (constantly changing info bout form of refund and time schedule) - when promised to be called back, it never happened - one operator providing different info from the other I know airlines have a hard time now, but this airline customer service is in complete disarray. They even refused to provide refund calculation so I can take our case to the insurance company to retrieve the rest of the money we spent on the tickets. Im currently in state of awe how arrogant a corporation can be and will never ever board a LATAM plane.

### "frustrated waiting for a refund"
Not Verified | I have regularly used Latam Airlines in the past. After having my flight cancelled on the 2nd May 2020 due to Coronavirus. I am left extremely frustrated waiting for a refund. It has been 4 months now. I keep contacting my travel agency and all they have to say is Latam have authorised a full refund but have not issued the money. I wonder how long they will drag this on.

### "Latam refuses a refund"
My Latam flights were all cancelled by Latam. I made the bookings via Expedia and I contacted Expedia to ask about a refund due to passengers when an airline cancels a flight. Expedia told me that I qualify for a refund but that Latam is not authorizing Expedia to refund any passenger. This is against international regulations requiring airlines to refund passengers when a flight is cancelled. They offer a voucher valid only until 12/2020. I am 78 years old and in poor health. This was to be my last vacation with my daughter. I cannot fly anywhere before 12/2020 and probably cannot fly anywhere in future. Yet Latam refuses a refund. May they cease operations!

### "they charged me once again"
On April I purchased a ticket from Latam and the money into my account was reduced, which, was clear that I was charged for the flight. I received an email from the company cancelling my flight and in the same day I notice that they charged me once again, so, I payed double for a flight that has been canceled. The customer service is terrible, really difficult for them to understand the situation and they need that to prove and error that they executed. For some reason I can’t clarify this into my statement, which makes the story even more confusing. I’m sure I payed for the amount a couple of months ago and now once again.

### "I have had no refund"
Not Verified |  I had a flight booked on the 8th April which was cancelled in March due to the pandemic. As flying is no longer an option, I submitted to have my travel vouchers refunded as cash into my bank account. Once this process was complete, I was told that this would take 30 days to show in my account. It has now been 12 weeks, I have had no refund and each time I call to speak to someone I get told "I don't know". All I want is a time frame and some reassurance but this is not possible from LATAM. I have been patient and understand the situation is out of the ordinary but I am disappointed in the lack of care and follow up from this Airline. I want to support this company but can no longer say I have faith in them

### "the worst flight experience"
LATAM is one of the worst businesses I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. While overseas I requested a change in flights from one of the ground staff and she said this was fine and she would organise that for us. Without letting us know LATAM then cancelled our flights totalling 2.5k dollars. They refused to accept their own staff members mistake and instead quoted us a flight home 3 weeks earlier than we were supposed to fly for another $2k. Then after over a week of back and forth they gave us back 2 of our 5 remaining flights for $1k (meaning we paid 3.5k for a return trip). The staff were unhelpful and the company has policies in place to abandon travellers in foreign countries with no contact information. They also managed to overbook the flight that they eventually gave us and tried to delay us for a day, without offering to pay for accomodation. I have travelled all over the world, through Europe, asia, south america and the middle east and LATAM is by far the worst flight experience I have ever had.

### "never fly with Latam again"
Not Verified |  I have been trying to get my refund since March 2020 when Latam canceled my flight 2 hours before the checkin time. It was not because of Covid 19, it was because there was not enough people in the flight. I drove 600km to get to the airport, lost a day in the road, the petrol money, the Airport parking tickets and Latam simply canceled my flight just like that. I have been trying to get my refund since. I was being patient due to the current world situation but I had enough. This company can not even follow up on emails. Since March I have opened several cases on their website and they never get solved, such a huge incompetence. I will never fly with Latam again. Latam is taking more then a month to reply to the case upload on their system and whey they do reply it does not even make sense. It seems that they don’t even take the consideration to read through your situation.

### "extremely disappointed by LATAM"
I am extremely disappointed by LATAM. I've been trying to upgrade my cabin for more than a week calling and sending requests through the website link and when I get answers, it tells me that I would be contacted within 48 hours to tell me the price, but it never happened. Instead, I received a very rude e mail saying that "First of all you don't have a coupon. second, you don't have points..."  Also, I sent my ESA docs and today I noticed that my case was closed (no e mail to inform, and I don't know the reasons, despite informing the animal's age and attaching ESA letter provided by a Nationally Certified and Licensed Psychologist. I phoned also several times and the costumer service has no answer, neither in Portuguese nor in English options. The only answer is "to wait for a contact within 48 hours (come on, you have an option on the calls "cabin upgrade" and when selected, you don't have the price for the service???? I will have a big surgery in Brazil and I am trying to prepare for my return with a little more comfort due to circumstances, but LATAM is making it impossible. All the aggravation is more than enough to say that this is not a serious company. Buy your ticket somewhere else.

### "avoid business class"
Frankfurt to Sao Paulo. Business Class was a plastic bag of frozen sandwiches, a bottle of water and an apple. No blankets, no bedding, no coffee, no tea, not even a Coke or juice. No toiletries, no wine, no hot food. Nothing. LATAM have discovered a chance to save money in the coronavirus crisis. They charge the same high price, and give you nothing. Passengers were even forced to sleep on the airport floor while LATAM tried to fix their old plane. Please avoid business class, if you have to travel LATAM, book Economy

### "been a stressful experience"
Santiago to Punta Arenas. Traveling with a group of 4 throughout Chile. Chose to travel with LATAM for all 5 flights and it’s been a stressful experience from the beginning! My name was processed incorrectly and the Ms. was added to the end of my first name rather than as the title. That required that I spent additional time checking in and explaining to officials the error. Then, at SCL (Santiago, Chile) for flight to Puerto Natales scheduled to leave at 1120am was overbooked. Two of us were able to board the flight and myself and another passenger were asked to switch flights. The new flight would be the next day. This means that all activities, the car rental and hotel reservation we’ve paid for that day would be lost. After complaining they were willing to fly us out to Punta Arenas and Pay for our transportation to the hotel for the same day. Plus an additional cash credit of $640 USD and food card. Once all of the changes were processed we were given a cash voucher of only $160 USD and we’re expected to arrive to our hotel at 10 pm. After waiting in the airport for at least 5 hours, flying to an airport that’s at least another 5 hours away from our hotel and wasting an entire day of activities that have already been paid for. Not to mention that this has been a trip that we’ve planned for months. The time spent, stress and forgone activities are not compensated by a $160 voucher. The $640 wasn’t sufficient and the $160 was another insult to an already aggravating customer experience.

### "will never fly Latam again"
Not Verified | Miami to Sao Paulo. I have never been treated so poorly by an airline. My concern was not addressed and I was hung up on by the "customer service" agent I received after waiting for over an hour on hold. I was promised to re-book at no cost yet then charged $120.00 to select my Economy seats together. My husband and I are traveling with 2 babies so I need to confirm our seats are side by side but received zero assistance from horrible customer service. I can't believe I am on hold again for another hour just to see what can be done. I paid over 800$ dollars for a ticket now selling for $290.00 only because the only option I was given was to reschedule my flight (originally 4/1 MIA to GRU returning 4/29). This is at least my 6th call trying to find a solution and I feel I was completely taken advantage of and disrespected as a customer. Lesson learned. After flying Latam for many years my family and I will never fly Latam again. We will not hesitate to share this experience with the vast Brazilian community here in all of south Florida.

### "taking advantage of individuals"
Not Verified | Bogota to Lima. This company is taking advantage of individuals during this pandemic and penalizing those that need to cancel flights by imposing a 70% fee of the purchased ticket. I can't believe how a company can be so disgusting.

### "no on-demand vegan options"
Buenos Aires to Miami via São Paulo. Very good flight except for the food and no on-demand vegan options. You really need to progress with the times. Even the salads had fish in them. I will not be recommending LATAM until they update their meal options.

### "staff is very polite"
Iquitos to Lima. This plane was without a business class. The staff is very polite, gave a lot of advice! Food only for purchase, but hot water was given without payment. All liked it.

### "a great level of improvement is needed"
Not Verified |  It is understandable that delays happen, however, what I have experienced at the early hours of 14 March is appalling. Travelling with my family and a small child we have experienced a nearly 2hr delay to wait for additional passengers. It is now 2.20am and we were meant to take off at 12.40pm. I had to ask an attendant for something for our child to eat, and could not achieve a warm meal. There was no perceived care about the comfort and hunger of the existing passengers. Stating, they cannot serve food until they are in the air? Most people would generally be asleep now. I would have expected a higher level of courtesy and common sense given the current circumstances. This experience has led me to believe a great level of improvement is needed. There were other issues I am too tired to describe here. Having flown numerous airlines, we will not fly LATAM again. I am curious to see what the airline company will do, if any, to compensate it’s passengers.

### "treats frequent travelers the worst"
Bogota to Medellin. LATAM is the airline that treats its frequent travelers the worst and I hope that what happened to me will never happen to anyone anymore because they hurt me economically and logistically on Decembrinas dates, I arrived with more time in advance than normal to a national flight so that no inconvenience occurred to me and the airline changed the waiting room along with the boarding gate without notifying me, having my check-in registered at the airport, my email and my phone number, they never let me know. Only when I went to ask why they did not call us on board did they simply tell me that I could no longer board because the flight was closed and that I had lost it. When I claim they deny me that they have changed the room and they treated me super badly at the counter, I went to Civil Aeronautics who did not give me a solution either and in OPAIN they deny the version of LATAM, they indicate that indeed the room was changed and they specify the time .... For all this I have recordings as support, it cannot be that they hurt 5 PAX (3 of them unknown to me) and that the same thing happened to us ... The airline has not responded until today 07-MAR-2020 with a case that I have been claiming since 23-DEC-2019. LATAM es la aerolínea que peor trata a sus viajeros frecuentes y espero que lo que me paso a mi no le pase nunca mas a nadie pues me perjudicaron económica y logísticamente en fechas Decembrinas, llegue con mas tiempo de anticipación de lo normal a un vuelo nacional para que no se me presentaran inconvenientes y la aerolínea me cambió la sala de espera junto con la puerta de embarque sin avisarme, teniendo mi check in registrado en aeropuerto, mi correo electrónico y mi teléfono, nunca me avisaron. Solo cuando me dirigí a preguntar por que no nos llamaban a embarcar me dijeron simplemente que ya no podía abordar porque el vuelo estaba cerrado y que lo había perdido. Cuando reclame me niegan haber cambiado la sala y me trataron super mal en el counter, me dirigí a Aeronáutica Civil quienes no me dieron una solución tampoco y en OPAIN desmienten la versión de LATAM, indican que efectivamente la sala si fue cambiada y especifican la hora.... Para todo esto tengo grabaciones como soporte, no puede ser que nos perjudicaron a 5 PAX (3 de ellos desconocidos para mi) y que nos pasara lo mismo... La aerolínea no ha respondido hasta hoy 07-MAR-2020 con un caso que vengo reclamando desde el 23-DIC-2019.

### "my problem was not solved"
Brasília to Aracaju. They wanted to charge me more than the round trip price to change the date of one of the flights. I tried calling  on the phone, nobody picked up and I was charged on their own customer support service line. Hence, my problem was not solved, got charged extra by the flight and on the phone call.

### "trip was failed from the start"
New York to Guayaquil. This trip was failed from the start. I purchased tickets that included premium business class but when I received the boarding pass the tickets were in economy. This has now gone to a compensation claim. Furthermore, my flight from NYE to GYE was cancelled due to mechanical issues after waiting on the plane for 4.5hrs - I understand things happen and planes break. It would have be nice if the staff figured out what hotel we would be at sooner and actually given us the right information on how to get to said hotel instead of just saying “there is a bus”. Further, after landing at my destination my bags were lost. The entire baggage claim process has been painstakingly slow and a horrible experience. This is first time I’ve had many problems and it’s been the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced.

### "I cannot bring carry on baggage"
Cartagena to Bogota. The staff have no clue what they are doing. I purchased a LATAM+ seat and they still told me I cannot bring carry on baggage. Do these people receive training or they just don't read their own airline policy. Go with Avianca or any other airline when travelling withing South America.

### "staff was very friendly"
Cartagena to Bogota. We arrived at the check-in desk about 1.5 hours before departure and told us that the check-in is already closed!? Anyway, we were brought in front of the line and we could drop our luggage. Overall the staff was very friendly. During the short flight no free drink was offered, not even water.

### "do not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Lima to Los Angeles. We have had so many issues with this airline. We have been flying this airline for about 10 years and the past two years there has been great administrative changes and we have had horrible experiences trying to buy tickets to fly to Peru and Australia. Last year my husband made a group reservation to fly with a group of people to Peru and while we were on vacation in Thailand in March we found out that Latam had not issued the tickets that had been purchased and charged to our credit card for the trip to Peru in June. He had to jump through hoops to get them to issue the tickets because we needed to get confirmation for the flights for everyone on the group trip. Last December 2019 we purchased tickets to fly to Peru on new years vacation and we were not able to pay for the tickets online with our credit card. We had to call a family member in Peru so that they could purchase our tickets in Peru because their system would not take our payment. About a week later we tried to purchase tickets to fly to Australia together. My husband was not able to buy our tickets on the same order he had to buy his ticket separate from mine. Why? Because their system would not accept payment for both tickets online. This is outrageous!!! So, he had to buy both his ticket and my ticket separately. Before we flew to Peru this past December, we checked to make sure everything was ok with the reservations to Australia and long and be hold, they issued my ticked but they did not issue his ticket even though they charged the credit card. So, this is where all the trouble started again with Latam. My husband started calling them asking them why they had not issued his ticket to Australia, they said they would in time, to keep checking back and gave us a case number #21164675. While we were in Peru we went to a Latam center and they said that our case was not important, that they needed to focus on other cases that had flights sooner then ours to Australia. We kept calling and checking with them and we got to nothing. Then they said there was an issue with my husbands member number and told us to call another number to get a telephone code so we could get another case number. Then they said we needed to call their Brazil office to deal with the issue. We kept getting the run around and no answers!!! We were in Peru for a month and all this time nothing was resolved with Latam. They eventually cancelled my husbands ticket to Australia and refunded the money without advising us. But now we are left with my ticket. So we are trying to cancel my ticket to Australia but we get nowhere with this company. Same excuses! they send us from here to there with no solution and I'm so sick and tired of this lack of professionalism and waste of our valuable time. They gave us a case number for this ticket and now a week away from when our flight was, we still have no resolution to this chaos. I do not recommend this airline at all anymore!!! take your money elsewhere. Don't waste your valuable time. While we were trying to resolve this issue in the Lima office there was another lady there with the same issue. for no reason Latam cancelled her husbands ticket to Peru. I have looked on their facebook page and so many people are complaining about this airline not refunding their money. They need to get their act straight. T

### "lies about their reward program"
Sydney to Sao Paulo via Santiago. Latam lies about their reward program with oneworld alliance. They refuse to use the points as they agreement with Oneworld finishes in May 2020. Not mentioning the poor customer service, the luggage missing every flight I've done with them and the lack of communication and internal procedures. they are a mess.

### "Pathetic and quite deceptive"
Buenos Aires to Ushuaia. Paid extra for cabin baggage, priority seating, and seats before hand. The seat I choose was 1A. I did not get priority seating. They did not  have room for my bag up front as it was occupied by equipment( were they not aware when they charged me)!! So I had to put my bag at the back and had to wait for everyone to get off to retrieve my bag. I choose the seat 1A for early disembarkment. Can you imagine how frustrating this experience was. The air hostesses were one of the rudest. Pathetic and quite deceptive in how they charge customers for services.

### "service beyond expectation"
LATAM impressed me greatly. I took a roundtrip flight from Buenos Aires (AEP) to Ushuaia, both outbound and inbound flights were on schedule. The flight was full of tourists. No business class on these flights. Flight attendants provided two beverage services and a snack. Announcements were in Spanish and English. Boarding was smooth. Attendants were pleasant. Our window seats provided dramatic views over Ushuaia. The airline is a member of One World alliance and my status was fully respected. On our return, our tour company misplaced one of our bags and we had to leave Ushuaia without it. We informed the LATAM ground agent in Ushuaia that our bag may have been mistakenly taken by another member of our tour group. The agents swung into action. They got in touch with the tour company. I gave them my address of the hotel in Buenos Aires. When we checked in at the hotel, the desk clerk informed us that the missing bag had been found and would arrive by a later flight at night and LATAM would deliver it to our hotel. It did -- in good shape. It was service beyond expectation. We thought we would never receive it. LATAM's crew in Ushuaia and Buenos Aires ensured our holiday ended on a positive note. Hats off to LATAM - you are my airline of choice to South America!

### "absolute chaos"
Santiago to Sydney. Horrible airline. Flight got cancelled. No explanation given. Hardly any communication from the airline. It took the 6 hours of hell to get to a hotel. A complete debacle. 14 hours later we finally got on a flight. Every step in the process was absolute chaos. These guys are a complete joke and have no idea how to run an airline. Food on the plane is Rick bottom and portions are tiny.

### "ruining my vacation experience"
Not Verified |  This was my first time flying with LATAM and most definitely my last. Our flight from Florianopolis to São Paulo went by with no hitches but when we landed everything started to turn for the worse. My brother and I had arrived at our gate an hour early and made sure to say hello to the worker at the gate desk. Once it got time to our boarding, I noticed no one was at the hate still which I thought strange. I walked up to the worker which is when she informed me that my connecting flight to New York was cancelled and I had to walk across the airport to the LATAM service desk to figure out how to get back home. She said that there was an announcement( in Portuguese) over the intercom. Which astonished me that they didn’t announce it in Spanish or in English considering we are flying back to the states. Once I got to the service desk (no one spoke English) I spoke to someone in Spanish to figure out how to get back home. They said they would but us up in a hotel for the 9 hour delay but when I asked how to get there he said by taxi and they would not be paying for the taxi there and back. It was then my brother and I made the decision to just stay in the airport. The gentleman then said he would give us each a food voucher which we thought was great. Little did we know, the food voucher was only worth $6.50 usd. How could we eat a meal for that much? All I was able to get was a small pox of Pringle’s and a yogurt drink. The time was already 12am and to top it off there were only two restaurants available to us in our terminal that the voucher covered and one of them was already closed. After that fiasco, we finally boarded our new flight to Lima at 3:50am. We got to Lima with no problem at 8am. Bought some breakfast there as we were starving at this point and waited for our flight to LAX which was at 12:15 pm. Once we arrived to LAX and got out of customs, we went to the baggage claim to pick up our stuff and go home. We waited there about 10 minutes till I realized there was a lady with a clipboard with my brothers name on it. It was then that she informed us our luggage had been lost in São Paulo. This was my last straw. I have been visiting my parents from college for winter break, so the only clothes I had was in that bag! She wrote a claim and told us our baggage would be delivered the next night. If we had any problems there was a number and email written that we could contact. So when last night rolled by with no call about our luggage I decided to contact them. The number lead me to where I could only leave a message (not contact an actual human) and there was no response to our email. I called the number on LATAM online page and finally get directed to someone. They inform me that there is a hold on my luggage because I didn’t complete a form! What form did I need to complete beside the claim the woman at lax helped us with! I wrote this still waiting for my bags and still I’m the same clothes from 4 days ago. Feeling disgusting. Please I advise not to fly with this company. I will definitely be spending the extra cash to fly with someone else next time. LATAM thank you for ruining my vacation experience.

### "no padding on the hard seats"
Lima to Santa Cruz. This flight turned out to be one of the worst in terms of passenger comfort. Fortunately the person in front of me did not want to recline, as I only had 1 finger distance between my knees and that seat back. And they only reclined a couple of inches anyway. But much more absurd is there is no padding on the hard seats. Steel or hard plastic, but nothing to cushion your body for a 2½ hour flight (plus boarding, etc. ).

### "will not go back with them"
Cusco to Lima. They do not have any consideration for their customers, they had me waiting in line for almost 30 minutes and there was NO line, NO people. We were just two people waiting in line and still they did not care. Service was rude, they have you waiting and waiting in order to do boarding too. Go with Avianca or any other airline, will not go back with them.

### " Seats were comfortable"
Mexico City to Lima. Seats were comfortable and with enough space, flat bed. Service was careful and friendly. The entertainment system slow and old. Food very bad and insufficient for a flight of 5 hours.

### "I am incredibly disappointed"
I am incredibly disappointed with Latam’s performance and disregard for customer care before my return flight to Munich following a schedule change. After Latam informed me of a schedule change, without specifying details, I was asked to contact the operator Iberia to determine the schedule change myself. Only after confirming the schedule, I was asked to contact Latam again for the tickets to be reissued. My astonishment only grew with the attempt to shift responsibility onto another airline, the refusal to take ownership of the situation, and the request for the customer to manage affairs between Latam and Iberia. One must question the role of Latam in this situation as one expects the agent of travel, with whom the customer book the flights, to take full responsibility for liaising with the operators, confirming schedules and notifying the customers of these changes as early as possible. In this instance, Latam made no attempt to communicate with us nor was any apology offered.

### "No paid food available"
Rio de Janeiro to Salvador via Sao Paulo. Check-in at Rio de Janeiro SDU airport was slow, with not enough counters, and consequently many stressed passengers queuing. Some did not make it. LATAM was able to double prices for Xmas eve period, but did not double staff. I refused today the R$20,00 to chose my seat on the first flight (45mn) and they punished me allocating the last seat, aisle, not reclining, despite the availability of others. Second leg was on a packed a321, extremely narrow pitch, internet connection was out of order, and no meal served (not even a sandwich) for a 2h30 flight at dinner time. No paid food either available. Luggage took 25 mn to be delivered.

### "they are the worst"
Sao Paulo to Frankfurt. This is the second time I fly with Latam and I can tell that they are the worst. I was checking my bags peacefully then a very angry lady did a mistake which they took one bag and left the other bag! Then all what she could say was go to the line and do it manually. Again i will have to stay in the long line. I asked her but why? You already took one bag! She said its ok! I told her but its easy just call somebody to fix it I barely finished!

### "$200 dollars for a checked bag"
Miami to San Paulo. Do NOT fly LATAM airlines. They charged us $200 dollars for a checked bag on an international flight. I have taken several international trips and I have never been charged such an astronomical fee. Upon calling customer service I received rude and short replies, especially from the supervising manager, Andrew. I am extremely disappointed in this airline and do not recommend. I cannot overstate how disappointed I am in the policies and in the customer service.

### "Seats were grimy"
Sydney to Brasilia via Santiago. Ground service started by making us wait in 3 different lobbies before putting us in a extremely full and hot bus that did not depart for another 30 minutes. Why did we need to move from one room to another and then wait even more on the bus? Couldn't they just make us wait the whole lot in one single place and only put us on the bus when it was ready to leave to the plane? Seats were grimy, upholstery is uncomfortably hard and - despite being a small woman, I found the seats to be very small, just as the ones in domestic flights. I found the window technology - where it's not controlled by the person seated on the window sit - very annoying. It is fine to turn it dark after providing the first meal, but not immediately. Leaving Sydney at 10am and having the windows turned dark as soon as the air plane took off was very uncomfortable and unnecessary. They should leave each person to control at least in the first 2 hours and last 2 hours of the flight, when everyone is awake. The food provided was not tasty or enough. Their tiny cheese & ham croissant with a little pot of fruits ARE NOT enough when the next meal will be in 10 hours! And when the next meal came, it was also tiny and hospital-like. They also took 1 hour (counted) to remove the trash! Making our tiny seat space even tinnier since we cannot move with a tray down. Crew on board to the flight Sydney to Chile barely spoke English and I had to talk slow and many times annoying sleeping passengers. Crew from the return flight Chile to Sydney was much better, polite and accommodating. Entertainment is extremely poor. Selection of movies and TV series are small and not many new releases as you'd expect for such a long trip. Also, the TV is smaller than other planes I've flew in.

### "meals on board are not tasty2
Santiago to Paris via Sao Paulo. Staff on board is nice but they mostly ignore you, doesn’t want to speak English. Airline forgets about your pre ordered special meal. Anyway meals on board are not tasty. If you will ask about extra snacks during flight you will get only bread. A350 is comfortable in economy class, enough space for legs and you can easily set your set to half lying position.

### "if you can avoid them, please do"
I should have listened to other reviews, to avoid experience today. My flight was from Baltra to JFK with a connection in Guayaquil. The flight from Baltra to Guayaquil was delayed by 4.5 hrs due to the wind, despite 2 airlines had flew in and out an hr before and 30 mins later. The way they handled the situation was so bad. After being informed in “Spanish” that the flight was delayed, I asked if they could find alternative flights knowing i wont make it to my original flight, I was informed (multiple times by different persons) that the new flight to Guayaquil would be ok, 30 mins after landing would be fine and someone would help walk me to the plane (to make it faster). After all, it was the same airlines and other airlines had done that when the flight was delayed! To my horror, I was told when we landed in Guayaquil that sorry, nothing they could do, and that there was no communication from anyone. I asked the ground staff for the later flight, and I was ok with a connection at Miami, under American Airlines (Same partner), they said they couldnt do that, as it was delayed due to the wind, not their fault, it is too expensive for them to pay American Airlines. They offered airport hotel and issued next day economy ticket to me instead (my original business class ticket). After I asked again, they changed my ticket to business class I was brought to hotel shuttle, I asked multiple times to LATAM staff if the hotel was aware with me checking in and I was assured the hotel would give me a room as soon as I arrived and again not to worry. The meals would be covered also. Sure enough, as soon as I went to check in, the hotel staff informed me that LATAM had not approved the quote yet and I needed to wait (for god knows how long). So I asked hotel staff to come with me to the airport (again) to get this handled, when we arrived the airport, LATAM staff pretended they couldnt understand my English. Thank god I asked hotel staff to come with me to get their approval. My flight is tomorrow, I am not sure if there would be anything else they could make my experience any worse, I think I know the answer to that. One word, if you can avoid them, please do.

### "I'll avoid flying LATAM"
Los Angeles to Arequipa via Lima. We had a bad experience with LATAM. Going from Lima to Arequipa, we were told that a "system error" resulted in our not being able to take the flight scheduled. We were left standing at the counter for almost an hour while they resolved the problem and booked us on a later flight, resulting in a six-hour wait at the airport. Again on our scheduled flight home November 13 from Lima to LAX, we were checking in and (after our bags were sent on the conveyor belt) we were told that a "system error" would not allow us to get boarding passes. We were left standing at the counter while the agent talked on multiple cell phones and then left us without saying what was going on. When her supervisor eventually got into the act, she told us that we had to be re-booked for a later flight at 1:50 am, meaning that we were prisoners in the airport for about fifteen hours. Two other couples we talked to got the same treatment and none of us had our bags waiting in Los Angeles. In future, I'll avoid flying LATAM.

### "insufficient customer service"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight with Latam from Cuzco to Lima on November 13th. Due to weather conditions in Cuzco my flight was cancelled and needed to be moved to the next day. While you understand the cancellation of my flight, it is the insufficient customer service which made my travel experience unpleasant. When the cancellation was announced only 3 employees were available to attend to a crowd of of approximately 100 people. Instead of rebooking the flight directly I was given a customer service number. I strongly recommend that LATAM looks into its staffing and customer service issues. For now I will avoid flying with LATAM.

### "third time my flight is delayed"
Iquitos to Lima. I don't usually write reviews, but seen as there is nothing else for me to do right now, here we go. This is the third time I'm flying with Latam domestically in Peru in less than a week and for the third time now my flight is delayed. I am waiting at Iquitos airport now. My flight was supposed to depart at 2.30pm, it is now 3pm. The aircraft is nowhere to be seen. Staff have no idea when it will arrive. I may miss my connecting flight from Lima to Madrid. You are a joke Latam airlines.

### "been very impressed with LATAM"
I've been very impressed with LATAM airlines. We booked the flights on a cheapo website and had a flight cancelled a few weeks before. I sorted it out directly with Latam who were very efficient. We couldn't change the booking for the QANTAS flight back to Australia. We had carry on luggage and I was impressed that they were lenient in the weight of the luggage we brought on board. It was not excessive by any means. I saw people with some huge bags on board. Our flight from the Galapagos was delayed significantly, so they organised to put us on an Avianca flight back to ensure we made our connections. The aircraft and amenities aren't the newest, but I'm most concerned with getting to my destination. The Latam Play app is really good so its not necessary to have screens on seats. The lounges were really nice, including the sleeping areas in Santiago and Lima. I usually post reviews when something goes wrong, but I've been very impressed this time, enough to post a review! Thanks for making our Galapagos trip really great!

### "get a standard 30% refund"
Not Verified |  Boston to Punta Arenas via Santiago. Totally screwed by LATAM. I was absolutely heartbroken to cancel my solo trip to go hiking in Chile because of violence in fall 19. My hotels etc refunded me no problem, but LATAM was an absolute nightmare to deal with. Essentially, if I had flown Friday Nov 1 instead of Friday Nov 8, or if I had tickets to some soccer game on Nov 23 that had been cancelled, I could have gotten my $1300 back. Instead, I will get a standard 30% refund within 20 business days (great turnaround time!) I must have called LATAM 15 times after poor connections, being dropped from their system, etc. When I finally spoke to a supervisor, he was rude and combative. If I ever fly LATAM again, I will buy every protection that allows full refund, since they clearly have no regard for their customers safety during violent uprisings. Soccer, though, they have GREAT protections for soccer fans.

### "This company is a joke"
Lima to Cusco. This company is a joke. I was traveling with a group of 6 people (all U.S. Citizens). We had confirmed tickets from Lima to Cusco round trip. We arrived early at the airport just to make sure we have time in case we encounter any problems as we are in a foreign country, we preferred to take precautions just in case. Once we arrived at the counter to process our check in they told us our seats had been sold and that we had to wait for the next flight. We were very upset as we had not been notified at all of any changes regardless of the reason. They offered us a credit with the airline of $40 or a cash voucher of $20. We really didn't want either as it was cutting short our much waited vacation which we had look forward to enjoy for a year and now we are being literally forced to cut it short for $20 in exchange. Really.! Anyway, since they did not give us another option no matter how many times we said no, we took the $20 cash voucher. Here comes the worst part ... they told us that we could go to any LATAM agency and that they would exchange the voucher for cash, as the counter at the airport was not authorized to do that. So, we went to the LATAM office in Cusco and they told us that only in Lima could be done. Upon our return to Lima we went to the LATAM agency in Chacarilla, but they told us that they couldn't do it and that we had to go to a different agency in Miraflores. We then proceeded to go to the agency in Miraflores on our last day before our departure back to the US and they proceeded to tell us that they couldn't process the request as it had to be done over the phone. It has been 5 months since that day and in the interim we have been communicating with their "Customer Service" department. We have been changed at least 7 times of representative and every time they ask us for passports, copies of IDs, notarized letters to approve disbursement of funds for our children voucher credit, more questions and more emails. Once we thought we finally were done, and we would finally get our credit they said they needed an account in Soles, which is the Peruvian currency. Now, why in hell would they give a voucher that specifically reads $20 (dollars) if when you redeem it you need an account in a different currency! Anyway, I was able to contact a friend in Peru that was willing to provide me with her account information for the deposit to be done in her account for her then to transfer the funds. LATAM then said that needed another letter approving such transaction, we did, we sent them once again what they requested. This was followed by a response saying that only 5 vouchers will be credited, the other one was missing a voucher number. That was 45 days ago and we still haven't received any credit. I then received an automatic email saying that if I wanted to receive the funds I had to complete their forms again because they voucher was going to expire. Then I email them again asking where my "approved credit" was and they ignored my question by saying please provide copy of passport, ID, notarized letter, etc etc etc etc etc. This is beyond ridiculous and a joke of customer service, I don't do all this for $20, it is a matter of principle. I will forever discredit this company.

### "Disgraceful and breach of consumer law"
Melbourne to Santiago. I bid for an upgrade using LATAMs bid option. The website clearly stated that the card used would not be charged unless I was successful. They charged my card that night, but when I arrived at the airport I was told my bid was unsuccessful. But what would happen with my money? The LATAM representative said it would be back in 24 hours. It wasn't. I lodged a complaint on line heard nothing. I waited three days and then rang. Was told that it was with the right department and they would get back within six hours. They didn't. I just got off the phone with Diego in Colombia who told me in no uncertain terms to go kick rocks and wait 28 days maximum. Disgraceful and a breach of consumer law in Australia where I made the transaction.

### "find I had no reservations"
Booked my Los Angeles to Lima return flights for 2020. Got ticket confirmations. Went to the website to find I had no reservations. Call multiple times - CSR say i never paid, therefore tickets cancelled. Credit card shows payment went through and received by them. LATAM recognizes they have computer issues and they did get paid. LATAM sends final confirmation of flights. I look on the website - no reservations. Call CSRs again (5th time) shows they cancelled tickets and are refunding money. Weeks later - still no refund & no tickets. Nothing! Conclusion - this is a poorly run airline. I will never attempt to fly them again.

### "Absolutely horrid airline"
Not Verified |  Lima to Buenos Aires. The worst possible airline experience. We had several trips booked from Australia to South America, and within South America. We arrived at the check-in desk 3 hours ahead of departure time for our flight from Lima to Buenos Aires. Were told the flight was overbooked, which took about 4 hours in total of standing at the desk waiting for ground staff to explain to us and sort out their administrative problems. Horribly slow and inefficient service, and staff were extremely unhelpful. They proposed hotel and meals for the night and $180USD travel voucher redeemable on LATAM services. Eventually we went along with their proposal and caught the flight to Buenos Aires the following day. Fast forward 10 days later .. we had a flight booked from Buenos Aires to Santiago. I unfortunately missed my flight as I was acutely unwell and taken to the Emergency Department in Buenos Aires. After my doctors consultation, we called LATAM Contact Center to notify them that my partner and I would be missing the flight due to a medical emergency and to please arrange for us another flight to Santiago, possibly the following day. They asked us to provide medical documentation, which I provided my discharge summary from the hospital and doctor’s clinical notes, signed and dated with seal. They had the audacity to say this was not enough evidence, and they could not help us because we were ‘no shows’. They said our ticket was void because was no written documentation of the flight overbooking in Lima. Absolutely horrid airline, would not go back to South America just to avoid flying with them ever again. The staff were unprofessional, inefficient and actually deceitful.

### "$140 round-trip on baggage fees"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Lima. Not a good experience. Had to pay over $140 round-trip on baggage fees for 1 bag, on an international flight. They have no warm food at all. Cold chicken & potatoes, while on a 6 hour flight wasn't tasty at all. Zero in flight entertainment! Better have some movies or good games downloaded on your smart phone.

### "LATAM were mediocre at best"
Lima to Cuzco. LATAM were mediocre at best, even for an on-time and uneventful flight. Legroom was equivalent to what you'd find on a budget flight and planes were also as filthy. Meal service was pathetic. Passengers seem to carry lots of hand luggage and the ground staff seem to enforce the hand baggage rule very selectively (i.e. Foreigners get checked). Expensive as well, as they are one of only 2 carriers flying this route (I believe the other being Avianca). Only consolation is that we were airborne on time and landed on time.

### "company is a disaster"
Not Verified | Madrid to Sao Paulo. This company is a disaster in pretty much every category: customer service, in-flight service, even ticketing! Literally every time I am flying with them I have a problem and/or issue. I wish there were more options and competition between Spain and Brazil.

### "Inflight services are poor"
Bogota to Bucaramanga. Inflight services are poor, uncomfortable seats. The checking app didn't work and the computers too, so had to make a queue for my check in, its not a low cost but they look like one

### "customer service is not functioning"
I purchased a ticket for me and my wife from Puerto Montt to Santiago for 25th December 2018. I made a mistake in the bookings date and purchased a new ticket for both of us in November 2018. February 2019 I started the refund request for the incorrect flight booking. Now 8 months after the initiation of the refund request I still do not have any refund transferred into my account. I paid with credit card, but they wanted my bank account details which I (reluctantly) gave. I have sent numerous reminders to LATAM about the outstanding refund request (with LATAM Case number) but no response. The request case number is still logged as open and I am being asked to be patient since they are dealing with it. In reality, I do not expect any refund anymore. It is small money but needless to say, the LATAM customer service department is not functioning.

### "customer service is trash"
Johannesburg to Lima via Sao Paulo. LATAM's customer service is trash, on my last trip to Peru, on a previous flight months back I was notified about flight cancellation and put on another flight. This time around I arrive in Brasil and ask where my next boarding gate is and my other boarding pass and am told my flight was canceled then I say to the guy "so what now? and he tells me I can be put on the next flight which is 13 hours from that moment meaning 8 additional hours to what I was expecting to wait. According the airline T's and C's are passengers who's flights have been canceled or have been inconvenienced in any way are to be offered refreshment and a hotel stay for a night - I was offered nothing. Then when the flight is boarding 14 hours later yes they postponed it again, I ask the LATAM agent at the gate if my return flights are still in order and he has the audacity to reply "sorry sir I am very busy right now" to which i am so enraged I simple walk away and have all intention of bolstering every bad thing I can scrounge about how horrible this airlines service is. LATAM might be affordable but it is a pathetic airline.

### "inconsiderate to people with children"
São Paulo to London. Very inconsiderate to people with children. There were a lot of babies in the plane I boarded. I’d expected that they put the passengers with babies in seats with more leg room. Instead the exit row seats were full of people who don’t look like they have special needs; people with babies were scattered around the back of the economy (to be precise- one in front of me and another one next to me). I don’t have children but I could feel the pain those parents had to endure during the 12+ hours flights.

### "unhelpful and rude staff"
I bought a flight Queenstown to Bogota, the Jetstar flight from Queenstown to Auckland was delayed 1 hour because of technical problems in the plane. Then we arrived to Auckland and after making us wait for almost 5 hours, our flight was cancelled. Good thing they provided us accommodation but when the bus arrived to pick us up at the hotel to go to the airport, the bus was too small for all the people so we had to wait for another hour to get a new bus that drops us at the airport. We arrived to the airport and we bumped into a queue of at least 120 people. There are only 3 counters available so who knows what time we are going to be able to check in. It's 7am now, our flight is at 8:30am and we are still waiting in the queue. We have another layover in Santiago de Chile to go to Bogota, but the crew says that they cannot do anything if we miss the flight that we need to take in Santiago. There's no point to buy a flight with so much time in advance, if LATAM is not going to be able to sort the issues out. This airline is only queues, disorganization and unhelpful and rude staff. Wasting time in eternal queues in this of airline is a torture.

### "food was not that great"
Not Verified |  Auckland to Sydney. The service was Ok, but the food for breakfast and lunch was not that great. No option given just a sandwich and a small tub of fruit. Flight Entertainment was ok as well but kept getting interrupted by the Captain who spoke to long and slow.

### "very good service"
Not Verified |  Flew Latam Airlines under a Qantas codeshare, return to South America. All flights departed on time. I found the whole experience very easy and comfortable. The flight attendants were very pleasant and attentive, and provided very good service. On a couple of occasions they spoke to me in Spanish presuming that was my native language, but soon realised that I was English speaking and changed accordingly. The food was tasty and consistent (not 5 star), but I wasn’t disappointed. When I flew back to Australia, I was offered tea and coffee and cheese after I woke from sleeping. The bc cabin layout is 2x2x2, which could be a slight inconvenience if you have the window seat, otherwise it was comfortable. I would fly with them again. Note: I also flew Latam from Lima to Santiago in economy. I upgraded to their Space+ seats. Check-in, service and food was very good. Departed on time.

### "Last time flying with LATAM"
Miami to Lima. I am platinum for Life member with American Airlines and flew for the first time with this airline. They didn't honor the One World Alliance with AA. Put me in an regular economy class and our luggage was not tagged Priority as customary with my status unless I was told pay a fee of $50 dollars for a premium seat (more space) . On our way back from Lima to Peru, I called The Platinum Desk at AA and with their help I was able to get an Executive Economy seat and again not priority tag in our bags. Latham is not a true One World Partner of AA. Last time flying with LATAM.

### "I can't recommend this airline"
Frankfurt to Madrid. I am a person living with disabilities. Therefore I requested mobility assistance well in advance of my scheduled flight. I provided government issued documentation to the effect. LATAM confirmed within a timely manner by email and assigned seats in advance, in accordance with German law. When I arrived at the designated check-in desk for the disabled at Frankfurt Airport, the check-in agent behaved rude and unprofessional. He insisted on collecting a surplus charge and tried to deny me my preassigned seat, which is unlawful. I asked repeatedly to speak to the flight manager; my request was outright denied. At this point in time, I could hardly stand any longer. The staff could not care any less. To make things worse, they even canceled out my advance seat reservation for the return flight, for no other reason, but to annoy me and to aggravate me. Therefore I can't recommend this airline to any passenger living with disabilities.

### "profoundly disappointed by LATAM"
Madrid to Frankfurt. After a very positive flight from Frankfurt to Madrid, am profoundly disappointed by LATAM. Delayed my luggage three days (according to them 48 hours) and asked me to take a taxi from Osnabrück to FMO airport because they do not have an arrangement with Lufthansa for baggage delivery. The cost of a round-trip taxi is 175€. I tried to mitigate the cost by renting a car for the weekend (it's 64€ v. renting a car for three hours is 20€ more) and parked the car in my driveway for the weekend. I saved LATAM 111€ yet they offered me only 18€ for the car hire even though they'd agreed to pay for my round trip taxi (the funny thing is that I spoke to a Lufthansa Mitarbeiterin at FMO and she told me that if LATAM had simply asked them to deliver the suitcase - as is normal procedure with delayed baggage across the industry -- they would've made the arrangements and would've invoiced LATAM the cost. I told LATAM that if they are going to land in Germany and delay their customer's baggage they'd better come to an agreement with the German carriers to delivery their misdirected luggage). My ex-husband had convinced me that LATAM has ripped me off and it is better for my mental health to let go of it but I am having second thoughts about filing a court action against them. Until they are corrected, they will continue to mistreat the traveling public. I thought only American Airlines ripped off their valued customers but it must be an industry practice.

### "Very uncomfortable seats"
London to Rio de Janeiro via Sao Paulo. Very uncomfortable seats, entertainment, poor food. Staff okay. The narrow seat has no enough room for the legs and it's extremely very uncomfortable for a long haul flight. The seat entertainment, TV program is really poor. The food taste was really poor without any assortment of salad, etc. Nowadays that's the economy class. Really bad.

### "a good flight and would recommend"
Santiago de Chile to Los Angeles. Second time to fly LATAM in a week. Comfortable seat, smooth check-in, got sidelined for additional security check (with no reason provided). In flight: ok meals - but portions were way too small. Again as previously experienced, not enough toilets in the economy class section (only 4). Pleasant crew, temperature and environment. Landed on schedule. Overall, a good flight and would recommend.

### "good flight experience"
Los Angeles to Santiago de Chile. Overall good flight. Relatively comfortable seats, polite and smiling staff, ok choice of movies. Negative points: inflight meals and toilet availability. I pre-ordered a vegetarian meal - this was not acknowledged until I repeatedly mentioned the request (special meal requests are usually also written on the boarding pass). The meal itself though was the worst I have ever had on an airline. White rice with a few diced tomato pieces and grilled zucchini. Absolutely flavorless, dry, and zucchini tasted of plastic. Toilets seemed to be problematic: only 4 available for the whole economy class, much less than the average - meaning relatively long waiting times for passengers after meals and before landing. Aside these two points, good flight experience.

### "Avoid this airline"
Lima to Tacna. I have been forced to use LATAM for a number of business trips over the past three months, and have to say it has been the worst flying experience I have ever had. Customer service is terrible, and their aAirbus is bottom of the barrel quality. Would never recommend using this airline if you can avoid it. The most recent trip my luggage was somehow lost between Lima and Tacna, Peru. Luggage staff was very inconsiderate and not attentive. After waiting 30 minutes to talk to the baggage claim rep, I was walked from the baggage claim to the ticketing counter and waited another 20 minutes before I was greeted by a separate rep and asked to fill out paperwork. At no point was I given the actual tracking number that the claim was being processed under, and was forced to call a service line later that evening to be given the process by which to track my luggage. I was also informed they refuse the courtesy of delivering the luggage which they lost, requiring a two hour drive back to the airport to claim my luggage, four days after it was lost. Terrible service, worst travel experience. Avoid this airline if possible.

### "I highly recommend"
Sydney to Auckland. Pleasantly surprised!! Paid roughly half of the price as other carriers on this route. After reading horror reviews on here I got a little worried. Although I'm not a huge fan of the Boeing 787, the plane was immaculate. The in flight entertainment selection was great, the service extremely prompt and efficient. In fact everything on this flight was efficient. The boarding order is a recipe all Airlines should do. Landed early. From leaving air bridge to leaving terminal took less than 10 minutes. The sandwich/fruit salad meal wasn't great but I don't fly for a restaurant level meal. Cool touch at the end meeting the Pilot. Maybe I got lucky but I highly recommend.

### "said I had to pay $50 for my baggage"
My husband bought my ticket including one baggage from Santa Marta to Medellín on the website "gotogate" two month ago. But A staff at the check-in counter & a male staff Latam office on 12 August said that I had to pay $50 for my baggage. My husband showed them a screen shot taken from the website that was saying that one luggage was included. Even though he saw the obvious evidence, the male staff at the office wasn't any helpful & not ready to help us and seemed to not wanted to be responsible for our complain. So my husband asked him to call the service center that was in charge of this kind of thing according to the male staff at the Latam office in Santa Marta. But the male call-center staff intentionally hung up the phone four times while having conversation. We couldn't help paying the money otherwise we would have missed our flight this morning. We were very disappointed with the staff & their services & the call guy's attitude. I think that Latam airline has been cheating on people like this. They display their tickets "including one baggage" on the website and then when people actually get to the check-in counter they say that you have to pay for your luggage. I think, that is the way Latam airline rip innocent travelers off like us. I would never ever use this airline again. We've never had this kind of bad treatment from the staff & Latam airline in Santa Marta. I hope that Latam airline will not be one of the One World members.

### "a very pleasant flight"
Not Verified |  Sao Paulo to Frankfurt. It was a very pleasant flight. I was welcomed by the crew when I entered the plane and they were very friendly and attentive. Soon after, they gave me the breakfast menu, you could decide to take a short breakfast, 50 minutes before landing, or a larger one 1 hour and 30 minutes before, it was an excellent breakfast, very complete. You had many options with dinner, it was a very good and you could choose a bit of everything

### "this flight really disappointed"
Flight from Santiago de Chile to Rio de Janeiro with LATAM in Economy class on an A320. I had taken LATAM before and had a positive impression, but this flight really disappointed. The seats felt really tight and were rather uncomfortable for a 3+ hours flight. Moreover, I had ordered a special meal, but LATAM failed to load it. However, looking at my neighbours' meals, I did not feel that I missed all that much. Next time, I would not go out of my way to fly with LATAM, but rather look for alternatives.

### "Was pleased with this company"
Was pleased with this company: upgrade from Frankfurt to Madrid and was admitted to the AC Maple Leaf Lounge - not a very nice club but a nice gesture. Catering and service aboard the flight was excellent, however I do not understand how a new airplane - Boeing 787 - has seats that do not function. My first seat in row 1 had a faulty entertainment system, so I gathered my things and moved to row 3 -- there, the seat did not recline or move at all. I declined to move a third time. Return flight not so good. The agent at the priority check-in (am AA Platinum) insisted that I pay 10€ to have my suitcase wrapped in plastic b/c there was an exposed edge on my suitcase and he said it would damage other suitcases in the hold (a first for me after 40 years of flying). I waited 75" at Frankfurt Airport and no suitcase. There was another suitcase similarly wrapped in the claim area and the agent thinks that mine had been taken home in error. By the time i'd made the report (I'd warned that agent after 75" of waiting that I had a train to catch) I rushed to the Fernbahnhof but missed my train, and so had to grapple with the Deutsche Bahn staff to be put on the next train which had me home three hours late. I tried to access the Latam site as quoted on the claim receipt (LATAM.com/BAGAGEM) but that page doesn't exist. Called the phone number on the receipt but the recorded message told me to go to the airline's webpage (now that's certainly not getting anywhere). So, I am here in Osnabrück for my ex-husband's 60th birthday party (a formal catered affair at a fancy hotel) with nothing to wear and what's worse is that my medicine is in the suitcase. Will I ever see any of this or will it all end up in small claims court? Again, apart this baggage issue LATAM far superior to American Airlines, whose staff would rather spit in your eye and call the cops to arrest you if you question them or even ask a simple question.

### "the staff was friendly"
Not Verified |  Medellin to Cartagena. The flight was on time, the staff was friendly, even the service hotline tried to help me when I was delayed on my way to the airport. They offered free drinks on the fligt

### "only positive things to say"
Had a connection in Miami after flying from NYC LGA. I booked my tickets through American Airlines because Latam is a partner. I printed my boarding passes off the American website. My flight to Miami went fine. We had a 1.75 hour ground time to connect. We landed in Terminal D and our Latam flight departed in Terminal H. We gave ourselves 30 minutes to walk from Terminal D to H. We went through the TSA precheck line and when they scanned our boarding passes the boarding passes were rejected. Security told us we had to go back to Terminal D for American to print out our boarding passes. Our Latam flight was departing at 5:24 and it is now 4:50. So we ran to Terminal D and after talking to an American agent we were told that they could not print our boarding passes because the flight was on Latam and that we needed to go to Latam in Terminal J to get our boarding passes. We ran to Terminal J and it is now 5:15. We scanned our documents at the kiosk that told us the flight was closed. We spoke to a Latam ground agent who understood the problem. She walked us to a ticket counter and, in Spanish, explained the problem. It was now 5:20. The ticket agent printed out our boarding passes, walked us to the security, had security rush us through and we ran to the gate for our flight arriving at 5:24. The gate agents asked for our passports and waved us through. The aircraft crew was very accommodating in helping us store our luggage, escorting us to our seats and providing beverages to cool us down. The flight departed on time and the flight to Lima as very pleasant after such an awful experience on the ground. If it has not been for the ground and gate staff we would never had made the flight. This is a review for the airline because there have been some very negative reviews and this traveler, flying Latam for the first time, has only positive things to say about my experience with Latam.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Had the 12:15 a.m. non-stop flight. Check in and baggage drop was very efficient. We boarded on time and departed Lima on schedule. The announcements in English were very clear and thorough. There was plenty of overhead space and crew was very accommodating in helping passengers lift their luggage. Our flight departed on-time. The onboard entertainment system has many offerings and easy to navigate. Seats comfortable with plenty of legroom. I am 6'1" and was comfortable. They provided blankets, pillows and headsets. Beverage service provided shortly after reaching cruising altitude. And food service came shortly afterwards. The flight was smooth and pleasant. I read many not-so-positive reviews of Latam before booking through American Airlines. I was pleasantly surprised by the courtesy of the crew, the amenities provided, the entertainment choices, the comfort of the seats, the cleanliness of the toilets and the overall experience. I look forward to flying with Latam in 2020.

### "most wonderful experience"
Santiago to Miami. I had the most wonderful experience with LATAM. The boarding process was punctual, friendly and efficient. I wish I would’ve known I couldn’t carry water on the plane, even though it was purchased at the airport. The flight attendants were were friendly, accommodating and respectful. The entire experience was wonderful. The leg room was super, I was able to spread out which is not something I do on most airlines. I was very impressed.

### "flight was canceled"
❎ Not Verified | Johannesburg to Lima via Sao Paulo. Checked in at O.R Tambo and was told that they were unable to print my second boarding pass and said to ask for it at LATAM in Sao Paulo. Got to Sao Paulo and went straight to LATAM - the flight was canceled and I was in no way forewarned, my layover was pushed from 5 hours to 6 additional hours and then it got pushed by an additional 3 hours - a 14-hour wait. None the less I arrived in Lima (which is my second home country) many hours later than previously planned. I have never experienced bad service from LATAM ever, and now I got this! When I went to LATAM in Sao Paulo they didn't even offer any hospitality for rest nor did they provide any eats or beverages. Jeepers creepers did this tick me off to high heaven. Then about 40 minutes before the flight started boarding I wanted to make sure the return LATAM flight was not canceled and the gentleman attending to me had the audacity to tell me " Sir I can't help you right now I am busy". How hard is it for an airline that factually rakes in millions of USD per month to show a little decency? I will be contacting them within the next few days to see how my refund is coming along. I am a frequent flyer and this was the worst I have ever experienced and to be honest, I was very fond of LATAM, it was my wife and my preferred airline.

### " refund is still not done"
Not Verified |  Due to work related reasons I could not fly and well in advance I requested a refund of my fares for an eligible refundable ticket It has been over two months of frustrating calls, visits to the Sydney office and the refund is still not done. Every call is logged, a case created to find the case is later closed with no resolution They took two months to advise they had issues with their refund process to only then request another account details... still no refund I would not recommend this airline to anyone that just wishes to have a peace of mind of knowing that if changes in your plans arise you would be able to get a refund.

### "secrecy about flight connections"
Not Verified |  Montevideo to Cusco via Lima. Staff were sort of kind but of course, there is always a priority to people who speak Spanish. If you do not speak Spanish you have to wait. Also, due to a delay I lost my connection and the staff kindly informed me that they cannot contact their colleagues at Lima to give me another flight and I would only know whether I make it or not once I arrive in Lima. What an adventure. Delay was due to the weather but people come on, you could have provided a meal to all of the passengers here. Also, what is with all the secrecy about flight connections? Pity, it looked like a nice company to fly with.

### "nothing but empty promises"
Ushuaia to Buenos Aires. I purchased two tickets on LATAM Airline for an April 30, 2019 flight. The flight was canceled because of a national transportation strike. I was promised a refund for my two tickets within 20 business days. At the end of that time, I called and a ticket was submitted on my behalf (their procedure) to find out why I hadn't received my refund. They said it would be 10 more business days. At the end of 10 business days, I called back and they told me all they could do was submit another ticket. I went on their social media page and complained and they told me they were submitting another ticket. It has now been 77 days and I have nothing but empty promises. I have also had the misfortune of reading many other people's stories who have been waiting longer than I have, some more than six months with the same formula, the refund is "in process. Ironically, the canceled flight to Buenos Aires caused me to miss a connecting flight to Santiago, Chile via Sky Airline. They refunded my money for that flight!! If you have a choice, choose Sky over LATAM, or take a bus. Dishonest company.

### "praise customer service staff"
Not Verified |  Return flights from Santiago to La Paz - both left on time and had exceptional helpful check-in & cabin crew but what I wanted to praise mostly is the customer service staff. They go out of there way to deal with requests for changes, far better than any airline I have used in the past.

### "customer service is hopeless"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Bogota via Santiago. We had purchased our tickets six months prior to flying. The flights were selected for best time of departing, and shortest length travelling time. Departing Melbourne at 8 pm. At some point during the interim, LATAM rescheduled this flight, and the return flight, allocating us completely different Itineraries. However, they did not, at any time, contact us to inform us of the rescheduled flights, or changed return itinerary. The only way we found out was an email sent the night before, informing us that the flight was delayed a few hours. Instead of leaving at scheduled time of 12.45pm, it would be leaving a couple of hours later. This was the first time we had received any idea that the departure time had been rescheduled from 8pm to 12.45pm. I rang LATAM immediately after checking our booking, having found it different to the flights I had booked. The outward bound journey had us in Santiago for ten hours; the return flight, in particular, was a dog’s breakfast that had us making three stops on the way home, over several days, and then stranded in Sydney. LATAM were able to change the itinerary for the homeward flight, after a lot of explaining and complaining on our part, but have refused to apologise or acknowledge any wrongdoing at all. We will never book flights with LATAM again. Their customer service is hopeless. They have no accountability or responsibility or care. All it needed was one email to ticket holders when they decided to change the flight several months after we booked. The distress we experienced over this was enormous; if the flight had not been delayed, we would have been none the wiser, and we would have turned up for our 8 pm flight, only to find it had already gone. We had visits organised on our way to the airport, to visit family and grandchildren before going away for five weeks. We had to cancel these, which caused stress and upset to everyone.

### "the most horrible customer service experience"
Not Verified |  Boston to Sao Paulo. This was the most horrible customer service experience (with LATAM) I ever had in my entire 58 years of life. I have been a devoted American Airlines customer (a member of the 1 million miles “club”), and thought LATAM would be the same level of services. From this experience, I will never call, set foot, or fly LATAM for the rest of my life; and, will make sure my family, friends, and business relationships I have do the same. LATAM never more. PS: The issue was around a medical emergency and rescheduling my return (and my son) back to USA.

### "would never recommend"
Not Verified |  Disgusted with the horrible experience with Latam, would never recommend. We were on a connecting flight using the same airline we’re the first flight was all on time. Upon running through the airport to try and board out next flight they would not let us on the plane (which had 30mins till take off). When asked why we can’t board the staff said “It is our policy that passengers cannot board the plane without their baggage also in the plane and our baggage supposedly had not been loaded onto the plane. However, we later found out all baggage on connecting flights gets loaded directly onto the next plane no matter the circumstances, and our baggage had left. We were left for an extra 24hrs with no clothes, toiletries or anything as well as lost wages from work we planned on attending. In return for the inconveniences we received absolutely nothing. Not even when we repeatedly tried for something as a seat upgrade.

### "cannot praise this airline enough"
We flew from Madrid to Frankfurt on Latam. I cannot praise this airline enough. The crew were attentive with a warm and genuinely friendly demeanour. We boarded on time and were lead to our, two abreast, seats in the middle of the aircraft. Upon taking our seats we were offered Champagne or water and a bowl of nuts to nibble. The seats were similar in layout and operation to other airlines such as LOT and offered the option of a full recline into a fully flat bed. The pitch was more than adequate. The TV was operated either by a handheld controller or by touch screen. The selection seemed fine (although I didn't take advantage of it, my wife managed a movie). We were taken back onto stand because of a late slot amendment owing to weather at Frankfurt. This delay was minimal however it did allow the cabin crew time to ply me with another cold Champagne (as a former Air Traffic Controller I abhor delays, however with Champagne, not so much). A short taxi and departure from one of the southeasterly runways and we were up. The lunch service started soon after take off. The food was very pleasant. A nice shrimp salad with a curried mayonnaise served with a fruit bowl and cheese course. It was washed down with a few glasses of very tasty Chilean white wine. Coffee was served in a large cup! Thank you for that, (I hate teeny tiny cups of coffee) and more wine or cold drinks were offered. I took advantage of stretching out and woke up on descent into Frankfurt. The whole trip was just over two and a half hours. I cannot recommend LATAM high enough.

### "I missed my first flight"
Sao Paulo to Salvador. The company is extremely unreliable and I don’t recommend it. I booked 2 flights to go to 2 different cities. I missed my first flight. The agent told me that I could take the following flight if I pay 155USD with him over the phone. He said my credit card wont work (although it was perfectly working and my bank confirmed no purchase tentative has been made). The agent told me to go to the airport and I could pay There. I showed up to the airport and the agent told me the flight is overbooked. I spoke to 3 different agents to confirm that if I manage to go to the other city I could take my second flight free of charge. I asked them to send me a confirmation email they said no need and gave their name as a reference. Now I'm stuck in Salvador and they won’t let me take my second flight.

### "are so clueless and disempowered"
Johannesburg to Buenos Aires via Sao Paulo. Disregarding the fact that just about all of our routes were delayed, our luggage was mishandled and lost en route to Buenos Aires. Although the wait was quite long reporting the luggage hadn’t been received at the airport, the ground staff were quite helpful. We received an allowance for the day which would have been fine if it wasn’t for one of the large denomination notes being an unusable counterfeit. We’re a family of four, traveling with a one year old and a four year old, none of our checked in luggage made it to our destination. In fact, it took three days for us to be re-united (fortunately) with our luggage. Having travelled extensively, I’m aware that airlines allow for compensation to travellers who purchase essentials (Clothes and cosmetics), should luggage be delayed or lost. I made sure I retained all slips of such items purchased. All seemed fine and my claim for this compensation was lodged in mid January 2019, not an insignificant amount given this was for the whole family for three days without any of our luggage. In the months since then, I have experienced nothing short of #incompetence, neglect, lies and deception from LATAM Airlines. It took a month before a formal letter for settlement for the claim was received, which was laughable in its value in relation to my expense which was well within the Montreal Convention provisions. The staff handling the case were so disorganised, they misplaced the proofs provided. After several promised deadlines were missed I then received a reasonable settlement letter which was signed and I was advised that payment will be fulfilled within 20 days. This after queries from staff suggested they had no clue on how to actually fulfil an international funds transfer. Unsurprisingly, a full month later (End March 2019), no payment was received. It took another month until early May for the airline to acknowledge an apparent system issue and advise that payment will reflect in a further 20 days. Don’t bother trying to get any information from their call centre, they are so clueless and disempowered, it actually got to a stage where the agent I was talking to could not help me or put a supervisor / manager on the phone. There was no further course of escalation, only a “note” on the system for the relevant department to contact me, which they never did, for weeks! No prizes, for guessing, the second official settlement advice and a further 20 day period elapsed with no payment received. We are now in June 2019, almost six months after the claim and more than three months after a legally binding settlement letter was received and agreed. What a shameful disgrace of an organisation. In an industry where efficiency and Customer Service are paramount it is a surprise that LATAM has survived. Fortunately, there are several options for air travel in South America, do yourself a favour and entrust a different carrier with your trip!

### "delay for more than an hour"
Easter Island to Santiago. The flight was delay for more than an hour but the airlines did not make any announcement nor apologies to guests. Flight entertainment was poor. We got connection to another destination with Latam but luggage could not go through to final destination we had to pick up the luggage and check in again

### "I would use them again"
Río de Janeiro to Iguazu via Sao Paulo. Had no issues whatsoever with either the flight or the luggage or the check in process. Carried hand luggage only. Found the staff to be pleasant and professional. We left on time. Most importantly they got me there safe and sound. I would use them again.

### "seat didn't work"
Santiago de Chile to Sao Paulo. Old aircraft. No livery and the body of the B777-200 was all white. No explanations given. Business class seat didn't work and was very dirty. No IFE, odd food and just a a tray with cold cuts and minimal portions. Full flight wit long queues on the lavatories because 2 of them was out of service. Rude crew with non sense answers for simple questions. Curious that on this route they use to fly an old 787 and until 20 hours of the flight LATAM´s website was showing this very aitcraft, 3 hours before the flight they have changed in there.

### "not such a pleasant experience"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Lima. Flight departed on schedule, but it was generally not such a pleasant experience.The cabin crew never offered headsets, and although they were fast and efficient with the meal service, they acted notably miserable. The legroom on this particular plane was terrible - it turned the last 6 hours of the flight into torture. The quality of the food and drink was ok.

### "first experience missing a flight"
Yesterday, I was going to fly from Boston to Sao Paulo on Latam. The flight was leaving at 5:30 PM and I used the Logan Express bus from Braintree leaving there at 2:40 PM. It is only 10 miles to Logan, but I did not arrive at the airport until 4:45 PM. There was no one at the counters, so I called the "customer service" number to explain. There were 5 other passengers who also  arrived late. Customer service took 45 minutes to see what they could do for me. The flight the next day did have space. And to change the ticket to the next day would cost $7,910. Considering my ticket cost $1,600.00 I thought this was a mistake. No mistake. I opted for not flying with Latam the next day. Will apply the $1,600 paid for the ticket to another flight on them in the future. It is unfortunate they do not have someone at the airport to speak with directly. This was my first experience missing a flight. I thought there would be a better plan in place for this situation. How many people would pay or could pay an additional $7,910 for arriving 15 minutes late. The solution for me was to call American Airlines and they were able to get me on a flight 2 days later for a reasonable cost.

### "poor customer service"
Bogota to Santiago de Chile. The most disgusting and poor customer service I have ever experienced. Flight delayed 4 hours then cancelled at 2am in the morning with little to no explanation or concern. Forced to get up at 6am only to be told we would not be on another flight until 17 hours later. Missed international connecting flights with an English speaking attendant ignoring us and saying she does not understand English. A further 2 hours to check back in. Was then given a travel voucher only for all three of our party to be missing the last number on the printed travel voucher. Once back home in Australia we tried to claim expense of the voucher with incompetent staff who would pause and not answer a question that was asked for minutes at a time. Finally after much heartache was told the transfer was complete and would take no longer than 15 working days to show up in account, never showed up. Called/emailed multiple times to follow up only to get transferred to an alternative team member and told my case was still getting resolved. 4 months later no money has been transferred. Easily the worst experience i have ever had to endure in not only an airline but any form of customer service.

### "awful customer service"
Santiago de Chile to Cusco. They have awful customer service, they charge for everything. Staff is unfriendly and rude, I had a couple of issues in Lima and Santiago with the staff on ground. They were threatening me 40 min before the scheduled time to leave me if I did not board the plane immediately even if the boarding pass said gates closed 20 minutes before flight. I explained the staff that my elderly mother was at the restroom and that it was still early, they guy was threatening her to leave her on ground if she did not board the plane. Once we boarded the plane, the gates did not close until 20 minutes after, and when we were ready to take off the captain said theres was an issue with the aircraft, we had to wait almost 3 hours on the plane with very little information about the issue, until finally the plane took off.

### "Not the service they claim"
Iguazu to Sao Paulo. Not the service they claim they have online. We had to wait for the staff to go to the check in counter because they will not help if is not 2 hours prior, very strict. Boarding was a nightmare! They opened aft and fwd doors and everything was confusing, people boarding from the back when their seats are in the front and vice versa, staff would only speak Portuguese and no English whatsoever. Passengers helping crew to translate to English or Spanish. Onboard everything was expensive for the small size it was and a bit outdated plane. Staff seemed to be rushing and not really helping. Entertainment was just ads.

### "cancelled the same flight"
Mendoza to Sydney via Santiago de Chile. Two times in a row, they cancelled the same flight. I paid extra for a flight with a certain duration, and it ended up lasting double the time. I offered them solutions by sending me on different flights that had space, but they said they couldn't do that, that they couldn't send me with other airlines (after two nights at airports, the next flight was with the airline I suggested two nights before). Their personal don't care about what happens, and nobody takes any responsibility on the matter.

### "missed = meal as I was sleeping"
Santiago de Chile to Melbourne. Flying for 15 hours they provided two meals. I missed the first meal as I was sleeping, when I asked them to provide it they said it couldn't be done because they were preparing the breakfast. When the breakfast came the options for me were with ham, which I cant eat because of my religion.

### "very welcoming and professional"
Auckland to Sydney. Check-In was super quick as there was no lines, but once I reached security it took way too long plus it did not help as I wasn't given an express path pass. Boarding was early which I find efficient as an on time departure is promising. The Cabin Crew were very welcoming and professional, a much better experience than the last time I flew with Latam. Catering was mediocre, a menu was available but there was only two options for breakfast and everything tasted decent. The IFE was good, enough to keep you entertain for a 3 hour flight but any longer and you may get slightly bored. Lastly, the seat was very comfortable even though it's an older product compared to what's available on their 787-9 and A350 fleet.

### "no intention of reimbursing"
LATAM owes me US$250 for destroying my suitcase. They committed to this in writing in Novermber 2017, and after more than 400 emails back and forth, have yet to pay me LATAM is a wonderful airline if your trip goes well, but the worst airline in the world that I have dealt with concerning any issues. I honestly believe they have no intention of reimbursing me, and provide no recourse/escalation process when problems are encountered. There is no one to call (on an 800 number), no one else to whom I can provide my information, and no resolution. I will do my very best to never fly with LATAM again, and suggest you try to do the same, if possible.

### "crew was basically rude"
Lima to Los Angeles. 55 minutes before boarding they started calling about 15-20 of us by name to the gate desk. LATAM changed my seating assignment 3 times within 25 minutes then ultimately assigned us to the same seats we had reserved 30 days ago. Got to the seats and two people were already in them. We had a stand-off onboard. The other people got moved since we had paid for the upgrade and they had not. They kept shuffling other people’s seats until about 3 minutes before closing the plane doors. Have never seen anything like it in the 40+ years we have been on planes. The rest of the flight was fine except the crew was basically rude. I pray we never fly Latam again.

### "not be using LATAM again"
I had a very bad experience with customer service. I bought two tickets for my older parents. They found out the flight was canceled at the airport, and had to take an 8-hour bus to get to Sao Paulo. The gate agent told me to fill out a form online to request a refund. When I did so, they only refunded me partially. I called and spoke with 3 different people at LATAM about it, and they told me that I requested a refund through the "voluntary option" meaning I filled out the form incorrectly. When I tried to explain that there isn´t a way for me to click on the involuntary option, the last agent I spoke with was very rude and continued to blame me. Even when I tried to reason with him, he got irritated and said I couldn´t even receive a voucher or anything to receive compensation. I will not be using LATAM again.

### "Easily the worst airline "
Ushuaia to Buenos Aires. Easily the worst airline I've ever experienced (as an American, that is saying a lot, given the terrible airlines we have in the USA). The female agent and her male supervisor at Ushuaia on the early afternoon of March 23 forced us to check in all of our carry-on luggage based on balancing "weight" on overhead compartments-- on an A321. (By the way, this was the first time this has ever happened, including other Latam flights). They forced my wife to move over when she was repacking her suitcase to accommodate another passenger (the other passenger, a typically kind Argentine, was the one who apologized to my wife - not a Latam employee). The ride was atrocious - no food available apart from a flimsy bag of dry crackers, flight attendants who literally heated full meals while in-flight for themselves while the entire cabin was in the middle of a 3.5-hour ride starving, and the flight attendants were basically not doing anything. I can't believe I am saying this, but choose Aerolineas Argentinas. They are also terrible but at least not abusive at the front counter. Final note: I emailed Lan about this. Of course, they didn't respond. Big surprise.

### "quality of LATAM is low"
Sao Paulo to Santiago. The quality of LATAM is low, nor compared to Lan from a few years ago. The service on board is not friendly with the customer, the food is the lowest point of the journey. A basic meal with a dessert sweet! The seat is comfortable, and boarding is normal. ES: La calidad de Latam es baja, ni comparada con Lan de hace unos años. El servicio de bordo es poco amigable con el cliente, la comida es el punto mas bajo del trayecto. Una comida basica con un bonbon de postre!!! El asiento es comodo, y el embarque es normal.

### "high service-level"
Sao Paulo to Madrid. I want to thank LATAM for a great experience and high service-level. We have experienced a great service on the ground, in the sky and in the LATAM Lounge in São Paulo. Our in and outbound trip has two stopovers. We were afraid that our baggage should not reach the final destination at the same moment as us. But also here everything went smooth! Many thanks! For my next trips to South America in the future I shall book LATAM again.

### "kept getting delayed"
Orlando to Rio de Janerio. Horrible flight kept getting delayed and there was no communication. Absolute nightmare we would get an email that would say “we will update you in 2 hours” and then I’m 2 hours they would send another saying “we will update you in another hour” it’s 1 am in Orlando, I’m far from home (Philadelphia) wondering if I will miss a whole day of my trip. Wasting money on a room I booked, missing valuable experiences. I am distracted. LATAM has not offered refunds or upgrades. I travel a lot and this is the worst experience by far.

### "Worse customer experience"
Aruba to Bogota. My girlfriend is Dutch, i am French, they refused us the boarding without buy an exit ticket. I previously flew without issue, the hostess manager told us to buy a scam ticket with wingo and ask a refund which cost us 60$ . Worse customer experience, stressful and they scam you to an other airline.

### "LATAM has declined"
Madrid to Santiago de Chile. My experience is bad. Latam has had a decline over time. Flight of 13 hours is made long since starting the service on board is scarce, the food is little considering the hours of travel, it is of good quality but scarce. The entertainment is good, The plane is clean. Unfortunately one of my suitcases did not arrive in Santiago de Chile and it took a week to arrive, and when I arrived was broken, without wheels and items missing. I think the quality of LATAM has declined over time. ES: Mi experiencia es mala. Latam ha tenido un declive con el tiempo. El vuelo de 13 horas se hace largo ya que comenzando el servicio a bordo es escaso, la comida es poca considerando las horas de viaje, es de buena calidad pero escasa. El entretenimiento es bueno, El avión está limpio. Desafortunadamente una de mis maletas no llegó a santiago de chile y se demoró 1 semana en llegar, y al llegar estaba rota, sin ruedas y me habian violado el sello y me robaron pertenencias de la maleta. Creo que la calidad de LATAM ha disminuido con el tiempo.

### "a low cost airline"
Frankfurt to Sao Paulo. Cabin Crew was friendly but service, food & beverage were below standard. It is clear that the service provided in the past by LAN or TAM do not exist anymore. LATAM is a low cost airline and only if you get really cheap tickets I will recommend to buy it.

### "appalling customer service"
London to Sao Paulo. We booked a holiday to Buenos Aires and Rio using Latam flying business class. The flight out was satisfactory but returning home was a nightmare. Although our seats had been booked and paid for months before, we were told that my wife and I could not sit together. Prior to this, the check in female had been asked if there was a problem and we were told NO. When we stated that this was not acceptable we were dismissed with a take it or leave attitude and told that the seating would be sorted out at another Latam desk. This continued until we were at the boarding gate where we were assured that the seats would be together and return in 30 minutes to find out. On return nothing had been sorted and we were told to board the plane and stand by the seats we should have had. A member of the cabin crew approached us and said that she had found two seats together in another part of the plane. All along the line from one desk to another we were dismissed and lied to making us out to be the trouble makers. Making matters worse was the fact that the seat which we had booked months ago was given to another passenger who only booked it 3 hours before departure and he was prepared to move but was told he could not by the cabin crew! Do not expect to get what you paid for or have any help from any Latam airline staff. If there is an alternative airline, travel with them. Our travel agent complained on our behalf as did the two reps we had on the holiday and it has taken from November to March to get nowhere with them. No communication, explanation or response. Totally rude and appalling customer service.

### LATAM Airlines customer review
Auckland to Sydney. I was truly surprised by the business class cabin on Latam. It has lots of space between seats. you do not have a lot of privacy..their lay out is on a 2-2-2 configuration. it is very spacious. The cabin service was attentive. The crew gave us his name it was a nice touch. The food was fine. I would not recommend their seats if you are a solo traveller.

### "not a good airline"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Lima. Not very pleased with this airline, very poor services in South America (Peru). The flight back got canceled sent us to hotel without paying, after I had to call my wife to get in Latam website to find me a returning flight because LATAM in Peru don’t help, the hotel was not paid by LATAM, so my opinion not a good airline to fly to South America.

### "will avoid flying LATAM"
Santa Marta to Bogota. Hated the LATAM ticket and boarding from SMR. First they asked me for 100.000 pesos, then when i told them that i work at an  airport they changed their mind. They underload my hand baggage while there was people with very bulky items. I will avoid flying LATAM in the future

### "service the absolute worst"
While the flight itself and the staff onboard was a pleasant experience, the after was not. LATAM lost my luggage without any knowledge of where it could be. For over 25 hours. I have not seen my family in Peru for well over 5 years, so now I must waste time to purchase clothing, sundries and medicine for myself and daughter because we were to be 250 miles away for vacation with all my family. Not only did they not know, they never offered a voucher, they single handedly ruined my family's time as well as cause misery and needless stress. When they finally found my luggage, it was way after we had already left for another destination, money wasted on new items and LATAM after numerous attempts for reimbursement, offers (after a week of contact) a 25 dollar voucher to be used towards a flight. Clothing in Peru is American pricing and that is the best LATAM could do? Because of them, I didn't have access to mine and my 5 year old daughters luggage for 3 more days, plus all the money and time spent on trying to reconcile this whole disaster that they more or less were trying to place blame of on us. Their customer service is the absolute worst. To make matters even worse, when we went to take a return flight, we were "chosen" for a random search because we complained, they took brand new unopened water bottles saying that American flights don't allow drinks purchased in airport and tossed them, wasting more money. If you ever have a problem with LATAM, you are completely out of luck trying to get matters rectified. Thank you for ruining my trip, for your lack of professional service and wasting all this precious time.

### "not responsible for delays"
Frankfurt to Sao Paulo. I lost my ground connection due to an operational issue. They acknowledge that was their fault that the plane was late and on top of that we had to wait for several other planes before takeoff. 2 hs delay that caused me to lose my ground transport and had to rebook it. I talked to LATAM customer service and they answered that they are not responsible for delays! To top it all, they have the same plane as 10 years back, oldest interiors I have seen lately. Basically a joke company. Avoid it if you can.

### "such a negative experience"
We could not take our flight between Sao Paulo and Madrid because our seats were already occupied (LATAM has overbooked). We had to wait 2 hours to be told that we would be transferred to the hotel and that Latam would contact us the next day to offer us new flights (our final destination being Paris). Without news of Latam, we decide to return to the Sao Paulo airport on our own (their voucher does not work with taxis). We learn there that they repositioned us on a flight 2 days later. They are told that it is not possible and that one needs to be in Paris the next day (February 28th). After 5 hours of negotiations, we finally managed to have a flight to Rome. Arriving in Rome we learn that Latam made a date error (March 28 instead of February 28) for our flight Rome Paris she booked with Air France. Apart from low cost, I have never had such a negative experience with a company. Especially since the vast majority of staff do not speak English. FR: Nous n'avons pas pu prendre notre vol entre Sao Paulo et Madrid car nos sièges étaient déjà occupés (la TAM a pratiqué le surbooking). Nous avons du attendre 2 heures pour que l'on nous explique que nous serions transférés à l'hôtel et que Latam nous contacterait le lendemain pour nous proposer de nouveaux vols (notre destination final étant Paris). Sans nouvelle de Latam, nous décidons de retourner à l'aéroport de Sao Paulo par nos propres moyens (leur voucher ne marchant pas avec les taxis). On apprend là bas qu'ils nous ont repositionner sur un vol 2 jours après. On leur explique que ce n'est pas possible et que l'on a besoin d'être à Paris le lendemain (28 février). Après 5 heures de négociations, on réussi enfin à avoir un vol en direction de Rome. Arrivée à Rome nous apprenons que Latam a fait une erreur de date (28 mars au lieu du 28 février) pour notre vol Rome Paris qu'elle a réservé auprès d'Air France. En dehors des low cost, je n'ai jamais eu une expérience aussi négative avec une compagnie. D'autant plus que la grande majorité du personnel ne parle pas anglais.

### "not the one I purchased"
Not Verified |  Buenos Aires to Miami. I purchased a ticket and a seat, after a couple of months I got an email with a itinerary change to one hour later. I accepted it. Now I am Checking in and I have a different seat, not the one I purchased. They say that I booked the seat in another flight and would only give me my money back and there is nothing they can do because my seat is already taken by someone else. I hate this airline. There is nobody to talk to, and no way to solve any problems what so ever.

### "I would recommend them"
Mexico to Santiago via Mendoza. The flight was very confortable and everything went well. The food and service was great and I was very happy with my flights with LATAM airways. I would recommend them.

### "fast short and smooth flight"
Rio de Janeiro to Sao Paulo. Positive: Fast check-in; clean aircraft; fast short and smooth flight; good cabin staff. Negative: They only served water - you had to ask to the cabin staff).

### "never experienced such treatment"
Lima to Los Angeles. I have a family of 6, 2 adults, 4 kids returning home on Latam from a holiday in Peru. We checked into our international flight as instructed 3 hours before the departure at the airport as we were unable to check in online before. As we were at the airport arriving from Cuzco the night before, the local agent said simply getting to the airport early and 3 hours before departure would ensure the ability to check in at the airport Kiosk. We had prepaid tickets and seat assignments. Upon check in at the airport in Lima early, 8:30 for our noon departure, we were told there were no seats for our 3 kids as the flight was oversold and my kids were bumped off the flight. They assured us that they would attempt to get volunteers off the flight to accommodate my kids. We spent 3 hours at the gate very stressed and upset. Luckily 2 seats became available. The flight began boarding and we were still waiting as they said the last seat for my son would become available. At this point the flight was boarded and they told us to board. 5 of us went through the gate onto the plane and then they stopped my son and said he had no seat. They closed the gate and left him there! He is 18 but regardless this was unbelievable! I have never heard of an airline breaking up a family and leaving a family member alone in a foreign country. I cried the whole way home. They promised my son $300, but he had to fight to get $200 for spending money. They got him a hotel room and he had to leave back to the US the next day. My travel agent and myself have tried to get through to the airlines about this situation, but they are indifferent and really don't care. Clearly this company is driven by greed and obviously resold our tickets to other passengers at a higher fee. We have traveled all over the world and have used airlines in all different countries but have never experienced such treatment in our lives. It is disgusting and I will never fly this airline again and would advise anyone considering flying Latam to consider any other option. We used them domestically as well and every flight was a disaster.

### "experience was quite bland"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Santiago de Chile. My experience with this airline and on this flight was quite bland. On a Qantas ticket, i waited 80mins in line to check in, as QF pax can not check in online and have to queue. They has 3 agents for bag drop ( which we couldn't use) and 2 for check-in. I have not waited that length of time since the early 90s. Completely poor thought process at YSSY. The agent alluded to it being due to Christmas; oddly enough it was the same flight and number of pax everyday. They hadn't added anymore seats or a bigger aircraft. It was a seat, some food and an uncomfortable chair. Service was efficient to the point that they did there job but there was no obvious pride in their role / job / service. Cabin crew were young, not particularly friendly and made pax feel as if they were truly on an airbus. Smiles were non existent somewhat millenial in their attitude. Meal service / selections were minimal and portions, just enough to hold you down. Normally for breakfast you get the option of a hot meal with a fruit salad and yoghurt; our option was fruit salad or yoghurt as an example of how frugal the airline was. I did not see cabin crew offer water in the cabin and needed to go to the galley to get a drink and when i asked for more than a cup, felt as though i had inconvenienced the cabin crew. The best thing about the flight was the aircraft; quiet, hydrated and comfortable. Not so the chair. Sadly with only Qantas providing competition, i would consider flying them again but would come on board more prepared with food and water.

### "ended up as a 25 hour flight"
London to Goiania via San Paulo. I purchased the flight as I was travelling with two young children and the 15 hours flight time was better than the other airlines. I never expected  that when you arrive in San Paulo you have to collect your luggage for the connecting flight (Also Latam) and go through immigration and customs before waiting in a massive queue to check into the domestic flight to Goiania, as you only have less that two hours to connect this is an impossible situation, and the check in staff admitted no one makes the published flight. So what was a 15 hour flight with connections ended up as a 25 hour flight. As far as I can see this breaks the advertising rules for one and is also a con by the airline to make it look good to the competition.

### "never fly with LATAM again"
Not Verified |  New York to Porto Alegre via Sao Paolo. I have no complaints for the service on the plane, but I will never fly with LATAM again. The customer service with the airline at the airport is horrible and you'll find yourself pulling teeth trying to figure out what exactly is going on. Everybody gives you a different answer for questions you have regarding your flights and it's extremely frustrating trying to deal with those who work for the airline (again, not as flight attendants but airport workers). On the way to Porto Alegre from JFK, I had a connecting flight in Sao Paolo. Since it was international to domestic, we had to pick up our bags and transfer them to the correct terminal. My sister checked her bag in and never saw it again since the woman working there sent it to a completely different city in Brazil. The entire time, my sister received no word on her bag and it wasn't until we got back to JFK in NY that we realized they found the bag in Sao Paolo (since it got sent back). This didn't matter though since when we got to JFK, 4 more bags were missing and we had no idea where they were. We were traveling with nine checked in bags and only received five when we got back to New York. Two of the bags missing were mine and I went home with absolutely no clothes, shoes, or gifts. After traveling 14 hours, this was rather frustrating and the response from LATAM employees at the airport was even more frustrating. They said how they didn't know how it happened and that sometimes security kept the bags extra to check them before sending them on the plane. I didn't think this made sense since five of the nine bags had been sent. They told us they'd "try their best" to find them and to keep our phones nearby just in case they found them on the next flight. It was just ridiculous that not one, but 5 bags had been lost during our experience with LATAM. Needless to say, this was the last time I would be flying with LATAM and I will makes sure to look into any other airline I use before flying with them.

### "They lost my checked baggage"
Buenos Aires to Chicago via Santiago. LATAM is the worst airline. Their customer service is worthless and they never help you with anything at all. They lost my checked baggage at Buenos Aires and United Airlines eventually found it but LATAM took forever to hand over my bag to United. They never care about your comfort and ease. They don't care about anything at all actually.

### "seating top notch"
We flew LATAM from Sydney to Santiago on a Qantas code share. From this experience LATAM is a dam fine airline. New aircraft, good cabin service, good sound inflight meals, good chilean wines, seating top notch and a very good IFE. There isn't much I can say negatively about this experience. Would recommend.

### "would never use LATAM again"
Not Verified |  Sao Paulo to Auckland via Santiago. I purchased a 3-leg ticket through eDreams. A few weeks later I was informed that LATAM had brought forward the 2nd leg by 35 mins. This created a layover between the 1st and 2nd legs of 70 mins. The minimun allowed is 75 mins. When this was brought to LATAM's attention the changed the 2nd flight to a later departing flight. A few weeks later this flight was cancelled. Back to the original problem! I phoned LATAM Help Center. The agent said that the minimum time between domestic and international flights at GRU was 60 mins - no problem. Great! But my Online Travel Agent said no. So I phoned LATAM again. This time an agent told me, at first 60 mins but then went away and came back and said 75 mins. He then told me to contact the airline supplying the 1st leg - Avianca - because they held the ticket. I asked if I could have a refund or change the date, no! I asked to speak to a supervisor, no. I asked him to write me an email, no. I would never use LATAM again.

### "no gluten free options"
Not Verified |  Guayaquil to Quito. I had to check in a piece of luggage and pay 20 bucks. And go to a self-service machine to print the bag tag and get my boarding pass. The flight had no gluten free options. (I am coeliac). If I had known that Avianca flew this route I would have taken that flight. My company's travel agent booked Latam, which I avoid whenever I can.

### "nothing to write home about"
Not Verified |  This airline is nothing to write home about. We had a connection flight from Sao Paulo to Rio and when the flight was delayed at Sao Paulo we missed our flight to Rio and LATAM made us stand at the airport for more than 3 hours. No one can speak English and when I got a hold of the Supervisor she stood with staff joking around laughing knowing that I was waiting for her. She was very unprofessional in her approach in how she dealt with everything, they then had to book us in to a hotel for the evening, and they booked a Hotel that was almost 2 hours away from the airport. The air hostesses were very unfriendly, when you asked them for something they give you this look of what now. We had a travel agent book this flight, will definitely advise them not to book this airline for future customers. Another thing, they only serve you dinner at 6.30 and then you don't see the airhostesses for the whole evening, only in the morning. If you do want water or a cold drink you must go to the back and ask them for it and then it is given to you with an attitude.

### "no information given at all"
Not Verified |  The flight was meant to be at 4.05pm, when we arrived at the gate it had changed to 17.45pm, with no information given at all. We were then waiting for almost 2 hours before the flight crew arrived and they allowed boarding to begin, we were then queued in a boarding corridor into the plane for the best part of 40 minutes. We arrived at Sao Paulo looking to get our connecting flight to Madrid as we both had work the day after. The flight was canceled and they sent us to a hotel overnight, gave us a voucher for a taxi, (which was of too low a value), so we had to go back and ask for another voucher. We were then denied the courtesy of an upgraded seat, I incurred further car parking charges at Heathrow for collecting my car a day late, lost a days work, my wife lost a days work., Surly and dismissive staff.

### "not be flying LATAM again"
Santiago de Chile to Sydney via Auckland. I have just come off a flight from Santiago de Chile to Auckland and have had the worst experience. My travel agent requested a vegan meal as am allergic to egg and fish. The meals I got had both egg and one had fish. Vegan meals are meant to have no animal products including egg, meat, fish and dairy. This has been the worst from any airline I have ever received. I certainly will not be flying LATAM in the future again.

### "wasted my time and money"
Montevideo to Sao Paulo via Rio de Janeiro. Thank you LATAM for ruining my Brazilian dream. I had 3 days in Brazil, Latam change my return flight for a way earlier flight and I accepted. That was fine because it was a direct flight. Then to go to Rio, the flight 2 hours delayed. I was really scared to miss my connection. When i arrived in Sao Paulo 40 min to run to the terminal 2 to catch my flight. Flight on the  screen is delayed 1h30 then 2 hours and then they changed gates, and after 2h30 i call the customer service, I want a refund or at least a part of the refund - the woman tell me we can change my return flight? I cannot change anymore my return flight because I have my obligation too, and she said that s the only thing she can offer and she cannot even do it right away. So I called for nothing. I will get nothing from them. They are by far the worst customer service I had in my life . I am not happy, I wasted my time and money.

### "we needed yellow fever jab"
Not Verified |  Our Santiago-Sao Paolo flight on LATAM Airlines on 7 April 2018 was delayed and we missed our connection to Johannesburg. We spent a total of 7 hours at GRU airport to sort things out and were stranded in GRU for 2 days. To make matters worse, we were denied boarding by LATAM on our rescheduled flight because we needed yellow fever jab for South Africa. Another 7 hours at GRU. Flights were full and we had no choice but to fly business on Emirates to Dubai to catch our connecting to Kuala Lumpur. There was no help from LATAM and at huge expense to us, besides the inconvenience, unnecessary hassle and loss of precious time. We submitted our claim  with complete documentation, for reimbursement of expenses incurred. LATAM offered to pay a miserable and ridiculous amount of USD370 each, which is only a fraction of LATAM economy airfare from SP to Johannesburg. It has been more than 7 months and LATAM refused to budge on their so-called “final offer”.

### "these guys try to fob you off"
Buenos Aires to Rio de Janeiro. Beware these guys try to fob you off on the phone. They promise quick return with no problem and get you to rate them 5 for helpfulness. I needed an urgent change on Monday for Wednesday. The agent promised figures with cost of change in a few minutes. Nothing. The agent the next day promised to be back in ten minutes. Nothing. It was now 5 o clock in the evening and I was due to fly next day. Prices well up. Rang again. They answered, I said I’d stay on until I got a figure. He came up with 1000 USD just to change. No uneven amounts. Clearly made up. I obviously lost a lot of money through their failure. The agent said his supervisor would ring me back. You guessed right. Never heard from him either. Their priority is to get you to give a high rating to their phone call and after that you’re on your own.

### "never fly with them again"
Sydney to Rio de Janeiro via Santiago. I've just purchased 13 tickets through the Black Friday sales, trying to organise this big group to go to Brazil next year for my wedding. I purchased 3 individual tickets separately (different itinerary), then 7 tickets at the same time and 3 people opted to do the transaction using their own credit cards. As soon as the purchase of the 7 tickets was confirmed, the price for the inbound flight went from A$686 to A$1140, although this was still Sunday, the 25th November, still within the Black Friday period promising the discounts. So we were forced to buy the 3 remainder tickets with the inbound flight on the next day (7 July). This morning I checked, and the flights on the 6 July were again down to A$686!!! I called and explained the situation but there is no way they could change the flights to the day before free of charge. I then tried again willing to pay the A$100 fee to get a refund (it was a 'plus' ticket and this is in the policy). It turns out the 'plus' doesn't apply because the outbound flight was a 'light' fare, in which case the whole trip becomes 'light' (so why are they allowed to sell it in the first place???). This Black Friday is the biggest scam I've ever seen because the increase the prices the day before and then apply the discount on the increase prices, so the discount is not the percentage promised anyway. The prices increase during the sales period. There was no understanding of the situation or consideration for a client who just bought 13 flights from them and I'll never fly with them again.

### "the system was not working"
Los Angeles to Santiago de Chile. I brought my ticket with miles through the frequent flyer program. I attempted to change the date for the outbound flight a week prior to the intended date. I called on 2 consecutive dates: Day 1, after being on the phone for over 1hour they couldn't help me because the system was not working. Day 2, after they were about to finalize my transaction and waiting 1hr 10min the call dropped. I waited for a call back for 40 min. Called back, after being on the phone for another 40min, they let me know that the price in miles is no longer the one arranged, and is now over 300,000 miles (5x the price arranged). I asked for a supervisor, he said they are not available. I asked how many were on staff, he said 2. This transaction was such a waste of my time and their time. They never attempted to call me back after the calls dropped, the price changed in a matter of minutes and they were not able to honor the offer. Supervisors are not available to speak with the costumer. This has to stop. I've flown with LAN before, the costumer service used to be comparable to market, but now as LATAM is horrible!

### "abandoned here in Cali"
Medellín to Bogota. I’ve been abandoned here in Cali. I have an important meeting in the morning. This is why I chose to fly and not take the bus. There is no communication. Also, the gate area had a scandalous movie on, the water isn’t drinkable from the faucet. Yet, we’ve not been given anything.

### "not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  I flew from Adelaide to Lima. On the way to Peru, I had no complaints regarding the company, they were fine. The day prior to leaving the country, I was in Cusco and checked into the flight (Lima to Santiago) and received a boarding pass with a specific seat number on this particular plane. I arrived at 10.30pm to check-in for my 2am flight in Lima the following morning only to be told that I no longer had a seat on the flight although I had a boarding pass with a seat number. I asked them how this was possible and they initially blamed my travel agent. When this was further questioned, the lady behind the desk then told me that there was a last minute change of plane and it is now smaller. I was extremely disappointed as this meant that O would miss 2 connecting flights and not be able to leave until 1pm the next day. The offered me a night in a hotel and transport, however, this doesn't change the fact that I was extremely inconvenienced. Due to this I would not recommend this airline and would do my best in the future to avoid travelling with them.

### "Terrible customer service"
New York to Santiago via Sao Paulo. Terrible customer service. They left our bags in Brazil and took 6 days to get them to Santiago. They wouldn’t allow us to make a claim for reimbursement until the bags had been lost for over 24 hours. On the way back, we bought a jar of honey inside the airport (post security) and they wouldn’t let us bring it in the plane claiming that the shop was not duty free and the airline would not allow for "liquids" of over x ounces from non-duty free shops. This was all post decided by the attendants that were checking hand luggage while boarding (at the gate). They said we could go back to the store and try to get our money back, but we could lose the flight if we weren’t back on time. The 4 hour flight from Brazil also had no working entertainment. We travel a lot, and this is the worst experience we’ve had so far with an airline.

### "Phoning this company a nightmare"
Not Verified | Auckland to Santiago. Phoning this company is a nightmare. Phoned 7+ times now, spent more than two hours to claim my miles I earned from previous flights. Prior that, I phoned (two months ago or so) to claim these same miles, I was told that they were 'getting transferred' that never happened. They never transfer your miles, this is not the first time, so if you flight with LATAM and expect to get miles, you have to be a dreamer or a big fighter with lots of patients cause you will have to phone, and fight with half this useless company.

### "service was okay"
Lima to Santiago de Chile. The flight was operated by a B787. As it was a morning flight, breakfast was served. Only one choice, an omelette, was available with tea or coffee. As it was a short 2 hour flight, I did not use the inflight entertainment system. Even for this short flight, a blanket and pillow were provided. Service was okay on this short sector.

### "impossible for me to get my boarding pass"
Somehow LATAM always manages to make the boarding process more stressful by doing as little as possible for the customer. This time, they made it impossible for me to get my boarding pass online and at the airport kiosk. At the counter, even though I fully and precisely informed the agent of my final destination, she did not book me all the way through and at the gate the LATAM agents kept us barricaded off till boarding time and allowed no time or opportunity to ask them questions. This also prevented me from checking in online or at a kiosk for the final leg of my journey leading to even more wasted time.

### "Had to bribe someone"
Lima to Guayaquil. Had to bribe someone for my paid airline seat! Arrived 3 hours early to my flight and they told me they gave my seat away and to come back tomorrow with no compensation. I informed them I have to catch a tour the same day. They told me to wait to see if anyone is willing to change their flight. I waited 2 hours at the counter with no luck. I then held up cash and yelled to anyone in line heading to Guayaquil I am willing to pay for their seat. I thankfully had a taker. I can’t believe I had to bribe someone for a flight I paid for, checked in online and had a seat reserved! Apparently Latam doesn’t guarantee anything until you are physically in the airplane.

### "no reason to travel with LATAM"
Sao Paulo to Paris. I decided to give LATAM a second chance after a bad experience between Sao Paulo and Frankfurt two years ago. After all, they have new A350s to Paris, with their "new" Premium Business cabin and service. Check-in at the GRU was fast and efficient, but the Business class boarding pass was a piece of paper similar to a fast-food ticket. I was directed to a beautiful but crowded lounge with good little bites and drinks options. This time, getting on board was on time, and I found the wide cabin looking nice in the mood lighting and properly cleaned. A undrinkable "welcome" Chilean sparkling was served and the crew distributed menus and small amenity kit. Unfortunately, double seats (2-2-2 configuration) are not private at all and I had a very annoying passenger sitting next to me and complaining loudly about the poor food and service throughout the dinner time. I cannot blame him as the food was of very bad quality as well as the wines, certainly not suitable for a Premium Business class or even an international economy class. With everything in a little tray, which was dirty and well used with lots of cracks and tears, they served a choice between a simple salad or small soup, a hard loaf from the basket, the main course of braised beef with vegetables and a slice of canned pineapple. From the wine list of 3 red wines, 1 Argentinian and 2 Chilean, only one of the Chileans was available, a cheap and inedible, acid one. The two flight attendants were polite but unable to attend the full cabin of 30 passengers in a timely manner, and while they were trying to hurry, they often forgot items such as drinks, water, bread or jumping a few seats which left some passengers really upset. It was impossible to get a second round of water, (hard) bread or drinks, but for the low quality wine, I did not complain. After dinner, toilets were already so dirty with water on the floor and other debris, very disgusting, but deteriorated even more during the flight. For entertainment, no wifi, and the system loaded with some movies and music had to be restarted 3 or 4 times due to a malfunction. At least the seat was flat and the A350 is a wide aircraft with large windows and high ceiling and I was able to sleep for a few hours. In the morning, a terrible breakfast was served with a dry and tasteless omelette, a hard bread but okay small slices of fruit and coffee. Although it is a flight of almost 12 hours, no snacks were available or any kind of service provided during mid flight. Fortunately, the flight arrived on time and I was able to quickly connect with Aeroflot for a shorter flight but for a much better experience. I travel twice a year between Sao Paulo and Europe and use different airlines. There is no reason to travel with LATAM if you can choose Air France, Iberia, Lufthansa, Tap or Swiss for the same fare.

### "never fly this airline again"
Pereira to San Andres Island via Bogota / Cartagena. Terrible airline. Even though I showed the ticket agents both leaving and returning their baggage policy website from a link in my electronic ticket which stated I was allowed one free carryon and one checked bag their charged me twice for my checked bag and forced me to give up my carryon bag which was within the allowable limits when I boarded their planes. My checked bag was also damaged beyond repair on the return trip and severs articles were stolen enroute. I will never fly this airline again, that is certain!

### "Dirty, ancient aircraft"
Lima to Cusco. Awful ground service. Dirty, ancient aircraft. Cramped seats. No control over hand luggage. Flight attendant's English is incomprehensible and non-existent. Check in process was a joke, and not a good one. After checking in in the kiosk, we still had to stand in another line to drop the bags off, online check in isn't available, though advertised. Boarding is a mess, an zones aren't followed.

### "I am beyond unsatisfied"
Worst airline experience ever. I had 6 flights total, and only the very last flight was supposed to be with another airline. First my first flight to my destination was delayed an hour, which would have caused me to miss my connecting flight. I did luckily at that point have a super lady assist with fixing that. Then I find out on my trip that my two return flights with them were changed and literally all over the place. My first flight was now taking off when my last flight was supposed to and my middle flight was going in the opposite direction. I had to have my father call on my behalf, who was on the phone with them for roughly 3 hours trying to fix this and get me on the appropriate flights, which apparently would have cost over $2000 CAD, even though online told a much different story, but it doesn’t seem like they were willing to fix their mistakes. So I had to accept the only free flight change they were willing to offer me, which really wasn’t free since I needed an extra night at the hotel, and one layover went from 2 hours to 7 hours. This also required me cancelling an appointment that was made two months prior and now rescheduled in another month and a half. I am beyond unsatisfied and will not be using LATAM Airlines again.

### "Worst customer service"
Quito to Ceunca. Worst customer service I have ever experienced! Had to spend 13 hours in the airport since they wouldn’t accommodate me with a delay from a prior flight from Miami which caused me to miss my flight. Had to buy an additional ticket to a Cuenca and also one for the returning flight to Quito since they cancelled my entire ticket due to me missing my first flight. Then they charged me $50 more for a bag that was supposed to be included in the price of the ticket. Will never fly with this airline again.

### "Cannot say anything negative"
Despite the utterly chaotic and delayed boarding once we were on the aircraft everyone settled in quietly. Seat comfort acceptable, good recline, pillow, blanket and headsets on the seat. Soon after take off menus were handed out and then dinner and drinks were served. Food, dinner and breakfast, good although portions on the small side. Very smooth flight, good IFE, pleasant cabin crew. Cannot say anything negative about the entire flight.

### "by far the worst airline"
Calama to Buenos Aires via Santiago. I would strongly recommend that you never use this airline. We are seasoned travelers and fly a lot with many different airlines but LATAM are by far the worst airline I have ever had the misfortune to deal with. They are incompetent liars and when things go wrong their customer service is abysmal. I don’t know if they are purposely being completely ineffective hoping that I will give up or if they just don’t have the training and skills to deal with customers. I am surprised that they are allowed to be part of the one world alliance as they tarnish the brand. Every flight we have ever taken with them has been delayed and the check in process is chaos regardless of the airport, with long queues. On the 5th Sep we flew from Calama to Buenos Aires via Santiago. The time for boarding came and went without any announcement so we went to see what was happening. The ground staff were running around telling everyone that the flight was overbooked and couldn’t leave until they removed some bags and passengers. They were asking for passengers to volunteer not to take the flight so that it could depart. They were physically collecting people’s boarding passes from them. Initially they said they needed 20 passengers to volunteer in order for the flight to leave and then they said they needed an additional 12. We eventually left without a single seat spare. Then when we reached Santiago, my husband and I ran to the gate for our connection and reached there 1 hour before departure, as boarding was commencing but the LATAM staff refused us access to our flight, even though we had boarding passes. They said we were not allowed to fly on a plane without our bags and that they were unable to get our bags onto that flight due to the delay to our previous flight. We were told no later flights were available to the airport we had booked but that we would be booked onto a flight 2 hours later to a different Buenos Aires airport. This was so that we could supposedly fly with our bags, as per their policy. We were given new boarding cards, with seats in the 6th row and asked to wait. When we went to board the later plane we realised it was a much smaller and older plane than the one we had booked. It had no entertainment and was dirty. Then the icing on the cake was when we went to board they told us we couldn’t sit in our assigned seats and had been moved to the back of the plane because our seats had been given to someone else. When we eventually landed, you can imagine how horrified we were that after the sequence of LATAM failures that we had already endured, our bags did not arrive. We had been lied to about why we couldn’t board our original connection and why we had to fly to another airport and endure further delays. We queued at the baggage counter for a further hour trying to report our missing bags. We were told that the bags were still in Santiago but that there was no way of knowing when they would arrive in Buenos Aires. We were instructed to wait in our apartment at all times in case our bags arrived as no time or day could be given. We waited 3 days (it was a 4 night break to BA) before our bags arrived and our entire trip was wasted. More than one month later we have no resolution from LATAM. They now say that our issue was caused by “weather conditions” they don’t answer any of our questions when we write to them and they take 15-20 days each time they need to reply to a message. It is appalling.

### "food plan is mean on quantities"
Boarding organised by groups. Premium, row numbers, etc. However, we all ended up bussed to the aircraft so a free for all at the stairs to climb up to the plane. Very comfortable seats, good IFE. Meals acceptable although the LATAM food plan is mean on quantities, no starter, no bread and small packaged sweet. Getting a drinks refill takes patience and repeated requests. Cabin announcements in portuguese and unintelligible english. Only four of six toilets working making for some rather long queues. Before landing cabin crew did not walk through the cabin checking seat belts, upright seatbacks, etc. Very strange. Otherwise, this daytime flight very acceptable.

### "Worst experience ever"
Sao Paulo to Santiago de Chile. LATAM delayed 5hours my flight. Call center with arrogant people they are obliged by Brazilian law to change the flight and somehow they dont comply with the law until you mention that you do know your rights. They are trained to lie to you, even though there are seats available in the website they told me all flight were fully booked and they could not book me in the next day, just 3 days form the original delayed flight. Worst experience ever. Dirty duvet and pillow. Arrogant FA. Avoid!

### "keeps getting worse and worse"
Cancun to Lima. This airline keeps getting worse and worse. From a terrible frequent flyer program which used to be good to simply terribly old planes, terrible entertainment options and low cost options at premium prices.

### "every flight has been delayed"
Mendoza to Buenos Aires. 4 hour delay- every flight we have taken with LATAM has been delayed by at least two hours, it really defeats the purpose of flying. If you are flying with LATAM, make sure you have nothing to do that day.

### "Onboard experience a mixed bag"
Santiago de Chile to Sao Paulo. Latam lounge in Santiago nice, with lots of space and some privacy as well, food surprisingly good (some high quality chirashi, for example), with a wide selection of wines and drinks. Onboard experience with Latam today is a mixed bag, it used to be a premium airline let's say 10 years ago but doesn't feel it any longer. This time our B777-300 was an old, really old TAM aircraft, interior had seen much better days and seats were worn out (on the brink of breaking down in some places, with some tape here and there). Seats were in a 2-2-2 configuration without direct aisle access for most passengers, therefore (unless you were in the central pair of seats) either you climb on your neighbour or you get climbed upon to gain aisle access; all in all narrow seat, not very comfortable. I read Latam will retrofit all long haul aircraft to a new business class cabin, I really hope this happens soon as today the feeling is all but premium. Boarding was sort of an "all-in" experience since, although priority was enforced, we had to wait some 20 minutes to actually get on the plane (everybody from one door), therefore once we boarded there was a general mess that prevented FAs to be somehow useful to premium passengers. Once in flight, service was just OK (crew not that much interested in providing anything more than what was needed), food bland and amenities almost non existent even in a 4 hours flight. Left on time - arrived on time. One big plus with Latam is the bedding, with large fluffy pillow and a soft white duvet; nice but not enough to save this flight from an average overall feeling.

### "never book with them again"
Campo Grande to Fortaleza. I spent 1.5 hours trying to buy luggage for my flight with no help from customer service. I don't understand why its impossible to just buy something simple like luggage. They cant take my credit card over the phone and then say I can do it online but when I go online it says call customer service. I will never book with them again.

### "my luggage did not arrive with me"
When I arrived to London, my luggage did not arrive with me. Even though it was priority luggage (since I was flying business class and I am an emerald frequent flyer on one world and a premium black on latam). After 14 days Latam did not find the luggage and they have not given me any kind of compensation for the delay/loss. This on top of the fact that the airplanes are old, food is not good and entertainment system is updated.

### "I wouldn't fly LATAM again"
Melbourne to Santiago. I wouldn't fly with LATAM again. This is a long flight and though the Boeing 787 is a nice quiet aircraft the squashed 3-3-3 seat configuration and short distance between seats makes it a bit like a domestic flight. We found the cabin staff to be uninterested - except in an older couple in the row in front of us whom various staff spent the first couple of hours chatting to - leaning on others seats and blocking the aisles. When it came to meal times, this couple were given first choice of meals - then after normal meal service had finished were given another meal - different to what was available to the rest of the economy cabin. The food was bland and small servings. There didn't appear to be any of the usual between meals snack available on other airlines. We were an hour late leaving Melbourne and still an hour late arriving, that gave us 10 min to make our connection. Staff were unhelpful in providing advice on what we should, so we just packed all our stuff up before landing and as soon as the seatbelt signs went off we ran to the front of the plane. As it turns out it only took 5 minutes to get to the next gate - where we discovered that the connecting flight was also delayed. We waited 45 minutes without explanation. When we did board we were seated about the cargo loading doors and noticed our bags being loaded - an hour after we had landed.

### "I was extremely impressed"
Recently flew LATAM for the first time from Sydney to Auckland. I was extremely impressed. The service across the board was excellent. Check in was fast and painless. LATAM uses the Qantas Business Lounge at Sydney Airport which is always nice. The aircraft was a relatively new Boeing 787-8. Service from the crew onboard was top notch they were friendly and efficient and really looked after the passengers well. LATAM have a really nice Business Class seat on their 787's. The seat is extremely comfortable with many different options and choices for reclining. In the flat bed position the seat is also very comfortable. The food onboard was fresh and tasty. LATAM have a extensive range of non alcoholic and alcoholic beverage choices so you never run out of options. The inflight entertainment was superb with a huge variety of TV Shows, movies, games and music. The inflight entertainment is also very easy to use. I was also very impressed to see LATAM give out an amenity kit on a 3 hour flight. Overall I was extremely impressed and would not hesitate to fly LATAM again.

### "I would never recommend it"
Flight from Santiago to Frankfurt with connection in Sao Paulo. Airplane arrived to Santiago with 1 hour delay, once boarded aircraft maintenance was required which delayed the flight an additional hour. During the flight the attendants made no mention about passengers who would loose their connections (30-40 people). The aircraft was old the tvs would not work and the meal was bland and untastefull (sandwich with margarine and cheese). Once landed in Sao Paulo two incredibly ignorant, arrogant and unhelpfull staff began trying to explain and solve the connection problems, using their cellphones to contact their superiors. Even though they had knowledge from 6 hours ago that the flight was delayed they hadn't prepared any solution for any passenger, trying to resolve our connection issues when he had just landed. We ended up loosing the flight to Frankfurt and they informed us we would have to wait for the next flight which was in 24 hours, upon pressing and complaining more they gave us tickets for a flight to Barcelona and then to Berlin which would save us around 7 hours. They gave us vouchers for transportation and a hotel that was 40 kms away from the airport. The hotel was mediocre and in an industrial neighborhood. In short we have lost 24 hours due to LATAM'S innoperance. Their staff is incredibly ignorant and disrespectfull and it is clear that this is the way this company operates. Last time we are ever flying with LATAM and I would never recommend it to anyone.

### "unhelpful and substandard airline"
Sao Paulo to Frankfurt. A terribly disorganized, unhelpful and substandard airline from start to finish. I experienced many issues with this airline, some of which are below. Old and tired looking aircraft on both legs. On return journey our flight was changed last minute while awaiting boarding due to a technical fault that resulted in a missed connection and delay of over five hours. No information was provided at all either en route or upon landing for connecting passengers. Finally spoke to an incredibly rude representative at the LATAM desk in Hall C (Frankfurt airport) who informed us that we were re-booked onto two flights to reach our destination (Dublin) despite there being availability on a direct flight later that evening with BA/Aer Lingus operated. We were told LATAM doesn't have an agreement with these airlines and LATAM refused to transfer us to that available flight. We were then given an 8€ voucher for meals and refreshments - when we spoke to the manager she said this was the maximum refreshments voucher value they would provide. A coffee and piece of cake in Starbucks cost about basically much...Eventually arrived back in Dublin via Frankfurt and Amsterdam 5hr 15mins later than intended which very much affected our previously arranged plans. Other LATAM highlights include small, bland meals, no spirits (vodka, gin etc) available, impolite and/or uninformed staff and a total lack of empathy or help even when their airline is completely in the wrong. Will never fly with LATAM again (either internationally or domestically - GOL Aer Linheas were far superior) and would strongly urge other regular flyers to avoid this airline at all costs.

### "could not accept me for travel"
I recently had the misfortune of travelling on LATAM from South Africa to Brazil, a route I fly often but my first time on LATAM. I have five specific complaints, number 5 is the best! 1) My bag did not make the connection from CPT to GRU in JNB. I waited more than 4 days for the bag to be delivered after it was actually left at GRU airport after it arrived in GRU after the next flight I was on with no action by the airline. There was no immediate compensation or assistance, told to mail their call center and I will receive USD 25 in my bank account within 2 weeks? Not sure how that helps. 2) Food portions on board, strange hot meal only concept with no bread, salad, desert etc. 11 hour flight and everybody hungry. Breakfast a single slice of bread and a yogurt on a long haul flight? Cost cutting mixed with a consultant that never spoke to customers managing catering? 3) Crew and Call Center staff do not speak English, I can understand if there is only basic English but no English is a concern in a safety situation. 4) Delay on the return flight of 2.5 hours, delays happen which is fine but it is obvious that the JNB route is treated as a route that is left for a last resort maintenance aircraft, checking flight radar the flight was delayed on all days I could check. 5) My biggest issue! On my return trip I would miss my connection in JNB to CPT due to the delay, no issue as I would be rebooked on the next flight, my original connection was on Comair, I was then moved to SAA. When I asked for my boarding pass for my connecting flight I was told I would receive it in JNB. On arrival in JNB SAA said I had no booking at the check in counter, I was referred to ticketing. At ticketing I was told that LATAM had used my JNB-CPT coupon for the GRU-JNB segment and they could not accept me for travel. I was referred to the LATAM office managed by Menzies. Menzies informed me that they could not help and that I must wait for LATAM staff to complete the departure of the outbound flight, needless to say 6 hours later I was in CPT! LATAM would you care to respond to me on my experience as your twitter customer line and your office in South Africa is not interested in doing so. Please tell me why I should choose your service again on a route I fly 6 times a year?

### "I had a bad trip"
Santiago to Melbourne. First of all, once we boarded and were seated the captain said that due to inconvenience with the aircraft we would have to wait for 30 minutes, this meant that everyone should get off the plane. That 30 min delay turned out in a 6 hour delay. Once in the plane they gave us a menu so as to choose the food we wanted to eat, but as if they were joking us, they later said that they did not have that food because they confused when loading it in the aircraft. After the 14 hour flight to Melbourne and arriving almost at midnight, I received my baggage broken. Customer service people at Melbourne airport were super kind. However, when going to the place where they told me my luggage was going to be replaced, the guy at the shop told me they no longer worked for LATAM because of the amount of broken baggage. I had a bad trip, but I am really disappointed with the workers at LATAM, they are uninformed and treat its clients in a disrespectful manner.

### "Worst economy class seat"
Santiago to Sao Paulo. Could not check in on line because of a lack of the web site system. Call center arrogant lady, it is useless asking to speak to another attendant because they cut the call out. B777 aircraft very old and with torn seats. IFE broken. Boarding chaotic since the signs for rows/seats and priority boarding are small and only in Spanish. Food unedible. Worst economy class seat I have experienced. High density rows 3-4-3 in economy. Staff rude and arrogant!

### "flight was cancelled"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Santiago via Lima. The flight from Sydney to Chile was fantastic but the flight from Lima to Santiago Chile was a disgrace. Our flight was cancelled but we were not told and the flight we took was very late and we were not given business seats which we paid for. The worst experience was trying to obtain proper compensation which was not adequate and the many emails and phone calls to Latam to obtain payment.

### "canceled at the check in"
Frankfurt to Sao Paulo. Our flight for the entire family was canceled at the check in, as supposedly overbooked, a catastrophe for us. As compensation we were offered 2400 €. Eight months later, despite repeated pledges, the money has still not been transferred, and now it's what happened to all of Brazil's passengers, namely, that this company is simply cheating. DE: Unser Flug für die gesamte Familie wurde am Check in storniert , da angeblich überbucht, für uns eine Katastrophe. Als Entschädigung wurden uns 2400 € angeboten. Acht Monate später wurde das Geld trotz mehrfacher Zusagen immer noch nicht überwiesen und jetzt ist genau das passiert, was uns die ganzen brasilianischen Fluggäste vorher gesagt haben: nämlich dass diese Gesellschaft schlicht und einfach betrügt.

### "problem after problem"
La Paz to Santiago. We flew as a family for a holiday in Peru. The few short flights we had with LATAM were riddled with problem after problem. We missed our first day of our trip, because LATAM sold our prepaid tickets, so we had to wait 6 hours at the airport, to get another flight. We were unable to check in 48 hrs prior, as there was no wifi. On another flight, our bags were lost for 2 days. They had inflexible seating arrangements, resulting in splitting our small group up. We will never travel with LATAM again and highly recommend using alternate airlines.

### "Flight attendants efficient"
Superb afternoon/evening flight from Easter Island to Santiago, Chile. Flight on schedule. Boarding by stairs after walking across from apron from the terminal building. Pillow, blanket and headset at every seat which also had footrest. A limited in-flight entertainment program available on the screens on the back of every seat. Available in English and Spanish. Flight attendants efficient, amiable and attentive and fluently bilingual. Choice of 3 meals - chicken, salmon and vegetarian sandwiches. Complimentary beverages including Chilean wines and beers. Adequate leg space at seat; lavatories were clean; announcements were audible. A well-executed operation.

### "Two luggages were lost"
Asuncion to New York via Sao Paulo. Worst customer service ever. Two luggages were lost. The airline never called us to update the status. Upon calling several times just to find out he company had no idea of the location of the lugagges. They offered to pay 25 USS/day. Had to go back to the airport to pick the money. Never use this airline.

### "Never use this airline"
I needed to check in an extra bag for my LATAM flights within Peru. The website made it clear that the cost was double if paid for at the airport - however there was no provision to add an extra bag in advance online (as with every other airline) not even when online check in opened. By then I was in Peru and, not being a Spanish speaker, asked my concierge to phone LATAM to purchase additional baggage. After a call lasting an hour they processed my credit card and then said a mistake had been made and they had charged US$161 instead of 161 Peruvian Soles. At this point the call was cut off. The concierge called back and was told the mistake had been reversed and then charged me the correct fee of US$50. In fact the erroneous charge had not been reversed. I have made numerous phone calls, filled in the correct forms and made 2 written complaints through the website. This has generated 4 different case numbers but no substantive reply let alone a refund. Further phone calls say the cases are closed. My travel agent has also tried through their agents here and in Peru but have had no response. 4 months have passed. LATAMs policy seems to be to profit from their mistakes by ignoring their customers and agents. Never use this airline.

### "avoid this company"
New York to Lima. Maybe the worst customer service that I have ever encountered. Their policies are so unhelpful it is maddening. I was trying to add additional flights to my itinerary. They refused to let me spend more money. Honestly avoid this company at all costs.

### "We got left behind"
Cuzco to Puerto Maldonado. We got left behind while at the gate because the had sold more tickets than they can seat. Our tickets were purchased and were waiting to go inside when they said they couldn’t allow more passengers. After complaint for a long time we gave up and opted for some sort of compensation and for our flight to be for the next day and the day of return to be posted for another extra day since we were only staying for two days. So they agreed to give us tickets for July 25 and our return on the 27 so we could stay 2 days to visit. When we went to check in on the 25 for our flight we wanted to make sure our return date was on the 27 and they had told us that it was the next day. We were annoyed and extremely mad because they had previously confirmed that our return date was the 27 not the 26. Again after arguing back and fourth they finally said they had our seats confirmed for the 27 but who knows if they’re lying once again to get us to just leave and someone else deal with us. We have a family member that works in puerto claiming they were lying that they couldn’t get us our tickets. According to her, on the system they had open seats on a flight but they wouldn’t give it to us. We had to ask for our money back since this was getting absurd. They finally gave us what we had asked for.

### "going down every year"
Not Verified |  This airline which used to be one of Brazil's best, is just going down every year. Now they're charging baggage and seats, in a claim that is a service. The borading service is also paid and in a 3 hour flight, if you don't pay, you only get water. On menu there are some terrible sandwiches, dry, for 30 reais (12 dolars). The seats are small and the tickets are not cheap. The worst part is that LATAM doesn't even is a low cost airline. Well, at least not in the ticket price, because on its service...

### "overbook all flights"
Flew Concepción to Santiago. Please try another airline, LATAM now overbook all flights leaving you on ground as they want. Service sucks, no problem solving, less space for your legs on board, pay for any food or beverage, pay for your baggage, a low cost airline using the great corporate image of LAN Chile. The fusion with TAM as LATAM has been a serious issue, not for business, for all of us.

### "zero customer service"
Flew New York JFK to Mendoza via Santiago with LATAM. Very expensive airline with zero customer service. Never book this airline through a travel agent of any kind. I paid over $4,000 for a ticket to Santiago 6 months in advance and when I tried to add a flight to Mendoza less than 1 week later, LATAM told me that I can’t do that until 2 days before the flight because I booked through Expedia. I was perfectly willing to pay a change penalty. They still wouldn’t allow me to add a flight! I have never encountered this problem with any other airline.

### "one of the worst airline"
Sao Paulo to London. This airline is going from a good one to one of the worst airlines you can fly between South America and Europe. Website is always showing some errors, online check-in does not work, Airport check in is OK, VIP Lounge is right now the best product they can offer boarding is chaotic with no Priority respect, plane is OK need some update. Cabin crew is friendly but should get some English lessons since they couldn't help a Britain Customer in any way - IFE broken, service is below you get on any European airline. If have not figure out if LATAM has destroyed the good reputation LAN had in the past after their merger with TAM, or as many Brazilian believe the Chilean Management have not idea about customer satisfaction.

### "looked like it was poorly maintained"
On June 7th, 2018 I called the LATAM Customer service about my baggage allowance for a flight to Bucaramanga, Colombia. I was told by the LATAM customer service representative that I was allowed 2 bags under 23kg, I mentioned that I was playing a Golf Tournament in Bucaramanga and I was going to take a luggage bag under 23kg and a golf bag under 23kg, the LATAM Customer representative confirmed that it was allowed. So, I got a huge surprise at Check-In in Miami when I was forced to pay $100 for the Golf Bag for being a sporting equipment bag, this is ridiculous since that it is not the case on other airlines and I bought the Airline Ticket under False Pretense! On my return flight from Bucaramanga, I got a bigger surprise, when I was charged a higher fee this time, $119.27. Why? This is wrong, that I bought an Airline Ticket under false pretenses! Also, the food service was awful, the plane was dirty and it looked like it was poorly maintained. My seat on the return flight was loose, seat 13L. The only provide entertainment via an application and the seats have no charge connections for the IPAD or Phone!

### "never fly with Latam again"
My family (wife and two-year-old daughter) and I flew from Sao Paulo, Brazil to Los Angeles, California in May. The flights themselves were fine, but when we arrived in LA we found that all our luggage was lost. Annoying, but relatively common. One of the items Latam lost was our carseat which was needed for us to drive home. Latam's response "there's nothing we can do. Giving out loaner car seats in this situation is common practice at every other major airline. Latam's "solution" was for me to drive around LA at 10pm to find an open store and purchase a new carseat (not sure what would've happened if my wife was traveling alone with our daughter?). All this added 4 hours to our travel time getting us home very late and with a very tired two-year-old. We were told by everyone we at Latam LAX that we would be reimbursed by Latam for the purchase price of the carseat we were forced to buy AND we would get all our property back. We received our luggage 4 days later, but no carseat (wrapped up with the carseat was a small, antique, wooden stool a family member gave our daughter which can not be replaced). We contacted Latam and they said it can't be found and that the case was closed because we were already reimbursed for the purchase price of the carseat we were forced to buy (the price of the carseat we lost was MUCH higher than the one we bought in a panic). We have still not been reimbursed for our lost property and are just repeatedly being told they can't do anything. Every step of this process has been horrible. From the staff at LAX to the call center staff to the email exchanges. Everyone has treated us like it is our fault they lost our property. I have repeatedly been told by the call center staff there is no supervisor or manager on duty (a blatant lie, there's no such thing as a call center with no supervisors). This has been a horrible (and expensive) experience. I will never fly with Latam again and suggest nobody does! If companies are judged by how they act when things do not go well, then Latam is the worst company I've ever dealt with.

### "the airline did not fix the problem"
We travelled LATAM Airlines from JFK to Lima in June of this year. On our way to Lima already chairs in business class did not work correctly but we decided not to complain since things can happen. Well, on our way back from Lima to JFK after boarding a plane we were told that our two seats in business class were broken. We can assume that for more than a week the same chairs were broken and the airline did not fix the problem. Plains are ancient. In economy class, you cannot even move the armrest. You see the lack of maintenance.

### "Latam does not deliver on time"
We live in Pucallpa, Peru. The last 5 interactions with Latam Airlines have all been disappointing. They let me sit in the airplane on the tarmac for 1.5 hours, then had us return to wait in the terminal for another 2 hours. Then they cancelled the flight. I believe they knew the whole time there was a technical problem with the plane the whole time, but waited until we could not have rescheduled to one of the other 4 flights that left that night. I saw them pull the luggage loading ramp up to the plane to take the luggage off the plane 2 hours before they cancelled the flight. They then rescheduled for the next morning. As a result, I did not meet my friend in Lima who flew out the next morning - the main purpose for my flight. Lots of people then missed their connecting flight to the United States. A nightmare for the traveler and for us who are supporting their trip. Our visitor's flight from Lima to Pucallpa was cancelled due to "fog". They did not take off from Lima for another 3 hours. Today I went to pickup another group flying Latam. This flight came to Pucallpa, but did not land because of "fog", then flew back to Lima. What a waste of time It seems like they are flying VFR (Visual Flight Regulations). They probably will not come now until the regularly scheduled evening flight - another 12 hours. How can they not know the weather conditions? How can they fly a commercial plane that cannot land in what I would call "mild" fog? As a side note, the arrival monitor said that the flight had landed. It is a problem living in a culture where it is so easy to lie. Yesterday, another visitor who purchased her ticket with Latam 3+ months ago, checked in with Latam 3 hours before the flight and was told it was overbooked and would have to wait 12 hours before the next flight. Ridiculous ! We had her buy a ticket on Peruvian and come much sooner. Latam now has a policy for different fares for different amount of luggage. In the process of booking my flight, it seemed like they were extracting fees for what is normal on other airlines here in Peru. They said my carry-on was too large and charged me $25 dollars. My carry on is a regulation size and I have never had a problem with the other airlines in Peru carrying it on for the past 6 years. The bottom line: Visitors come for 6 or 7 days, and are wasting up to 2 days of their trip because Latam does not deliver their flights on time. I would choose Peruvian Airlines, Star Peru, or LC Peru. Note: Watch LC Peru's luggage limits if you are coming from the USA with 2 bags (LC flys smaller airplanes). Hope this is helpful.

### "got a good deal price wise"
Traveled from São Paulo to Johannesburg. Disorganized boarding, late almost two hours, three gate changes. Old plane. SAA overtook us by 2 hours. Food is bad. To organize special meals - in hope you get a better meal - you have to call them. Good luck with that when in Brazil: long wait. Otherwise, call another country for better service. I’ve called Germany and it worked just fine. Website is also full of 404 errors. Enthusiastic cabin crew, maybe to try to compensate the airline shortcomings? Oh, one cabin crew member didn’t speak English. She had to ask for help. Fair thing to say: I got a good deal price wise.

### "price has risen more than 100%"
Los Angeles to Lima. My wife and I are planning a trip to Peru and were purchasing tickets as usual through Cathay Pacific website from Hong Kong to Lima (Peru) with transit in LA. As there was no option to book business class tickets for LA to Lima part of the trip in the end we have purchased only Hong Kong to LA through Cathay Pacific and decided to use the LATAM website to purchase business class tickets for LA to Lima on the same day. Everything was great until the payment part on LATAM website. Once we have entered the Visa CC details and clicked on pay now we have instantly received message that payment is rejected and to try making the payment again with provided link. As we were surprised with the message we have tried to make payment using MasterCard which in the end was also rejected by the website (ticketing office). At this pint we were scared about what has happened and decided to contact LATAM customer service directly. The CS officer picked up the call relatively fast and we have given him the reservation code to which he mentioned that the reservation is visible in the system but that their website sometimes rejects payments for no apparent reason. After waiting awhile for him to check with his manager he has offered to put us through to phone payment option where we again imputed our credit card details to be put on hold for another 5-10 minutes. The CS officer got back to us saying that unfortunately they are not able to accept payment over the phone at this time and in case we would like to keep the reservation we would need to go to ONE WORLD partner ticketing office in Hong Kong and make payment by presenting reservation code in matter of several days. As everything was done on Saturday I drove for 2 hours to HK airport and Cathay Pacific (one world partner) ticketing office to make the payment. At the counter I was told that CP is not able to accept payments for any other OneWorld partner ticket reservations. At this moment we called LATAM Customer Service again and they have said they are sorry for giving us wrong information but if we try again through their website the payment would now be accepted. I have gone online to try purchasing the tickets again while on the phone with CS but the price has risen more than 100% at the time. As we had reservation pending for payment in worth of cca US$7500 they didn't want to offer us the same price but told us that we have to pay US$16000 as the price displayed on their website at present. After complaining to CS over the phone they have said that they are not able to help us with problem anymore and if we want to complain we can do so online. So not only we lost the acceptable price for Business Class tickets, money for 2 hours worth of international calls but we were also scared as our connecting flights might not match. At this moment we had to contact Cathay Pacific to help us purchase connecting flight economy class by cancelling HK-LA tickets and reissuing HK-Lima tickets. It was the worst CS handling of a problem caused by either really lousy website or poor security center team for their payments as payment went through 3d authentication. Now we have a long flight with really busy schedule in Peru with no chance of relaxing on the airplane ahead of us.

### "their app didn't update"
Florianopolis to Rio de Janiero via Sao Paulo. This was my third and fourth flight with Latam in Brazil, I was late for my first flight to Sao Paulo, because their app didn't update the time change of the flight, to be fair they did send me an email, a couple of weeks before, I missed the flight but they changed the flight with no charge, which was really good customer service because the fault was with both of us. Both planes look old inside, also both times the headphone ports did not work. On my flight there was an option for wifi connectivity I downloaded the app but it didn't work.

### "inside the plane looks dated"
Iguazu Falls to Florianoplois via Sao Paulo. At the airport, the staff were lovely but their check-in machine did not work, it's better to line up. The first flight was lackluster, the plane from the outside looks sharp but inside the plane looks dated, on both flights the headphone ports did not work, so no in-flight entertainment. LATAM Airlines was the most expensive airline in Brazil for the flights I wanted and there was no food, they did hand out water, it wouldn't be so bad if their competitors did the same. On the second flight, we got on the bus (everything was smooth) but the bus stopped next to a TAM airplane which caused a little confusion. Again no headphone port working. Wouldn't pick LATAM in Brazil again there are better options available.

### "We weren’t disappointed"
❌ Not Verified |  Having heard good things about LATAM, we decided to pay some extra money and choose LATAM over other budget airlines which flew the exact route. We weren’t disappointed! Boarding was carried out in a very organized way, and the flight had no issues at all, which guaranteed us a complete good experience. The staff were friendly with all the passengers, and were very clear when indicating instructions. The food and drinks service was better than what you would expect at a 2.40 hours-long flight, and you could repeat your drinks if you wished. Even when we had to wait to exit the plane due to the Terminal in Santiago being crowded, the crew did an excellent job on keeping the passengers in their seats and calm.

### "Cabin is old design"
London to Sao Paulo. Complete Disaster from huge problem to check-in online. Latam is reviewing their reservation system since February 2018 and they can not make it work! Check-in at the Airport was a disaster, boarding the same with all people trying to get at the same time into the aircraft. Cabin is old design. My IFE didn’t work at all. Flight Attendant told me how unhappy they are since Latam Chile took over the Brazilian TAM.

### "certainly use them again"
Melbourne to Buenos Aires via Santiago. Checkin line was quite long and slow. However, the check-in agent was exceptional, well beyond what was expected. I was one of the last to board as l used the services of an airline lounge (Marhaba) which was well worth the entrance fee of $65. The economy cabin was totally full. Although this is low season l was surprised to see a full cabin. Cabin crew were quite attentive and smart in their blue uniforms . The aircraft cabin look very new and clean. To be expected for a relatively new B787. IFE was more than adequate with a very good mix of new release and other favourite shows, television and music options. Dinner and drinks were served soon after take off. Options were available and l chose the chicken which was a very good choice. Tasty indeed. The one issue l had with the cabin service was the time it took to clear our meal trays. I should point out one it is one of my biggest peeves and it becomes annoying when crew walk down the aisle noticing most pax have finished their meals yet seem to take their time clearing them. LATAM please take note! This is quite a long flight clocking in at 13.5 hours to SCL. I managed to get some sleep and wasn't too bothered missing out on breakfast. Landing was on time. I had a 3.5 layover for my connection to EZE. The connecting flight was smooth, on time and with a 00:55 departure, all l wanted was sleep. The cabin was more than half empty so it was very comfortable to spread out and rest. This was my first time with Latam and l will certainly use them again for flights to Latin America.

### "Disaster at Buenos Aires"
Buenos Aires to Lima. Disaster at Buenos Aires. To make a long story short, LATAM kept delaying my flight ( and many others) without any explanation or apology.Ultimately had to call their help centre 6 times to get a new flight to Lima 14 hours after my original departure time and had to be very persistent and aggressive about it. Only when I finally managed to talk to a Latam supervisor did I find out that my new flight, which, 1 hour before departure time, despite assurances from LATAM help centre and airport information line, actually did not exist. It was at a totally different time with a different flight number. No wonder the gate # never showed up on the airport monitors nor on Latam's website. Had to very forcefully drag info out of them. They behaved as if they were clueless.

### "A reliable service"
Puerto Maldonado to Lima. Flew a couple of internal flights LIM-JUL and PEM-LIM whilst on holiday in Peru. Both flights were full. Checking-in etc went smoothly and so did the boarding. LIM-JUL flight was on time, though flight time given will include the sitting and waiting on the tarmac at Lima airport. There was a an on-board trolley service to purchase food and drink on each flight - we didn't use it. FAs friendly, though don't expect much info in English:). For short flights it was comfortable enough, though no IFE system on either flight. Seating etc is what you can expect from such as aircraft, three in a row either side and I would say had adequate leg room. No issues with luggage, in fact quite a speedy delivery both times. Got us to our destinations safely and with friendliness. A reliable service in our experience.

### "Worst experience ever"
Buenos Aires to Cordoba. Worst experience ever, actually was unable to take the flight since the airline disclosed a gate for the flight and ended up departing from a different one. Airline staff even advised to go to the gate shown on the airport screens even though no one was there and we were really close to departure. Costumer support staff on social media advised to contact their call centre for an alternative flight after I ended up missing it, their CSR hung up on me and they did not even offer a hotel to spend the night since next flight departed 14 hours later. On the way to Buenos Aires I flew on the oldest plane I have ever flown, they are not joking when they say this airline's planes have a median age of almost 40 years!

### "I highly recommend "
I have flown with Latam before and was completely satisfied, but this time the excellence of their customer service especially impressed me. I was en route to Lima for a flight to Buenos Aiires. The traffic in Lima was an absolute nightmare and there was a serious risk I would miss my flight. I called Latam's helpline who did a stellar job: he checked me in and e mailed me a boarding pass (something which Aeromexico previously refused to do). I highly recommend Latam.

### "Tried to buy luggage"
Sao Paulo to Curitiba. Bought from UAE domestic ticket with their partner OneTravel. Tried to buy luggage together it says have to contact airline. Unable to find well specified on their website how to purchase it in advance. One day before the flight when go do check in online try to purchase 23 kg one luggage very hard to find. When put in google “buy luggage Latam” comes to webpage to purchase the first 23 kg for 40 US dollars instead of 40 BLR reais as its written in another page. Have to call my sister in Brazil, ask her to call a Latam agency and ask what is going on. They dont help at beginning until she insist and they send her the link to purchase it with the correct price. Me and my fiance who was coming to Brazil for the first time were very dissaponted with this airline as we feel, they are trying to take advantage of the foreigners who dont know their actual prices.

### "very poor customer service"
Santiago to Sydney via Auckland. LATAM offered my husband and I a travel voucher to delay our flight by 24 hours as they were overbooked. We felt this was a good deal at the time but I would warn other these vouchers are extremely difficult to use! We could not book online so called the call centre (very poor quality call centre) and spent over 60 minutes on the phone- paid for the tickets and then we were disconnected. Our tickets were never issued yet the payment was taken. The issue is not resolved with the airline over 1 week later and we can’t get through to anyone to sort the issue out. Very poor customer service from this airline.

### "not crediting my miles"
Barcelona to São Paulo. LATAM is not crediting my miles on my BA account every time I fly with them, even though my frequent flyer is on my ticket I have to call BA to get them credited. It is very annoying as I don't have the same problem with other OneWorld airlines. Worst, on my last business flight from São Paulo to Barcelona I couldn't get my miles credited at all, BA said it has been credited already in a different account even though my BA number is on the ticket! They suggested me to contact LATAM I did and they say the same thing, that it has been credited to my Latam account which I don't have and I don't want! The weird part is that my partner, who did a flight from Barcelona to Sao Paulo in different dates, had the same problem and he is AA frequent flyer, so LATAM is getting miles from OneWorld clients and given them to someone else!

### "gates can change a bit"
Iguassu Falls to Rio de Janeiro. Easy check in and far better than the chaos we had at Sao Paolo. Airport was small. However all that matters with these short domestic flights in my view is safety and punctuality. LATAM seems to deliver both. At bigger airports the gates can change a bit from that which you are originally told so you have to be aware. The flights I took all had at least one staff member who spoke English. Outbound flight had a chatty captain who kept us well informed.

### "Medium quality cabin service"
São Paulo to Brasília. Medium quality cabin service and actually very expensive snack. Cheap tickets are seldom available, but the airplanes are good and also clean. The internet site is the best among brazilian airlines.

### "very disappointing experience"
Sydney to Auckland. A very disappointing experience this time around, not that I was expecting other the top service but it was below average. To start off, the Check-In was slow as the Ground Team was more worried about having a briefing then prioritising the passengers. I wasn't given a fast track pass through security as they had none even when they seem to be organised. Upon boarding, again there was no priority for High Tiered and Premium passengers and main reason being it was a bus gate. The Crew onboard were very mediocre, absolutely no one stood out even with their extra touches. Pre-departure drinks took a long time to get around with a very basic amenity kit given straight after. The catering was okay nothing amazing with selections or taste. At least the IFE was decent, plenty of options though I couldn't compare it with Emirates offering. Overall I think the Team needs to be more personal, smile more and prioritise the passengers.

### "a drop in the quality of services"
Sao Paulo to Foz de Iguacu. Unfortunately in recent months there has been a drop in the quality of services offered by LATAM. From a faulty online booking system that has been in maintenance for months, as well as a total lack of motivation on the part of the employees, mainly in LATAM BRAZIL. At the check-in for passengers with Status Loyalty / Lanpass simply in Guarulhos there is no one, three employees chatting at check-in the lolzes understand the atmosphere of professionalism of the Company. Boarding via remote location. After takeoff the cabin crew disappears in the galleys and you can find them eating and talking. The on-board service, no free drinks - no free snacks (they are worse then US airlines), begins 30 minutes after take-off on a 1:25 flight. Notice the total lack of interest on the part of the crew in "selling" the products offered and disappear quickly into the Galley. In a market where there have been months of increasing criticism of Latam and services equivalent to a "low cost", there is a change from a corporate client to better companies in the market such as Avianca, Azul and Gol (the latter improving every time more). And at the end of the trip, a questionnaire is received from the LATAM President Customers Relations with a questionnaire to be pre-filled; sign that the company is concerned. I suggest checking why so many Premium customers are no longer flying with LATAM, and you are doing nothing to keep them.

### "really good flight"
Flew return trip to Easter Island from Santiago. Really good flight. Flight was 5 hours and the seats were comfortable. Food was good for airline food. Staff friendly and helpful. I even got a whiskey in the loo queue! The inflight films were a good selection and new films featured. If I was lucky enough to be in S America agin I would travel with LATAM

### "great food and beverage"
Late night departure out of Santiago to Auckland, Business class was about 1/2 full and crew very prompt in serving an excellent dinner and clearing so those who wanted to sleep could settle quickly. Within 90mins of departure a 4 course meal with great wines had been served and cleared. Breakfast served when you wanted it and I liked the menu card that let you make selections and build the breakfast. Business class on these 787 is in my opinion excellent. Good range of new release movies, professional crew, high quality quilts and pillows and comfortable beds, matched with great food and beverage. Premium check in area at SCL is excellent but hard to find if you weren't made aware in advance, I like how it leads directly to Latam's lounge. Lounge is fine, but with limited food options if you want to dine before flight.

### "it went to hell big time"
My wife and I have been flying Lan for about ten years. Lan used to be a very good airline, but after the merger with Tam it went to hell big time. The list of ordeals that we have experienced with LATAM are endless. They include one time when they completely lost the record of my wife's Business Class flight from LA to Lima. If you have to make a change in your ticket forget it. You will just have to buy a whole new ticket. I have lost numerous tickets because of that. Sometimes their change fees exceed the cost of the original ticket. Their customer service is the worst ever. If you have a problem their standard answer is that will open a "case. Then you never hear from them again. One time my wife (who is Peruvian) asked why they had not responded to a "case" that they had opened. They said that they would open a case to see why the "case had not been answered. If you go into a Lan office in Lima it is full of angry customers. One time my wife went into the office and bought a ticket. The agent booked it on the wrong day. Even there right in front of my wife she could not change it to the correct flight. She said that the computer would not allow her to do it. Another time we had a problem with one of my wife's purchased Business Class flights. We called Lan's Customer Service and were connected to one of their call centers in Columbia. The agent put us on "hold" except that he actually did not put us on hold. We could hear him laughing about my wife's problem in the background with some of the other agents. What kind of an airline is this? Unfortunately Lan has a government arranged monopoly on some domestic Peruvian routes. Another thing, Lan -- unlike any other airline in Peru -- charges more than double the fare for non-Peruvian residents. I just priced a flight for my wife and me: $80 for her and $196 for me.

### "They not approve what I said"
In a previous post I have described the total lack of onboard service in a 3 hours flight from REC to GRU. I was describing the bad online service of LATAM. They did not offer one glass of water. Having paid 300 USD for a OW ticket is too much! Meanwhile I was writing here I send an official complaint to LATAM via web form. Please read the kind of answer that I got "Dear Mr...... In addition to our sincere greetings, we are contacting you to offer our apologies for the attention received. We are sorry about the situation you described, and would like to manifest that our purpose is to provide a service of excellence, warm and humane. Therefore, we do not approve the way you describe you were attended. We thank you for the opportunity to provide an answer, and we look forward to assist you in the near future. LATAM do not approve the way you describe you were attended" I never got a rude answer like that. Unless the customer representative has taken the same flight with me how he can answer like that. Rather than answer "we are sorry for bla bla" They not approve what I said.

### "top price for a no-frills service."
Domestic flight (JJ3525) from Recife to Sao Paulo for approximately 3 hour flight. No service onboard at all (no a glass of water was offered), they just announced the so-called Mercaso Tam, a paid service for sandwiches etc. I'm not expecting caviar or champagne but I suggest LATAM to have a look at his domestic competitors like Avianca or Azul well above the market average. OW flight for 300 USD and no service at all. Narrow space for your leg. Before to be merged with LAN, TAM had a great service. Today you pay a top price for a no-frills service. My personal preference list is (value/money/service) 1) Avianca 2) Azul 3) GOL. Positive note: Check In desk in REC very professional and kind.

### "could not fault the service"
Auckland to Santiago on Latam (Qantas Ticket but LA aircraft) I could not fault the service, comfort or overall experience. It was excellent. Latam applies an "old school" spacing between the seats in J Class (787) and along with a very long flat bed there was a real sense of space and comfort. High quality duvet, pillow and seat encourages deep sleep. Food and wine was a high point and crew seem to take genuine pride in presenting Chilean fare and hospitality. Airlines and their crew should represent their culture and Latam was a great intro to Chile. Plane was full and crew to pax ratio was good, toilets always clean but tiny (that's the same in every Dreamliner). Latam does seem to get a lot of negative feedback on its regional flights but this long haul flight was worthy of 5 stars, only request - PJ's would be good! Bags took a while, but this was a conveyor belt issue and probably not Latam's fault.

### "avoid at all costs"
I was flying from Rio Branco  to Curitiba. When we were waiting for the flight to open, the information on screen changed to 'delayed', but no one cared to inform us. Only after an hour they called out the landing ground had been 'too wet' for the plane to land, and therefore we would have to wait for more information. It took another 1,5 hours before we heard that our flight was truly cancelled, so even though it was already clear we wouldn't be flying at 11 pm, action was undertaken only around 2 am. We then had to wait for 1,5 hour for vans to drive us to hotels in Rio Branco. They had ordered only 3 and we were with way too many people. If they had ordered more at 11, the progress would have been quicker. In the meantime, almost nobody spoke English, and the staff kept reassuring us that the vans would arrive in 10 minutes (which would mean at least 40 minutes). The worst experience, however, was with the online customer service. I wanted to do an online check-in, but I needed a Brazilian CPF for that, which I don't have because I'm Dutch. It took me literally 4 hours to make them answer me and even then they responded very inadequately, slowly, they misread my questions on purpose to give the wrong answers and they made me pay double for check-in at the airport because their website is not functioning properly. I'm still waiting for them to compensate the made expenses, but so far I'm not expecting anything anymore. Sidenote: their planes are not comfortable if you're taller than 1,60m and don't expect to be served any food or water. Long story short: if cancelled flights, extremely long waiting times and terrible customer service are your thing, go fly with LATAM! If not, avoid at all costs.

### "wonderful experience"
Paris to Buenos Aires via Sao Paulo. Excellent trip with this airline, my first time with them since LATAM was created. Onboard personnel are really professional, and flights took off and landed on time. To top it all I was unexpectedly promoted to business class on the last leg of my trip so that added to the wonderful experience flying with this airline. I'll definitely choose them again my next time to Europe

### "seats smaller than ever"
Melbourne to Santiago. Well it was a new aircraft which was great, but the seats are smaller than ever and only four bathrooms for the whole economy cabin! That's right just four! They ran out of meal options at both dinner and breakfast. If you don't speak Spanish, you are screwed, staff can speak some English but not well or patient enough. Worse, this was a Qantas coded flight and should have been so much better.

### "the more irritating they got"
I did some international (Santiago-Buenos Aires) and domestic flights in South America on LATAM. Their website is poor but generally I didn’t have much problems with their administration, although most flights had delays of some sort that were not handled well (the first flight was moved without notice to a 15 minute earlier departure and even boarded early but then we didn’t take off until 30 minutes after the original departure time). The staff were generally good - even though check-in is often confusing, staff were helpful and very fast. Some flights were on A320s - old fit out and no seat-back screens (you can stream entertainment from their app but there are no power points so battery life is an issue). The others were on 787s - much newer and roomier but with some strange design like the seat cushions moving around and having an uncomfortable gap at the back and the seat-back screens being fixed, so if the person in front reclines their seat, you have to watch at an angle. Short flights get just a drink, medium flights get snack food and the flights to Easter Island had full meals but they weren’t very good. Generally there’s no alcohol available (which must be a regional thing as I noticed it on Aerolineas as well) but strangely there was alcohol on the flight from Easter Island (but not the flight to Easter Island). Several flights used remote stands and buses, which is always horrible, but I didn’t think LATAM managed them very well, like holding up buses for staff. At boarding, they sometimes strictly enforced boarding by rows and sometimes completely ignored it. The more I flew them the more irritating they got but they’ll do the job and no other South American airlines seem to stand out.

### "working on your reimburse"
Buenos Aires to Guadalajara. This airline cancel my flight one day before, since December 18 i got an email telling me I will be reimburse my ticket in 45 days, well i am still waiting. I call every day and their answer is always the same "we are working on your reimburse". I check it out @latam_ch twitter and found several complains like mine, i really hope i get my money back.

### "lots of seat parts missing"
Santiago to Sao Paulo. LATAM´s website does not work. Could not check in online neither on callcenter because of a lack on the system. Santiago de Chile´s LATAM Lounge is big but with very low standards, only some strange sandwiches (at 2pm) and some other unrecognizable food. Boeing 767 amazingly dated. Overhead compartments did not close securely, old seats, and even older feeling and looks. As seen on the pictures, lots of seat parts missing! Filthy. Food looked like dogs breakfast, all served at once (in what they called business class)! Avoid LATAM. After a flight with Cathay Pacific you go from heaven to direct to hell.

### "racket to extort extra money"
Mexico City to Montevideo via Sao Paulo. My group was totally hustled / ripped off in Mexico City. After flying into Mexico City from Los Angeles on Alaska Airlines, and waiting in a line of literally 1000+ people in customs (just for an international connection to Sao Paulo, Brazil) we arrived at the ticket counter about an hour before the flight, waited in line for about 15 minutes, got to the ticketing agent, and were told that it was "impossible" for us to board our scheduled flight, because LATAM flights close 1 hour before flight time (who does this?). We were then told that the next flight would be 24 hours later, and that there was nothing they could do, other than charge us each another $270 for a "transfer fee" to get us on the flight the following day. We were there in time, in line, there were at least 4 employees at their computers and only 1 agent actually helping a customer at a time. They then referred us to the Hilton hotel in the airport, where we had to pay an additional $288 for a room that we were forced to get since they did not allow us our boarding passes, where we could have been at the boarding gate with a good 40-45 minutes to spare before wheels up. When boarding the flight the next day, I spoke with 2 boarding agents at the gate, and they said they close the flight routinely about 25-30 minutes before flight time. Thus, we would have easily made our original flight. After posting our dilemma on Facebook, I learned from several people that LATAM has a HISTORY of doing this to others. And after reading reviews from several different sites, it seems to be very true. This appears to be some sort of racket, and I want to know how LATAM is willing to compensate for the additional almost $400USD that I was forced to spend due to deception and flat out lies we were told. In addition, in the other legs of my trip flying on LATAM, we would be told to go to a certain gate, Gate 4 for example. There would be all the passengers sitting in front of gate 4 waiting for boarding agents to arrive. Not too long before the flight was supposed to leave, there was still no LATAM employees there at the gate we were told to be at. After checking the flight monitors again, we would discover that the gate number had been changed to Gate 17. There was no announcement by LATAM regarding the gate change, no LATAM employees at the original gate to let us know that the gate had changed, and thus there were dozens of passengers running through the airport trying to get to the new gate and not miss the flight. What the hell is going on over there? This happened twice in our return trip; once in Montevideo, Uruguay, and again in Santiago, Chile. I hope that LATAM understands the severity of this negligence, and is willing to make up for it. LATAM doesn't give a damn about their customers, and is involved in a racket to extort extra money from their customers, especially in Mexico City.

### "cabin staff were very friendly"
London to Sao Paulo. The check-in and boarding went very well and quick. The plane was quite old, it had a horrible smell like urine. At first, I thought it was just me who noticed the smell but other passengers were complaining too. We all thought the smell was coming from the lavatories but realised that it was the plane that had the horrible odour. The seats looked old and dirty. After several hours into the flight, I had become nose blind and had forgotten about the smell. The rest of the flight was pleasant, the plane wasn't fully booked there were quite a lot of empty seats. I had an empty row for myself which was great. The food was really good and cabin staff were very friendly.

### "airplanes were old, dirty, loud"
Milan to Santa Genoveva via Sao Paulo. On the way there it was Milan to São Paulo and on the way back it was São Paulo to Paris. This review counts for both flights. The only thing that is saving this airline from getting a 1 star review is the fact that the staff (ground and flight) is very friendly and tries to help. Both airplanes were old, dirty, loud and poorly serviced. Many of the entertainment screens weren't working, there was garbage and gum in the seat pocket, the tray tables were brown and broken, the toilets were not cleaned during the flight, which was quite a disgusting find when after 11h I had to use the toilet. On the B773 usually the outer rows of seats have 2 floor mounts, which are intelligently placed between the three seats, and therefore don't disturb leg space. On the LATAM B773 there are three floor mounts, which are positioned exactly were your legs want to be and therefore reduce the legs a lot. If that isn't enough, LATAM installed a footrest on every seat (which is literally a net that lays on the floor) so the leg space is reduced even more! On a 12h flight we were served dinner with one drink just after takeoff (one hot dish and a little sweet snack, no brad, no butter, nothing else), and then breakfast just before landing (a small fruit salad and something to go with it). For the remaining duration of the flight, the cabin crew hid in the galley with the curtains closed. I attached a picture of the safety card, which basically sums up what the cabin looks like. I do not recommend this airline, not even for domestic flights.

### "nice staff, no delays"
Madrid to Frankfurt. I take this flight at least once a month and look forward to this. The Boeing 787 is real nice. Good atmosphere, nice staff, no delays. You only get a small sandwich for lunch, but free food, language and drinks on a EUR45 flight is pretty good. Would be nice if they offered WiFi on short haul.

### "I will be using an alternative airline"
We had booked to fly from Flrianopolis to London on 22nd December. I have flown with TAM/LATAM for 7 years and a gold frequent flyer member. When we arrived in Florianopolis for the flight having downloaded our boarding passes 2 days before with assigned seat numbers we were told that there was a problem with the aircraft(1st lie) on the London leg and cancelled our reservation. The local LATAM sales staff said they could route us via Casablanca to London with Royal Air Maroc (2nd Lie) and they tagged our luggage accordingly. We checked in for the booked flight to Sao Paulo. When we arrived in Sao Paulo we looked at the Departures board and there was no problem with the flight to London and Royal Air Maroc knew nothing of the reservation. We were kept at Sao Paulo until 2.00 am until our luggage was recovered. Whilst waiting there were 6 other passengers who had had their tickets cancelled because the London Flight had been overbooked. We were then booked on to the BA flight (much better service) the following day. Due to next day arrival in London my booked rental car was no longer available and I was faced with upgrade costs as it was now Christmas Eve. LATAM have refused to pay any compensation because their staff in Sao Paulo put as a reason for missing the original London Flight as a delay in the connecting flight (3rd Lie). I have followed their complaints procedures and made suggestions to settle the claim to no avail. As a regular traveller between Brazil and London they were presented options for future flights to settle my grievances amicably but to no avail. It appears that talking to the other passengers that had their tickets cancelled they all tell the same story. It is clear that LATAM use this form of fabrication of the truth to avoid paying out compensation for their continuing policy of overbooking flights. So much so for their Loyalty programme that clearly counts for nothing and as to their call centre based in Columbia they are a complete waste of time. Rest assured that in future I will be using an alternative airline.

### "made our experience a terrible one"
Arequipa to Cuba via Lima. Me and my friend used Latam Peru this summer in our trip from Cuba-Lima and Arequipa-Lima and Lima-Cuba again. The flight attendants are ok, but that was all it was ok about their flights! The nightmare started with a 2 hours delay, after we got to our destination, they have lost my friends suitcase. Once we got to the info point, no surprise, no one talked english (lucky we speak ok spanish) after hours of waiting.. they did not provide any funding to help us with the situation. When they finally find the luggage 3 days later, stuff was missing. On our second flight, they didn't lost our luggage anymore, but we did not know that when you buy your tickets there is the separation between a citizen of Peru and all the other countries. So even though they asked for our citizenship when we bought the tickets, there was no message that the tickets we are about to buy can just be used by peruvian citizens. Therefore when we got to the airport was a huge fine of 250 euros each was waiting for us, because we bought the wrong tickets. The alternative was to cancel our flight without a refund.. In other words, i don't wish to anyone the experience we had with Latam, they made our experience in South America a terrible one.

### "attentive, polite, very professional"
Fourteen hour daylight flight from Santiago Chile to Melbourne with LATAM. Very good cabin crew, attentive, polite, very professional. Good IFE although movies could be more up to date. Lunch served after take off. Menu quite interesting although portions seem to have been reduced. No more small salad, no more bread roll, no more desert (except for a small, packaged, piece of cake). Good Chilean wines and plenty of drinks all round. Drinks and food available in the galley throughout the flight.

### LATAM Airlines customer review
Flew LATAM from Auckland to Santiago. Very efficient checkin by Air New Zealand staff. Organized boarding by rows, plenty of bin space for hand luggage. Very attentive staff, food choices interesting but could be more substantial. Good IFE. Plenty of snacks and drinks available in the galley during the 10 hour flight. Booked "extra space seat" for US$50, well worth the extra charge.

### "very poor service received"
Lima to Iquitos. First, it was LAN Chile, an excellent airline with superb service (nice food, games, extras, etc.). Then it changed to LAN Peru, the service was not that good anymore, but decent. After years of travelling in LAN,  the airline is now called LATAM (a merge between LAN and Brazilian TAM). First, the trip was two hours delayed. Then, we could not choose our seats, so I was in row 1 and my friend in row 19. They did not give us any newspaper to read and no food, not even peanuts, pretzels or a glass of water. The "entertainment online" offered assumes you have a smart device with you (with enough space and batteries) and it also assumes that you had previously downloaded their app at the gate (do they have Wi-Fi there? , did somebody told you this before entering the plane?). So, it was one of the most boring trips! Fortunately, it was a 1.5 hour trip, but taking into account the initial plane's delay and the fact that you have to be two hours in advance at the airport, we ended up our trip starving. On the return flight, my friend and I got stocked-up with drinks, food, candy, magazines, and so on. The trip was quite expensive even! Definitely, no comparison between the high price of the plane ticket and the very poor service received. I can't imagine a longer trip with this airline.

### "imitation of customer service"
Bogota to Buenos Aires. Well, no points for this airline, I have a ticket (for my partner), the amount for the ticket was charged to my credit card, and LATAM annulled the ticket without any notification. They have withheld the funds charged to my credit card, denied service, required me to deal with their inept "call centre", complete with poor audio, mumbling service representatives who pass customers from one clown to another in a pathetic imitation of customer service, without offering any kind odd solution. Never again.

### "refused to allow this"
Santiago to Isla de Pascua. LATAM has the worst costumer service I have experienced. I was originally flying from Santiago to Cusco with a layover in Lima. Due to extenuating circumstances, I had to return to the USA early and I did not use my ticket from Santiago to Lima but was able to get a flight from the USA to Lima so as to catch my original flight from Lima to Cusco. LATAM refused to allow this and forced me to cancel the entire flight. I called them to inform them of my plan and was not asking for any sort of refund and they denied me the ability to do this. I will never fly with them again and don't recommend ever booking with them.

### "the crew were quite amazing"
Overall a great experience on this newly established direct flight from Santiago to Melbourne with Latam's new fleet of Dreamliners. For this long stretch Latam opts for the 900 Series providing the capacity for a 13.5-15 hr flight spending on direction of winds. Check-in in Santiago was super easy. The exclusive business check-in area is situated at level 3 of the airport, which is also where the VIP lounge is located. It took all of 5 minutes to check-in and go through the VIP passport and security control leading you directly into a very large lounge spread over 2 floors. Boarding commenced approx. 45 minutes before departure and doors were closed near enough at our scheduled departure time. To our surprise the scheduled 15 hour flight was reduced to 13.2 hrs. For me the layout of the 800 Series is nicer, but again no issue with the 900 Series. In-flight staff during the entire 13+ hr flight was non stop just looking after us, truly the busiest crew I have seen for a long time. We got dished out a lunch, a snack and a dinner approx. 2 hours before arrival. The food standards are OK, but not to compare to Singapore or Emirates. Even though an espresso pod machine should have been available, it was somehow out of action, which was disappointing. The South American wines are worth trying. Reds from Chile are amazing. Headphones are not the best in the air, with little or no noise cancellation benefits. No PJ's provided and the small amenity kit is also just OK, a trend with most airlines and why not as most of it ends up in the bin. On our flight no newspaper or magazine was available in English, a bit of a shame. The crew forgot to hand out migration forms and after asking 1 hr before landing I was told they had none on board. Minutes later they hastily started handing them out, however the crew wasn't familiar with the Australian requirements for each person to have a in-coming migration/customs form completed (both sides). Families were told only one per person was required. Further, business class passengers did not receive an Express card, which allows you to fast track passport and customs check-points. To add to this you can't use smart gates, as you must answer a question where you spend most time at and most South American countries prevent you to enter via the smart gates. Even though luggage was priority tagged our 4 cases had the pleasure to arrive right at the end. Back to the inflight experience, I mentioned to the purser that the right hand front toilet randomly would flush (also when you are sitting on it, which is a rather strange experience) and that the left hand lavatory had a faulty water tap, which was running non stop. After such a long day in the sky the purser wasn't really interested and told me the water tap issue is linked to the aircrafts hydraulics and it always happens at the start (2 hrs into the flight?) and yes the other toilet had a sensitive switch (clearly very sensitive as I never even touched it and it happened a few times). Aircraft Reg: CC-BGF in case Latam wants to get these items fixed. Overall the flight was great with amazing glimpses of the Antarctica, the crew were quite amazing and we arrived well in Melbourne without having to stop-over in Auckland NZ and sit there for 6 hours, so thank you Latam.

### "no transparency with the customers"
Flew LATAM Airlines from Montreal to Lima via New York. Worst company you could ask for! Absolutely no transparency with the customers, they had us stuck in the airport providing absolutely no explanation for 20 hours, telling us the flight will be there shortly every few hours. We later learned that the crew had actually left the airport hours ago. On arrival they lost all our luggage. Wouldn't have been bad except the fact they never delivered as promised, gave us phone numbers that are no longer in service and never returned any of our calls/emails. Our vacation ended up being ruined as we couldn't get out of the city so we could have a chance to recover our stuff. They never made a single move towards us.

### "the service was spot on"
Lima to Santiago. Our first flight on Latam’s fleet of Boeing 787 and in fact our first flight on Latam in a wide bodied aircraft. We arrived at the business check-in counter and the usual annoying thing happened as ground staff wanted to redirect us to the economy section. Such a simple thing to manage by simply saying please come through into our business class area. Check-in was quick as expected. There is no Latam or partner lounge in Lima and we received 3 x US$ vouchers for 3 different food places within the terminal. We did run out of time, so never used them. Boarding the Boeing 787  is very exciting as the ceiling height is massive. Latam operates 2+2+2 configuration with ample space to reach your seat even it is the window seat. Whilst a short flight, the service was spot on. The purser introduced herself and overall inflight staff was in a pleasant way managing the cabin. Shortly after take off we were offered a decent breakfast and after having cleared away the trays, the crew arranged for a comfy duvet and large pillow. Windows got electronically dimmed. The choice of in-flight entertainment was excellent along with the screen size, whilst quite away from you. Head phones are not the best in the industry - maybe something Latam should upgrade to complete the overall great experience.

### "don't waste your money with them"
I had a dreadful experience with LATAM Airlines on my last trip. I had a flight from Bogota to Buenos Aires, stopping in Sao Paulo. 1 hour before boarding the plane I was told the flight was oversold, therefore they would have to send me on a direct trip with another airline. They offered a monetary compensation to people who were interested in changing their flight. When I asked if I was going to receive that too, they said no because my flight was leaving in an hour, which was a lie because it ended up leaving 3 hours after the original one. The new flight was taking me to a different airport which was 45 km (27 miles) away from the original one. That was a major inconvenience for me. They told me they would take care of my baggage internally with the other company. When I arrived to Buenos Aires my luggage never appeared. I spoke with people from both companies but no one knew anything. I demanded to speak with a supervisor, who made a call and found out that my luggage was in Aeroparque, the original Airport which I was supposed to arrive to. In the end they sent me in a cab to Aeroparque to get my luggage but they did not take responsibility over anything, didn't give me any compensation and not even an apology. I don't recommend anyone to use this airline, don't waste your money with them.

### "Very old aircraft"
Sao Paulo to Rio de Janeiro. Old torn seats. Not even water was offered. Very old aircraft as all of Latam´s standards. Took this picture to show how old and bad mantained the aircraft was, seat on the emergency seat (11F) was broken.

### "do not fly Latam"
Sydney to Auckland. Typical disorganised South American airline. If you can put up with late departure, poor web features and poor options with dealing with their tardiness then knock your self out and buy a Latam ticket. I flew with them a few months back and even though on line check in is available it's basically useless get ready for a round the corner wait at the airport. Even so then I noted to self do not fly Latam again I bought the same route again. Received an email today flight is delayed 7 hours! Ok so please book me on another airline. Sorry we have a flight next day so can't do. Ok please book me on the next day. Sorry fully booked. Please refund me sorry that will cost you $120. All this over a phone line that sounds like it's connected through a fish pond. Every time I called the same appalling audio quality. Then you get sent "offers" and are asked to use their app. Virtually none of these features work. You can't sign up as it will not accept your passport number. Most of the links do not work on other features. Hence the very frustratiing conversation through the fish pond. Can I speak to a supervisor. Sorry no you can call back and try another person like me.

### "felt more like premium economy"
Miami to Rio de Janeiro. The Boeing 767-300 plane was old and smelly and not well cleaned. Seats were tight with torn fabric as seen in the photograph attached. In general not very comfortable. Crew members were attentive and the flight was generally without problems. It felt more like premium economy than business.

### "waited in line for hours"
Galapagos to Quito. We arrived at the airport at Baltra several hours early. Shortly before the aircraft was to take off, many of the passengers confronted the ground crew at the gate. The passengers had received emails to indicate that the flight had been canceled. The ground crew were unaware. We waited in line for hours to find out about a flight the next day. We had to go back by bus, ferry and bus to Puerto Ayora to be registered into a hotel. We were told to wait a half hour for a bus to take us to dinner but it was over an hour. We ate dinner at 10 PM. The hotel they chose lost electricity before we went to bed. The whole operation was poorly managed. We lost an entire day. While waiting to take off on the revised flight the next morning, some passengers were offered compensation while others were not. We were not. I filed a complaint via email with the airline and they said that they were not prepared to provide any compensation.

### "This is not a fair treatment"
Cusco to Lima. We were already warned for the fact that LATAMAirlines asks tourist to pay a higher rate for a domestic flight within Peru. When booking the flight on the English website, it was indicated that we could buy the second fare rate. I do not remember the 3 options (cheapest, a bit more expensive and highest rate), but indeed we saw that we were not able to book the cheapest flight as this is only for Peruvian nationals. After booking the flight and a happy check in at Cusco airport, a staff informed us about the fact that we booked a Peruvian fare ticket. I explained her the fact that we already knew. She showed us the Spanish webiste of Latam which is different from the English version. There it said that tourist can only buy the highest rate. This is not clear on the English website, besides that, the English website asks a few times for you nationality and passport number, so it could also have warned us. Which would be more customer friendly. After lengthy discussions, where staff even indicated that we are stupid and made a mistake, that was not a pleasant experience. We were able to not pay the fine of USD 177 (insane amount!) but the difference between the fares. She did not show us the calculation we just had to pay USD 121 in total. This is not a fair treatment as we already paid a higher fare for our tickets to Lima.

### "Flight Manager was the worst"
Frankfurt to Sao Paulo. What disappoints me is the up and down on LATAM service. Flight was late due to weather conditions, this is OK and your cannot complain against the airline. Boarding was really terrible, no Business Class priority, no Infants Priority - get everybody fast inside an Airport bus. Cabin Crew okay, but Flight Manager was the worst I have ever seen, so aggressive. On Board service below an acceptable standard, Dinner was cold, breakfast Omelette Cold! Arriving in Sao Paulo and over 300 passengers trying to catch a Airport bus to the Main Terminal.

### "cabin and seats comfy and IFE good"
I was unable to check in online as my ticket was on Iberia paper and as an Iberia code share flight number. So much for seamless One World. Check in at Santiago airport was painfully slow. However, once that was over, boarding was efficient, cabin and seats comfy and IFE good (although not was varied as when was only LAN). We left on time and after crossing the Andes it was time for the new dinner service. This is a radical change with one main dish (30 % larger than the norm) accompanied by a bread roll and a biscuit. Choice of 3 - meat, fish or vegetarian. Food was excellent. Overnight there was a larder in the rear galley with drinks, sandwiches and ice cream. You could also ask for eye shades, ear plugs, travel socks or a tooth brush and toothpaste. Breakfast was a choice of hot omelette or sweet pancake accompanied by yogurt or fresh fruit. All very good. Crew were attentive and friendly. Overall very good - apart from check in.

### "not helpful, pleasant or friendly"
Flew LATAM Airlines from Sao Paulo to Paris CDG. Flight delayed. No information. Missed my connection. Multiple passengers booked to same seating. Flight attendants not helpful, pleasant or friendly. Food quality bad. In-flight movies did not work and ear phones were very bad quality. My bag arrived a day later this time and 7 days late the previous occasion. I did fly with LATAM before and it was bad as well. I did not complain then as it may have been a once off. I though I would try them again. Never again!

### "nice full-flat seats"
Sao Paulo to Paris. Another great flight with LATAM. Fast check-in, great Lounge at São Paulo airport. On time boarding, great crew. This aircraft has nice full-flat seats, the crew provided a good service. Arrival on time, fast-lane through immigration and fast luggage delivery. Good wine options during Dinner.

### "involuntarily removed from a flight"
This was not the first time that I have flown with LATAM. However, this is by far the worst experience I have had with any airline in the past. We intentionally purchased two tickets with a long layover in Bogota, Colombia from San Andres to Cali, Colombia. However, when we arrived at the airport in San Andres for our return flight, we found out that they had given up our seats without our volunteering nor did they offerer any incentive. We let them know that we paid more than double the price for the tickets in order to have a longer layover. However, the representative tried to force us on the plane with a direct flight to Cali. We asked to speak to a manager, however he never arrived and the representative called for the police. The police officer was polite. However, she kept telling us that there was nothing that the airline could do. We waited over 3 hours to be placed on a flight with another airline, where we had a shorter layover in Bogota. However, once we arrived and rushed to the terminal, we found out the flight had been delayed. In Bogota the service was better considering it was an inconvenience and had we known about the layover earlier, we could have made arrangements to continue the original plans we had for Bogota. I would also like to mention, this is not the first time that there have been delays in Bogota as this seems to now be the norm. I am accustomed to airlines offering incentives to volunteer seats, never have I been involuntarily removed from a flight and had a police officer try to force me on another one.

### "service not up to par"
Flew São Paulo to London Heathrow with LATAM Airlines. This was a night flight, check in was fast as we were transiting from Rio. The plane was pushed back on time, taxied to the end of runway and then returned to the gate as there was a malfunction of the air conditioning, we were kept informed of the possible delay, eventually flight took off at about 01.30 about 2 hours late, but arrived just half an hour late at LHR. Aircraft was clean, but service not up to par! Most pax went to sleep as the flight was delayed, the first meal we were offered was breakfast an hour before landing, solid 10 hours after we took off. The breakfast was omlette and fruits, the fruit juice was more like flavoured water than fruit juice, the service was inconsistent, juice being served in plastic cups but coffee in proper mugs! Was expecting a substantial breakfast as it was the only meal served but was disappointed.They provided a duvet which you could use either to lay down or as blanket? The business class seats are in 2-3-2 lay out, and extremely narrow though they were lye flat. LATAMS 767 and 787 all have 2-2-2 lay out which is more comfortable and less crowded, probably getting as many seats as possbile in business section. Would I fly with them again: not sure?

### "Plane needs to be updated"
Buenos Aires to Sao Paulo. Fast Check in at the Ezeiza Airport in Buenos Aires, got fast through security and Immigration. Lounge is nice with good choices of food and beverages at 3AM in the morning. Fast boarding. Plane needs to be updated. Business Class seat at this type of aircraft are not really spacious. Cabin Crew have done their work very fast but all crew had a nice smile! Meal & Beverage were OK. Arrived on time with fast luggage deliver

### "Cabin Crew was outstanding"
Santiago to Buenos Aires. Fast Check-In, Great Lounge at Santiago de Chile, had a nice shower and staff were very helpful and friendly. Boarding was on-time and fast. Business Cabin was really old Style and shows its age. Food was below standard but the Wine List had good Argentinean & Chilean Wines. On this flight the Cabin Crew was outstanding.

### "excellent experience"
Sao Paulo to Santiago. Excellent experience from the check-in to arrival. Clean aircraft, polite cabin crew did their job with efficiently without great exaggerations. Service within the expected pattern. It would be great if all flights with LATAM maintained this level.

### "mediocre service and quality"
Santiago to Temuco. LATAM Rules of carry on luggage were changed without communication. Furthermore, the rules were applied randomly among passengers, for some applied stricter than for others. Besides that there was unfriendly service on the ground at port of departure. Overall mediocre service and quality.

### "not hesitate to fly LATAM again"
My wife and I flew from Auckland to Sydney on flight LA801 on 17th November which happened to be my 50th birthday. Upon check in at Auckland my wife told the lady who checked us in that it was my 50th birthday and would it be possible for an upgrade. Little did we know that we got upgraded to premium economy and I got messaged happy birthday on my seat screen then wished happy birthday by  the chief flight attendant then given a lovely little gift of chocolates in a lovely signed cup and card and once again wished happy birthday by her and 3 other flight attendants and asked if there was anything else I would want. By now I was feeling quite royal! I cannot thank the cabin crew enough for such a memorable flight. The return flight home to Auckland in standard economy was also very comfortable and flight staff very helpful and friendly Considering this was the first time we ave flown LATAM airlines we would not hesitate to fly LATAM again.

### "seats were comfortable"
Flew Santiago to Easter Island. The Dreamliner we flew on both ways seemed very new and clean. The seats were comfortable and had adequate legroom to avoid knee scraping, though maybe that’s because I’m not unusually tall. The IFE was pretty good with a reasonable selection of films and TV and a video screen that was clean and unscratched. The food was quite good for economy. On the way out it was morning and we were given breakfast of an omelette and “roast potatoes”. The potatoes were a bit under-roasted but the omelette was good. The flight back was in the afternoon and we were given lunch, which again was good and this time came with wine if you wanted it. After the stewardess had collected the empty trays, she returned offering “water, juice, tea, coffee, whisky.” “Er, did you say whisky?” Yes! And I got a generous glass of Ballantines. The LATAM staff we encountered were all very helpful and friendly. Although I didn’t notice at the time, seats were allocated as soon as you have paid for the ticket, so presumably on a first come, first serve basis. We were quite happy with the two we got, a window and aisle (yes, next to each other) just behind the wing.

### "has deteriorated significantly"
Pucallpa to Lima. LATAM, previously LAN in Peru, used to be an excellent airline but their service has deteriorated significantly in the last year. The latest sign of their downward spiral is the increase in flight delays and cancellations. They are constantly delaying domestic flights, almost on a whim, and display no regret or sincere apology to their paying customers. The personnel is entitled, condescending and rude, treating customers like inconveniences. Not to mention that they charge for everything. I've tried to remain with them out of loyalty to LAN and in hopes that they might show the high quality of customer service as they did in the past, but I believe it's time to move on. I cannot in good faith recommend LATAM to anyone. They are not worth our money.

### "they cancel my flight twice"
Buenos Aires to Bariloche. First, they cancel my flight twice as it was not full and packed all the people in a later plane, 6 hours later. When finally boarded the plain, there was a technical issue and we need to get off and two hours later get into another plane. No compensation was offered and the staff was not seen anywhere. Very bad airline.

### "customer service is bad"
Flew Los Angeles to Santiago. This is the first time I taken LATAM and last. Their customer service is bad, takes forever to get a hold of anyone, and is a complicated system, plus all representatives have different responses. I was already at my destination when I received an email a day before my trip saying one of my connections was cancelled. My whole itinerary had to changed, one was spending all day in Peru with a kid, another one was going to conflict with my work, and the one that could had somewhat work meant taking time away from my family, that I haven't seen in years. Long story short I had to buy 2 new tickets from Delta to get my town, because LATAM made me miss my connection and now they don't want to refund me for those tickets. I do not recommend LATAM.

### "worst airline I have flown with"
Rio de Janeiro to Foz do Iguacu. This was the absolute worst airline I have flown with. My Brazilian friend and I had plans to go to Iguassu Falls together. She lives in Rio and was just going to go straight to the airport there. I was in Florianopolis and I was going to fly into Rio and then catch the same flights as my friend to go Iguassu Falls. I bought both of our tickets. My flight to Rio was a little bit late so I had to run to my gate and check-in there. I went to the gate, gave them my flight details with the code on it and gave them my passport. They printed off a ticket, gave it to me, and asked where the passenger was (my friend). She hadn't checked in yet. I asked them if they could call her on the intercom to see if she was even in the airport, they couldn't/wouldn't. My phone wasn't working and so I couldn't call her. I waited and waited until the last possible minute to board. She didn't show up (which was weird because around 5 hours earlier when I had an internet connection she told me that she was heading to the airport). I decided to board the plane and see if maybe we could get her on a later flight that same day. I got to the Iguassu Falls airport and I tried to get a hold of her. I called Latam and the airport in Rio and they couldn't give me any information. I tried calling her and it wasn't going through, so I decided to go to the hotel where I would at least have free wifi to try and call her. When I got to my room I was finally able to talk to her. Apparently she got to the airport around the same time I did and tried to check-in, but someone had already checked in as her? That's when I looked closely at my ticket, they gave me my friends ticket! How that was possible I don't know because I gave them my passport. I am very much American with a very American name and my friend is very Brazilian with a very Brazilian name. My friend was even held in Airport Security until they could verify that she really was her. They weren't even able to get her on another flight or give me a refund. When I got back to the US I called Latam to try and get a refund for my friends ticket since we weren't able to use it. The first guy said that he wasn't authorized to give me a refund, so he said a different representative would call me in a few hours to review my case with me (whatever that means). Someone did call back a few hours later who spoke very little English and was not able to help me at all. This was a total lack of security on there part.

### "very disappointed with LATAM"
Our flight was canceled. JJ 8009. September, 21 th, 2017. The airplane should take off at 11:30 a.m. Therefore, we arrieved at the Aeroparque airport very early. We were informed that this flight was delayed. When this flight appeared on the screen with the departure time at 00:30 p.m., we went to the queue. We stayed there, waiting to board, for a long time. Without any information. Absolutly none. When we asked about, the answer was always the same "we don't know. In 20 minutes, we will give you news". We were tired and hungry and the "news", did not come. Finally we learned that aircraft had technical problens. It was around 3 p.m. I and my sister paid for a lunch. Later LATAM reported that the flight had been canceled. No information was announced using a microphone or by an employee, to direct passengers. The news we had, was from the information desk and from other passengers. Finally they told us, the flight was canceled. They offered a snack ticket to passengers. This ticket was for a spoiled salad. I and my sister didn't eat it. Information was very mismatched. We had to cancel our check in, return to immigration and pick up our luggage. The airport staff were angry and treated us poorly. At night we went to a hotel. But we had to wait for the driver who would take us to Ezeiza airport at 00:30 a.m. In the Ezeiza airport we had to do the check in again. On both flights, JJ8008 when we went form Guarulhos to Buenos Aires and the back JJ9604, replacing the JJ8009, we were served bread that was clearly stale. We were completly tired, without comfort and lost our bus from São Paulo to Londrina. Besides of this, we had to pay a fee to rebook the bus tickets. I' m very, very disappointed with LATAM. I had never experienced such a bad situation on a trip.

### "Daylight robbery. Shockingly bad"
Lima to Quito. My wife and I travelled from UK to Lima on 25 June staying overnight in Lima where we checked in on-line for our flight to Quito the following day and printed our boarding passes. On arrival at the airport at 0645 for a 0900 departure we tried to do one bag drop. We were refused entry to the bag drop queue and were ordered to go and book another ticket. No reason was given. We believe the flight was overbooked and we were singled out because we were foreign. LATAM sales then demanded we purchase a full fare return ticket, even though we showed the Sales Agent we had a valid return ticket. We had flown to South America for a once in a lifetime visit to Galapogos. We had no choice but to pay a hugely inflated price for a ticket we had already purchased. We were told by LATAM sales management in Quito we should be refunded our improperly sold ticket. On check-in at Quito, the check-in Manager used our originally purchased tickets for the flight. We have made a formal complaint to LATAM on our return to UK twice, no refund permitted. Daylight robbery. Shockingly bad. Never again will we fly LATAM.

### "it was very dirty"
This was the first directly flight from Punta Arenas to Concepcion. When I arrive to my seat it was very dirty, the floor, the tray table and also the seat cushion. After takeoff I went to the toilet. When I was walking I see the floor, it was terrible! I don't know what it costs them to clean.

### "ground staff was unhelpful"
LATAM still needs to do more to recognise OneWorld elite members and business class passengers to become a premium airline, especially its domestic ground/airport staff. Services for OneWorld elite and business class passengers do not seem to be their culture. Flight from London to São Paulo was pleasant. The seat was not lie flat but comfortable. Old 2-2-2 layout. Food good. Nightmare started when landing in Sao Paulo transiting to Rio. The LATAM connection line from T3 Int’l to T2 domestic had more than 300 people queuing, all coming from different morning flights, but there was no priority check in for business class passengers or OneWorld emerald members. The priority was for physically disadvantaged only. The ground staff was unhelpful. Passengers choked at this point but the staff was unable to advice or redirect us. In fact people can go to T2 for a short walk upstairs to check in there too instead of waiting at these connection desks between T3&T2 for 3 hours. Encountered similar situations for the next 3 more domestic flights again. The LATAM check in priority lanes for OneWorld elite members had no English signage and accepted all passengers. The check in at CGH domestic took more than an hour. The “preferential” boarding lanes were there but often not in use. In spite of these observations, LATAM flights are generally very good and on time, and I have met so many amazing and helpful LATAM staff in São Paulo and Rio airports and in flights.

### "great first experience "
Sydney to Auckland. This has to be my best Business Class flight to date. From what I saw at Check In, it was slightly confusing for some passengers as there was no clear signs indicating where to line up, plus the Business queue took a bit longer then necessary. After I passed security and passport control, I went  to the Qantas Business Lounge for breakfast. Flight did not depart until 11:10 am but we boarded 1 hour prior to departure. Once onboard, the service was incomparable to any Business Class service I've had to date. Crew were friendly and engaging. They offered to take pictures for me and I was the only passenger to be offered champagne. The 787-9 Business Cabin was spacious with plenty of room to move around, though I prefer a 1-2-1 layout, I think the 2-2-2 form was adequate for short journeys. The food offered was above average and though I prefer a menu, I can understand that it was only a 2.5 hour flight and having one was not necessary. IFE was had good options but not on par with Qantas or Emirates. Overall, a great first experience with Latam plus the plane itself was very quiet which made the journey calm and relaxing.

### "had hoped fluency in English could be expected"
Flew Sao Paulo to London Heathrow. I rather expected the flight attendants on a BA codeshare to be more prepared to speak English. After boarding a FA addressed me in rapid Portuguese and, when I asked for "English? she simply shook her head and addressed the passenger in the seat adjacent to me. This seemed to be something relevant to our seating arrangements, so I was slightly uncomfortable at being shut out of the loop. Later in the flight the same FA gave me water after I asked for "a glass of wine. I understand I was travelling from Brazil, but since British Airways had put their name to the flight I had hoped fluency in English could be expected. In our (mostly gesticulatory) communications the FAs were very pleasant, mind, and so I suspect this is more to lay at OneWorld/BAs door than LATAMs.

### "a very pleasant flight"
Sydney to Auckland. LATAM is using a wide-body jet on this route and thus offers a long haul business class with an appealing cabin design and a 2x2x2 seating arrangement. The seats can be turned into a full flat bed. The service was friendly and attentive. One small, but tasty meal was served: I had a salmon quiche, a salad and a cake for desert. One point I did not like was that the cabin was held rather dark for a short day flight, and it seems that this is controlled centrally in a B787 because the windows are darkened automatically. Overall, however, it was a very pleasant flight and good value for money.

### "service level is getting worse"
Johannesburg to Sao Paulo. Business Class Meals were below any level. Have choosen for Dinner the Grilled Shrimp with Grilled Polenta and Asparagus. The attached picture says everything, 3 little shrimps and the asparagus have been replaced by two thin green beans. Since LAN took over the former TAM in Brazil service level is getting worse in Business Class every flight I take.

### "The seat was alright"
Flew TAM Airlines from Madrid to Sao Paulo. A new airplane, the A350. I was impressed by the friendliness of the cabin crew. The seat was alright, not as cramped as Air France B777 nor as big a TAP A330. The IFE was a big disappointment, as there were very few movies and songs available. It was a night flight and I could sleep relatively well. The food portions were very small. I would fly again as long as they offer better fares. Normally the best value to fly to South America remains to be Iberia. I cannot say my ticket was cheap for economy class.

### "I would never fly LATAM again"
Buenos Aires to Iguazu. If you fly with Latam arrive at least 3 hours in advance even for domestic flights. I arrived 1hr 45 mins in advance and was put onto a later flight- no explanation, I can guess because the flight was overbooked. I asked to speak to a supervisor to discuss the change and they refused to send me one. The response was 'it doesn't matter you have a flight' - I suggest it does matter, this has now affected my onward journey. After getting my boarding card, I had to join a two hour long check in queue. I have flown from many airports across the world, this by far is the most chaotic,stressful and experience. The staff are unhelpful and verging on rude. If I had the option I would never fly LATAM again.

### "enjoyed nothing about this flight"
One good thing about this experience, the cost of it. Ticket from Sao Paulo to London was cheap. You really get what you pay for. Enjoyed nothing about this flight, uncomfortable seats, average service, terrible food. Flight arrived on time at least. The merger of LATAM has done nothing to improve TAM, I had hoped LAN would make improvements, I am yet to see them. Avoid this airline where possible.

### "Check in was chaotic"
Buenos Aires to Salta. Check in at the airport for the outbound flight was chaotic. When I asked the Latam agent what the problem was she replied "What do you expect, its vacation season". All of this hour and forty minute wait, despite having checked in online the day before. No bag drop available. The flight was then delayed almost four hours. To Latam's credit, we were given a voucher for a sandwich and soft drink. Once on board, wasn't expecting smiles but was expecting apologies from the captain and crew for the delayed flight - never happened. Food for sale on board. Purchased a hot tea which was tepid and not worth the price. The return flight six days later was on time.

### "Shout out to staff of LATAM"
Santiago-Chile to New York. First they allow me to change the date of my 92 years old mother's flight due to an accident, for a very small fee. Then my mother had a problem with her visa, so she couldn't travel the second date, They put her on a waiting list for a third time. The day of the flight she was assisted to her seat, but it was the wrong seat, so my mother was removed to her right seat which it was already taken. The staff then was extremely nice and acomodated her on business. Shout out to the staff of LATAM.

### "great plane, woeful service"
Great plane, woeful service from Sydney to Rio de Janeiro via Auckland and Santiago. The only good thing about my LATAM experience was the plane on the Auckland-Santiago route. Great plane, clean, modern, great technology and comfortable. The booking process was painful with multiple problems on the which continued when I tried to book a vegetarian meal (Painful and lenghthy experience) and check in online (website malfunctioning). The first leg Sydney - Auckland was with Jetstar who LATAM seemed to have not informed them that I had connecting flights and the counter staff had no idea how to deal with this, and the gave me a boarding pass for the Santiago leg and said to go to the transit, which I did and then found out that my baggage was lost in the airport. Jetstar staff all gone and LATAM staff had no idea or ability to contact Jetstar, but this was eventually sorted out. The food on the flight was pretty horrible, cold soggy uninteresting meals. Staff were nice though. when I got to Santiago it was on time but the chaos and confusion in the airport the LATAM desk overrun with angry peopel shouting, people jumping the queue staff confused and people missing connecting flights etc - it was awful. Eventually after two hours of that mess I got my boarding pass then the next plane was delayed by over two hours with no LATAM staff available or interested to help. The gate staff were overwhelemed with crowds of angry and frustrated people in overcrowded gates with so much chaos, in a filthy airport that just was not coping with the volume. I gave up trying to ask any staff what was going on and to find things the onle info I got was from shop keepers. The worst customer service ever.

### "I had to cancel my trip"
5 months of waiting and I do not get my money back from Latam. My wife and I bought our tickets in August 2016 to fly March 2017. Being Peruvian she paid less. Being a tourist I had to pay a complete fare but my ticket was refundable. I had to cancel my trip. I telephoned Latam a month in advance and they assured me there was no problem and asked me to wait 4 weeks to get the refund. Nothing happened. So I called back in April and they said the ticket had already been refunded to my credit card. I checked and this was not true. Called again and they told me it was an error. They were going to investigate and gave me a new "case" number. Another month and no news. Finally they changed again my "case" number and promised to solve the problem. I have already received 4 case numbers and spent 5 months calling, writing. Nothing at all except for: "we understand and will get to you as soon as possible". What can a tourist do?

### "only given in Portuguese"
Sao Paulo to Bogota on the first leg of this flight, at least I tried. Pilot needed to cancel the take off twice due to "technical problems" with the aircraft. Aircraft set on the tarmac for over three hours to be repaired, just to return to the gate again after having undertaken a second take off attempt. The problem was apparently not solved. Eventually the flight was cancelled completely and passengers were requested to disembark. No information from the ground staff and what is going on, and even worse, all the information that were given were only given in Portuguese language. Please note that this was an international flight from an international airport. Not acceptable. All in all this was a horrible trip with an unprofessional and incapable airline that has cost me almost a full day of my vacation. Two out of ten for LATAM organizing a decent hotel and snacks and drinks without further hassle and for the decent in-flight entertainment that helped passing the time (if it was operational, on some seats it froze and thus seized operation).

### "my niece was denied her trip"
Santiago to Montevideo. LATAM's customer service agents are either very poorly trained, have been assigned no real decision-making authority, or both. The result is that the simplest, most reasonable and most straightforward request, if it happens not to appear in their manual, is denied. Yes, with a polite apology, and even with recognition of how very unfair it is to deny the request. But denied it is. My own experience involved making a typo on my Smartphone on their online reservation system. Booking a flight for my niece, I clicked on the wrong date. I couldn't fix it online even though I caught it within five minutes, so I phoned. First level of customer service: "That's too complicated for us". Escalated to second level of customer service: "I'm not authorized to change that". Escalated to third level of customer service: "What you request is very reasonable, but I will need to forward the case to my supervisor". The Supervisor then didn't get back to us until after the (incorrect) flight had taken place. I was out $300 and my niece was denied her trip. If you must use LATAM, book your flight via a travel agency, so that you don't ever have to deal with their customer service personnel.

### "choice of food and drinks"
Santiago de Chile to Concepcion. I thought the onboard service was going to be expensive, but no. The prices are the same as you can found everywhere, and you have a large choice of food and drinks, hot or cold. In some flights they can't heat it because the flight time is too short, but this flight lasted 45 minutes and they were hot. The interior of the plane is well preserved, despite its age

### "very poor quality of food"
Lima to Santiago de Chile. Very good inflight attention by excellent cabin crew but service let down by very poor quality of food (a snack), and also by indifferent ground attention at Lima airport. For a place with such a big operation it is extraordinary they do not provide a lounge for premium passengers. I was in transit and no one told me of this change so I went to the lounge I used them last time I flew with them, only to be told to go miles away to gate 21 to get a voucher, but on arrival there was told to go back from where I started and take lift downstairs to collect it. No effort was made to make things easy for a passenger or to remedy the inconvenience they caused by not telling me anurjign, someone who paid a lot to travelling business with them. Tue girl who handed me the voucher for 20 US dollars rude and defensive when I told her no one had told me there was no lounge.

### "experience clouded by dreadful food"
Flew LATAM from Bogotá to São Paulo - Guarulhos. Incredibly friendly and efficient cabin crew but overall experience clouded by dreadful food (the beef was really hard), really awful sparkling wine and the lack of small things like a toothbrush for an overnight flight, which was close to 6 hours. Credit goes to their 3 choices for the main course and some of the best cabin crew I have come across.

### "Poor customer service and misinformation"
We travelled home to NZ as a family of 4 with LATAM Airlines. My daughter is gluten and dairy intolerant and requested a meal to suit by phone prior to our departure. She had 5 attempts to get her request to be understood and finally was told there would be no meal service for our short haul flight from Sydney to Auckland, despite it being listed as part of our ticket price. The flight counter on departure said there would be a meal and special needs catered for so we didn't purchase goods at the airport. In flight - meal for everyone- surprise! But nothing for her. Hence she got to watch everyone around her eat while she only had the memory of breakfast 6 hours earlier to comfort her. Poor customer service and misinformation.

### "the flight was perfect"
For a flight from Madrid to Frankfurt, I cannot imagine that service on LH or IB even comes close to what LATAM offers. This 787 aircraft arrives in Madrid from Santiago, Chile and continues on to Frankfurt. This is a true international business class product with full lie-flat seats and catalog of AVOD. The crew was outgoing and personable, the meal-snack was delicious, and the Chilean sparkling wine was delicious. My only caveat to a perfect flight was that LATAM does not fund the use of passport and security fast track on this route. That would not be a problem if they informed business class passengers of this anomaly at check-in. This would avoid the embarrassment of being turned away. Except for this, the flight was perfect. I invite readers to check out LATAM's fares on this route: you will be amazed.

### "service is excellent"
Flights covered Buenos Aires to New York JFK via Lima. Checking in at LATAM is very easy, no complaints. Onboard service is excellent, crew superior to many other airlines. Food ok but could be better. IFE excellent but unchanged programmes from my last flights in February. My only complaint is that after all the hype over the Dreamliner, I find the economy class seats incredibly narrow, hard, uncomfortable and impossible to sleep. The mood lighting might be great, the air quality better, cabin pressure improved, but someone's forgotten about seat comfort. The B767 and A320 seats were worn, but at least very comfortable.

### "not use this airline again"
Sao Paulo to Iguazu Falls. The flight was ok apart from the tired cabin. I am an aircraft engineer and it was not in good shape. However this was not the problem as I expected this standard. The problem was changing an existing ticket using the helpdesk telephone number. If you ever find you need to change your ticket over the telephone then DON'T. I tried for 12 hours on and off, sat on a supermarket pay phone in Argentina and got nowhere at all. I was told each time that I would be contacted to give me a new price. Every time I called it was the same answer...where would you like to fly, we can not help until you are contacted by the specialist department, you must wait etc. I had a sleepless night in my hostel not knowing if I had a flight and unable to arrange alternative plans until I knew. Over 12 hours to resolve a simple flight booking change? Which did not get resolved at all. Frustration is not the word. I will not use this airline again. I will take a 20 hour bus next time as it will be more relaxing, more comfortable and cheaper.

### "Absolute disaster"
Santiago to Sao Paolo. Absolute disaster. We were delayed in Santiago due to crew not being on time arriving 40 min late. Then in flight we requested to be assisted for notifying SAA of delay and priority disembarkment. At Sao Paolo ground crew took 20 mins to open the plane door. No assistance from there, no notification to anyone in Sao Paulo. We missed our flight to Johannesburg. When requesting a letter from confirmation of delay, not even any offer for accomodation. LATAM staff didn't even bother to find out why the plane was delayed. The worst airline I have ever used by far. LATAM are incompetent and cannot accomodate international travelers. Their staff has no clue of how to treat clients and assist. For example the captain does an anouncement about a delay without even repeating it in English. It was the most selfish crew and if I had to choose will never fly with LATAM again.

### "unsatisfactory and negligent service"
Cusco to Talara via Lima. LATAM is terrible and unhelpful when it comes to service. We were flying from Cusco to Talara via Lima. Our flight from Cusco to Lima was delayed, and thus we arrived at the gate of our 2nd flight during last call. The attendants at the gate was unapologetic, said it was Cusco airport's fault, said no compensation except to book another flight at another airport. Firstly, no apology. Saying sorry and empathizing would calm our nerves. No compensation for this situation nor assistance navigating the airport security where we had to explain to security why we have to reclaim our baggage. This is LATAM airlines fault. They had no sense of urgency or willingness to help. We spoke to the flight attendants on our flight from Cusco to Lima to assist us to request to let the gate know that our flight is leaving right when we were landing and all they said was oh it will be fine talk to the people at the gate it doesn't take long to get to the gate. They didn't even have the courtesy to let the gate know we were coming, knowing we were running desperately to catch this flight. My friends and I ran through the airport, pushed out way past security and made last call but didn't make our connecting flight. I think as passengers, my friends and I we did everything we could do ensure we make our connecting flight but Latam airlines and all the employees we were in contact with did not have the sense of urgency or the commitment to providing the best service possible to ensure we get to our flights; instead we received such substandard, unsatisfactory and negligent service.

### "Worst airline ever flown"
Worst airline ever flown. Cancelled my flight into Santiago sitting in lounge, delayed flight Santiago to Lima. 3 hours later no update. VIP lounge clerks not willing to help. No updates when I'll ever be able to leave. Not unreasonable to obtain update post 3 hour delay. Zero help from LATAM staff. These people have zero idea how to run an airline.

### "LATAM travel experience lacks"
Sao Paulo to Bogota. LATAM travel experience lacks, the quality of food and beverage has dramatically decreased. The staff attitude on board and at check-in is terrible. The plane was not in top condition. The pitch between rows was standard. I would only fly LATAM if it is the cheapest.

### "very basic service"
Miami to Buenos Aires via Santiago with LATAM. Very basic service, food is not good, staff service attitude terrible/arrogant. Pitch between rows is less than average, not very comfortable, expected 787 to be more comfortable. A320 service between SCL and AEP (Buenos Aires) also like a low end low cost.

### "Service was extremely attentive"
Santiago to Buenos Aires. A truly nice experience from beginning to end. LATAM priority boarding area and Lounge made pre-boarding extremely simple, fast and pleasant. Boarding happened smoothly, the 2-2-2 layout of LATAM Premium Business is not ideal as you might (if you are on a window seat as I was) be forced to climb over the passanger next to you to go to the toilet. Still seats very wide and comfortable; the flight was only 2 hours long, but pillows and duvet were distributed for those wanting to take a nap and the seat seemed comfortable enough to get a decent sleep. Service was extremely attentive - even for such a short flight - and included a full breakfast on white tablecloth and china; overall the crew was very nice and friendly, always called by name each of the passangers and walked that extra-mile that makes a flight really enjoyable these days. It was my first flight in LATAM Business product and I am sure that if there is the chance I will use them again, against other carriers (like BA).

### "Good trip overall"
Los Angeles to Santiago. First time flying LATAM and first time on a Boeing 787. Check-in was done in Portland OR through Alaska Airlines with boarding passes and baggage all the way to Santiago. Was able to go on the airside of LAX from Alaska (terminal 6) to Tom Bradley International without going through security again. Boarding was very easy, bus to plane. Seats in economy were 31" pitch- tight for an 11 hour flight. Plane was clean and seat and entertainment systems all worked well. Once we took off, in early afternoon, full meal was served with good Chilean red wine. Flight attendants were helpful, efficient and available. Rest of flight was uneventful and landed on time in Santiago. Baggage arrived timely and without incident. Good trip overall.

### "not as good as it should be"
Flew LATAM Airlines from Miami to Santiago. Service in Miami was pleasant but not as good as it should be. Most spoke Portuguese quite well but English was limited in some of the personnel. LATAM had modified my flights but had failed to correct my entire reservation. Took me over 20 minutes of one on one with personnel to get it straight. I would say they are a bit unorganized in the terminal. It is Miami but still the work provided should be better.

### "standard of service has dropped"
Buenos Aires to Sydney via Santiago. Over the past 9 years my I have flown with Lan airlines more that 16 times around South America and from Australia to South America. This, however was our first trip with them as LATAM. Never again! Lan and Tam as separate companies were always amazing once you got on the flight. The service outside of that, was never that good. However, now it is impossible to deal with them. Also, the standard of the inflight service has dropped dramatically. Both airlines used to be something i would recommend and boast about to friends coming to visit me in South America. I will just list the problems we had with a return flight from Melbourne to Buenos Aires and then a return flight from Buenos Aires to Sao Paulo. The wrong flight departure times given for first leg of the flight (out buy 4 hours), tried to call customer service with wait times of over 45 minutes and then it would just disconnect. Called with a 2 hour wait time and the person on the other end giving the incorrect information. With language skills not proficient in Portuguese or English. Lost Luggage on two flights  The seat we reserved 9 months in advanced was not valid as I have an Australian passport and can not be verified until i arrive for that flight. The check-in managers response was "we have this problem with every flight to Auckland and Sydney. We get so many complaints. The company have no interest in fixing this problem" Flight delayed for over an hour without updating anyone. When I asked if they could just make an announcement so all the people waiting knew what was happening they just looked at me as if I had asked them to fly me on their back to my destination. On a leg of the flight that was over 3 hours the only food was a sandwich labelled "vegi" with cream cheese and some unidentified vegetable (only an assumption that it was a vegetable). When asked for the sandwich we could see other people opposite us eating we were told we are sitting on the other side of the plan so we can't have that one. Took 4 weeks to process the purchase of a ticket with lanpass points, we sent an email saying because they had changed out departure time we could change are return time/date with no additional cost. tried processing online and was directed to call. Tried calling gave up after 1 hour. Went into a Latam office and was told the only way it can be processed is if we call Latam and directed us to the phone. Was then told after waiting only 40 minuets for someone to answer that we could we just need to pay a small fee. However, the person calculated it incorrectly so after 1 hour of talking and clarifying he realised he didn't know what he was doing and we couldn't change our ticket. Positives The wine is good I will NEVER fly with them again. I will use Aerolineas Argentinas before them and that is saying something. I believe now Latan feel like they can dominate the region and no longer have to impress their customers. Its such a shame. I was very much looking forward to this partnership but am so disappointed now. I will never fly with them again or any of the on world partners that may put me on on of the Latam flights.

### "lost a loyal customer"
Cuzco to Lima. I flew LATAM eight times over the month of March 2017 in Brazil, Chile (including Easter Island) and Peru. To my surprise, the price of my ticket from Cuzco to Lima (already higher competed to the local competition) was raised by 177USD because I was not a Peruvian resident. Tourists be aware of this policy that LATAM applies to non Peruvian residents! You will end paying much more than necessary. Tickets with other carriers for the same trip go for 60-70 USD! Before being fined I was overall happy for the services of LATAM, which now has a lost a loyal customer.

### "attendants pleasant and attentive"
Sydney to Buenos Aires AEP via Santiago with LATAM. Booked ages ahead for a very good fare. Chose LATAM over Air New Zealand partly due to being able to fly into AEP instead of EZE. Proved to be a good move as it's heaps closer to the centre of the city. Outbound flight was delayed (my inside knowledge says it was nearly cancelled) but we eventually left about 3 hours late. With time made up enroute and a planned long connection time in SCL we arrived on time. Checkin was easy, flight attendants pleasant and attentive and the IFE was pretty good. Food is mediocre and after a few flight you see that it's a little repetitive. We sat towards the front on the 787 which was quiet. I'd avoid sitting in the centre near the toilets or in the rear - noisy due to toilets flushing or galley. Checkin at AEP was slow. Had tried to checkin online but their system is nonsensical. The checkin agent was fantastic and we ended up in the front row on both flights. Note that the first 4 rows of Y are space+ and have 2 inches more legroom. You usually pay, but this was waived due to our whinge about the online checkin. Flights back right on time. The AKL transit is a bit painfully long at 5am but whatever.

### "a low cost airline in terms of service"
Flew from Medellín to San Andrés. LATAM has become a low cost airline in terms of service, for national flights they don't​ provide any food or drinks, even if you pay full price and the flight is almost two hours long at mid-day. The service has decreased from Aires to LAN, and now is better to take a low cost airline.

### "exceeded our expectations"
We recently flew with Latam for our honeymoon from Melbourne to Argentina on 20 March 2017. We found the service to be excellent, food was delicious and the entertainment was great (all the latest shows and movies). This flight was a code link with Qantas Airlines. When we had a stopover in Chile, we missed our flight to Argentina (LA 445). We met with staff member at the LATAM service desk in Santiago who helped us track our luggage and arranged for us to get on the next flight (via standby on LA443), free of charge and no issues. In the end, we were only delayed by 1 hour. We couldn't have been happier with the result. It was amazing customer service which exceeded our expectations. We will be travelling with LATAM again and recommending.

### great service from LATAM"
A great service from LATAM. All flights full, but easy checkin at the airports, organized boarding, plenty of storage space. The Boeing 787 flights have fantastic IFE systems, best movies, music etc for hours and hours of flying. Great in flight service, food good, drink selection good. Only drawback was seat pitch - cramped. Will continue to fly LATAM when their routes take me to my destinations.

### "service was normal, nothing outstanding"
Madrid tô São Paulo in business class with LATAM Airlines. Flight departure on time. I had already had dinner, so didn't have it on board. Seat was OK, fully 180°. Service was normal, nothing outstanding. Cabin configuration of this new A350-900 is only 2 classes, no first class, no Premium economy. Only 2 toilets in business class for 30 passengers. No wifi. Good onboard entertainment. Nobody asked me if I would like to have breakfast the next morning or not, so almost missed it. Landing also on time. Would fly again only if hey could issue the ticket with points/miles.

### "avoid them at all costs"
We were flying from the Galapagos to Quito and then on to Lima but our flight to Quito was severely delayed. We rushed off the plane and through security to get to the gate right before the plane was to take off (note the plane had not yet left). However one of the rudest people that I have ever met working in customer service just shook her head and said go buy another ticket. Now, it was 8 pm and I was with my 2 small children and had got to the gate before the plane took off but she refused to let us on. When I asked if we could be rebooked on the next flight or the one after or if there was anything that could be done, she simply shrugged and said go buy another ticket. I am not rich by any means and can't spend thousands of dollars on another ticket for 4 people. I told her this and she said nothing. Hands down THE WORST customer service I have ever encountered. The worst part was we later found out that they had cancelled our tickets back to the US which were scheduled for 3 weeks later, effectively stranding my family in Quito, where I sit now. I have been at the airport for 2 days arguing with people to try and at least let us have the flight that we paid for and is scheduled for 3 weeks from now back to the US. Absolutely terrible and I would avoid them at all costs. If I could rate them negatively I would.

### "fly again only if get a good offer"
Sao Paulo to Madrid on LATAM Airlines A350. Check in fast and efficient. Departure was delayed 50 minutes, no explanations This aircraft is part of a new generation of Airbus, the air in the cabin is more humid, less noise. No first class or premium economy, only business and economy classes. Configuration in business is 2x2x2. No expresso coffee Light that indicate if the toilet is occupied did not work. Cabin attendants normal, nothing to mention. Seats in the business class are fully 180 degree flat. Three choices of main course, 2 choices of dessert. Arrival was also 50 minutes late. Would fly again, only if get a good offer.

### "flight of regular quality"
Buenos Aires to Miami. Direct flight of regular quality. Check in nice, friendly Professional and pleasant desk service. . The flight was very quiet even though the plane is old and needs refitting soon. Cabin staff were polite. The seat is old and no longer comfortable. It does not work well and it locks when wanting to do it bed. The waiting for luggage was well-tempered. Hopefully LATAM will soon change these aircraft it uses for the EZE-MIA flight by the B787 incorporating for routes departing from Chile

### "cabin staff were polite"
Bariloche to Buenos Aires with LATAM Airlines. Excellent flight, check-in really quiet. Professional and pleasant desk service. We left and arrived on schedule, the flight was very quiet, cabin staff were polite, friendly and professional. The waiting for luggage was quick. Night flight and highly recommended. All was very well.

### "lack of communication on the ground"
Buenos Aires to Lima with LATAM. Flight delayed by 3 hours on arrival at airport, this then extended to 5hrs which meant we arrived in Lima at 3:30 in the morning instead of 10:30pm. The aircraft is okay - business class has a fairly comfortable but quite narrow flat bed. Staff was friendly enough but we didn't really want any food or drink at this point anymore. What lets the airline down is the total lack of communication on the ground.

### "overall, very good experience"
Montevideo to Mexico via Santiago with LATAM Airlines. Both flights were on time. The LATAM lounge in Santiago is really good: good snacks and wine selection. Plus, I used one of the showers and it was very neat, clean and comfortable. The seat on business class was good too. Full recline to a flat bed, with probably the best duvet I've had on a plane. Movie selection was just ok. I had the quick dinner option (so I could sleep more), and it was good. Overall, very good experience.

### "experienced terrible customer service"
Buenos Aires to Puerto Natales via Santiago. My family and me had a very bad experience with LATAM. We couldn't check-in online, and we had to do it by calling them (it took 30 minutes). Then, our flight from Buenos Aires was delayed, and we missed our connecting flight at Santiago. When we arrived at the airport, no one from the airline was there to help us expedite customs and immigration, so we missed the connecting flight. To make things worse, it was a struggle to have LATAM finally re-book us to a flight to a nearby city, where they transported us by car to our final destination. We spent 3 hours arguing with them at a check-in counter. The next day, we received an email that our return flights had been canceled, because we had not used the original connection. We had to call them again: 1.30 hours later, they finally agreed to un-cancel our return, admitting that it was their problem that the original connecting flight had been missed. The day before our return, we tried to check-in online. Of course, it didn't work. We had to call them again: they couldn't find the reservation (although they had made it themselves). Add one more hour, until they finally checked us in. On the way back, our departure was delayed because there was a maintenance problem with the plane. They didn't offer any explanations, people on the bus started complaining (they had actually driven us up to the plane and left us waiting there). The flight back to Buenos Aires finally departed and arrived 2 hours late. My advice: if you have any choice, avoid this company. We experienced terrible customer service and delayed flights, and thanks to them we missed an entire holiday day waiting at an airport.

### "uncomfortable start to a very long journey"
Lima to Santiago with LATAM. Could not recline our seats, making sleeping (on an overnight flight) impossible. We have 20hr layover in Santiago 0430hrs - 0005hrs before flying to Sydney on no sleep. Staff had filled our overhead storage with their own personal bags. Inflight entertainment on your own device with no charging method provided. Very uncomfortable start to a very long (40hr) journey, Do not recommend.

### "we have not got our luggage"
Our luggage was lost on the way from New York JFK to Guayaquil. In spite of many emails and calls and 3 visits to the LATAM Airlines office on Dec 23rd and Jan 1st at Guayaquil we have not got our luggage. There seems to be no communication whatsoever between the offices of this airline. WE left Guayaquil to Galapagos on December 25 and requested that the 2 suitcases be sent to our hotel - The Wyndham in GYE as we were returning there after our Boat trip to the islands. The hotel desk called in Spanish while we were incommunicado on the boat, LATAM Airlines emailed us on the 27th December to say they had sent the cases to Baltra - against all common sense and asked what hotel we are at. Most tourists go on boats not hotels! Since then we have heard nothing from them! All our equpment needed for our trip has limited our opportunities on the trip and our losses are enormous.

### "the stewards were not visible"
Rio de Janeiro to Frankfurt via Sao Paulo. At the check in the lady mentioned we couldn't sit together for an more than 11hr flight (the longest leg of our flight). After insisting and asking the manager (sharing the trouble we had on our flight going to Latin America with Latam), the lady could find a solution. When boarding the flight from Sao Paulo to Frankfurt, we where 45 min in the plane before the captain shared that they where waiting for the cargo to be loaded. Afterwards he made clear that the door was damaged and therefore we had to wait in total about 2hrs 45mins. During that time the stewards were not visible, and after about 40 minutes the stewards offered a glass of water for the passengers in Economy class. When arriving in Frankfurt (2hr delay) our luggage was lost.

### "irresponsible, indifferent and careless"
San Andrés Island to Bogotá. After arriving at the gate I was told to wait. I peeped to see what was going on and the crew was on their laptop playing some game. They were visibly embarrassed that some of us noticed them so they put on a charm offensive which did not last long. More than half an hour after take off and well after the seat belt signs were out they still had not open the front toilet. I was in 1A and was hoping to use it but could not ask them to open it because they had by now congregated in the back galley. Eventually they said I had to use the rear toilet because they needed to do a 'security procedure' (which was to feed the pilot and co-pilot). After this they still did not open the toilet and then congregated In the front galley chatting away very loudly with the curtain drawn as if we passengers were irrelevant to them. They seat belts signs then went on for the rest of the flight. They looked delighted because they just sat and chantted away and did not have to hand out food or drinks to us. Never seem crew so irresponsible, indifferent and careless.

### "Very enjoyable flight"
Santiago to Easter Island. Very enjoyable flight with modern aircraft (Boeing 787), delicious food and very friendly cabin staff. The IFE is fantastic with a good selection of movies and entire box sets of latest TV shows. The seat felt a bit narrow though. It was fine for this four-hour flight, but I’m not sure I would choose it for a 12+ hour flight. Check-in at Santiago Airport was a bit confusing. Although this is a domestic flight, check in is not handled by the domestic check-in counters. After being redirected twice, I finally had to check in at a counter labelled “Sao Paulo”.

### "they are a despicable business"
Arequipa to Cusco. I purchased two tickets from LATAM Airlines website for $138. Then when I arrived at the airport their agent said there is a penalty fee of $354 ($177 each). I asked why and they said since I'm not Peruvian I have to pay the penalty. First off, why even let me purchase tickets online, charge my card, and send me my confirmation and itinerary if you are going to charge me double at the airport? Then I asked for a refund on my tickets which was denied. So you're going to up charge me with sneaky hidden fees and then deny a refund for my original ticket when I can't afford the up charge. This can't be legal. Now they had me trapped. I couldn't afford the $354 up charge and told the agent that. She said she could drop the penalty to $154. Still trapped with no option I said, "sure, what other choice do I have?". Either lose $136 and have no flight or pay the extra charge. After the aweful flight I opened a customer service claim online to attempt to get a refund for then extra money they charged and I got terrible customer service and was stonewalled as they closed the case without ever letting me respond. They fully took advantage of me and are a despicable business. Avoid LATAM.

### "recommend flying LATAM"
Sydney to Santiago via Auckland, first time travelling business class long haul and LATAM made sure it was great. With the exception of the size of the lavatory and the ground crew in Auckland during transit, I could not nitpick anything. I was pleasantly surprised how great the seats were for length. The lavatory lacked space and was just as cramped as any economy toilet and one member of ground staff decided to get on the phone about one thing while I was boarding holding me up. The manager did come over and tell her to hurry up as it's delaying boarding, but it was frustrating having to wait for what sounded a pointless call. But besides those two things. Very good service and would recommend flying LATAM to anyone.

### "pleasant flight aboard LATAM "
Flew from Santiago to Florianopolis on LATAM's A320-200. Check-in was quite sluggish, as there were only two or three counters open with about five planes checking in at the same time. Ground staff was friendly though, so I wasn't particularly bothered with the check-in process. You could tell right of the bat that the plane was quite old, as each armrest was equipped with an ashtray. Despite this, the aircraft was fairly clean and well kept. The seats were also quite comfortable, with great legroom and a generous amount of recline. Despite the airplane not having personal entertainment screens, I downloaded the LATAM Entertainment app on my phone, which allowed me to watch movies, TV shows, and look at a flight map. On the flight, we were served a sandwich, a croissant, fruit, and a choice of drink for breakfast. I was surprised to see real cutlery for each meal tray, which is something I rarely see. The crew aboard this flight was friendly as well, and responded do the flight attendant bell quickly. Overall, this was a pleasant flight aboard LATAM Airlines.

### "disappointed with this experience"
ES: Mi enamorada compró un pasaje para mi desde Lima to Arequipa. Al momento de hacer la reserva el precio era el mismo para ambos. Antes de que fuera direccionada a la página ella tuvo que poner los números de los documentos de identidad de ambos. Con otras aerolíneas al saber que el pasajero es un extranjero el precio final sube automáticamente (si esa es la política de la empresa para con extranjeros). El aviso de sobrecarga para extranjeros no es suficientemente visible y debería ser cargada automáticamente en la parte del pago. Una pareja a nuestro lado también tuvo el mismo problema y no se siente bien tener que pagar US$ 177 extra en el aeropuerto cuando estás convencido de que lo que pagaste ya comprendía todo el servicio. Parece que es un problema bastante común y debe ser solucionado porque estoy totalmente decepcionado con esta experiencia con LATAM. Desde un principio la página no debería debería permitir que extranjeros compren un pasaje a un precio que no les corresponde. EN: My lover bought a ticket for me from Lima to Arequipa. At the time of booking the price was the same for both. Before she was directed to the page she had to put the numbers of the identity documents of both. With other airlines knowing that the passenger is a foreigner the final price goes up automatically (if that is the company's policy towards foreigners). The overhead warning for foreigners is not visible enough and should be automatically charged on the part of the payment. A couple next to us also had the same problem and it does not feel right to have to pay $177 extra at the airport when you are convinced that what you paid already covers the whole service. It seems to be a fairly common problem and must be solved because I am totally disappointed with this experience with LATAM. From the beginning the page should not allow foreigners to buy a ticket at a price that does not correspond to them.

### "worst flying experience I've had"
Punta Arenas to Santiago. Worst flying experience I've had, and it was on my honeymoon, sadly enough. Our flight was to leave at 4 am. We boarded the plane and waited in our seats for over an hour - no communication as to why there was a delay on take off. After an hour and a half of waiting we were told the flight had been cancelled because the plane was having engine troubles. They told us they didn't know when it would be rescheduled for, so we just had to wait. Then, 4 hours later, we found out the flight was rescheduled (to 12 hours after it was supposed to take off.) I talked to multiple people who said LATAM wouldn't let them switch to one of the earlier flights going to the same destination, even though there were seats available, so they missed their connections. When checking in for the rescheduled flight- there was 1 employee working doing check-in and bag drop, while 50 people waited in line. (and “conveniently" the electronic check-in wasn't working that day either.) At one point, nobody was at the front desk for over 20 minutes, while the line continued to get longer. We were given "vouchers" since the flight was cancelled, which equalled 7,000 pesos or about $10 USD only to be used on a sandwich or NA beverage, and of course they were out of sandwiches and could only be used at the cafes outside of the gate area, so everyone had to go through security again just to get their "free" coffee. Wouldn't have been a big deal if it wasn't the cherry on top of a very long day. It was the slowest, most unorganized airport I have ever seen. I was told to expect an email with information about a $50 reimbursement. It's been almost a week and haven't received that email yet. Furthermore, $50 is not even close to enough considering we lost an entire day of our honeymoon because of this flight. Fortunately these things happen rarely. But when they do, it is the airport's responsibility to their customers to make it right and reimburse for the wasted time and inconvenience it has caused.

### "service nowadays is poor"
Frankfurt to São Paulo. LATAM Airlines used to be a reference when it was Tam Airlines, unfortunetely the service nowadays is poor. The boarding process at Frankfurt Airport was confusion, they tried to create lines per rows at the gate, but they failed. The flight took off on time, then they started the service, there was two options of dishes for dining (pasta and meat) and only one option for breakfast (Sandwich). Drinks options were very limited. There wasn't amenities kit, nether welcome drinks when we came on board. During the flight after service they didn't offer more drinks, nothing more. Such a long flight with LATAM Airlines was an unpleasant experience.

### "never recommend this airline"
Recife to London via Sao Paulo. I have travelled to Brazil many times before but this is the first time I chose LATAM. I thought the connection would be easier by using the LATAM. However this was a mistake. First of all, I have only 1:45 minutes connection time, and the plane was late about 30 minutes. I was told by the crew not to worry. Arriving in São Paulo, it took us almost half hour to leave the plan and get the bus. I understand problems may happen. However the lack of information or assistance from the crew, not even to confirm the gate number or whether I had to change terminal, was unacceptable. I was told by the arrogant senior steward that the ground staff would help. Arriving at the terminal there was nobody from the airline to help with international connection, as suggested; the available staff did not speak English and was only guiding domestic connecting passengers. To make it worse the airport was poorly signed. The only people who really helped me were the duty free ladies. I had to run to terminal 3 and just made the flight. I tried to complained at the gate to the supervisor but she did not speak any English and did not bother apologising. On board, feeling tired and distressed I asked for a cup of water and was served by a very arrogant and unhelpful stewardess. Luckily, I had some very strong sleeping pills, which I took and only woke up in London when the whole LATAM nightmare was finally over. I would never recommend this airline to anyone.

### "Absolutely appalling "
On a 3hour 30 minute LATAM flight from Ushuaia to Buenos Aires, departing at 1pm (1 hour late) you'd expect something reasonable to eat for lunch. Wrong. We were handed a small cardboard box containing a very small packet of savory biscuits, a sweet biscuit and a chocolate biscuit. Plus a choice of coffe, tea, juice or water. Absolutely appalling and no nutrition.

### "staff not well trained"
Sao Paulo to Belem. LATAM at Sao Paulo Guarulhos is now offering self-tag machines. I shall not say "offering". They compel everyone to use them, and staff has not been well trained. You are strongly instructed to do. No smile, no explanations. Therefore you should expect shorter lines for dropping. Lines are huge, because they already closed many check-in stations. It took me more than 45mn to drop a single luggage. They also decided that Rimowa and Louis Vuitton bags should be dropped in a special place as they are "very expensive items in case of damage". The whole process was crazy. A321 is a high density aircraft now, with small pitch. I paid R$30,00 for emergency exit, with a lot of space. I should not be allowed to do so, as I am older than 60 and they refuse 60 years old people on emergency exits. As far as I paid, they did not check my age. Food was a courtesy very tiny sandwich, with no other option for a >3hours flight.

### "very inattentive attendants"
Sao Paulo to Lima with LATAM. In this relatively short trip of 5 hours the only good thing about business class is the lie flat seat, although it is in a 2-2-2 configuration and very old. Apart from that, everything else was really poor as seems to be the case with LATAM business class lately. They only served a ridiculous breakfast, with very inattentive attendants that simply disappeared after 1h 30min of the flight. Horrible food, poor service, small IFE. Truly below par. Only choose it if you favor the seat, otherwise you will be better off saving your money.

### "like an economy-class trip"
Lima to Sao Paulo. This flight is operated with a plane from original LAN and not TAM. Despite that, the same problems on the incoming flight were repeated. The service was poorer with a economy-class style breakfast served and absolutely nothing else during the flight. Attendants are not courteous and seem to be serving you as a favor. Apart from the lie-flat (narrow and dated), the flight just looks like an economy-class trip.

### "definitely fly LATAM again"
We flew from BWI to Juliaca, with the flights split between OneWorld partners LATAM and American Airlines. The comparison was not a good one for American. The LATAM planes were so much cleaner, more comfortable, and up to date. The LATAM seats were better, with more legroom. and seat back entertainment systems. The staff was pleasant and helpful. Even the bathrooms were cleaner! One thing we really appreciated was that LATAM gave priority check-in and boarding to senior citizens, along with people with small children and disabled folks. I don't know how often we will fly to South America, but I would definitely fly LATAM again.

### "the service has skydived"
First time flying LATAM after the merger was completed, well I can tell the service has skydived, crew are now too impersonal and can look shabby at times, on board service is very basic for the price paid, well they have changed a lot and it seems they are preparing to enter a low cost type of service, soon food will be purchased on board according to one of the cabin staff. Well in Brazil sadly we don't have much options. On the positive note, the planes are new and clean and they leave on time more than ever now.

### "staff attitude could not have been friendlier"
Whilst I was courting BA on this route something magical happened to cabin crew of TAM Brazil. This was my second trip with Latam this year and the staff attitude could not have been friendlier and more helpful. No more standing back and letting passengers fight for locker space or argue about mistaken seat numbers. Crew welcomed and assisted passengers and remined courteous and friendly during what is still limited contacts with passengers. The old habit of early boarding and a fast pace meal service remains along with the crew exodous to the beverage bar for most of the flight. The B777 which doesnt seem to have been on this route so long is now getting tired. Dinner was a decent offering in both directions and although there is not a designated Bar service as such I managed a couple of glasses of half decent red. The small goodie bag of socks pen and toothbrush are no more and not a snack to be seen during the 11 hour flight. Film selections not too up to date but I selected two each way. All in all, boarded, flew and got off rather like an extended coach trip. Not too bad an option in the light of pretty ordinary airlines on the London - Latin America route.

### "lounge in Sao Paulo is exceptional"
London Heathrow to Sao Paulo with LATAM. It was my second return trip this year on this route. Both journeys were consistent, and in a good way. Their boarding starts about an hour before departure for all classes, which speeds up departure times. The business class cabin does have a seven-abreast configuration (2-3-2) and I certainly wouldn’t want to be a passenger in the middle of the three in the centre. Luckily, I had a window seat (1A outbound and 2K inbound). The seat is comfortable, the food courses are served all at once on one tray (which is a let-down for business class) and the cabin crew is very efficient. The seat isn’t fully flat, but despite being 6ft 5ins in height, I was able to get about 6 hours of sleep in both directions. The Salvatore Ferragamo amenity kit given out provides everything so get through the flight, and the toilets are kept very clean (for walking around in slipper socks). The LATAM lounge in Sao Paulo is exceptional for food, drink, showers, space and comfort, and better than many other airlines. LATAM could do with a flat-bed seat in business class, but they are really leading the way in lounges and this airline should be watched with interest as they consolidate into one brand.

### "seats are very comfortable and spacious"
Check-in: Outbound the domestic and international terminals merge together (at least for LATAM/LAN). There was no business desk we could find so we joined the long (and heavily laden) queue at the dedicated Isla de Pascua desks. Around counter 46. Arrive at least two hours before the flight for peace of mind. Inbound Easter Island airport is tiny, and after checking in there's the option to head to the airport bar or to the less busy Piroto restobar outside the airport and just down the road (opposite the car park). Terminal: There is no lounge access for Premium Business travellers (despite hints on the website) as this is a domestic flight (and no lounge at Easter Island). Product: The Dreamliner is excellent and the business class seats are very comfortable and spacious, with a great entertainment system (we later travelled on the same plane in economy for two hours and thought that experience was also fine). Despite having the app I could not connect to the entertainment via this on any LATAM flight. Food: On the way out we got breakfast after take off and a snack before landing. On the way back we got a main meal after take off. The food was good as were the wines (though slightly less premium than their international flights). Service: On both legs the crew were superb and very attentive, if a little more formal than you would find on BA/Qantas. They expertely crawled and retrieved an iPhone that had slipped behind the flat bed seat (happens on every flight). Baggage: At Easter Island it was a massive scrum with priority bags out at the same time as the rest, on the return it was far more civilised with priority bags first.

### "seat pitch is one of the worst I have seen"
Flew LATAM Airlines from Sao Paulo to Rio de Janiero. The queue on check in was very long and it took an hour to check in. One of the most reliable airlines in Brazil, I was impressed with the hospitality and cleanliness on board. However the seat pitch is one of the worst I have seen and is extremely tight. Drinks are served on longer flights of 3 hours (taken previously to Recife) along with a non-vegetarian snack with no options to select anything vegetarian. On the short run to Rio, a box with water, biscuits and a chocolate was handed out. The most alarming issue is that while flight attendants speak English, all announcements on board are made in Brazilian Portuguese which made me worried - what language will these airlines make announcements in during emergencies? Therefore, I will prefer to fly local airlines that make announcements in English as well.

### "the preferred seats meant nothing"
On my first visit to Santiago and BA I choose LATAM. The flight to leave Sydney was delayed. Don't bother with preferred seating when you choose your ticket online, they don't respect it and offer pathetic excuses while the system doesn't work. The food is average. Don't expect the nice treats Qantas give you in between this service is basic. The stewards are not full in English but some basic hand gestures will get you through. The internal South American flights are basic. Coffee and muffin between Santiagio and BA. This flight circled around BA for an additional hour before landing. The home flight was a drama. When the flight was leaving Santiago they were offering to put people on other flights due to capacity. Once agian the preferred seats meant nothing. No choice of meals, they ran out of variety. On arrival in Auckland we were advised the flight would be delayed 6 hours due to operational matters. People were given a voucher of 15 bucks for refreshments. At the airport people were wandering around aimlessly as communication was poor to the Latam staff member. They redeemed themselves with a seat change at the final leg. The inflight entertainment is average unless you want to watch the 'Friends' boxed set. There is a LATAM app you can use in devices for internal flights. You won't be told of this before hand. Most correspondence is in Spainish anyway. LATAM - very disappointing.

### "ended up being pleasantly surprised"
I didn't know what to expect from LATAM, but ended up being pleasantly surprised. The flight from Heathrow to Sao Paulo was on a plane that was either newer than that on the return leg or had been refurbished, it was also emptier, so had more space for stretching out. Regardless, the multilingual staff were friendly and efficient, the in-flight entertainment better than I was expecting, and the economy class seats comfortable enough to allow me to sleep on what's an 11-hour overnight flight (in both directions). On the basis of this experience, I'd consider flying LATAM again to South America.

### "space between the seats is very limited"
If you ever wanted to know how many people you can fit into an Airbus 320 then fly with LATAM. Flew Rio de Janeiro to Santiago for a duration of 4 hours and 35 minutes and almost needed knee surgery when I landed. The space between the seats is very limited and of course the passenger in front of me decided to recline his seat straight after take -off. Which meant little or no room for my legs. Even worse was when my neighbour needed to go to the restroom and could not get past his reclined seat after I had stood up. I asked a crew member if they could ask the passenger to raise his seat a little and was met with a smile and a no. Other than being cooped up for the duration we were served breakfast and a regular run of tea and coffee and juice. many locals in Rio told me they avoid this airline due to service or lack of it and the seating. I am certainly will look at alternatives after a rather ordinary experience.

### "mobile entertainment worked perfectly"
First time flying the newly formed LATAM. On this flight from Brasilia to Manaus the plane is actually from TAM. This old A320 had an all-economy layout with quite a comfy seat. Well cushioned. Although leg room was down to a minimum. What that means is that when the person in front of you reclines their seat you have to recline as well, otherwise the seat in front of you is pretty much in your face. The meal service was simple but good. By far the best part of this flight though was the onboard mobile entertainment system that you accessed through your mobile device. Worked perfectly. Great selection of movies, TV shows, music etc. Totally impressed for this short-haul plane doesn’t require an IFE system anymore.

### "expect transfer of miles to Iberia"
Guayaquil to Cusco via Lima. I flew LATAM Airlines which is a OneWorld partner of Iberia. As I am a frequent flyer of Iberia, I asked LATAM to convert the miles of this flight to Iberia Avios. I did everything right during reservation and check-in and always informed about my Iberia Plus membership card number. This number was also printed on the tickets and boarding passes. I expect the transfer of miles from LATAM to Iberia to be done automatically as it happens for any airline, but in this case it did not. Since 2 months I lose my time because I have to contact Iberia, send them proof that I flew with LATAM, Iberia tells me I have to contact LATAM and LATAM tells me that I have to contact Iberia. Each time I write an email to Iberia it takes 3 weeks for them to reply to me.

### "nothing to commend it"
London to Sao Paulo. Boarded aircraft an hour before flying which seemed a bit unnecessary. Full flight. Very cramped and uncomfortable seats. Awful outdated IFE. Food ok. Served by unfriendly but efficient air steward, who came across like he really didn't want to be working there. Landed on time moreorless. Nothing great about this airline. I chose it as I could use Avios points to get a huge discount. Other than that, nothing to commend it.
