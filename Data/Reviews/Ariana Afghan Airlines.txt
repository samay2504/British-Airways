### "very friendly and helpful staff"
I flew Ariana Afghan Airlines from Kabul to Delhi. Timing was good, but very crowded while boarding. The flight was enjoyable but no entertainment. Good and enough food provided. Very friendly and helpful staff on the flight. The ticket was very reasonable price.
