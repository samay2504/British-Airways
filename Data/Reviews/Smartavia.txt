### "In short, horrible!"
Not Verified |   To be used only when other possibilities are not offered. No service, low-end staff, aircraft in average condition, ground staff not speaking English. Since the sanctions aircraft in poor condition, very frequent breakdowns and delays. Spartan comfort. In short, horrible!

### "No leg room and super hard seats"
They use a scam payment system for cabin luggage: if it doesn't fit into the tiny box (half of the normal size) you pay 25$ at check-in, but at another mandatory check during boarding it's already 40$. Impossible to check in online unless paying for the seat. No leg room and super hard seats.

### "Avoid flying, unless really necessary"
Impossible to do online check-in, unless you pay for the seat selection. Ridiculous carry-on limits, what happened to IATA guidelines? Seats have no legroom at all. And can't say the cost was low for a low-cost airline. Avoid flying, unless really necessary.

### "no service, but cheap ticket"
First flight was okay, 10kg carry-on, no questions. Small seats, no service, but cheap ticket. Flight back was a disaster, I wasn’t allowed to take the same bag back! Bag should fit in a tiny rack, where even laptop doesn’t fit. At first they tried to scam me into paying €35 for “oversized” carry-on (the ticket cost €42). After one hour of fighting with the staff they found another rule: that laptop can be taken separately. Never again.
