### "Stay well away from this outfit"
Not Verified |  What an experience. I upgraded, they took the money but no upgrade was available. That was September and they have yet to provide a refund, in fact customer support do not reply, yet I email daily. I paid for Business Class but there was none, it did not exist yet they advertise it did. I printed out the tickets as confirmation but their ground staff would not accept them whilst trying to check in at Barcelona. I had to telephone the Cyprus office just to be able to board, we made it with minutes to spare even with being in the airport two hours before. Of course they did not put my luggage on board so my whole holiday was ruined as I did not have clothes or essentials. I had to go back to the airport 3 times to check on my bag, which never turned up in Cyprus. Rude staff, uncaring, its your problem attitude. Stay well away from this outfit, I continue to try to get the money back they scammed from me. Ignorance is their modus operandi, they do not communicate.

### “wonderful staff”
Not Verified | I am beyond happy with the assistance I received from this airline and staff. I had back pain and an injury before my flight, and walking at the airport was very difficult for me. They immediately provided me with a wheelchair and a wonderful staff member who took care of me all the way until I boarded the plane. The ground staff, the crew, and the entire experience were absolutely perfect. I can’t believe how kind, helpful, and professional everyone was — I feel truly blessed. Thank you so much!

### “excellent service!”
Not Verified | I had a great experience flying with Cyprus Airways. The flight was smooth and comfortable, making the journey enjoyable. I was impressed with the ground check-in team, who were kind and supportive. Thank you for the excellent service!

### “a pleasure to travel with"
Not Verified | It’s a pleasure to travel with Cyprus airways. They are so kind and really try to help. The staff in Dubai is super friendly and playful with my daughter. I’m a nervous flyer and I always feel at ease when travelling with Cyprus airways.

### "flight was comfortable"
I would like to express my gratitude to the airport staff for caring about my comfort and positive impressions of the company. I would like to express special gratitude to the employee Annette for helping me resolve the issue with my luggage. The flight was comfortable and in a safe atmosphere for me.

### "super kind and efficient"
Not Verified |  We had a challenge with checking due to a third party error. Even so, Sarah was super kind and efficient. She made us feel at ease and resolved the issues we had promptly. Thanks again!

### "been beyond disappointing"
My experience with Cyprus Airways has been beyond disappointing. I requested a refund over three months ago and have been met with silence and empty promises ever since. Despite numerous calls to their call center (which no one answers) and multiple emails, I have received no satisfactory response. When I finally found a way to reach out to them last week via their chatbot, I was assured my refund would be processed by Friday. It’s now a week later, and nothing has happened. This is an unacceptable way to treat customers, and I’m left feeling ignored and disrespected. If you’re thinking of booking with Cyprus Airways, be warned—customer service is virtually nonexistent, and you’re left chasing your own money for months with no resolution in sight.

### "money is not yet reimbursed"
They cancelled my flight 3 months ago. I asked for reimbursement. 3 months later my money is not yet reimbursed, although I called 10 times. One month ago they said they flagged the reimbursement with "priority". One week ago, customer service tells me the reimbursement is "done". It´s a lie, the money is not received.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |   Worst experience ever. I do not recommend travelling with Cyprus Airways. Very unprofessional, they do not care about travelers, they re-schedule flight without giving any explanation, they do not respond to emails or phone calls. First, they did not issue my 4 tickets, though my credit card was credited, and they did receive the money. I had to send them 2 emails to request an explanation. I then received this explanation that is a bit awkward: "further to your email kindly note that we found your payment and we issued the tickets". How come this could happen. After couple of days, they rescheduled my inbound and outbound flights from morning ones to night ones (at midnight), which is very inconvenient with 2 infants. I contacted them 3 times by email, and they never responded.

### “Customer service was appalling”
Both my outbound and return flights were changed just a few days before departure. The direct 3-hour outbound flight was canceled and rebooked as a flight with a layover, departing 12 hours earlier than planned. The return flight was changed from a direct 3-hour flight to a 6-hour one with a 50-minute layover in Zurich, where we had to stay on board. Customer service was appalling: email responses took 2 days, online booking management was disabled, and it took 30 minutes to get through on the phone. After over 20 minutes of waiting, the call was dropped 3-4 times. A truly disappointing experience.

### "Unprofessional Service"
Unprofessional Service. Almost 3 months ago I booked two tickets through eSky agency. Suddenly, a week prior to departure the flight was changed (advanced by a week) so I opted for cancellation and rebooking not to miss an attending conference. eSky promised to follow up with the airline for full reimbursement or voucher refund. Yet, every time I contact the agency they blame the airline for delay without any professional feedback from any of both sides. Not recommended, neither eSky nor Cyprus airways!

### "Just disgusting"
Not Verified | Just disgusting. Flight canceled a month after payment. No reason, no compensation. I am now forced to look for how to get through other airlines, when there are no normal tickets. I will have to fly with an 8 hour layover at 5am! I do not advise anyone to purchase tickets from this company if you plan to fly.

### "poor, poor service"
Very poor service, airline canceled my flight, booking agent telling me to contact airline, airline tells me to contact agent. I played this game 3 times back and fore, now I took the decision to get a refund from the agent, and obviously this will take forever. Conclusion: no more Cyprus Airways, poor, poor service.

### "ever fly Cyprus Airlines again"
Contrary to almost all airlines in this Covid-19 situation, who allow rebooking at no fee or a voucher, Cyprus Airways have decided they will give NO voucher or rebooking for next year. Hence you either fly - even if your family includes people at risk (my partner who was traveling with me - or you lose 80% of your (expensive) flight. We weren’t even asking for a reimbursement and we would have accepted to pay a change fee. But Spring/Summer 2021 timetables are not published and they don’t do vouchers (only airport taxes). Even if we lose our full ticket, we will never fly Cyprus Airlines again. All airlines are in difficult situations but it is in these moments that service and « fair rules » make all the difference in the world. Never again with them - even if I pay more or make a stopover. Shame on them.

### "satisfied with this airline"
Larnaca to Athens. A small airline yet efficient. In my case the plane was clean, seating was very comfortable, we had a great welcome from the attendants, though I cannot comment on inflight service since I had none. If you need something you have to pay for it. Flight was smooth, and arrived ahead of schedule with a captain that kept us posted on our flight. On the negative side, their in flight magazine in only English, and not in Greek as well. Probably only for English speaking passengers. I was fully satisfied with this airline.

### "no online check in available"
Not Verified |  Thessaloniki to Larnaca. There was no online check in available for me, and if you come earlier to airport you have to wait first in order for the check in to open, and then second for check in queue.

### "there was no one there"
Larnaca to Athens. I was about to board with a friend of mine in a flight scheduled at 10:40 local time. Due to the traffic we had approximately arrived at the airport at 10:05. We rushed into the check in stand but there was no one there, we were informed that the guy had just left so even if we had taken our tickets we wouldnt be able to board the flight since there was no one there to check our hand luggage. Customer service was not answering, we were panicked and when they finally decided to pick up the phone they informed us that we wont be able to board even if the boarding phase was not actually ongoing. Thus we lost our tickets, had to overpay a ticket for later that day and destroy our vacations for merely 5 mins, just because they wouldn't pick up the phone and rush to leave their posts.T

### "Terrible customer service"
Larnaca to Beirut. It’s worthless. Boarding pass says be to the airport 3 hours ahead but check in doesn’t even open 2 hours ahead. With these basic fare they make you check your carry on and thus you have to wait until check in opens. Terrible customer service. Agents at desks are not helpful and messages from the airline are just general meaningless messages.

### "cannot run a flight on schedule"
My flight from Larnaca to Athens was half an hour late. My return flight was scheduled for Sunday 2/6 flight CY 4311 Athens to Larnaca which is operated as I learned at the airport, by Blue air, leaving at 20.45 arriving at 22.30. No prior advice neither at airport and finally we left at 22.45 , that is with a delay of 1 hour and 25 minutes. Hence we arrived at destination at a very ridiculous time, that is at 00.10 hours. Delays can happen on all airlines but when such delays are a daily feature on this particular flight and Blue Air, then things start getting strange, in that on the flight tracker for this flight, in the last 30 days not once has this flight gone on schedule. Every day a delay of one to two hours! One whole month with not one single punctual flight, whether the aircraft is late to arrive from another flight is really not our concern and if they cannot run a flight on schedule then they are not serious.

### "I really enjoyed it"
Larnaca to Athens. My first flight on this airline, and was impressed with an aircraft with ample leg space, that looked almost new, with an inflight magazine (though only in english language and not Greek) and an interesting in flight purchase catalogue. We arrived at Athens ahead of schedule. I really enjoyed it.

### "online check-in still not available"
Flying by CY260 from Larnaca to Prague on Nov 26. One would think like on-line check in is the business as usual for most companies on the planet and a must for all the airlines operating in EU. Until you fly Cyprus Airways. Despite the fact that already in August Cyprus announced that "The online check-in service is available for all the flights departing from Larnaca, Tel Aviv and St. Petersburg. More destinations will be introduced in the coming months. , the reality is that on-line check in still not available. There are also no self-check in kiosks at the airport in Larnaca, the home base of Cyprus Airways. Rather than that, I was advised by Cyprus Airways staff to get to check in 2.5 hrs before the departure, i.e.in case of my flight at 4:30am! The plane is high density and they charge 3.50 Eur for a simple Nescafe.
