### "I am extremely satisfied"
It was my first time flying Air China and I am extremely satisfied. I was lucky to find a ticket at a very low price. I am tall and often have trouble about legroom, but the seats were comfortable with enough space though I was travelling on economy class. The second trip from Beijing to Copenhagen was obviously more important considering that it was almost 10 hours long. On flight entertainment were satisfactory. The flight attendants were friendly and the cabin temperature and humidity were excellently adjusted.

### "the comfort is a big no"
Not Verified |   Old plane, very uncomfortable! I never had such a small plane with no room for you feet for this long duration of flight (13+hours). Food was okay, but the comfort is a big no! Never flying again with this airline.

### "Worst business class seat"
Not Verified |  Worst business class seat in the business. Plane must have dated to the 80s. Dirty carpet and smelled. Nothing like you see on YouTube. I would avoid this airline at all cost if flying business.

### "the most uncomfortable flights"
This was one of the most uncomfortable flights I have ever been on. I had initially booked with Cathay Pacific (flight CX6122) from Hong Kong to Chengdu, expecting their usual high standards. However, it turned out to be a joint flight operated by Air China (flight 412), and the experience was disappointing. The plane felt old-fashioned (A320-200), with cramped seats, no in-flight entertainment, no Wi-Fi, and little legroom. The cleanliness was lacking, and the quality of the food was disappointing. Adding to the discomfort, some passengers were loud, others were inconsiderate, and the cabin was filled with foul odors. When I asked the crew for help, I was surprised that the flight attendants could not speak English, which made communication difficult. Fortunately, after trying to communicate with two of them, a third flight attendant came. She spoke English and was kind and helpful, and eventually moved my daughter and me to better seats. Upon landing, several passengers ignored basic etiquette, got up prematurely, and acted in a disruptive manner. This flight was more like a crowded public bus than a flying experience. While Cathay Pacific is a reputable airline, the codeshare partnership with Air China could be damaging to its brand. I hope they reconsider these arrangements to maintain their high standards.

### "Very bad service"
Not Verified |  The only advantage of this airline is that it has on-time flying times. Other than that, very disappointing. Jakarta to Shanghai flight with transit in Beijing. Imagine, a transit that was originally 2 hours 45 minutes was rescheduled to 2 hours 15 minutes, even during transit we had to take care of moving our own baggage. Our family ended up going to pieces taking care of everything in a very short time. Other airlines, if baggage transfer during transit is handled by themselves, they will give a warning. Meanwhile this is not listed. We feel like we were cheated. When we returned from Tokyo to Jakarta, we had a 24 hour transit in Beijing. The information we got was that we could get a 24h free entry visa, but apparently we couldn't for unclear reasons. Finally we couldn't check in at the hotel we had booked and my money was forfeited. Because I landed in Beijing at 9 pm. There are no transit hotels at Beijing airport. The staff who were asked did not understand. Once there is a "Paid Lounge" the prices are very unreasonable. The price set is around 3.7 million rupiah for a full day! 2 million rupiah for just 5 hours! And that's the only hotel there is, there are no other hotels. Other airlines provide transit hotels if the transit lasts more than a few hours! Finally, our family was like homeless people waiting 24 hours for our next flight! I will not use this airline again. Very bad service! Keunggulan maskapai ini hanya waktu terbang yang ontime. Lain dari itu sangat mengecewakan. Penerbangan Jakarta to Shanghai dengan transit di Beijing. Bayangkan, transit yang awalnya 2 jam 45 menit di reschedule menjadi 2 jam 15 menit, pada saat transit pun kita harus mengurus perpindahan bagasi sendiri. Kami sekeluarga akhirnya kocar kacir mengurus semuanya dengan waktu yg sangat singkat. Maskapai lain, jika perpindahan bagasi saat transit diurus sendiri, mereka akan memberikan peringatan. Sedangkang ini tidak dicantumkan. Kami merasa seperti tertipu. Pada saat kepulangan kami dari Tokyo ke Jakarta, kami transit 24jam di Beijing. Informasi yg kami dapatkan, kita bisa mendapatkan visa free entry 24h, tapi ternyata tidak bisa dengan alasan yg tidak jelas. Akhirnya kami tidak bisa check in di hotel yang sudah kami booking dan uang saya hangus. Karna saya landing di Beijing pada pukul 9 malam. Di dalam bandara Beijing pun tidak ada hotel transit. Para staff yang di tanya tidak ada yg mengerti. Sekalinya ada "Paid Lounge" harganya sangat2 tidak masuk akal. Harga yang dipasang skeitar 3,7 juta rupiah untuk full day! 2 juta rupiah untuk 5jam saja! Dan itu hanya satu2nya hotel yg ada, tidak ada hotel lain. Maskapai lain memberikan hotel transit jika transit lebih dari sekian jam! Akhirnya kami sekeluarga seperti gelandangan menunggu 24 jam penerbangan kami selanjutnya! Saya tidak akan menggunakan maskapai ini lagi. Pelayanan sangat busuk sekali!

### "flight was very comfortable"
First time travelled with Air China long haul. Being British with links to Hong Kong, we’ve mostly travelled with British Airways and Cathay Pacific in the past. With our holiday planning to Japan we had come across the attractive airfare offered by Air China in comparison with other well known international airlines. At first we were worried about the quality of flight experience and even fellow travellers on the planes. After reading on line reviews and watching You Tube clips. The thing that helped us make our decision wasn’t the price alone but the fact we could make a visa free 3 day stay over in Shanghai on our transit back to London. Basically two holidays in one trip. In my personal experience with Air China, we travelled on A350-900 aircraft to Shanghai. The flight was very comfortable, legroom was more than other airlines we travelled with on Economy. My daughter suffered from severe travel sickness and could not eat so they put a special sticker to show that. The flight attendants were very caring and attentive towards her. The toilets were well maintained compared to other airlines towards the end of the flight would be really dirty. Food was nothing special but not awful , good enough to keep you from being starved. Transit from Shanghai Pudong to Japan Narita was 3 hours but did not feel too long whereas in reality the whole trip (2 legs) were quite tiring indeed. We checked in on line with no problems however one of the legs did require us to collect our boarding passes from the airport rather than getting QR code to use from our mobile phones. Pudong to Narita was on a smaller aircraft and older but nothing to complain about as the in flight service was just as good. On our way returning to London, we encountered a little from at Narita . Although we had paid and reserved our chosen seats the system did not show that and two of us had been moved to less desirable seats further back. We explained the situation at the checkin counter and the ground staff sorted it efficiently offering us seats that were even better than the ones we originally chose. We had a seamless stay over in Shanghai for 3 days, luggage were collected at Pudong without any problems. The return flight from Pudong to London Gatwick was just as great. I hope people who have read negative stuff about Air China can give them a go to experience how good they really are. Do not get put off by some bad reviews they may have read on line.

### "food was wonderful"
Not Verified | The flight was great! However, it could still improve. Bring your own tablets as the IFE systems were kind of laggy and the choices were very limited. The seats were quite hard and on my 2nd flight, the seat recline was broken, so I had to manually force it back to the original position. The food was wonderful and so were the staff.

### “flight attendants were kind”
Not Verified | Pros——- The flight attendants were kind and helped us with the wifi for 15 minutes. Very helpful, =mindful and demure. The food was great, I was not expecting that. Legroom was wonderful. Me being 1.83m, there was easily lots of legroom. Theseat was hard, IFE sucked and dirty floors.

### "experience was appalling"
Today at Kansai Airport, my experience with Air China at counter 25 was appalling. The staff member on duty, demonstrated an unacceptable level of rudeness and complete disregard for customer service. They were dismissive, unhelpful, and unprofessional, causing significant delays and making an already stressful travel situation even worse. I expect much better from an international airline, especially at a major hub like Kansai. Passengers deserve respect, efficiency, and professionalism, none of which were provided by Air China today.

### "the toilets were filthy"
Not Verified |  I flew from Beijing to Geneva for over ten hours last week. Everything was ok, reasonable except for the toilets, which were filthy. Passengers used them all the time, and I don't think the flight attendants were cleaning them properly. I only used them once, and after that the whole flight I had to hold in the urge to pee, which was really bad.

### "I will never fly with them again"
Both international planes were probably the dirtiest I have ever seen. To give you examples, the bathroom shelves were covered in dust and old hairs. The main ceiling looked like it had mould on it. The padding on the chairs (which did not look too old) was so thin that I could feel the plastic backing (much worse than Ryanair etc). The food was terrible - the cooked part was like something from a very cheap microwave meal. The server said they had run out of wine (this is an international flight!) and then when he opened the drawer, I saw a bottle unopened. I have flown many times in many countries in Asia but I’ve never heard a safety announcement spend time explaining how you could be arrested for various unknown crimes. International Air China flights have security agents walking around carrying cameras. I will never fly with them again and suggest nobody does.

### "competence and excellent service"
Outstanding Customer Service from Air China Jakarta Airport Ground Staff. On October 2nd, I arrived from Sydney to Jakarta (Qantas), planning to board (within 3.5 hours) on Air China (CA978) to Beijing (then to Madrid and Sao Paulo). Due to Qantas airplane problems, the Qantas flight arrived 2 hours late, leaving me with only 1:40 hours to board Air China. Unfortunately, Qantas refused to give any assistance to facilitate the very short time for check in. Talking to the Indonesia immigration agent, he called Air China ground staff, who sent an agent with a mission to help me(I did not have a Visa on Arrival, no boarding card and a checked luggage at Qantas.) The agent did everything to make me board the Air China flight, talked many times to the immigration officers, called Air China office to send a letter to the immigration and ran 6 times to the Air China counter to try to solve all bureaucratic issues. The agent and other Air China agents issued all documentation needed and ran with me and my luggage through Jakarta terminal be able to catch the flight. Boarding the Air China flight CA978 (in such a short time) was a small “miracle” that was possible because of the competence and excellent service of Jakarta’s Air China ground staff.

### "value for money was 100%"
Flight Booking and Customer Support: Everything was fine and we booked the tickets easily and hassle-free. The flight was only re-scheduled by 15 mins on our way there and 40 mins for our return flight from Athens to Beijing, which it was made up on the air and our flight landed even earlier than scheduled. The price was exceptional with the second cheapest ticket after that being nearly 60% more expensive. Online Check-In: My flight included two adults and one child, we flew from Melbourne to Athens via Beijing. The online check-in process was really bad, both times I did not manage to check in online because during the process, after reaching a point, then the buttons were not working, I have tried multiple from different computers and browsers and I did not manage to complete it, something must be wrong with the website. Be aware. Transit Layover: Air China has a Transit Hotel or Transit Lounge service. Unfortunately, again the website/app (I have tried both) was not very user-friendly and the information asked for the account creation was confusing and part of it was available only for Chinese residents. After a lot of struggle, again, the booking process reached a point where it was asking for the passport number but it did not accept it. I finally gave up and I booked a hotel nearby. Flight: The flight was much better than what we were expecting after reading all the bad reviews. I think for some of them, people had a bad experience with a long delay or they have been too picky because the ratings are not very fair. Back to the flight review. The seats' padding was a little bit thinner than what you can find in a similar aircraft of other airlines but not to the point that caused any inconvenience. The meals were a bit smaller but of decent quality, like any other flight meal. The crew members were frequently passing by asking the passengers if they wanted any drinks. The entertainment system was good with movies, some older some newer, games for the children, etc. Not the latest entertainment system or live sports games that you can find in other airlines, but good enough to keep you busy during the flight. The electronic conveniences were good, with proper touch-screen controls, a power outlet to charge your laptop and a USB charging port. Headphones and blankets were provided. Also, there is no wired remote attached to the seat, everything is controlled via the touch screen only. The internet wi-fi was there, but it wasn't. I did not manage to connect to any website at all, it was like there was no internet at all. The crew members were very polite and respectful. Their English were not perfect, but they could understand you 8 out 10 times. If you are not sure, just repeat and they will get it done. Overall, the value for money was 100% worthwhile, with airline ticket prices skyrocketing nowadays, if you are willing to sacrifice a fraction of convenience and you can live without the internet for a few hours, I would certainly recommend flying with Air China.

### “horrible for people flying with allergies”
Not Verified | Air China is horrible for people flying with allergies or dietary requirements. I am celiac and I flew Air China from Rome to Gaungzhou and back (with layovers) and requested a gluten allergy special meal, the meal was not fine as they put a piece of bread in it and to add onto it was an absolute fiasco to get! Online check-in does not offer you the option to book a special meal like many other airlines allow so you are constrained to call the number (which they do not answer) I am flying tomorrow back to Rome (a 15+ hour travel day) and will not be able to eat any food on the flight I will have to pack my own food. I am very disappointed with their online check as it does not work. It is such a horrible experience to fly with them!

### "no assistance for foreign passenger"
It wasn't very good flying by Air China. Their service was horrible, and they were stuck at the airport for 30+ hours. I feel no capacity to complaint when no internet access, no phone to dial hotline and no assistance for foreign passenger. Keeping people in air conditioned cold place without any blanket, and other necessary stuff.

### "service and staff was excellent"
The service and staff was excellent. Welcomed with Hot towel and they laid out my slippers for me by my feet. They showed us how to use the IFE and opened all the stuff wrapped in plastic ready for my use. Food and drink was served timely and mid way they would check on me and offer me snacks. The seats are very comfortable clean and spacious. It is rare i sleep in the plane but i was sleeping well in this plane. The blanket and pillow was like home. experience.

### "very pleasant surprise"
Overall very pleasant surprise. Longhaul sectors (BUD-PEK) new aircraft, enough space, pleasant crew, 2 hot meals, constant service of drinks throughout the flight Shorthaul (3hours) quite old A330, hot meal, great crew. Generally the food is pretty great when from outstation and not good out of China (I ordered special meal, always received it) Also, entertainment options are quite poor - I would be so happy to watch some Chinese/Asian movies but there's no subtitles. Also, some sectors they make you switch off everything and even not use IFE 30 mins before landing. Confusing Had access to lounge on first sector which I didnt use, and free hotel on the way back (over 10 hours layover). You spend lots of time at immigration and getting to the hotel but those 5 hours at the hotel were priceless! Given the amazing price they usually offer I recommend.

### "lower than average experience"
Have flown Air China from Italy to Japan twice (August 2023 and May 2024) with 3 layovers in Beijing and 1 in Hangzhou; a total of 8 individual flights. Overall, I would say it is a lower than average experience and quality that, generally, a traveller can rationalise away due to a good cost advantage, though this is not always the case and other airlines should be considered if not. I would draw a distinction between, 1) the flight itself, and 2) everything else around it like their website and booking system, online check-in and app experiences. The latter driving the overall experience way down due to what I believe is narrow browser compatibility (causing all sorts of problems in activating fields or multiple-selection drop-downs or even just page loading), cumbersome user interface, excessive 'prove you are not a robot' checks (some of which are actually broken and it is impossible to match in the way required, so you cannot proceed) and inexplicable, generic errors that stop you progressing. The check-in process is particularly frustrating and will require multiple attempts with different devices and browsers. The app simply did not work. Flight Experience: I would say average. Good points are that staff are generally helpful and pass frequently in the cabin to check things, also passing frequently with water. The aircraft I have flown on are an A350-9, B787-9 and 777 300-ER, the first 2 being new and the 777 being quite old and well-worn. Negative points are that the food is a little below average - generally chicken of beef with rice or noodles, but we did get a pork option on 1 flight. To my taste, the food is bland and uninspired. All meals come with a little salad/vegetable side, some bread product and a small sweet or fruit. The drinks cart passes about 10-20 minutes before the food, so don't drink everything before your food comes, though I did notice on my last 2 flights that they came with both drinks and food carts in tandem on the dinner service only. Interestingly, I felt the food on our short-hauls from Japan to China (both flights) were better that the long-haul from China to Italy. There are also no snacks offered whatsoever, so bring something with you if you get hungry easily. During the booking process and also later, it is 'possible' to select a non-standard meal like vegetarian or lactose-free. I selected lactose free on all flights, but this was only satisfied on a single leg of 1 journey (so 2 flights). Thankfully, there isn't much cream/milk in Chinese cuisine, so I had no problem. In the cabin, none of our flights had individual air control at the seat, so you are at the mercy of the overall cabin temperature - I found a couple of flights to be very warm and uncomfortable. I found this the worst aspect of the flight. Trim and materials on all aircraft are basic. The IFE on the 350 and 787 were decent, but the 777 is old with small screens that are often very washed-out and have a very poor touch experience - I always reverted to using the physical controller. Content library is 80% Chinese to 20% western and not very large in any case. No real Wifi on board. English can be a bit hit-or-miss and oftentimes the English PA announcements were completely incomprehensible - thankfully, nothing really important is ever said on any flight PA - but speaking face-to-face is better.

### "unprofessional handling"
Not Verified |   My flight was delayed due to bad weather and it was already clear that I will miss my connective flight (the same for many other passengers). I know that the weather is not the airline's fault, but the unprofessional handling is. Although CAN is an international airport, nobody at Air China CAN speaks English. And even after passengers arranged their own translator, they were not willing to talk to us. Instead of organizing a rebooking and give passengers certainty about how the trip will continue, they did nothing and kept us uninformed until we reached the next stop in the middle of the night. It was barely impossible to plan ahead and inform people waiting for us. Writing a complaint is pointless. The customer service only referred to the weather, but did not address the actual reason for my complaint (staff not willing to talk to passengers and help them rebooking). But this was not the only issue on my trip. My flight should have included Wi-Fi, which was a major criterion for my choice. But it was broken and the airline refuses to compensate for it. After a complaint, they only "confirm that it was broken" (yeah, I know that, this is why I contacted them), but "they cannot compensate, thanks for understanding". No, I do not understand that you find it natural to charge the full price although you confirm that part of the service was not provided.

### "won’t replace my damaged bag"
Air China won’t replace my damaged bag as it is old (2016 only used 4 times). Air China should replace the luggage even if it is old. In addition, the stress and hassle you provided to your passenger.

### "Avoid Air China at all costs"
Not Verified |   I recently embarked on a return trip from Beijing to Madrid with Air China, and to say it was a nightmare would be an understatement. My experience with this airline was nothing short of appalling, and I feel compelled to share my grievances to warn fellow travelers. Firstly, let's talk about the lack of Wi-Fi on both legs of the journey. In this day and age, Wi-Fi has become a standard amenity, especially for long-haul flights. However, Air China seems to be living in the stone age, as they offered no Wi-Fi whatsoever. This made my 12-hour flight an excruciating exercise in boredom, as I couldn't even use the internet for work or entertainment. The drink selection was another major letdown. Despite their menu promising a variety of alcoholic beverages, including vodka, none were available. I specifically requested vodka, only to be told they were out of stock. And don't get me started on the wine - it ran out after just two glasses! From then on, it was water and juice for the duration of the flight, with no snacks to tide me over between meals. Speaking of meals, the quality was abysmal, with not a single vegetarian option in sight. To add insult to injury, they ran out of one of the dishes, leaving me with nothing but fish and rice, which I don't even eat. The timing of the drinks and food service was also a joke - by the time my meal arrived, I had already finished my drink! As if all of this wasn't bad enough, the crew seemed completely disinterested in providing even basic levels of service. They were unapproachable and seemed to go out of their way to avoid interacting with passengers. It was clear that customer comfort and satisfaction were not priorities for Air China. Considering the exorbitant cost of the ticket, I expected far better from China's national airline. Instead, I was met with incompetence, indifference, and discomfort throughout the journey. I believe some form of compensation is warranted for the sheer inconvenience and disappointment caused. In conclusion, if you value your time, money, and sanity, steer clear of Air China for long-haul flights. There are plenty of other airlines out there that actually care about their passengers' experience. Don't make the same mistake I did. Avoid Air China at all costs.

### "This is not a business class"
This is not a business class for a 5 hours night flight. Very uncomfortable, you can’t sleep no space for your feet. Never again, if I have to pay let me get the device I deserve. The service on board was okay, but the rest was very upsetting avoid

### “appalling service and attitude"
Not Verified | They are a bit cheaper than the rest, but not worth the appalling service and attitude of Air China. Everything was bad from the seat not secured to the plane properly, rude staff, terrible food, app unworkable, wrecking your luggage, etc. etc. When I returned home I contacted customer services and they are the worst I have ever encountered. Every reply I got was a lie, asked to be contacted by a manager at least a dozen times, ignored. Don't fly with them, in the long run it will be more expensive!

### "I was satisfied with the trip"
Air China rather surprised me and left good impression in overall after my journey. Might be due to reduced expectations before the trip based on their experience as rather budget airline, but I enjoyed the flight. The ticket price was surprisingly low, twice lower than alternative flight to Taiwan. But check-in luggage was included and the airline was very transparent about their fees. The website seams outdated and fails to load sometimes. Online check-in requires patience, as it might take multiple attempts to complete it. Airport check-in is on contrary fast. Due to operational requirements Air China flights in MXP are parked on remote stands, so boarding is done using stairways. The aircraft to Beijing was Airbus A350-900 - airline's most modern aircraft. The seat was comfortable, pleasant material, comfortable headrest, legroom was a bit small (I am 193cm), but would be rather sufficient for most travelers. IFE had a bit limited choices, but collection was rather up to date. There is a big choice of Chinese films and music and few games. After departure meals were served quite fast. The quality was "okay". The food felt as if it was stored frozen (which was the cause for both segments), but portions were decent size. Snacks were available on demand for the entire flight. The next flight was on A330-300, which is mostly used on regional routes (China and close international destinations), so cabin was a bit outdated, didn't feature an IFE and seats were rather hard with smaller legroom than A350. Headrest didn't regulate but for 3 hours flight to Taipei it was fine. As it was a morning flight, they offered breakfast. Every aircraft had a universal 110V power outlet, supporting European, US, Chinese and British plugs. On A350 USB outlet is also available. In general I was satisfied with the trip.

### “appalling experience”
Customer service was awful in flight, at the airport and online. The food was average at best and cheap quality drinks. To make matters worse I was unexpectedly moved from extra legroom seat to one with less space. The entertainment screen and USB charging port didn't work on 3/4 of the flights. I encountered issues with the website after I booked my flight. Lastly, the service in the airport lounge was awful, with poor English communication throughout my experience. Overall appalling experience. I would not recommend this airline due to these numerous disappointments.

### "footrest provided in economy"
Flight on time from Beijing to Frankfurt. Seat range is great even footrest provided in economy. Service quick and had enough to drink. Open bar during night. Two meals in a 10 hours flight. At night they serve a sandwich and yogurt which was pretty dry but okay. For breakfast eggs or Chinese congee with Chinese egg. I liked it. Everything was fine.

### "not care about customer service"
Not Verified |   Just awful! The entire airline seems to not care about customer service. The food was absolutely disgusting. On my outbound flight (CA837) the screen didn't work, and when I asked they were already aware of this. Only really an issue as it was a 13 hour flight, then they left my bag in China for two days Even with functioning entertainment the choices were limited or heavily modified by the Chinese government. I have never been with an airline that does so many unnecessary announcements.

### "it's not a pleasant experience"
Not Verified |   Air China is cheap it got us to China on a budget. The experience from Sydney to Japan (Tokyo) was ok, goodish even. My husband and I were seated together, meals were ok and we had frequent drinks offered. On the way home from China to Sydney my husband and I were seated apart. We booked together. People with children were seated apart which was appalling. Children shouldn't never be separated from parents. On this flight we were fed a sandwich with a muffin and yoghurt at midnight. A sandwich is not appropriate plan food. Sandwich was stale. We were then given a hot meal 5 hours later with no drinks beforehand. I was so confused the other flights we were given better meals and more drinks. We were dehydrated. Went the toilet saw there was self serve drinks and chocolate but no announcement of this service. Very strange. We should have served drinks every 2 hours. If you need to get somewhere cheap this will get you there otherwise it's not a pleasant experience. My review would have been better 3 stars if it wasn't for our last flight and being separated and fed sandwiches. They need more western films on the tv. Do not separate people when they have booked to sit together! Good way to upset people.

### "Overall great experience"
We flew from Frankfurt to Bangkok via Beijing. Legroom is great compared to other carriers. Two warm meals on a 9 hours flights in economy is great. Even had a foot rest. Food was good for economy. Drinks in a bar mid plane over night. Only the seat on the first leg was a little hard. The 3-4-3 configuration on the Bangkok leg had more cushioned seats then the older 3-3-3 config. Overall great experience. Flights on time. And the transfer in Beijing was easy.

### "recommend this airline"
Ground staff in Hongkong was nice and friendly. I arrived at the final call and off we went to Beijing. My neighbour complained that the airplane was old as you could not charge your telephone there. I have the feeling all the domestic Air China planes have a bit of an old fashioned feeling, but I guess it is just the colour of the seats. The food on board was okay, they first asked me which choice I wanted and then told me that one was not available. :-) Of course it was not a problem, I did not really care. Normally I ask the attendant to "surprise me" and just hand me a random meal, but most flight attendants don't like that game. What I did not like is that Air China had rescheduled that flight to arrive one hour later in Frankfurt, so my connection was a bit tight. Unfortunatelly, we spend a lot of time taxiing in Beijing (guess up to 40 minutes) until we finally left. There was no snack after boarding and drink service consisted of a stewardess walking around with a water bottle. I did not sleep that well, as my seat on that B777 was not that comfortable. Then we arrived in Frankfurt and of course I missed my train. My neighbour was worse, they had checked her in for a connecting flight with a connection time of 20 minutes in Frankfurt, which is ridiculous, I wonder why Air China did that. If they reschedule their flight, they should also change connections for passengers. It seemed the cabin crew was watching the passengers, as I woke up and had my eyes open for about 2 minutes I was handed a sandwich. Breakfast was okay, I always opt for Western Breakfast with Air China, as I do not like that "rice with water". In general, not only when handed by Air China. If Air China has competitive prices, I would recommend this airline and use them again.

### “in-flight entertainment was good”
My Air China experience mirrors my last experience with this airline. Check-in in Frankfurt was rude like always and done by Lufthansa staff. Our plane was delayed by 60 minutes, but as I did not have any tight connections, I did not care. The in-flight entertainment was good, they had interesting movies to keep one occupied. The food was good and the staff was professional. As it was an overnight flight and I was pretty tired I did not have a lot of interaction with the crew. Transfer in Beijing was a bit of a hassle, as so many notes (including on Air China website) tell you you have to pick up your luggage in Beijing, go through customs to enter China and then check it in again. Even at the airport in Beijing signs told us to pick up our luggage, though they said in Frankfurt my luggage will be checked through to Changsha. So I waited a bit at the baggage claim and as the delivery was finished without my suitcase, I continued into China. My next flight was okay as well, I remember we did only get a muffin on that domestic flight of 3 hours and there was basically no in-flight entertainment for non-Chinese, but I had something to read, so no problem. Arrival in Changsha was on-time, I guess. I had quite some time to catch my train, so I was not that critical.

### "never recommend this airline"
The only positive part of our experience with Air China was onboard the flight; the flight attendants were amazing. Unfortunately, the service we received on the ground in both Tokyo and Beijing was so awful, that I would never recommend this airline to anyone as a result. We had a pocket Wi-Fi device that needed returning to the company's kiosk in the same departure terminal we were in at Haneda airport Tokyo. Unfortunately, immediately after check-in, we were ushered straight into the line for the departure gate to go through customs and didn't get a chance to return it before going through. We went to the information desk and were informed that this happens often, and that all we need to do is go to our gate and the gate crew can escort us back through customs to return the device, as we had plenty of time before our flight. We thanked them and we went to the gate where there were two Air China staff behind the counter. I went up to the counter and was met with a rude stare from the female staff member who, while typing, said to me "What? What flight? - so I responded, "I am on the Air China flight - I just wondered if you could please help me" and I pulled out the device. She immediately looked back at her computer screen and while typing said abruptly "We cannot help!". I thought, in that moment, that she was looking something up for me as the exchange was so abrupt so I stood there waiting awkwardly for a few moments, but it turned out she was just completely ignoring me and didn't acknowledge me any further. When I realised I was being ignored, I said okay, thanks, which she ignored as well, and I walked away - this took place in front a whole bunch of people in the departure lounge. For some, this may not even be an issue, and I do acknowledge that the mistake of not returning the Wi-Fi device was our own fault of course, but I personally don't care at all for this kind of unnecessarily rude, dismissive customer service. She barely acknowledged me, looked annoyed the moment I stood in front of her, and then legitimately ignored me until I went away. I would have understood completely if our request was declined, but I will never understand that kind of treatment. Following this, when we arrived at Beijing Airport, we had to go through the passport/ticket scanners. After scanning my passport face-down, I tried to scan my ticket face-down as well. It wasn't working, so I was taking a little bit longer than normal, and out of nowhere I hear someone say "face up". I look up, as I'm not sure where that voice even came from as the place was extremely quiet during this process and the airline staff member was standing quite far from me. Because I didn't immediately click that I was the one being spoken to, the staff member got annoyed at me and then shouted from the other end "face up" - this only startled me further so I fumbled trying to do what she said, which only prompted her move closer and shout once again "face up". This whole area was completely quiet, and there were four or five lines of people behind me, so I was genuinely embarrassed. Again, these might not be a big deal to some, but I've never, ever received this kind of "service" from another airline. Wouldn't bother with this airline ever again as a result, and will actively encourage friends and family members not to either.

### "Worst company ever"
Not Verified |  Worst company ever. They couldn't find our booking so we couldn't get our plane. They didn't offer any compensation and didn't apologize. WE have waited for hours to have new tickets for another flight. Don't choose this company!

### "cancelled 7 days before my schedule"
I booked my tickets from Expedia. The airline rescheduled my itinerary with a 32-hour layover in Chengdu. I paid the cancellation fee and rebooked the flight again. Again the connecting flight from Shanghai to Chengdu was cancelled 7 days before my schedule. I had to cancel the booking again and wait for the refund. On the other hand, now I booked another flight with a higher ticket fee which is about double.

### "went very well because it wasn't full"
Returned to travel with Air China, quick boarding at the gate, flight went very well because it wasn't full, rows of seats close together all at my disposal, (the single one is a bit narrow for XL sizes) food was normal, even good compared to other more famous airlines. Decent entertainment, several films in Italian, super crew, they came with water throughout the flight and always available, very poor offer of in-flight snacks, chocolate-covered wafers and little else. Absolute savings but the cost of the ticket makes up for it all. I will gladly return to fly with them for the price, quality and time to get to Japan. Ritornato a viaggiare con Air China, imbarco veloce al gate,volo viaggiato benissimo perchè non era al completo,fila dei sedili vicini tutti a mia disposizione, (il singolo e un po strettino per taglie xl ) cibo nella norma, anche buono se raffrontato a altre compagnie più blasonate.....intrattenimento decente , diversi film in lingua Italiana (Eva ne aveva un paio solo :-( ) equipaggio super , passavano sempre con acqua durante tutto il volo e sempre disponibili , offerta di snack in volo molto povera, wafer ricoperti di cioccolata e poco altro.... ( al risparmio assoluto ma il costo del biglietto ripaga il tutto , me li sono portati da casa gli snack) . ritorno volentieri a volare con loro per il prezzo, la qualità e il tempo per arrivare in Giappone

### 2left with no clothes for two days"
I was left with no clothes for two days in a business trip with Air China from London to Seoul. Air China is a hugely unreliable low class airline that does have the responsibility to get your money and has no responsibility to compensate you for your lost baggage. Online there is no clear automatic process to get compensated for their mistake to lose your baggage. In the three emails that they have online, if you send an email with your request, all of them respond back that we are not responsible for this loss and/or they provide a phone number which is Chinese and you cannot call from the UK. My baggage got a tag in London that will be transferred to Seoul by Air China. The only responsible party for this loss is Air China and no one else.

### "Never flying them again"
Not Verified |  First they cancelled my return flight then asked if I wanted a refund or would be able to fly the next day, which I chose. Unfortunately they forgot to rebook the Shanghai-Tokyo leg the following day. I was able to sort this out on the telephone relatively easily but pretty stressful at the time. In flight service was barebones. Sure they served us food which was bland and didn't taste at all fresh. Warm cans of beer too. Cabin attendants seemed irritated at having to do their job. The inflight entertainment didn't work and there was no interest in finding a fix. There was no information given to us explaining the convoluted transit procedure at Pudong. I was travelling with my daughter at the time yet our return seats weren't together. During the return leg Pudong-Narita, one of my suitcases didn't show up so I had to wait 2 days for it to be delivered. Luggage claim at Narita was a little overrun as 6 other people on the same flight also had missing luggage. Never flying them again.

### "Last time I fly with them"
Be aware, Air China proposes several flight times with different aircrafts. But you will find that they cancel some of them 3-4 weeks before the departure date. And you end up moved onto bad flights with bad timings or aircrafts that you didn't want to book in the first place! On both ways I was supposed to fly with an A350-900 where they advertise free internet wifi (you won't get it on any other aircraft). And I ended up with both flights cancelled. Instead I had to travel to Frankfurt to get a Boeing 747-8 with a very old setup (had to get an extra day off to get this flight). And I got a Boeing 777-300ER on the way back with an even older system and a touch screen which wasn't working (had to use the joystick on the side of the armrest during the whole flight). Then, when you call them, they are simply unhelpful and try to force you to get their solution or simply give up on what you were expecting. Also, I have never seen an airline with such mediocre English speaking staff! When talking to customer support or travelling on a UK to Asia flight, you would expect people to speak a decent English. But that wasn't the case and 9 person out of 10 needed a translation tool to communicate. Crazy! Finally my connection flight in Beijing was just 1h40 after landing. Unfortunately we arrived 1h late (all our 4 Air China flights took off 40min-1h late!). Once at the airport I would have expected ground staff to guide us to reach the other flight/gate as quickly as possible. Instead they gave us a sticker when exiting the plane to show the security/checkpoint people we were late for our flight. But we still had to run and navigate in this massive Beijing airport on our own! After a long sprint and a lot of stress we managed to catch our flight, only to realise they were waiting for another Domestic flight which was even more late! We ended up waiting another 40min inside the plane before taking off. If they told us, we would have avoided us a lot of stress and pain. Last time I fly with them.

### "find the way to fulfill my request"
Unfortunately days before my flight I had some serious health issues and I wasn’t able take the flight to Hong Kong. I contact with the European customer service by email to reschedule my flight but they rejected my request. However two days later my friend from Hong Kong called the Air China customer service Chinese number for reschedule my flight if it’s still possible. The Chinese customer service was amazing helpful and patient they speak great English and finally they find the way to fulfill my request.

### "legroom amazing"
The check-in in Frankfurt was done mostly by Lufthansa staff and they were not really friendly. There was also a Chinese man from Air China who waived me to get to him and then scolded me for not queuing up - he meant the people behind me. The airplane was supposed to be a Boeing 747, but the aircraft got switched. I did not select a seat before, so I was very happy to get a seat in a front row. The seat was okay, legroom amazing. In-flight entertainment was okay, they should have more subtitles available. I was curious about some Chinese movies, but they did not offer any English/German subtitles. Also the User Interface was a bit counter-intuitive. Food was good, drink service excellent. I drink a lot and normally I need to get up and get more water, but we were offered drinks probably every 45 minutes or less. After dinner, they dimmed the light and I could sleep pretty well. From Beijing to Hong Kong I did not use the inflight-entertainment, as I slept or read a book. Flights were on-time.

### "didn’t complete part of my previous journey"
On August 23rd, 2023, I was flying from Amsterdam to Frankfurt on flight LH993, then Frankfurt to Beijing on flight CA932. Then, I was supposed to continue my journey to Shanghai. However, I could not make it to the scheduled flight since I needed to fill in very detail health and arrival forms (which could have already been provided during the flight to save time for people with connecting flight), performed covid test, went through long immigration line, transferred to other terminal, and went through another security lane all within 1 hour 15 minutes after my arrival in Beijing International Airport. I was begging a lot of people in front of me if I could cut lines since my flight was already boarding. Unfortunately, after all those struggles, I still could not make it to my connecting flight to Shanghai. After talking to the security, I was directed to go to the Air China ticket counter. From there, I was told by Air China office lady that I can either get off at Beijing (my luggage is still there at the time) or reschedule my flight to Shanghai. I told the employee: "if I can get out in Beijing then it is okay; I don’t have to go to Shanghai". Never have I ever told that my return ticket would be blocked if I didn’t complete my departure to Shanghai. I was also not told if I needed to re-book my return ticket. I even received an approval stamps from the Air China staff on my boarding pass indicating that I could exit at Beijing. Therefore, I thought everything was fine and I was travelling through other cities with separate trains and airplanes to other cities in between Beijing to Shanghai. The disaster occurred on September 11th, 2023, at 11:35 am when I was supposed to fly back home with Air China from Shanghai all the way to Schiphol Amsterdam Airport with flight CA935 & LH1002. I was not able to check-in and the Air China office lady refused to print out my boarding pass. After quite some time, they came back to me and told me that I was at fault since I didn’t complete part of my previous journey from Beijing to Shanghai 3 weeks prior. Therefore, my return ticket is blocked. The solution from Air China staff was to rebook my ticket as buying new ticket where I had to pay 1300 EURO to get on this flight. So they proposed to me to pay twice the ticket price that I already paid. And it is the price for a one-way ticket, which is insane. I have attempted to address this issue by going in-circles and explaining to the customer service at the ticket office, the supervisor of Air China on duty and the airport manager. However, the responses I received were below standard and I feel that my concerns were not adequately addressed.

### "Food selection was great"
Not Verified | I really liked flying with Air China. They were very professional and service was excellent. Landed ahead of time which was a plus: Food selection was great. The seats were spacious and the flight attendants were courteous

### "Absolutely a nightmare"
Absolutely a nightmare taking the transit at PEK flying Air China, especially if you have purchased any liquid duty free items. The gate information is very confusing and everyine  has to go through security check again in the normal security lines. No liquid more than 100ml is allowed, regardless of your duty free seal. The Airport forwarder refuses sending wine/spirits and both the Airline and Airport staff can not careless of your problem. My colleague and I spent one hour and extra money to pack/ship the duty free goods we purchased, barely make it to the gate which is very far at last minute. CA and PEK no more!

### "exceeded our expectations"
My family of 4 recently took 2 long haul fights with Air China for the first time, from Australia to Europe, and the experience exceeded our expectations. From the modern and comfortable aircraft, all 4 flights on time and pleasant flights, kind, caring, organized and accommodating flight attendants, to food served, we had no complaints. We will be happy to book with Air China again.

### "a good experience, but not premium"
Flown Air China business class FRA-PEK (B777), PEK-SIN (B787), SIN-PVG (A350), SHA-PEK (A350) and PEK-FRA (B747). Check in was fast on all flights. In Singapore there was even an early check in option for all classes. All flights have been in time, 4 out of 5 even reach destination ahead of time. All aircraft have been in good shape and been cleaned properly. At all legs flat bed function in the business class and I had very comfortable flights. The service was overall good, however during two flights after food have been served I did not see flight attendants anymore cruising in the cabin, but once the buttons have been pressed someone appears immediately. Food was ok, better from the China outbounds flight then inbound. Beverage selection compared to other airlines in business class quiet poor. Air China dont have a food menu, the crew will tell you the choice of food upfront and there was a choice between 2 or 3 meals, always one western menu included. Lounges: Frankfurt Lufthansa Business Class Lounge, cold and sterile atmosphere, limited food (mostly snacks), wide selection of alcoholic and none alcoholic beverages. Beijing Air China First and Business Class lounge: Atmosphere was good but little overcrowded and not enough toilets. Food selection was good but quality not so good. Beverages limited choice, Hongqiao VIP Lounge 3, nice atmosphere, limited choice of food and beverages. Altogether a good experience, but not premium.

### "The worst airline I’ve ever flown"
Not Verified |  The worst airline I’ve ever flown with. Their baggage limitations (dimensions and weight) are ridiculously low, so it’s so easy for someone to have to pay more when arriving at the airport. The staff are fine, but they’re not able to control the disruptive atmosphere on the plane. The on-flight entertainment is probably the worst I’ve come across. The choice of movies were poor (outdated, unpopular mostly) and it seemed a lot of screens didn’t work (including my partner’s screen). We strapped into a 9 hour flight with no entertainment. The biggest peeve is the luggage as mentioned before. The weight allowance was far lower than other air lines.

### "cabin looking quite dirty"
A long flight (10h) Cabin luggage allowance is very low, (5kg). The boarding process went well in Milan. The aircraft itself is average. No signs of modernity, cabin looking quite dirty, small pitch in Economy seats. Although it is said to exist, wifi was never available. Very little variety of movies or series to watch. The catering is of basic quality, and the crew is not particularly nice. Flight was in time.

### "worst company I have ever dealt with"
Bought tickets from this company. I received a letter to my mail that my flights were rescheduled for another date. Transfers on these tickets are simply not possible. I've been trying to contact the airline for four days now. I called the phone but the call does not go through, I write to the mail but no one answers. It turns out that I just lose my money. This is the worst company I have ever dealt with. If you want to lose money buy a ticket from this company.

### "price of the ticket is very cheap"
Beijing to Shanghai in October 2020. When getting on the plane, the steward is efficient and fast in guiding passengers. After closing the cabin door, through a very short taxi into the runway ready to take off, without any delay, even in the National Day holiday. But the food is really average, economy class only porridge and pickles, and can't choose anymore. It provides free WiFi, but it can only watch some documentaries and movies, and can't contact the ground. Although the seats of Air China 77W are not very comfortable, the space between the seats is very large and comfortable. PTV is slow to respond, but it contains a lot of films. The landing was very smooth. When we got off the plane, every steward warmly expressed thanks and said goodbye. The price of the ticket is very cheap, only 500 yuan.

### "still have not received my refund"
Not Verified |  Worst airline and horrible refund policy. I was to fly from Beijing Capital to Dubai, but they cancelled the flight. I applied for a refund and it’s been 4 months and I still have not received my refund.

### "loop hole to screw me over"
I requested a refund to my flight because of COVID-19 which was supposed to be a full refund. However what I learned after calling is in order to get refunded for the flight I can not file for a refund online, it had to be a phone call in order to get a refund. Is this confusing? That's because it is, I did an online 'request to refund' and received no refund. So Air China canceled my flight and took my money! How does that make sense at all? I tried calling them several times and their answer was always different, they canceled the flight and I am out of my money for a flight they never flew all because some side loop hole to screw me over. Seems this is common place for this company and I am personally avoid them for all my future flights, while they are cheap you get what you pay for obviously and the last thing I need when I am trying to take a vacation is dealing with this nightmare of a company.

### "the worst unhelpful airline"
I flew to Thailand but with the Corona virus they cancelled the flight from Bangkok to London and wouldn't help to bring people back or give a refund so that we can take alternative flights. They were the worst unhelpful airline. Once they get your money they don't care about the customers.

### "plane brought back memories"
Vancouver to Guangzhou via Beijing. On my Boeing 744 trip, the plane brought back memories. Normally, I like a updated and brightly lit cabin, but the Boeing 744 really brought something special. Their food is questionable and their inflight was entertainment system can have more selections. They also have good value of money as my round trip costed just over $500CAD. Overall, they have great crew and value but can improve on the food and IFE.

### "Refund policy is ridiculous"
Guangzhou to Vancouver via Beijing booked for mid-April. The worst airline I have ever seen. Air China doesnt care their customers and just want to get money from their customers. Refund policy is ridiculous and try to cheat customers. When you call customer service, the only thing they said is there is nothing I can do. Will 100% not to choose this airline ever again

### "an unpleasant experience"
Tianjin to Johannesburg via Shenzhen. Had an unpleasant experience flying with Air China. No service to speak of, the ground staff are content just speaking at you and not listening to what you have to say or are asking. I had to wait for a long time to check in, because my bag was overweight even though I said immediately that I would pay the fee. I ordered the vegan option: I was given a bun smothered in mayonnaise three cucumber slices, some lettuce and an orange wedge. This I did not eat of course. I informed the cabin crew who were polite but unfortunately were unable to help. Could you please enlist the services of a nutritionist and have them review and train your food and beverage department on what constitutes a complete and healthful vegan meal. Do not mislead customers by saying you cater to all dietary requirements when you do not.

### "Utterly shocking service"
Not Verified |  My infant daughter and I flew from Cape Town to Xi'an via Johannesburg and Shenzhen. Firstly I was told our baggage would go all the way to Xi'an (which it did not), but that is the fault of the rude check-in counter rep in Cape Town. My daughter and I arrived in Johannesburg and had to check in our luggage onto our connecting Air China flight to Shenzhen. In Shenzhen I was told to check my luggage in again for the last leg of our journey to Xi'an. However my one suit case and my daughters stroller never arrived, and I later learned that it never left Johannesburg airport. I arrived home having none of my daughters clothes, all her clothes at home were too small for her and to add insult to injury we are now in a 14 day quarantine. We arrived on Tuesday afternoon and were told that on Saturday it would arrive. It is now Saturday evening and still no word on its expected arrival. Utterly shocking service. On a more positive note, cabin crew were friendly and helpful.

### "response to COVID-19 is criminal"
Los Angeles to Kansa via Beijing booked for March 2020. I've had great experiences flying Air China. Attendants are friendly and  food is decent. However their response to the COVID-19 outbreak is criminal. They lied repeatedly about issuing a refund. I had to file a credit card dispute to get my money back.

### "planes are quite old and dirty"
Sydney to Stockholm via Beijing. Really old and rugged airplanes and very little leg room. But the worst part is that the cabin crew makes constant  in-flight announcement. Each time there is a little bump of turbulence there is an announcement in Chinese and English. It is impossible to make use of IFE system and I recommend a good pair of noise cancelling headphones. Cabin crew speaks poor English but are nice and let me change seats to the emergency seats without having to pay extra. (I am 192 cm tall so very worth while.) Lounge staff in Beijing were OK but one woman went out of her way to change our seats in the lounge making sure that we got better seats and even bumped us up to emergency row also on the second leg of our trip. Very appreciated. I have never had any issues flying with Air China but I know that Chinese ground services customer service can be very inadequate and unhelpful so happy I have not had to deal with that. Overall planes are quite old and dirty and food is poor but value for money is great and it got us to our destination back and forth without any mishaps.

### "friendly and helpful"
London to Kathmandu via Chengdu. I enjoyed my flight. The staff were friendly and helpful, the food was good. I think the reason most people give bad reviews is because staff doesn't understand English and sometimes is difficult to communicate with them.

### "not a professional airline"
New York to Beijing. Air China cannot be trusted as a 1st World Airline. I purchased a refundable airline ticket and had issues with my connection to the Air China flight. My entire family was going to the Far East for my daughter's graduation. Our connecting aircraft was cancelled due to a maintenance issue and we missed our flights. When I tried to re-book the next day, I could not reach anyone in their US office. They were closed. Seriously! I had to call their China number to try and get service. I was told that I had to re-purchase the tickets. My ticket was refundable and so I simply cancelled it given I could not re-schedule my family's flights. I am still waiting on that refund. I have sent approximately 15 e-mails to Air China. I did receive one response that advised me that I had to go to their website and formally cancel my flight which I did on the phone with their service agents. I tried that several times but their site didn't work. My advice to anyone traveling to China, do not use Air China. They are not a professional airline and their service is the absolute worst that I have experienced in 30 years of travel. Fly any other airline but do not subject yourself to this company.

### "Worst airline company"
Montreal to Beijing. Worst airline company, this is the only Chinese airline which refused to provide full refund for tickets cancelled before Jan 28. The government set up policies about refunding but this firm is just playing word games.

### "don't know how to manage this"
Montreal to Manila via Beiijing. After the first flight from Montreal to Beijing they let us know just before boarding with 5 hours delayed that i can t get inboard because the govt of Philippines ban all the non Filipino transit in china airport. Staff of the airport didnt know what to do with all the banned travellers and they just sent from one counter to another one. We cant go out of the airport as we don t have visa and we dont have flight ticket to go out of the country. After 5 hours we finally talked with a manager who offer to us a ticket for Thailand to be out of the country ... they provided us a hotel for few hours and we left for Bangkok after they make us sigh a waiver. This was a very bad experience and obviously the peoples on the airport didn t know what to do. I paid business class to go Philippines and finally i reach Thailand without possibility to come back on track To my trip. The people on Air China spoke very low english and don't know how to manage this kind of situation.

### "Not impressed"
Frankfurt to Bangkok via Beijing, returning from Singapore to Frankfurt via Beijingh. The positive was flat bed seat, the lounge in Beijing is ok, tried Chinese wine for first time. The negatives incude constant announcements interrupting sleep/entertainment. The sleeping and entertainment gear (duvet, pillow, sleepers and headphones) was constantly checked and taken off one hour before landing because "people steal them". Some staff were nice others not. I am a vegetarian, and while everyone was getting canape, starter, main, salad, bread, cheese selection and dessert. I was given one dish on most of the trays, no bread no butter. I was hungry in business class on Air China, first time I ever experience that in biz class. There was a lovely vegetarian menu in Business Class but I was not allowed to have it because I asked for vegetarian option during the booking - very puzzling. The entertainment system is 20 years old, the information is inaccurate. Not impressed. From and to Zurich they cannot emit boarding passes, so it was quite stressful to wait at the gate for someone to give us boarding passes specially the inbound. Information is limited and badly translated from Mandarin. Not impressed.

### "will never recommend this airline"
Bangkok to London via Bejing. The website doesn't work properly so you are not allowed to checkin online. Rude staff that doesn't speak English. Plane really uncomfortable and unclean. Don't change flight in China because you will find yourself lost with staff unable to speak English and very rude. Also they laugh on your face when you try to ask questions in English. I will never recommend this airline.

### "my luggage is not there"
Not Verified |  London to Manila via Beijing. I went to Manila via Air China and had a connecting flight to Beijing. Upon arrival in Manila, my luggage is not there. I had to fill up a form indicating that my luggage is missing, etc. The following day I received a reference and after that no one even bother to call me or update me about my missing baggage after that. It’s been 6 days already and still I dont receive anything from them. Even their customer service is not helping saying that they dont have contacts to Beijing or Heathrow and all they can do is wait. If only I can go and find it myself in Heathrow, Beijing or Manila airport, I will find it myself.

### "food was very average"
Recently flew Air China in first-class from Beijing to London. The aircraft is quite new and the seats in first class felt comfortable sitting on. Although the seats are not suite like seats, still once you put up the partition wall up between you and the person next to you, there is privacy. The food was very average but the crew was pleasant. There were 3 pax onboard and 3 crew members were serving. There is nothing exciting to write home about Air China’s first class, but I felt comfortable and relaxed throughout the flight and slept over 5 hours undisrupted.

### "lost me and my family as customers"
Bangkok to Washington via Beijing. Two members of my family arrived in IAD without their checked luggage. The CA rep at IAD provided them with a baggage irregularity report which did not have a complete reference number, which meant that each time trying to follow-up with Air China it was a major hassle having to find the case in their system by using bag tag numbers, etc. Sloppy work on the part of the agent at IAD. We were told that the bags would arrive three days later, despite the fact that there were daily flights with both CA and UA on the PEK-IAD route. The bag finally arrived. I put in a claim for compensation for the purchase of essential clothing and toiletries. I submitted all required documentation and a claim for US$530. I was told to email this information to an Air China agent at LAX. After a week, I had received no response. I called Air China and was told that the agent who told me to email her was on holidays. More ineptness. I was told to email the claim to baggage services at IAD. I did so and received a reply stating that each passenger was entitled to the grand sum of US$43! What does CA think can be purchased in terms of essential clothing and toiletries in the middle of winter in Washington DC for US$43? Shameful on the part of Air China. I wrote the and shared my indignation, particularly as my family members are Star Alliance Gold. They just lost me and my family as customers.

### "really very affordable"
Booked a trip from Singapore to Tokyo via Beijing for my family this December holiday as it is really very affordable, and it turned out great! We got our luggage safe and intact. The flight entertainment was alright - not a lot of new movies but have some that we have not watched so that got us through our flights. The service was alright too. Maybe that is because we can speak and understand mandarin. Food was not good but bearable. Overall, we had a good, value for money experience.

### "has to be the worst airline"
Sydney to Beijing. This has to be the worst airline in the world! After herding us (pensioners) into a huddle at Sydney airport they left us like that for 6 hours and then tell us the plane is technical and go get a hotel and come back tomorrow (after 2 weeks they gave us AUD200 each). when we did they had cancelled us out of all our flights to Portugal and we had to get Flight Center to re-book us, they hadn't even booked us on the new flight. The staff couldn't give a monkeys about its pax and treated us like animals and were so arrogant. The queue even had a fight as people were so tense and the police were called.

### "worst airline of all time"
Sydney to Moscow via Beijing. The worst airline of all time! Website and App are horrible, making online check in not possible. For example, on app, you cannot check in if you do not have a Chinese phone number. When you enter a code of a different country, it defaults back to Chinese. For long flights it is so crucial to be able to select a seat before all the good ones are taken. After 2 hours of trying and multiple customer care calls which brought zero result, I have last row middle seats on both of my flights (24+ hours journey time). Unbelievable! Customer care is useless as well: they cannot do anything about not working online check in and are not even able to tell at what time airport check in closes. This is the very least they should be able to advise. On the flight there is very little leg room (even for me with 165 cm highly), the wine they serve is of very poor quality, the meals are rather small. I will never fly with them again!

### "aren’t any WiFi"
Beijing to Rome. I like Air China, but at this trip I don’t like, because the plane is very old. Air China’s A330 this plane is very old. A lot of Air China’s aircraft there aren’t any WiFi other Chinese airlines have more airplanes have a WIFI, I don’t know why Air China hasn’t got a WIFI on his aircraft and it was a one of the most important airlines in China.

### "Rubbish airline"
Not Verified |  London to Beijing. Rubbish airline, they changed flights 5-6 times and the final change the day before departure. Unable to make change, so they cancel whole booking. They shift the responsibility to the booking agent despite the booking being with them and them making the change.

### "Staff not helpful and friendly"
Not Verified | Montreal to Bangkok via Beijing. Late (1 hour). Food not good. Staff not helpful and not friendly. Not able to get boarding pass electronically so had to wait 90 minutes in line at Bangkok. Had to wait in line another 90 mins to pass through various levels of security in Beijing. Staff yelled with a scary voice to buckle up when there was only a small wind blow and stopped movies at least 20 times per hour for the same reasons (very annoying) in a 13 hours flight.

### "Very poor customer service"
Not Verified |  Auckland to Beijing. Very poor customer service. My husband and I were not seated together for a 13 hour flight. When asked if we could be seated together we were refused. I was also flying with a sprained knee and had asked for an isle seat. I was again refused and placed in a middle seat which made it really difficult to to stand up and get in and out. Staff were unwilling to help and really didn’t care

### "crew were cold and abrupt"
Newark to Mumbai via Beijing. The seats are small. On one flight if you had empty seats next to you , you couldn't move the arm rest to recline. Most of the crew were cold and abrupt. It seemed if I asked for something I was bothering them. You would think the food would be good. It wasn't, no frills. Cheap cold sandwiches, and rice and meat, with seaweed and imitation fish? I was seated next to a male that wanted to flirt it seemed. Since I was very uninterested, he just leaned and leered the whole flight instead. I moved to the 2 empty seats next to me, and a stewardess can over and told me the seats were for the crew, which they didn't use. Halfway through the 13hr flight a couple attempts to use the seats. They saw me alert the flight attendant, and then change their story saying she was sick. She was allowed to stay there, which was rubbish. On my first leg of me trip I had to stand for most of my 13hr flight. The price was good, and you get what you pay for! Next time I will afford better.

### "one of the nicer flights"
Beijing to Phnom Penh return on an A321. The flight pushed back 10 minutes ahead of schedule. This was one of the nicer flights I've experienced on a narrow-body. First a few negatives - This is an old style Business Class seat (2x2) with no seat back monitors - just the overhead drop down TV which was useless, despite headphones supplied. Safety announcements were made by one crew member reading out from her note book (turning the pages swiftly) and the other demonstrating. However, the seat was comfortable with plenty of leg room. The cabin crew were just fantastic. Slippers were opened and handed to each passenger and informed of the flight time and seemed genuinely happy to serve. Hot towels were provided on boarding followed by a welcome fruit cocktail. I was then offered a second drink of Champagne. Drinks menus were handed out but no food menu. It was a choice of Western or Chinese main course and I opted for the Chinese meal. I was then offered a choice of drinks from the bar (a single malt whisky for me), and Chinese White Wine to go with the food. 20 minutes into the flight the bar service began. Dinner was served and the main fish course was very tasty. I was able to taste the wine first before pouring the rest. Again, refills followed. The desert was a strange cake like thing which I was not keen on. Later it was coffee and Cognac, and more refills followed! After the meal, I asked if I could keep the nice red chopsticks. They took the used ones away and returned with an unopened pair plus a souvenir Panda gift. As it was a night flight, the cabin was dimmed, but the crew checked on the passengers if there was anything else we wanted. During the 5 hour flight despite the little recline on the seat, I was able to nod off to about an hour. On the return flight, which also left on time, a Chinese breakfast was served with Dim Sum and Congee - very tasty. Even though the hard product was out of date, the cabin crew were pleasant and engaging.

### Air China customer review
London to Beijing return. Boarding was smooth and on time. I was welcomed and shown to my window seat. These are the old style (2x2x2), with the window seat having no direct aisle access. The small fixed partition between the seats offered a little privacy, but only when full flat. The seat itself was very comfortable and the adjustments were easy to operate. Following a welcome Champagne drink and hot towel, the menus were handed out. The announcements included a clear warning/advise for passenger behaviour on board. The cabin was half full. While taxing, a crew member came to take my dinner order. Although there was a choice of three main courses, I was told they had only one choice for dinner and breakfast left! For dinner,  small appetisers were served, followed by a seafood starter, salad and hot breads. The main fish course was OK but a little bland. However, a desert trolley came along and I was able to choose what I liked, and settled for cheese/crackers and ice cream. Plenty to eat, but not that great. The wine served was good, and topped up several times, before coffee and cognac. One of the crew came to apologise for the lack of choice in the food, but it was not a major issue. What impressed me was the smiling and attentive attitude of the crew. I have read negative reviews about Air China complaining about the lack of English spoken. But for me, that is the charm of communicating with others who may not be so perfect in other languages. I really enjoyed my flight, especially the friendly cabin crew. A large pillow and thick blanket was provided for sleeping. The IFE was not fantastic, with a very limited number of English movies. The L'Occitane amenity kit was also basic. On the 10 hour flight, I managed about 4 hours sleep. On my return flight, the sound quality of the announcements was poor, and I could hardly understand a word spoken. Yet it didn't deter me from enjoying a relaxing time. Considering Air China's low pricing in Business Class, I would fly them again. Lovely cabin crew and comfortable seat, overcame the minor shortcomings.

### "does not have personal IFE"
Hong Kong to Beijing. The ground handling and boarding process wasn't the smoothest - the flight was delayed, and Air China tends to operate out of remote terminal boarding gates which require a shuttle ride or extensive walking times. Everything was fine once we were airborne. The staff were attentive and the seats offered a reasonable amount of legroom, even though they seemed narrower than usual. The Air China A321 does not have personal IFE, they still use the archaic communal IFE systems. Food was average at best. Keep your expectations in line with prices paid, and you should be fine.

### "Terrible experience"
Not Verified |  Rome to Sydney via Beijing. Terrible experience with the unprofessional behaviour with my child who traveled as an unaccompanied minor. After being told our child would be looked after in the Beijing airport we discovered he was made to sit in an office on an office chair for hours on end with no assistance or food. We had booked a lounge and it was not offered. The level of supervision was atrocious. He was let out with an unknown passenger who offered food and water. We will never deal with this airline again. They continue to deny any lack of duty of care towards the child.

### "Lady at counter extremely unhelpful"
Shanghai to Singapore via Beijing with Air China. Ridiculous Airline. 1) Flight delayed. Technical issues. Lady at counter extremely unhelpful. I am risking my connection flight from Beijing. 2) My food options not updated so I will go hungry. 3) No checks for business vs economy class. 4) Made everyone wait for 40 minutes before opening boarding gates. Dont rely on the time they provide on the boarding pass. For 11.55 flight, they opened boarding gates at 10.50! 5. Unhygienic toilets. Not cleaned even after asking. 6) Soap missing from toilet.

### "Stay away from this airline"
Los Angeles to Tokyo via Beijing. First and foremost, the service received was incredibly poor. As our flight date came closer, we began double checking our flight information before we realized our seats were not listed on our tickets. This was an issue as I purposely paid extra to choose seats so we could of course sit together. After hours of being on hold trying to reach customer service via phone, it ended up being a waste of time as the line just disconnects. We decided to deal with it in person as we could never get a hold of a customer service rep. via phone. But low and behold, after arriving to our terminal gate, our seats were mixed up and we were seated separately. The rest of the ride is downhill from here. Need I say more, do not take your chances and be persuaded by the ticket prices and flight times. Stay away from this airline and pay more for more popular airlines.

### "flight departed and arrived on-time"
Air China canceled my flight, which was the only nonstop flight between Beijing and Datong, without any particular reason and re-booked me on the same flight the following day, so I had to cut back my itinerary in Datong. I arrived at Beijing Capital Airport very early in the morning (much earlier than recommended by my Beijing hotel concierge) to find that the terminal check-in area was super crowded. Many customers looked very confused about self-check-in as ones were required to print boarding passes at check-in kiosks, and then to repeat the same process to print luggage tags at the bag drop area. I was able to print my boarding pass but the luggage tag machine could not read my passport, and no staff was found for help. After roughly one hour running around, I finally found a special check-in area tucked away on the other side of the terminal where I could check my luggage and rushed to make my flight. In-flight staff were nice, but there was no IFE. Despite all of the above, I still recommend the airlines as my flight departed and arrived on-time. Also, this was not the first time I use Air China, and my experience was that their pilots consistently executed very smooth take-offs and landings.

### "Food is substandard"
Copenhagen to Tokyo via Beijing. Food from the catering services in Beijing is substandard. Entertainment system quite dated and not working well. Lots of mechanical noise in the cabin. Lastly, the selection of refreshments in the business lounge in Beijing is rather poor.

### "no Premium Economy on this flight"
Beijing to San Francisco. I buy a Premium Economy ticket. On the return flight from Beijing to SFO they print my boarding pass and arriving on board I realize this is coach. I inquire and they say "no Premium Economy on this flight", I presume they changed the equipment. I call Air China to obtain a refund of the price difference. Now they say "You have to call Beijing". They have my flight coupons and itinerary. What else do they need? This is an example in "how to make it difficult for a customer to obtain a legitimate refund" It's a shame as the flight itself was not disastrous. The LA based call center agent finally sorted my case and I received a refund. She called me back several times to keep me informed. I felt this was a good recovery from a rather negatively engaged case.

### "not the worst airline"
Not Verified |  Vienna to Wenzhou via Beijing. The crew was friendly, especially when you can speak Chinese but in general are very polite and helpful. The food was okay, for me it was a little bit boring and tasteless. The entertainment system onboard isn’t the best. The display gets very warm and doesn't react to all my commands. There is no wifi available. Air China certainly isn’t the best but it also not the worst airline.

### "Absolutely atrocious"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Barcelona via Beijing. Absolutely atrocious and an experience never to be repeated. The quality and standard of service prior to travel was non existent. The quality of the plane and standard on in flight service was very poor. On arrival at Barcelona, I was informed that my Baggage was left in Beijing. 3+ days later my bag was delivered broken. Total compensation 18 euros. My expenses for the 3 days were greater than 18 euros, and how they think I can replace the bag for 18 euros is beyond me. Never Again. There are plenty of far superior alternatives. Was it cheap? Yes - but cheap usually means cheap and nasty - which it most definitely was.

### "not the worst airline"
Not Verified | Vienna to Beijing. The service is very friendly and kind, especially when you can speak Chinese, but in general, they are always polite and helpful also in the economy class. The food is OK for me it’s too tasteless and boring, my family said that the food was “edible”. The Entertainment system in front of you is not the best, often it doesn’t react to your touch commands. The movie selection was quite decent there are western and Chinese films. On the Airbus 330-300 there is no Wifi. Honestly, I don’t know if there is wifi in other plane types of this airline but on the airbus 330-300 there is no connectivity. All in all, Air China certainly isn’t the best airline, but it is also not the worst airline.

### "onboard experience lacking"
Sydney to Madrid via Beijing. OK for the price. Their website is very difficult to use, their cabin staff only perfunctory, and the onboard experience lacking. The aircraft were reasonable with seatback screens but the movie choice was very limited and the system slow and hard to navigate, especially with the oddly placed armrest controls. My 777 screen stopped working entirely after 7 hours. The flight attendants did not appear to be happy, warm or welcoming. Their English was passable but their pronunciation poor so cabin announcements are difficult to understand. Beer is available on the drinks round but wine is only available with meals and they like to give you 1/3 of a cup. Asking for a second glass was not received well. The meals were tiny. Taste was good but they sometimes served the same dishes twice per flight. I booked a transit hotel in Beijing both ways, but the process was cumbersome even after I spoke to their call centre. Both ways it took 3 hours to get the transit visa and go through immigration and customs, so be prepared. The Air China service desk is through customs at the door to the terminal. The hotels were quite good but there was nothing nearby either of them. If you have a very cheap fare and do not mind a long break mid trip in PEK then Air China are an option, but other airlines will probably do the job better for not much more money.

### "Service was smooth"
I had serious concerns about this airline before taking my trip, but ended up having a very good experience. So I promised myself I will write a review about it. Best value for money: what caused me to book was the offer of flying a flat bed C-class seat from JFK to Shanghai for $2,200 (return tkt), only with a quick stopover of 90 minutes in PEK. Pre-flight concerns: - I kept receiving automated emails from the airline that my itinerary has changed and that I should contact them and I can change/get a refund for my tkt. The small change that happened once was a 5 minute change in departure time which increased my layover in PEK (good thing, since you need those 90 minute to transfer) - customer service: it's impossible to reach them by phone, the line is not manned. So I emailed them. They responded within 24hrs (or so) and said that my flight's transfer time in PEK is too short and my tkt needs to be changed. But when I went online I saw that my same exact flight itinerary was still being sold on various websites, incl. airchina.us. - The inconsistent response from their customer service really got me worried about the reliability of this airline, so I did some more research online on helpful reviews. I mostly read terrible reviews on how delayed the flights were, people missing their connections and being treated very poorly. That's when I got really worried about having booked this ticket, but figured I will take the risk. Also TPG wrote a fairly good review on them, so that felt comforting. Flight: - Outbound: upper deck of Boeing 747, half empty cabin. Seat was perfectly comfortable (flat bed). Service was smooth, food was good/fine - meat a bit chewy. Staff are friendly and helpful, though be aware they only speak limited english. - Inbound: Boeing 777-300 - full cabin. Seat perfectly comfortable (flat bed). Service was great, they accommodated my specific food requests despite not having ordered in advance. Overall a great flying experience. - All flights were pretty much on time - In-flight entertainment is ok, limited movies selection / limited music selection - no WIFI. Transfers in PEK: - 90 minutes is definitely needed if transferring. You need to take a quick 'airtrain' trip from domestic to intl., even if you don't change Terminals. The connecting flight to and from SHA was a tarmac parked aircraft with bus transfers, so that added time as well. I was traveling with filming equipment and I've never had to spend that much time at security, unpacking my entire bag with all the equipment and letting it run several times through the x-ray.

### "What a nightmare"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to San Francisco via Shanghai. What a nightmare. Staff did not recognize my Star alliance status and told me to que with the rest of the chaotic crowd. Seats are tight and the food is less than mediocre. To make matters worse, you have to go through customs in Shanghai, even though you are transiting. Never again

### "Air China staff didn't helped much"
Beijing to Ho Chi Minh City. This was my maybe 10th flight on different routes with Air China and again a really bad experience. Splitting the 4 people (1 infant, one 2 years old, 2 adults) to 3 different seats across plane can happen. But I would at least expect that ground staff would try to solve it. Attitude of the ground staff was that they do not actually care - in their words "we can do nothing with it". It is OK when the system screws it up but then I expect staff to work towards the customer service, not to let a 2 years old sit alone. In the end we solved it ourselves on the plane thanks to other nice passengers but again Air China staff didn't helped much. Overall service and quality of plane was as well poor. Food is most of the time badly smelling and taste is low quality. Inflight entertainment almost none and even the magazinnes are mainly in Chinese.

### "In flight service efficient"
London to Phnom Penh via Beijing. Not the newest of aircraft but plenty of space (due to old style 3-3-3 seating rather than 3-4-3 favoured by many airlines). Acceptable food (better than BA but not to Emirates or Qatar standard). In flight service efficient and staff on both flight were keen to help and engage with passengers. I was particularly impressed with the Purser and Crew on our second flight who handled the cabin very well and professionally during turbulence and showed  care when dealing with passengers. I would put air China somewhere above the volume US Airlines (who  tend to serve food in boxes), around BA but below the Middle East airlines. For the price point (circa £450 round trip) they are very good.

### "informed we missed the flight"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Bejing. When we arrived in Beijing we had a 8 hour stopover. We toured the Airport and arrived back at our gate about  1 hour before departure. We heard a Chinese Announcement about flight to Manila and repeated by a very bad English. When we approached our gate about 3 mins later than boarding, we were informed we missed the flight. The plane had not left terminal.

### "missed the connecting flight"
Los Angeles to Shanghai via Beijing. The flight arrived late into Beijing and I missed the connecting flight to Los Angeles. They made everyone wait in an area for forty minutes, then put everyone in a bus that got lost twice and took ninety minutes to get to a hotel. No food was provided, my bathroom had no shower door and had a clogged sink. I was the only Caucasian amongst all Chinese. Not a word of English was spoken. When flying from Los Angeles to Shanghai five days earlier the same thing occurred. My flight from Shanghai to Beijing was cancelled due to weather and I was forced to spend the night in Beijing. Rather than accept their accommodation I took the money they offered, forty six dollars and found a four star hotel that cost $250. Air Canada had its passengers stay at the same, pricey but reasonable, hotel. The following day, after spending three hours on the tarmac, without any communication from the pilots, the flight finally departed for Shanghai. Returning from Shanghai I was wiser but no less lucky. My flight from Shanghai to Beijing showed that it would be delayed and I knew I would miss my connecting flight to Los Angeles. An hour prior to the flight leaving I informed the airline staff that I would miss my connecting flight and requested they instead arrange another one. I even showed them flight options on my phone. The answer was no answer. I had to take the flight or be left on my own in Shanghai, not knowing what would happen. I took the flight to Beijing and was then taken to the hotel. I kept asking myself, why can’t Air China run some very simple regression analysis to determine the chances of customers making flights given variables like seasonal weather patterns and historic flight delays. The only answer I could come up with was they either do not think it is important or do not know how to do it. Why do airports in China suffer some of the longest delays in the world? As mentioned in the Economist, “The first reason is that its airports err on the side of extreme safety.” This is consistent with state run ideology. Play it safe. No mistakes, and you won’t get in trouble. According the South China Morning Post, “Like the rest of the world, the biggest cause of delays according to CAAC is the weather, which accounted for 56 percent of flight delays ” No one thinks this excuse is legitimate.

### "Shame on Air China"
Milan to Fukuoka via Beijing. Bad Service. I booked a kosher meal for the flight. The flight attendant didn't checked the special meals, trying to serve me same as others. When I asked for the special meal, she returned to the galley and brought me an open box though it was written on it in big letters that it must be open ONLY BY THE PERSON WHO REQUESTED THE MEAL. DO NOT EAT IF IT WAS OPEN BY SOMEONE ELSE. After I complained, the flight service manager briefly apologized for the "little" mistake, returned to the galley and after a while brought me a small plate with a piece of a fish and salad from the business class. He was in a good mood, laughing, and obviously not comprehending why I refuse to accept the food, saying repeatedly that it was much better than my kosher meal. As a result, I was left without food. How could such a person be a flight attender MANAGER? I have never felt such humiliation and ignorance of passenger needs. Shame on Air China for the service! In addition to being left without food for a 10 hours flight, I got my checked luggage (a hard suitcase) at the destination destroyed by 4 big cracks.

### " Air China is the worse"
I have just used Air China for the first time and had a horrible experience. We traveled to Beijing from Houston late October with tickets bought in May. Our return to Houston was scheduled for October. We arrived at the airport to be told the flight was canceled due to aircraft problems to be told the following day that was a lie. Apparently, for financial reasons Air China canceled both Friday and Sunday flights months ago but didn’t tell everybody. Now changing a very long, costly international flight is already a very poor customer service, but not making absolutely sure everyone realizes such a major change has happened is the worst I have ever seen in an airline. To make matters worse we had to fight to get a hotel and were sent to a very very poor, dirty one. Food was promised to be included but we got there only the buffet consisting of cold chicken nuggets and old eggs were included. Real food had to be paid. When every airline would be trying to make it up, since it was not my fault the flight was changed, getting a nice hotel and food, and an upgrade, Air China simply got us even worse service. I also had to buy my own food since the option was not edible. I travel a lot, have used multiple American and European airlines, being frequent flyer on several. Air China is the worse. Ever.

### "do not recommend anyone to fly it"
Air China is the worst airline ever, their customer service is inexistent, they do not answer calls. On hold for over 2 hours each time and half their Phone numbers for customer service do not work / are paying. Their premium economy is a complete rip-off, you basically get the same seat as economy with one seat next to you empty. I will never fly this airline again and do not recommend anyone to fly it. With this type of customer service.

### "Will not fly with them again"
Not Verified | Houston to Beijing. The flight was good, but not the customer services and the website. The website is confusing even when we typed in the correct/exact ticket # and name it did not recognize our name and we can't do anything online for any change. Also when requesting the mileage to be added to my other Star Alliance frequent flyer # the customer representative behaved very rudely and without any courtesy, made me wonder who actually is the customer here. Will not fly with them again.

### "Terrible service"
Not Verified |  Frankfurt to Shanghai with Air China. Terrible service at check in counter and terrible online check in. They would not let me pick a seat online. They said many people have the same problem. I was at the counter 5 hours before the flight to check in. They gave me the worst seat in the front row and did not ask. Luckily there were better empty seats behind me, so I switched. So stupid that they don’t care enough even about business class customers to offer them a good seat. At least on the plane they were better.

### "experience was horrible"
Islamabad to Melbourne via Beijing. My overall experience was horrible. Air China may be good value for money but be prepared for all the troubles and headaches that you will face with this airline from their uncomfortable seats, not working monitors, stained and smelly seat covers, delayed departure (one day) to loss of baggage. With Air China you are like a guinea pig you don't know where the flight is taking you, you cannot communicate with anyone in China if you don't speak Chinese. Long story short - flight took off to get passengers from Karachi but diverted back being 5mins to land to Islamabad and finally took off again one day late from the city of origin Islamabad, arrived one day late in Beijing (transit) of course the connecting flight was missed because of the airline. Failed to accommodate me or compensate for anything - just gave 350 CNY = $50 AUD to spend 13 hours in Beijing airport. Resting charge minimum starts 180 CNY per hour and 165 CNY to take a shower. My luggage had to stay in Beijing as I couldn't pass through customs, the airline failed to get me my luggage and asked me to claim it lost when I get home while my luggage was one floor away. Spent 13 hours on a bench in Beijing then they arranged for me to take a flight from Hong Kong to Melbourne as there were no flights for the next 3 days from Beijing itself (according to airline) however there were many flights. So all the way to Hong Kong the airport closed while we were in the air - I understand the situation but Air China lands in a city (Shenzhen) where they don't have any staff, any counter, any office or anything related to Air China. So I was again stuck in Shenzhen immigration. Immigration was forcing me to contact the airline, on many attempts by using the officer's phone I failed to get through, the immigration gave up and forced me to buy the earliest flight possible from Shenzhen to get out of the airport. For 12 hours stuck in 3x3 meter spot, no one from Ari China showed up to help or look for the passenger who is their responsibility to arrange accommodation for and arrange the flights for. After 12 hours Shenzhen immigration officers forces me to buy a ticket and claim it back from Air China as we did not hear anything from them. Coming back home after and seeking reimbursement, took 45 days Air China offered TCV Transportation Credit Voucher to spend only with Air China within 12 months. Like are you kidding me, this travel I had was after 3 years and I know for the next 2 years I am not traveling anywhere so their TCV meant nothing but gas and air, after telling them I will not be traveling for the next 12 months they suggest I give the TCV to a friend or family. Like seriously is this some sort of a joke. I was forced to buy another ticket twice more expensive than the entire return trip while I had already paid for one and Air China failed to provide any assistance and service for, they ask me to pass the voucher to family and friend. I earned that money, it is a whole month worth of rent to pay here in Australia and they ask me to pass it to a family or friend. None of my friends or family would ever travel with an irresponsible airline after what I had been through took me 4 days to get home (Melbourne). I do not recommend anyone to fly with Air China. Seriously, pay $100 more and fly with a decent airline that covers their shits and takes responsibility.as
