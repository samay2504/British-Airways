### "Very bad experience"
Worst airlines never on time on top of it extort money from passengers through silly policies. They will charge you for your hand baggage if it exceeds 7kg including laptop. On ground staff are just horrible. Very bad experience and would never fly again with Spicejet .

### “What a difficult airline”
What a difficult airline. The flight was delayed from 15:20 to 16:25. I passed on an Air India ticket at 16:00 so I could arrive home earlier. Then I sat at the same gate while Air India boarded for my destination and watched spicejet delay their flight again to 16:50. What the heck are they doing?! This is the second and last time I use this airline. The previous time was also a delay. Other airlines have been flying without issue, so I suspect it’s a spicejet problem. I recommend avoiding this airline at all costs unlesss you plan on delays.

### “Poor chaotic boarding”
Poor chaotic boarding. No crowd control and boarding was like cattle are being herded. Inside flight no AC till aircraft was 10000 feet above ground and the aircraft inside was humid and sweaty. Poor show. Magazine bags were disorganised and dirty seats. Inflight service was slow and substandard. First time saw trash clearance bag placed over the serving trolley. Worst flight experience of the last 30 years. Hire me to head your flight service for a year and I’ll set the system right.

### "a ridiculous experience"
I was suppose to board on 23FEB at 2 PM Delhi to Varanasi but I checked in morning and flight status shows delayed by 4.30 hours till 6.30 PM evening. I tried to call airline nobody responded why the delay ? I went to Delhi airport and thought at least the flight will take off at 6.30pm but the flight was on the runway waiting for half hour for clearance. The actual take off was at 7.20 PM, this was really a ridiculous experience we faced due to which our next plan totally collapsed. They don't bother about people, just worry about profits.

### "Journey was comfortable"
Pros: Very good interiors and well-maintained seats, cleanliness, lighting. Ample space available between knee and seat in front of you. Well-mannered and clear language (English and Hindi) speaking crew led by Ms Unnati. Didnt have food nor used washroom so cannot comment on that. Journey was comfortable and no bumpy rides encountered. Communication from cockpit was also clear everytime. Cons: Boarding was not done in zone/seat number wise. Quite some mosquitoes seen before take off which bit me and some passengers. Crew applied some spray but wasnt enough. Pricing was a big let-down as huge increase seen while booking on 18-Feb for my journey date of 21-Feb in a short span of time. Slight delay in take-off after closing of doors.

### "Unprofessional behaviour of the staff"
Not Verified |  Unprofessional behaviour of the staff. They have changed my seat twice first given me window seat then aisle, then middle seat, in the last minute saying that you have not paid money for the seat while I have paid more than 14000 to travel Mumbai to Delhi. They need to compensate for such behaviour and inconvenience.

### "charged for 2 kg hand baggage"
Worst airline to fly. Ground check in staff was pathetic. First of all charged for 2 kg hand baggage and charged 100 rs extra. Airplane was old, broken magazine holder, small leg room.

### “abysmal level of service”
Not Verified |  I am writing this review to express my utter disappointment with SpiceJet's abysmal level of service, which has left me frustrated and deeply dissatisfied. Incident Overview: Upon boarding the flight, I discovered that the check-in gates were closed 30 minutes before departure, leaving passengers scrambling to make it on time without clear instructions or assistance from the ground staff. To make matters worse, when I landed at my destination, my baggage did not arrive on the conveyor belt. Follow-Up Nightmare: I followed up multiple times with SpiceJet's management and customer service regarding the missing baggage. I was informed that my baggage would arrive on the next flight to Mumbai at 10 PM on January 6th. However, after waiting beyond 10 PM, the baggage still didn’t arrive. Upon contacting customer service yet again, the response I received was nothing short of shocking: "We don’t really know much about it. Eventually, I was informed that my baggage was declared lost, leaving me stranded without my belongings and without the airline's accountability. Unacceptable Service: This level of negligence is beyond disgraceful for an airline that claims to serve passengers professionally. It is unacceptable that: The baggage was not loaded onto the flight, reflecting the cabin crew's and ground staff's complete failure. The customer service team provided conflicting and unhelpful information, adding to the frustration. No compensation or proper resolution was offered for the lost baggage, leaving me to bear the financial and emotional burden. Call for Action: Stringent action must be taken against the flight management and cabin crew responsible for this mishandling. It is unacceptable for passengers to endure such incompetence and lack of accountability. This experience has severely eroded my trust in SpiceJet, and I will actively discourage others from using this airline unless significant improvements are made. Conclusion: SpiceJet's service was terrible, disgraceful, and indicative of a broader failure in customer care and operational efficiency. I demand an immediate investigation into this matter and appropriate compensation for my ordeal. Passengers deserve much better than this appalling level of service. I shall be taking Strict action against the flight management for this disgraceful experience; I highly urge and request people to avoid travelling on these cheap low-cost airlines with such a pathetic level of customer service , instead, I would recommend either alternative airlines to travel.

### "worst flight experience ever"
Not Verified |  The worst flight service experience ever! We had originally booked a direct evening flight from Ahmedabad to Pune and planned our 2-day hotel stay accordingly. However, the airline cancelled our flight and rescheduled it to an inconvenient 3 AM slot, wasting one entire day of our hotel booking. To make matters worse, instead of offering another direct flight, they gave us a frustrating itinerary with multiple connecting flights, which kept getting delayed at every step: Ahmedabad to Goa, originally scheduled for 5:55 AM, was delayed to 7:05 AM. Goa to Pune, originally scheduled for 1:55 PM, was delayed to 2:55 PM and then further to 4:20 PM. This meant we were stranded at the Goa airport for over 5-6 hours, completely disrupting our plans. They wasted our hotel booking, our time, and caused unnecessary stress and frustration. Hands down, the worst flight experience ever!

### "worst airline ever"
The worst airline ever. I've spent around 6k to buy the ticket and rescheduling my flight as well and they cancelled the flight at the last minute due to bad weather whereas other flights were taking off. And now I've got the refund of just 1600. Had a word with their customer service they have confirmed that they can only provide the refund for 1600 only as I've booked the flight from the third party (MMT). I'm furious to have such horrible experience. In future, if I had the option to choose between spicejet and a bus, I would surely go for the bus.

### "Extremely disappointing experience"
Late flight. Extremely poor customer management. Initially staff was not responding for 1 hr. Later, hopeless response by staff. Extremely disappointing experience.

### "policy seems unfair and exploitative"
Not Verified |  I recently had the misfortune of flying with SpiceJet, and it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had with an airline. The crew was unprofessional, unhelpful, and lacked basic courtesy. Lack of information regarding flight delays, boarding, and other essential updates. No assistance provided for damaged seats or basic amenities. Charged ₹2400 for being 1 minute late for boarding, despite a long queue. This policy seems unfair and exploitative. Seats were damaged and uncomfortable. Long queues and inefficient boarding process. Overall, a poorly managed and chaotic experience. Avoid flying with SpiceJet unless absolutely necessary.

### "flight was delayed by 10 hours"
Not Verified |  I had booked five to and fro tickets to Srinagar from Delhi and back for 27 Aug 24 and 07 Sep 24. I am very disappointed to state that on both occasions the flights were more than 6 hours delayed. The return flight was delayed by 10 hours. There was no apology from the airline or even offer for some water and snacks. In addition, the aircraft interiors were dirty, smelly and on both flights the air-conditioning was not working till we took off. I can assure you that I and my friends and colleagues will never travel by SpiceJet again.

### "only sends automated emails"
Spicejet justifies the tag of being a budget airline! So much so that it does not believe in giving boarding passes online either. A customer could keep doing web check in without receiving the boarding pass or an email confirming the same. The customer service only sends automated emails. Whoever you email to, the response is an immediate auto response email. And the icing on the cake is that, their flights, a day before, get delayed and the reason cited is "operatonal" and one could keep guessing what that possibly means. And this experience is even before a customer has taken the flight!

### "outstanding service I experienced"
Not Verified |  I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere thanks for the outstanding service I experienced on my recent flight from Pune to Delhi. SG-8937. From the moment I boarded, the warmth and friendliness of the air hostesses and crew stood out. They were incredibly attentive, always ensuring that every passenger was comfortable and well taken care of. The professionalism and care they demonstrated, from the safety briefings to the in-flight service, were truly commendable. The team went above and beyond to create a welcoming and pleasant atmosphere, making the journey not just a flight, but a delightful experience.

### "Flight delayed by 5 hours"
Not Verified |  Flight delayed by 5 hours with no communication. The seat allocation is a mess. Changed our 6 seats with 2 kids right at the end in spite of e-boarding passes. On top of it rude staff. Denied wheel chair to senior citizen. I would have given a minus rating if there was an option.

### “Worst ever domestic airline”
Worst ever domestic airline in India currently. Their flights are always delayed for 3-4 hours and their support staff always comes with strange and poor reasons. They don’t care about their passengers. They make them wait for long hours without providing them the actual timings. They don’t even compensate for their delays. They offer a refund if a flight is delayed by 3 hours which is useless anyways because you have to book another flight for you on the spot which costs you double the amount and you are already late. Their support staff is not even bothered to help and guide their passengers. Inside the flight you won’t even get a 250ml water bottle. If you request then only you will be given half of glass water only.

### "Worst ever experience "
Not Verified |  Worst ever experience. Always delayed. Also the ground staff till the cabin crew no one has the basic sense of womens comfort and safety . Even after observing and requested they made me sit between two men. Such bad experience not once, this is always.

### "Never travel with this company"
Never travel with this company. They lost our suitcases on a one-hour flight (they didn't directly put them on the plane) in addition to leaving with a delay of more than 3 hours, one of which they had us sitting on the plane without air conditioning (it was more than 30 degrees ) The suitcases were never sent to our next destination. We had to change plans and go to Delhi to look for them. They promised us they would send them and they didn't, they hung up on us, they didn't answer emails and most of the contact numbers don't work. More than 5 days without clothes, charger, medicine... and today it is impossible for us to claim anything, they tell us that they are not responsible. Several days wasted on calls and half an afternoon at the airport trying to claim and we left without getting anything. Jamás viajes con esta compañía. Nos perdieron las maletas en un vuelo de una hora (directamente no las subieron al avión) además de salir con un retraso de más de 3 horas, una de las cuales nos tuvieron sentados en el avión sin aire acondicionado (estábamos a más de 30 grados) Las maletas jamás nos las mandaron a nuestro siguiente destino. Tuvimos que cambiar planes e ir a Delhi a buscarlas. Nos prometían que las mandaban y no lo hacían, nos colgaban el teléfono, no contestaban a los emails y la mayoría de los números de contacto no funcionan. Más de 5 días sin ropa, cargador, medicinas...y a día de hoy nos es imposible reclamar nada, nos dicen que no se responsabilizan. Varios días perdidos en llamadas y media tarde en el aeropuerto intentando reclamar y nos vamos sin conseguir nada.

### "Worst experience"
Not Verified |  Worst experience with spicejet. They always delayed flights for operational reasons. How the all operational issues are occurring in spicejet airlines only. And if they delay the flights for 5 -5 long hours, have some mercy towards customers, but no, their staffs are constantly laughing on the customers. Every time spicejet flights got delayed. So, now onwards I am decided to never take spicejet flights from anywhere.

### "landed the flight very smoothly"
I was coming back to Delhi on 31st July from SHIRDI on Spicejet flight no. SG 8946 expected to Land at 7.30 PM. Since the weather was extremely bad during the whole flight, there were frequent turbulences. On the Last stretch for around 45 minutes we were asked to put Seatbelts on due to constant Turbulence & all passengers were frightened. But the Pilot & the crew kept very calm & composed and Pilot also sounded very confident assuring us with his regular announcements although being a frequent flyer I knew this was very unusual weather disturbance. Later came to know that many flights were diverted from Delhi that time as there was constant heavy downpour but our Pilot landed the flight very smoothly and with minimum delay.

### “the same with all SpiceJet flights”
Boarding call was announced and all passengers were asked to queue after which boarding was not started for next 45mins. When the buses arrived only 1 number of bus came in the beginning for a fully booked flight causing a further delay. On top of that more than 1 hour of delay. It's the same with all SpiceJet flights.

### "good service by the crew"
I have had good service by the crew. It was amazing, the crew was very enthusiastic and warm welcome. It was one of the best services in my experience.

### "excellent hospitality"
It's very grateful to SpiceJet for the service in flight. Everything is fine with excellent hospitality. Very politely behavior and warmly welcome from your cabin crew and all members.

### "increase delay timing"
I have been waiting from 3 hours and slowly they increase delay timing and I have scheduled my train accordingly but I can't able to reach on time. I have talked from customer service they said spicejet don't provide any service for being delayed, I am at Dubai International airport

### "I would not recommend SpiceJet"
I would not recommend SpiceJet as they frequently reschedule flights. My initial flight was rescheduled for the next day From 6/07/2024 to 7/07/2024. Initial scheduled take off time was 17:35hrs and arrival time in Mumbai was 21:15hrs. They rescheduled 24hrs before. New take off 20:30hrs and new arrival 0:10hrs. At 15:11pm on 5/07/2024 received another reschedule. New take off 21:15hrs and new arrival 00:55hrs. The plane eventually took off at around 21:35hrs. Luggage was received on belt 4 of terminal 1 at Mumbai domestic approximately 45 min after landing.

### "it’s almost 7 hours late"
It’s been 4th time already since my flight has been rescheduled and now it’s almost 7 hours late. Had a meeting to attend but due to their poor third class service I won’t be able to reach there. They don’t even have any alternative flight to provide. What’s the point of booking flight when I’ll reach there after even the train will also reach. Pathetic airline.

### "Third class services"
Not Verified |   Third class services from Spicejet. Never on time it's better they shut down themselves rather than harassing customers. I was suppose to fly tomorrow morning at 9 and received message now that flight is delayed by 5 hrs - what's the point of we booking when we have to be there somewhere at a specific time. You take money immediately for booking but when it comes to refund you'll take 7 days. W

### “Such a pathetic service”
Not Verified | Such a pathetic service they rescheduled the flight 4 times which is really unacceptable at last moment. This was for my mom whose visa was expiring.

### “they ran out of meals”
Incompetent staff to handle delays. Food was to be served to all passengers but they ran out of meals. Strange how they managed the count. Diabetic patient like me and few senior citizens went hungry.

### "not recommend this airline "
The flight got delayed indefinitely and the airline people didn’t even bother to announce the delay and no refreshment was provided to the elders and children leave alone adults. While asked they gave a senseless response and this is because the flight is the only available carrier in that particular route. Though I did not raise this issue immediately and I was a spicemax customer this is silly and unpardonable . I Would not recommend this airline to any of my friends

### "ask you to weigh you handbag"
The absolute worst airline. The Luggage is handled in a way that you might start to pity what you are carrying. Amazingly they will ask you to weigh you handbag and if you happen to carry a laptop along with a few other electronic devices they will say anything to charge you extra. Opt for this airline only if you have no other option.

### "Don't ever book this airline"
Not Verified |   Don't ever book this airline. First they will cancel the flight and then give you a reschedule option. Then at the airport they will say 30mins delay, then again they will not feel ashamed to say tyre burst so slight delay. Then we will be waiting at the gate and they will not even bother to inform. We will ask them why still not boarding. They will say delay by another 6hrs, then they will finally cancel after we are waiting at the airport for almost 20hrs.

### “demanding extra money”
On each airline, cabin bag is allowed up to 7kg apart from laptop bag. But SpiceJet has started weighing at the time of boarding both Laptop and cabin bag together and demanding extra money @Rs 600/kg. If you communicate that you haven’t checked in any bag then they also do not listen. They are also not allowing you to shift the bag to check in baggage by saying that time is over. Happened on Pune to Delhi flight on 2nd Jun and from some passengers they extra charge Rs. 3000. Never book any flight from SpiceJet.

### "the exceptional service"
I am writing to commend the exceptional service I experienced on my recent flight from Dubai to Pune on May 18. I was impressed by the professionalism and friendliness of  cabin crew. In particular, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Anjali and Harshit, whose attentiveness and warm demeanor made a significant difference in my travel experience. I appreciate the seamless check-in process, comfortable seating, and excellent in-flight amenities. I will certainly recommend your airline to friends and family.

### "worst travelling experience"
Spicejet was the worst travelling experience I have ever had. I did prior web check in and made extra payment for a window seat and was allotted one. But when I came for my luggage check in they told me they had no record of me being allotted the seat or my payment. I showed them all the details but they did not buy it. They had no regards for the customer inconvenience as well I was ultimately allotted a middle seat which I was avoiding from the beginning. I will never use spicejet again and I would recommend the same for all.

### "understand that it is a trap"
Horrible experience at Mumbai airport today. I am a frequent flyer tried to board with my normal overnight briefcase and laptop bag. The staff stopped me to check the weight of my bag. It was just 10 kgs and I had not checked in any luggage. The staff refused to let me board without paying Rs. 1,800/- for extra weight. I tried to convince saying I dont have a check in luggage. Please understand that it is a trap. They know very well that we cannot go and check in our luggage even if we want to because boarding has already started and it is less than an hour of departure. This is done intentionally to fleece the regular travellers who do not bother to check in a briefcase. Finally I had to pay 1,800/- or I had to miss the flight.

### "no regards for customer"
One of my worst experiences. Ground staff absolutely disgusting, no regards for customer whatsoever. They want to charge me 1 kg and my laptop bag excess luggage flight delay multiple times. I had connecting trains I had lost money and stayed in hotel overnight. Best you can do just find something else. Ground service I want to zero star

### "Spicejet was bad"
Everyone knows the reputation spicejet has. I chose to ignore it and had booked a round trip with spicejet Hyderabad - Chennai. On my flight to Chennai, I had a terrible experience. The flight was already delayed by an hour. I did not have a checkin bag, and only had cabin. I was asked to pay 1800rs extra for my laptop bag. I've never faced this with any other airline. They waited for the flight checkin to close to start checking the bags. I was forced to pay the full amount, but they gave a discount for the passenger who came after me. The flying experience was not good, a bathroom door that kept making noise in the air - it was loose I guess. It's really surprising that spicejet is still operating. Coming to my return flight (at 8:45am), I was hoping it would be smooth. But again, just at the time of checking in my baggage (7:35am), I get message that the flight has been rescheduled to 12noon. Upon checking with the staff they said the flight was supposed to come from Ahmedabad to Chennai, before going to Hyderabad, but due to technical reasons got sent back mid way. Even the 12noon was just an estimate and it can get delayed further. There was no other airline having a flight earlier than that too. And obviously now with higher prices since it's last minute. But anyways I took this as a punishment for booking Spicejet. Took a full refund (which is pennies compared to the fare of my new booking and the cab from and to the airport again) and booked with a different airline. I chose to ignore the other reviews, I hope you don't. Spicejet was bad, is bad and will be bad.

### "experience with Spicejet are horrible"
Not Verified |   Past few experience with Spicejet are horrible. A we have to suffer for late departures which are being conveyed to passenger at check in counter or even after immigration. Today was cherry on Cake. My Husband is travelling from Pune to Dubai by SG 51 dated 18.4.24.. He was supposed to land at 10.55 pm. On not getting any updates I check on Dubaiaiports.com for arrival, to my surprise it showed: flight diverted to Muscat, Oman. No mail, no msg about status of the flight or the passenger. On calling Muscat airport , got to know that flight has be departed to Pune again.

### !"seats are very uncomfortable"
Airplane was really poor condition. The seats are very uncomfortable. Tight leg space. Got seat near washroom. Cabin crew staff is good - Helpful and Polite.

### "an issue with missing luggage"
I recently flew with SpiceJet on 1st April 2024 from Dubai to Kozhikode and unfortunately encountered an issue with missing luggage. Despite reporting the issue immediately upon arrival, I was disappointed with the lack of action taken by the airline to address the situation. Upon landing, I promptly notified SpiceJet staff about the missing luggage, providing all necessary details. However, I was dismayed by the lack of communication and follow-up from the airline regarding the status of my luggage. As a customer, I understand that unforeseen circumstances can occur, but it's essential for airlines to prioritize customer service and take proactive steps to resolve such issues. Unfortunately, my experience with SpiceJet fell short in this regard. I urge SpiceJet to improve its baggage handling procedures and enhance communication with passengers regarding luggage issues. It's crucial for airlines to demonstrate accountability and provide timely updates to affected customers. I hope that by sharing my experience, SpiceJet will take necessary steps to address the underlying issues and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

### “Do not book SpiceJet”
Not Verified | Our flight got cancelled and they told us that the flight can't land because of bad weather. Weather was really good and they denied us accommodation because of this. They asked us to rebook the ticket as the ticket is now cancelled. After a long fight till late night 1am, they reschedule our flight to next day which was again cancelled next day. This is happening almost every day as we got to know from inside shop owners. It's really pathetic and a horrible experience. Lots of people cancelled and rebooked at 5 times of the actual flight rate. Do not book SpiceJet otherwise the risk is yours.

### "the worst airline in the country"
This is probably the worst airline in the country. There’s not one point in my entire journey where I’ve not regretted choosing this airline. Their ground staff are extremely rude and threaten to deplane you if you have any qualms about anything. We had to wait for an hr for our luggage to arrive because the airline chose to park the plane in T2, however the arrival being in T1.

### “a joy to have on board“
Not Verified | I would like to highly compliment you on one of your flight attendants, Devaiah Napanda, he was the economy class flight attendant on SpiceJet on 24th March 2024 from Ayodya to Bengaluru. He was attentive, competent, pleasant, helpful, humorous, cheerful, professional - just a joy to have on board. Thank you so much.

### "condition is very bad"
Aircraft condition is very bad. Chair is not working properly, Tv is not working  Tv panel is broken There is no cleanness is flight, ac vent not working properly.

### "a third class service"
Not Verified |  Even after the flight was delayed 5 hours, there was no food, no water, and it was like yesterday, everything was very bad in SpiceJet. I have come to Bhubaneshwar to Delhi earlier this time and even though I was late for 3 hours, I have never checked the book before Even if someone gives me crores of rupees, I will not book again. Spicejet is a third class service, they also charge more money.

### “a pleasant journey”
It was a pleasant journey on this SpiceJet flight. Air-hostess are so kind and helpful. Supported well for senior citizens with great hospitality. Thanks to SpiceJet team.

### "Great travel experience"
Marvelous courteous crew who took good care of all passengers. They should be rewarded for the patience shown towards the unruly ones. Great travel experience.

### "journey has been the best"
I have been traveling frequently over flights these days and I should say this flight journey has been the best, especially the cabin crew for their wonderful service. Kudos to the flight crew Simran, harmanpreet and Arpita for their great hospitality. Keep doing the great work.

### "outstanding service provided"
I wanted to express my sincere appreciation for the outstanding service provided by SpiceJet. I would like to commend the flight attendants for their dedication to ensuring passenger comfort and satisfaction. Thank you for maintaining such high standards of customer service. My experience on SpiceJet Flight SG4005 was truly memorable, and I look forward to flying with SpiceJet again in the future.

### “outstanding efforts and exemplary service”
I recently had the pleasure of traveling on Flight SG958 from Srinagar to Delhi on February 23rd, and I am compelled to share my gratitude for the exceptional hospitality extended by the entire team and crew. From the moment I stepped onto the aircraft until the moment of disembarkation, the hospitality team and crew demonstrated a level of professionalism, warmth, and dedication that truly exceeded my expectations. Their commitment to ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable travel experience was evident in every interaction and gesture throughout the flight. Despite the challenges and uncertainties of travel, the hospitality team and crew on SG958 remained composed and attentive, catering to the needs of passengers with efficiency and grace. Their genuine smiles, proactive assistance, and prompt service contributed significantly to the overall positive atmosphere onboard. I was particularly impressed by the team’s adherence to safety protocols while maintaining a welcoming and hospitable environment onboard. Their seamless execution of duties and unwavering focus on passenger well-being deserve commendation. I want to express my sincere appreciation to the entire team and crew of Flight SG958 for their outstanding efforts and exemplary service. They have undoubtedly set a high standard for airline hospitality and left a lasting impression on me as a passenger. Thank you for making my journey from Srinagar to Delhi on February 23rd a truly memorable and pleasant experience.

### “they refused to take responsibility”
SpiceJet proved to be incredibly disappointing and untrustworthy in my recent experience. Traveling with my family, a total of six individuals, we embarked on a journey from Amritsar (ATQ), India to DXB (Dubai) on February 24, 2024. The scheduled departure time was 08:40 AM, with a connecting flight from Dubai to London Heathrow at 14:30 Hrs via Emirates. Our ticket was booked through the booking.com portal as a single ticket, rather than separate bookings to facilitate the connection. However, our experience with SpiceJet quickly turned sour. Departing from ATQ, the flight was delayed by 55 minutes. Upon arrival in Dubai, we encountered further frustration as we remained onboard the aircraft for over an hour and a half without disembarkation. Initially, we were given excuses regarding weather conditions, despite the clear and sunny day in Dubai, and optimal weather conditions for take-off. Eventually, a member of the ground staff revealed the truth - the delay was due to SpiceJet's scheduling issues and the busy nature of Dubai airport. This delay resulted in us missing our connecting flight to London Heathrow. Expecting assistance from SpiceJet, we hurried to their counter hoping for a resolution. However, to our dismay, they refused to take responsibility or provide any alternative solutions. Their staff was unhelpful and dismissive, leaving us stranded in Dubai with our children. Consequently, we were forced to purchase new tickets at a staggering cost of £4061 to secure our journey back to the UK. I feel compelled to caution others against falling victim to this airline's deceptive practices. SpiceJet's lack of accountability and disregard for customer welfare make them a company to avoid at all costs.

### "they cancelled my ticket"
Not Verified | I booked ticket return from Ayodhya to Chennai through agent. Before travel 3 days they cancelled my ticket. Told me to rebook again same tickets & price 4000 rs more. Please don’t fly or book.

### "worst customer service"
Not Verified | Worst airline in India. Rude staff, worst customer service. No notification of flight delays. They start notifying you hardly 10 mins before the boarding starts. Their flights keep delaying every hour. Avoid this airline under all circumstances.

### "Very bad experience"
I reached the airport 45 minutes before takeoff but at the boarding pass counter they denied me for boarding and said that I am late. When I requested them they charged 3000 rupees extra for boarding. I was travelling from Patna to Jaipur via Delhi. When I reached Delhi the flight connecting flight was delayed again. I was waiting from 3 pm till 7 pm. My flight was at 9 pm but at 7 pm I got message that flight has been canceled due technical issues. Now they are not refunding the amount. Very bad experience. I would never suggest anyone to travel with this airline.

### “Staff were very kind and polite”
I have already shared my experience to colleagues and friends and the trip was wonderful and service was good. Staff were very kind and polite. Travel was very comfortable.

### "couldn't even recognize my bag"
I reached Mumbai airport and I was waiting for my luggage as usual but after waiting for like 30-45 minutes I went to counter to inform about my luggage than they told me that my luggage never reached Mumbai and now I have to fill up a form in order get my luggage delivered at my home. They claimed that my luggage will be delivered to my place by next day but of course it didn't, I tried calling on no that they provide while filling up that form but no one picked up the call in 3 days, when I went back to the airport office counter they said your baggage is still in Dubai. When I called Dubai branch they told me its in Mumbai, so no one is actually taking the responsibility, after 5 long hours of wait in the airport I lost my temper and as soon as I started to shout one SpiceJet staff approached me and said "Sir your luggage is here but as there are too many of them from other passengers as well its hard to find". After this I started to shout and there were a lot of passenger's who were there for the exact same reason joined me when they saw this happening they called me and said my luggage is found in the warehouse and will be here by any moment, and after 10-15 minutes my luggage arrived and I couldn't even recognize my bag as it was completely trashed.

### "didn't get our luggage"
Not Verified |  We had an early morning flight from Dubai to Jaipur, when we go to claim the baggage from belt 2 only one of our bags came. They said to us very rudely that our luggage did not come on the plane in Dubai that means your luggage is left in Dubai. They made us sign a form that said that our luggage will come on the next flight from Dubai. But today (next day) we didn't get our luggage, we are calling continuously but they didn't pick our phone.

### "poor customer service"
Not Verified |   Such a poor customer service. Actually my flight was scheduled at 12pm today. But later I received a notification informing that the flight is rescheduled to 845pm. When I contacted the customer care he just responded irresponsibly. He couldn't tell us whether they will inform us about the revised time 3 hrs prior. He just spoke as if he doesn't care about a customer's concern.

### "my luggage was sent to Mumbai"
I came to Kolkata but my luggage was sent to Mumbai. I came there complaining, I have emergency documents, I need them soon, it's been 5 days today Now he didn't come to my Luggage.

### “a very harrowing experience”
Not Verified | It was a very harrowing experience to book SpiceJet flight SG0215 on 13.01.24 which was supposed to take off at 5.15 am. We rushed to the airport late evening of 12.01.24, only to find flight was delayed multiple times. Finally it took off at 8.45 am only. Staff were least bothered about passengers convenience and they were very rude in their approach. Not even tea/coffee was offered for inordinate delay. Breakfast was given after umpteen requests from aggrieved flyers at around 7.30 pm for which we had to stand in long queue. I sincerely suggest never ever to book SpiceJet flight. This really frustrated my entire family and spoiled our holiday mood and festive fervour.

### "Do not book Spicejet flights"
Nightmare experience with a toddler. We booked a direct flight from Mumbai to Jaisalmer with SpiceJet in June for the Xmas holidays. Come a week before the flight SpiceJet starts smsing and emailing us that there is no direct flight and we will need to choose an alternative flight with a connection in Delhi and 10 hour layover options. At such a last minute all airfares were exorbitant and it was impossible to rebook flights even if we took refund. We wrote to them asking for a hotel stay for the layover. This was denied too. They held on to our money for 6 months before doing this. This is not where the ordeal ends. The first flight was delayed. Sat on the runway for over an hour before take off. We had to rush and change terminals. We were assured that our suitcases would reach Jaisalmer with us by every flight attendant and their airport staff. They did not. We were stranded without our winter wear and suitcases for 2 days in Jaisalmer till our suitcases were given to us the next day. We were forced to spend thousands of rupees on new clothes for the entire family. We asked them to reimburse this amount too. They did not. We asked for our choice of sandwich as per their menu. They did not have it. Do not book Spicejet flights even if you’re getting them for free. Take this as a warning before you spoil you entire vacation you have been planning and looking forward to for months.

### "a disheartening experience"
I recently had a disheartening experience with SpiceJet. My flight on November 28 was delayed by a staggering 6 hours, prompting me to book an alternative with another airline. The real frustration began when I sought a refund for the delayed flight. Despite daily calls to their customer service, there has been zero progress. The only consistent thing I've received from SpiceJet is false promises that I will get the revert on mail within 6 hours. It's been a month, and I'm still waiting for a revert mail. This lack of responsiveness and accountability is unacceptable. I expected better service, especially in handling situations involving significant delays. If you value your time and money, think twice before choosing SpiceJet. My experience has been nothing short of disappointing.

### "left us deeply dissatisfied"
Not Verified |  We had pre-booked flight tickets from Delhi to Hyderabad, expecting a 7 am departure. Unfortunately, the flight experienced multiple delays: first pushed to 8 am, then further delayed to 10:50 am, 11 am, and finally 12:15 pm. These continuous delays were quite challenging for us, significantly disrupting our schedule. The airline's inefficiency led to a waste of our precious time. When we requested lounge access due to the prolonged delay, the airline offered a meal instead. There were murmurs among passengers about SpiceJet's limited staffing and flights, suggesting that they might be playing games with travelers. Overall, the lack of support and the series of delays left us deeply dissatisfied. Based on this experience, I strongly advise against booking a flight with SpiceJet, even if they offer enticing deals.

### "Never travel through SpiceJet"
Not Verified |  Terrible experience. Flight had been delayed for almost 6 hours. We are travelling through SpiceJet airlines and currently stuck at Jaipur airport for almost 3 hours . According to them it is just because of fog. We also missed our second flight due to this. Never travel through SpiceJet.

### “horrendous customer service”
Not Verified |  It was the worst experience, coupled with horrendous customer service. They postponed the flight at the last minute on a beautiful sunny afternoon, nearly causing me to miss my international flight to Australia. Fortunately, I managed to secure another airline ticket, albeit at double the original price. There was a complete lack of empathy and an absence of any apology for the substantial financial loss and mental anguish I endured. Despite assurances that my ticket had been canceled and a refund processed, a last-minute check revealed that my ticket was still active. Airlines like SpiceJet and travel agencies such as Happy Fares: engaging with them felt like participating in a racket.

### "keep delaying the flights often"
The flight was supposed to be departed at 10.55am from Chennai, it is currently 12.58pm and the boarding has not even commenced. The flight has been delayed without any proper communication for more than 4 times and it seems this is not the first time this Spicejet route is delayed. If they know that there is a discrepancy n regulatory requirement for flights to have an one-hour maintenance after an international trip, the spicejet team should have an alternate carrier or avoid this route. They keep delaying the flights often.

### "not up to par with standards"
Spicejet services are not up to par with standards. Heavily delayed flight schedule. Flight delayed for more than 4 hours. The delay impacts a lot. Wheelchair assistance was ordered but the very impolite ground staff in Kolkata Airport. The ground staff showed tempers in front of customers. Cabin crew has a professional attitude but have a restricted leg space.

### "Terrible service"
Terrible service by the airline. All the flights that I took this year with spiceJet were delayed by atleast 4-5 hours each. Also, they don’t inform the passengers via text/ mail regarding the delays to waste your precious time. Will never book spicejet again. This company should literally stop their operations, recent stats show that almost 100% of their flights are delayed.

### "Horrible experience with this airline"
This airline should shut down. Re-scheduled many times. I took a margin of 5 hours between my follow up train. Indian railways was bang on time and even 5 hours were not enough for them to resolve their internal problems. I missed my train and was sitting helpless at airport in mid ight with my kids. Horrible experience with this airline.

### "Rescheduled so many times"
Not Verified |  12 hours late. No ground arrangements, No food provided. Rescheduled so many times. Not only my flight other Mumbai Kolkata and Delhi flight were delayed beyond limit. No valid reason for delay. No blankets provided to customers even after demand. Even at the time of boarding, no announcement

### “no facilities provided”
I have booked my SpiceJet flight from DXB to BOM airport, this flight was delayed for 7 hrs  but there was no email or call from customer services, around 200 passengers are waiting for the flight. It was my worst experience ever and the same for more than 199 passengers experience. Also there was no facilities provided such as hotel appointments or food or offering a glass of water to passengers. I’m highly recommending to not ever book this flight.

### "Truly third class airline"
Flight canceled. The staff has regret no feelings for passengers. I was so depressed where to go with my daughter at 12 am. Truly third class airline.

### "Their timeliness is the worst"
SpiceJet is the worst airline in the world. My last 5 SpiceJet experiences. 1 flight cancellation, 1 airport change, 3 flights depart delayed twice to thrice. SpiceJet interior experience is the worst, their on-ground services are pathetic. Their customer service is unresponsive. Their timeliness is the worst. Please avoid this worst service provider if possible.

### "completely unreliable"
Not Verified | The worst airline ever, period! A really disappointing encounter. To begin with, their website loads incredibly slowly due to its terrible user experience. Despite everyone's criticism, I made my first-ever flight reservation due to some time constraints, and guess what? They were entirely correct. My flight, which was scheduled to depart at 10:20 pm, was originally changed to 1:55 am, extended to 4:10 am, and then delayed again to 4:40am while I was at the airport. Being a professional with a demanding schedule, I trusted and reserved this flight to have surgery the next morning. Please consider other airlines before making a commitment with Spicejet. This airline is completely unreliable. I have been away from home for nearly six years, and no other airline has ever caused me these kind of problems.

### "staff is rude and arrogant"
It's better to not fly if this is the last option for you to fly. The flight is delayed is no reason. The time of delay is never communicated. The duration of delay can ever extend. And the biggest issue is that they won't ever approach or be available to address the concerns of the passengers. The response to why the delay happened will be so technical that you will wish to not have asked for it. The staff is rude and arrogant. In short, avoid this at all costs unless you have nothing to do on the day you wish to fly and are okay to spend time walking around the airport or spend time shopping at the airport.

### "I enjoyed my journey"
It was a brilliant experience with this airline, I have flew many time with other airline, but, I enjoyed my journey with this airline and the staff. Behavior of the staff is very polite and sweet.

### "No proper customer support"
Not Verified |  Very worst airline. No proper customer support. They will change flight departure time for there comfortable time. Won’t refund the money if the issue is from SpiceJet. Won’t give any prior message if the flight get cancelled by text message or by WhatsApp. SpiceJet is good only for promotions. No response from airport SpiceJet customer care in Mumbai airport terminal no1. Because this change I have spent 3000rs for cab for travelling to airport.

### "must value its customer's time"
Flight has been delayed up to 1.20 hrs. Being a passenger delay is understandable or adjustable upto 10-15 mins in the worst scenario 30 mins but 1.2 hrs is too late. Spicejet must value its customer's time.

### "seats were broken and worn out"
At check in the lady asked for my ticket i have presented it via my phone and then took the boarding pass and proceeded to immigration, upon asking about my visa at the immigration I realized that I forget my phone at the check in counter, I rushed back to the counter and asked the lady about my phone then surprisingly with a very casual attitude she said ( yeh it’s here ). Later the flight got delayed by 3 hours and 30 mins without any proper notice, to my surprise while checking upon the same with the airlines ground staff they were completely clueless of why this flight is getting delayed. The condition of the aircraft itself was far from satisfactory, seats were broken and worn out. My seat belt was broken and when I introduced it to the crew member they have no good choices and asked me to wear the broken seat belt.

### "worst experience I ever had"
Not Verified |  The worst experience I ever had. The flight was delayed by 30 mins first then delayed again but we were not even informed about that and just stalled for an hour more. After that on arrival we were informed that even our luggage hasn't been transported and will be delivered the next day. 5am in the morning we were asked to fill forms for the same. The level of unprofessionalism is just too much. The best advice I can give to any fellow traveller is spend a bit more but don't prefer this airline.

### "No compensation or apology offered"
The management of flights and addressing customer care issues is extremely unprofessional. Flight from Bagdogra got delayed by 3 hours. No compensation or apology offered. The flight from Kolkata to Port Blair got cancelled and the only thing I received was an automated message saying it's cancelled. The link given in the same message showed me no flights available. Customer care executive picked up after calling for the 10th time and waiting for almost 20 mins on the line. The resolution offered? She said don't get on the Bagdogra flight. Contact staff at the airport. Wouldn't have called if that had helped. Extremely unprofessional in sticking to the planned take off time. And my complaints were treated like a bother and received half hearted efforts from staff at every level. Even now, as I'm waiting at Kolkata airport, it seems likely that there will be delays and more inconvenience.

### “a pretty good flight”
On my return to Mumbai from Kolkata, the airline auto-assigned me a random seat as I had selected that option during the web check-in. The baggage drop process at CCU airport was smooth and boarding also started on time. This time I was pleased to notice that the crew members were actually greeting all the passengers which was much better compared to the last time I had flown them. Departure was smooth and as this was an overnight flight the cabin lights were dimmed for most of the flight. Descent and landing were on time followed by a swift luggage retrieval. Overall for the price that was paid this was a pretty good flight. The airline has been undergoing a lot of difficulties in recent times but if it can keep up this level of work it will be good.

### "it was the happiest trip"
We are very happy to be with the crews Ms Shanti and Shemin at the board of SG 17. It was our flight on Spicejet with "Manav" 8 months old our son. They are very nicely taken care of our son on board and provided all the assistance whenever needed. It was the happiest trip we had travelled in a while. Thankyou so much for Shanti, Shemin and all other members who assisted us. Have great future ahead.

### "they enforce a strict 7 kg limit"
On 25 September 2023, I had the misfortune of flying with SpiceJet on flight [SG 17] from Dubai to Cochin. SpiceJet has  a weighing machine at the entrance to check the weight of each passenger's hand luggage and they enforce a strict 7 kg limit. If you exceed this limit, you are charged a70 AED per kg. This situation is unacceptable and amounts to nothing less than exploitation of passengers who choose SpiceJet for budget-friendly fares. To add to the disappointment, the condition of the aircraft itself was far from satisfactory. The seats looked worn out, and the cabin appearance was lackluster. I urge fellow travelers to exercise caution when considering SpiceJet for your flights.

### "Excellent service"
Excellent service by the ground staff courteous beyond expectations always willing to help in the real sense and not lipservice i will recommend to all whom I know

### "a decent functional experience"
I had taken this evening flight to Calcutta, during the web check-in, I had opted for the random seat selection for which there would be no charges applied as I was travelling solo, so before 12 hours of the departure, I had received the seat. Check-in was done at the old T1 terminal at BOM where baggage drop was done swiftly as there was no line and queues which was surprising. The boarding started on time however I noticed that when I was about to greet the crew there were 2 crew members who were not really greeting any of the passengers and seem surprised that I wished them good evening when they reciprocated. Ideally greeting the passengers is something that should be standard. Also I noticed that the load on this flight was on the lighter side as well however due to the ATC clearances the actual pushback and departure was delayed by over 1 hour but this was not on the airline. The pilots did a good job of keeping the passengers updated about the reasons for the delay. The flight itself was operated on one of those Boeing 737-800NG aircraft that was painted in the erstwhile JetConnect liveries. The pilots tried to make the time en route on the flight and was able to retrieve my luggage soon without waiting too long. While Spicejet has been going through a lot of difficulties in recent times, and that was also reflected in the manner in which the crew seemed disinterested in greeting the passengers, there are still small things that the airline can do which can still make a small difference to the passenger experience because otherwise for the fare that was paid this was a decent functional experience that was able to get me safely to my destination.

### "Not a good experience"
Not Verified |  I booked the ticket from cleartrip app and I select window seat, but during boarding pass they change my seat from window to middle. I paid 300 for that seat. There no support from spicejet team. Not a good experience, seat is not good.

### "I was denied boarding"
I recently booked a ticket from Chennai to Delhi on 6th September 2023. But, sadly I had to encounter the worst experience with Spicejet, where I was denied boarding on a mere request of writing only 2 words on the excess baggage receipt - "Laptop Bag" after payment of the excess baggage charges for the laptop bag that I was carrying. Such conduct from Spicejet was very unprofessional and dissatisfactory. When a customer pays the ticket price, he owns the right to travel through the flight and taking away this right is illegal in all terms. I cannot understand if there is a policy of spicejet to charge amounts for a laptop bag, what made the team cancel my onboarding on the request of adding these 2 words - "Laptop Bag" on the excess baggage charge payment receipt. To my utmost surprise, when I raised this with Spicejet, they are saying that I have only refused to travel and they did not deny onboarding. This is completely false, as any sensible person can vouch for it - if I would have to refuse travel I would not have even paid the excess baggage charges in the first instance. This is a pure betrayal from spicejet. At least, they should have the guts to accept what they did. They have even refused to refund the ticket price.

### "A very bad experience"
Not Verified |  A very bad experience. The boarding was early but the take off, the landing, everything else was late. Even though we paid extra for leg space, we did not get any leg space our money was waste I also attached a photo showing how less out leg space was even though we paid extra money for it. We were supposed to land at 7:20 but we landed at 8. The luggage did not arrive till 9 even though the landing was at 8 we had to wait an hour for the luggage and the manager who was standing there also had 0 communication of where our luggage was. Indigo the flight which arrived later than spicejet also received their luggage on the same belt before us. A very bad experience one can say never flying in SpiceJet ever again.

### "Ground staff were excellent"
Not Verified |  Many changes to schedule, but communication was good. Ground staff were excellent dealing with delayed baggage problem, caused by my mistake in packing.

### "Disheartening Experience"
Not Verified |  Disheartening Experience - Unprofessional Staff and Unreasonable Charges. My recent journey with SpiceJet from Calicut to Dubai was a complete disappointment. The check-in process was marred by unprofessional behavior from the staff. We encountered an unfortunate experience with the staff, who displayed aggression and utter disrespect towards passengers. Adding to the distress, the staff demanded an exorbitant additional charge for our luggage, including an unreasonable claim for my baby's stroller, which we had previously taken on the same route without any problems during our outbound flight. This inconsistency and unjustified charge left us deeply dissatisfied. Despite providing proof of double payment, SpiceJet is yet to refund the excessive amount they charged us under duress. It is disheartening to see an airline of this stature failing to provide basic customer satisfaction. I sincerely hope Spice Jet takes immediate action and thoroughly trains their staff to treat passengers with respect and empathy. As loyal customers, we expect a better travel experience and fair treatment. This incident has left me questioning whether I should ever consider flying with SpiceJet again.

### "I am satisfied and contented"
Being bit unwell, the cabin crew took personal care of my condition. They offered me foods and drinks to help me remain stable throughout the journey. The crew gave high level of service and attention. I am satisfied and contented.

### "No respect for passengers time"
If you are boarding a flight by SpiceJet, just know that they will delay by five hours. My flight, without blink of eye, was shifted from 4.30 to 8. And will there be another postponement? Who knows? The last time I travelled by SpiceJet in Oct 2022 from Calcutta to Delhi the flight which was supposed to leave at 9.45pm, left in the morning. They kept delaying all night, this flight was SG8252. This is BY FAR the worst airline I have ever been on and the experience is bad every single time. No respect for the passengers time at all. Horrifying.

### "I have not received my refund"
Not Verified |  I booked spice jet ticket on 16th August 2023 for Mumbai to Goa and Goa to Mumbai 15 passengers total Rs 69,114 was debited from my credit card and due to some technical reason my ticket was canceled, but asked for refund of the debited amount. hey mailed me and said that the money will be deposited in 48 hours but even after mailing I have not received my refund.

### "Service is very good"
Service is very good,  I am impressed with Miss Renu  who gave the best services ever. Thanks to Renu who is very sweet by her nature as well as her service

### "SpiceJet experience was good"
Not Verified | SpiceJet experience was good. The crew members service and behaviour was also good. I can rate my flight experience on SpiceJet airlines flight 10/10.

### "great service from crew"
Not Verified | Great on boarding and great service from crew. They greeted me with a smile and patience. Without asking the moment I got to my seat I was served with water.

### "Our flight was delayed 3 times"
Not Verified |  Our flight was delayed 3 times (from 6 it became 7:14 then 8:10 and then 8:55) and even when the flight was delayed for the 3rd time they weren't sure if they're going to delay it again or not. They said it was because of a ‘technical difficulty’ but all the flights had been delayed so it definitely wasn't that. We demanded for free food but even that wasn't provided. We finally boarded the plane at 8:30 after arguing a lot. This was my first and last experience with them.

### "They kept delaying the departure"
They kept delaying the departure 1 hour and again another hour, and again another hour. After almost 2.5 hours and making passenger sit in flight they say their is technical glitch.

### "Worse service ever"
Worse service ever, misleading information, also they will charge you extra money in each step so if your ticket price is 1000 Aed then you will ending up paying 2000 because of their stupid policies. If you don’t like then they ask you board other flight

### "an utter disappoint"
Worst domestic flying experience ever. They were constantly changing the timings of the flight, they were not taking any responsibility for delaying the flight and not even offered us refreshment willingly which is the in rules. My original flight was in 8:10 a.m. but after all the delays and rescheduling it started boarding in 7:00 p.m. Their behaviour was very rude and they won't take any responsibility for anything. 2 fellow passengers were in the airport since 12pm but they didn't offered them any refreshment or anything. SpiceJet is an utter disappoint as flight service provider. I would never every recommend SpiceJet for any kind of flying.

### "Really worst experience"
First of all please don’t trust on SpiceJet. They never on time. They can kill your planning. Unlimited rescheduling. If you have any urgent work, inter change of flight be careful. Really worst experience.

### "Inflight experience is wonderful"
Ground Staff and Customer Service Staff are very helpful and supportive. Inflight experience is wonderful and spice max facilities are an added advantage. Thank you and keep up the good work .

### "cancelled and no alternative flight available"
Not Verified | I had booked a flight from New Delhi to Shirdi travel date 17-June-23 and had accordingly booked my hotel and other itineraries. The booking was done way in advance to make sure everything is in order. Now 2 days back I received an SMS from SpiceJet that the flight has been cancelled and there is no alternative flight available. I spoke to SpiceJet agent and requested them to arrange a flight for me on another carrier which is Indigo on which I was told that I need to write to higher authorities. This is plainly making a fool out of the customer as now the only direct flight which is available is Indigo and is more than double the price I paid for SpiceJet flight booked in advance. SpiceJet always does this with their customers. If they are unable to operate they should shut down operations but shouldn’t cheat the customers. I had to pay INR 12000 extra for the alternate flight to reach Shirdi.

### "Worst airline ever"
My husband was traveling from Dubai to Delhi, his flight was supposed to be on 11:00 am which got delayed and scheduled at 6:00 pm. He waited there at the airport patiently and now they are asking him to reschedule his flight after 2 days or take total refund. Worst airline ever.

### "The worst airline to fly with"!
The worst airline to fly with in terms of time management. Last 5 flights I have taken with this airlines has resulted in dela . Todays flight is been already delayed by 1.5hr, which is very big disadvantage for me. The seats are uncomfortable and leg space is very minimal. Strongly don't recommend and not planning to take any further trips with this airlines

### "One of the worst flights"
Not Verified | Staff at Delhi Airport misbehaved, insulted me and did not allowed me to board the SG 8192 from Delhi to Mumbai on 6 Jun 23 which was rescheduled from 1820 hrs to 1925 hrs on 6 Jun 23. SpiceJet did not send any SMS/email for reschedule. When I reached Airport at 1750hrs (85 min before), Security Staff at Airport didn't allowed me to enter as I couldn't show any SMS/email of reschedule. At 1825 I could enter and rushed to Spice Jet counter but they didn't allow to board the flight. When I shown my defence Id and informed that I am on official operational duties. They insulted me and still didn't allow to board the flight. One of the worst flights SpiceJet

### "Will not consider this airline anymore"
Not Verified |  Pathetic and Terrible. Changed the schedule more than 10 times since the booking. At one stage the departure flight from destination became earlier dated than the departure flight from the origin. Due to this, I had to cancel my tickets and suffer losses. Will not consider this airline anymore. Worst experience. I think they make their revenue by people cancelling the flights rather flying with them. Long Live SpiceJet.

### "Terrible terrible experience"
Not Verified | Delhi-Pune. The staff has no answers for our queries. Can't get valid explanations for flight delays, even for the ones as long as 10 hrs. They need to work on their management or shut the airlines. We look forward to flying with airlines like Vistara, Air India, Indigo, rather than an airline like this. When you look at the screen, you only find SpiceJet flights delayed. Terrible terrible experience.

### "Pathetic experience"
They kept changing flight timing from 8 pm on 1 June 2023 to 11:45 pm to 3.15 am on 2 June 2023. This keeps happening very regularly. Why do they give the initial timing when this delay happens so frequently. And staff are so less sensitive. No display about flight delay at boarding gate. Pathetic experience. Try to book one day in advance if someone is left with no other option than this airline.

### "stay away from this airline"
Not Verified |  Such a lousy airline. They keep changing their departure timings so often that one would forget the real departure time. If possible stay away from this airline. They have delayed the flight timing by 5 hours and they have changed the departure timing thrice.

### "no courtesy shown to us by SpiceJet"
We are a family of 3 and had booked a flight to Guwahati from Mumbai for 6.10am for Wednesday 17th May 2023. It was supposed to reach around 10. We had an onwards journey to Shillong. When we tried to check in, we realised that flight has changed to evening 19.00 hrs. To avoid losing a day in Shillong, we had to book a day prior and had to book a stay in Guwahati. Spent around 20k more. This flight was delayed by 30 min. On our return journey, we had a ticket from Guwahati for 17.10 hrs on 21st May 2023. Reaching Mumbai back at 20.30 hrs same day. While we tried checking in previous day, we learnt that flight time has changed to 23.30 hrs. And reaching back at 3.00am the next day. We had no choice as other airline flights were not available for 3 people or exorbitantly expensive. We had to continue and checked in. The flight was delayed from scheduled 23.30 hrs on 21st May to 00.45am on 22nd May. We have landed on T2 terminal at 4.20am. We have lost sleep, money and an entire of work day pre travel and post travel. We have barely slept. They have offered a sandwich and Rajma Chawl at the airport. It is a hardship which we will never forget and not recommend SpiceJet to anyone. The leg space between the chair is extremely low. An average height person like us was hitting knee to the seat ahead. Extremely bad experience both ways. There was no courtesy shown to us by SpiceJet ground staff and cabin crew. Just a customary apology was given. We will never recommend Spicejet airlines to anyone. If there was a zero star or negative star to rate, would have picked it to rate the service.

### "seats were not as expected"
One of the worst experiences on a flight. I was heading out from New Delhi to Bangalore and it was not worth the effort. The seats were not as expected cleaned, the seat covers was teared from one side, likewise the seat which is allotted to me don't had the seat movable button since it was broken, so all through the entire excursion I needed to sit truly awkward.

### "horrible and insensitive experience"
Booked a spicejet from port blair to Chennai on 6th May. After check-in was done and making us wait for 2 hours, flight was cancelled with a reason of operational issue. This cancellation happened after the flight was delayed 3 times. Spicejet is so horrible that they couldn’t arrange us another flight or consider rebooking our connecting flights. I had my another flight booked from Chennai to Bangalore on the same day which I had to cancel without any refund and spicejet just said "Sorry". Though spicejet gave accomodation which I never wanted this was a horrible and insensitive experience I had with spicejet.

### "behaviour was not at all satisfactory"
When I enter the airport, Spicejet person asked me whether I am having a printed boarding pass or not. I said that I am having the printed boarding pass and it's in my mobile, then he asked me to go the luggage dropping counter. The staff who was on the desk checked the weight of the luggage and asked me to screen the luggage and drop it in luggage belt. I said it's only hand luggage so I asked him to allow to carry with me. I also told him that I have travelled from Mumbai with same Hand luggage before two days. But he rudely asked me put in the luggage as the weight of the luggage is 8kgs. I requested him as I am having a connecting flight to Bhubaneswar so plz allow as it is just 1kg above the limit. But his behaviour was not at all satisfactory. I am posting this at 1:30pm sitting at boarding gate. Boarding is scheduled at 12:55pm and Boarding is not started.

### "The services are very pathetic"
The services are very pathetic. The flight is re scheduled 3 times in a day. The worst part is they do no provide any compensation for the flights they delay. Not only today’s flight but the flight I have booked for 19 may is also rescheduled. SpiceJet didn’t informed me about the same. The broker Cleartrip has informed about the same. I will have rethink about my decision for travelling in SpiceJet as I m not able to reach anywhere on time. My meetings, functions are all delayed because of the airline. My continuous 2 flights is been rescheduled to a different date.

### "we are highly disappointed"
Not Verified |  This is our first experience with Spicejet and we are highly disappointed. This is probably the worst Airline. Our flight got rescheduled 3 times and we had to wait for like 7 hours on the Airport which was so exhausting. Just one word - Pathetic

### "I could not fly anywhere"
I had a complicated flight Goa-Chennai, Chennai-Dubai with IndiGo, and Wizz Air Dubai-Kutaisi. The employees at the airport told me that the first flight was delayed, and because of that I didn't get on all the other flights, and they couldn't offer me an alternative route. Because of this I could not fly anywhere, and my Indian visa expires, which threatens me with a fine and deportation. SpiceJet employees told me that they could refund my money only for the first flight in full, but even that did not comply and deducted a fine of 2930 rubles, writing that I did not show up at check-in, although I have an official letter from the employees.

### "Highly disappointed"
Not Verified |  Very poor services. Highly disappointed. Round trip flight was booked, cancelled my return flight and didn't even compensate or accomodate me in other flight.

### "Customer care unresponsive and rude"
Not Verified | SpiceJet pathetic. Pathetic. Pathetic. Pathetic. My flight was scheduled @22:15 on 18th Mar 2023, I reached airport by 7:30 PM to avoid last minute hassle. The flight was rescheduled @01:05 AM 19th March, again rescheduled @02:05 AM, again rescheduled @03:10 AM. I am writing this review on the same travel day and I am still waiting for boarding to start. What passengers have to go through only they can understand. When you have flight late evening you try to reach airport early and spend entire night at the airport. Customer care at the airport was unresponsive and rude. Twice I have travelled with SpiceJet and both the times similar experience.

### "Worst airline in India"
Worst airline in India, they will cancel your ticket any time and offer you a full refund before 2 days of departure date. After that if you check for a new flight to book you will need to pay 3 times more than you got as a refund amount.

### "Horrible flight services"
Not Verified |  Horrible flight services. The flight was initially at 7:30 pm, it being an international flight everyone was here by 4pm to avoid the any discrepancies, only to the find out the flight has been delayed to 8:30 and slowly to 9:40 then 10:40 then 11:10. With that the gate number changed for 44 to 76, travelling with aged people it is so difficult to change gates. When given a certain time for a flight going abroad, the airline is supposed to take care on everything the passengers have planned. Other than a bit of food compensation the SpiceJet staff has not been helpful what do ever. They aren’t even admitting their mistake and saying the flight is delayed they are telling all the passengers that the system is wrong we have the right information. This is horrible service by the airline and they should really improve on following schedules.

### "Flight time was changed 3 times"
Flight time was changed 3 times and the last change was announced the night before our early morning flight from rajkot to Delhi. Originally leaving rajkot at 8:25am, changed to 9:30am, then at the airport was delayed 2 hours. Because of this change, we missed our connecting flight from Delhi to Dharamshala. The staff at the airport just shrug, zero sympathy. They told us the next flight we can get on from Delhi to Dharamshala is 2 days later while waiting for the next flight. No refund if we decided not to take the Delhi to Dharamshala flight. Nightmare!

### "I haven't come across a worse service"
Not Verified |  I haven't come across a worse service than the one offered by SpiceJet. SpiceJet really needs to start managing its check-in counters better. The staff at the airport just shrugged, showing zero sympathy. I entered the terminal 2 airport 1 hour 45 minutes prior, but the check-in counter was closed. I didn't even get to board my flight, and there was no information shared with me at all about online check-in. Besides all the promo mail, there wasn't any mail about online check-in. Instead, they let me all the way through to the gate and told me on the last moment that I was supposed to check-in, and the website was also not clear in that (I checked). The check-in counter was closed, and they didn't do anything for me other than tell me that I should have known somehow. Also, the flight was delayed for no reason. The flight departure time was 7:20 PM, but it was delayed by 26 minutes. No partial refund; no later flight instead; nothing. only telling me that I should have known somehow what the procedure is and pointing to the terms and conditions part on my e-ticket, which by the way says nothing about checking in. Be aware of this. No spicejet for me anymore.

### "the service was what was expected"
I had booked this flight a month before flying as it came at a very cheap and reasonable rate. The web check in for the flight was fine and I had opted for the auto seat selection without getting charged a fare for seat selection. So the boarding pass was given to me 12 hours before departure. The check in and baggage drop was smooth. The boarding started a bit late but we made up for that en route. Noted that I was flying on a 737 Max 8 type aircraft which had much bigger overhead storage bins and the seat pitch on board was on the generous side which was appreciated. Also the plane was much quieter. However when boarding, most of the flying attendants were busy working in the galleys and were not wishing the passengers which was rather unusual. Also it was observed that in the back of my seat pocket, the safety card was not present which was not good at all as this document is very necessary. The safety instructions and general service also seemed to be rushed on board the cabin. It felt as though the staff just wanted to get things through. Perhaps these factors along with the lack of staff friendliness highlight the issues that the airline is going through at the moment. It is to be noted that there is an onboard wifi named SpiceScreen which one can connect to their mobile devices free of charge. It had a decent selection of movies / podcasts / magazines which was much appreciated. The flight landed on time and baggage collection was done appropriately. On the whole, for the cheap fare that was paid, the service was what was expected and it's true that even though the airline is going through challenges, there are definitely aspects that should be taken care of.

### "Flight time was changed 3 times"
Flight time was changed 3 times and the last change was announced the night before our early morning flight from Jaipur to Dharamshala via Delhi. Originally leaving Jaipur at 6:25am, changed to 9:30am, then at the airport was delayed 2 hours. Because of this change, we missed our connecting flight from Delhi to Dharamshala. The staff at the airport just shrug, zero sympathy. They told us the next flight we can get on from Delhi to Dharamshala is 2 days later and we have to book our own airport hotel to stay 2 nights in Delhi while waiting for the next flight. No refund if we decided not to take the Delhi to Dharamshala flight. Nightmare!

### "It was the worst check in"
SpiceJet really needs to start managing it's check in counters better. No person available to guide passengers to empty counters, people moving from one counter to the other haphazardly in order to check-in faster. It was the worst check in have experienced. Please please please- don't make already exhausted people so angry that they snap at the staff on duty. The airline has value for money but does it mean we need to ignore all the other stupid mistakes that they make?

### "SpiceJet flights are always late"
SpiceJet flights are always late and passengers have to suffer to delays. Each time delay happens from Patna. The delay exceeds up to 8 Hrs. Very bad response from SpiceJet.

### "I didn't even get to my flight"
I didn't even get to my flight. It was a transfer flight and there was no information shared with me at all about online check in or that I had to check out and check back in again on my transfer flight. They only sent me a whole lot of promo mails which besides that it's annoying makes it hard to find the actual important mails in your inbox. Besides the all the promo mail, there wasn't any mail about online check in or that I had to check out from my transfer and check back in. Instead they let me all the way through to the gate and told me on the last moment that I was supposed to check out and back in. And the website was also not clear in that (I checked). I took a sprint to the check out and went back in, but check in was closed and they didn't do anything for me other than telling me that I should have known somehow. No (partly refund), no later flight instead, nothing. Only telling me that I should have known somehow what the procedure is and pointing to the terms and conditions part on my e-ticket, which by the way says nothing about checking out and back in in a transfer flight. Be aware of this. No spice jet for me anymore.

### "eventually cancelled the flight"
Not Verified | The worst flight ever. My flight got cancelled and they told 1 hour before the estimated time. Never recommend. It's not the first time they are taking off this flight but still they made sure that customers are made waited and then eventually cancelled the flight.

### "the worst customer experience"
Not Verified |  The flight timings was 1.10PM to start from Bangalore to Shirdi but we are waiting in the airport still its 5.25PM. No proper communication nor the exact timings given for the fight. This is the worst customer experience. We are waiting from 8 hours in the airport. When the flight is booked for afternoon but the flight is not arrived even after 6 hours from the scheduled time. Never will use SpiceJet nor recommend for others. Very bad experience.

### "There was a lack of clear communication"
I recently had a bad experience flying with SpiceJet due to significant delays and poor communication from the staff. My flight was initially delayed by several hours due to a mechanical issue, and the staff did a poor job of keeping passengers informed about the situation. There was a lack of clear communication about the cause of the delay and what steps were being taken to resolve the issue. Furthermore, when the flight finally did depart, it was further delayed due to additional issues with the plane. The staff did not seem particularly concerned about the impact of the delays on passengers and were unapologetic about the situation. Overall, my experience with SpiceJet Airlines was very disappointing and I would not recommend flying with them in the future.

### "It seems that SpiceJet has a new business model"
It seems that SpiceJet has a new business model: Selling people a cheap flight, annulate it and keep the money. Twice I had an annulated flight and the right to get my money back. The first flight it took me almost two months to get my money back and for this flight its impossible to reach them. Choose Indigo, we had several flights with this company, strictly on time (Dutch CEO).

### "Overall experience was ok"
SpiceJet is currently least preferred airline in India but as getting a good deal in last moment and schedule suits me go went with them. Overall experience was ok, certainly not bad. Flight departed on time and reached before time. As its a lcc so no meal included and nothing much expected. The aircraft used was on wet lease from Corendon airlines so even flight crew was from corendon, as they didn't know Hindi so that was a language problem with few passengers. Seat confirmation was same as Boeing 737 operated by spice jet, legroom was just ok for small route.

### "I haven't come across a worse service"
I haven't come across a worse service than the one offered by SpiceJet on 5th November 2022. I was travelling from Delhi to Udaipur on 5th Nov for a vacation. Not only was the flight cancelled without informing us wasting hours at the airport booking new flight basis availability but they did not even have the decency to refund the amount that was spent booking the flights. I am sick and tired of calling SpiceJet customer care but no one picks the calls. I know many customers here are thinking that this might be a 1 of incident but trust me I have faced multiple issues with SpiceJet in the past and if it can happen to me it can happen to anyone reading this as well. Save yourself some trouble and book another airline for your own sake! Can't expect anything from from the airlines after this pathetic service.

### "SpiceJet will be my last option for flying"
Not Verified |  Poor customer service. Flight timings were frequently changed. Poor communication. I flew SpiceJet 8709 from Delhi to Mumbai on 24th November 2022, SpiceJet will be my last option for flying.

### "Third grade airline service"
Very bad luggage service, most of the time passenger will not receive baggage even after reaching destination. No reply or support from the staff. Third grade airline service

### "Will never fly this airline again"
Spicejet is a risky airline to fly on if you have a connecting flight or need to be on time for business etc. My round trip flight from Dubai to Madurai was delayed on both ends, by 4-12 hours. When trying to switch my return to a different date so I wouldn’t miss my connecting flight to the US, I could not do it via online or phone - thankfully a contact in the airport was able to switch my flight. My payment done online for extra baggage did not show up so I had to pay again. Will never fly this airline again. But do want to mention that both in Dubai and Madurai and on the flight I did encounter kind staff members who did their best to help me. This airline needs to get its act together.

### "staff are very unprofessional"
This is worst Airline. The practice is to delay the flight 3 hours. Their staff are very unprofessional and rude.

### "Plan early and choose airlines with empathy"
I have heard of flight reschedules for half an hour, an hour or maybe a two hours, they rescheduled a flight by 8 hrs initially and a further half an hour later, had an important meeting in Goa and missed it. I kept calling them requesting for assistance to book me on an alternate airline as it was simply a meeting I couldn't miss, it was so important that I took a 6am clock flight from Guwahati to Mumbai just to get on this particular flight to be on time for my meeting at 2.30 pm, all they keep saying is "it's not their policy and I could reschedule my flight anytime for the next seven days" under the terms and conditions we accept while booking. You will never find a more boorish, crude and unreasonable airline like them, they kept me at Mumbai Airport for almost 10 hrs, no remorse even for our loss, the important meeting I missed, the expenses I had to endure in these 10 hrs in the airport and complete wastage of time. If you value your time and your pride, please do not suffer like me. Plan early and choose airlines with empathy, there was no external influence in these reschedules as other airlines were operating on time, it's just probably clubbing passengers of two separate flights to thicken their margins.

### "never travel again with this airline"
I was travelling from Delhi to Bangkok through Spicejet flight, and it was my worst experience. I had to wait 10 hours because of the delay in flight, I missed my next connecting flight also from Bangkok to Surat Thani due to their delay from Delhi. Also they delayed first only for 4 hours, and then kept delaying 4 more times. Although they arranged dinner for delayed passengers, and i was told by the receptionist of that restaurant in Delhi airport, that this type of delay is very common with SpiceJet. They messed up my whole schedule for the next day. I missed my meeting, my next flight, and lost my money of next flight ticket. Will never travel again with this airline!

### "Horrible experience"
Horrible experience, flight was scheduled at night 21:00, received notification in the afternoon that flight is rescheduled to 22:00 hrs and again received notification by evening that flight is again rescheduled to 23:00 hrs. After check in Goa Airport, again further flight is rescheduled to 0000 hrs. First time I am traveling in SpiceJet and it is worst

### "Try to avoid them as much as you can"
Not Verified |  Always had bad experiences with SpiceJet but still have to travel because of sector and flight time limitations. But they keep on amusing you every time you fly with them, if you think your last flight experience was bad, they make sure the next one is worst. Last flight they left my luggage in Dubai. This time flight delayed by more than 12 hours and the worst part is no one is there to address the customers, the staff are hiding somewhere in the airport. Try to avoid them as much as you can. They should be the last option. Prefer a bus over them.

### "Yet another day in SpiceJet glory"
Yet another day in SpiceJet glory. My flight gets cancelled precisely 24 hours before (They haven't heard of advanced communication). Note I have a connecting flight the next day from Bangalore to London. Now in a panic, I try every single number for customer care only to be dis-connected saying we are busy (they haven't heard of a call queue). Finally, I scanned through the cancellation message a mail and it reads - you can get a refund or reschedule. I thought maybe they had automated everything and I would be able to book something on the same day if I follow the link - surprise surprise they take me for a complete fool (and for that reason every single customer). After you follow their interface it says your money will be refunded in 21 days and there is no option for fight change. I want my money right now in 1 day in fact in 5 minutes the way you looted it while SpiceJet looted it while they gave an illusion for a service. I wonder why the Indian aviation authorities and customer services are not looking in such malpractices.

### "The worst flight I have flown with"
The worst flight I have flown with, airline has no sense of responsibility towards their customer satisfaction and they don’t value their time. I have taken a return trip flight with SpiceJet and both the times the flight was delayed by more than 4 hours. No communication was sent by the airline. When I asked one of assistant boarding staff to give the email ID of their supervisor, she clearly said that she don’t know the ID and during the flight the cabin crew were not co-operative. SpiceJet is very frequent in news for their delays and flight issues, still no actions are taken from their side. I think the Managing Director and his team should look into this or else SpiceJet should restrict their business to India and close their international flights.

### "Spicejet flights are delayed."
Always delayed due to technical issues. I wonder why only Spicejet flights are delayed. Its has become a habit for such airlines to operate without bothering customer service and satisfaction.

### "SpiceJet calls me a day prior to inform the flight is cancelled"
I had my flight booked for 1st October from Goa to Hyderabad. The flight time being around an hour. SpiceJet calls me a day prior to inform the flight is cancelled and I have to take an alternate flight (Goa - Delhi) (Delhi - Hyderabad) the flight time including lay over is more than 10 hours. I am travelling with 2 kids. Very very bad. Don’t prefer SpiceJet.

### "doesn’t care about customer satisfaction"
It is a shame that companies like this are still allowed to operate. The flight was announced with delay and there is nothing you can do. They mention to you one hour delay so that you don’t freak out but at the end you don’t know when you are flying. On top of that you as very rude staff that really doesn’t care about customer satisfaction. If you ask to be booked on an earlier flight even with another airline they laugh at you. Never again and I advise all visitors to India to avoid them. They lie to you with a smile and they keep you sitting on the side until you break up

### "gave me such a bad experience"
I travelled in August. Firstly the temperature inside the flight was not good. Sometimes they were increasing the temperature so much that I felt suffocation at times. Sometimes it became so cold inside. Secondly on landing we were inside for about 30 minutes because they did not pen the door. Overall a 3 hour flight gave me such a bad experience. Never travel through spicejet.

### "a very satisfying experience"
Very smooth flying experience. Both on ground staff and inflight crew seemed capable, efficient, friendly and pleasantly helpful. The quality of service was excellent. The toilet was clean. The meal provided was fresh. No hassle and no delays at any point before, during or after the flight. I did not have to wait more than a couple minutes for my luggage after landing. Overall, I had a very satisfying experience.

### "I was forced to pay extra for 3 kg"
Not Verified |  Yesterday I travelled in SpiceJet flight sg8391 from Patna to Delhi with Infant. Two days before boarding the flight I contacted SpiceJet customer care to ask about luggage. Allowed weight for infant because it was not mentioned in the ticket. SpiceJet is basically playing with their terms and conditions and incorrectly charging the customer. I was told to go to the link https://corporate.spicejet.com/tnc.aspx point number 14 where it says that passenger travelling with infant are allowed to query 7 kg extra but the lady on the boarding counter clearly that the terms and condition of SpiceJet has been updated and their customer care is not aware about it. The terms and condition now is that mother travelling alone will be allowed 7 kg extra. It seems but they are making their own policy standing on the counter and she told me if I don't pay this amount she will put my luggage back outside the counter. I was forced to pay extra for 3 kg although I was in weight limits what was told to me by customer care of SpiceJet and whatever it was told to me on the board accountable was completely incorrect and not mentioned anywhere in the terms and condition of SpiceJet. It seems that the employees of SpiceJet just play with the customers by making their own terms and conditions on basis of their assumptions. The manager of of boarding counter was very rude she was not even interested to speak to us. They clearly said that if I am paying money extra for just take the luggage away from here.

### "fare was very low"
I paid 1,400 INR extra to upgrade to priority premium at the check in counter. For the equivalent of 20 USD I got a sandwich, an OK instant coffee and the pleasure of boarding first and sitting in the first row (the seat was a standard seat). The flight left on time and the cabin crew were friendly. The fare was very low so no complaints.

### "no support to file my claim"
A 2 hour direct flight changed to 10 hour break journey and no support provided. I was travelling with my senior citizen mother and was quite troubled to rebook another flight after my flight has to be cancelled. Also no support to file my claim, for which i have insurance and i just needed 'no show confirmation' from airlines, but they never provided, only excuses

### "SpiceJet refused to board us"
As we arrived at the gate on time for our Dubai - Mumbai flight, SpiceJet refused to board us for no apparent reason. I deduce that this company practices overbooking. Not happy to have made us miss this flight, this action has simply deprived us of holidays, my family and I, since we also missed our 2nd connection for Thailand and by the same, the organized trip that we had planned and paid for . All because of the SpiceJet representative in Dubai. Shame on him and this unprofessional company  Alors que nous sommes arrivés à la porte d’embarquement à l’heure pour notre vol Dubai - Mumbai, SpiceJet a refusé de nous embarquer sans raison apparente. J’en déduis que cette compagnie pratique le surbooking. Non content de nous avoir fait loupé ce vol, cet agissement vient simplement de nous priver de vacances, ma famille et moi, puisque nous avons aussi raté notre 2eme correspondance pour la Thailande et par la même, le voyage organisé que nous avions prévu et payé. Tout ça à cause du représentant de SpiceJet à Dubai. Honte à lui et à cette compagnie peu professionnelle

### "my flight has been cancelled"
I booked a flight one month prior to my departure. Four days before the actual commencement date i get to know that my flight has been cancelled and Rescheduled for the next day. When i called the customer helpline they refused to provide me any help other than refunding the amount or scheduling the flight for the next day. When i asked them to transfer my ticket to the nearby airport they even refused to do that. They were asking to pay the balance amount for the other flights even though when the fault was from their side.

### "Below average flight"
Below average flight. Recently I travelled in SpiceJet on 06/July/2022. I have travelled twice with this SpiceJet but I made a mistake giving this airline a second chance. Every time SpiceJet flight is 40-50 min late so as to avoid the 60 min mark so as to evade any penalty. After deboarding, the luggage took forever to come and due to it (delayed flight+ delayed luggage) I missed my connecting train for which I had paid a hefty amount in tatkaal tickets. It's mandatary to pay and choose a seat before web-check in.

### "the worst flying experience"
Not Verified |  This is the worst flying experience I ever had with this Spicejet. Rude staff, worst Flight, they do not provide food. I paid 18000 rupees to travel from Hyderabad to Kishangarh. Overall I recommend no one to choose this flight.

### "each time the flight is delayed"
Most pathetic airline. I was travelling 2nd time and each time the flight is delayed. No help and support for delayed on airport. We were just waiting for hours to depart on the flight.

### "SpiceJet turned out to be the nightmare"
I booked my flight tickets with this airline and that decision to choose SpiceJet turned out to be the nightmare! First and foremost, the airline added a stop (Jabalpur) at the last moment without seeking any consent from the traveller. I booked my flight for 8th June 2022, non-stop from Mumbai to Chennai. Had to postpone my journey as my wife is pregnant and she couldn’t take a 5 hours since SpiceJet added a stop thereby routing my journey from Mumbai to Jabalpur to Chennai and making a 2 hours direct journey to a 5 hours journey. Left with no other option, I had to shift my journey date to 9th June. Reached airport and there started another another round of drama. Ill mannered, rude and arrogant ground staff at the counter made me stand for 30 mins and then she finally came up with a form which stated that if any things goes wrong with my pregnant wife’s health, the airline will not be responsible for anything including any expense incurred in health. Me, my wife and my 3 year old son- we all were allotted a different seat numbers. Even after requesting multiple time, that lady refused to give us sequential seating arrangement. At last, I had to request my fellow passengers to change the seats (they were kind enough to accept my request). Highly unprofessional, rude and arrogant cabin crew. I am a frequent traveler but I haven’t faced such incident in my past.

### "There is absolutely no empathy for the customer"
SpiceJet has horrible service and reschedules the flight without thinking about the convenience of its customers. I had booked an early morning direct flight from Hyderabad to Delhi which takes about 2.5/3 hours as I had whole day program in Jabalpur. It rerouted the flight through Delhi with a stopover at Delhi for 8 hours making me miss the whole of the day program. Now a couple of hours before the flight time which was to start at 5 pm, it has further delayed the flight by 5 hours making me miss the evening program also. This has happened with Delhi to Jabalpur flight in January 2019 as well when they postponed the flight by 7 hours. Why would anyone book a early morning unless one has some work during the day. SpiceJet has ruined the whole program I had, morning as well as evening, not only at Jabalpur but also at my base location because I had not planned any work due to upcoming travel. There is absolutely no empathy for the customer. They should have tried to book the passengers in other flights or planned something else.

### "Very bad experience"
Very bad experience with SpiceJet today. No water provided to the passengers, AC was not working  and it was very hot. Even after landing the plane crews and captain left the plane they were not present to listen the complains also.

### "I want to praise the services"
I want to praise the services offered by SpiceJet and praise the cabin crew staff on the flight. The entire staff team was so helpful, and nature was so humble. The attentiveness and politeness were thoroughly professional. I highly appreciate your staff and their professional behavior.

### "There was utter confusion and no clarity"
SG 953 on 19/5/2022 Delhi Terminal 1 to Shirdi International Terminal. The flight was scheduled to land at Shirdi at 4.50pm. Instead, the flight landed at Mumbai at 5.30pm. Announcement was made just before landing at Mumbai. Reason given was storm at Shirdi when actually there was no storm and 3 different flights from Chennai, Tirupati and Vizag (including one ATR) landed around the same time. This was confirmed from local authority at Shirdi. Passengers were in the aircraft for more than 3 hours in Mumbai, during this period there were only 2 announcements, 1st announcement after 1 hour of landing in Mumbai that flight will be taken to Nashik as it could not land in Shirdi after dark. 2nd announcement after 3.5 hours was that passengers were given 3 options: Option 1: stay at Mumbai for the night and go to Shirdi next day. Option 2: Go to Shirdi by bus. Option 3: Go back to Delhi and fly to Shirdi next day. There was utter confusion and no clarity. Passengers lost their patience and naturally got furious. We were deboarded in Mumbai airport around 9.00pm. It took one hour to collect the checked-in luggage as different ground crew announced different conveyor belt Nos (No 1,4,14 and finally 13). Ground staff signed and put stamp on the boarding pass of the passengers after writing full refund of the to ticket charges. On requesting for refund through mail, SpiceJet authorities refuse to refund citing the reason for rescheduling of flight (mail from SpiceJet attached). This is totally misleading information and mismanagement by SpiceJet treating their customers as fools and commodity. SMS/Mail from SpiceJet was about cancellation of the flight which was not correct. The loss of time, mental stress, fatigue and poor communication and misinformation by the Pilot can not be compensated in terms of money. I had already blacklisted SpiceJet earlier because of their poor service.. No wonder SpiceJet is on the verge of collapse and shutting down looking at their quality of staff, meals, aircraft and service. A complete failure of structure, process and outcome indicators.

### "Worst experience"
I have booked flight from Mumbai to Kanpur and after checking they call me that your flight is delayed 4 hrs. Staff also not helpful, they just say take your refund and take flight for another day. This is what SpiceJet do. Worst experience, will never travel with this flight

### "Spicejet couldn't care less"
Pathetic service. The ETA was 11:50 a.m. and at 13:55 p.m., the flight is yet to take off. Apparently the systems have had a ransomware attack, which is why they couldn't take off on time. My recent experience with SpiceJet in the last few months have all been delayed. While I waited with the other passengers at the boarding gate, multiple Indigo flights left. Spicejet couldn't care less.

### "Worst experience every time"
Worst experience every time. No time sense. Keeps getting delayed or cancelled. Not recommended. Staff, very rude and irresponsible. Do not help you out when the mistake is on their side.

### "worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Spicejet has worst customer service anyone can imagine. I made an advance booking for May 29 2022, but eventually had to get cancelled due to medical reasons. They asked me to forward documents and said they would waive off charges. Eventually the only solution they could offer me was an E voucher that too valid for 180 days. I kept requesting them if not refund then at least give me validity extension cause I won't be able to travel for another 10 months. But all request and mails to higher departments had no effect on them. They stuck to same solutions. I would urge people not to book in advance with them as they have the most stringent rules for the passengers.

### "Beware of taking this airline"
At the time of writing this, the 6.40 am flight is yet to depart and the ETD is given as 15.00 hrs. Delhi has no bad weather, yet the reason given is bad weather. One of the worst airlines to travel. Beware of taking this airline.

### "delayed both ways by many hours"
Not Verified |  Flight was delayed both ways by many hours. Poor service for the same price as other airlines like IndiGo. No wifi or other amenities to compensate for terrible service.

### "Avoid this flight"
I travelled with same carry on with indigo and had no issues but SpiceJet charged me 3000 Rs. Almost 100% of ticket price. I am never taking this flight. The guy at the Jaipur counter  did not listen to my explanation. Avoid this flight. Unless you want to get surprised by extra cost.

### "Staff members are well mannered"
Very good service and I always prefer SpiceJet. Staff members are well mannered and service is very prompt. Time is also being maintained and reaching the destination on time.

### "Very disappointed with SpiceJet"
Its a Low cost carrier but that does not mean you literally stuff your passenger inside the aircraft. There was no leg space. We (me and my wife) had to sit for 2 hours in the same position. On top of this, we were assigned the last seat (36th row) and the seats weren’t recliner. No space behind. Buses provide best and comfortable seats these days. Very disappointed with SpiceJet. I wish I never get to travel with this carrier in my future.

### "extremely disappointed with the experience"
Not Verified |  I am extremely disappointed with the experience I am having with SpiceJet. First the flight was rescheduled 5 times between yesterday and today morning. It started at 8:15 am from Dubai instead of 22:40 PM yesterday. Wait time at airport was extremely long for the flight to take off. To my surprise I did not receive my bag at the airport for such a short flight and no transit in between I have an important function to attend tomorrow and there is perishable stuff in the suitcase. SpiceJet service and handling has spoiled my entire trip and left me in very difficult situation. I just called their customer care number. Wait time was close to 1 hour for an agent to pick and there was no definite response when my luggage will be loaded and when I will receive. Looks like airlines support staff is clueless.

### "Unable to get my baggage from the flight"
Not Verified |  Unable to get my baggage from the flight. It’s been 3 days and I have no updates on what is happening. No one is picking the call and if someone picks they don’t have any information on what’s happening. Such a ridiculous service and pathetic customer care. How can they be such irresponsible towards their work.

### "Good service and support"
Good service and support received from ground and air crew for my ailing mother’s travel. Even doctor was made available at landing airport without asking.

### "A good experience"
A good experience with Spicejet. Its a LCC so not to expect much, but on time arrival, clean aircraft and was as per expectation, Have a wifi enabled IFE system which can be used in personal mobile/tab/laptop devices.

### "never had such a bad experience"
I have never had such a bad experience with any Airline. I am a 6 month pregnant woman and on 10nd April their staff was just utterly ignorant. Me and my husband were trying to check in our luggage, my husband was in longer queue and I stood on the new counter, the lady who was checking in told me that I should wait while other guys check in, I am not in a condition to stand for long so I told her I am pregnant and first in queue, she made weird faces and tried to ignore that's where my husband had to intervene. There were no courtesy whatsoever. Second, while we were on flight, the hostess didn't give me any instruction even though I told her I was pregnant. I paid for the food and beverage for both me and my husband, and our name wasn't there on the list, there was a long hassle to prove that we paid for the same. Although the Airhostess offered us the same later but proving that you have paid wasn't really a 5* experience.

### "fabulous experience we had"
My wife and I travelled on 18 March Goa to Mumbai on SG 476. We were surprised at their super service and fabulous experience we had. The flight was earlier than the original schedule, check in staff at Goa desk were excellent and professional. On board the flight attendants were super, courteous and helpful. Upon request our seats were also adjusted to the front row of the aircraft. Special shout out to the flight hostess- Manjali who was awesome. We wish Spice Jet all the best.

### "Experienced excellent customer service"
I am a frequent flyer and normally find service on a flight average. But, this time to my surprise the service on this flight was excellent. The crew was ensuring each ones comfort and the feeling having a "Truly Happy to serve" vibes were there. It was more than just a duty. It was genuine. Experienced excellent customer service after a long time.

### "Staff were courteous"
Flown on this route yesterday SpiceJet is a LCC so expectation was not so high and overall experience was good. Check in at airport was not needed as I was travelling with only hand baggage so web checking soft copy was ok to travel. Boarding started on time and also took off before time. Cabin was ok, legroom was ok wrt LCC, not too cramped, looks fresh and clean. They also offers complimentary IFE through WIFI, can be used on personal mobile/tab/laptop. Staff were courteous, reached Darbhanga on time. Overall good experience wrt a LCC.

### "cabin crew were professional"
I was delighted to fly with SpiceJet as my recent experience with them was fantastic. The cabin crew were professional and kept their cool throughout the journey. Their hospitality was commendable.

### "The worst experience ever"
The worst experience ever. These guys know how to loot the money from customers. Never in my life have I paid for my laptop bag. And they charge for duty free weight. The ticket was of 6k inr and they charge me 5k for my laptop bag which was only 5kg. And the worst part is they ask for money at the last spot where we have to board the flight. So that the passenger is not left with any other option.

### "hospitality service given"
Seats are comparable if compare to other budget airlines. Cabin crews are friendly and hospitality service given with smiles. Very happy and enjoy experience.

### "Thank you so much for your support and cooperation SpiceJet"
SpiceJet has one of the best customer care executives. I had to catch a plane from Goa to New Delhi. However, by mistake I booked my flight from New Delhi to Goa. I had lost all my hopes of retrieving my money but their employee helped me greatly. Even though it was a commercial line, she kept guiding me for around 40 minutes. Not only did she help me save around Rs. 17,000, she advised me step by step throughout the call on how to carry out the process. I'm deeply indebted to her from the bottom of my heart and really congratulate them for having such a caring and helpful agent. Thank you so much for your support and cooperation SpiceJet.

### "won’t recommend to anyone"
The worst flight I have ever experienced. They count your luggage at per person instead of weight. No service at all. The crew doesn’t provide proper snacks if you pay for it at time of booking the flight. At the time of snacks they gives you 2 biscuits and a 10 rupees juice. When we demanded tea or coffee they make lame excuses. They charge extra for luggage without checking their weight. Worst flight ever. I am not travelling Spicejet ever again and won’t recommend to anyone.

### "Horrible experience and wouldn’t recommend"
Not Verified |  The worst international flight experience! We paid for priority check in and Spice Max but we literally had to beg for all the services we were entitled to, in fact their staff asked us to get into the regular queues and wait saying there are no priority services, we literally had to fight for it. Also this airline makes you pay extra for what you shop from duty free! They weigh your cabin baggage again after check in before you enter the flight and ask you to pay. Horrible experience and wouldn’t recommend it to anyone!

### "literally the worst situation"
Not Verified | I had a flight scheduled on 8th Jan' 22 from Mum to Sri (SG 944). Due to bad weather conditions in Srinagar, the flight got cancelled which is understandable. The flight was almost full. So instead of getting us on another flight the next day, they told us that all the direct flights for the next day are cancelled and are also full for the upcoming 3 days. They are then providing us indirect flight via Delhi after 2 days. I am still following up with my accomodation issues in Kashmir for change in dates and not sure if i will get a refund for my hotel bookings. Also, they are not adjusting us for direct flights and i have to additionally budget my stay option in Delhi for one night as well. How can an airline be so ignorant to the travellers since we are the reason you guys have business. My cancelled flight was almost full, and they could have simply scheduled another flight for the next day. But they are now giving us indirect flights at the charge of direct flights which is generally higher. The staff was lying to the crowd that the direct flights are cancelled and giving us indirect flights. And at the same time, they were taking a few passengers to the side and booking them on direct flights. I was one of them but they later told me that the direct flight just got fully booked but don't tell the rest of the passengers that the flights are operating. This is literally the worst situation any airline has put me through.

### "worst flight I have ever seen"
One of the worst flight I have ever seen. This service is very bad. I traveled 3rd time in this flight with SpiceJet. Every time flight is late and having bad experience. Consider this the choose another flight

### "Worst staff and not at all concerned"
Not Verified |  Worst staff and not at all concerned. I had travelled all the way from Solapur to Mumbai to catch my early morning flight to Jabalpur and after standing there in the check-in line for 2 hours they say your flight has been rescheduled to the evening after 12 hours and no communication was made to me for this rescheduling. In fact I was getting upgrading and priority services messages but no message for flight been delayed. The staff at Mumbai airport didn't even bother to convey this very well. Pathetic airline. I wouldn't suggest it to anyone.

### "Too many flight delays, cancellations"
Not Verified |  Flight SG3024. The flight was scheduled to start at 3.15 pm. They preponed it to 3 pm. They have this weird rule that you have to web check in 1 hour before the flight and they don't have the facility to check in physically at the terminal. My father-in law who was the passenger who was returning from Pune to Hyderabad was a senior citizen and was returning back after attending the death ritual of a relative had a harrowing time with arrogant staff who were not willing to help him. They said they will refund the airfare but fingers crossed. Show me the money and then I will believe. Some thing is wrong with SpiceJet. Lots of problems. Too many flight delays, cancellations. We should avoid this Airline.

### "get back to you within 3 working days"
We wanted web check-in. On app as well as website we couldn't make it. All numbers given on ticket were switched off. I had to rush to Rajkot airport to have a 'web' check-in! I sought on mail information on RTPCR test. The auto-reply said 'Will get back to you within 3 working days'. Who waits for three days to get an answer to such small issue? The airline staff of Bagdogra also badly handled my bag and broke the belts and wheels out of one bag.

### "trick to lure their customers to prepay"
Not Verified |  On the Spicejet site, while booking a flight, on the payment page it gave an offer for the gift card where I will not be charged a convenience fee and will get priority services. I bought the gift card from their site, and while applying it is showing transaction error. After contacting them, they said it will take 3 working days to resolve the issue. It's been more than 10days now, they have not taken any action, flight rates are now sky high and they are not even ready to refund the gift card amount. This is a trick to lure their customers to prepay for the gift card and then not let them use it so that after a certain period of time they can charge them more for the same trip.

### "my Ticket gone to waste"
I was landing Bangalore Airport at 5:20 AM and I have booked domestic ticket from Bangalore to Managalore Morning at 07:50. Now Spicejet preponed the time to 6:55 for some reason only 55 minutes because if they prepone 1 or over 1 hr then they have to give full refund. Now my Ticket gone to waste even after booking flexi fare. I will never going to travel with Spicejet in future.

### "Wonderful flight"
Wonderful flight, excellent cabin crew and cooperative ground staff. Service with a smile seems to be the mantra here with everyone. I always fly SpiceJet.

### "Affordable and good service"
Flight attendants and ground staff were really courteous and very attentive. The flight was small ATR but the service was 5/5. Affordable and good service.

### "in-flight experience was good"
The in-flight experience was good, even though the WiFi didn't work so there was no streaming entertainment. But the cabin crew were helpful and the food I purchased onboard was also of good quality. Once I arrived at the airport and began boarding, everything went well. But the trouble is that my original booking was of a 4-5 hour journey duration, but the airline changed the route and connection, so today I am travelling for more than 8 hours, which is a lot for a domestic flight. Also, there were several revisions of route and time before the actual journey, which got me rather stressed.

### "Very bad handling by the ground staff of SpiceJet"
The flight was delayed by over 2 hours and was rescheduled to 11.15 am. As per notification, we (including other passengers) were at Gate # 21. At the last moment (around 11.00 am) the ground staff came and informed us that the Gate was changed to 106. When we reached Gate # 106, we were informed that the Gate was closed and boarding can not be allowed. On argument, we were allowed boarding. The ground staff were abusive saying "Are you illiterate? and "I am doing Ehshaan (favour) by allowing you all to board". I have never experienced such issue any time in the past. Very bad handling by the ground staff of SpiceJet.

### "excellent experience"
Not Verified | Jaipur to Kolkata via Guwahati. It was an excellent experience. Flight crew were very supportive and inflight service was excellent.

### "crew was so warm and professional"
My journey was them was just amazing. The crew was so warm and professional, they went ahead to help customers to the best of their availability.

### "not issued refund on time"
Flight service is not for the family passengers. They cancelled my flight on 4th September and have not issued refund on time. We have to send a lot of mails for the refund and will not get proper reply. Better to avoid this flight.

### "I'm still following up for a refund"
Not Verified |  My ticket was booked with SpiceJet for 21st Aug 2021. Three days before I get a message that the flight is cancelled due to "Operational Issues". I called and asked for a refund and I was told that a refund has been initiated and it will be credited within 10 working days. Cut to present date - 19-9-2021, I'm still following up for a refund.

### "experience was very satisfactory"
In-flight experience was very satisfactory. Cabin crew was very courteous, and the seats were clean. The flight arrived at the destination before time and the exit process via aero-bridge was much better than that of using a mobile staircase followed by bus to the terminus. I'm happy with my journey by SpiceJet.

### "after 26 days the refund is not received"
I had booked 3 tickets for myself and my family by SG-282 dated 24-Aug-2021 from MUM-COK. SpiceJet cancelled the Flight. I cancelled my tickets on 22-Aug-2021 when received the Flight cancellation message and opted for full refund. Even after 26 days, I have not got the refund. The customer care initially told that it will take 15 days to get the refund. 15 days withholding the money for cancelling the Flight for their own benefit (other 2 airlines were operating on the same day, same route, same timing) shows their commitment to the customers. The worst part is even after 15 days no refund received. Even after 26 days the refund is not received.

### "The team members were excellent and courteous"
We would like to share my positive experience while travelling with SpiceJet SG3702 on 17 September 2021 from Goa to Rajkot with my wife and my two year old princess. The service received from the cabin crew was exemplary. The team members were excellent and courteous. The service provided was of a very high standard and should be an example for other crew members. It’s good service, everything was neat and clean with safety.

### "causing delay of 3 hours 30 min"
Every single time I have traveled with SpiceJet there was either delay in flight or flight was cancelled or rescheduled. Today also my flight was re scheduled first causing delay of 3 hours 30 min to reach destination and then there was again delay of 30 mins for the re scheduled flight. On top of it I was told that as I am having connecting flight (Ajmer to Delhi and then from Delhi to Bengaluru , but both of spice Jet) I have to collect my baggage at Delhi and again re check in. Reason told was server issue, but other flight operator at same airport didn't had the issue. Won't recommend anyone in future to take SpiceJet flight.

### "worst experience with Spicejet"
Not Verified |  We booked a direct flight with Spicejet from Chennai to Goa (12th September) one month ahead and made all the reservations for car, resorts, etc. On 10th September, received a call saying our direct flight has been cancelled and we are asked to travel with 1 stop. So Chennai to Mumbai and Mumbai to Goa. The waiting time in Mumbai is 6+ hours. I wrote to customer relations, asking them, since there is no alternate flights available, its our daughters first birthday and she was so nagging and I requested them atleast provide a lounge or room considering the infant as it is 6+ hours. I got no response for that until 12th September. When you call customer care, one have to nearly wait 40+ minutes to speak to respective person in-charge. Again, via return, the direct flight has been cancelled. We took a flight from Goa to Bangalore and Bangalore to Chennai with 3+ hours waiting time in Bangalore. There was a time change again, from Goa to Bangalore and we re-booked our cab. We had a very worst experience with Spicejet. All they say, the change is due to operational reasons. In a single PNR, 3 changes are acceptable? Citizens, please think before you travel with Spicejet that too when you have an infant.

### "It was a superb experience"
Not Verified |  Bhavnagar to Surat. It was a superb experience, as I was travelling with an infant they gave us their full support. On the ground crew and the inflight crew both were helpful. Easy check in.

### "ground staff was so rude"
I was having flight from Bangalore to Darbhanga and I fly from your SpiceJet continuously but this time I had a really really bad experience with u guys. My luggage was overweight and I was ready to pay for that but ground staff was so rude. I just paid 4500 extra for my luggage but they should have manners. I will never ever fly from your spicejet it was really the worst experience.

### "inflight entertainment is very poor"
The inflight entertainment is very poor, so I think SpiceJet can improve this service fast. Overall the cabin crew are very good, however I don't like the entertainment.

### "It was an extraordinary experience with the crew"
It was an extraordinary experience with the crew. Very humane. I am diabetic and 62yrs old. I had taken my medicine with the expectation that food and beverages would be available during the flight, but I was told that as per DGCA rules, no food is sold if the flight duration is less than two hours. But the crew helped me with sugar water, otherwise I would have gone into hypoglycemia. Thanks to crew. But with this I request DGCA to permit at least beverages during any flight which can be needed in an emergency by any passenger, be it child or adult. I am highly obliged to the crew.

### "Seats are not comfortable"
The last few flights the on time arrival is 100%. Cabin crew is cooperative and addresses the passenger needs. Seats are not comfortable and inadequate leg space. Airline has adequate airline menu but pre booking is costlier than on board purchase. Onboard purchase is limited to availability of items. On ground Passenger management is satisfactory at Metro cities but it is unsatisfactory at smaller airports like Darbhanga.

### "unpleasant service by airport staff"
Despite boarding pass being issued at start of journey, the onward flight at Delhi took off leaving us stranded in Delhi . No information at the time of deboarding. We are running all over Delhi T3 catching hold of random Spicejet employees and seeking help. How could they leave without passengers who were already issued boarding pass? Why did they not assign somebody to take care of us when we alighted in transit at Delhi T3. Worst is that they kept offering refund to passengers who are in transit. Finally they put us on the next days flight which again we had to insist upon. Harrowing journey and unpleasant service by airport staff of Spicejet at Delhi T3.

### "Never ever faced this with any other airlines"
Thousand and one times Spicejet simply revised the flight timings. Also the layover time got extended to 19 hours instead of 11 hours, which previously was a layover of 2.5 hours. I would never recommend SpiceJet to anyone. They simply harassed me like anything. I am sitting in Mumbai airport with no lounge access as they won't allow me to enter arrivals, have to wait throughout the night because of their so called "operational reasons". Never ever faced this with any other airlines. This is the 3rd time I am facing issues with SpiceJet.

### "enjoyed flying with Spicejet"
I would request you to speak little slowly while briefing instructions, it was too fast. Everything is chargeable like printing boarding pass, seats of your choice etc. Overall enjoyed flying with Spicejet.

### "won’t recommend it to anyone"
Flight schedule departure from Gwalior was 9:35 AM and 12:50 PM was arrival at Bangalore. And in actual the takeoff happened at 12:50 PM and arrival at Bangalore happened at 4:15 PM! Worst part is : I reached airport at 8 AM and at 8:15 I received a notification that the time changed to 10:15 I waited for an hour and then I receive a notification that the time changes to 10:35 After 30 minutes of more wait I get notification that time changes to 11:35 And then finally after one hour I receive a notification that the updated time is 12:05 PM. SpiceJet team is so unprofessional that they kept on changing time within an hours difference and this happened 4 times for the same flight. I won’t recommend it to anyone because they don’t really know what’s happening and how their actions could impact passengers schedule

### "preponed my flight by 12 hours"
Not Verified |  I have booked my direct flight to Delhi from Guwahati in evening. But don't know why these guys at SpiceJet preponed my flight by 12 hours and scheduled in morning 5:30 from evening 6. Not only this as a replacement these guys are giving a connecting flight via Patna as per there own convenience. This pathetic service is not acceptable at all.

### "flight could be more spacious"
The flight could be more spacious. Flight had too much noise in the cabin while flying. Branding could be done on water bottles and apart from them can at least provide basic PPE like mask and Sanitizers.

### "amazing experience"
Pune to Patna. I had an amazing experience with the crew members on flight. All the crew members were extremely proactive in assisting passenger and were highly professional.

### "cabin crew were very friendly and helpful"
It was a great journey and experience flying with Spicejet. The cabin crew were very friendly and helpful. I also appreciate the before time arrival of the flight at the destinations, although there was a delay in departure from Jammu. Hope to travel soon again!

### "weighing laptop bag and ladies bag"
Staff is troubling the customers by weighing laptop bag and ladies bag in cabin luggage and charging for over and above 7 kgs @ Rs.500 per kg. It was not only me who have paid for 3 kgs, there were many other customers who were paying even for 1 kg extra. This is so ridiculous. Services of Vistara and Air India is much better than spicejet.

### "really disappointed"
I was travelling with my family from Jabalpur to Mumbai, after seated in a flight one and half hours they canceled the flight and I have to catch the International flight from Mumbai to Doha on 2nd Aug 2021. What SpiceJet did, they gave me another ticket on behalf of canceled flight, of 1st August 2021 from Jabalpur to Pune and they promised we will arrange transport from Pune to Mumbai International Airport, but I didn’t receive any transport and wasted 2 hours at Pune Airport and they didn’t do any arrangements for me and my family, since I have to catch International flight due to this I did my own arrangement from Pune to Mumbai travel. This is really disappointed for me and my family.

### "They appear completely incompetent"
Tried to organise a business trip to Chennai last week. Had to move to this week, amending my entire schedule because SpiceJet unilaterally decided I didn't need to be in Chennai that day/week and just told me I was going when they could make it happen. Rescheduled my trip for this week, rearranged by booking and now they have amended once and cancelled once. Suggest that anyone that needs to work to a schedule should give this lot a wide berth. They appear completely incompetent.

### "right service in providing snacks"
Air hostess has done wonderful efforts by providing right service in providing snacks at appropriate time. The options she had provided is wonderful and appreciable. Kudos to spicejet for such crew member.

### "will never recommend using Spicejet"
Flight no SG 122. I wish there would have 0 star rating to give because they don't even deserve 1 star. They changed our flight timings at first due to which we had to change our other events timimg. Later on airport our baggage was not loaded. We had to wait 2 to 3 days to have our baggage. They were not even sorry for the same and the airport staff was very rude to help us in that situation. As a part of compensation they promised us 1500 voucher written on the attachment top. But still not received it. Even after several calls and emails they are not replying anything on the voucher status.. Not answering the calls either. Dont know why they charge so much money for such a worst service. I will never recommend using Spicejet ever to anyone. I had a worst experience ever with the airport staff. And due to no great response from customer service i believe this airlines is not a price worthy. Better use other airlines than spicejet.

### "an unethical airline"
Spicejet are an unethical airline. They cancelled our flight in March 2020 and promised a full refund. More than 15 months later we are still waiting for that refund. SpiceJet's charter states refunds are issued within 7 days if purchased tickets by credit card. The Supreme Court of India ruled that Spicejet must pay out refunds by 31st March 2021. SpiceJet are in in serious breach of contact and legal ruling. For the last 15 months we have been in contact with SpiceJet's consumer relations, nodal officer and appellate.

### "response in this manner was totally abnormal"
After reaching airport we came to know that the flight has been cancelled/rescheduled to 28th, no prior information(email or message) about their changes, received the message only on 26th 10am that to after reached airport. Asked to refund to take alternate flight and asked who will pay for stay and food, They refused to refund the ticket amount, they suggest to cancel the ticket but told cancellation charge will applicable. See they want to do cancellation charge for the flight which was cancelled, flight which was not in schedule. After long fight alternate flight was given from Delhi, on next day 27th. Their response in this manner was totally abnormal.

### "I had to spent an entire night at the airport"
Not Verified |  SpiceJet is the most pathetic airline service out of all available services in India. They can cancel the reservation at any moment of time and will leave you hanging. Happened with me twice, being a solo female traveller I had to spent an entire night at the airport because they cancelled the flight. This happened again today. Just don't go for SpiceJet if you have any other options available.

### "staff is very unprofessional and arrogant"
Their ground staff is very unprofessional and arrogant. I observed that hand baggage weight limit policy of 7kg is applied to only certain customers. I have been waiting in the que for boarding and in front of me many customers gone with higher weight and in my turn I had 2 kg extra and I have been instructed to pay 60Dhs per kg for excess weight. I honour their terms and conditions but my question is that the policy should be uniform to all customers. I don’t understand the logic behind different terms according to the face value of customers. They are favouring some customers according to their wish and relaxed for more than 10kg. When I tried to ask this to their ground staff, they were so arrogant and impatient. They kicked me out from the que and rudely told if you don’t want to pay throw your item. I have been travelling in this sector for past 17 years and used many carriers. Never experienced such behavior earlier. When I entered the flight, again surprising that there is no space to keep my hand baggage. They have collected such a heavy amount and I had to keep that items below my seat compromising leg space. When I shared my experience to their customer service team later, they come up with copy paste of standard reply format justifying their terms. Be aware about their standard so that you will not have disappointment.

### "wish to fly with Spicejet again"
I traveled on 20th March 2021 from Mumbai to Delhi to Dharamshala. While I was outside the airport I was clueless on where to go due to the pandemic and was stressed about covid-19 and I asked a very friendly airport staff luckily it was your own airline Spicejet staff and he showed me the way and I met him at Spicejet counter and he greeted me with a big smile and helped me with the entire check-in process while another staff was doing the check-in and requested that staff to tagging my bag up till Dharamshala which made my trip at ease and also told me what all I need to do when I land in Delhi and also at Dharamshala. With regards to what I can carry and what I can't carry also guided me in check-in and hand luggage which made me really feel at ease as I was a single lady passenger and with the pandemic situation so I was scared and all. Apart from that I really loved him for his excellent communication skills, open-minded and friendliness, his professionalism, his passion for his work, excellent work ethic, courtesy, his manners, friendliness and open-minded attitude towards cultural awareness and he knows how to treat a passenger like a guest in his own home with respect without any discrimination unlike what I saw at Mumbai airport how poor people are treated. He also had put priority and transfer tag on my luggage so it gets loaded separately as promised by him, excited to see the bag come out 1st and that was very sweet of him. He is an excellent example of what customer service is. Though he didn't do my check in he has left a mark on me and he is the reason I wish to fly with Spicejet again and see more staff like him and his excellent habits

### "Masks should not be removed at any cost on flights"
Not Verified |  For a two hour flight food was served in this pandemic situation. People are removing their masks and happily eating was if there is no problem. This makes the situation very difficult during this covid situation we are dealing with. Masks should not be removed at any cost on flights when people are sitting next to each other. Please stop serving food in flight. And help everyone by doing this.

### "a very comfortable flight"
Not Verified |  Very friendly crew and a very comfortable flight. Felt at ease, got great sleep. One of the best flights in recent times. For a change the crew made us feel at home, unlike most flights where we can't wait to get over with the travel.

### "no guidance, very rude"
Horrible staff, no proper response, no guidance, very rude. I would rate 0 if I could for such a bad behaviour. One older guy who was traveling for the first time didn't had any knowledge what to do, not the staff was helpful.

### "it's about being unfair and rude"
Not Verified |  I am traveling from Jaipur to Mumbai. I had a small suitcase and a laptop bag. It was just 1 kg extra than the alloted hand baggage. I requested them to kindly allow as I am traveling at my parent's for the 1st time post marriage. I definitely was not asking for any favor but very rudely replied whether you going for the 1st time or last tome doesn't matter. He could have been more humble and said this is the policy. When I reached at the gate, I saw almost everyone with so much of luggage and I happened to ask a female who was carrying the same combination of hand luggage as mine. She said she did not pay for any extra luggage. It was visible that so many of the travellers were carrying more than one bag of hand luggage. It's not about money, it's about being unfair and rude.

### "No mask and face shield given"
I was travelling Goa to Pune with SpiceJet SG517 on 29th March. No mask and face shield was given. The person sitting in middle seat was not given PPE KIT. Not expected with Spicejet.

### "Spicejet staff made fool of me"
I made a webcheckin and paid for the selected seats but at checkin counter at Delhi Airport. Spicejet staff made fool of me said there is no booking by your name of the seats even I showed them my emobile boarding pass then also they remain arguing that we dont have these number at this flight which were selected and ask me to call customer care. And when I called at customer care they said ask at checkin counter, they were all just playing ping pong. At the end they provided me seats of their choice which were worst. And when I entered into the flight my web checkin seat number were there and someone else was sitting which I selected in web checkin.

### "I am so disappointed"
Not Verified |  I am so disappointed that I have been flying since years but never had this type of experience in my life. My baggage which I had mentioned as fragile was handled so badly that one of the wheels was missing and the bag was torn. When I complaint about that Spicejet didn't even felt sorry about that.

### "a value for money service"
We were onboard SG140 on 12th March 2021 (Kozhikode/Calicut - Dubai) and were delighted with our experience. We were so pleased with the Check-in support, timing of the flight, excellent Service by Cabin Crew and the Veg Complimentary Meal which came with Spice Max booking. We would recommend SpiceMax, which is a value for money service.

### "Crew members were courteous"
Not Verified |  Mumbai to Ranchi with SpiceJet. Crew members were courteous. Food quality was excellent during the journey. I recommend this airline.

### "Seat was not comfortable"
Cabin crew staff was excellent as well as ground staff. Wifi service was awesome. Seat was not comfortable and washroom was not cleaned. In food vegetarian sandwich was good but orange juice was bitter in taste.

### "the staff on board were very courteous"
Me and my husband flew from Jaisalmer to Ahmedabad. We had a wonderful experience and the staff on board were very courteous. Staff member went one extra mile preparing a sugar free tea which I wanted badly. The snacks we purchased on board were served well.

### "Special thanks to crew"
Excellent ground and on board service. On time performance. Special thanks to crew who make the journey comfortable.

### "The worst experience of my life"
The worst flight way I ever traveled on! It’s been 4 hours and I am still sitting at the airport, no one is here to guide us and provide the flight so that we could fly back! There’s no one helpful and just passing us here and there like pieces of luggage. We still don’t know where our bags actually are. Don’t book this flight ever! The worst experience of my life. I am still sitting here like a fool.

### "food and beverage menu is very good"
The food and beverage menu is very good and has decent options for everyone. The complementary inflight entertainment system which can be viewed on your personal device without any additional application needed is aN excellent addition to the inflight experience and when you realise it’s a low cost carrier it’s even better as no other low cost carrier in India is providing inflight entertainment options.

### "Service is impeccable"
Much better than airbus models. Even the basic economy class has ambient lighting. Better personal air vents and better spotlights. Even overhead storage bins are good. Service is impeccable with proper care taken of guests.

### "Best ever domestic flight experience"
Best ever domestic flight experience. Very helpful team, all the necessary preventive measures taken to keep safety of passengers from Covid 19. Best in domestic operators.

### "Perfect example of how a crew should be"
I have been flying with SpiceJet for a really long time but for the past few days it has been very frequent. On my last three journeys, coincidentally the cabin crew have been almost same. My journey from Delhi to Bangalore was nothing but a delight. The crew took care of not only me but each and every passenger following all the COVID norms. Special thanks for not only recognizing me but treating me specially as a valued customer. Proper behaviour, patience, and hospitality! Perfect example of how a crew should be. I know I am not any influential personality, but as someone who travels on a flight often and has health concerns while flying, the gesture from SpiceJet flight attendants compelled me to thank them and thank Spicejet for having such great employees.

### "I had a great experience"
I had a great experience. Flight was on time and flight executives were friendly. One of the flight hostesses was very good with her job, she helped my family. My mother was not well and she helped her with her diabetes so thank you for your experience.

### "The worst flight ever"
Not Verified |  The worst flight ever. Passengers are not even wearing masks & face shield and the attendants are not bothered. When asked they just replied saying cannot do anything about it. Top of that there is no PPE kit provided for the middle seat. But the air hostesses are wearing the kits. Does that mean passengers are not vulnerable to the virus but the staff are. Also, if you wanna do web check in for two people for two seat & keep it together, they are charging 800 bucks.

### "We enjoyed the journey"
Chennai to Guwahati. The staff was very friendly. We enjoyed the journey. They took care of us thoroughly. Although the food provided was not as per my taste, it was edible.

### "Crew members were very friendly and cheerful"
Crew members were very friendly and cheerful. Special mention for one who was very positive and in spite of few eatables not in stock he managed to convince passengers and arrange some alternatives and addressed everyone with their name. It was very personalized experience as remembering everyone name after going through the passenger list is really exceptional.

### "Stress-free Journey"
Stress-free Journey. Aircraft was very clean and had a tasty pre booked meal. But please add coffee. Cabin crew were up to mark and we landed before schedule arrival.

### "made the customers feel safe"
Crew members made the customers feel safe. I would specially mentioned that Ms. Samridhi was a great cabin crew. She arranged for coffee for me, was courteous and professional. The food that they served was well managed. The flight was delayed for almost 1 hour. Great work guys.

### "nothing is special on their flights"
I have travelled on many flights but SpiceJet was worst experience. They lack ethics, professionalism and most importantly they do not know how to talk to their customers. We were travelling from Goa to Mumbai and we arrived 50 mins prior to boarding and the queue was long, when our turn came they said we were late and they would not provide us with boarding passes. We pleaded with to them but their attitude was so rude. After pleading for 20 mins they gave us boarding passes because we had already done online check in. After all this drama I finally boarded the flight 15 mins early, if they haven’t made this an issue I would have boarded half an hour earlier. I really recommend to please learn hospitality from other airlines, I also travelled with Vistara, Indigo, GoAir and Air India, if their customers are late they actually look for you and make you board the flight without making it an issue. Then why not with SpiceJet, nothing is special on their flights. Timings of their flights are changing frequently without any prior information.

### "It is a very bad airline"
It is a very bad airline. I was going from chennai to port Blair on 26 Dec 2020. Before of it I had come from Delhi with spicejet flight. At Delhi airport, I had informed boarding staff that I am going to Port blair that time staff had permitted to go but at Chennai airport boarding staff stop me. They had not permitted me to go because I was not carrying RTPCR report. One day before at 1509 hrs on 25 Dec 2020 I got sms for RTPCR report. The result of RTPCR report take 24 hrs then how is it possible that I carry RTPCR report. And at Chennai airport boarding counter manager had told me that you will get full refund but now customer relation staff of Spicejet is not replying my mail also.

### "Good service and polite handling"
Good service and polite handling, felt comfortable. Was travelling from Riyadh to Trivandrum on SG9749, seated at 19d, crew were very helpful and excellent service by all. Thank you for good service.

### "shouting us not to touch his bags!"
I was travelling with my family Dammam - Calicut on 10 Dec 2020 by flight number SG9918 and we really enjoyed the trip during the full trip including the check in. However we would like to draw your attention to one of the bad incidents. Our seats were 3A and 3B and entered the flight almost at the end of the boarding process. We were trying to accommodate our hand baggage within the available space within the overhead compartment. In between one person occupying seat 1F started shouting us not to touch his bags! We were thinking that it is a crazy passenger but later on found from the crew that it is the captain of Spicejet. It was a shocking moment and we have never came across such an arrogant airline staff, whether national OR international carrier. We are not able to understand how can Spicejet afford such a bad person as your captain especially during this COVID season. We tried to complain to the crew but it was of no use since the captain is above all of them.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. I was travelling alone with my one year old daughter. I had planned to checkin my stroller and the hand luggages along with others since i was alone. I've done this with many other airlines in similar situations. However, today was a nightmare. Apparently i had to pay for checking in the above mentioned or carry them all with me. I was utterly shocked of the lady at the counter for behaving in such a rude way. She told me to open the stroller and take it back. So i had to carry the 7kg hand luggage of my baby, 7kg hand luggage of mine and my daughter with the stroller in my hand. And by the time I reached the plane i was truly exhausted. I had back ache and plane was hot. It had only paid food and the seating wasn't comfortable either. What is the point in paying for the infant if they don't have a seat, luggage allowance or food. The plane got delayed, I was starving and tired. And when I got off the plane the stroller wasn't there. I had to wait for the stroller after I've received all my suitcases. So what was the point in making me suffer if it all went in the same plane. Worst experience ever. Never choosing this airline ever again.

### "Delay due to bad weather"
Delay due to bad weather conditions. Flight was delayed by 2 hrs but attendant kept saying flight will depart in 5 mins. We were boarded into flight before time. With corona around we would have expected to have waited in airport, but here had to wait inside small aircraft

### "No word to explain how unsatisfied I am"
Not Verified |  I booked the ticket but yet to fly. This would be my first Travel in spicejet. But suddenly got a message that the ticket has been changed to next day. That means 24hrs delay. They given 2 contact numbers but when I call those numbers it shows busy most of the time. When I able to connect it says Your call is important to us and waiting time is 60 min. Is this a joke!! So basically I needed to look for other options but unable to reach airlines. I don’t think airline can imagine the situation. No word to explain how unsatisfied I am.

### "I am not at all satisfied"
This was my experience with SpiceJet and I am not at all satisfied with the services provided. First of all booking page says that it's a non stop flight of duration of 4:20hrs but it's not. (BLR-DEL) Secondly return flight was of 4:20hrs (says non-stop) but it's not. It's via Pune and now the halt has been increased from 30min to 6hrs. There is no use of utilising flight as it's wasting my whole day with a halt of 6hrs. Now while cancelling this return ticket of around Rs 4.2K, te refund amount calculated is just Rs 572. So it's like I had money and I have wasted this with SpiceJet. Kindly review your service and enhance the customer service/booking interface or at least provide clarity to customers. Please don't lie. If there was an option to reveiew SpiceJet in negative, I would have done that without a second thought.

### "Beyond disappointed and disgusted"
We were on SG 174 flying from Dubai to Mumbai on the 30th November, 2020. Our baggage didn’t arrive on the same flight! After harassing almost every single passenger on the plane to pay for excess baggage even if it was just 1 kg, SpiceJethas decided not to load baggage of over 34 passengers on that flight. After a lot of of harassmentand a duration of 4 days, we have received our bags today in the worst possible condition, and they’ve come in an auto rickshaw! ALL our locked bags were tampered with. Beyond disappointed and disgusted!

### "cabin crew were very professional and helpful"
Not Verified |  Bengaluru to Kolkata. Great Service and comfortable journey. The flight was on time. The cabin crew were very professional and helpful. Overall, a comfortable journey. Thank you SpiceJet. Will surely fly again.

### "Excellent experience from ground to air"
Delhi to Patna with SpiceJet. Excellent experience from ground to air, everything was amazing , especially the crew members. Kudos to them. I booked smax and my boarding and everything was on priority.

### "very friendly and helpful"
Got the opportunity to travel on Spicejet during the COVID pandemic. It was a great experience altogether even discounting the fact that I used their SpiceMax service. The cabin crew were very friendly and helpful. The process of boarding and deplaning were also conducted in a professional manner to avoid over crowding.

### "not giving proper answers"
Jabalpur to Delhi. They are delaying the flight without giving any reason. We boarded bus for the flight than they asked us to step down and wait back inside without giving any explanation. Unprofessional attitude, staff has no idea how to handle situation and not giving any proper answers to satisfy the passengers who are waiting. Flight was 40 mins late arriving.

### "generous and well versed staff"
Not Verified |  Great inflight experience with generous and well versed staff. Leg room was disappointing but otherwise a wonderful journey throughout. Would recommend SpiceJet as a flight option to friends and colleagues.

### "Extremely frustrating and pathetic service"
Not Verified |  Extremely frustrating and pathetic service by SpiceJet. Booked flight from Amritsar to Mumbai via Delhi. At the last moment they changed the time and surprisingly laying off time was 16 hrs. Not even having the option to change flight or refund. Never ever had such a traumatic journey since I started travelling.

### "I appreciated the service"
I wanted to let you know how much I appreciated the service provided to me and my family by the crew staff below of SG 968 on 8 November. I know how much time and effort they invested to not only make us safe during these hard times, but also to ensure that all passenger's needs are addressed and fulfilled. These ladies need to be rewarded for their efforts as being at the forefront of all this requires a lot of courage. Once again thanking the bold and beautiful ladies for their service.

### "I never expected such care and warmth"
I would like to appreciate your Cabin Crew for her excellent hospitality and customer service on my trip from Mangalore to Mumbai. I booked a Spice Max ticket and I was offered a vegetarian meal. I asked her if I could exchange it with a non vegetarian meal. She apologized saying there was no non veg option on my ticket. However she tried her best to look if there was non available with her crew member at the back. Unfortunately there was not. She came back to me and offered a few munchies for which I denied. What really impressed me was, she truly was concerned about me being hungry and she offered me her meal saying sir I can offer you my meal, please have it. This gesture of hers made my day. I never expected such care and warmth, she was very grounded and so real, not like she was doing her job. I was treated like a guest and not a mere passenger, she was kind and kept checking if I was really okay, I was truly moved. This was one of my best experiences of customer service in India.

### SpiceJet customer review
Not Verified |  SpiceJet had excellent flight attendants. They were extremely courteous to me and my family, the cleanliness and everything were in proper shape. The flight took off and landed in time. The flight attendant even managed some hot beverages on my request for me and my family. Thank you SpiceJet.

### "Excellent service provided"
Excellent service provided by Mohini & her team. Them took very good care of all passengers. Covid -19 measures/precaution were also taken by the staff in air as well as on ground.

### "Thanks to the empathetic team"
Today the take off of my flight from Chennai to Kochi scheduled at 8.25 was delayed for 1 hour 40 minutes due to bad weather. I landed at Cochin Airport at 11.45am. According to plans I was to reach home in 10.30 am and take part in an important on-line international meeting from 11.30. I conveyed my difficulty to Spicejet officials at the Airport who quickly swung in to action. They contacted the Airport authority and quickly managed a good comfortable and sound proof place for me to switch on the system and engage in the meeting. I could make the presentation well in time. Thanks to the empathetic team who understood the crux of the situation and extended valuable timely help. A

### "well trained and professional Crew"
Very well trained and professional Crew. Flight was hosted with two capable and highly professional set of crews Miss Disha and Miss Mary. Water is not served in a organised manner and some passengers are left. But here distribution was organised. The night before boarding the Flight at CCU I had a minor Fracture a in my ankle so i had removed the shoes during sitting as it was very Painful. After Landing staff assisted me to tie my bandages around and wear my shoes. She wore a Pair of Gloves sprayed sanitisers on the shoes and helped me tie the laces. Social distancing was maintained in the Flight. Prior to this I had a bad experience with Spicejet that was in 2019. After that I never choose Spicejet. Due to some condition I had to choose spicejet. After this recent flight I can feel the difference clearly that spicejet has kept professional crews on board.

### "I was so pleased with the hospitality that the aircrew exhibited"
I am a traveler who took the flight SG140 from Calicut to Dubai. I had to draft this mail because I was so pleased with the hospitality that the aircrew exhibited. The air hosts and air hostesses were very kind and pleasant in their communication with passengers. Also to note was how they kept the washroom sanitized after every five passengers had accessed it. I personally had a very bad headache that day and they helped me overcome that by providing excellent service. They were very polite (although I know it is their job). The steward was very kind to first ask me if I had taken food before getting me a pill and lukewarm water (this matters because medicines have to be taken after food and with lukewarm water and not every flight steward/stewardess bothers to make sure if the passenger has eaten something and if the temperature of the water is right). After this, the stewardess approached me a second time to enquire if I was doing okay and if I needed something which I thought was a very sweet and generous gesture from their side and I was so satisfied and happy because I had never received that kind of treatment on any flight before. I know it is the job of an air host/hostess to attend to the passengers, but to date, on every flight I've been to, none of them have come back to enquire about my health after attending to me once. This gesture, even though it was small, made me feel so contented and I'm pleased to have had the chance to be a passenger on board this flight. Thank you SpiceJet and thank you cabin crew of SG140.

### "Good cabin staff and great service"
Good cabin staff and great service, would surely fly again. Even though they are not serving anything onboard the flight still they made sure I enjoyed a comfortable and safe journey.

### "a great experience"
Had a great experience. The flight was clean, hygienic, good cabin temperature, excellent clarity of announcement, friendly cabin crew/in-flight attendants. Congrats to SpiceJet and the team that flew SG-322 on 26th Oct morning.

### "very helpful and very polite"
I am writing review first time for Spicejet. Liked my travel because of the crew they was very helpful and very polite. Me experience was fantabulous it's saved me in two and half hour flight.

### "cabin crew were so courteous"
Not Verified |  Hyderabad to Bengaluru. SpiceJet just got my heart from check in counters to in air, cabin crew were so courteous and helpful. Kudos to the beautiful girls on board fully covered from top to bottom yet so presentable. Hope to fly with you soon SpiceJet.

### "as usual your cabin crew ere excellent"
Not Verified |  Today I flew after 7 months with SpiceJet and as usual your cabin crew ere excellent. They are the reason I choose SpiceJet. Thanks for making my flight so comfortable and continue to smile though eyes.

### "They are the worst customer service"
Airline cancelled flight due to schedule change (timing of flights did not fall with the Corona mandated closure of airspace), and airline refused to provided a refund despite clearly stated in their T&Cs and know your customer rights for civil air passengers that they must provide either a credit note or a refund according to the customers wishes. Then they decided to only provide a credit shell for the outgoing flight, not the return flight (no airline cancels an outgoing flight but keeps the return flight - completely against all procedures), finally they added a credit note that is not even valid for a year. When we tried to use the credit note, however it was not possible to apply the note on an online booking, all helpline numbers for the company are not active, and no one replied to an email sent requesting immediate assistance. They are the worst customer service, I would never ever fly with them, they do not adhere to their own guidelines nor to the civil aviation customer rights.

### "smooth and quick process"
Overall good experience. They opted for soft copy for boarding pass instead of paper based which is a very wise decision in terms of covid as well as eco friendly. Airhostess ensured that every passenger was using face shield despite the resistance. Also row wise boarding ensure smooth and quick process.

### "appreciation for their customer service"
Our group of 24 traveled on a HiFly charter flight on August 01 from Amsterdam to Bangalore and then took IndiGo flight to Cochin on August 2nd at 12:55 PM. Due to delay in departure from Amsterdam and COVID regulations, we were almost at the edge of missing the connection flight to Indigo but Spicejet staff on the ground made it possible for us. They deserve appreciation for their customer service and commitments, and attention to details.

### "you can do way better"
I did not receive the confirmation email for my booking, although I received promotional email immediately after my booking even I opted-out promotional emails. I traveled from United States to India with two check-in bags and week later I booked a domestic flight in Spicejet. Ticket cost INR 6000+ and also I purchased extra baggage allowance for my 2nd check-in that cost INR 12000+ and total cost is INR18205. Little did I know that I am not qualified to carry my 2nd check-in that cost INR12000. So I contacted customer service and apparently it's not refundable. So I asked them cancel the entire ticket and cancellation charge cost INR4000 even though I purchased their own so called insurance. Their check-in baggage allowance weight is 20kg (44lbs) which is the least of least of airlines I flew so far. I am a very frequent flyer and have been flying from last 15 years in western countries and never ever this happened in any other airlines. These fares are totally unreasonable even for western standards for a 50 mins flight. Come on Spicejet, you can do way better.

### "shameless and insensitive airline"
Not Verified | Me and my son were about to travel from Delhi to Jharsuguda, Due to covid case the authority had sealed the whole society and no one was allowed to go out. SpiceJet had not listened even after providing all the Govt sealing documents, we asked them to at least give a credit note but they are a shameless and insensitive airline.

### "will keep money as credit shell"
I have booked flight with them 3 times during this pandemic to get back home. Every time i give them a call to confirm the status of the flight before I booked but on all 3 occasion it keeps getting cancelled? I pay fair difference too. But now after 3rd failure, when I called them and ask my money back so first they says it not their policy and they will keep money as credit shell. But after long talk they gave me assurance for return the money. But it was all just a joke. Also, their CS team gives misinformation and I filed a complaint twice to them. I am still waiting to hear from them which they promise in next 3 working days. May be once more they make me fool.

### "the worst Airline"
Not Verified |  SpiceJet is the worst Airline. Once the payment is done' they do not care about it's customers. I have been mailing them for weeks trying to contact them to cancel my flight or at least reschedule it but they are not responding at all. The customer care staff is the worst they do not really care about their customers at all. All that matters is money. Once the payment is done they do not care about anybody. Even at this time when the world is fighting Corona they expect me to either board in the flight else I will be refunded on 380 rupees for tickets costing 16000. In case I want to reschedule my flight I will have to pay rupees 3000 per passenger which is illogical. They keep telling us their policies which I believe are not for such epidemic situations. But they won't help us in any way. I will never travel via SpiceJet again and I recommend never ever to choose SpiceJet even in the worst conditions.

### "they knew it'll get canceled"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight from Bengaluru to Patna for 23 March, They changed the flight purposely free of charge, I was still happy thinking that they might have some problem but still they gave me a better option but i didn't know they're doing it on purpose. And giving me a flight which they knew it'll get canceled, So when again when I contacted them the agent told me to change the flight I need to pay almost 11 thousands more, these guys are robbers.

### "Shame on you SpiceJet"
Jaipur to Udaipur. I was about to check in, and I have been denied by the company for improper Seat?. I could not get on board,  so  I had to hire a taxi to reach destination that trip took me the all day to reach destination. As compensation, Spicejet offer me a partial remission instead of full ticket refund. they were supposed to process compensation within 7 up to 10 days. Today I am still waiting for it? Eespite my reminders NO REPLY from their services. This the way SpiceJet customer service are dealing with their customers. What is this behavior? Shame on you SpiceJet.

### "served unexpected complimentary refreshments"
Goa to Jodphur via Mumbai with SpiceJet. Both flights took off and landed on time. I was served unexpected complimentary refreshments on both flights. I had expected to pay for anything but was told that what I was given was free. I had Aisle Seats (4C and 5C) which were reasonably comfortable and leg room was just adequate (I have long legs). The aircraft's were relatively new and clean (I did not use the toilets). Announcements were in both Hindi and English. As expected there was no inflight entertainment. There was a long layover in Mumbai, with the night spent (at my expense) in a nearby hotel, there were no problems with my luggage coming from the flight.

### "worst customer service"
Not Verified |  I have booked my ticket from Hyderabad to Madurai. I live in Canada, due to pandemic around the world everything is cancelled and can't travel to India. Spicejet has the worst customer service. No phone # local or international to talk to. Have emailed them for weeks no response. While every airlines have been helpful. Spicejet is not even responding or helping with anything.

### "helpful ground staff"
Port blair to Mumbai via Chennai. Very helpful ground staff, cabin crew and the counters. Nice co-operation and guidance. Timely takeoff and landing. Temperature maintenance inside flight and convenient.

### "enjoyed before time departure"
Madurai to Mumbai. Excellent experience, enjoyed before time departure as well as arrival. It was a smooth ride with perfect Take-off and Landing. Cabin crew performance was excellent.

### "rude and insensitive staff"
Pune to Delhi. No support from Spicejet Pune Staff at airport. No Humanity an support at the time of crisis situation. Very rude and insensitive staff, rather giving me alternatives he tear my boarding pass in front and not even told me to cancel the flight or book another one or to call the customer service immediately change the first name as my last name was very much present. During this crisis situation people and other airlines helping each other and give them alternatives. Due to some emergency I have to reach to Delhi asap. I have booked the earliest ticket in the night and as we put the web login by mistake it took my last name as my first name. As name history stored in the web of phone.

### "begging to give some complimentary"
Delhi to Guwahati via Kolkaata. Everything was fine until the Supervisor was greedy for money, there was some weight excess in my luggage and in my personal hand bag. I was ready to pay them 8000 which is all the money I have and she was asking for 9400 and I am begging to give some complimentary for my personal handbag. It was morning I was helpless no one picks my call everyone was asleep. Finally my sis picks the call and she's not into any payment gateway so I have to ask her Debit Number and transfer in Patym and transfer back to my account. Within 2 minutes I was ready to pay the required amount. And staff says your times up we can't print your boarding pass system will not accept. I was crazy out there an than after 15 minutes she came nearby the counter and ask one of the employee to process for boarding pass what the hell she can't do it before 15 minutes.

### "Thanks for your patience and support"
Not Verified |  Riyadh to Mumbai on February 21, while landing time I was changing my mobile sim, the sim fall down under the seat steel bar and my selves and some travelers been tried to pulled out sim but not been succeed. I informed to cabin crew, she tried but not been succeed, then inform to technician who came with tools and removed steel bar and took my sim, around 30 minutes they worked on that. I thought I have to omit that sim but they help me lot. Thanks a lot for your patience and support.

### "the worst customer service"
Bangkok to Delhi. SpiceJet has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. When the government of India suspended our visas because we were going to travel from Thailand (because of the Coronavirus), SpiceJet simply didn't care. There is no way to cancel a booking through their web site, and their phone numbers only worked once out of the 30+ times I tried them! Finally, through e-mail I learned I couldn't get a refund, credit, or anything else. I lost hundreds of dollars for nothing - I will never travel with this cut-rate airline!

### "really thankful to Spicejet"
Not Verified |  Mumbai to Hyderabad. I forgot my kindle in the aircraft at morning. I realised this only in the evening during my return flight. I went to the spicejet staff and told him all the details. He did all the background work and got my kindle delivered to me in 30 mins. I am really thankful to Spicejet and its staff for such a prompt and swift action.

### "trying to contact them for 4 days"
Mumbai to Kolkata. Worst response I have faced from Spicejet. I have been trying to contact them for 4 days but no one picking up my phone. Every time it shows busy. In my case  i have booked my ticket for Kolkata for my unicef conference but owing to corona virus issue that conference has been cancelled. Because of that reason either i would like to reschedule my flight or cancel it. I have also put the request of rescheduling of my flight but no use.

### "services from SpiceJet was awful"
The services from SpiceJet was awful. Our flight got canceled twice. First, we booked direct flight Delhi to Bangkok. They canceled without any reason and offered indirect flight Delhi - Bangkok via Kolkata. Second, they canceled our flight Kolkata to Bangkok when we were on board! It was 2.5 hrs before the conecting flight. The operators at the airport weren't helpful and responsive at all. They intensified their tones when we were trying to ask for compensation. After they canceled, we still received a text notifying that the flight will board soon. They played us. I wholeheartedly will not use and recommend this airline.

### "it was worst experience"
I traveled from Delhi to Kolkata and it was worst experience I have had in India and Delhi Airport by SpiceJet staff at check in counter. I will definitely not travel again with SpiceJet in future when I visit to India and will not recommend to others.

### "bad horrible experience"
Ahmedabad to Udaipur. Flight got delayed. Very bad horrible experience. They just speak politely but never tell truth. Ma'am we are going to start boarding in 5 minutes and it's been an hour

### "horrible customer care"
Not Verified |  Colombo to Chennai via Mumbai. The main reason for reviewing SpiceJet is their horrible customer care and their way of communicating. So we tried booking on their website but after payment their website didn't work and we didn't receive the tickets. After calling and emailing for at least 20 times the past month they keep asking the same questions without any progress. We're still waiting for our money back. Also the way they handled the communication around the corona virus and the forms you needed to fill was unclear. We ended up waiting after arrival with the whole plane grouped up filling in extra forms that we didn't receive from SpiceJet.

### "Absolute nightmare"
Not Verified |  Delhi to Varanasi. Absolute nightmare, flight delayed by 3 hours after the boarding call. Crew took no responsibility, no communication after the initial call for passengers to be seated.

### "spicemax doesn't mean anything"
Pune to Ahmedabad. I usually fly spicemax most of the time to have convenience and to save time but that generally doesn't happen. I have tried to provide feedback multiple times through their portal about their spicemax program but mostly it seems they are least bothered about customer feedback or customer satisfaction. Almost 90% of the time spicemax doesn't mean anything for SpiceJet crew. I believe their crew lacks proper training or they don't care for people onboard. I believe they should focus to make this program more robust so that people would feel like paying for the additional facilities. If they treat the same to all than why would one pay the premium to avail additional services.

### "the service was excellent"
We flew SpiceJet twice, both within the country of India. Our first route was Jaipur to Jaisalmer. Our second was Jaisalmer to New Delhi. On both occasions the service was excellent. And the in-flight snacks were generous - a can of flavored almonds and another of popcorn-like makhana seeds. We also arrived to Jaipur 30 minutes early. The seats were a little worn, but since our flights were relatively short we didn't mind.

### "We enjoyed the flight"
Varanasi to Kolkata. Cabin was clean, the crew friendly and helpful. The food served in flight was tasty. We enjoyed the flight.

### "the flight was only 60 mins"
Hyderabad to Vijayawada. The inflight experience was good and flight attendants were courteous and helpful. Though the flight was only 60 mins, the turn around time was swift and I reached safely.

### "they cancelled my flight"
Mumbai to Hyderabad. Very unprofessional as they cancelled my flight just before 10-12 hrs of my departure and expect me to book a different flight where the prices are exorbitantly expensive. The worst airline ever and would never recommend to travel in this flight ever.

### "arrogant, very unapproachable"
Not Verified | My elderly mum and I were travelling from Delhi to Dehradun after flying in from overseas. Very sad state of affairs with the ground staff - very arrogant, very unapproachable and least helpful. The girls appeared as if they are not their to provide any help to their passengers. Apology is the least one would expect for a rather arrogant behaviour of  the female ground staff of spicejet. I sincerely wish this complaint/ feedback is taken up seriously to improve passenger experience.

### "a pretty good flight"
Kolkata to Mumbai. We managed to check in online and for the aisle / window seats, a fee of 200 INR was shelled out however the middle seats were free. The dinner was pre-booked consisting of tawa fish and daal with rice. During the check in all the luggages were checked in a proper manner. However, there was a delay of around 45 mins or so. The seats were comfortable enough for a 2 hour 40 minute journey. The service on-board was quite nice and the crew were attentive. The pre flight meal was also quite nice and also had a plum cake and yogurt for dessert. We landed at Mumbai 1 hour after the scheduled arrival time, but the delay was of little consequence. The baggage was retrieved  swiftly from the baggage belt. Apart from the delay this was a pretty good flight.

### "We were declined boarding passes"
Bagdogra to Goa return via Mumbai. Our return flight time was 5:25 am and we reached the airport at 4:45. We were declined boarding passes because they said we need to arrive 45 mins prior and despite of begging the staff to give us our boarding passes they were rude. We were told that they had already started boarding on the flight and we would not be able to reach the gate in time. This was a really horrible experience. They told me that I would have to pay 1 lakh and 20 thousand rupees for just the return ticket which I of course did not buy. I ended up paying 85000 rupees for the return ticket with a different airline. I will never use or suggest Spicejet to any one.

### "delayed again and again"
Not Verified |  Bangalore to New Delhi. Really worst experience twice. They delay at last moment and leave you with no option. Once they changed the flight timings and didn't even forward me the revised schedule. The second time I had to wait for the flight for 3 hours, being delayed again and again. I would now prefer not flying rather than booking a SpiceJet flight.

### "worst luggage allowance"
Hyderabad to Mumbai. The worst luggage allowance in India. I had 18 kg in check in luggage and 9kg in cabin trolley plus I was carrying another handbag  which they kept and counted as extra luggage, which was 4 or 5 kgs. I was charged for excess of 9 kgs. I requested so they gave me 2 kgs off. I paid 2800. Such a waste of money. Rude and very adamant staff they have.

### "flight itself was pretty nice"
Bengaluru to Kolkata by SpiceJet. As this was a transfer flight to my final destination in Kolkata, the process was very smooth and boarding started well ahead of schedule. Again this flight by a former Jet Airways Boeing 737 and the crew seemed affable enough. I had pre booked the non veg and veg lunch meal for my family members which consisted of a chicken and egg biriyani as the non veg option and veg biriyani as the veg option. The food also had a bun and a cup of yoghurt and even though the meal was not bad, the quantities seemed to be on the lesser side. Landing was in time however I noticed that as the passengers were de-boarding, the crew did not thank the passengers and they had their backs turned instead of thanking the passengers and this was maybe the only negative in what was by and large a very good flight. The pre booked meal on Spicejet seemed to be of more quantity compared to other rival low cost carriers operating in India but still if one has to purchase in flight, it can get expensive as it starts from 250 INR onwards. Even though LCCs are in the habit of maximizing revenue as much as possible, one can be smart about this and perhaps have food before the flight. The flight itself was pretty nice.

### "should not have much expectations"
Mumbai to Bengaluru by SpiceJet. For this morning service, there was massive lines for the baggage drop but eventually was able to drop the checked in luggage. It is important to come well in advance as one could easily miss their flight due to the serpentine nature of the queues. Before dropping the bags, it is important to print the boarding passes / bag tags from the kiosks. The flight was operated by a former Jet Airways aircraft, so the seating was more on the spacious side. Departure and arrival was on time. The crew were also good. I had asked for a glass of water only to be told that she would be giving me later but never did. Thankfully there was another crew member who provided the water. Unfortunately, for my aunt, the crew never really provided her any water when she made a similar request. As the flight was full, the crew managed to slowly get the service done but they did it quite well. While de-boarding, the crew thanked all the passengers which was good. When it comes to low cost carriers, one should not have much expectations except from getting from point A to point B efficiently.

### "served the food with care"
Delhi to Ahmedabad. The crew assisted me in putting my luggage without asking. A seat was a little wet and crew Deepika and Dimi made sure to make the seat comfortable. They served the food with care and delivered well in time. Congratulations for showing such dedicated approach towards work.

### "the service was excellent"
Guwahati to Mumbai, the service was excellent. I was traveling with my wife and son, fantastic experience, awesome food, excellent crew specially under Payal who mainly served us and great team work.

### "delayed again and again"
Patna to Mumbai. Really worst experience twice. They delay at last moment and leave you with no option. Once they changed the flight timings and didn't even forward me the revised schedule. The second time I had to wait for the flight for 3 hours, being delayed again and again. I would now prefer not flying rather than booking a SpiceJet flight...

### "Worst Experience"
Vijayawada to Varanasi via Hyderabad. Worst Experience. They cancelled flight two days before trip. I found an alternative flight with another carrier (Air India or Indigo). They denied to book the flight for me. I asked them to refund money that I need to spend on booking the alternative flight myself (rs 3500), they cannot do that and can only refund 10% of my total fare (rs 700/- ) This is the kind of customer experience, the main reason for fall of airlines in India.

### "Choice of food is good"
Not Verified | Delhi to Chennai. Nice hospitality, cabin crew well-groomed. Swift formalities at departure and arrival. Choice of food is good. May be served even more freshly packed.

### "experience made me so happy"
Hyderabad to Pondicherry. This small experience made me so happy. Ritika and Kanchan the crew on Spicejet SG1004 gave such a excellent service. They made arrangements for my nephew's birthday in not less than 10 minutes and made it really special for him. I'm sure he is not gonna forget this lifetime mid air birthday celebration experience Thank u SpiceJet for having such Amazing crew. Who make the guest feel at home.

### "Spicejet got me this time"
Dubai to Mumbai. Spicejet has weight restrictions. They will get you at the gate If your hand luggage goes above the allocated amount They will pick you out especially if you have duty free bags and charge you for the extra weight. Why are you not told this at check in. All travelers be aware, make sure your carry on does not Exceed the amount allowed, Including your duty free purchase. They charge per kilogram. Spicejet got me this time, but I will not spend another dollar with them again.

### "Rough handling of baggage"
Not Verified |  Rajkot to Mumbai. Crew not able to serve food as ordered, either due to non availability of choices opted or shortage of time as flight was just little over an hour. Rough handling of Checked in baggage. One wheel of the trolley suitcase was broken during the loading/unloading.

### "staff are so careless"
Patna to Hyderabad. I traveled 3 times in this same plane in just 2 months, and in last one week unfortunately I have to traveled 2 times and with same plane. Some staff are so careless. I asked for a glass of water before take-off and didn't get after take-off, and it takes 50 minutes when i asked again to a cabin crew. Spicejet is not comfortable, seats need to be repaired coz it's not good for travel, washroom was in not good condition.

### "disgusting attitude towards customers"
Not Verified |  Worst experience at Kolkata airport. SpiceJet flight to Bagdogra delayed by 4 hours and the gate staff have the most disgusting attitude towards customers. No announcements, No courtesy, no politeness, their only response is the flight visibility is compromised as the weather is bad in Bagdogra. However flights from Delhi have landed in Bagdogra this morning. People are assumed to be stupid and not well informed.

### "Worst flight ever"
Delhi to Dubai with SpiceJet. Delays after delays. From original flight time of 7.45 am to a delay of 2 hours 15 minutes to a further delay of 1 hour 45 minutes to fly. Been waiting on the plane as I write this. Might as well have booked a cheaper afternoon flight. Worst flight ever!

### "staff are efficient"
Not Verified | I always travel by SpiceJet and unlike other airlines, the staff are efficient and so praiseworthy. On my flight today as well, which was from Ahmedabad to Pune SG-523, I was taken care of by your loving staff. I had some trouble with my seat alignment and she was quick to get it resolved. Not every airline has staff like this. It's something they should learn from you.

### "Bad airline, avoid"
The airline demanded to provide the credit card used for ticket payment at the check in. I explained that it was lost and asked for another verification procedure. I was told I would not be able to fly but after 45 minutes of talking just 30 minutes before the departure the airline made me to write a statement saying that I paid for my ticket. My printout clearly showed the tickets were paid for and my passport number was also indicated thereon. Nevertheless the airline has chosen to give me hard time despite the fact that I already took 2 flights with it during the previous 2 weeks. Also although my ticket was Varanasi to Bangkok via Kolkata  the airline refused to check me all the way through and forced me to go through check in again for connecting flight in Kolkata which took more than an hour. Bad airline, avoid.

### "they took care of me"
Mumbai to Kolkata. Spicejet has a perfect onboard crew, they took care of me with utmost care. I had a severe headache and was very uncomfortable, Ms Rafat helped me with medicines, which relived me a lot and I could catch some sleep afterwards.

### "Awesome crew and great food"
Not Verified | Jaipur to Mumbai. Good airline. Awesome crew and great food - red hot spicy. Great connections within India to great destinations. Competitive fare prices and timing good for connections

### "don’t travel with SpiceJet"
Mumbai to Dhaka, arrived nearly 6 hours late. Rubbish service. False commitment and not value for money. Please don’t travel with SpiceJet, get any other airline. They don’t follow the time.

### "No First Aid box available"
SG517 from Bangalore to Kolkata on 11th Jan 2020 - No First Aid box available. The space being very low between seats, when I got the tea in a large cup and tried to place it beside the tray, it spilt and the boiling water went through the magazine rack onto my sports shoes and caused a large blister on my big toe. I could not get any first aid (cotton, bandage or tape) and the air hostesses informed that nothing was available. I finally got tissue and a band-aid to cover the blister and prevent the skin from tearing as I wore my socks and shoes before disembarking from the plane.

### "Very stressful check-in"
Vishakapatnam to Delhi. Very stressful check-in. Was not allowed to carry a single cabin bag and was forced to check-in despite having very fragile things. The duty manager was most unhelpful and made false promises that airline will be responsible for any breakage and then promptly made me sign a document saying the airline is not responsible for anything fragile. All reasoning fell on deaf ears. Most horrible experience as I am sure my things will break and the airline will shrug off their responsibility. Also, I have the right to carry cabin baggage within the weight limits. Surely this is much last flight on a Spicejet

### "Never trust SpiceJet for crucial trips"
Shirdi to Bangalore. Morning Flight from Bangalore to Pune: Have completed the long security check queue and reached the GATE 40 min before flight take off since we were three people travelling to Pune and we had further journey to made. In my case it was all three of us travelling on single PNR and they are just yards away from gate attendant told only i can get into flight and travel where the others request not obliged. When i asked she closed the GATE took us to security as we told no check-in bags signed and asked us to go and she left. If the people are late i agree and they were only yards short it was 3 ticket loss and entire plan for that day. Flight from Pune to Bangalore Vice versa and Bangalore to Mumbai and Vice versa on Most of the time delayed and they dont even respond. Flight from Shirdi to Bangalore on 5th Jan 2020 scheduled at 4 40 pm (16:40). The family trip to shirdi where my team booked Twenty four tickets including three infants. They only reason booked with SpiceJet was because of their Departure time was 4:40 PM which was suiting our plan of Aarti in Shirdi Sai Mandir and lunch. We recieved message and call on that day morning 10:30 as the Flight has cancelled and book for alternative. The team showered regrets for inconvenience and suggested to Travel via Chennai or Hyderabad the same day for few and other next day. There were lot of request made by us because we had infants and aged people agreed for next day travel. But when they started confirming they said only few can get direct Bangalore flight next day and others has to travel via other cities. With no other option left with us since we had our schedules were messed up we did not want to take any risk. Next day the Via city travel flight got delayed and all of us travelled to airport and for our surprise the scheduled one was also delayed and we have told only after 4:40 PM. We checked for Direct flight for others and surprise to see there were lot of seats vacant and they were not willing to confirm other day. Since, we had aged and infant people in group we requested them to allow in direct as there were lot of empty seats. When we entered aircraft and took off saw there were still many empty rows I was like why the team did not allocate my other team for Direct flight earlier and pushed them with hands up for all our request earlier to confirm. Never trust SpiceJet for crucial trips.

### "Fantastic experience"
Not Verified |  Kolkata to Dhaka. Fantastic experience, great hot food, excellent staff under Piyali and Felicita who mainly served me, but the priority luggage handling at the arrival airport left much to be desired.

### "Check in was great"
Delhi to Guwahati. Check in was great, cleanliness of aircraft, good Staff. Very helpful crew. Announcements were  Clear in both the languages.

### "deeply grateful to SpiceJet"
On traveling from Jaipur to Udaipur my bag was flagged for screening at airport check in and in the process of inspection, my case containing some sentimental and personal jewelry was accidentally left behind. Not only Spicejet located it from the Lost & Found Office at Jaipur but flew it to Udaipur within twenty-four hours and had it carefully wrapped, handed back after checking my passport details and boarding pass. The process of retrieval was outstanding and I am deeply grateful to SpiceJet for their efficiency and professionalism.

### "Very disappointed"
Hyderabad to Jaipur. The cabin crew was not at all helpful. This experience has made us realise not to choose Spicejet again for our trips. Very disappointed.

### "my last flight with SpiceJet"
Delhi to Kolkata. This is probably going to be my last flight at Spice Jet, SG-272 had my worst experience ever, now the flight has been delayed but i have been on delayed flights before this but this takes it to new heights because my flight was to depart at 9:25 but I received notification that it was going to depart at 1:45 pm at 11:15 am which was already 2 hours after the original departure time. All other flights namely indigo were departing at their times normally only spice jet planes somehow didn't take off, thats just so problematic. Then again I received a message on my phone at 1 pm that it was going to take off at 2:30 then finally it took off at 3pm. When we landed the crew were least bothered to know the belt number the luggage is going to be available at, they said it was going to be at belt-8 but it was available at 9 which i found out on enquiring separately, after waiting almost 15-20 minutes at Belt-8 which stopped. It was a horrible spice jet experience, and thats why its probably going to be my last flight with SpiceJet.

### "Cancelled the trip"
Not Verified |  Delhi to Shirdi. Worst airline. Cancelled the trip from Delhi to Shirdi few minutes before the boarding. No heads up and advanced notice. Spent 1000 Rs on uber not to mention the early morning inconvenience with my family. There is zero accountability and 100% incompetence top to bottom.

### "Spicemax was worth it"
Bangkok to Delhi. Added Spicemax to our ticket and it was worth it. Had a complimentary Glenfiddich with my free meal. Food was good, if a bit bland. Leg room was good in seat 7E. Staff were pleasant and on the ball. Tiniest toilet I've ever been in, but we don't spend much time there! Highly recommended.

### "Unprofessional"
Unprofessional, every two weeks once I travel to Tirupati from Hyderabad. My tickets were prebooked by company and seat allocated. Once we come to that desk they will change seat and will give their preference seat. Actually mine is 2B, have given 3D ,if we question it’s not confirmed they will say. Its not first time, always.

### "precise, respectful and behaved professionally"
Hyderabad to Kishangarh with SpiceJet. Flight was comfortable. Toilet cleanliness and hygiene is thing to worry about. Inflight attendants were precise, respectful and behaved professionally. SpiceJet primarily struggles with timelines.

### "Delayed by 8 hours"
Delhi to Bengaluru. Flight Delayed by 8 hours and we were not even provided food or lounge access. First they told that our flight is delayed by an hour and at check in they informed that inter connecting flight will be hard to catch due to delay so we suggest you to take another flight after 8 hours! Despite having a senior citizen as a customer they did not provide lounge and food for the 8 hours delay.

### "unprofessional and unethical"
We are a family of 4 traveling to Shirdi and at the gate, we were told the flight on 19 December has been cancelled due to inclement weather at Shirdi. I checked with the local guys and the weather was fine with 30 C high and clear sky. There were other flights which landed at Shirdi today. Clearly, Spicejet was hiding the real reasons. My travel plan was disrupted completely, and also my hotel and other bookings were lost as well. Very unprofessional and unethical.

### "charged due to overweight bag"
Delhi to Bangalore. At the boarding pass counter. the counter staff charged me due to overweight bag due to snack items which I ate even before boarding. Flight was late for hours and in flight environment was very irritating. It may be a cheap flight but at cost of mental peace. Looks like the staff do not want customers to travel again with them.

### "food was very poor"
Not Verified | New Delhi to Aurangabad. Quality of food was very poor. Food was tasteless and not fresh. Though they have kept the food hot using an oven. Please request improve the quality and quantity of food to justify the price tag.

### "12 hours to board the flight"
Hyderabad to Tirupati. We waited for 12 hours to board the flight which was really annoying. Very disappointed with the service of Spicejet. This happened for continuous 2 days.

### "Truly a horrendous experience"
Mumbai to Kochi. Our problems started at the check-in desk, where the woman checking us in visibly rolled her eyes at us when we approached the counter. When we arrived in Kochi, I was informed that my bag had been kept in Mumbai because of a powerbank (which the check-in lady did not ask us about). Now, I understand why they have this policy, and that's not the problem I had with SpiceJet, as I realize that part is my fault. The problem was how SpiceJet customer service handled it. No information, hanging up on me every time I called to check the status of my bag, needing me to send the appropriate paperwork multiple times before removing the powerbank and sending me my bag (which took over 48 hours). I don't understand why it's so difficult to simply remove the powerbank (which I gave permission to do) and send the bag. Yet for some reason, the people who work for this airline are completely incompetent. Not only that, but I received a message on WhatsApp that my bag was arriving on a certain flight, so I drove 1.5 hours to pick it up. But when I arrived, the bag was not on the flight! Instead, it was on the next flight which landed 3 hours later. Since we were about to leave Kochi and go to Alleppey, I had to wait for it. I spoke with the people working at the SpiceJet counter in Kochi airport, who didn't seem to care at all and kept saying "well maybe it will come tomorrow". I made it clear I wasn't leaving without the bag, and told them I'd wait for the next flight. I left to get some food, and when I returned, no one was there -- the counter was closed. Fortunately I was able to get the terminal manager to help me get my bag, but if they weren't going to be there, why the hell didn't they just say so when I told them I'd be returning? Truly a horrendous experience with SpiceJet customer service, both in person and on the phone -- completely unhelpful in every way possible. The second time we flew SpiceJet was no better, as we were charged double the price of our ticket to change our flight by one day (even though online it says you only have to pay the difference of the fares, which is a lie). On top of that, there were over $100 of hidden fees added to the ticket price, which we were not informed about until it was time to pay. We were told we either had to pay it, or we'd lose our current flight AND the new reservation. Nothing about this airline makes sense, worst customer service I've ever experienced.

### "arrived 49 mins late"
Bangalore to Kolkata arrived 49 mins late. They don't care for customer its always late. I had miss my 2 connecting flight while travelling with this airline. Please don't travel with Spicejet If you want to save your time and energy.

### "I am very disappointed"
Cochin to Chennai, I am very disappointed on your service. We came to know that the flight is cancelled when we arrived at airport only. This was so disrespectful from your side.It was your duty to inform us at-least 3 hour before. T You also changed your flight number on November 21st, we booked ticket for another flight and you changed the flight that is not an issue still, you are not sticking to anything. Customer service is so poor.

### "15 kg only is too little"
Not Verified |  Kolkata to Mumbai. I have a good experience with cabin service . Other thing bad was the money I have paid for my bag it weighed 22kg, I paid 2800 IR because allowed weight of 15 kg only is too little. It will be better to raise allowed weight to 20 as in Air India, I travelled by Air India during internal flight allowed weight was 2 bags, 20 kg each. So I am so annoyed from this issue.

### "Seats are also comfortable"
Mumbai to Kolkata. Wonderful experience on a budget airline. Found the cabin and washroom clean. Seats are also comfortable. The only thing is that they should explore many more routes.

### "Worst flying experience"
Goa to Mumbai. Worst flying experience ever. The flight was delayed by 2 hours, due to some operational problems. The staff was extremely unprofessional and rude. I paid for the meal beforehand but the flight host was not ready to give me my meal for no reason. Finally, he gave me a tasteless sandwich after asking multiple times. Even on my Mumbai to Goa flight, the staff was super rude. Either they are not trained at all or they are being underpaid, and hence they take out all the frustration on their passengers. Never flying again on Spicejet for sure.

### "Avoid this airline at all costs"
Mumbai to Varanasi. I tried to buy baggage online leading up to the flight but it would not let me. I then told them at the airport along with screenshots showing my request on Twitter. She was not bothered at all. Charged me full price. Avoid this airline at all costs. There is a reason they're ratings are so low.

### "was a lovely flight"
Not Verified | Kolkata to Delhi. It was a lovely flight, the cabin crew was wonderful and the hospitality was awesome. The food was lovely too. One of the cabin crew was not well but the other members of the crew took over her job and it was great teamwork. Hats off to these lovely staff.

### "I am highly disappointed"
Bangalore to Hyderabad. It is just so sad that I had to pay extra for discomfort. My flight kept delaying. Technical issue or not will the company take any responsibility for safety at night. Is it even ethical to keep delaying. Issues keep coming but how can you ignore the discomfort it has caused people due to it. Sorry will not help. Do your job the right way. I am highly disappointed.

### "charging for hand luggage"
Not Verified |  Dharamshala to Delhi. Spicejet's staff in Dharamshala airport is trying to make some extra money here, charging for hand luggage, when I have brought the same hand luggage on my way from Kolkata via Delhi to Dharamshala without any extra fee.

### "it was my worst journey ever"
Not Verified |  Mumbai to Kanpur. I must say it was my worst journey ever. When I booked my flight the time was 10.45 am and after a week they messages saying that it will be taking off at 1.45 pm. The flight took off after 2.30pm, I dont understand why they don't value time. I must suggest please don't book with SpiceJet. Also for luggage, at the time of booking they dont indicate that you can't take cabin luggage and the day before the flight they circulated a message that no cabin luggage was allowable. If there was an option to give a minus star I would.

### "cannot expect any better"
Kolkata to Kochi via Chennai. From ticketing to delivery of Luggage including transfer and  very tasty food provided with excellent cabin crew service was excellent. Only issue being maintainability of strict timing which will help if passengers are on a schedule or transfer time to connecting flight is less/short. Rest is top-notch, cannot expect any better.

### "courteous crew cabin"
Delhi to Mumbai. Perfect service, courteous crew cabin as well as ground. There was a 15 mins delay in flight which was very well informed to the passengers with a message of sorry. The Captain again apologized for the delay. The cabin crew is perfect behaved respects all passengers.

### "the airline staff mislead"
Not Verified | Delhi to Chennai. Had paid for an exit seat at the time of purchase of the flight. However, at the check-in counter I was made to believe that the seat selected was not an exit but a regular middle seat. The employee at the counter very generously agreed to change it and assign me an aisle seat. Well, it was a rude shock upon boarding to see that my original seat was indeed an exit seat. Why would the airline staff mislead a fare-paying passenger? More surprises. After a 2 hour delay, the flight crew was busy providing sample drinks and indulging in small talk with a group of passengers without any consideration that the rest of the passengers were trying to get some sleep. After all, it was past midnight. I don't think it was too much to ask of the flight crew to service the needy passengers without boring or bothering the rest about their drink choices.

### "denied the entitled meals"
Patna to Chennai. I had upgraded to Spicemax considering facility of extra leg space and on-board meals. But to my surprise, so call leg-space is a big disappointment as the space is very little and uncomfortable. I was very rudely denied the entitled meals onboard by cabin crew member. His behaviour made us feel humiliated onboard. Raised a complaint to the customer relations, but it is useless as they have not yet investigated the issue.

### "faced a lot of inconvenience"
On my recent journey from Hyderabad to Surat we I had an excess baggage of 5kg (check-in) luggage for which I was requested to pay, and I agreed to instantly. While the process was being done peacefully, on duty manager argued that my hand bag should also be weighed along with my cabin bag and the total weight should be 7kgs only. The airline policy clearly states that each passenger is allowed cabin bag of maximum 7kgs and hand bag free of cost. We were a group of 13 people, and accordingly every passenger is allowed a cabin bag and a hand bag free of cost, but staff was hell bent on making us pay extra for the hand bag (which is essentially my purse). He was rude, and has no idea what he was talking. We have been frequent flyers with Spicejet and usually the staff is very polite and considerate. We choose Spicejet for their hospitality and are loyal customers since years. We wasted our time and energy and faced a lot of inconvenience. This behavior is unaccepted and intolerable.

### "Flight condition is also awful"
Bengaluru to Shirdi. Got message of early flight, after reaching airport flight was delayed by 30min. I had previous 4 hrs delay with Spicejet, due to which I lost my other connecting flight. Worst services no respect for the customer time. Flight condition is also awful.

### "efficient and warm onboard service"
New Delhi to Kolkata. Delighted with the prompt, efficient and warm onboard service provided by the crew. Appreciate their efforts towards customer centricity.

### "worst experience ever"
Bangalore to Delhi. The worst experience I had, flight landed at 1AM, waited till 3.30AM to collect my bag but not received. I visited airport on next day at 8 PM, it’s already 11.05 PM till now not received my bag and simply asking me to wait for 10mins from long time. Worst experience, even I have seen 4-5 members with same issues. The worst experience ever.

### "crew members really good"
Delhi to Banglore. The crew members were really very good. It's not the airline, its the members and employees give you a good experience, and in this matter, I can rate Spicejet crew members much better than my previous flying experience with Air India and Indigo.

### "late for more than 4 hrs"
Hyderabad to Delhi. One of the worst flight I have ever travelled on. On my journey to Hyderabad and back to Delhi, the flight was late for more than 4 hrs. Wasn't the case with other flights going on the same route. Think before You travel through this airline.

### "not received any communication"
Not Verified |  I flew Spicejet from Bangkok to Delhi on October 23 and booked my return for November 3, 2019. In my first attempt at the transaction, the booking failed but the amount of 9,506 Thai Baht was debited from my account, which is yet to be refunded. I have since written to them on 5 different occasions starting October 10 on the following dates: October 15, 18, 21, 23 and 26. In the last two emails the nodal officer was additionally looped in. I am taking to this platform because I have not received any communication from SpiceJet since October 15 and it's been well over three weeks since the transaction failed. I hope the message is loud and clear and worthy of attention from your end.

### "the flight is cancelled"
Not Verified |  Goa to Mumbai. The check in counter staff kept on saying that the flight is delayed and at 4.30 hrs she was said that the flight is cancelled and was informed that she can arrange for alternative flights. The spicejet staffs were so unprofessional that they did not even try to accommodate them to any other flight!

### "have to pay for extra luggage"
Mumbai to Hyderabad. When I reached Bombay luggage need to collect and checkin again. Spicejet guys say 15kg main luggage and 7kg hand luggage, I told this is not my local trip this is my international connecting and I show my international boarding pass. She told me you have to pay for extra luggage if you need to travel. I don't have time I read to pay, I had 25kg luggage she sad you need to pay for 10kg no hand luggage. When I asked she refused to answer my questions. Spicejet roughly behaved and he doesn't know how to handle customer

### "no care and service"
We lost our checked-in baggage travelling from Delhi to Bangkok. On losing my baggage: 1. I found out that there is no representative from Spicejet on Bangkok Airport to report the issue. 2. On my own after running around, I found out the baggage handling partner. 3. I coordinated on my own with that partner with difficulty, as the employees are not well versed in basic English. 4. I registered complaint with them in writing, after running from pillar to post taking over an hour. 5. In the process I missed my pre-booked transportation to Pattaya (where I was travelling) and had to take a cab on-the-spot. I received my baggage afterwards coordinating with them. Spicejet remained clueless, if I received my bag or not. I was travelling with my wife and 3 yr old kid. The airline refused to compensate me for the baggage loss and the mental trauma. Never travel in this low-cost budget airline, which does not provide any care and service.

### "too costly for short trip"
Not Verified |  Madurai to Chennai. My flight was for 50 minutes and cabin crew was not even attentive to give water. All the food available in catalogue was not served. Every time we ask for any choice of the food, crew asked me to show on the menu. Pathetic service and too costly for short trip.

### "service standard was adequate"
Dharamsala to Delhi. Airline schedules only 20 minutes from the arrival of the inbound aircraft to the departure. It’s impossible to turn around a Q400 in that time so of course it was late. The captain’s announcement needs work, his ‘holding and bad weather into Delhi’ announcement was too technical for the average passenger. He also promised an update but never did. Aside from these deficiencies the service standard was adequate.

### "very worst service of Spicejet"
Bangalore to Mangalore. Ahmedabad to Bangalore I travelled with IndiGo, they allowed me 2 kg extra luggage. But in Spicejet they didn't allow it, since it was just 2 kg they could have allowed. This is very worst service of Spicejet.

### "never faced such rude and insulting behaviour"
On October 11, 2019 I travelled from Silchar to Kolkata by Spicejet. Flight SG 3219. Flight was delayed by 2 hrs 45 min. Your crew started serving food and beverage. I purchased a cup of tea by paying Rs. 100. But I found the tea was cold. I brought it to your crew, a lady. She asked me whether I had sipped the beverage. I answered, of course. But she didn’t believe me. To my utter surprise, she asked another co-passenger, who was also having tea, whether his beverage was hot enough. He responded, might be, 'yes'. She then turned to me and said, he is saying the tea is hot enough. To my utter disbelief, she poured some water from the pot. I didn't say anything but kept the cup full of tea or to be precise some lukewarm water and a piece of biscuit. I could have argued that my co passenger purchased the beverage when she began serving and I purchased while she was coming back from one round. But I didn't say anything. But I wonder how could a lady pour some water, maybe to her belief hot enough, to the cup of tea without even thinking that what would be the taste of the beverage. But one thing I must tell you, you can cheat your passenger but you dont have any right to insult them. I am regular flier on this route but never faced such rude and insulting behaviour from any cabin crew.

### "some room for improvement "
Trivendrum to Mumbai. In general good experience. however there is quite some room for improvement in areas such as the selection of food items, training to the cabin crew, cleanliness of the cabin, punctuality in arrival and departure.

### "everything was flawless"
SpiceJet flight from Delhi to Bengaluru. This was a very good flight where everything went very smoothly from check in using the kiosk machines to the baggage drop, everything was flawless. The boarding started before the scheduled time which was a plus point and the flight was very full. One slight disadvantage is the need to pre pay the seat while doing online check in. However, if one arrives at the airport early enough one can select their seat preference without needing to pay the additional cost. But then this is a practice most LCCs do. The plane itself was used formerly by Jet Airways, so the seat pitch was on the more generous side which was well appreciated for a trip that was lasting 2 hours and 50 minutes long. We took off before departure time, the crew were proactive and personable enough with the fellow passengers when it came to the food / drinks. The pilots also announced and kept us updated regarding the flight path. Arrival was also well before the scheduled time and collecting the baggage was done quickly without the need to wait for long. Overall I'd say that on flights with longer durations, having a seat pitch which is more on the generous side really helps a lot. Would I consider flying SpiceJet again? If there is a good deal available.

### "I had a good experience"
Mumbai to Delhi. From departure to arrival I had a good experience. Staff were polite and professional. Clean and very quiet aircraft.

### "an unpleasant and embarrassing experience"
Not Verified |  I was flying from Kabul to Bangkok via Delhi and back, the same route. I paid for the Spicemax (or similar) service - 30kg for 2 pieces checked-in luggage (not just 20kg), extra leg room, a meal and a non-alcoholic drink. SpiceJet manged to be delayed (departure time) on 5 out of 4 planned flights: one flight was so delayed that I would not catch the connecting flight in Delhi - and I was not let on board. Thus I had to stay in Bangkok for one more day (no compensation for the hotel whatsoever). The next day, the plane was overcrowded - forget the extra leg room! Also, staff were always checking x-times if I was entitled for something to drink. It was an unpleasant and embarrassing experience. I will try to avoid SpiceJet at any cost. You do not get what you paid for in many terms. Losing time, energy and money when you cannot fly on the planned day is absolutely not worth it.

### "lot of false promises"
I recently took flight from Dubai to Pune and I can't believe what great cheats they are. First they are taking undue advantage of your situation and charging heavily for any excess baggage (approx 1400 INR per kg). I paid 15k for my excess baggage and they did that for most passengers and later all of our baggage was left behind as they did not have enough space in the flight and no information was provided to us. They just keep making money by accepting all there is to take. Upon landing in Pune they informed us what they have done and delivered a lot of false promises about refunds and compensation to pacify us. Later when I followed up with their customer care they didn't even bother to reply; cause they know they have already got the money and later when I complained again they bluntly refused to pay any compensation or refunds. They are extremely unprofessional and liars and cheats. Don't fall for their scams like me and from my experience I will tell you better to pay 1000 bucks extra and travel with other airline who don't do all this funny business and have better professionalism.

### "the seats were awful"
Dubai to Delhi. The main thing, which I didn't like at all is the Air-hostess attitude. Even after pressing the button for calling, nobody turned up. There were 4 girls in the flight, however, they were rude and no smile while asking for anything. Disappointed. Also, the seats were awful. The seat belt was torn. Cleanliness zero. Our flight reached at 3:45 and we had to wait till 4:45 to get our luggage.

### "pleased with staff on each of the segments"
I flew three segments on SpiceJet (Dhaka-Kolkata, Kolkata-Chennai, and Chennai-Colombo) and I was pleased with staff on each of the segments. In particular, the staff on Kolkata-Chennai segment was very helpful, courteous, and pleasant. It's the crew that makes the airline, truly. On the other hand, the systems of SpiceJet are broken. Two examples: (1) On this same route, I had a ticket with all three segments under the same Record Locator. However, since a flight was modified by the reservation staff, their internal system showed them under different locators so I had to manually collect baggage and check-in baggage at every point - three check-ins, three baggage collections, and two re-check-ins! This needs to change. Airlines exist for customers, customers don't exist for airlines. (2) On a previous reservation that was cancelled by SpiceJet and refunded in full, the full refund was issued as a new transaction rather than reversal of the previous charge. Due to Exchange rate difference, this resulted in a loss of $7.95 to me, without having received anything other than headaches from SpiceJet.

### "disheartened by the approach"
Coimbatore to Delhi. We are travelling abroad the next day from Delhi. We were charged on an excess baggage of 4 kilos and paid 1600. We expected the airline to cooperate, but had got no support. It’s pretty logical that if somebody is travelling abroad on a holida , one is bound to have a little excess baggage. A little bit of help could have changed our perception of the airlines. We were disheartened by the approach. We are not going to travel again in Spicejet for sure.

### "pathetic seats and service"
Not Verified | Dubai to Pune. Very bad and pathetic seats and service. Baggage allowances are there to trick customers. Here Duty-free in also included as a part of baggage which is unheard in other places and airports

### "Not even a sorry"
Kolkata to Delhi. Worst airline ever. Always delayed. Not just one-off case but all flights are delayed. They do not even give prior intimation to passengers for the delay and was informed via message just 15 mins before the scheduled boarding time that flight is delayed by 2 hours. No bad weather or any unusual conditions, rather just a regular casual attitude. The flight will not land in Delhi at 3 am in the morning and it's so unsafe to travel at this time in the city. Only Hassle to passengers without any compensation or facility by them. Not even a sorry.

### "flights are always delayed"
Mumbai to Bangalore. Pathetic airline. The flights are always delayed, I have traveled multiple times with SpiceJet and not even a single time did the flight take off on time. They do not respect the customers time. I am not going to travel with SpiceJet ever again.

### "nobody knew where was bag scanning"
Kolkata to Bangkok. Bag scanning process before check-in was designed to help you exercise! The airline didn't put up any sign, so nobody knew where was the bag scanning station! We had to make 2 trips for checking in and bag scanning, which definitely weren't pleasant.

### "unprofessional attitude"
Jaipur to Mumbai. The flight was delayed by an hour and the gate was changed mins before boarding without any announcement. Very unprofessional attitude. Clearly the airline doesn't prioritize customer service. Very disappointed

### "One of the worst experiences"
Not Verified |  Mumbai to Chennai. One of the worst experiences I’ve ever had with a flight. I was stuck in traffic and I knew I wouldn’t be able to make it before 45 mins, so I called the airline and they said they’d mark my PNR and send their staff to help me with the stuff. On reaching the airport and literally pushing everyone aside turns out there was no spicejet guy there to help us out. Moreover when we reached the check-in counter they refused to accept that we had our PNR nums marked and said that they couldn’t help us at all. Later, the senior executive came and spoke to us. Honestly, she couldn’t help us with the situation at all and later when we told her about the call center person who told us she’d arrange help, the senior executive asked for her name and asked us to call her back and if we couldn’t do that we could book another flight. She had a lot of attitude and just showed that she was least bothered in helping us. They have stupid officials at their call center who just know what to say or what to do. I’d strictly recommend anyone reading this to never use Spicejet as they have horrible services. This is just one of the most disastrous experiences I’ve ever had with any of the airlines. Later on, we had to book another flight to get back so yes we chose indigo which is a way better flight than spicejet. We had to book our tickets at the airport itself and since the ticket counter was very crowded the indigo official took us to book our tickets, took our baggage and made it very hassle free for us.

### "ran out of all possible food options"
Kochi to Malé with SpiceJet. It was a mixed experience. They ran out of all possible food options by the 3rd row of the service itself. We got to choose only some nuts and biscuits only. Crew were having either a take it or leave it attitude so didn’t expect much from them either. Nevertheless it was a decent flight with average seating.

### "a good experience"
Recently I traveled from Delhi to Adampur with my colleague, it was a good experience through this airline. The overall facility, plane cleanliness, seating comfort and the crew of this airline was helpful, the ground staff was ok but it has to be more customer-centric. I suggest traveling with this airline

### "you will be dissatisfied and left irritated"
Bengaluru to Hyderabad. SpiceJet is excellent at giving you a bad experience. From begining to end you will be dissatisfied and left irritated. The web check fails often, the physical check in counter is not easily available nor any instructions. The staff have a poor attitude so don't expect any actual help. The planes are not the best or even good ones. They seem too old for 2019. Inflight service is alright. Staff have the same attitude in the air as on the ground. If your bag is detained, don't expect them to let you know. You'll have to find out yourself, and they'll do little to help besides bringing the bag to the city. No inflight internet. Overall terrible service and experience. Would not recommend.

### "improve your operational way"
Mumbai to Bengaluru. Without any prior information they are delaying the flight, and giving reasons due to weather conditions and then said technical issue. All other flights are flying apart from this, weather effect only this flight. Even I call on customer care no and they said we are not able to help you. Please improve your operational way.

### "Worst flight experience"
Goa to Pune. Worst flight experience so far, I have not seen such ignorant flight attendants. I had a meal in my ticket pre booked, but didn't receive one. I asked the same to the flight attendants. She just heard and then left. So rude that she didn't even convey back. Will never travel again by Spicejet.

### "have never had such a disgusting experience"
An utterly terrible experience. My baggage was removed from the plane along with several other passengers. We were only informed about this after we had waited at the baggage rack for an hour in Dubai. This was at 12pm. Thereafter, we were told to come back at 3pm as our baggage would be flown in by then. Even though SpiceJet caused the issue, they refused to have our baggage delivered and they refused to compensate for costs to go to and from the airport (which is quite high in Dubai). When I got back to the airport to pick up my baggage at 3, they delayed further and we waited until 4.30-5 to get our luggage. The SpiceJet manager at Dubai airport refused to speak to us and was literally hiding in the SpiceJet office. Look, these things happen, but it is the airline's responsibility to do everything it can to ensure no further trouble is caused. I have never had such a disgusting experience with any other airline and will never, ever travel with SpiceJet ever again.

### "I am highly disappointed"
Chennai to Guwahati via Kolkata. I am highly disappointed by their service. I had requested them to put my baggage in the priority list and had paid extra as I was in a hurry for a bus which was soon after my flight. I have had travelled in Spicejet before and with my experience I already had a feeling that my Spicejet flight might be late; this is why I had demanded for the facility. But even then, they didn't put any priority tag on my luggage and my luggage arrived 15 mins late at the Guwahati airport. My first flight was 40 mins late, the next one being 20 mins late. I think spicejet needs to improve their services and at least provide the required services for the paid stuff, if not free. Never travelling with spicejet again, unless that'd be my last option.

### "they didn't load our baggage"
Not Verified |  We flew from Dubai to Pune on the 4th and they didn't load our baggage. It's been two days without clothes or necessary items and medications and the airline is taking no responsibility, offering no solution, or any reimbursement for the inconvenience. I'm here on holiday to attend a family function and my baggages are held up. This is honestly the worst service and the worst airline.

### "nothing less than shameful"
Dubai to Mumbai, the experience of flying spice jet was nothing less than shameful. With spice jet you should be careful while checking in, yes I understand 30kg is your limit, but I saw a gentleman being asked to remove even 1 kg extra. It's of course the airline policy but this was certainly something a airline staff could have handled better. Having checked in without any fuss, luckily, I was  excited as I was taking my 1st international trip with spice jet. No one was allowed to check in hand luggage over 7 kgs, which includes duty free spirits and other items bought. 10000 rupees for hand carry without warning is insane.

### "our whole trip was ruined"
I had booked four tickets from Spice Jet to fly from Pune to Cochin. It was a pre-planned holiday and two out of four were on their honeymoon. We had everything booked and scheduled - the cab, itinerary, hotel bookings and everything was paid in advance. Spice Jet being such a reputed and big airline spoiled the whole holiday with their unprofessional ignorant attitude. We reached the Pune airport at 10 a.m. on 29 July as our flight was scheduled to fly at 11:25 a.m. and we issued the boarding pass on the kiosk and the same was sent to us on WhatsApp by Spice Jet team. We proceeded for the security check. Upon reaching there the security officer asked us to report at the check-in counter, at the counter we were shocked to know that the flight had been delayed by four and a half hours and later got cancelled due to some technical issues. Spice Jet officials straight away denied that they cannot do anything about it and we have to see something else on our own. After a lot of heated argument they agreed on shifting us to the immediate next flight from the Pune airport but we were given wrong information about the available flights too. There was a Go Air flight at around 1 p.m. which we agreed on taking to and later on they refused us to accommodate in that flight. We did not know what to do as we had a schedule to follow right after our landing in Cochin. When we requested them for some other options, we were told there was a flight at 4 - 4:30 p.m. Indigo flight which is a direct flight to Cochin. We agreed as there were no other seats available in any other flight. But when I checked it online, it was via Bangalore that was taking about six hours to reach Cochin. Had I not checked it, they would have shifted us there with this misinformation. This is such an unprofessional behavior. If the flight is cancelled last minute then ethically they should support their customer who is suffering because of the last minute cancellation rather than giving up on them and providing them with wrong information. Then I checked the online flights available and saw Go Air had an available flight from Mumbai at 5:20 p.m. which was landing at 7:35 p.m. which was still suitable as we had time to reach the hotel at least. Spice Jet team first did not agree to this then after requesting to SpiceJet senior team member that our entire money will go waste, earlier he refused but after pursuing him a lot he booked us in the Go Air flight from Mumbai. The Spice Jet person after booking it told us that your bookings are done and we’ll offload you from the airport and you go and get a taxi on your own at around 11:45 a.m. Pune to Mumbai taxi fares are high, we were not prepared for it and also we were not liable to paid it too. When I requested they out rightly refused, after a lot of argument they agreed for the taxi. We took our flight from Mumbai and landed at Cochin at 7:30 p.m. Our whole day was spoiled because of the last minute flight cancellation. We are middle class people, we plan the holidays in advance and take a fixed budget. After this, our whole trip was ruined.

### "the worst service ever"
Not Verified |  Mumbai to Chennai. Pathetic and the worst service ever. In the afternoon we get a message saying that the Flight is going to be delayed by 4 hours, and when reaching the Airport we are informed that there is another hour of delay added, When asked they say some technical issues. Even mailing the customer care or the service team doesn't get any proper response and they just keep apologizing and with no efforts to correct or ensure correctness, all that matters to them is the Money and only money.

### "the smell from toilet "
Calicut to Bangalore. Me and wife got the last row seats. But the atmosphere was terrible - the smell from toilet made the journey disastrous. We felt like as if we are travelling in Indian railway compartment. Even though after complaining, the cabin crew did try with air freshener and all, that was not enough to stop the smell.

### "offloaded our baggage"
Not Verified |  My Family traveled from Dubai to Delhi on 31 July 2019. The Flight was delayed by 3 hours. The real problem that my family faced was that Spice Jet offloaded their baggage without informing them, so my wife kept waiting at the belt for 2 hours at the belt at Delhi Airport only to be told that the baggage will come with next flight. What is this? No airline ever offloaded our baggage before without our permission. With falling standards, this Airline will not fly for long.

### "Horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Horrible experience, we booked friday evening flight Pune to Delhi that day flight delay for 2 Hours because of some technical issue. We agree for one day there is some technical issue, but today we book Delhi to Pune flight now flight is delay for 6 hours because of technical issue. This is not acceptable at all.

### "there is room for improvement"
Not Verified |  Dubai to New Delhi. The service was good as the air hosts managed to handle difficult situations regarding few passengers. But there is room for improvement in the conditions of the washroom and facilities provided like availability of cushions or blankets.

### "disappointed by SpiceJet"
Mumbai to Jaipur. Really disappointed by SpiceJet. I reach at the airport and the moment I receive my boarding pass I get to know it's 2 hrs delayed. Usually with other airlines we get messages so much in advance and here it's all at the last moment - then staff does not have the courtesy to inform or apologize. Interesting.

### "Pathetic customer service"
Dubai to Coimbatore via Mumbai. Airline lost my luggage and not responding to my complaints. Customer care Supervisor promises a call back and never did. Launched 2 complaints with no answer. Customer care says we are sorry. Pathetic customer service and this lost luggage has created more issues for me.

### "seat broken - wouldn’t recline"
An international flight is supposed to be of international standards. Unfortunately our flight today from Hong Kong to Delhi was late, seat broken - wouldn’t recline. No inflight entertainment (inspite of a provision), seat covers torn  Cup holder broken. Bathroom dirty with no tissue n soap. Wouldn’t like to travel again by SpiceJet international and it’s not a cheap airline. Only good thing about the flight was the staff.

### "pay for my laptop bag weight"
Not Verified |  Pledged not to use SpiceJet ever again, did a mistake. July 19th - SG 732, boarded at Patna Airport, had two 16 kg checkin bag and 9 kg carry on bag when we weigh our bags at the airport. I agreed to pay for the extras even we weigh few kgs less at home. No hassle. Then I was asked to pay for my laptop bag weight as well, which was unjustifiable. Never ever I paid for my laptop bag as an extra carry on bag in last 10 years. No other flights charge such an extra bag fee. I agreed to pay for the laptop bag as well, but asked the spicejet staff their IDs which they declined to provide, they get all our information and unwilling to provide their IDs, which would help me to complain against them. Our co-passengers were too carrying carry on bag above 10 kgs, but we're singled out.

### "Worst aircraft and service"
Worst aircraft and service with SpiceJet. 12 hrs delay and finally cancelled the flight. Rude ground staff, and staff were not willing to accommodate the passengers on the next flight. Reached the airport at 6.30 pm for the flight 605 departing at 8.50 pm, initially announced a 1 hr delay, then 3 hrs, then 1 hours, then been informed an early morning flight of 6 am. They waited until the passengers forcefully cancelled their tickets in order to minimize their refund @ 500 rs per hours. Total loss incurred us in terms of rebooking, hotel stay and taxi was around 20000 INR + we couldn't attend a marriage of my brother.

### "don't choose SpiceJet"
Hyderabad to Shirdi. First of all, we were put in the plane 20 minutes late, before waiting on the tarmac, in a hot plane, for well over an hour. Once we finally took off, the onboard service was okay. I didn't buy anything since I had ate at the airport however, so I cannot comment about the food. On my return flight back to Hyderabad, I was put on an older Dash-8, which meant smaller seats, no reclining, and harder everything. Before/after this flight, I flew on IndiGo's ATR-72 from Tirupati to Hyderabad, which was so much better. If you want a cheap flight in India, don't choose SpiceJet, choose IndiGo, or even Air Asia India. Sometimes, Air India will be the cheapest option, which is a total win for me on a domestic flight, but not so internationally. I am unfortunately flying SpiceJet's 737 later this month, I'm just hoping that the entertainment streaming will save my sanity.

### "Excellent in-flight service"
Kolkata to Dhaka. Excellent in-flight service with tasty food, comfortable seating. Landed before time. Spicejet has made improvement since the last couple of years. On board I was surprised by the smooth and kind service by Both the crew. The app works, the web site works and the level of service is  above most.

### "poor customer service"
Jaisalmer to Ahmedabad. Worst experience with an airline so far. Travelled from a Jaisalmer and we were told that the flight would be delayed by 1h then ended up being delayed by around 3h. As a result of that, we missed our connection at Ahmedabad which was reasonably spaced at 3h from us landing. Upon landing we went to SpiceJet kiosk and staff was incredibly unhelpful telling us we need to buy new tickets to our destination. We ended up outside the airport, not being able to go back in arrivals or go into departures as we did not have a boarding ticket. We now need to wait for 4h until something is sorted by our insurance, in the heat, without water, food or toilets and with no help whatsoever from Spicejet. Poor airline with poor customer service. Incredibly unreliable

### "the worst experience"
Dubai to Jaipur. Poor airline,  I travel two times, the worst experience. First time flight was delayed 7hrs on 6th may from Dubai to Jaipur, no one the counter to advise further, Today check in staff stopped me to check my credit card, fine the approach was very unprofessional of the manager. Not explaining anything at same time dealing with some else over the phone. Spicejet needs to look after the customer service for enhancing the customer satisfaction!

### "no customer service"
Not Verified |  Pune to Ahmadabad. Very poor support. The flight got delayed by almost 5 hours. During the time of delay, no customer service provided by airline. The reason for delay is also unexplained. Approach towards customer satisfaction is at level zero. The AC duct was also damaged in the cabin, we cannot adjust the temperature.

### "The worst service ever"
Not Verified |  Ahmedabad to Delhi. The worst service ever. Flight was supposed to take off at 6 am but till 9:30 am we were clueless. No information provided by Airline. It is really unprofessional and irresponsible behaviour. This can not be accepted anywhere in service industries. Worst experience ever. Will never take this airline for any of my future needs.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Bangalore to Kolkata. Very comfortable ride and a good meal. Used to think that SpiceJet was not meant for business and corporate travellers. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The leg space was plenty and the meal was refreshing. Departure and Arrival times were alright give or take a few minutes. Would recommend to other corporate travellers.

### "a delay of 4 hours"
Bangalore to Pune. Worst airline ever, facing a delay of 3.5 hours. My meal which I booked is useless. And the worst part is the response which I received from the airline when I called up and asked an alternative. They replied saying that I have two options - I can cancel the flight and choose other airline, or I can wait for the delayed flight to board.

### "crew made our travel so comfortable"
Hyderabad to Delhi. Seats 1D and F later changed to 1A and C due to extra legroom. Efficient check-in, escorted from check-in counter till the lounge by SpiceBiz staff. Went through private security and was in the lounge in under 3 minutes. Boarding was through buses. Upon boarding, a choice of lime water or coconut water was given followed by cold towels. In the seat pocket, reading materials of newspapers and some magazines were present along with a small water bottle. Flight crew were super attentive and looked after us really well. H After take off, menu cards were handed out, which is great for a short 2 hour flight to Delhi. Lots of options to choose from and their dessert Tiramisu was extraordinary. After finishing of the meals, choice of tea and coffee was made along with choco-chip cookies. Good coffee! Finally, before landing a hot towel service. Overall, a great service in SpiceBiz, looking forward to my next travel with the same again. The crew made our travel so comfortable and constantly kept looking after us onboard. SpiceBIZ is a great addition to the airline and it’s a unique experience in itself.

### "never take Spicejet again"
Mumbai to Goa. 2 hours delay. Check in process delay. We were standing at the gate not knowing when they would open the gate, even though it was after the planner check in time. They opened the gate after 30 mins of planned time. Air hostesses looked super tired and was serving a bad service. I will never take Spicejet again.

### "it was a good experience"
Mumbai to Kolkata. I took an early morning flight and was in a big group we had some elderly people. The entire staff was friendly. The check in was seamless and very courteous staff guided us politely. The flight was also reasonably good with clean decor. Overall it was a good experience.

### "no improvement in service"
Madurai to Dubai. I have multiple times traveled with Spicejet, there is no improvement in service. Each trip is delaying and no delay information is communicated with passengers, Cabin crew aso not responding well with passengers, they fail to serve the basic requirement, even the announcement also not understandable and unclear. Still I am using Spicejet for traveling to Madurai because there is no alternative service available. Please try to improve your operation system

### "Never recommend to fly spicejet"
Bhopal to Trivandrum via Mumbai. First flight got delayed by 1 hr 35 min. And later departure time changed to 4:30 instead of 2:55. There is no proper reason from SpiceJet staff why flight is getting delayed - earlier they told departure time 4:10 then said 4:30 and actually flight took off at around 5 AM. Due to this delay, I missed my flight from Mumbai to Bhopal. I complained to spicejet by email but they just say due to operational reasons it got delayed and no compensation can be provided at all. After few email exchanges they don't even bother about customers' concerns. I found their cabin crew is also rude and does not know how to treat their customers in flight. Never recommend anyone to fly in spicejet unless there is emergency and no other option. Better to pay little more in other airlines but at-least you will reach your destination on time and have peach of mind.

### "experience was very bad"
Terrible airline. Flights are delayed and I was not informed of the delay over email or message. I figured only during the web check-in process. Seats in the aircraft were old, dirty and torn. Overall experience was very bad. Would not recommend this airline to anyone. So my overall experience was very bad.

### "Extremely cramped seats"
Bangalore to Delhi. Extremely cramped seats, even for a person of my height (5). And seats are dirty, too. No kind of effort seems to have been put into maintenance. I understand that this is a low budget flight, and we can't expect much leg space, but the amount of space between seats is painfully little, for more than an hour of journey. If you compare this with other low budget flights like Indigo, their spacing is much better.

### "last time I will fly Spicejet"
Delhi to Mumbai. Pathetic and irresponsible. Not at all recommended. Touch down at 8:40 pm and still waiting in the Aircraft for the doors to open (9:15 pm). Message from the cockpit that there is a technical issue and doors can't open. This is the last time I will be flying Spicejet and would never recommend Spicejet to anyone

### "avoid to use this airline in future"
I travelled on 1st June from Spice Jet flight SG014 from Dubai to Mumbai. SpiceJet offloaded our luggage without even updating the passengers. There was no attendant on Mumbai Airport to address the issue. Almost 70 baggage were offloaded due to overloading of flight reason. Then we were stranded at airport for almost 3hrs, the representative was arrogant, irresponsible and incompetent to even manage the issue. Today after 3 days there is no update on my luggage. Spice Jet is not only a low cost airline, i guess its also a low or no Service airline as well. I will surely make to avoid to use this airline in future. There has to be some system in place to take strict action on such irresponsible behaviour of the airline staff. We understand there will be issues, but managing them professionally and updating the customer about them should be their priority.

### "not recommend Spicejet"
Pune to Chennai. The worst flight experience, First the flight was delayed, then in midnight the flight landed on Chennai airport , from where I had connecting flight for KL. As the flight got delayed my layover time was full exhausted. They were very late in luggage delivery, intact no help for the enquiry of the same, because of which my international flight got missed. Will not recommend Spicejet to be taken in connecting flights. They are least bothered about the customers and their issues .

### "Very worst service"
Madurai to Chennai. Very worst service; I didn't get even a glass of water. All went well, but the service staff didn't bother me and they didn't reach me when I press the cabin assists button

### "staff could do absolutely nothing"
Bangkok to Mumbai via Delhi. Definitely the worst airline I've flown in the past 10 years. I took 4 flights in the last 7 days and all of them were delayed by 4-6 hours. I wasted multiple hotel reservations. I was verbally threatened by an intoxicated man on board and the staff could do absolutely nothing to assist or resolve the issue. My first and my last with this failing airline. Will make sure to spread the word.

### "Each delay for 3-4 hours"
Delhi to Bangkok delayed by 4hrs 50 mins, This has got to be one of the worst airlines. I took 4 flights in the last 7 days between Bangkok, Kolkata, Mumbai, and Delhi to Bangkok. None of the 4 flights were on time. Each delay were for 3-4 hours. Above and beyond all of this, crews are arrogant.

### "No info given to passengers"
Bengaluru to Ahmedabad. I had my flight scheduled at 7pm 16th May 2019. I reached the airport at 16.30, as it was far from my place. Without any calls or any message I got the information at the counter that the flight has been rescheduled for 1:10 am. I had to wait for 8.30 hrs. Worst was more that they boarded us at 1.30 am on 17th may 2019 and the aircraft flew at 2am. No info is given to the passengers on email nor on phone.

### "the flight got delayed"
Chennai to Madurai. I booked 9.50am flight as I wanted to reach Madurai before 1pm. And I received a message that the flight got delayed to 11.40am due to the operational issues. Now again the schedule got pushed to 12.10. I spoke to one of the SpiceJet officer in charge and he confirmed that affected passengers will be compensated with "Samosa Cake and a drink". I wrote to SpiceJet as well, but they are not really mindful about customer's discomfort.

### "would not recommend it"
I book a trip from Delhi to Hong-Kong and same to come back. Both planes were delayed by more than two hours. On top of it, you get an email 2h 30 before your flight that it is going to be delayed... Maybe a bit late don't you think ? And no clear information about any compensation for the delay. I would not recommend it. Pay a little more but at least you will be on time.

### "would recommend Spicejet"
Amritsar to Dubai. Had a huge and great family vacation with my joint family. I'm glad we took the Spicemax premium economy service as then we got more legroom. My child was crying in the flight and so the cabin staff did come to try and calm her down. It was very sweet of them. I would recommend Spicejet, especially if you're on a budget and looking for good quality services. I would add that the meal was also decent. Not too great though.

### "overall experience was pleasant"
Adampur to Delhi with SpiceJet. Was traveling on some business and the company had booked through Yatra. While it doesn't usually matter to me which flight/airline I take as the travel is for a particular purpose, I would rate the overall experience as a pleasant one. The cucumber, tomato and cheese sandwich on the multigrain bread loaf was also tasty.

### "Flight was fine"
Varanasi to Hyderabad. Flight was fine. I did not face a major problem. In hindsight if food could have been given I would have enjoyed the flight more. However since it was a short route I can understand why they did not. I would not mind traveling Spicejet again.

### "cabin staff were polite"
Vishakhapatnam to Hyderabad. I had a pleasant flight with Spicejet. The cabin staff were polite and so was the overall crew from the airport to the flight itself. The flight left relatively on time and was short and sweet. I would recommend it to others.

### "had the worst experience"
Dubai to Calicut. I had the worst experience with spicejet. First of all the changed the timing from 4:15pm to 7:20pm, and upon checking when we asked they told us the flight was again delayed and will be flying at 8:50pm. Upon reaching Kozhikode we came to know that none of our luggage were send from Dubai, which is absolutely irresponsible and the worst thing. And the help desk counter in Calicut was the worst. I would never ever fly with spicejet again.

### "Cabin crew completely ignored me"
Flew Pune to Bangalore with SpiceJet. Very unhappy with this company, took two flights, thinking that first time was just a coincidence. It wasnt. Cabin crew completely ignored me on both occasions, even when directly addressed. Didnt get any water (was ready to pay). The meal distribution system is very chaotic and basically those who did not pre-order dont get served. Also check in system is very archaic for foreigners.

### "pathetically poor service"
Originally we booked 7:30 am direct flight from Ahmedabad to Varanasi before 1 month from actual journey date. Just week before our journey we come to know that our flight got cancelled and alternate flight is given. I. E. 5:30 am from Ahmadabad to Mumbai and 12:30 pm from Mumbai to Varanasi but once we reached Mumbai at 7 am. We come to know that 12:30 pm flight was delayed for 3 hours. At 2 pm we come to know that another delay for 1 hour. At 3 we come to know thar it will be departed probably at 5 pm. At present its 3:50 pm and its still under suspense. Hotel booking of Varanasi hotel for today is totally wasted and we are sitting nearly 10 hours with 2 yr old child. Spicejet staff and its policies are careless towards customers. Will never use again, pathetically poor service..

### "They have to change their service"
Really bad experience with SpiceJet. I was traveling Mangalore to Dubai, the flight was delayed for five hours. First they sent the message that the flight is delayed for 2 hours. After reaching the airport again they sent a message, the flight is delayed for 2 hours. When boarding time comes they message came that flight is delayed. Inflight they didn't even offer water. I paid Rupees 32000 for one way and they can't even provide water. Other flights are serving free food and beverages but they never serve free food and beverages after charging high prices for ticket. I will never recommend this flight unless it is an emergency. They have to change their service.

### "level of confidence and assurance"
I was flying from Hyderabad to New Delhi on spice-jet Flight No SG 126 on 27th April 2019. During the security check I forgot to collect my laptop from the tray and went to the boarding gates. just 30 mins before the flight time i realize that my hand baggage is light and recognize that I forget the laptop at the security counter. I asked support from the spicejet security staff. They ask to go and check with the CISF and send Spicejet staff)with me. But the Lost and found store was locked. My laptop was very important to me I was ready to left my flight and wait for next morning , get my laptop and take another flight. But staff said me that he shall take full responsibility and will collect it on my behalf and will send it next day. By his level of confidence and assurance i got convinced and boarded my flight. This spicejet guy did all the formalities and send it to me next day. After 24 hours I got my laptop in Delhi. I solute the dedication spice-jet staff to their work. I am very thankful to M Akshay.

### "The last flight with Spicejet"
Patna to Ahmedabad. Flight delayed from Std 2.15 to 3.00 pm. Boarding finally started at 3.45, it did not take off until 5 pm. Reason was explained at 4.40 pm quoting "there are combination of errors, excess weight of plane, high temperature, 41 deg at patna and short runway". Just before take off at 5.10, pilot surprisingly made an announcement that if passengers are ready i can take off. The last flight with Spicejet for sure.

### "had a pathetic experience"
Mumbai to Chennai via New Delhi. I had a pathetic experience with the airline while travelling from Mumbai to Chennai. The flight was scheduled for 10:50 pm and got delayed for more than 3 hours. The reschedule communication wasn't done as a courtesy nor was there an apology or any lounge/food given to the passengers. If this is the way customers are treated, SpiceJet will soon be in line of bankruptcy after Jet Airways.

### "not recommend to anyone"
Delhi to Dhaka via Kolkata. Spice Jet is famous for delays and they make sure that they publish a delay of below 2hours so that they avoid any customer service as for more than 2 hours delay they would have to oblige under Govt law to provide refreshments or change flights. My flight from Kolkata to Dhaka is delayed by 1hr 50mins as claimed by Spice Jet I am sitting at the Kolkata airport and there is no staff presence. They fooled me to buy Spice max for privileged services, but it has been pathetic so far.. I had to call for a SpiceJet staff after i cleared my security and lady who came after 20mins could not take any decision and just said that we only provide the delay information and cant offer anything more. Will never take the option of Spice Jet and also not recommend to anyone.

### "try to avoid SpiceJet"
I booked tickets to return from Ahmedabad to Hyderabad, departure at 2:35 pm and arrival at 4:15 pm. SpiceJet changed the service time to 9:00 pm but didn't bother to call or send an SMS. I bought the tickets through Makemytrip and there was no update in the timing of the boarding pass i.e. share online by SpiceJet that they have shared from the email ID. This shows the recklessness of SpeceJet. It's recommended that try to avoid SpiceJet in India.

### "don't opt for SpiceJet"
The ground staff cunningly convinced us to upgrade our seats to SpiceMax with the promises of complimentary meals, priority boarding, and luggage delivery. None of these promises were met: priority boarding was denied, one meal for the price of two upgrades, and we collected our luggage from the belt, just like we would had we not had an upgrade. Bottom line: if you have the option, don't opt for SpiceJet. And never, ever fall for an upgrade.

### "terrible journey for us"
We have booked a ticket for our family (4 members) from Mumbai to Chennai at 10:50 pm through SpiceJet. We reached 3 hours before Mumbai Airport, but boarding not done because after one hour later only we came to know the flight was 3 hours delayed. After one hour later, we had prompted for boarding and nobody properly answered and replied for this incident. The flight was took off at 2 o'clock midnight and reached at chennai 4:00 am. We had collected our luggage and reached at 4:20 am at Indigo boarding counter, they had rejected to boarding because the counter was closed at 4:10 am, so that we have lost InDigo flight ticket money 10,000 for four members in Indigo travel. We could not pick up another because there was no seat available in all flights after that next day afternoon only seat was available. We are dumped at that situation with my kids and luggages. Nobody was given care for the customers. We have paid money, but no one was given proper arrangement and care. It made very terrible journey for us.

### "was an unfortunate incident"
Mumbai to Dubai. Boarded the flight at 10.30 and were in the aircraft till 2.30 when we finally took off. Little to no air-conditioning. Closed aircraft doors. Who ever was making the announcements  had no clue what was going on and it was like a "I really don't care" announcement. Rude cabin crew - to be fair, the one lady was, the other 2 ladies were really nice and tried their best. The seat in row ahead of me did not lock in place and was faulty and never returned to upright position during the trip. The final announcement was the best when we finally attempted take off at 2.30 "we apologise for the mismanagement by our company". It was an unfortunate incident that no one had control over.

### "Hassle free flight"
Varanasi to Jaipur. First Indian low cost flight I have taken, It's over my expectation. Hassle free flight. The plane departed on time and landed smoothly. No food and drink provided. Seat is ok. Couldn't see flight attendant during the flight. As a low-cost airlines I am satisfied with it. Ground service is good. I approach the airport 40 minutes before the flight. The staff is able to give me the correct instruction for check in. The luggage security check is carried out before check-in.

### "horrendous service"
Mumbai to Hyderabad. Absolutely horrendous service by SpiceJet, not good service on the plane and when we got off the plane we see our suitcase has come back with the front sliced open, when alerting the spicejet officer at Hyderabad airport his response was "how do I know that you didn't just do this". What sort of customer service is this? Blaming the customer? He then proceeded to waste 30 minutes of my time saying it will take 2, then when alerting him again, he proceeded to waste another 15 minutes basically doing nothing, it's just absolutely horrendous, I would not recommend flying with SpiceJet.

### "irresponsible service"
Delhi to Bagdogra. So irresponsible service from spicejet. Not helping in extreme emergency not recommended to use. If you use it Spicejet will divide your family and not offer any help after that.

### "Spicejet ruined all my plans"
I took Spicejet from Mumbai to Cochin 23/03/2018 morning. My luggage was suspended in Mumbai airport and later I found that the reason was that I had a power bank inside my luggage. Spicejet said that they tried to call me but couldn’t get through as my no was an international one. They knew I had a UK no and Obviously anyone knows that they should have dialed 0044 before dialing my no? I checked in about 7:40 and there was plenty of time for them to inform me prior to taking off. Why didn’t they use the communication speaker sound system to call my name? I travelled all the way from the UK and Spicejet has managed to destroy my stay, why? I phoned the extremely unhelpful “helpline “some 5 times but they acted very unprofessional and were not helpful the slightest. I had all my very necessary belongings including my medicines in the luggage. There was no information anywhere re. Power bank restriction. The check in staff could easily have either phoned me or called me through the airport speaking sound system. The Mumbai staff could have phoned the Cochin staff and informed them that my luggage was suspended in Mumbai rather than leaving me anxiously waiting for my luggage which never arrived. Spicejet staff could have been helpful and send my luggage to Cochin airport the same day. 5“Helpline” extremely Unhelpful at all times and never called me back for update. 6Finally when my luggage was sent to Cochin 3 very long and troublesome days later, my power bank was not in there. They could have easily put the power bank in the aircraft cabin. Spicejet said that they disposed of the power bank? My power was fairly new costed me £50 so surely someone is using it now. Spicejet didn’t have the courtesy to send my luggage from Cochin to the Ayurveda Hospital I’m staying at. Spicejet ruined all my plans.

### "value for money trip"
My flight from Bengaluru to Delhi a value for money trip. This airline could be value for money, a good budget airline. Good supporting cabin crew, hassle free online booking no delay in flight.

### "Another good flight"
Mumbai to Delhi. Another good flight from Mumbai to Delhi on board service was fast and excellent. Seats are comfortable, cabin crew is also supportive as they help me to put my luggage.

### SpiceJet customer review
Flight to Kolkata with Spicejet and return back to Delhi was the best. Comfortable and fast option. For my next flight to Kolkata I will for sure choose this Airline.

### "welcomed us with a smile"
Delhi to Kolkata with SpiceJet. I want to admit that I am not interested in writing reviews but after this flight I was surprised and impressed so that's why I am adding my review because they deserve the same. When we entered the aircraft they welcomed us with a smile, seats and plane were cleaned and looking good. Food and drink was also good and tasty.

### "a good comfortable flight"
Business flight with SpiceJet to Chennai from Mumbai Airport, decent support, and flight crew members are also friendly and well trained to deal with there passengers. Overall a good comfortable flight journey.

### "comfortable journey"
Flight from Delhi to Kolkata a good and comfortable journey. This one was not my first flight i also traveled previously by another Airline in economy class. If i compare with other one this one was batter then my previous flight experiences.

### "worst flight experience"
Pune to Hyderabad. The worst flight experience till now. I would never recommend it to anyone. Both my flights were delayed. We book flights because we should reach early and on time. The flight from Hyderabad to pune was suppose to leave at 11 pm and left almost around 1:45 am. Same was the case with pune to hyderabad where my flight got delayed for 3 hrs. All passengers were complaining about the service of Spicejet. Everyone was saying it is always the same in Spicejet.

### "experience was really good"
Hyderabad to Delhi. Very good supportive staff, on time, no problem faced, overall experience was really good. They are improving their service compared to previous trips, food taste was also good.

### "their service is the worst"
Hyderabad to Ahmedabad via Bhopal. Worst airline ever. Twice in a row, my flight got canceled and made me sit on connecting flight which took 08 hours. And that their service is the worst I have seen from cabin crew to the call attendees at customer care.

### "a good flight experience"
I had never heard of SpiceJet before flying from Hyderabd to Delhi in January month. I was just surprised. Left more or less on time, arrived fairly on time, seats are very comfortable, pleasant service. Crew, staff and service was also excellent. Overall a good flight experience.

### "Will never fly Spicejet"
Kolkata to Delhi. I travelled with my family and were on seats 12 A, 12B, 12C and 12D. The row in front of us kept their seats reclined back all through out. We pointed it out thrice before take off that the passengers need to follow the rules of straightening the seat back u during take off and landing. The cabin crew refused to ask the passengers to comply. Instead they asked my children to relocate to another seat that they said had more leg space. This is inexplicable. Since my daughter was having a tough time sitting in the seats that already have reduced leg space compared to other airlines, my 13 year daughter and 10 year son moved to seats 3A and 3B. Needless to say, these seats dis not have any extra leg space and the cabin crew was lying. On landing, we checked if the row of seats in front of us had any problem in straightening the back and they were all fine and could be straightened. Will never fly Spicejet after this experience

### "Worst customer service"
Bangkok to Amritsar. Worst customer service. Not helpful, wrong information and attitude. You have to make a scene to get anything done with this airline and frankly they don’t give a shit. Please do not fly with them. Pay a little more and go with someone else.

### "Worst experience ever"
Flew Madurai to Chennai with SpiceJet. Worst airline ever. Always delayed. Poor quality of aircraft. Staff are extremely rude. Will not fly ever again and not recommend. Worst experience ever.

### "spicemax at a good price"
Not Verified |  I flew from Dubai to Kozhikode on 15th Feb. I had already paid for my seats etc for me and the family. At the checkin counter in Dubai airport, one of the staff approached me saying that he can offer me spicemax at a good price that includes extra leg room and free food. I said No initially - but then he said if i pay him 135AED , he can get this for 3 people. The term he used was "buy 1 get 2 free". I was tempted and made that payment. I entered the plane and got the second row. With the food option, the hostess asked me chicken or Veg, i said 1 chicken rest veg. She gave one sandwich and 2 chicken options and asked me to pay 60 AED. I asked why and she said that only the seats are included. I was not carrying cash and my wife was not carrying her wallet. I gave her my card and she said they dont accept. When i asked her - first of all , you didnt tell me that this is chargeable and secondly, you never told me that you accept only cash. She asked me to borrow money from some other passenger which i declined. After that what she said was horrifying "Its a shame that you are coming from Dubai with family and you dont carry any cash".

### "my last travel with SpiceJet"
Delhi to Bangalore. I did mistake of doing a corporate travel booking via SpiceJet. Had an important dinner meeting at BLR and booked 4.40 pm flight which was 8K costlier then the other flights available Initially SpiceJet delayed flight by some 30 min, which was OK looking at Indian standards. However once we were in cabin , they came up with an excuse of water leakage and delayed the flight by 2 hrs. Overall impact of this was that Missed an important business meeting. This was my last travel with SpiceJet and I would be careful in bookings next time.

### "pay for an excess of 2kgs"
Bengaluru to Pune. SpiceJet is the worst airline in India. The line for check-in was 1 hour long! In short, for a domestic flight, you would have to reach before you are required to reach for an international flight. In Bengaluru SpiceJet counter, you can meet the most incompetent ground staff. Despite the long line, they were more interested in finding the tiniest fault possible and charging outrageous amounts as excess baggage. This was the first time that I had been asked to pay for an excess of 2kgs and Rupees 800 for the same. The lady at the check-in counter would rather let me go and repack with the line waiting behind me, than just wave off the matter and check me in.

### "SpiceJet is unapologetic"
Ahmedabad to Hyderabad via New Delhi. This is my 4th consecutive flight with SpiceJet that has got delayed. It's a hassle to rearrange my entire travel plan or wait extra hours in the airport. SpiceJet is unapologetic about it. For me, this is the last time I'll be flying SpiceJet.

### "Worst flight experience"
Kanpur to Delhi. Worst flight experience ever. The ground staff was very non cooperative, the handbag was asked to be put in checkin to earn money. The low carrier airline tag is just a ruse to fetch money from people by charging them with things like your baggage is 57cm and not 55cm - airbag with wheels is not allowed. With 2 tickets our checkin baggage was within the limit but because they added our hand baggage to Our checkin we were asked to pay extra- and they charge a hefty amount of 400Rs per kg. The rest of the Journey was made worse by the under construction Kanpur airport, they have limited staff and faulty equipment which makes the passenger experience a terrible ordeal.

### "Worst experience"
Bengaluru to Delhi. Worst experience. Travelled several times Indigo but never faced issue. Spicejet is not at all customer friendly. Rude tone of staff. Not managed properly. Seriously in my life no one I know will book Spicejet again.

### "do this re-scheduling a lot"
Mangalore to Bangalore. The flight was originally scheduled at 7.35 PM and got postponed to 9.15 PM a week before the scheduled date. And looks like they do this re-scheduling a lot. Why have so many itineraries to select from while booking if you actually cannot run those? I called up the Customer Care and requested to change the flight to 5.40 PM which is available, just so that the risk of missing the connecting flight is less. But I was told about the policies and stuff that I have to pay the Ticket Fare + Change Penalty if I have to get it changed. Seriously guys!? is this what you call customer service? The flight is re-scheduled by 15 Min less than 2 Hrs which is the minimum time interval required for the ticket to be rescheduled free of cost according to "Policy". When you say "Sorry, we regret the inconvenience caused", at least try to make up to the customer rather than making more money out of the customer's inconvenience.

### "flight delayed by 5 hours"
Not Verified |  Cochin to Chennai. Worst experience in flying. The flight was delayed by 5 hours and the crew had no information even about the time at which flight was rescheduled. They could have at least informed in advance so that I could have opted for another flight. Even though they know about the matter they kept mum. Never opt for this flight.

### "bad and worst experience"
Bangalore to Hyderabad. Worst experience. No proper response from the SpiceJet team. In the check in queue all not sending passengers in queue . Least bothered staff. Also flight got delayed by 30 mins but no information until asked. When I went and asked they are telling like we updated in the board but they updated the time I asked. Unprofessional people. Really very bad and worst experience.

### "really bad service"
Delhi to Bangkok. Good price but really bad service. They did not carry enough water bottles for all the passengers. In fact, they did not even have much food or other beverage options for customers on the later rows of the plane. They had one bottle of water for 10 rows at the back. Had to call the attendant multiple times to get anything at all. Seats were ok, not too bad. The flight was also hot since the AC wasn't too effective. Only use as last resort if you don't have other flight options available. Much better to pay more for other airlines.

### "worst airline company"
Guwahati to Pakyong. Spicejet is the worst airline company. They cancel flights when they could not sell there full tickets and blame the cancellation to bad weather condition. They do not have the decency to inform the passengers beforehand so that they can arrange for an alternative. You will know about the cancellation at airport. Thereafter you will have to run to Spicejet office and request them to refund your money.

### "always a delay"
Not Verified | Jaipur to Varanasi. Consistent airline - always a delay! I have an experience of delay in all trips while travelling with Spicejet. It takes something to be so consistent in wasting the passengers time. The ground staff is arrogant while addressing the issue. They are obviously obliging you by providing you the airlines although the flight attendants are courteous. Need to learn to be punctual and timely intimating the passengers about the delay.

### "ticket without check in baggage"
Kolkata to Silchar. Spicejet should start begging on the road holding a bowl, instead of flying aeroplanes. I was issued a ticket without check in baggage. I was carrying a laptop bag and another small bag. Seeing this 2 bags spicejet charged me Rs 400/- extra.

### "improve before its too late"
Coimbatore to Delhi. Improve before its too late. I don’t usually do this but the reason for writing this review is manifold. Firstly, the delay in flight time owing to poor weather conditions, its hard to comprehend how other airlines can operate on time in similar conditions. I just hope the delay was not caused to the airline staff. Secondly, if flight is delayed then the same can be conveyed well in advance to avoid any inconvenience to a lady travelling with a toddler. Thirdly, this really tested my patience, the rude and indifferent behaviour of the lady at the counter at Coimbatore airport. She was not not considerate enough to check in the hand baggage meant for the baby and insisted that the same should be caaried in cabin. I wonder if its the AUW that counts and other airlines can consider, why same thing could not be replicated by the Spice jet. Overall, it was a nightmare and a horrible experience. I wish I didn't have to travel this airline again. For you own sake, improve before its too late.

### "Please improve your service"
Kolkata to Chennai. Flight delayed by 1.5 hrs and notification of delay provided 1.5 before check in. This is third time Spicejet is cancelling it's flight due to operational reasons in last 2 months of my travel. Please improve your service.

### "a very rude behaviour"
Delhi to Guwahati. They destroyed a super wonderful journey of mine. They charged a huge amount of money for a little extra luggage and in spite of repeatedly informing them about fragile luggage they destroyed my belongings. No other flights had any problem with the on the cabin luggage including international airlines. Spicejet had a very rude behaviour. Never ever board this flight. Worst experience ever.

### "not at all customer friendly"
Mumbai to Visakhapatnam via Hyderabad. Spicejet not at all customer friendly, charging 400 INR/ kg for extra baggage is too much. I paid 4000 rs for extra 10 kg which is equal to my flight ticket cost. And the interesting part was when I go by other airlines with same luggage travelled smoothly, but with Spicejet scenorio is different, think twice before going.

### "overall service is very poor"
Mumbai to Hubli. Spicejet counter staff is very irresponsible. Laptop bag is allowed extra in all airlines. But Spicejet airline counts laptop weight in baggage. Also overall service is very poor.

### "won't recommend SpiceJet"
Hyderabad to Guwahati. Cannot adjust the seat and less space. The seats are comfortable for casual passenger. I lost my peace in SpiceJet. I will never again travel through SpiceJet. And won't recommend people to travel with SpiceJet.

### "unprofessional staff"
Delhi to Jammu. Will never fly this airline again. Very unprofessional staff. We were travelling with two kids coming from an international flight. They charged us for every gram in plus. Had to pay for the extra weight more than the actual ticket. Thieves! !

### "never recommend Spicejet"
Ahmedabad to Delhi . I am travel agent from Gandhinagar, Gujarat. I have recently travelled with my family first time with your company. It was worst of worst experience to fly with SpiceJet. On the airport Sign board only Spicejet flights were late, and due to the delayed flight we missed our Sightseeing and reached hotel very late! I dont understand why only Spicejet flight has many problems. I will never recommend Spicejet to all clients.

### "flight timing was changed"
Varanasi to Jaipur. The flight timing was changed without any information. I am an old lady and was waiting at the airport for more than 4 hours, without any assistance from the airline members. On asking why has the airline not informed, they gave me an excuse that sms to all members have been sent and it is not their responsibility, if I have not got the sms. No courtesy at all.

### "very helpful and friendly"
Chennai to Vijayawada. The excellent service you could never ask for, value for money! Specially, two cabin crew members are very helpful and friendly. I wish them all the best. Keeping doing this good service with smile.

### "No clear updates"
Took the flight for a one hour journey from Coimbatore to Chennai. It got delayed by close to 3 hours. No clear updates at the counters and no refreshments offered and the after all this when we boarded the aircraft, house keeping was bad. Will never take SpiceJet again

### "horrible experience"
Mumbai to Ahmedabad. Will never travel again. 3 hours flight was delayed very unprofessional work, horrible experience not worth the money I don’t recommend.

### "I won't recommend"
Not Verified |  Delhi to Madurai via Chennai. Very rare I'm using Spice jet. Last week I've booked Spice max. When I entered for Priority Check-in, the staff in that counter didn't allow me without ask me anything. Later I had check-in in normal counter, explained about this, they didn't even apologize. There is no Priority check-in. Food is average. Flight was around 1hr of delay. Finally no priority bag out. So guys, please don't book Spice max, They are just grabbing money from you. Its completely useless. I had very worst experience with Spice jet. I'm Gold member of Jet airways. Unfortunately I didn't get seat that day. I'll never come again Spice jet. I won't recommend to anyone.

### "will never travel again"
Mumbai to Dubai. Worst flight. I will never travel again. Charging for every thing giving such a costly ticket but without meal. Please be a domestic airline, don't go for international.

### "never recommend Spicejet"
Hubli to Hyderabad. Worst of the worst. They can’t operate as per schedule. My international flights and all the programs are rescheduled because of this airline. I will never recommend Spicejet airlines in my life!

### "experienced it overall as good"
Colombo to Goa via Chennai. All flights were on time and the airplanes were very new. I had only hand luggage. They really check the weight, so make sure you only bring 7 kilos or take something out before they weigh it. They only provide you one cup of free water (maybe you can ask for more), but it was no problem to bring my own little bottle of water. When your luggage get checked at the airport, they don't throw the bottle away. For food you have to pay and it seemed like they have only factory fabricated kind of food. But this was also no problem, as my flights were very short. The flight attendants were young girls and they were friendly. I experienced it overall as good.

### "they are so inefficient"
Jaipur to Goa via Ahmedabad . Save your money and don’t fly with them. 4.5 hours turned into 8.5 hrs. More time was spent waiting than actually in air flying. No communication was given as we were herded like sheep from one security point to the next. Initially the flight was late 1.5 hours. We flew to Ahmedabad which was 55 minutes. The same plane flight was to continue on to Goa. However it didn’t. Everyone continuing on to Goa was asked to stay seated and present their ticket. Ten minutes later another passenger informed us we had to change planes. We exited to a bus which took us out of the airport then back in- through security once again then made to wait an additional 2.5 hours. Originally to be in Goa at 4:10pm actual arrival 8:30pm. Not to mention their staff is terrible, no smiles, compassion, communication. I was shocked at how little we were told about what was going on. I thought Spicejet was a reputable company but they are so inefficient it’s ridiculous. They did off meal vouchers for the inconvenience. I would have preferred a customer service agent that didn’t stare blankly and say he accepted the situation but would do nothing to resolve it.

### "the worst experience"
Delhi to Pune. I travelled SpiceJet for the first time & this was the worst experience as compared to other airlines. They are charging for checkin bag, you can carry only hand bag - if your carrying checkin bag you have to pay for that as per the weight. In SpiceJet the seat arrangements are very compact as compared to other airlines, you can't stretch your legs properly. There will be no complementary food, you have to pay for food. The crew & airport staff don't know how to treat the customers, they are very rude.

### "the worst web site"
Pune to Dubai. I would mention here that their Web Site is the worst web site of all I have so far dealt with. Its not reliable at all. As we have limited options in that price range one has to deal with this issue all the time.

### "Spicejet is a very cheap"
Delhi to Guwhati. Sat on my seat and saw a used spoon and a knife left there in the magazing holder. I asked the staff to take it away to which she replied leave it there, I'll take it later. Actually, you should have taken it away even before you started boarding. Spicejet is a very cheap and fast way to travel but I guess that does not mean you can drop your standards that low, leaving dirty cutlery from the last passengers for the new ones. I am still paying big bucks.

### "It feels like hell"
Dubai to Cochin. Worst airline in the world. They charge all the cabin luggage. My cabin bag was 7kg when checking at home. SpiceJet says it is 7.4 kg, ask me to pay extra charge for 1 kg. Also they charge me extra for Duty free items purchased from airport. Safety belt hook was not working in my seat. Toilet are dirty and flush not working properly. Passage is too narrow, congested. Flight delay 40 minutes for take off without any reason. Delay of luggage on arrival. It feels like hell.

### "Never recommend"
New Delhi to Varanasi. Spicejet has turned out to be my worst flight experience till now. This is the only airline that thinks telling passengers about the flight delay is not necessary as they delay their flights daily. I was travelling to varanasi on 30/10/18 10.10 am flight and a had a same day return via IndiGo 6.30 pm flight. After reaching airport I got to know the flight is delayed by 3 hrs, I had received no message or email so I decided to postpone my trip to next day after paying 4k as penalty for rescheduling IndiGo to next day and guess what next - same story next day. Moral of the story is Spicejet sucks. Rating negative. Never recommend.

### "improve on time performance"
Guwahati to Chennai. SpiceJet can hardly be relied upon for punctuality. The thing to be noticed is that it is in major routes and also that the delays are huge whenever they happen. So if one has a connecting flight, train or bus, one has to keep fingers crossed. Risky. The airline needs to improve on time performance.

### "I have to buy a new ticket"
Chennai to Madurai. Extremely unhappy- I was told at 7:20 am that the doors had closed for a 7:50 am flight, for a 7:25am boarding time! Have no luggage at all, the counter sent me to ticketing and they just said that I have to buy a new ticket. Took the next flight after paying 5K for 9:50am and the gates to board haven’t opened at 9:45am. I have been warned by others that this is the worst of them all! Shame on you

### "The very worst airline"
Dubai to Mumbai. The very worst airline. They are calculating even the laptop weight also even though the flight is almost empty. I will consider not to use this airline in entire journey.

### "never travel SpiceJet again"
I booked a return ticket Mumbai to Delhi and now on my return journey they are using me to pay Rs. 400 more because on my return ticket they have printed "hand baggage fare only". This is a sly underhand way of extracting money from their customers. How is it possible this was not printed on my ticket from BOM-DEL? They are blaming IRCTC for this and saying don't book through IRCTC. Why are they selling tickets through 3rd parties? I am never going to travel with SpiceJet again.

### "you must pay for everything"
Flew Spicejet from Tirupati to Hyderabad as I travel for my holidays to SE Asia. Like many have said on this site, this is probably the worst Indian airline to travel with. In comparison with IndiGo or Vistara, nothing is free, you must pay for everything. The ticket price is not that cheap compared to other Indian airline, the story began when the flight was delayed for more than an hour without communication with us. After that, we boarded an old plane with nothing onboard - tight legroom, rude staff, A/C not working, toilet disgusting etc. Luckily, the flight was not that and was still able to made in to my flight at 10 pm to get on my flight to SE Asia via Dubai. My advice - don't travel on Spicejet if you can help. Try and fly another airline whenever possible.

### "The worst airline service"
Bangalore to Hyderabad. The worst airline service you, they will push you to buy all the additional services and charge you for the same but they will never deliver the services. When you ask for a refund or ask for an explanation why the services not provided, the support team will make you run in circle’s, Manager’s or supervisors will never come on the phone.

### "such issue for My hand bag"
Dubai to Mumbai. Hand Luggage : As per the policy 7 KG hand luggage was allowed . The crew made me pay for the laptop / purse / dutyfree purchases etc etc. My First time experience in 15 years of travelling. Never ever I have faced such issue for My hand bag. I had to pay AED 300 The flight was half empty.

### "had to pay for my baggage"
Mumbai to Delhi. Cheating customers by selling only cabin baggage only fare on one online travel site while other online travel site is selling at same price but 15kg allowance. I had to pay for my baggage in a domestic flight when I purchased a Hand Baggage Only fare. The leg space is so bad for even someone like me who is a girl of average height. Even the seat in front of me feels like on my face nor does my seat decline as it’s the seat before emergency exit.

### "Very disappointing"
We traveled Delhi to Dubai and vise versa. They did not even provide complimentary Water bottle Which they give in domestic travel. In flight Meal is very low quality and bad. they even take overweight charge for products bought from duty free shop which is free with other airlines this they did to make up for unsold tickets which we could make out when we boarded the plane. I am frequent international traveler but traveled with Spicejet for the first time I decided to travel with them due to my travel experience with them in domestic travel. Only positive is the in-flight staff which is good. Very disappointing Indian carrier of such level.

### "keep up the good work"
Bangalore to Pune. Spicejet is a very good airline and I reach my destination on time. This time I made a mistake by taking my sisters phone inside the airport and since I passed the security area, there was no way for me to physically hand over the phone. Spicejet staff was very courteous and caring and they helped me get the phone back to my sister. Kudos to the staff and please keep up the good work.

### "Don't ever go for Spicejet"
I had booked 8 tickets from Mumbai to Mangalore and return for next month and I paid around Rs. 28000 for flight bookings and now spicejet cancelled scheduled flights and now my important function is getting affected because of flight cancellation from Spicejet. I need to pay higher fare for flights booking of other airlines. This airline don't even bother to call once they cancel prebooked flights. Don't ever go for Spicejet.

### "Seat was not adjustable"
Dubai to Jaipur. I will say it's a worst experience ever to fly in spicejet this time. On our seat chewing gum was stuck. Seat was not adjustable the switch was damaged and when we informed they said will check no one comes after.

### "having technical problem"
Mangalore to Hyderabad. Third time to me this year their aircraft is having technical problem. Same issue always. A day delay is causing such a trauma to proms like me and business, student life getting effected. Will never fly in this again after today.

### "negative point is the seat"
Hyderabad to Delhi. I had only hand-baggage, so no interaction with ground staff,on previous occasions i have checked in with spicejet in HYD, a pleasant experience. It was a bus gate, the ride to the aircraft was smooth. Flight was delayed by almost 90 mins. Legroom on this aircraft is less and could have been more. The cabin crew is good and well trained, there was a small medical emergency which was handled well by the crew. This one was an older aircraft. Only negative point is the seat.

### "experience was terrible"
Bangkok to Delhi. My first experience with airline was terrible, my mistake that I booked the tickets. Air hostesses had attitude rather than respectful. I understood later after flying that its like a discounted purchase but it is still a paid service not free ride. My 2 cents, better training to match airlines like Thai and Swiss.

### "Good flight altogether"
Goa to Pune. Check in at Goa was smooth but the ground staff are not the friendliest. Flight was on time and boarding etc was perfect. Staff on board were very nice and friendly. They sell food on this 40 minute flight but ran out of most options by the time they reached me- and I was in row 7!! Anyway managed to give me a hot meal that I paid for and that was actually very tasty. Good flight altogether.

### "give something edible"
Bangalore to Delhi. Worst flight ever. I know flight food tastes bad but at least give something edible. I prebooked my meal for paneer tortilla but was served a cold hot dog bun filled with almost stale lettuce n some weird tasting cream. At least provide what I paid for.

### "should be proper information"
I travelled on SpiceJet flight with PNR YY19SM for SG 511 on 11 Jun 2018 (HYD-BLR: 1040-1155). The flight got delayed by more than 60 minutes and there was no information from your crew inspite of multiple requests. I had to be in Bangalore by 1 pm but due to the Flight delay I had missed the important meeting at the time which had affected my plans and had a worst day because of your services. There should be proper information update to the customers if in case of any delay, There is no apology or regret on this from crew end.

### "nice service"
Delhi to Surat. Nice service, good staff behaviour inflight. When I will come back to India I will choose this airline again. Flight was on-time and arrived into terminal 2 from Delhi just in front of internationl terminal which was very easy to reach.

### "disappointed with the service"
Jaipur to Hyderabad. Too bad experience, as my schedule is ruined. My flight was on 9.15 pm on 8th june, but in evening 4pm I received a notification about 1 hour delay. Then about 5pm I received another notification for 2 hours delay. Then about 6pm I received notification for 6 hour delay. Then 11pm I received notification for 8 hours, and then finally my flight departed on 6.52 am. It is late by near about 10 hours without proper information.. Really disappointed with the service.

### "really bad service"
Mumbai to Bangalore. Worst flight and service. Every time Spicejet delays flights by 1 hour. This time it's a 3 hour delay. They change the departure gate  3 times after I got the boarding pass. Now after completing all boarding they are changing the staff. SpiceJet has really bad service. Never travelling again with SpiceJet.

### "worst airline ever flown"
❌ Not Verified |  Bangkok to Mumbai via Kolkata. Without doubt the worst airline I have ever flown with. Late flights with no apologies, incredibly rude staff at the airport literally shouting at my friend and I. When we missed our connecting flight they questioned if we were stupid and offered no apology, and then made the most minimal of efforts to arrange a new flight for us - 9 hours later. The plane itself had problems with AC so it was a sweltering journey (with no water offered).

### "I will fly again"
Pune to Dubai. Departure and arrival on time. Checkin at Pune airport was quick. New aircraft and clean interior and toilets. I paid Rs 300 for chicken meal and was good. Low fare as one way cost me Rs 5500 incl tax $80 approx. with 30kgs checking and 7 kgs baggage. Seats were average. The  crew were very busy on the flight selling foods and beverages. One flight attendant seemed tired and frustrated and yelled at any passenger who called from service at times. I felt extra crew member or relaxed flight attended could have made the service better. No inflight entertainment. I will fly again. This airline has on time performance record and serves decent meals.

### "they never came back to me"
I was travelling from Hyderabad to Visakhapatnam and I asked for noodles using credit card option as I don’t have cash at that time. The crew said they'll check it out after they are done with cash as it takes some time and they never came back to me. It’s a pathetic situation and they should be in a way to at least convince people or satisfy the customers but none of it was done. The seats are very congested and the back extension is not working at all.

### "never fly SpiceJet again"
Bangkok to Delhi. The worst airline, first delayed for 2 hours then 4 hours and then almost 6 hours, when called customer service and they started being rude -  no courtesy to help the customer. Will never fly SpiceJet again.

### "quality of the service"
Bagdogra to Banglore, SpiceJet been my benchmark for Indian domestic flights (I haven't travelled abroad). A prime factor is the quality of the service provided by the air hostesses. The food and the hygiene maintained by the aircraft was excellent even though it would be lovely if more food was available at a lower price.

### "aggressive and disrespecting"
Varanasi to Goa via Hyderabad. They have worst cabin crew I've ever seen. Very aggressive and disrespecting. They have no manners to talk to someone. The air hostess was shouting at people for no apparent reason.

### "Pretty bad experience"
Patna to Mumbai. Pretty bad experience actually. My flight from Patna was delayed, so I missed my connecting international flight, I was not informed of the delay. I came to know when I reached the airport. Ground staff did not care about the stress we were under because of it with a 2 year old. Rude and unprofessional behavior. I think we should have been a priority because of the onward journey, they did not take any responsibility for it. We also had to pay extra for the luggage even when this was part of the deal with an international journey. Had to spend 2000 pounds to buy a new ticket over night after spending the night on the airport. Horrible customer care and no accountability.

### "pathetic service"
Goa to Pune. Pathetic service it was supposed to fly at 2pm its 2.30 pm and still they are boarding passengers. For what joy is this delay. Its too hot outside and their fans are too slow to cool the cabin. The worst.

### "so very disappointed"
Bangalore to Pune. Either their flight will be delayed or cancelled. I need to travel to attend a marriage and they delayed the flight by 4 Hrs. I am so very disappointed. They usually charge less as compared to other airlines but what’s the point when you can’t be on time!

### "I'm really disappointed"
I'm really disappointed by the services provided by Spicejet. We were travelling from Dubai to Amritsar on 21st April and had especially booked spicemax as we needed increased leg space and priority check in as we had an infant with us - but we were utterly disappointed when we got to know in the flight itself that there were no spicemax seats and the food my husband ordered was finished already. For all 4 of us the journey was disastrous and we were just fidgeting in the small seats and my son was irritated with congested space. We were not told by any of the staff nor did we receive any email regarding non-availablity of the spicemax seats. This didn't happen once but both ways we were travelling.

### "Spicejet is very arrogant"
Tirupati to Aurangabad via Hyderabad. SG-708 from Tirupati to Hyderabad all passengers got boarded into the flight and after 40min got a message like there is a technical problem where flight cannot move and and delayed for almost 2:30 hrs and I lost my connectivity flight from Hyderabad to Aurangabad. When u asked for help they said we are not bother about your connectivity airlines and we are not accountable for any delay. Spicejet is very arrogant in answering and helping the customers.

### "talking aggressively to passengers"
Ahmedabad to Bangalore. There can be delays occuring due to technical issues and its quite understandable. But not informing as an announcement and an apology, and staff just talking aggressively to passengers, cant be expected, when the fault or misfortune happened to customer by the service provider. Moreover, our flight time was 9:35, but it didnt depart from the gate as planned, but gate was changed, and people were running around not sure if they are heading towards correct direction. After all the hurdles, flight boarding completed and it started at around 11:30pm. I wont say that Spicejet is bad, but  their attitude without an apology for inconvenience has to be condemned.

### "charging for everything"
Kolkata to Dhaka. This was my first time on SpiceJet, a low-cost carrier -- though after paying for securing a seat, a snack, and to make the reservation -- the total price exceeded that of a full service operator! To secure my seat, I had to also pay for a snack! I chose the flight entirely because of its timing -- it was convenient for my plans. On the day prior to the departure I received a text message that the flight had been "preponed" by a hour because of runaway repairs at Dhaka. Appreciated this update. At the airport, SpiceJet's international counter opened about 90 minutes prior to the flight's departure. A man checked passports to determine if visa to Bangladesh was in order. He sat at a counter that said "Air India" - this confused some of us. The twin engine propeller plane was parked out on the tarmac and a bus ferried the passengers to it. The short flight was smooth though loud. Flight attendants were efficient. My vegetarian sandwich was dry; I needed to pay extra to get a water. Although the flight got me to my destination in reasonable comfort, the airline seems to focus on the mass market. The small plane did not have a first class cabin and its emphasis on charging for everything and anything whether you want it or not can be grating.

### "lack of concern to return change"
Kozhikode to Bangalore. I travelled with my 3 year old son where I bought a juice for my son on board. The price of juice was RS 70 where I paid RS100 (no change) and after landing I reminded her but the air hostess fumbled and stumbled. I am sorry to say given the standard of the airline there was lack of concern to return the change promptly I felt uneasy though it was not the best way to give change I opted to let go of it.

### "seats were very crammed"
Kolkata to Bangkok. Boarding was smooth. However, the seats were very crammed up and uncomfortable. The windows were dirty and  window shades didn't pull down. The crew was unprofessional. Even after landing, at Suvarnabhumi Airport, no cabin crew greeted us as we disembarked the aircraft.

### "rude cabin crew"
Flew Mumbai to Kolkata. Rude check-in staff, rude cabin crew, delayed flights, hopeless website. Website sneakily trying to sell you add on services which you can easily miss, you will pay through your nose if your luggage exceeds their weight even by a hundred grams. I can think of plenty more reasons to avoid this airline, but I don't have the whole day.

### "can carry only 7kgs of 1 bag"
Mumbai to Hyderabad. The staff is rude and non-cooperative. The rules of carrying luggage are misleading. You can carry only 7kgs of 1 bag or else you will be charged an exorbitant fee. Even if you are a family, you will be charged separately based on the individual baggage, which is  ridiculous. There is no justification provided but only hidden disclaimers. Forget hospitality even the basic services don't exist for passengers.

### "recommend you avoid this company"
We were booked to fly several SpiceJet flights in November 2017. One of these flights was a flight from Delhi to Goa. Shortly over a week before we were due to fly, SpiceJet notified us that the flight was cancelled due to a runway closure. Frustrating of course, but apparently out of their control, so we were initially understanding. What was in SpiceJet’s control however was the customer service experience that followed. To summarise what has been a truly horrendous experience spanning 3 months. SpiceJet could offer no alternative flight that day, so I we had to book an alternative flight at 3 x the price. Due to the cancelled flight being the 2nd leg of a connecting flight SpiceJet calculated the refund of the cancelled leg on an unfair ‘km by km basis’ rather than the price paid for each leg, leaving us out of pocket due to the 2nd leg being much more expensive. SpiceJet erroneously refunded only 1 passenger of the 2 on the cancelled leg, leaving us an additional 7000 INR out of pocket. After querying this we were told the refunded amount was correct and that this was the end of the matter. It took 7 phone calls spanning 3-4 hours, over a period of 5 weeks to receive the refund for the 2nd passenger. Each of these phone calls was to a different agent and involved explaining the situation from the beginning each time and battling the front line denials and scripted replies in order to actually discuss the issue. We were assured on each of these phone calls that the refund had already been processed (it hadn’t) or that it would be processed (it wasn’t). Only after threatening a credit card chargeback and refusing to end a call to a manager before the refund was manually actioned was the owed money refunded to us, more than a month later. From the UK we spent over £50 on phone calls to India to get our own money refunded. In total due to a combination of administrative failures on SpiceJet’s behalf, we are out of pocket approximately 22,000 INR (£250 GBP). After escalating a formal complaint to the top of their complaint channels we received no apology or acknowledgement of failure and were offered a 2,000 INR SpiceJet travel voucher which we refused. All in all, this has single-handedly been the worst customer service experience I have ever encountered with any company, anywhere in the world. SpiceJet may get you from A to B, but if you have to engage with their customer service departments via phone or email for any issues, prepare for a time consuming, fruitless and ultimately incredibly stressful experience. For your own sanity, I highly recommend you avoid this company at all costs.

### "bullying attitude of the staff"
Mangalore to Dubai. The flight scheduled to depart at 00:15 was delayed to 05:15. No corrective action was taken the Spicejet team. The delay announcement was informed at 12:45 way past the scheduled departure. More pathetic was the way the passengers were treated to. Nobody was available to answer queries, a lone lady staff was at the gate. After lot of shouting few staff came and tried to give wrong reasons. No accommodation was provided, all the 200+ passengers were cramped in the small waiting area. No compensation was provided. The flight was further delayed as they say due to technical glitch. The flight finally departed at 6:00 am. The handling of the whole situation was terrible. It was the bullying attitude of the staff that let down the airline.

### "Spicejet should exist?"
We were supposed to fly from Goa to Delhi in order to get our connection flight to Belgrad (Serbia). Our time in Delhi should have been 3 hours which was considered more than enough to catch our next flight. After the boarding was over and all the passengers were already on the plane, Spicejet allowed a group of people standing on the plane stares to literally stop the plane from departing. No one announced us what was going on, even though we asked several questions and insisted that most of the passengers have other flight connections to catch in Delhi. At some point, a stewardess told us that the people from the stairs insisted that the plane has to wait for another two people to join the flight. No clarification was brought to us. It is still unclear if Spicejet sold more tickets than the available ones in the plain, or the group of Indian people making the scandal considered is their right to stop the plane until two more friends will join, but it doesn't matter. What matters is that the crew did nothing, but waited for 1,5 hours after the boarding was finished. The passengers asked them to call the police or the airport security but nothing happened for 1,5 hours. It was a huge chaos. At some point, many passengers, tourist mainly step out of the plane, arguing with the group of people who wanted to stop the plane for departing. No reaction again from the Spicejet crew. Due to this delay, many passengers from the plane lost our connection flights and had to pay a substantial amount of money to change our flight tickets. Please be your own judge if it is acceptable that in 2017 companies like Spicejet should exist on the market?

### "irresponsible flight service"
I booked for Chennai to Hyderabad return journey on 15-Jan and 17-Jan. while traveling from Chennai flight delayed 1hr 30 min. Due to bad weather. But other flights having no issues. When traveling from Hyderabad to Chennai again 1hr delayed due consequential effect of bad weather but there is no bad weather in that time. Please do not select Spicejet such a irresponsible flight service I have seen.

### "regret booking tickets"
Gauhati to Dibrugarh. A total of 4 hours 35 minutes delay due to "operational reasons" they say; as if we have all the time in the world to wait and listen to their nonsensical excuses. I totally regret booking tickets of this airline and hope that I never have to book it again. I am surprised that there is not a single ground staff to help or assist the passengers (guess they are simply hiding and dodging us).

### "planes are clean as a classroom"
I have been flying SpiceJet for the last 4 years. To be honest, I am a bit of a patron when it comes to SpiceJet. I have lived through the worst phase of the airline in 2014 when cancellations were more common than on-time flights. However, what has struck me over the last 2 years is the transformation that the airline has seen. While most of us would assume that one man cannot weave magic, Mr. Ajay Singh seems to have done precisely that. The flights take off on time, the planes are clean as a classroom, the food is served hot and the crew are courteous. The long queues at the airport seem to magically disappear without any halla-bulla! Yet it is affordable for middle-class blokes like me. Wonder what the SpiceJet formula is! This is almost surreal!

### "never fly with Spicejet again"
I flew from Cochi to Delhi with my wife. I felt like I walked into a shop not a plane. The crew did not even offer water instead focused on selling stuff. One of the crew was so rude. I am never going to fly with Spicejet again.

### "expected the staff to be more courteous"
Flew SpiceJet from Coimbatore to Bangalore. I expected the staff to be more courteous, it was as if they were happy that people didn't want food and didn't look in the eyes of the passenger. Taxiing was smooth and we reached the destination earlier than expected. Flight took off earlier than scheduled time and we reached the destination within 5 mins of the original scheduled departure time.

### "we were literally trapped in our seats"
Pune to Dubai. SpiceJet, as you may know is a low budget airline, but who knew in this case that low budget means lowest quality? My family and I started our return flight back to Dubai with discomfort, for our seats were positioned directly in front of the emergency exit doors. So whilst we couldn't recline our seats, those in front of us could. Let me just say this resulted in little to no room for sitting, reading, or even for that matter sleeping. To provide a more visual description we were literally trapped in our seats, so if you get claustrophobic either pray you get a better seat or better yet I would recommend avoiding the flight itself. This dissatisfaction didn't stop there. The food which my sister and I had specifically pre ordered due to our dietary constraints (paleo) and already paid for was not available. As we couldn't eat any of the other meals available, we had to order 2-3 other meals and scrape at whatever we would be able to eat, which wasn't a lot as the portion sizes were extremely small, in comparison to the food available at the airport which we didn't consume due to the fact that our pre-ordered meals would be served on the plane. This review is specifically targeting SpiceJet's management and organization, not its cabin crew who were in fact very helpful with providing additional meal alternatives for us. It's a shame to think that these issues could have easily been avoided if my family and I had been informed of our seating locations prior to boarding. Sadly SpiceJet's management found it too difficult to pick up a phone to inform us about our seat arrangements and the unavailability of our meal options.

### "say thanks to the crew"
Madurai to Dubai. I want to say thanks to the crew who look after well during my journey. The treated all passengers with hospitality. They really shown lots of effort to create a memorable experience to each and every passengers including the kids and infants.

### "in flight service is terrible"
Dhaka to New Delhi via Kolkata. The in flight service is terrible! The seat was are broken, bad quality and no leg space at all, there are other aircraft small but better in terms of leg space, but this is really terrible. Something has to be done also about the services.

### "good service from cabin crew"
Chennai to Mumbai. Full marks for a good service from cabin crew. Liked to see they smiled and responded to my requests with a positive attitude. Food options were nice.

### "frequent issues with flights"
Trivandrum to Chennai. Flight was supposed to take off at 9.20 and then I get a message from SpiceJet that the flight is delayed by an hour and will take off at 10.05. But I can see on the display screen at airport the time is showing as 10.45. I’m on a time bound travel and every minute counts. This pathetic flight is being delayed for some operational error. I suggest these people stop their service since this is a frequent issues with their flights. Please do not opt this flight for your travels. I would suggest Indigo since they have been punctual for all my past travels.

### "nice flight experience"
Dubai to Pune. As I entered the flight the cabin locker is full of bags so I asked cabin staff to help me but she insisted me keep it under my seat which is practically impossible to keep it under legs all the time. I was very nervous and had to search for place for my luggage on my own. So this behaviour was pretty upsetting for me, on brighter side good food and nice flight experience. Humble and helping people are more important than any other show off.

### "said they can't help us"
Kochi to Male. I was traveling with my wife and daughter and my connecting flight happened to be late due to weather issues and the delay was informed to Spicejet staff. We were only able to reach checking counter 30 minuted before departure and they said they can't help us and they have marked us as no show. So I had to buy the ticket again for next day paying full amount (Unfortunately with Spice Jet again) and the flight was with a lot of seats unoccupied. A decent airline would've offered seat for next day flight without charging but SpiceJet doesn't care for building customer relation. If you are Flying with Spice jet I suggest to have your journey Insured to cover all the losses that you will suffer once in 5 trips with them.

### "the worst airline ever"
Cochin to Chennai. This is the worst airline ever. I had booked the flight for 10.25 am to Chennai from cochin to attend a meeting which was at 1 pm. The airline suddenly decided that they have “operational issues” and delayed the flight inside 2 hours so that they don’t have to give any alternate option. The actually reason that SpiceJet delayed the flight is because the flight didn’t have enough passengers to fly for that particular flight. When I called the customer care number the only thing they kept say was “I apologise and that we cannot do anything”. Hopefully my review helps some people to avoid this airline and select any other airline.

### "airline lacks trustworthiness"
Delhi to Bangkok. The airline lacks trustworthiness, passenger rights and transparency. Staff at check in and gate intentionally lied at us related to a delay (operational reasons) and a failed connecting flight at BKK. Thanks to the outstanding support of Bangkok Airways further damage was avoided! Spicejet left us completely alone and denied any assistance! Please do not use this airline if you at least demand 10% of passenger rights in the EU!

### "this flight delayed by 2 hrs"
Kolkata to Madurai via Chennai. I reached Kolkata a little late and 1 hr before departure they closed the counter. I could not web check-in due to some reason. So I booked another ticket from Indigo so that I could catch my connect flight (Chennai to Madurai) again from Spicejet. The flight is supposed to start at 6pm. Spicejet did it again and this flight delayed by 2 hrs. Good job Spicejet, my diwali ruined.

### "Unable to provide food"
Delhi to Jammu via Dehradun. Unable to provide food advertised as in flight menu. And unable to provide change on purchases when presented with a 500 or 2000 rupee notes. Aircraft is noisy. One of air hostes grumpy other happy. Wouldn't travel this airline again as they are unable to provide even the most basic service.

### "can do a lot better"
Dhaka to Chennai via Kolkata. An ordinary budget airline which can do a lot better. My flights were on time and in fact we arrived 5-10 minutes before the actual arrival time. Spicejet takes great pride in having this record of completing flights before time. However, the cabin left much to be desired for. On our flight from Dhaka to Kolkata there was water leaking through the light overhead. The cabin crew were generous enough to wipe them when requested and provided tissue papers. There is no food unless you pay for it. We did not try their menu. The cabin crew were fairly polite. If you are strictly in need of getting from point A to B at the cheapest cost then give Spicejet a go. Do not expect any bells and whistles though.

### "staff dealing with me was very rude "
Ahmedabad to Delhi. They announced to see the menu and let us know your choice, we’ll bring that you. I decided to go for Veg Biryani and my wife wanted Paneer Tikka Masala. When she came to take the order, we mentioned above choices but she replied that they only have Veg Cappa Noodles and Bhel. My point here is that when they have only 2 options then why can’t they make it clear in the announcement rather than giving opportunity to customer of choosing the food they like from menu and waste time. We decided to go for only left options Bhel & Cappa Noodle, so when she came to serve us the same then she asked for 350 Rs./-, I offered US Dollars because I found that in menu that they had 2 prices mentioned against each item, one in rupees and another in USD and I did have US Dollars with me (Because my current residential status is US, so my preferred way to spend money was US Dollars). She replied “let me check whether we have change for this or not” I said Ok. She came back after long and mentioned we don’t accept US Dollars in Indian flights, US dollars mentioned in menu is for our (Spicejet) international section only. The point here is when this is the rule then why she did not make it clear when I offered US Dollars in the beginning, why did she tell me that “let me check whether we have change or not”. I offered Credit Card, she said Machine is not working. Then finally I offered my last preferred mode of payment “Cash in INR” and then she accepted that and returned me the change. The staff who was dealing with me was very rude not only to me but I found her same behavior to others as well. The point here is that I would not be complaining here if things were dealt with smile and hospitality. Mistakes can be ignored if there is a humbleness and soft skills. But mistakes with rudeness and bad attitude is always a bad combination and worst specially when you work in a service industry.

### "won't recommend Spicejet"
Bangalore to Chandigarh via Hyderabad. I reached the Bangalore airport at around 12:30 so as to avoid any hassles. Then all of a sudden I see that our flight from Bangalore to Hyderabad has got delayed to around 18:10 and my other connecting flight from Hyderabad to Chandigarh was at 17:50 from Hyderabad. So there was no way I could get this flight. So, I asked Spicejet to provide any alternate flight to Chandigarh. As there were some other flights working for this area. But they said they can't do that and told me that they can provide a flight from Bangalore to Delhi which will depart from Bangalore at 21:10 and will reach New Delhi at 00:05 and then next flight from New Delhi to Chandigarh at 07:10 and will reach Chandigarh at 08:05. They said I have no other options. When I asked for hotel/Lounge service as there is a total delay of nearly 12 hours to reach Chandigarh. They simply denied and said no such facilities are provided. They just provided 1 basic lunch. I had to spend more than 6 Hours in the Bangalore Airport with no Airport lounge/hotel facility and nearly 7 Hours in the New Delhi Airport with no Airport lounge/hotel facility. If this delay would be 30 minutes or 1 hour then I would have let it go. But this is not acceptable. I won't recommend Spicejet to anyone.

### "welcomed by insensitive staff"
Mumbai to Kolkata. I see SpiceJet has already received a rating of 5/10. Nothing surprising that I was welcomed by insensitive staff at the check in counter. The on duty staff manager at Mumbai airport is one insensitive person I have met in the airport so far. I am 33 weeks pregnant travelling with my husband. I requested her to accommodate my hand baggage in check in as it would be uncomfortable for me and my husband to travel with the cabin baggage, but this lady just won't. . No hospitality or humanity. I wish I could rate it less than 1 for ground staff.

### "they said flight is delayed"
Calicut to Bangalore. Flight departure time is 8.40. I reached airport at 6.30 - after 15 min their staff came and counters opened, they said flight is delayed and will leave at 9.35. If it was delayed why did I not get an SMS on time - they message us at 7.35 knowing the delay an hour before. My experience with SpiceJet has always been bad, they don't bother - had they sent an SMS on time and not had to not sit at the airport like a fool for 3 hours.

### "worst airline experienced"
Bangkok to Delhi. The worst airline I have experienced even though this is a low cost airline. Any other budget airlines could be better than this one, I am sure. My flight from Bangkok to Delhi was 30 minutes delayed which was acceptable. However, the return trip from Delhi was absolutely terrible. They announced 6 hours prior to departure time that the flight was 1.5hrs delayed. When I reached the gate, there was another 30 mins delay. I also bought SpiceMAX package including seat leg room, priority check-in, boarding and bagguages and meals. This deal seemed okay until we wait for the baggages at the arriving airport. No priority baggage existed! All normal and prioritized baggages are mixed up. We have to wait for 30 mins till we got our "priority" bags. Additionally, the seats are cramped and the gap between rows are extremely narrow. We didn't buy SpiceMAX for the outgoing flight.

### "How cheap can it get"
We booked Spicejet from Delhi to Goa. The flight was ready to take off but there wasn't any aircon available. The pilot makes an announcement that the air conditioning will be on when the flight will take off. On the runway due to congestion we had to wait for more than 30 minutes. On the return from Goa to Delhi we had paid for our meals and had priority booking too. Our seats were 1/2D . When the hostess approached us, my daughter asked for coke, she said that we won't be able to serve as all beverages are over, only hot tea is there. I said we paid and the thing is you justed started to serve then how come nothing is there, to which she replied that we don't get refill in Goa, we get stock only once when we take off from Delhi. How cheap can it get and how can airlines behave like this.

### "seats​ are uncomfortable"
Delhi to Goa. This was my first flight and I choose SpiceJet as I thought it's a famous airline available. But trust me they has the worst staffing and customer​ service and I got a pathetic flight experience. Food is bad and seats​ are uncomfortable.

### "cabin service not up to expectations"
Tuticorin to Chennai. SpiceJet is an average low cost airline. The ground staff in Tuticorin airport were courteous and provided great service. The cabin crew were not up to expectations. Food was not free and we had to pay for it. Their service was not even close to what Jet Airways provided me on a similar route.

### "don't buy Spicemax ticket"
Chennai to Kolkata. I was keen on trying their Spicemax product which I did and wasn't happy about it. The Spicemax product offers seats with more legspace at the two front rows, priority check-in baggage arrival and complementary beverage and snacks. I feel the only reason you can buy the product is if you want priority arrival of your checked in baggage. Keeping in mind the price you pay for the product, the legspace, food and beverage quality was quite ordinary. You would rather want to be in the economy seat and buy meals and drinks on board or from elsewhere. It's much cheaper that way. The legspace, contrary to their claims, didn't seem all that wide. I am a short man but felt a taller passenger would struggle there. The airhostesses were polite and answered my enquiry about beverage choice available. Didn't interact with them much but from whatever I felt, it was fine. The captain or first officer kept quiet throughout and didn't provide any update on weather, arrival or location. The flight left on time and arrived before the time mentioned in the ticket which was good. To summarise, don't buy Spicemax ticket, especially if you don't have any baggage for check-in.

### "very professional and friendly cabin crew"
Understanding that Spicejet is a Low Cost Airline, did not expect much from them as it was just a cheap and convenient option for me. I took flight SG454 from Goa to Mumbai. As I had only hand luggage, did an online check in. However, there was no point as I had to still wait in line. The thought of 212 pax in an all economy configuration made me think that I would feel compressed in a tin can. However, the comfortable seats, very professional and friendly cabin crew and the background music (Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie) reminded me of how a flight must actually be. It's all about the experience to me and Spicejet truly delivered that experience, that too, on a very short domestic sector. I am very impressed. Very different from my previous experience with Spicejet on an International flight.

### "value for money was absolutely 5 star"
My journey from Chennai to Bangalore with SpiceJet had highs and lows. I was able to get this ticket cheaply, about 20$, which is very cheap. At the airport, the check-in line wasn't bad. At security check there was line cutting from other people which was very frustrating, but it isn't airline's fault. To start with, value for money was absolutely 5 stars. The check-in staff looked like he worked 24/7 for 50 years; he was not kind, and I felt he wasn't willing to help. For ground service itself, I went to the plane by bus since jetways can't be connected to Q400, so beware. For seat comfort, it was very narrow. Seat pitch was average for LCC but felt shorter than IndiGo's A320. I was able to rest and the seat was comfortable to sleep. For cabin service, it was not bad but not great. Cabin crew were well trained and took care of passenger safety and told passengers to remain seated after the landing. Other than that, everything was average. For food and beverages, they provided water for free and the average cost of items is about 300 rupees. Overall, I do recommend this airline despite its little bit "rude" ground staffs. The flight ticket is extremely cheap, so you can expect to save your budget for a delicious meal at the airport. Flight crews are little over average, and seats were comfortable considering that it's a LCC.

### "staff very arrogant and rude"
Madurai to Bagdogra via Chennai with SpiceJet. In their run for on-time performance this airline now takes passengers for a ride. The staff at the gates are very arrogant and rude. I traveled from Madurai to Chennai on SpiceJet. I landed on-time and had a connection to Bagdogra. My flight was at 10.25 hrs and was denied boarding when I reached the gate at 10.00. The irony is the fact I was called from the gate at 10.00 to ask if I am on my way when I was on the escalator leading to the the ground floor gate 14. Within a minute I was at the gate and they say the flight has been cleared and will be pushing back. My question why I was called if the flight was cleared was not answered and also I wanted them to put the time and reason for boarding denial on my boarding pass. This was not done and they swiftly took me to security check and asked me to leave. There again the problem starts. The staff at the main exit gate will not allow you to leave unless staff update the records. I had to run behind the staff for half an hour to get it done and get out. I take at least 15-20 flights a month and this is the only airline I have found so rude.

### "very rude staff"
Dubai to Kochi with SpiceJet. I understand that delayed flights happen, however I did not receive any information from the airline and when I arrived in the airport the flight was already delayed by 6 hours. Very rude staff. I did not expect this kind of attitude. I'm at the boarding gate - it's already 9:40am and we have supposed to have left but still no information for the new departure time. Passengers just waiting without any assistance and further information. Not recommended

### "poor level of service"
Delhi to Udaipur with SpiceJet. Second short notice cancellation of flights booked months in advance. No offer of assistance. Airline is a joke. They cancel within two weeks of the flight, but then advise that my refund will take at least 30 days. Keep away from this operator. I am a former pilot and have never experienced this poor level of service and back up options before.

### "short and pleasant flight"
Kochi to Chennai. Was a short and pleasant flight. Prebooked meal and priority baggage delivery and it worked well. but the time wasn't on positive side, flight was repeatedly delayed in Kochi for more than 4 hrs and its lost its purpose. Leaving the punctuality aside, all other worked really well. I hope its one of those incident for flight delay and rest all is well.

### "no announcement has been made"
Due to fly Spicejet from Vijayawada to Chennai. Flight delayed by 5.5 hrs. Standard Departure time is 17.20 and actual departure time given is now 22.50. Even though the flight is late, no announcement has been made on the PA system with no one notifying passengers in Vijayawada. I arrived to the airport at 15.40 and the flight is at 22.50, no food or refreshments have been provided.

### "seating arrangements are uncomfortable"
My experience with SpiceJet was very poor flying from Mumbai to Goa. The flight was delayed by 90 minutes, after boarding I asked for water but the air hostess was very rude, I asked thrice before takeoff but there was no response. The service was poor, seating arrangements are uncomfortable with not have enough legroom. The food is very expensive and of poor quality.

### "hugely impressed with the service"
BLR-DEL on B737-800. As it was Diwali day, huge rush at the check in counter, but the agents manning the counters were efficient and did a seamless check in. I was flying with Spicejet after close to 9 years, so was looking forward to the experience. Boarding was swift and without major issues. Seats cushioning was good (better than Indigo) but space was a constraint. As my ticket was a Corporate one, meal was included. I was served a full breakfast (consisting of Idli, Vada, Uttapam, Sambhar, croissant and butter). This itself was pretty heavy and I was impressed with the meal (Indigo fares so low on the meal part). After that crew asked me if I wanted a beverage. Opted for tea. They gave me a big cup of tea along with a large cookie. There was no end to the breakfast. Was hugely impressed with the service and the professionalism of the crew. To top it off, an on time arrival in DEL. Would definitely recommend Spicejet.

### "terrible on time performance"
Delhi to Dharamsala, Amritsar to Delhi and Delhi to Goa. I had 3 flights booked with this airline in the same month - the first was delayed by over 3 hours, the second was rescheduled to an earlier time without any communication and the third was fraught with airport handling issues. Good communication and empathy softens even the toughest customers and yet this airline does not understand this very basic of customer service. Not only did the airline not understand the impact of the delays/reschedule, they dismissed the claim of paying the fare difference for the second flight which we had to book urgently on another airline which ended up costing us more than the value of the entire trip (4 flight legs). I warn potential customers - do not be tempted by the lower cost that this airline purports to offer - the delays and reschedule will end up costing you an arm and a leg. There are other low cost airlines in India and I strongly advise you to travel with them over Spicejet. I am not sure how many people find the time to write a review but I did hear chatter at the gate (for the first flight that was delayed by over 3 hours) from other passengers who said they have also never seen an airline with this terrible on time performance. I have rated the airline 1 on some aspects below only because there is no option of a negative rating.

### "thank the cabin crew"
Belagavi to Bengaluru. My main aim to write this review, is to thank the cabin crew with Spicejet for making my flight a memorable one by just being a warm and friendly host on board. A simple personalised greeting to a people of a particular region, or just a generous compliment all these go a long way in making someone's day. Keep it up!

### "pathetic experience as always"
Bangalore to Pune with SpiceJet. Pathetic experience as always - flight delayed by 20 minutes and then 35 minutes with a total of 55 minutes delay. I would suggest paying a bit more but go for another airline. This is not the first time I have experienced this issue with SpiceJet.

### "great hospitality and care"
Dubai to Kochi. I sprained my right leg one hour before reporting at Dubai airport. The ground staff of Spice Jet arranged wheel chair for me. After that when I boarded the flight the crew were very caring and responsible. I am staying in Dubai for last 15 years and a regular flyer in different airlines many times in a year. I never had such a warm welcome and care in any other flight. Thank you for the great hospitality and care shown by your airline staff.

### "really a pathetic service"
Hyderabad to Delhi with SpiceJet. I don't recommend this airline. For my flight, I got a message about 24 hrs before that my flight is delayed by around 90 mins citing operational reasons. Upon enquiring, they couldn't provide any further details and customer service representative hung the phone in middle of conversation, which was very rude. This delay caused my planning to be derailed. Really a pathetic service.

### "the worst ever experience"
I flew on 1st July from Dubai to Belgaum via Mumbai. Unfortunately my both bags did not arrive in Mumbai. The same was with more than 50+ passengers. We were given the Baggage irregularity report to be filled and told bags will be sent to our house address by next day. Nothing came till 4 days. After lot of follow up with Mumbai I received my 1 bag. Other bag was still missing. I made loads of call to Mumbai contact nos given to me but most of the times they did not answer and if they answer they give wrong information that all bags have come we are searching your bag. Even the customer service did not give clear reply. I came back to Dubai on 24th and on 27th found out that my bag was lying in Dubai only. This is the co-ordination level of Spicejet. Even after 27th the customer service team writes to me that they are working on the same and will get back asap (what a great level of co-ordination). Now they want me to settle down by giving a 1000 Rs voucher, for which I should fly spice jet again. This was the worst ever experience.

### "good flight for the fare paid"
Flew with SpiceJet from Mangalore to Mumbai on 22 July 2016. Bagged tickets on sale which was very cheap. The check in took some time but I was given a window seat (on request) so I won't complain much about that. Boarding was systematic even though the flight had 95% occupancy. The flight was dot on time. Cabin was a bit smelly. Leg room was pretty good for a one and a half hour flight. Cabin crew were okay, nothing much about them. Landed before schedule at terminal 1B which I always like about SpiceJet. Overall a good flight for the fare paid.

### "delayed by 45 minutes"
The flight was delayed by 45 minutes in Jaipur for no apparent reason. It finally took off at 11.45 am. Journey was supposed to be only 40 mins. Upon reaching Delhi at 12.25 it kept circling around the airport for an hour. The staff gave air traffic congestion as the cause while other flight we landing on time. Upon arrival in Delhi the ground staff misplaced the luggage and there was no one available to provide the info about luggage. After 40 mins of searching and arguing we finally got our luggage. Instead of arriving in Delhi at 12 pm, we arrived there at 2 pm which made me miss my subsequent flight at 1.55 pm. Very poor on part of Spicejet.

### "technical problem with aircraft"
Received email from Spicejet stating SG16, Dubai - Ahmedabad rescheduled due to operational reasons and was offered option to fly via BOM. On the night of departure, SG14, Dubai - Mumbai rescheduled by 1.15 hr due to late arrival of incoming aircraft. Boarding commences at 0445 but suspended midway, stating technical problem with aircraft. 2 hours pass by, aircraft towed away from gate, all displays and personnel disappear from vicinity. Rumours aloof stating SG has not cleared its airport dues, aircraft problems, etc.. Finally, aircraft takes off at 0830hrs and lands BOM 5 hrs late only to discover SG BOM-AMD flight cancelled. Bought new ticket with different carrier and continued journey to AMD.

### "no proper response from the staff"
The flight from Bangalore to Mumbai was late by 4 hours initially which got extended with 1 more hour. No messages were sent regarding the delay. Reason given was technical issues which I do understand but the problem was there was no proper response from the staff when we enquired. 5 hour long wait at the airport, was provided with food and small bottles per boarding pass along with food which was given at 7.30. No provision of extra water, we had to buy that. When asked about the flight at 11 pm which was the timing after first delay the crew said "we have no idea" and were reluctant to call the manager. A really poor experience, not because the flight was delayed but because the passengers were not given proper attention. Will think twice before travelling with SpiceJet again. Disappointed.

### "careless approach to travellers"
Please think twice before you choose to fly with SpiceJet. This is my first fly with them flying from Dubai to Cochin but i was disappointed with the service. Flight was delayed by almost 2 hours 30 mins but the most irritating part was that staff did not provide passengers with any information and tried to argue with you when you enquired. I have never noticed such a careless approach to travellers.

### "a wonderful experience"
Dehradun to Delhi with Spicejet. Had a wonderful experience. It was my first flight and of course I was very nervous. The cabin crew was very polite and cooperative. My nervousness was on my face so their polite words calmed me down. The meal was really good. Will travel again and recommend others for sure.

### "horrible experience"
Horrible experience with SpiceJet from Chandigarh to New Delhi. Flight was delayed by around 1:30 hrs and we missed our connecting Indigo flight and had to book fresh tickets. On top of being delayed, our bag was missing at New Delhi for around 30-45 mins. We had used "Baggage First" option and paid Rs 100 each for the bags to come out first on the belt. Bags were marked as "Priority" but when we arrived 1 bag came late with no priority. Our second bag didn't arrive. When we went to SpiceJet counter they had to ask the staff to bring the bag from plane. We finally got our bag after 30-45 mins of waiting.

### "advised to avoid this airline"
The Goa to Delhi flight with SpiceJet was delayed by 3 hours "for operational reasons". When we reached Delhi an onboard announcement was made that our checked-in baggage was to be collected from belt 2. After about half the baggage had been put on belt 2, further bags stopped coming and even the sign on the belt changed to Indigo airlines. After about 10 minutes some passengers discovered their bags on belt 3 which was assigned to Indigo. Another 30 minutes passed. No baggage. Some 30 passengers waiting. The Spicejet desk informed one of us that all baggage had been offloaded and had been delivered. Shortly, a ground assistant of the airline came to the belt and upon being asked what had happened to the bags told us, "Such things happen". Meanwhile, baggage of a subsequent Spicejet flight starts coming on belts 2 and 3 which are both having signage of Indigo Another 15 minutes go by. She is still circulating among the irate passengers, "In a little while I shall find out what the problem is. or "I will have to go to the aircraft to find out what the problem is. or "Why are you complaining to me? Eventually, after a wait of 65 minutes, the rest of the bags start trickling in, one at a time with long gaps in between. After my bag came, I asked her, "Where are our bags? Her reply, "Give me some time to find out" A totally clueless dead-loss customer relations executive. I had flown Spicejet after a gap of many years. On earlier flights I had found them customer-unfriendly and had boycott them for years. Readers would be well advised to avoid this airline.

### "the crew was good"
Varanasi to Mumbai with Spicejet. Flight departed at 0730pm and arrived at 1005pm, delayed almost 35mins but this was due to congestion over BOM airspace. Aircraft was leased from a foreign company Czech registered with foreign pilots and one foreign crew member. It was the same aircraft that I flew out on, so seats were the same cramped - so much so that I had to sit diagonally to fit into the seat which is very uncomfortable on a 2 hour flight. The crew was good and offered complimentary water in cups, and smiles on faces around the cabin.

### "seats were extremely cramped"
Mumbai to Varanasi on Spicejet. Flight departed at 0720 and arrived at 0920 on time with smooth takeoff and landing. Aircraft was leased from a Czech registered company with foreign pilots and one foreign crew member. Seats were extremely cramped. Crew was good and offered complimentary water in cups.

### "definitely prefer SpiceJet again"
Travelling on route Port Blair to Chennai. The flight departed 10 minutes before scheduled time. We had opted for SpiceMax. Wonderful experience. Extra legroom and comfortable seats. Good inflight meals, though available for purchase. The flight landed 30 minutes before time. A great experience. Will definitely prefer SpiceJet again.

### "Very disappointing"
Dubai to Pune, and have been a frequent flyer with Spicejet. Usually book the Spice max tickets only for the extra legroom. Did the same this time only to know they have reduced the extra legroom to normal. Not sure why I should be paying extra to get a normal seat. Also when I contacted the call centre agent they didn't mention of any changes. Very disappointing.

### "service was excellent"
Had a great experience with Spicejet from Kochi to Mumbai in the air but a pretty poor one on the ground with this airline. At check-in the Spicejet employee asked to see the credit card I booked the tickets with. I explained that between booking my tickets and travelling, my card had expired and I had been given a new one by my bank. Hardly a rare occurrence, I would assume. I had to explain this to him three times but he still asked the same question. He eventually called his supervisor who also asked me the same question, forcing me to explain again. She then called another supervisor who checked my passport and let us check in. This caused quite a delay and unnecessary annoyance. However, when we boarded and departed (on time) the service was excellent - friendly and welcoming cabin staff, clean and comfortable cabin with decent leg room (I'm 6'1" and it was more than ok for a few hours) and good value/tasty food. I'd definitely fly with Spicejet again.

### "manners not appreciated"
On 3rd February I took a flight from Mumbai to Kashmir from Indigo. Service at the counter was efficient and prompt. I exceeded my check-in weight limit but the counter staff acknowledged that I had no handcarry and allowed me to check in the excess weight as well, and this left a very positive impression of IndiGo. On 6th February I took a flight from Kashmir to Amritsar using SpiceJet. No complains although nothing was memorable. Most likely because my baggage was underweight and I had no Handcarry. On 9th February I had another flight with SpiceJet from Amritsar to Delhi. This time my baggage exceeded the weight limit. I had no handcarry but the staff was adament I remove items from the baggage and handcarry them. It is a simple request which can be adhered if communicated well. I was in queue for almost half an hour and shoved left and right between counters. I maintained my cool because I understand the staff was busy. Once again the counter staff told me to continue waiting as passengers from earlier flights will need to check in first. Does that mean the counter staff will rudely tell you off to remove the excess weight immediately or pay the additional fees. I am expected to wait for ages for the counter to serve me but when I am need to remove the items from my baggage, I have to let all other people to finish checking-in? Another group of passengers were complaining and they got served immediately. So should I assume that manners are not appreciated by SpiceJet? As a result the staff does not have respect for the passengers? My flight to Delhi was scheduled at 4.10pm. My boarding pass said 2.55pm. When I asked the staff about the timing, they don't know what time will the flight depart. They told me to wait and listen to the announcement. How much better can this experience with SpiceJet get?

### "didn't pay close attention"
We bought a ticket for February 2, using their difficult online process with the safari browser. We didn't pay close attention to the ticket we received, until we arrived at Colombo Airport 3 hours before the flight. We then learned that our ticket was for February 15. We also learned that they had empty seats. We explained to the manager that we had to leave Sri Lanka because our visa was just about finished. He offered no help, and wouldn't even call the main office to get us a seat on the plane. So we were forced to buy a new ticket on SriLanka Airlines at the airport, and fly out that way. As I write this, I have emailed SpiceJet three times to get our money back. And understand that our tickets are still good for another week. So far, the only response I get from their customer support, is that I need to write someone else, but they don't tell me who that is. We alerted our credit card company, and hopefully we can get our money back that way.

### "Food was forgettable"
Several SpiceJet flights last year, ending with Goa to Mumbai. Marked improvement in on-time performance. Crew is not rude but not bothered. Food was forgettable. Decent experience for the fares offered. Bothered by lack of branding on newly acquired aircraft though.

### "very average experience"
Traveled SpiceJet from Colombo to Bangalore via Chenna return in Dec/Jan on a Q400 aircraft. Overall, it was a very average experience. The ground staff were very friendly and welcome. However, the cabin crew was the opposite as they looked tired and although they tried to be friendly, they weren't welcoming. The vegetarian subs they had on board was pathetic and considering the cheap quality, the price charged for the subs was quite high. The cabin experience is standard as you really can't expect much from a regional aircraft like the Q400 but I really feel that Colombo being an international sector with high demand, SpiceJet needs to use a Boeing 737. Will only recommend Spicejet if there is an excellent deal.

### "a great experience"
Chennai to Delhi with Spicejet. A great experience. Customer service at Chennai was excellent. Managed to book in early and the whole process was calm and smooth. Flight left slightly early and arrived 10mins early in Delhi. The onboard experience was also fine. Seats spacious enough and staff conscientious. Absolutely no complaints from any side.

### "wonderful SpiceJet flight "
It was a wonderful SpiceJet flight with a low fare from Dubai to Madurai. I appreciated the acptain for this too. The cabin was neat and tidy and the cabin crew was really good, especially a stewardess who was bubbling with energy throughout the four hours. She was full of positive energy with a smile and readiness to serve. It ws great flight.

### SpiceJet customer review
I was travelling SpiceJet from Pune to Dubai last week. They had clearly stated in the information card that we can pay for the items in the menu using the Indian Currency or the destination currency. Since I didnt have much of Rupees i decided to pay in Dirhams. I offered 100 AED for an item of 15AED. They said they didnt have change so I had to skip dinner. They also didnt have most of the items shown in the menu card. There was no TV in the flight which made it boring.

### "Very bad customer service"
Although SpiceJet claims it is low cost, the fare is more as they are monopoly in this sector. My problem this time is non receipt of baggage in Dubai. After checking with the Lost baggage office, they show us a list of passengers whose baggage were offloaded. There was no airline staff to guide stranded passengers. We came to know that 25 bags were offloaded. After filing the lost baggage complaint, there was no way to reach SpiceJet office to arrange delivery in Abu Dhabi the next day. Finally reached them in their India toll free number. However they were not willing to deliver in Abu Dhabi. Finally I had to make arrangement to collect from Dubai airport. Their customer service was very poor. Very bad customer service. Only trying to increase their revenue at all cost.

### SpiceJet customer review
I took the SpiceJet flight from Chennai to Kolkata. Boarding was on time but flight was delayed a bit and started running 15 mins late. Anyway that didn't matter because it reached Kolkata on time. The seats onboard were comfortable., and the food was okay. Overall was a nice flight.

### SpiceJet customer review
Booked on this airline month a ago to fly Chennai to Hyderabad. Airline cancelled the flight without providing valid reason and did not offer any acceptable alternative. Did not accommodate on an earlier flight even though there was a scheduled flight. Offered refund at such short notice and had to buy another ticket at a premium (5 times the cost originally paid). No apologies and ordinary people like me feel trapped.

### SpiceJet customer review
My experience on SpiceJet was the worst I have ever had. It started off right from Dubai airport at check-in. My flight was meant to depart at 23:10hrs. The display said 23:10 when we entered the queue and within minutes the display for Delhi departure turned to 02:20hrs. A member of the ground staff came to the queue and announced all Delhi passengers to leave the queue as the Delhi check-in had been closed - no reason was given. So my son and I left the queue and sat down in the waiting area. After about 45 minutes we asked another member of staff and we were told the check-in had re-opened - no announcement had been made though. After check-in I contemplated returning home and coming back 2.5 hours later - when I asked how I can get accurate flight status I was told it is best to hang around at the airport. Even the SpiceJet website would not give up to date information as the delay was owing to incoming flight being diverted to Mumbai. So we decided to stay on airport. The flight was further delayed to 03:30hrs. After an uncomfortably long wait we finally boarded. Everyone was tired and the cabin lights were dimmed after take-off. I thought I should use the washroom before settling down. To my horror I found there was no soap or hand towels. When I asked the cabin crew they said "sorry madam, it is finished. This flight was diverted to Mumbai and the aircraft was not serviced in Dubai so we have run out of supplies". I returned to my seat and tried to get some sleep. The rest of the flight was uneventful but devoid of service of any kind. There was no drinks and snacks, even though it is meant to be a paid service. Not even water was offered to the passengers - only those who asked got it. At one point I woke up and went to the galley to ask for water and the air hostesses were asleep! Unacceptable standards of service. Agreed SpiceJet is a budget airline but even so there is something called professionalism which was totally lacking here. Needless to say, I am not looking forward to my return flight.

Considering the cost of our tickets we weren't expecting too much, however SpiceJet were perfectly adequate for the 2 hour flight. I found the seats comfortable although my much taller partner found them to be cramped (as we hadn't opted to pay extra for the extra leg room). Both ground crew and flight attendants were friendly. The most important part though was that the flight departed on time, arrived on time and our checked baggage made it.

### SpiceJet customer review
Very bad experience on flight SG 3309 from Chennai to Bangalore 21 May 2015. 1) Asked twice for an air sickness bag but not provided with one until the end of our journey. 2) They did not switch on the air-conditioning properly - everyone was complaining. 3) The bus for transfer from the gate to airplane was very hot and they stopped near the plane for more than 10 minutes. 4) Airplane was not cleaned properly.

Travelled on 3rd March 2015 to DEL-KOCHI and KOCHI-DEL on 8th March 2015. DEL-Kochi was a pleasant journey. As it's a low cost airline there was no inflight entertainment. We had opted for pre-booked meal options but we've got SMS that food will not be served. When enquired with the cabin crew they didn't have any concrete answers. Anyway flight landed on time. Kochi-DEL. Flight was scheduled to leave at 7pm from Kochi but delayed by 1.5-2 hrs. It was scheduled to stop at Mumbai but changed to Hyderabad. At Hyderabad no one was sure whether we continue in the same flight or change planes. After 10-20 mins we learnt that we needed to get on another plane. Again we got the message that meals are not available in the flight and even no water bottle given to us in all the flights. I am not sure why they still have the meal option on their website. In terms of ticket pricing rates are cheaper than other airlines but it doesn't matter if they are not able to provide the basic things.

SG105 DEL-IXZ (Port Blair Andaman Islands) via Kolkata. On time on the way to IXZ. Staff were pretty helpful. Free water bottles distributed during layover in CCU. They do not let you out of the aircraft during a layover. Food options available were pretty poor. They did not have most of the things printed on the menu. On the return leg the flight was on time to CCU from Port Blair. However there was a delay in CCU due to some mechanical failure. Had to wait it out at the airport. SpiceJet has an on time guarantee service. A few days later we received a complimentary RS.500 coupon to avail on spice jet flights. Overall pretty professionally handled delay.

### SpiceJet customer review
DEL-DXB. Check-in was chaotic but ground staff were efficient and helpful. Flight on a new 737 but legroom was tight but the seats were ok for a short 3 hour flight. Service was extremely inefficient it felt like the cabin crew did not go through proper training. It took them more than 2 hours to service the entire aircraft and we were lucky enough that we pre-ordered our meals beforehand. Also they served our meals first before our drinks which should have been the other way around. We nearly choked waiting for our beverage. Food however was of excellent quality. The quality and quantity were great and while it was just a basic meal the taste far exceeds that of other major airlines like Emirates. Overall a mediocre flight. While crew was a just a little bit friendly the service efficiency was just a disaster.

### SpiceJet customer review
Delhi-Dubai-Delhi on Boeing 737. Both Flights on time. Spicejet doesn't have IFE and food and beverages are buy on board. Seats have no leg room at all. Staff is ok (if not great). Overall flight is not recommended. Indigo airlines is a much better option.

### SpiceJet customer review
SG 275. The flight was excellent and the crew members were friendly. The flight landed 30 mins ahead of time and I will choose Spicejet again in the future. However the flight should have some entertainment.

### SpiceJet customer review
Recently took flight from Delhi to Aurangabad on 7th June 2014. Departure time was 10am. Check in was smooth. We were bussed to the aircraft. The bus was air conditioned and well maintained. Though the flight took off 15 mins behind schedule it landed at Aurangabad on time. The aircraft was well maintained and the staff were very helpful. Will certainly fly Spicejet again.

### SpiceJet customer review
I travelled by Spicejet flight (SG-248/247) from Mumbai to Goa and back. Both times the flight was delayed by 15-30 minutes from the scheduled departure. The biggest let down about Spicejet is the fact that they have a very extensive food menu but they don't have any food or beverages onboard (except for water). I had pre-booked and paid for a meal (Chicken Sandwich) for my onward flight which was never served to me. The reason given to me was that there was no food available onboard. Don't get fooled by the pre-booking discount (20%) they offer as they charge a convenience fee which eventually escalates the price more than buying the same meal on flight. The FA's just keep running from one end of the fuselage to the other carrying papers in their hand. I can't recommend Spicejet.

### SpiceJet customer review
Travelled from PNQ-BLR return. Both flight were airbus A320. Punctual and left on time and reached few minutes ahead of schedule. Cabin crew were friendly and cheerful. As it was just an hour long flight I did not opt for any in-flight food but I observed that the portions were rather small. Seat pitch is bit cramped but OK for short domestic flights. As expected from a budget carrier there was no in flight entertainment but the in flight magazine was nice. Total 22 kilogram baggage allowance (15 for check in and 7 for cabin) is also generous. Overall pleasant experience will definitely fly with them again.

### SpiceJet customer review
I flew from Bangalore to Bangkok last month it was a good experience with on time arrival and on time departure. Cabin staff were we co-operative and friendly. the only negative part as per me is the legroom which is not so comfortable for longer travelling.

### SpiceJet customer review
I traveled on February 9 2014 from Kolkata to Mumbai and was extremely disappointed with the experience. I have written some really good reviews in the past about Spicejet however this experience was not up to my satisfaction. The aircraft used was an old Boeing and the interiors were extremely shabby. Most of the seats were torn from all corners and were in extremely poor condition. The leg room was the worst I have experienced on a flight. They need to sort out the basics rather than focusing on being #1 in terms of on time performance. The only good thing I can think of in the entire flight was the behavior of the cabin crews.

### SpiceJet customer review
SG3302 from Belgaum (IXG) to Chennai (MAA) via Bengaluru (BLR) by VT-SUP (Q400 propeller aircraft). Departed ahead of time from Belgaum and arrived around 30 mins early into Bengaluru. The plane stopped at BLR for around an hour for refuelling and cleaning. BLR to MAA flight also departed around 20 mins early from BLR. Clouds at Chennai made the landing very turbulent. However the (only 2) cabin crew were very friendly and smiling.

### SpiceJet customer review
Mumbai to Mangalore 5th Dec 2013 12.30 pm. We never had any problems with baggage they allowed 2 check in bags for each passenger approx 30 kg/passenger. Airport personnel were pleasant even inflight service was nice. Right on time. Aircraft's are new.

### SpiceJet customer review
BLR-IXG on a small prop plane. Check-in at BLR was efficient crew friendly. Seats on the small Dash8 were reasonably comfortable and the flight was smooth. As it is a no-frills airline you have to buy snacks on board. Overall a positive experience.

### SpiceJet customer review
I have traveled multiple times between MAA-IXM and IXM-MAA segments. It's a short leg except for one trip which was delayed 2.5 hours all others were on time and arrival was always early. Spicejet need to focus on the customer service. It's a regional flight travelling to Madurai and I don't see why announcements were made in Hindi. Food is expensive. Overall happy flights except for a few bits and pieces. They could improve customer service and introduce a rewards program.

### SpiceJet customer review
My family travelled from Dubai to Madurai (SG24) with two kids (3 years and 18 months). Once I purchased ticket I paid for food also (AED 25). Onboard I faced the following problems: 1) They didn't provide a bassinet. 2) No seat belt provided for my other child who was to sit on my lap. 3) No earplugs. 4) Total flying time was 4 hours after 3 hours they provided a meal I had to ask for our pre-booked meals otherwise we wouldn't have got them. No hospitality no responsibility. A very poor service.

### SpiceJet customer review
We have booked and paid for 5 flights with SpiceJet. Of those 5 three were cancelled without any issues with weather/external circumstance (i.e. all internal SpiceJet operational issues) and one was delayed by 2 hours. Only one flight managed to make it to the destination on time. Worse SpiceJet does not pay for hotels or offer any sort of recompense when they cancel a flight due to operational issues (including not having enough passengers) all they offer is to book you on the next available SpiceJet fight (note that they refuse to buy you a ticket on any other airline) which is usually the next day and forces you to either pay for an additional hotel night out of pocket or lose a night that you had already paid for. They don't even offer to make the seat selection free after forcing you to change your plans completely. The additional 250 rupee charge is just a slap in the face after they tell you there is nothing they can do about completely disrupting your travel a day before you are supposed to leave. They are the worst Indian airline. Not only does SpiceJet not get you to your destination on time you're usually a day late.

### SpiceJet customer review
I purchased 3 SpiceJet tickets to travel on weekends over the last 2 months. Every flight was either delayed more than 2.5 hours or flat-out cancelled and I have never been offered anything (other than an "apology") for my troubles. The first flight was delayed 3 hours due to mechanical issues. The second was cancelled 1 hour prior to departure with no warning due to mechanical issues on the inbound flight. They had no flights available until the following morning. Some passengers on the flight missed international connections the value of their international flights was forfeited and they had to pay hefty change fees. I took my refund and had to hire a driver who drove me 7 hours overnight. My flight tomorrow (Thurs afternoon) was cancelled due to mechanical issues. They couldn't find another plane so I will have to fly out Friday morning as it is the only flight available. They refused to put me on an Air India flight that was at the same time as my original flight. Their customer service is pathetic. I will never fly SpiceJet again.

### SpiceJet customer review
PNQ to MAA return. The experience was pretty bad. The airline advises customers to arrive 2 hrs before scheduled departure we arrived 1 hr 45 mins prior to departure and the check-in counter was closed. There was nobody at the Spicejet counter. Had to wait 30 mins. Then told that the flight was delayed by 1 hr due to the aircraft from Delhi arriving late. When we asked for a single row seating at the front they told us that we would be charged 500 rupees per person for the front row. Had to forcefully opt for second last row seat. The flight arrived departed on time the aircraft was fairly okay the interiors and the night lighting was great but overall not a good trip - expected lot more from Spicejet.

### SpiceJet customer review
BLR-DEL and back. The onward flight was Monday early morning flight - full. It was a pleasant trip. right on time. Check in was smooth. Return flight was Tuesday afternoon. Pretty much empty (40% load I guess). Had the whole row to myself. Smooth check in. On time flight. Would definitely like to travel again with them.

### SpiceJet customer review
My husband and I flew SpiceJet and I must say it was an overall bad experience. Flight was booked for 10.30 am and at first the flight was delayed to 12.20 pm after which I received a call stating the flight had been further delayed to 1.50pm. I fail to understand why there was a 3.5 hour delay. The staff at the counters did not offer any solution apart from the manager whom we contacted at the end.

### SpiceJet customer review
I travelled 4 domestic flights with Spicejet November 2012 Delhi - Varanasi Varanasi - Delhi Delhi - Goa and Goa - Delhi. All 4 flights were delayed from 30 minutes to more than one hour. This made reaching connecting flight very difficult and I almost missed a flight back home to Europe because of that. I pre-ordered food on all this flight and got the same meal every time. Once the meal was delivered just a few minutes before the preparing for landing instructions came. So in fact I hadn't time to finish my meal. Altogether my experiences with Spicejet were negative.

### SpiceJet customer review
Boeing 737-800 from BLR to BOM. Boarding completed in record time and departure on time. Cabin crew welcoming and efficient in providing water to all passengers on a flight that wasn't quite full. Kudos to cockpit crew for a smooth take-off climb cruise descent and landing in somewhat perilous conditions (heavy rains). Plenty of legroom and well-spaced-out seats on board with ample reading in the in-flight magazine. Disappointing that the airline does not stock a few extra hot meals for those who didn't pre-order them. SpiceJet is well-placed and commendable for its extremely cost-efficient yet never lacking in any aspect of low-cost service.

### SpiceJet customer review
B737-900ER of SpiceJet which was one of their newest aircraft. My destination was Goa. Our boarding started 15 minutes prior to departure and there was a mess with the stamp on my boarding pass. So we had to go back to the security check area and get a stamp on - ground staff was polite and they had the bus waiting for us. We took off from Mumbai relatively on time and reached Goa in 45 minutes contrary time given by airline which was 1h 05m. I found the seat comfortable with enough legroom. We didn't buy food in-flight for a 45 min flight. The staff of SpiceJet was most polite I have seen.

### SpiceJet customer review
Round trip from Chennai to Hyderabad. Morning departure from Chennai. The boarding was complete 20 minutes before scheduled departure time and then we had to wait for close to 30 mins for a piece of cargo to arrive from another location. The captain was prompt enough to explain the reason for the delay hence there was no confusion. Clean aircraft with attentive cabin crew. Return flight at night was delayed 2 hours but was informed about the same in the afternoon through a text message which I think is a positive step. The flight to Chennai was operated by an all women crew which I think is a first as far as the low cost airlines in India are concerned. Overall good experience.

### SpiceJet customer review
Very bad customer service. Flight delayed 30 mins initially then 1 hour 2 hours 3 hours and it went on and on. The cancellation was not allowed by the customer service because apparently their systems were not update with the reality on the airport. Stranded at Chennai airport for 8 hours and tried to change it but was disregarded by the staff. Being economical does not mean that you start ignoring passengers who are asking you legible valid questions as and when you feel like.

### SpiceJet customer review
BOM-CCU-BOM. The flights were on-time each way. Cabin crew were warm and friendly. Have travelled Spicejet earlier as well and was impressed to see the improvements they have made over the years. The only issue I had was on my BOM-CCU flight where the leg space was inadequate. However the flight from CCU-BOM was excellent.

### SpiceJet customer review
21-01-2013 BOM-COK Boeing 737. The check-in procedure was quite disorganised with the longest possible line for any airline I could see at Bombay. Their website says you cannot do web check-in if you need to check in baggage. For an early morning flight this rule makes you leave home at least half an hour before other airlines. Staff allotted me an aisle seat in the non-reclining row before exit without informing me since I am relatively tall the leg space was quite insufficient the only reason to be thankful was the gentleman in front of me did not recline his seat. Overall have had better experiences on other Indian budget airlines like Indigo. Staff are good but could do with some more training. Would I fly this airline again - perhaps but the price will need to be good to consider this alternative.

### SpiceJet customer review
Mumbai to Goa and back. Good airline which was on time. Food to buy on board. Free checked luggage allowance.

### SpiceJet customer review
Colombo (CMB) to Chennai (MAA). Aircraft used was Bombardier Q400 with a flying time of around 1 hrs 40 mins. The aircraft was clean and new. Check-in and boarding was smooth and efficient. Very comfortable flight. Overall a good experience.

### SpiceJet customer review
Goa to Hyderabad on a Bombardier. Nice aircraft. Flight was delayed but we were informed a few days prior. Overall good experience.

### SpiceJet customer review
Less than 24 hours after I booked my ticket online I got a text message letting me know that the flight time had changed by 30 minutes. On the way to the airport I got another text message letting me know that my flight would be delayed by 30 minutes. I got to the airport and was told the delay would now be an hour. One hour later after the original departure time the plane didn't show up for another 30 minutes. The plane was small but clean and looked new. Bottled water was handed to everybody. Overall the flight was pleasant but the delays make the trip exhausting for I spent more than 4 hours at the airport. Also while it was nice they sent a text message it would have been nice if they sent an email. I'm not an Indian resident but got a local phone and realized I wouldn't have known about the flight changes if I didn't have a local phone.

### SpiceJet customer review
MAA-TRV. Chennai Airport looks like it needs replacing and the security queue snaked around the terminal building. The flight was late boarding mainly because the domestic terminal only had two gates in use. Aircraft was a modern Bombardier Q400 which was two thirds empty. The wrong aircraft safety card was in my seat pocket I showed this to one of the crew and she replaced it. Cabin Crew were attentive and efficient in their tasks. Flight arrived 30 minutes late into Trivandrum and the bags took about 15 minutes to come out.

### SpiceJet customer review
Flew Bombay to Kochi on Spicejet. Early morning departure and a full plane. My partner and I got seats in the last row - uncomfortable and cramped for the 2 hour flight but a full flight so no chance of changing seats. Poor service on board with terrible crew. Got to Kochi only to be told the return flight was cancelled on our date of return. Called their Customer service and were rebooked very efficiently on another flight- and even to a new destination as we had missed a connection. Flight back much better. Service great. Was like flying 2 different airlines.

### SpiceJet customer review
We were flying to Trivandrum from Chennai. The journey takes about one hour fifteen minutes. The flight was announced and we boarded at 6.30 pm and were supposed to take off at 7 pm. No announcement till 7.15 pm. When passengers approached the cabin crew they did not know what was happening. The flight crew was arguing with the ground staff. There was nothing to eat or drink. The pilot announced that there will be some refreshments but nothing came. Finally after an hour and half the flight took off. We reached Trivandrum around 9.30 pm. The experience was awful. If there was an issue the airlines should have delayed the flight instead of boarding passengers and make them wait on the Tarmac without any option of cancelling the journey or even getting refreshments. We never did the mistake of taking a Spicejet flight again.

### SpiceJet customer review
This is a low fare airlines that appeals to many budget minded travelers. However the airlines baggage policy is completely out of line with the international standards. For example most international carriers offers checked-in luggage up to 23 Kg while SpiceJet is only 20 Kg. The carry-in is limited to 7 Kg only. When you check in your luggage after arriving from overseas journey SpiceJet charges 200 Rupees per Kg an extraordinarily high rate. Checking-in Staff are eager to charge and seldom give a consideration to a traveler's appeal. One feels trapped as there is no option. My advice to SpiceJet increase the weight limit to 23 Kg and institute a flat fee in Indian Rupees equivalent to $25 dollars for an extra piece of checked-in luggage not the 200 Rupees per Kg rate. My advice to international travelers do not expect any concession from ground staff; most of them are trigger-happy to charge fees for extra weight.

### SpiceJet customer review
On time departure from BLR and 30 mins early into Kolkata. Relatively old aircraft but well maintained. Quality of food served was good.

### SpiceJet customer review
DEL-KTM-DEL on a relatively old B737-800. Nothing much is expected from a LCC but the worst part was the leg room and space. As we were travelling with our 6 month old child we barely moved for the entire 1.5 hrs flight due to limited space. Barring this everything else went fine. FA were courteous and helpful.

### SpiceJet customer review
BLR-DEL. Smooth check in friendly ground crew. We were flying their 737-900 aircraft. Poor seat pitch. I'm 5'11 and my knees kept knocking the seat in front. Agreed Economy airlines offer bad legroom but this was hopeless. Luckily I was the only person in my row and could get some extra room by reclining the middle seat. Food is not free as with most budget carriers rates are good.

### SpiceJet customer review
SpiceJet from Hyderabad-Delhi. My sister had booked a ticket for me using an international credit card but when she realised the ticket should be booked using Indian credit card if the ticket owner is not travelling she managed to get an Indian credit card from her friend and called customer care of SpiceJet and made the payment using the Indian credit card. When I reached check-in I was told I can't board the flight because payment had been made using a credit card of someone else. They didn't listen to me we had checked 4-5 times with the airline when making the payment that this would be okay. I was harassed by the staff and they asked me to pay the money in cash. Finally they took cash and asked me to sign a declaration and only then could I board the flight. When I reached home and called their customer care they just said sorry it's our system's fault.

### SpiceJet customer review
Pune to Delhi return. The outbound was delayed and so my 11am departure became a 3pm departure. They kept messaging us the delayed time but does not help when you have appointments you are missing. The ground staff in Pune had no empathy and we got not even a hint of an apology for the delay. Cabin crew nicer - friendly attitude and good service. Return delayed as well by one hour. Check in staff in Delhi no better. The only reason I would not recommend this airline is that every flight on both days seemed to be running late.

### SpiceJet customer review
Jaipur to Kochi via Mumbai. Clean aircraft friendly crew a bottle of water free small offering of food an drinks to a fair price. I was surprised of the product quality. The new domestic terminal in Mumbai is clean and has quiet corners to relax.

BLR-DEL-BLR because their price was very attractive. The meal price is reasonable and meal was good. Seats okay service fine. The return flight was delayed for an hour however the crew was apologetic.

### SpiceJet customer review
Delhi-Kolkata return on 737-800. The check-in at Delhi was fast and staff polite and helpful. The departure was on time and plane was spotless. Seats were allocated there were no charges for checked luggage and a bottle of water was given to each passenger. In row 11 the seat pitch was fairly tight but only a problem when the person in front reclined her seat. Check- in at Kolkata was OK but travellers should be aware that you go to have all your luggage scanned before going to the check-in desks.

### SpiceJet customer review
Cochin to Mumbai. I As it is a low-fare airline you have to buy food or drinks onboard but prices seem reasonable. The plane seemed clean. It was an uneventful flight quite different from the glamor flying with Kingfisher. But for the money we spent it was a worth the value.

### SpiceJet customer review
Delhi to Chennai. 3 hour delay due to dodgy plane. New plane had 18 fewer seats but we still try and fit everyone on. 3 adults and 2 kids per row. Don't start the air conditioner for an hour as you sit on the tarmac in 45 degree heat. Almost mutiny everyone standing up and waving their arms around. No food and the least leg room I've ever seen on a flight.

### SpiceJet customer review
Pune to Delhi return flight. Convenient timings with a 9am arrival in Delhi. Smooth check in and service on flight satisfactory. Return again convenient with a late evening flight arriving at 2300. Full flights both ways so aircraft crowded and the leg room in the seats are so limited that you feel crammed in for the flight. Fare similar to others but as its non stop it pips Indigo airlines on this route.

### SpiceJet customer review
We booked our tickets on Spicejet with a travel agent in Surat on August 2009 for travel January 2010 for Goa to Mumbai flight in the afternoon so some of us can catch a flight back to US from Mumbai that night. As we were standing in line at Goa airport for more than an hour they took down the Mumbai sign at the check in counter. On inquiry the check in person told us the flight was cancelled and the fare will be refunded to the travel agent- no other assistance or help. We had to scramble to GoAir counter to get to Mumbai before we are no show at the international flight. GoAir charged us INR 45951 for 7 tickets to Mumbai. Spicejet is irresponsible in its policies and attitude. They left 200+ international passengers in limbo at a place without accomodation or any other help. In light of our experience I would advise anyone with any plans for further travel to stay away from booking their tickets on Spicejet unless they want to jeopardize their plans and wallet!

### SpiceJet customer review
Keenly priced tickets. They take a practical view of baggage allowances which is very helpful. Overhead lockers are somewhat low and can be awkward for odd-shaped carry-on bags. FAs are very courteous. Seat pitch is unsatisfactory but for short flights this may not pose a problem.

### SpiceJet customer review
CJB - DEL (via HYD). Departure punctual arrival late due to endless approach into Delhi. Whilst you get what you pay for in terms of service on this type of airline I was surprised at the rudeness of the CC. When on the ground in HYD one of them addressed me as if I was an inmate in a prison camp for wishing to use the toilet. However in the air with turbulence warning and seat belt signs on pax were walking up and down to the toilet freely.

### SpiceJet customer review
Mumbai-Delhi check-in did not take very long. Seats were pre-assigned as the flight was full 20 mins delay departing. B737-800 cabin clean. Seat pitch very tight. Food for purchase was a good selection of snacks and beverage ie. sandwiches cookies muffins tea coffeeetc. Cabin crew disappeared after food sale and only returned to collect the trash. Overall a good experience except for the very tight seat the price was extremely competitive.

### SpiceJet customer review
BOM-DEL and IXB-KOL. Both flights were heavily delayed. Was the worst Indian airline in terms of punctuality and service. Also they seem to get the furthest possible bays which means taking almost an hour from the plane to the airport after landing. I would not fly with them again.

### SpiceJet customer review
Delhi to Srinagar via Jammu. The time of my web-booked flight had changed but I had not been notified of this and therefore arrived at the airport far too early. Luckily there was an earlier flight and the person at the ticket counter changed my booking to this flight at no extra cost. Seats were allocated at check in but there was no scramble anyway as there were only 100 passengers. The 737-800 was clean and the crew were quite friendly. Overall a positive experience - but Spicejet have already started cutting routes and frequencies so things are looking tough for the Indian locos.

### SpiceJet customer review
Pune to Chennai return. Flown for the first time with them and found them okay. Planes were new and clean. Both flights were on time. FAs well groomed and do a good job. Food served was not free and was more of a snack. For the fare they charge you its a very good airline to fly with in India.

### SpiceJet customer review
DEL-CJB (via HYD). We chose this flight for its convenient timing. SpiceJet's ticket office at Delhi Airport is very hard to find (as an exception to the rule it's located outside the temporary ticketing hall). Check-in friendly and efficient. Boarding via a bus with a ridiculously high step. Flight left on time meaning we actually lifted off the runway at the scheduled time of 1710 (a miracle given today's crowded Indian airports). Onboard catering limited and expensive. On the second leg (HYD-CJB) there were two incidents of altercations between cabin crew and pax mainly over the issue of the complimentary water bottles not being provided (ostensibly because of turbulence preventing service although the seatbelt signs were NOT on) yet the FAs were happy to serve anyone who wanted to purchase any food or beverages. These two unpleasant situations were not handled well by what came across as a particularly arrogant FA. Landed in CJB on time.

### SpiceJet customer review
PNQ-HYD. I booked with a foreign credit card which caused a bit of a delay at check-in. All boarding at Pune is done via remote stands though it was done quite efficiently and we actually pushed back 5 minutes early. The plane was a B737-800 and it was clean and well-maintained. The FAs were efficient and friendly. There's no IFE at all but since the flight time was only 1 hour it wasn't a big deal. Main complaint was the seat pitch which seemed a bit tight though it was manageable for a 1 hour flight. Being an LCC you had to pay for everything on board except for water but the prices are reasonable - 20 rupees (about 50 cents) for juice and 60 rupees (about $1.50) for a sandwich. You also have to pay to pre-reserve a seat online but again the cost is negligible at 50 rupees (about $1.25). If you are booking online also beware that you will be offered trip insurance after you select your flights and the default is set to yes so pay attention before finalizing your purchase. The flight arrived at HYD about 5 minutes early and although my bag was the last on the carousel it only took about 10 minutes to appear. Overall a good value for the price I paid at about $52 for an advance purchase one-way ticket.

### SpiceJet customer review
AMD-HYD return quite happy with the product. New B737-800. Were offered soft drinks & peanuts on a 1 hr 15 min. flight. FAs attentive and efficient. On-time performance both ways. Can't really fault the offering. I'd rate it as above average LCC experience.

### SpiceJet customer review
DEL-BOM-DEL. A good and cheap budget carrier. New spotless aircraft friendly service and flights were in time. I have no complaints at all except the horrible Delhi airport but that is not the fault of Spicejet. Everything about Spicejet reminded me of Easyjet if compared to an European low-cost airline.
