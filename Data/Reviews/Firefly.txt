### "certainly pick Firefly again"
I've flown Firefly a number of times on intra-Sabah routes (Kota Kinabalu - Sandakan and Kota Kinabalu - Tawau) and I've never had any issues with them. This flight was no different. One day before the flight, it was delayed by 10 minutes. I was informed of this delay via e-mail and SMS. The queue at the check-in counter in Kota Kinabalu was quite long, but aside from that everything else went smoothly. The flight departed and landed on time and the cabin was clean and comfortable, passengers were given salted peanuts, cookies and a bottle of water. At Tawau, the aeroplane was parked at a jet bridge. Baggage claim went faster than it usually does in Kota Kinabalu. I was very satisfied with my experience and will  for my future trips.

### “Unreliable Airline”
Unreliable Airline. I booked Firefly tickets in Nov 2024 for a scheduled flight from Subang to Alor Star. We were supposed to depart from Subang Airport on 29/1/2025 and return from Alor Star on 30/1/2025; however on 23/1/2025, the Airline sent me an update email to inform that my 29/1/2025 departure has been rescheduled to 31/1/2025 due to operations issue, but my return flight remained as 30/1/2025; and if I am not accepting the rescheduling, I can request for full refund - that was the only option I was given. I was very annoyed with the last moment cancellation of flight as it disrupted my journey, how can I accept the reschedule when my return flight was earlier than departure flight. I was wondering is this the illogical way Firefly works? No wonder they have operations issue. To my anger, few days later, the Airline published additional flights for 29/1/2025 departure from Subang, but the ticket price was 3 times higher than the one I purchased in Nov 2024. I wrote a protest email to the Airlines and was told that they only received approval to have additional flights on 24/1/2025 - a day after they cancelled my departure flight; and since I have asked for full refund, there was nothing they can do. Do you think Firefly has treated its customer fairly?

### "Terrible airline"
Not Verified | Terrible airline which has done multiple reschedules on the same day itself. I have encountered this situation multiple times and no action taken. This year been worst as their flights have never been on time and keep pushing out the time every 1-2 hours till max 6 hours we are hanging in the airport with nothing. This is truly big impact if you are on business or even vacay which it will definitely spoil your mood on it. This is truly the last time I will take this flight, we have had enough of delays.

### "promised to consider a refund"
Not Verified | Similar to other customers, Firefly retimed flight (tried to make us go at 7am to airport instead of evening, which I've never experienced!!) and since we couldn't make this time we had to spend an additional hotel night and unplanned extra day. The following day, flight was also delayed departure 2+ hours. No hotel or other compensation offered in either circumstance. After weeks of no reply from email complaint process, finally complained to MAVCOM (Malaysian airline regulator). Smooth and efficient process, which I would encourage others to do the same! Weeks later, Firefly got back in touch and promised to consider a refund .... still waiting 2+ months after the incident, Have now resorted to posting the MAVCOM case number on Social Media to ask their staff to reply. As a point of reference, it is now cheaper for 2 passengers to drive from SG to KL (less than $S 400). Takes 3.5-4 hours door to door without airport hassle in an Alphard. There used to be a time savings with Firefly but with how often their flights have operational issues seems this is no longer the case.

### "to be avoided at all costs"
Not Verified |  Firefly is a company to be avoided at all costs. Our flight from Penang to Kota Kinabalu was retimed 4 times right up to the last minute, totally disrupting our trip and our appointments. This company has no consideration for its customers. Travelers are treated like cattle. Definitely prefer the national airline. Firefly has no consideration for its customers, and depends on very poor management and haphazard organization, which leaves passengers vulnerable. Firefly est une compagnie à éviter absolument. Absolument pas fiable. Nous avons eu notre vol entre Penang et Kota Kinabalu retimed 4 fois jusqu’au dernier moment avec pour conséquence une totale perturbation de notre voyage et de nos rendez-vous. Cette compagnie n’a aucune considération pour ses clients. Les voyageurs sont traités comme du bétail. Préfère sans aucun doute la compagnie nationale. Firefly n’a aucune considération et elle est tributaire d’un très mauvais management et une organisation aléatoire qui met les passagers en situation de vulnérabilité

### "A company to avoid"
Not Verified |  A very bad company that cancels flights at the last minute when they are not full enough according to their criteria, and puts you in terrible difficulties, especially if you have a connection. The frequencies are low and don't allow you to reschedule favorably. A company to avoid

### “just avoid this airline”
My return flight from Penang was retimed. Since I purchased free flight change for both ways of my flight, I attempted to change the flight to an earlier one. This option was disabled on the "Manage My Booking" link on my login page on the app. I then went on live chat to resolve this issue since this airline has no customer line. I initiated the chat at 7.41pm and received a response 1.5hours later at 9.18pm. I was informed that I could change my flight, provided the new return flight request, and was then informed during the same live chat - that I was not eligible to change my flight. Basically, the airline cancelled my free flight change purchase without notification, after they retimed the flight. With this situation and with my flight due the next morning, I had no choice but to purchase a new flight ticket which cost me an additional RM468.31 (one-way) - this price also included a Change Fee of RM150.00. It took them 2 weeks and many emails further to respond to my initial complaints - they offered to resolve this with a RM81 refund payment in lieu of the cost of the one-way free flight change that was indiscriminately canceled with no advance notice. There is no mention and no further resolution towards the additional costs that were unnecessarily incurred due to their wrongdoing. I've flown this airline for years and this kind of retiming and conduct started just recently. All I can say is just avoid this airline since there is simply no clear operating procedures in their service.

### "the last time I fly with them"
Flight arrived on time. My luggage arrived, too, but I had to "rescue" from the back of the delivery belts (it had falled on the area after it). The plane smelt very bad. I don't know if they even had any kind of issue with ventilation or similar questions, as the smell was really very bad. I purchased (I had paid for it) an aisle seat on the front (it was a flight landing late, so disembarking earlier was really important for me), and they moved me to a middle seat. Emergency seat, it's true, but still middle seat where you have to fight for both arm rests with others. They forced me to put at the top the small fanny pack I bring attached with valuables (passport, money, credit cards, mobile phone... ). Anxiety while this happened was obvious. Even leaving it at the front, where the safety instructions are stored (it fitted without problems) was not acceptable for them. I have flown hundreds of flights with many companies, and it's been the first time it was a problem. Obviously I had to accept it for not losing the flight, but I have it clear it's the last time I fly with them.

### "company has stopped the call center"
The company has stopped the call center since 1 July, however livechat no response, and when responded live chat ended by service in the midst of processing the request.

### “Horrible customer service”
Firefly is truly the worst airline I have ever encountered. Horrible customer service, delays all the time, delays multiple times for the same flight. As paying customers, we have plans too, and we need reliable airline services. Frequent delays like these are totally unacceptable, and disrespectful to customers. USELESS. Would give zero stars if I could.

### "Service was fast and efficient"
Not Verified |   Service was fast and efficient. I lost my purse in the flight and found it easy to report via the customer service line. The case was immediately responded to. Communication was responsive. My purse was found and arrangements for collection was done at my convenience. Truly appreciate this.

### "noticeably grumpy unpleasant"
Rude Male FA using plastic disposable glove move my small bag to side to let other passenger bag squeeze within the overhead compartment. No eye contact when distribute snack and noticeably grumpy unpleasant look to this male FA . Unclear announcement through the flight too.

### "unprofessional and frustrating"
I would avoid this airline at all cost. Our departing flight was delayed three times, and after four hours, we were able to book on another flight with the same airline. They told us they did not know when our replacement aircraft would come, and if we had not initiated the conversation, we would not have even been presented with the option to rebook. Upon returning, our flight was again delayed three times, for a total of 3+ hours. The screen indicated our plane was boarding, at last call, but the attend at the gate had to reassure everyone that our plane had not even arrived yet. Very confusing, and it was unprofessional and frustrating.

### "Worst airline ever"
Not Verified | Worst airline ever. It’s subsidiary of Malaysia Airlines and standard is low. Check in still long queue without any fast check in involved, it’s like in the 90s

### "delays is getting more and more frequent"
Very bad in terms of scheduling, flight delays is getting more and more frequent. No compensations offered. For a domestic flight to miss its schedule that is so frequent shows the airline management has a huge systemic problems.

### Firefly customer review
Not Verified | The flight was terrible! My flight was booked from Malaysia Airlines but was operated by Firefly. The return flight was rescheduled 3 times until our schedules were affected. The total delayed time was almost 8 hours and the total travel time varied from 3hours to 10hours because one of the flight changed from one-way to transfer.

### "Avoid this airline"
Flight delayed by 3 hours. No communication, no compensation. They did not even get a new flight for us. Avoid this airline at all cost.

### "Efficient A to B experience"
Not Verified |  Being able to fly direct between Sabak and Penang, not having to go via KUL is very convenient. If Firefly is a budget carrier, then some of the European ones could learn a thing or two. Efficient A to B experience, with a little comfort thrown in. Recommended

### "Absolutely terrible service"
Cannot reach Customer Service if you have any issue or questions, they have only one communication channel (+603 7845 4543) and when you call there you will listen automated message for hours without being able to connect to a real person. Absolutely terrible service.

### “Terrible experience”
I wasn't allowed to do web check-in. I reached the airport at 6pm for a 9.15pm flight (short-haul 1 hr) only to find out that the flight has been rescheduled to 3.35am, there was no email notification, it was also not updated on live flight status for it's flight number. Firefly's official Singapore contact number listed on their website was no longer in use, as for the Malaysian number nobody picked up after 15 minutes of international call expenses. Terrible experience.

### "inform me about my retime flight"
I received two times a message from Firefly that inform me about my retime flight. The worst thing i called customer service for reconfirm about the retime and I need to wait for almost 15 minutes before i can talk with the staff.

### "Horrible experience with Firefly"
Horrible experience with Firefly. Firstly my flight from Penang to Langkawi on 13 Sept is cancelled 3 days prior to fly day, had to cancel the booking with full refund and then scramble to find an alternative flight on my fly day. I've already booked my hotel and car rental, and unable to change the date, so i had to fly on that day. My return flight on 15 Sept is rescheduled 2 times, from initial 13:40 to 1410 and lastly 1520. To make things worst, the flight delayed and didn't take off until 15:40. There's also problem with disembark, we are not allowed to exit the air bridge and kept locked inside for about 15 minutes. Will avoid Firefly for future travels.

### "Very disappointed"
Not Verified |  Bad service recovery. Upon arrival at airport to check in was told by the staff the flight was delayed from 635pm retimed 11.10pm. No message received from airline. Very disappointed. Despite retimed for sure will be delayed the flight. Will never fly with firefly anymore.

### "Flight time rescheduled"
Not Verified |  Flight time rescheduled. 8 Aug afternoon around 1 pm was departure from Singapore to Penang and it kept on changing and finally flight took off at 9.40 pm.. Today 11 Aug going back to Singapore and flight rescheduled 2 times. Flight time was around. 6.30 changed to 8 pm and now 10 pm. Not sure still it will fly on time. It was my first experience and surely I am not going to take this flight again.

### "no scheduling leeway"
Return flight form Penang to Singapore, originally schedule for 10am, was cancelled 5 days before and we placed on an alternative at 18h35 on the same day. At 2pm on the day of the flight we were informed by sms that the flight was delayed to 12.30am the next morning. From the multiple similar reviews it is obvious this airline has scheduling problems as they are operating on a shoestring with no scheduling leeway. Avoid

### "Frustrating with the flight rescheduled"
Not Verified | This isn't the first time (3rd time) flight rescheduled. Frustrating with the flight rescheduled and unable to request for refund or change flight. It is value for money provided the flight ticket not burst.

### "my flight was cancelled"
I notice my flight was cancelled after checking the gate number at the flight schedule monitor screen in Changi Terminal 2 Airport. I called to Changi Assistance for clarification, unfortunately they said the flight cancelled in their system and they did not know why. They ask me call to Firefly for further action. I bought the flight ticket via Kiwi.com. So I called to Kiwi helpline. They did not know the flight was cancelled until I call. They claimed that the Firefly did not send notice to them. So kiwi.com give me options for my case. Option 1: TOP UP SGD165 additional for AirAsia flight on same night. I checked thru AirAsia App selling the flight ticket at SGd132 only) if I go with this option, I make these IRRESPONSIBLE airline and platform rich without do any works. Option2: get refund but not in full amount. And wait for 90days for them to process. (Yeah collect money instantly, refund took 90days). Why not you collect money 90days later) Moral of the story, DO NOT TAKE FIREFLY FLIGHT ANYMORE AND NO MORE VISIT KIWI.com!! !

### "We were left without information"
Booked via GoToGate, flight was cancelled but Firefly did not inform Changi airport staff, and their Malaysia and Singapore helpline did not work either. We were left without information if flight is available, or delayed, or cancelled, as no one at Changi knew, and Firefly did not answer calls. There were also no ground staff, I requested refund via GoToGate on 2nd June, and GoToGate claims Firefly is not responding According to Changi airport staff. This is not first time this is happening with Firefly, this is a recurring issue with Firefly.

### "book with a reasonable airline"
I was flying on 06/05/2023 from Singapore to Malaysia (SZB) and from Malaysia SZB to Kota Bharu (KBR). The first flight from Singapore to SZB was already changed by Firefly with 30 minutes. Arrived in SZB, Firefly was changing my flight 3! times during waiting for the boarding. First change with 1 hour, second by 30 minutes and third by 20 minutes. Due to the fact, a driver and a ferry to my final destination was waiting for me, it seems like I am not able to make it on time (thanks Firefly) and I was heading to the airport office for help. When asking for a solution, first was - no compensation possible due to technical issues. I have to really make clear, I will be not make it to my final destination and getting a no-show fee and have to pay for the driver twice. What solution they can offer me. I looked into three perplexed faces that couldn't give me an answer. I offered Firefly to take care of it themselves, Firefly would have to pay a separate boat transport of the equivalent of 500 MYR to get me to my destination the same day. However, they could not give me a commitment to cover these costs, instead offered me an overnight stay in a hotel in Kota Bharu and a ride in a cab to it. I tried to explain that my costs are higher than the stay in a rundown hotel and a cab ride there, They would like to find a reasonable solution for both sides and that would be a transport on the same day to my vacation destination. Long story short, I would have to pay for the additional boot transfer myself and could then submit this we hotline and e-mail. One will then consider this separately due to the delays and circumstances. This I did, however I got a ridiculous answer and they offered me a refund of 200 MYR from the 580 MYR I had already paid, which is not even half of my costs. Thus, I am now stuck with additional costs that could have been easily taken over by Firefly to find a reasonable compensation. Just save yourself all this inconvenience and book with a reasonable airline that also have an interest in their customers! I'm done with FIREFLY and all lies and excuses I've heard and read.

### "changing my flight 3 times"
Singapore to Malaysia SZB and from Malaysia SZB to Kota Bharu. The first flight from Singapore to SZB was already changed by Firefly with 30 minutes. Arrived in SZB, Firefly was changing my flight 3 times during waiting for the boarding. First change with 1 hour, second by 30 minutes and third by 20 minutes. Due to the fact, a driver and a ferry to my final destination was waiting for me, it seems like I am not able to make it on time and I was heading to the airport office for help. When asking for a solution, first was - no compensation possible due to technical issues. I have to really make clear, I will be not make it to my final destination and getting a no-show fee and have to pay for the driver twice. What solution they can offer me.

Thus, I am now stuck with additional costs that could have been easily taken over by Firefly to find a reasonable compensation. Just save yourself all this inconvenience and book with a reasonable airline that also have an interest in their customers

### "no direct contact or help"
Firefly had without reason changed their flight from the late evening to early morning, which resulted in me missing the flight. As I had booked through the agent, there was no direct contact or help from the airline, and the agent didn't provide much help either, resulting in me having to book another flight and paying much more, while this flight is considered missed. When I want to contact them from Singapore, the phone number from Singapore listed as their office doesn't work, it does not reach them and is an invalid number. Hence I have no way to resolve my claim or ask for a refund. This is enough reason to make people not buy this airline albeit its low cost. I made a mistake and am never doing that again. Please trust a local budget airline that at least has a workable hotline. Paying an extra $200 for a last minute ticket equates to a non-budget flight price anymore.

### "it was a unique experience"
A boutique airline, managed under Malaysia airlines. Mainly fly within Western Malaysia peninsula, with only one international destination which is Singapore. I appreciate the fact that they use the old Subang airport, and it flies to another little airport and that's Xeletar in Singapore. Check in was done quickly. Boarding process was orderly and smooth. The ATR32 is a small but beautiful plan laid out in a 2x2. The seats are actually quite spacious and good leg room, stewardess are welcoming and hard working, free water and packet of nuts given free. Overall it was a unique experience. This is definitely another great way to travel between these 2 cities. Get a window seat for a great scenic flight experience.

### "Bad weather resulting delay departure"
Flight itself was full. Sitting inside the cabin 20mins for waiting another plane to land so we have had to hold short at the runway longer time. Bad weather resulting delay departure, powerful turbo plane. A small packs of cookies, nuts and drinking water was provided as a refreshment .

### "no explanation, no apologies, just kept silent"
First flight and will be the last. Booked 6pm flight, few hours before received msg that flight will be delayed to 7.15pmm but at 7pm still didn't see the airplane. Asked counter staff, she simply replied that it will arrive in 15 mins. Eventually landed 7.30pm, finished boarding and flew at 7.55pm and reached Senai 8.55pm. I missed the last AA1 8.30pm bus to JB central. Wasted 2 Bus tickets that bought earlier, unable to go back to Singapore the same night as planned and last minute went to a relatives house for a night. Firefly had no courtesy to reply my email, no explanation, no apologies, just kept silent.

### "airline does not even have the courtesy"
The original flight was suppose to depart from Johor at 9am and was initially delayed to 11.45am. Then delayed to 1.15pm and again to 3.15pm. THE airline does not even have the courtesy to inform via email or sms of the delayed. By right that many hours of delay should come with at least a meal voucher. No explanation given.

### "efficiency is maximised"
The biggest selling point for this flight is that it flies between the two smaller airports of the most frequent international flight route in the world, hence efficiency is maximised. True to its promise, the small airports made for a much quicker screening and security process, and my entire door-to-door journey from KL to Singapore (from hotel in KL to second home in Singapore) took just 3 hours and 10 minutes. The flight itself at 65 minutes was rather uneventful, flying an ATR means a lot of compromises, such as barely functioning air-conditioning, smaller seat pitch, a shorter ceiling, much smaller lavatories, etc, which was somewhat uncomfortable, but is a price I would still be willing to pay for the efficiency of the total journey.

### "Never flying with them again"
They charged us 150 RM ($35 USD) each to add our middle names to the ticket. The same cost as the actual flight tickets. I’ve never encountered this with any other airline, and it’s such a blatant money grab. The flight itself wasn’t overly comfortable either, but for a 30 minute trip I don’t mind. Never flying with them again after the experience with customer service.

### "polite and professional"
Subang to Singapore with Firefly. As departure airport is a small airport with little traffic, pushback was quick and flight took off on time, and landed before time. Light refreshments in the form of a snack and a drink were served. There were only 2 cabin crew on this short flight and small aircraft, whom were polite and professional.

### "cabin crews were attentive"
Kota Bahru to Subang. This was my second time on Firefly, the first was the journey from SZB to KBR earlier in the day. The flight was delayed, supposed to depart at 8.45 pm, but only by 9.30 pm that the plane left the airport. Notwithstanding, the flight was okay all the way to SZB. The cabin crews were attentive and landing was smooth.

### "I don’t care attitude"
Kota Bharu to Kuala Kumpur. This is connecting flight from Kota Bharu to Kuala Lumpur (code sharing with Malaysia Airlines on to Osaka). I don’t care attitude of the staff at the counter.

### "didn't respond to my emails"
Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. The airline changed my departure airport and informed me in an email with the subject "Firefly Travel Itinerary". No "changed itinerary", "new itinerary", "updated itinerary" just plain "Firefly Travel Itinerary". The email also contained no indication that anything had changed. As I was already traveling with limited email access and I had receive multiple emails over the preceding months with the same subject, without changes, I only discovered the changed airport at check-in and has to book a second hotel near the new airport losing my money on the first. Customer service didn't respond to my emails either.

### "flight was amazing"
Not Verified | Singapore to Subang. The flight was amazing. Food and beverages very generous for such a short flight. Seat is decent. Cabin crew are frendly. Landing is very smooth. Merchandises are very pretty and cheap. Definitely fly with them again.

### "onboard service was courteous"
SIN-IPH-SIN on 19 and 22 Sep 2018. Check-in at both airports was quick and simple. The free 20kg allowance for checked-in luggage was useful, given the lack of overhead bin space in the ATRs. Boarding was orderly and both flights departed slightly ahead of schedule. The remote stands used by Firefly at Changi Airport are near the runway, so the taxiing time prior to takeoff was minimal. The onboard service was courteous, with the nice bonus of a light snack and drink. The cabin was slightly more cramped and noisy than that of a jet aircraft, but the seats were well-padded and more than adequate for the 1h 40min flying time. Both aircraft were rather worn, but the seats, window shades and overhead bins functioned without issue. Arrival was a few minutes early both ways, with passengers arriving at Changi Airport being dropped off at a special gate a few metres away from immigration at the same level. For the price paid (about SGD 210 per person return), Firefly offered service at a level over and above my expectations for a regional airline.

### "staff on board was nice"
Singapore to Ipoh. What a surprise: first time using this airline and I was very happy. The staff on board was nice The snack for such a short time fight was excellent

### "continue to support Firefly"
Penang to Subang. I was having an accident a month ago, I was walking slowly with my walking pole. There was a Firefly duty manager who noticed me and came to me if I needed assistance. He arranged a wheelchair and two assistants to help me. These two young men were really helpful, they even help me to arrange a Grab car at the kiosk. They even waited for the driver at the arrival hall and help me to load my 2 bags to the cab. Thank you Firefly and the 2 young men. Yes, I'll continue to support Firefly.

### "be using Firefly again"
A convenient flight from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Flight into Subang is convenient as the airport is smaller than KLIA and closer to Kuala Lumpur city. Check in was easy and service on board efficient and friendly. A small snack and a drink offered for no extra charge. This gesture is highly appreciated as this is rarely seen in short haul flights in Europe. I will be using Firefly again.

### "convenient way to travel"
Subang to Penang, a convenient way to travel at a very competitive price. Check in at Subang airport was easy and security queue was quick. Service onboard was friendly and a small snack and a drink provided for no extra charge. Check in was slightly delayed on the return flight from Penang but the agent was apologetic and the rest of the trip went smoothly.

### "a no frills flight"
The one-hour flight from Subang airport in Kuala Lumpur to Singapore is a no frills flight. A snack and drink is offered. A useful tip: passengers are boarded from the rear of the aircraft. The last 3 rows are designated as preferred seats because you are the first to get off the aircraft at your destination.

### "poor management"
Penang to Subang. We have been informed by the crew mentioned that the flight been delayed due to the engineer who supposed to sign the document is absent and we have to wait another 45 minutes, due to ethical and poor management. We can accept any delay due to technical problem, but not this excuse. We regret to express our frustration for the mistake (not present to work) by one single engineer.

### "avoid like the plague"
Booked flight from Koh Samui to Subang in August, and this was cancelled October 2nd, by text message. Said if I wanted to discuss, to call Malaysia - I am in the UK. Text said the fare would be refunded 16th October. This was already unacceptable. Booking a replacement flight cost me double the money as it was booked closer to the time, plus calling Malaysia call centre for Firefly was very expensive. Worse was to follow. After Failfly refused to compensate me, they failed to refund me. They are now saying the refund will take 30 days. Avoid like the plague. Unreliability beggars belief.

### "avoid them if possible"
Krabi to Penang. Risky to book a flight with Firefly. I was called a day before the flight, saying it has been cancelled. Firefly offered to put me on a flight a few days later, but does anyone traveling really have a few extra days to wait for a flight? Not really a viable option in my opinion. In total, I ended up losing $450 due to the last minute flights and travel plans I needed to book with only a day's notice in order to make it to a wedding on time. Overall, I found Firefly has very poor customer service. They were unwilling to reimburse any expenses incurred as a result of their last minute cancellation. I'd avoid them if possible.

### "highly recommended"
Flew Alor Setar to Subang. Have flown with Firefly numerous times before so thought it was about time I wrote a review of their service. Firstly I love travelling with them due to the airport they are based in which is near Kuala Lumpur city centre at Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport, Subang. The airport is small, which makes the experience that much better. An early morning flight means leaving 30-40 mins before the flight as long as I have checked in online. ALso love the fact if I haven't checked in I can also check in the return flight on the outbound sector, saves so much time. Boarding is usually 5-10 mins before stated departure time, which can make some new flyers with them a little jittery. One of the things that strikes me with Firefly is that I have yet to see a male flight attendant and I have to admit being surprised at the number of female pilots flying for this airline, kudos to them. The plane is a small ATR plane and a drink and snack is provided on the short flight. The seat and toilets are very clean. Flight Attendants speak very good english and are very professional. Have had around 20 flights with them in the last 3 years and have yet to complain (there it goes, just as I say it), highly recommended.

### "keep flying this cute airline"
Flew with Firefly on 3 sectors in one day. Firefly notified me by email a month earlier on changes of flight time. To my surprise, they called me 3 days before my flight to remind me the changes. Overall, I love the idea of taking small plane. Everything goes very smooth and fast, from check-in, boarding and taxing etc. Firefly provides more than enough refreshment and drinks onboard. Usually they offered 2 types of refreshment, but on the mid-day flight, they offered three options. Curry puff was the best! Seat quite cramped on -600 plane, but comfy on their old version ATR72-500. Cabin crew professional, well-groomed and approachable. This is my first time to see male cabin crew on Firefly. Too bad it was just a short flight. Will keep flying this cute airline. Hopefully they could revive the jet service.

### "crew were friendly"
First time flying on Firefly and on a ATR 72 from Johor Bahru to Subang. Crew were friendly, flight left on time and got into Subang on time. Ground Crew were friendly. We were offered little snacks - for a short flight, there were 3 options which surprised me. The plane looked a bit tired but really, its only a 1 hour flight.

### "not use this airline again"
I have flown with Firefly in the past and rated them very highly. However, during my most recent trip from Penang to Krabi, my suitcase was badly damaged during the flight and can no longer be used. I reported the problem upon retrieving the suitcase at Krabi airport and completed the complaint form. The staff who dealt with the matter promised that Firefly would contact me to arrange reimbursement but no one has been in touch and, nearly a month later, no one from Firefly's head office has had the courtesy to respond to any of my emails. Will not use this airline again.

### "no complaints at all"
Subang to Langkawi. This was my first time travelling on Firefly and I am very pleased! Getting to check-in and then to the gate was hassle free and the flight was smooth all the way. It was a one hour flight so no IFE but refreshments were served well by a friendly cabin crew. Seats and cabin was clean and comfortable, all in all no complaints at all. Good job on Firefly and may they keep up the good effort!

### "professional and attentive"
Firefly is a very good low-cost airline. Flying from Kuala Lumpur to Kuala Terengganu the the ticket was not very expensive, the airplane quality was good with high standard of cleaniness and comfortable seats. The plane was less noisy than I expected for a propellor airplane. During the flight we were served a complimentary drink and food (I had a curry samosa). Cabin staff was extremely professional and attentive. The big drawback of this airline is the number of flights cancelled - on the way to Kuala Terengganu our flight was cancelled and we were put on a later flight. The day I returned from Kuala Terengganu, out of five daily flights, three were cancelled, one retimed. It seems that the last flight of the day is the most reliable. Despite being a very good quality low-cost airline, it might be unsuitable to those who have time constraints.

### "great value for money"
Check-in process was quick and efficient. The crew were friendly and offered free refreshments for the short journey. On my outbound journey, the weather was very poor but the pilot kept us informed about the situation (as SZB was temporarily closed due to poor visibility) but eventually did get us to the destination. Pilots for both legs were professional and landing was soft. Being able to avoid the hassle of long queues and a shorter travel distance from KL as compared to KL International (KUL), it was great value for money to obtain a ticket that is cheaper than flying SIN-KUL. All these considered, I am happy to fly with Firefly again in the future if flying through KL International is not a must.

### "crew always been professional"
Kuala Namu to Subang, and this is my sixth flight on Firefly and each experience has been wonderful. We departed Kuala Namu (Medan) ahead of schedule and landed in Subang 30 minutes ahead of schedule. I like the 2x2 seating arrangement. The crew has always been most professional.

### "great little airline"
Subang to Penang and Firefly is a great little airline. No fuss but great value for money and frequency to its destinations.

### Firefly customer review
This is the second time I've flown Firefly. Great little airline with friendly flight attendants. The cabin was very clean and the flight deck crew kept us well informed. The ticket prices are cheaper if you book on their website.

### Firefly customer review
Used this airline for the first time June 19 for a flight between Subang airport and Kota Bharu. The staff on-board were friendly and I couldn't believe they served a snack and drinks for a 1 hour flight. The only negative point was that the back of my seat wouldn't stay in an upright position and would slowly recline back. Other than that, I was happy with my choice of airline.

### Firefly customer review
13/1/2015 Firefly from Penang to Krabi. On time with boarding with little fuss. Soya or fruit juice and peanuts were refreshments offered which was enough for the short flight. Great to connect so easily between the two points of Penang and Krabi.

### Firefly customer review
Love this airline! 20kg baggage included. We got to airport early and were able to change to earlier flight no problems. Snacks and drink provided on plane and loveliest staff both on ground and onboard. Very nice new clean and spacious plane. Wish more airlines were like these guys!

We flew from Singapore to Subang on 24th July. Everything was fine! The flight was on time. Everyone boards a bus from a ground level departure gate at Changi. That gate area is air-conditioned and comfortable. There is a toilet there if you need it. Onboard you are served a drink and peanuts or a cake. Before you know it you are flying over KLIA and then over to Subang. That is a small terminal perfectly situated for people staying in Shah Alam Subang PJ  Bangsar or KL Sentral areas. We stayed in Bangsar and got a taxi voucher in the airport for RM 30. I also bought a sim card there. So though small it has all you need to get you on your way. By the way the duty free shop in the terminal has some good prices!

### Firefly customer review
I flew with two friends on Firefly from Penang to Kota Bharu. The service on board was excellent: welcoming staff and a light snack (cookies) and drink. This is a good airline and I do highly recommend. A snack with a drink were serving during a 50" flight. Bravo and please go on with a dedicated customer service!

### Firefly customer review
Flight Subang to Penang on 20th April was on time and crew were friendly even though flight was full. The last flight I took before this departed early in the morning and it was a rush about 6-7 flights departing with around 5 mins gap. The airport needs to add more gates and improve signage to the aircraft. Firefly staff did the best they could and even managed a quick smile. The latest flight took place mid morning and it was not as hectic on departure as the early morning one. Departure from Penang was ok gate was far from the counters and one level down but the aircraft is right in front of the gate! If you are travelling ex-Penang don't go to the gate too early as there is absolutely nothing down there. Prices seem to be lower than before. I remember thinking that the fares were high when I flew them last year but the last few trips were around the $100 (ringgit not USD) mark which is OK.

### Firefly customer review
In 2008 we flew from Penang to Langkawi and were overall satisfied with the flight (short delay). So in December 2013 we decided to book again for a flight from Bangkok to Kota Bharu. In January they called to switch the dates of our flight because the Monday flight was cancelled. In April they called again to cancel the flight destination because of the political situation in Bangkok. This seems a bit strange to me since other airlines still fly out of Bangkok. I think it's more economical reasons. Now I have to wait 30 days to get my money back and book a flight through KL that is almost three times as expensive. So beware before you book with them.

### Firefly customer review
SZB-Subang-Penang return trip: Superb trips clean aircraft on time. Flight attendants were very helpful and appreciate the light refreshments which were factored into the bill. The trip back was even better because we were given the very front seats at no extra cost. I was travelling with my parents who are senior citizens and the ground staff were very alert and upon looking at the I.Cs I gave her at the check in counter she quickly asked if they needed help getting to the aircraft. When I said they were very fit she double checked if they were okay being seated right in front because they had 'to walk a bit further' in a plane which is actually very small. I found it a bit amusing but the politeness and concern is what matter most. Will definitely fly again. The fact that it is based in Subang is also a bonus point for me.

### Firefly customer review
Flew last week from Subang to Singapore. Return flight from Singapore was delayed 2 hours. Today I am travelling from Subang to Singapore on flight FY3515. Flight delayed again for 1 hour. Reason given by desk staff was delay with arrival from Singapore. It is worse than a low cost airline but the price is not low cost. Expensive yet terrible service.

### Firefly customer review
USM-PEN. Quick check in was able to use the Bangkok Airways "lounge" in the airport free wifi drinks and cookies. Flight just over an hour in an ATR-72 turboprop looked fairly new seats comfortable enough for such a short flight. Bumpy ride due to thunderstorms in the area pilots did a good job flying around them as a result arrived slightly late. Overall good service. Would fly with them again.

### Firefly customer review
Recently flew SIN-SZB (Subang) for the first time on Firefly. Excellent choice of timings and departure is from Terminal 2 Changi. Comfortable flight in a propeller plane with a snack of nuts or muffin with juice or soya milk served. The best part is arriving at Subang and in 15 mins after landing I was in the taxi to KL with my luggage. The journey also took only 25 mins to downtown - a far cry from KLIA. Would really use it anytime on this sector.

### Firefly customer review
A great airline for local travel - their flights from Subang mean a 20-30 min cab ride from central KL rather than going to the main airport terminal. Flew SZB to PEN - short flight but the cabin crew were there with a snack. Left perfectly on time.

### Firefly customer review
10/8/12 I flew SZB to PEN. It was a short and pleasant flight there was a snack and refreshments served at no cost cabin staff were pleasant and attention was paid to other passengers storing their bags appropriately. SZB was an easy point of departure the airport being simple and easy to manage there was a slight delay in take off and passengers were informed of proceedings.

### Firefly customer review
AOR-SZB on FY2171/01AUG with the ATR72-500. On time departure with a smooth flight along the way. For the short duration of one hour the FA served very light snacks - peanuts & mini apple with drinks. Before we know it it was already time to land. Definitely the #1 choice for domestic flights when you get their promo fares.

### Firefly customer review
Flew KUA-SIN. Short flight competently managed. We were charged heavily for overweight baggage; 20 kg over for two people; the fee was as much as one ticket. Check in staff and flight crew were friendly and helpful. The ATR turboprop used was as comfortable as expected but this 185 cm passenger asked for the exit row (row 1) after boarding.

### Firefly customer review
SIN-SZB on ATR twin-prop. I got auto-selected for row 11 but decided I wanted a quieter seat and so went to 1D. Flight left late. I'm not sure but perhaps it was because of a heavy thunder storm and arrived late by 10 mins. Boarding was fast and there was a choice of muffin or peanuts guava or mango juice. Flight was reasonably smooth. Luggage came out quickly enough although being 1D means being last at the immigration queue. My hotel was 20 mins away - 45 mins from KLIA - so this was a good fight for me.

### Firefly customer review
The flight was excellent service by flight attendants was wonderful with nice warm friendly staff serving a free light snack and drink. Flying to Koh Samui was the easier way to get to Samui straight from Subang airport in KL to Samui Island in less than 2hours. I would highly recommend Firefly airlines to all as they do fly to many more destination around Malaysia and beyond.

### Firefly customer review
Ground staff in LGK did not provide updates for a 40+ minute delay on a 65 minute flight. When they started boarding more than 200 people stood-up for a 68-seat aircraft. (two flights were posted to the same gate). It was disorganized and no apology offered for the delay! Onboard the flight was great. Attentive FAs. Two types of juice snacks offered. SBZ is a great airport - in a taxi in less than 2 minutes after deplaning!

### Firefly customer review
Excellent service throughout SZB-PEN return. Enjoy their complimentary grape juices nuts and muffin. Quiet cabin and cabin crew were very nice. The fare is cheap too.

### Firefly customer review
KL (Subang) to Kuantan. Very punctual departed according to schedule. The crew were cheery and extremely professional for a flight that was just 50 mins. For a short flight they served a light meal too! Highly recommended.

### Firefly customer review
Singapore to Ipoh using Firefly. Its good value for money despite the airline having a monopoly on this route. I was impressed with the web check-in facility and the direct debit facility that is now available and makes booking a ticket convenient. The stewardesses onboard were professional.

### Firefly customer review
Enjoyed the service onboard my flight from Subang to Singapore. Easy to get to the airport fast check-in tasty muffins served onboard.

### Firefly customer review
KUL-KCH. Firefly has cancelled all B737 routes without informing passengers. Now I'm forced to buy expensive ticket which is 5x more. If they are stopping the routes Firefly should compensate more so that we can get on the next available flight without any fuss. Firefly is responsible for inconvenience caused and a refund on low fares isn't enough to cut it. They should foot the bill for expensive last minute air tickets.

### Firefly customer review
2 flights Batam to KL and Penang to Phuket. Both good value on time and planes new and tidy. Efficient check-in and booking.

### Firefly customer review
SUB-SIN. Subang is the old KL airport and now used as a local / LCC airport - much closer to KL than the new airport. Fares were cheap flight was on time and new ATR 72 a pleasure to fly in. Crew were pleasant - snack was OJ and a piece of cake. Highly recommended for the short flight.

### Firefly customer review
SZB-SIN return. Considering the promotional fares the convenience of Subang Airport as well as the impeccable service for a 70 minutes flight (light snack) Firefly is an excellent option.

### Firefly customer review
Kuala Terengannu to Singapore last month. The flight was on a half-full ATR aircraft. The plane was clean the seats comfortable and the staff friendly and efficient. The flight left on time and arrived a few minutes early. Guava juice served. The ticket price was very inexpensive for what was provided. If this is indicative of Firefly's normal performance it is a great little airline.

### Firefly customer review
Return Subang to Penang. Outward leg fine punctual and efficient but the next day I received a phone call from Firefly to say may return flight to Subang had been cancelled because of technical problems - but they could put me on an earlier to which I agreed. I arrived at Penang airport to find the earlier flight was actually an MAS flight to KLIA. In fairness they paid for a taxi from KLIA to Subang to enable me to collect my car but beware as it is apparently common for Firefly to cancel flights when they have a poor load factor - this information came from a member of their staff.

### Firefly customer review
Penang to Subang (KL) and back to Penang. Flight was around 20 MYR (5USD) more expensive than MAS or Air Asia however since Subang is so much closer to the city I felt it was well worth it. Subang airport has been refurbished and is very modern in comparison to my first visit when FireFly was founded. New ATR 72-500 are also much nicer planes to fly than the old Fokker 50. Check-in was efficient and flights were slightly late boarding but made up time in the air and arrived on time. The crew was friendly and efficient however not as welcoming as the MH crew. (FireFly is a subsidiary of MH). They served fruit juice and a small piece of cake for this 35min trip. Not bad and good value for money.

### Firefly customer review
SIN-KUA-SIN with family + 1 child + 1 infant. Infant seat belts were offered unlike Tiger and Air Asia. ATR72-500 were new (capacity 72 pax). Drinks (OJ or apple juice) peanuts and muffins served with 2 FAs. Drinks were done 2 rounds in the 1 hr flight. FAs were friendly and customer service orientated. Air sick bags and inflight mag were avail in each seat. Flight to Kuantan about 98% full while flight to Singapore was about 90% full. Seats were arranged 2x2. There was 1 toilet available. We paid for S$70 for the promotion return airfares! Overall we enjoyed the flights and will not hesitate to fly with them again.

### Firefly customer review
Penang-Langkawi. New and clean ATR friendly FAs cold drink free service air fare including taxes about £10 each would thoroughly recommend this airline.

### Firefly customer review
Singapore to Kuala Lumpur Subang. Took several round trip flights between Singapore - Budget Terminal and Kuala Lumpur - Subang in July. On time flights new aircraft. Low fares with no extra charges for seating checked baggage or refreshments unlike on budget airlines. In particular departing and arriving at Kuala Lumpur Subang is very quick and much closer to Petaling Jaya and downtown Kuala Lumpur. Only quibbles are that the ATR72 can be bumpy in turbulent weather and that the food (muffin) & drink (juice) onboard are uninspiring. Try to get a seat at the rear of the aircraft as ATR72s only have one door at the rear.

### Firefly customer review
I had the worst experience flying Firefly. Flew to Koh Samui on 8th July with my family for a five day vacation. Was suppose to leave on Sunday (12th July) at 1100 hrs. Flight was delayed to 1530 hours due to bad weather. Was informed later that there was a further delay. My husband called up the Firefly customer service and was informed that the flight was cancelled. Imagine we were all still sitting at the departure hall at 5.00 p.m. and there was no announcement that the flight was cancelled. We were all fuming mad and finally we told the airport officials to check with KL office. They finally called and confirmed that the flight was cancelled and we were told to return the next day. I am truly disappointed with the service. To top it all our ordeal was not over yet the next day we were informed that our flight would be at 6.00p.m instead of 11.20 a.m. as we have not "checked out" yet. We did not understand what the Thai officers were trying to tell us. Wasn't all this technical arrangement suppose to be done automatically for the passengers? We had to wait for another two hours before we finally got our seats! Talk about providing great service!

### Firefly customer review
Kerteh - Subang evening flight departed on time and arrived roughly 5 minutes earlier than expected. Ground service efficient. Check in and boarding without hassle. Plane interior very clean. FAs friendly and service fairly good. Light snacks (biscuits) and drink served promptly after departure. In-flight announcement was a bit hard to understand especially the one made in English seemed like FA in a hurry. Other than that nothing to complain about. For the price they are offering will use them again

### Firefly customer review
I have just returned from a trip to Alor star (AOR) from subang (SZB) and it was a very pleasant flight with FY. Flights took off on time and the crew were friendly and genuine. Overall excellent trip with FY. I wish they flew into KUL as well for easier connections to other points.

### Firefly customer review
Kuala Lumpur to Pekanbaru Indonesia about a one-hour flight. Our plane was scheduled to depart at noon but we arrived to find that the flight had been delayed until 2:30 as one of their airplanes had technical problems and was removed from their fleet of 5 planes. Although we had supplied contact information and they acknowledged that they should have called us to let us know about the delay we received no information. When we did board the flight was nerve-wracking due to turbulence most of the way.

### Firefly customer review
Penang-Langkawi on ATR Flight was on time crew worked excellent together and the flight attendants were cheerfully serving orange juice and water during this 20 minute flight. A very good experience.

### Firefly customer review
Langkawi to Penang. Bargain price of £24 for 2 pax one way. Excellent service took of on time and landed 5 minutes early. (flight time was only 25 mins) check in was simple and no hassle about baggage allowance (we were a tad over but they didn't charge us) Plane looked brand new leather seats very comfortable. Would use again and they can teach some of the British budget airlines a thing or two!

### Firefly customer review
PEN-LGK. A 90 minute delay to a flight of barely 30 mins is not a good start and a load factor of less than 20% doesn't bode well either. Booked last minute and got a bargain fare which made the trip cost only slightly more than the ferry which takes nearly 3 hours. A BOB trolley service came round once but on such a short flight no-one was interested. I had collected my luggage and was in a taxi less than 5 mins after landing. If there had been no delay this would have been a 5 star journey.

### Firefly customer review
Penang-Subang-Penang. Cabin crew helpful and friendly. Starting last month FireFly increase its baggage allowance for check-in baggage from 15kg to 20kg.

### Firefly customer review
Penang - Langkawi. Quick hop over btw the islands. Price very good thru the net. Be careful if you come from a Malaysia Airlines flight to Firefly as baggage allowance is only 15 Kgs. Cost more for 8 Kgs of baggage than the flight. Buy on Board prices good though didn't bother due to it being a short flight. Left 15 mins early landed 30 mins early!

### Firefly customer review
SZB - Lankawi return and SZB - Penang return. Subang airport is peaceful quiet efficient and close to Kuala Lumpur. Check in swift and boarding seamless as seat numbers assigned and the planes are small Fokker 50's. The flights were very comfortable (former MAS seating not budget) with friendly flight attendants. Proper assignation of seat numbers makes such a difference compared to the shambolic scrum at LCC terminal. I hope they expand and operate many more routes from SZB.
