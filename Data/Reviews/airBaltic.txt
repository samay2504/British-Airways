### "charged for every additional kilo you had"
Not Verified |  Terrible customer service. Choose a different airline for your flight. They were already late, yet instead of boarding passengers quickly, they delayed the flight even more by weighing every bag. They charged for every additional kilo you had.

### “The worst service is in Riga Airport”
Not Verified | AirBaltic’s so-called “apologies” for customer claims are nothing but empty words. They respond just to check a box, not to actually solve problems or improve their service. Their actions speak louder than their meaningless “sorry.” The worst service is in Riga Airport! We flew from Amsterdam with a connection in Riga, where every passenger was forced to recheck their hand baggage. Then came the real scam—everyone was forced to pay extra fees! We had bought small gifts at Amsterdam Airport, which were perfectly fine to bring on board. But in Riga? Suddenly, we were told that every single item had to be weighed again. The total limit for both cabin bag AND personal item (yes, even a small bag) was 8 kg. Even 300 grams over? Pay up! And no, you can’t just carry your small purchase separately in your hands—they even weigh what’s in your pockets! So, don’t believe the lies and nonsense from AirBaltic’s CEO, Martin Gauss, when he writes in the magazine about “caring for service and customers.” Their only concern is squeezing every last euro out of passengers. This is a scam, plain and simple!

### “big issue is their customer service”
Air Baltic has an ok service, seats are not so comfortable, but it’s a flyable airline. The big issue is their customer service! My baggage was completely destroyed by the airline handlers. I requested my compensation at the airport, and promptly I entered in contact with air Baltic with the details I received in the airport. I submitted my claim and received an automatic email that told me to go to the near repair shop, and this same repair shop was closed for “holidays”. I couldn’t repair my bag and after almost 15 days I got an answer from the Air Baltic customer service saying the exact same thing, that I should take my baggage to be repaired. However, the baggage can’t be repaired, since it’s destroyed. One wheel was completely removed from the luggage, other parts are completely damaged and another wheel it’s half broken. The luggage it’s unusable and after several emails, till the day of today, I received no answer from the Air Baltic customer service team. It’s a big shame!

### “Shame on you AirBaltic”
It's a shame I cannot recommend this airline for the following reasons. I was due to fly from Belgrade to Riga with AirBaltic in August 2024 with my partner. We are both disabled, were wearing our sunflower lanyards and additionally I was walking with a stick. As we were waiting to board we were called out of line and told that due to overbooking we would not be able to board the flight. I told the staff that we had onward connections booked and we would miss the connections bvecause of this, I also informed them that we're both disabled and we were still denied boarding. This is a breach of the EU261/2004 Article 11 which basically states that disabled persons must be given priority to board over non-disabled passengers. We were then booked onto another flight with a connection in Buidapest to arrive in Riga around 1700 instead of 0600. When I again mentioned the issue of our onward connection we were told that the staff in Riga would help us with this. We were then put on the flight via Budapest. When we arrived in Budapest we requested assistance from the Air Baltic staff we were told to take care of ourselves. At this stage it was obvious we would have to probably stay overnight in Riga and travel onwards the next day to Tallinn. This meant we had to cut Vilnius out of our itinerary and lose a day of our holiday. When we arrived in Riga we were given EU261 compensation of EUR250 for the denied boarding and when I asked for help with the accommodation and the onward travel we were told to book it ourselves and claim it back from AirBaltic. When I tried to claim this back from Air Baltic I was then told that because they had paid us the EUR 250 that they weren't obliged to repay our expenses. When I replied that under EU261/2004 Article 9 the Airline was obliged to provide Accommodation where a stay of one or more nights becomes necessary in addition the Airline was obliged to offer transport between the accommodation and support in the way of telephone calls, emails etc None of this was offered - The only assistance we received was a meal at Belgrade Airport. As far as the Air Baltic staff cared my partner and I could have been wandering the streets of Riga overnight. I replied to Air Baltic quoting the legislation that they had breached and they haven't replied, I wrote to Air Baltic at their Head Office in Riga and they haven't replied. They have also rendered their customer care commitment null and void. Said commitment reads 'If you are involuntarily denied boarding and have complied with our check-in and other applicable rules, we will give you a written statement that describes your rights. We will also rebook you to next fastest connection, offer refreshments, meal, hotel and transportation (if necessary) as well as pay compensation as prescribed by the Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Shame on you AirBaltic - I would have expected better from a national flag carrier.

### "experience on board was pretty nice"
Frankfurt to Vilnius via Riga return. The main issue with this airline is the short connection time, which is guaranteed by the company almost for all destinations. This means, if a single flight in this chain is delayed, all consequent, dependent flights will be delayed as well as they have to wait for passengers from the first leg. As a result, there are huge delays and nervous passengers running through Riga airport to catch their connecting flights. (I need to mention here that the company assists the passengers to transfer as soon as possible: the information about the next flights is given already before the landing, the company's representative meets the passengers near the gate and informs about their connection, etc). What I found also annoying is a very chaotic boarding experience in Vilnius - the passengers entered a bus which rode to the plane position in the airfield, there it stood for 15 mins without opening the doors, then rode back to the airport building, there we had to wait for another 15 mins, then another ride to the plane and finally boarding. They explained that they had to fix some issues with the information system on the plane, but from passenger's view it looked totally out of order. But apart from that, the experience on board was pretty nice: new aircraft, comfortable seats, welcoming and helpful crew.

### "Ticket prices are not high"
Airport Facility 3/5. Check in staff service: 3/5 Staff was not really friendly. Lounge: 3/5 the airport Lounge, not airBaltic. In this Lounge you can find some light snacks and beverages, but the price of entry is not worth it.) Seat comfort 4/5 Seats were good for Economy on domestic European flights.) - Seat pitch: 4/5 (A bit more than enough.) - Legroom: 4/5 (A bit more than on the vast majority of European flights. Cabin safety video/info 4/5 they have video displayed on screens above passengers' seats. Comfort items almost do not exist. Cleanliness: 5/5 Its usually clean on airBaltic flights) Lavatory cleanliness: 4/5 it was clean. Selection of meals (pre-order): 4/5 the passenger has a lot of options. Selection of drinks onboard 4/5 a wide selection, several seasonal drinks are available. Selection of snacks onboard 4/5 different snacks are available and light meals are available. Good quality. Food a bit overpriced. Only one magazine, , but it is mostly advertisement. Wi-Fi was not available on that flight. This airline is good for flights up to 4 hours. Ticket prices are not high, so if person needs to get from point A to point B airBaltic would be a good option.

### “meal arrived completely cold”
Not Verified | On the evening flight a hot meal was ordered and added to the ticket for a 85 year old lady. When the meal arrived it was completely cold and not really appetizing. When stewardess was asked to heat the meal it was answered that only for a business class passengers they can use the microwave. AirBaltic really?

### "overall was a lovely experience"
First time to travel with airBaltic I flew AMS-RIX, then RIX-VNO and finally TLL-AMS as part of my Baltic trip. I was impressed with the aircrafts and their cleanliness of interior. All flights left on time and there was smooth boarding. Seats are comfortable and I loved the fact they still have the inflight magazine. No inflight individual entertainment screens. Food was for purchase which was on for those short flights. The only negative thing was on the TLL-AMS sector bathrooms were not clean. It’s not the airline fault but they should have checked it. And when we arrived in AMS disembarkation took forever as we were waiting for the buses (that’s the airport staff fault). But overall was a lovely experience.

### "denied our rightful claim"
I recently experienced a significant delay with Air Baltic on a flight from Vienna to Riga that was delayed by over 5 hours, causing us to miss our connection and disrupt our entire travel plans. According to EU Regulation 261/2004, we are entitled to compensation since the delay exceeded 5 hours, and we chose not to board the delayed flight due to the impact on our schedule. Despite providing clear evidence of the delay and multiple attempts to assert our rights, Air Baltic has continuously denied our rightful claim for compensation. Their customer service team seems either unwilling or unable to correctly interpret the regulations, and their responses have been dismissive and unhelpful, referring us to dispute resolution bodies rather than addressing the issue directly. It is incredibly disappointing that a major airline would handle such a straightforward case in this manner. The refusal to comply with EU laws and the lack of proper customer service reflect poorly on Air Baltic. I would advise anyone flying with them to be prepared for similar issues, and if your flight is delayed, know that you might face a lengthy battle to receive the compensation you are legally entitled to. I am taking further steps to escalate this issue with the appropriate regulatory authorities and will not be flying with Air Baltic again unless they rectify this situation. Air Baltic, do better for your customers. Compliance with regulations and basic customer service should be a given, not a fight.

### "unwilling to negotiate compensation"
Not Verified |  I am extremely disappointed with AirBaltic's service. The flight I was supposed to take with my family was significantly delayed, and we arrived at our destination 12 hours late. Due to this delay, we lost a day of work, incurred additional travel costs, and had to pay extra for pet sitting. I have made multiple attempts to claim compensation for these expenses, but AirBaltic has refused to reimburse even the meal expenses, despite the fact that we had no opportunity to eat during the 12-hour delay. This is unreasonable and shows poor customer service. All relevant receipts have been submitted, but AirBaltic has been unwilling to negotiate compensation at any level. I will never use AirBaltic's services again. This has been an incredibly frustrating and disappointing experience.

### “Aircraft was immaculate”
Smooth boarding process. Business seats on the A220 are standard European Business, economy with center seat blocked. Aircraft was immaculate. Very warm attentive staff for a 55-minute flight. Never and empty glass and attendants were visible and present for the entire flight. Swiss code share fight.

### “Very warm attentive staff”
Smooth boarding process. Business seats on the A220 are standard European Business, economy with center seat blocked. Aircraft was immaculate. Very warm attentive staff for a 55-minute flight. Never an empty glass and attendants were visible and present for the entire flight. Swiss code share flight.

### "Low cost airline"
Low cost airline. I asked for some water to take medication and the first answer from the crew was that I had to buy one, after complaining that this was a necessity for me to take a pill I was told I could get some free water but that it was not good to drink. What kind of airline is this?

### "One of my favourite airlines"
HEL-RIGA-HEL. Flights on time. Ticket prices affordable. New and clean aircraft. Flight attendants not so smiling but effective. One of my favourite airlines.

### "Flight got canceled"
Flight got canceled. I called airline no one informed about my possibilities for alternative flight. Then day time got notification that alternative flight to Riga via Stockholm will be delayed by 2 hours so had to call again requesting alternative flight via Helsinki. Eventually final flight got delayed by another one hour - common practice as in order to avoid paying compensation they await other passengers with connections.

### "delayed our baggage to Vilnius twice"
AirBaltic delayed our baggage to Vilnius twice (in August and in November). And since Vilnius is not our final destination (we have to take a bus to cross the Schengen border to get to my hometown) we either have to stay and wait for the suitcases to arrive hopefully next day or arrange a suitcase delivery by ourselves. AirBaltic neither compensates any expenses we suffer from their incompetence nor delivers the suitcases to our hometown. Worst service onboard. Vilnius airport Lost & found section is always jammed with people claiming their luggage and suitcases waiting for delivery or pick up. As far as I can see it AirBaltic can forget a suitcase not only in transfer flights but in direct flights to Vilnius. I can't say any good words about KLM as well: we bought tickets from KLM site and expected them to reimburse expenses that we had since AirBaltic was their code sharing partner and European legislation allows us to choose which company to complain to (not only the Montreal convention). But the opened ticket for complaint was promptly closed with "apply to Air Baltic" and no possibility to object or re-submit the complaint with more details.

### "a freezing boarding process"
We were bused to the plane in -18°C/-2°F weather instead of using the tunnel, leaving us outside for at least 10 minutes. Despite Vilnius airport not being busy, this airline opted for a freezing boarding process instead of the standard EU procedure. Although I paid for extra luggage online the day before with receipts, AirBaltic insisted on an additional payment, claiming they couldn't see the initial one, despite sending a receipt the day before. Additionally, the airline doesn't offer complimentary water.

### "refusing to send the stroller back"
Not Verified |  Went on holiday with my husband and our 1 year old. We checked the stroller at the gate but turns out you can't pick it up at the gate at Schiphol so we went to baggage claim (half an airport away) where only the top seat of the stroller arrived. Called and wrote AirBaltic for support, followed all the instructions, finally after a ton of investigative work on my part found out that both parts have been sent back to Riga (3 weeks after the flight). Now AirBaltic is refusing to send the stroller back to me and requires me to come pick it up at the airport... with a baby...without a stroller. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy the stroller has been found, but this is not a good policy. No apology from the airline for the inconvenience of course.

### "mishandled baggage and compensation policy"
I am writing this review to share my deeply unsatisfactory experience with AirBaltic regarding mishandled baggage and the compensation policy they offer. During a recent trip, my wife and I faced a series of mishaps with AirBaltic. Despite correctly registering our baggage, it was not delivered as expected. Our baggage only arrived 22 days after it was “mishandled” causing significant inconvenience. The subsequent lack of accurate information and delayed communication compounded our frustrations. To make matters worse, the compensation offered by AirBaltic amounted to a mere 40 Euros per passenger, irrespective of the extent of the inconvenience caused. It is disheartening to note that AirBaltic's compensation policy, as evidenced by my experience, remains fixed at a total of 40 Euros per passenger regardless of the circumstances or the expenses incurred due to their mishandling. The company's failure to effectively implement the "all possible measures" required by the Montreal Convention raises serious concerns about their commitment to passenger satisfaction and adherence to international aviation standards. It is essential to be aware of the policies and standards upheld by airlines to make informed decisions and ensure a stress-free travel experience. Please learn from my experience and consider other options to avoid potential disappointment and inconvenience during your travels. Safe travels, and may your journey be far smoother than mine.

### "No service, narrow seats"
Worst airline ever. No service, narrow seats, delay, customer service very unfriendly or not willing to listen. Worst is that they think they are ood… likely just asked own staff and their family

### "The airline to avoid"
I have to fly often on ZRH-BEG-ZRH route. Unfortunately, Swiss has outsourced this route to airBaltic. If I had a choice I would never fly this airline again. The flight BEG-ZRH is never less than 1h late, usually more. Once they couldn't land in BEG for some invented reason and took us to Zagreb instead (it's less than 400 km away). After landing in Zagreb, they somehow "decided" that the best course of action was to take us back to Zurich and let us all call the call centre tomorrow and figure out how to get back to Belgrade. Passengers had to fight the crew and especially the rude pilot to be let off the plane in Zagreb and to be able to find their own way to Belgrade (again, less than 400 km away, so there are options like rent a car which are completely viable). Switzerland and Croatia are both within Schengen so there are no immigration issues, it was just the flight deck not wanting to deal with stuff and wanting to take the easy way out. The only positive things I can say is that the crew is usually nice and friendly and that the planes on this route are brand new A220 which are pretty comfortable and nice. But that's not enough. The airline to avoid at all costs!

### "it is my favorite airline"
I have flown with them 30+ times. Honestly, it is my favorite airline. The sweet and sour chicken is amazing. It is very clean! Did not have any problem with the staff on this flight or any other flights. 10/10 airline

### "Customer service was no help"
When we first booked the review in early 2023 we got an e-mail with Book Ref number, suddenly 36h before check-in that book ref number had changed and the one given in e-mail was no longer working in addition they also changed my AirBaltic Club number to something completely different (the one on ticket does not match the one on profile) and also under Profile the ticket info was not shown at all - Customer service was no help there. About Trip: After getting everything done with check-ins the trip went smoothly until return flight where cabin crew did not make sure that people keep their windows open. Several people around my Seat (front and rear) had windows "closed" which caused massive amount of pain in ears to deal with on landing. I will say that the Cabin crew initially did check that windows are open and seatbelts on but after they left for their own seats did those people "close" the windows, since plane was doing landing at that time then hailing the cabin crew (with the button above the seat) to inform them did not help also.

### "refused to refund all the ticket price"
Flights were shown as operated by Air Baltic but as soon as payment was made received an email saying that the flights would be operated by Avion Express. The website did not say this, even though it was known to Air Baltic. Misleading. Air Baltic have refused to refund all the ticket price and also refused to transfer onto other Air Baltic flights. Very bad customer service. Will avoid in future.

### "€70 for airport check-in"
They didn’t send any check-in information on email or SMS, like every other airline company I’ve travelled with does. Then they charged us an extra €70 for airport check-in.

### "a splendid surprise"
What a splendid surprise. airBaltic has leased plenty of aircrafts for summer 2023. First leg was Cyprus Airways. Old plane and the cabin attendants looked like suffering from the work. Oh take me back to warm Cyprus. Last leg by Carpatair. First class service with smiles and a new aircraft. I am now giving 10 points because there's was absolutely something extra ordinary offered by AirBaltic. Otherwise you're normally just sitting bored at the plane at least in economy class.

### "delayed by more than two hours"
Not Verified |  Flight from Riga to Munich. Should have been leaving at 5.35 pm, when we got to the airport, no indication of delay, however, flight was delayed by more than two hours, no room for hand luggage, got stored throughout the aircraft, when asked for this staff super unfriendly, said you can wait when leaving the aircraft

### "they cancelled the flight"
I booked AirBaltic Flight to travel from Berlin to Riga and two hour before the departure they cancelled the flight. I had a very important appointment at the Embassy regarding my Visa renewal. Because of their Flight cancellation I missed my appointment and the next appointment which I got after 4 weeks. Because of their cancellation I have to reschedule and re-book whole travel and accommodation. When I claim for my compensation they’re not ready to pay

### "Dubai to Riga delayed by 2 hours"
Not Verified |  Tallinn to Dubai. Departure time on second leg Riga to Tallinn changed 3 times. One day before departure flight Tallinn to Riga cancelled so I had to call and rebook to an earlier flight. Stay over instead of one hour, now 8 hours. Flight back from Dubai to Riga delayed by 2 hours and flight from Riga delayed by 2 hours. All that without as much as a free drink for 2 Euros offered. A free upgrade not to dream of. I can say easily the worst airline in Europe.

### "an airline that is best to be avoided"
6+ hour tourist route from Riga to Tenerife with one operational toilet in economy class, the other being "temporarily" closed. What a shame. People queueing up to row 20, entry into business class lavatory was firmly declined. Pre-ordered food was delivered by some random schedule across the plane, taking over two hours to be received and several check of the boarding pass (knowing the seat should have suffices). Add to that the not too unusual rudeness of some of the flight attendants and non existing leg space (on a mid-haul flight) - you get an airline that is best to be avoided.

### "No apologies or refunds provided"
Had a good prior experience with this airline but after not allowing me to board on the flight I simply cannot recommend travellers to use this company. No apologies or refunds provided either.

### "Would recommend and book again"
Not bad if you can find a flight at the right price point. Return flight ARN-DXB via Riga. Okay, lets get the worse thing out of the way - one toilet for a 7.20 hour flight does not make the grade. On the positive side. All flights were on time. Equipment is new. Both check in and cabin staff were better than average and price was exceptional compared with the premium carriers. No luggage police were on duty (unlike Ryanair). Seats a tad uncomfortable for the duration but reasonable legroom. Would recommend and book again

### "how easy it was to talk to airline"
Nice new plane. My flight was delayed over 3h, but what surprised me was how easy it was to talk to airline about that. I got clear instructions what to expect during delay when I called customer service. Also I did not have to jump through any hoops when requested compensation - all done in a simple form and without any issues.

### "couldn't explain why the flight was cancelled"
Not Verified |  The flight was cancelled and I was only informed 2 days before the flight. I have completed their claim form for the compensation as I am entitled to it. But now they are stating that I was sent a cancellation message on 20 June, which is a lie. Up until now they couldn't explain why the flight was cancelled, and couldn't explain why I was only informed 2 days before the cancelled flight.

### "decent, but nothing great to remember"
Vilnius to Dusseldorf via Riga. Decent airline, all good but nothing special. A220 are fairly new, good seats, plenty space in the overhead bins even when boarding late. Crew professional. Low cost on board product, very easy to understand: You get nothing included. But that wasn’t a surprise as this was made clear during booking an the many upselling attempts via email. Even without buying a seat reservation there were plenty seats to choose from during online check in at no charge. No playing games or hassle concerning luggage at drop off. First leg a bit delayed, stopover in Riga (within Schengen) easy and well organized. Overall decent, but nothing great to remember. Can recommend to fly, if the price is right.

### "do not offer free glass of water"
Not Verified |  Everything was nice and fast until we got into the airplane. On speaker they said we will leave in 10min, but instead we waited for an hour to depart (without any one saying why). So toilet for an hour was unavailable. Flight cost 300$ from Paris to Rīga and airBaltic do not offer free glass of water. It just felt cheap for what I paid.

### "received no attention whatsoever"
Not Verified |  Being unfamiliar with eastern European airlines, and booking myself from Canada, I chose AirBaltic for times and cost. A huge mistake! My dislike began at checkin at Gatwick airport, when the young woman at the desk looked at my passport, determined that I was a North American, and was therefore beneath contempt. She screamed at me, "Do you have a visa for Russia? I said, "I am not so dumb as to go to this country without one. Then she put a tag on one of my bags, but not on the other. When I pointed this one, she grabbed the untagged bag, and nearly ripped it. On the aircraft I received no attention whatsoever. At Riga things improved somewhat, as a staff member met me and showed me where to board my connection. The flight from Riga to Moscow was without any assistance or comment from the staff. At Sheremetyevo it took ninety minutes for my luggage to be delivered, at 1.15 a.m.

### "plane was other company plane"
Not Verified |  First at all checking in by internet was disaster site not working, charging extra money for no reason etc. Airline send mails to buy food on board. At airport we discovered that plane from Riga is late. but biggest surprise was on boarding -instead airbaltic plane was other company plane. At least plane and staff was ok. Biggest surprise was in Riga. We booked airbaltic and we found old old old Aircarpat fokker 100 instead. The plane so old and dirty. It was worst flight in my life. Try to avoid this conection in Riga because carpat air plane is not plane you want to fly.

### "15 hours late arriving in Finland"
The flight from Larnaca to Riga was about 2 hours late and there was no time for a connecting flight from Riga to Helsinki. The plane was told a completely wrong gate where we have to go and there was no connecting flight. In the middle of the night at Riga Airport without any information on how to proceed how to get home. No notifications were received by phone or email. Three hours of searching for information and bags at the hotel to sleep and finally 15 hours late arriving in Finland. I asked Airbaltic how they like to fix this. No answer

### "plane was new and had decent leg room"
Surprisingly, check in counters only opened 2 hours ahead at Amsterdam Schiphol (even though websites state the counters open 3 hours before departure). The plane was new and had decent leg room, much better than most intra-EU short haul flights. It was also clean with comfortable seats, however passengers were randomly changing to other seats. No complimentary food or drinks - even a coffee will set you back 3.50 euros.

### "seats are surprisingly comfortable"
Compared to many low-cost airlines in Europe, the service is much better, both ground service and onboard, reasonably fast boarding, and none of the usual struggles with luggage that one sees with other low-cost carriers. The A220 really makes most of the difference, the cabin feels more spacious and bright, than A320 and B737, there is plenty of room in the overhead compartment, and the seats are surprisingly comfortable (at least in short-haul flights), with ample legroom and the possibility to recline the backrest. There was a decent selection of food for purchase onboard but nothing special. There is WiFI onboard but no internet, so you can only access the same sort of information that you have on the onboard magazine, it seems like a lost opportunity.

### "very good if the price is right"
The good news first. Fresh and tidy brand new planes, punctual departures and arrivals, ok boarding procedures, very good legroom and seat comfort, clean toilets and nice crews. The sad part: overpriced hand bag extra weight allowance (with very mingy regular allowance), exorbitant baggage charges that make your ticket really over what Lufthansa charges, very mediocre organisation of transit procedures in Vilnius. Overall very good if the price is right. Wifi was advertised but didn’t work on the both flights.

### "I will never fly with them again"
Our luggage and that of 67 other passengers was not loaded on the flight. Over 24 hours have passed and no update or communication from Air Baltic. I have spoken to people in Tallinn, Latvia and their agent in London. Nobody can advise or help in any way. The airbaltic tracker of missing luggage has not been updated since it was reported directly after the flight landed. Most of the effected passengers are competing in a sports event in Tallinn this weekend. Without our luggage we are unable to compete. 6 months of training and thousands of pounds are wasted. It is assumed airbaltic sold more luggage (because of bike boxes) to passengers knowing that there was no way the aircraft could have carried such a volume. They should never have sold the tickets and I will never fly with them again.

### "seats are very comfortable"
Not Verified |  The staff is great, very kind and helpful, they give out free tea and sandwiches. The seats are very comfortable, The entertainment is decent, if you are going to fly this airline then I recommend taking a laptop or a tablet with you. The plane is quite quiet and fast. Overall 8/10 airline.

### "lately they introduced couple of changes"
Well normally I am happy about the nice and friendly air Baltic service. But lately they introduced couple of changes. 1) 8 kg for the hand baggage, all handbags incl. tax free stuff you bought in the shop. I paid 200 Euro for the return flight. I had to add extra money to be able to take the stuff that I needed with me. Common for high pricing tickets, you should allow more hand luggage. 2) If the hand luggage is a bit more than 8 kg, at the airport you have to pay 60 euro extra. That would mean, you can take only very few things with you and you can’t go shopping at the tax free. 3) These hard conditions are super stressful and no fun more fun to travel anymore with this airline.

### airBaltic customer review
Not Verified |  I had a business trip from Stockholm to London, I entered the cabin of my airBaltic flight the cabin was great and the seats and lighting were perfect, especially the massive windows which were a nice touch to my flight. The take off was smooth there was no turbulence, my pre-ordered food was delicious and the cabin crew were so nice and kind. The descent and landing was smooth. Its very cheap for its comfort, its hard to believe such a small airline is so good! I hope that airbaltic will expand more and get more aircrafts.

### "Cabin was clean"
airBaltic provides at Checkin and Boarding hand  sanitizer and pleasant experience. On board each passenger gets an envelope with two facemasks and two disinfection tissues. Cabin was clean. Bathroom one of be largest I have seen with soap and hand sanitizer. Full service which you have to pay for.

### "Very poor service"
They cancelled my flight and would only offer an 80 euro refund. The flight was 450 euro. The customer service was very poor in dealing with this matter. I was outraged and still haven’t received my 80 euro! They’re a scamming airline. Very poor service.

### "won't refund the baggage fee"
My flights were cancelled yet airbaltic won't refund the baggage fee; is that not insane. I have filed a complaint with the Latvian Consumer Protection Agency: Rule 261 provides for refunds for any flights that arrive into, travel through or depart Europe. On March 18, 2020 the European Union issued a clarification to Rule 261 reiterating that cancelled flights are eligible for refund to the original form of payment. To file a Rule 261 complaint you are directed to send an email to the country’s governing body for each airline or for the gateway or destination of your flight.

### "refused to give me a refund"
Warsaw to Almaty via Riga. I was cheated by the airline. Because of the coronavirus, all flights got canceled as borders remain closed and yet, the airline refused to give me a refund even if I asked them a few times to do so. Never again!

### "60 euros for 3 kilos extra"
Not Verified |  Nice to Riga via Tallinn. It's a shame to pay 60 euros for 3 kilos extra, for items I purchased at the duty free. This is not acceptable. airbaltic only care about money. Never again.

### "Quite a nice experience"
Palanga to Saint Petersburg via Riga. Quite a nice experience. Air baltic provides an awesome connectivity around the baltic states and beyond. Check in, boarding, staff. Choice of planes is quite a pleasure; specially the A220; huge windows, great seat pitch, mood lighting, etc etc. The only downside is pricing. Its certainly not cheap, specially if you need to add check in luggage, meals, seat selection or overweight hand luggage.

### "Rip off and scam"
Rip off and scam. Be aware. Warning. This company is a rip off like some others once your bags are overweight. I paid 60 Euro for 7 kg overweight. Today with people anyway not flying because of fear this shows how this company works and how they treat their customers in today's environment. I just can hope that airbaltic will suffer with this policy. A nice move would be a warning and wish a good flight.

### "luggage weighs few kg extra"
Riga to Zurich. Company is a joke. Hand luggage weighs few kg extra and they have the cheek to charge 60 Euro! Better take any other company and pay more and be comfortable instead of this airline. Worst customer service I’ve seen from an airline. You take money and then have the audacity to be sarcastic to the customer?

### "fee for a checked baggage"
St-Petersburg to Brussels via Riga. At the departure of the airport of St-Petersburg, I had to pay for a supplementary fee for a checked baggage instead of a carry-on baggage even if it was one of the correct size. As I did not want to miss my flight, the officer did not hear any of my argument and forced me to pay the 60€ fee instead of the 16€ fee for an overweight luggage, without any regard for my consent. As this kind of behavior is qualified as a scam, I am truly offended by this event. I strongly do no recommend this company which does not respect the EU consumers' rights. I hope you will avoid it as much as it is possible.

### "humiliating flight experience"
Riga to Paris. I just had the most humiliating flight experience. The ground service team (gate control) before letting people on board is just terrible. First of all everyone got their hand luggage checked with a ride attitude, and if you even had 100 grams over the absurd 8 kg limit, you must pay 60 euros to get in. that 8 kg limit also includes anything you bought in the duty free store in the airport. Now to my experience flying with my already small violin case. As in most airlines, musicians, most specifically violin players are allowed to bring their violin case on board without extra charge, because if you can't place it in the overhead locker (if it is already full because of other people luggage) then it just easily goes under the seat. That being said, the flight was half empty. And the boarding gate control knew it. Nonetheless, they looked for every opportunity to cash money in. But with music instruments is a whole another thing. You see, we cannot allow them to be placed in the hold. There are countless examples the one of a kind and highly valuable wooden music instruments that get placed in the hold are crushed or beyond repair, because of the temperature and the their fragile state. That's why also oversized music instruments, such as cellos, can be taken on board. The most horrible thing is that the gate control had the audacity to demand me payment without even letting me see the rules about music instruments. And they demanded that the already small violin case is being taken in to the hold. With the knowledge that the flight is half empty! I don't understand how cruel a person can be. And if it were not for the understanding stewardess, then we would not be taking the flight.

### "very reasonable price"
Vilnius to Berlin a very pleasant flight. Since my last experience with airBaltic they have updated their fleet with new A220-300s. The procedure of online check-in is very clear and quick, and for now it's possible to use a mobile boarding pass -  not required to print it. The flight was punctual, smooth and uneventful. A220 is a nice aircraft, rather quiet, seats are very comfortable and spacious. All ground and cabin staff were polite and helpful. And a very reasonable price. Will definitely fly airBaltic again.

### "flights were very good"
Berlin to Tallinn. I found the service professional. The cabin crew and the airport staff were friendly. The flights were very good. One thing needs to be improved. I prefer that there is no change of gate at the airport which happened in both of my trips.

### "additional €60 for my cabin luggage"
Vilnius to Amsterdam. I was charged an additional €60 for my cabin luggage such was 10kg in a normal Samsonite cabin sized suitcase. Apparently their policy is to allow only 8kg? I have never had my bag weighed by any other airline. Why should 2kg matter. I won't fly with Air Baltic again. Its not about the money ... its the feeling of being fleeced by am unscrupulous operator.

### "more attention to ground service"
Brussels to Riga. Planes are mainly comfortable and crew onboard is nice and friendly. Food and beverages what you can buy onboard is also good. Flying is good and comfortable, but check-in and boarding are below average. I have been flying all over the world the last 10 years. So I share my last experience with Air Baltic. My flight from Brussels to Riga should depart 9.55. Real-life we depart 10.15. Not so big deal we arrived on time. I was 07.30 in the airport to do check-in. After my arrive check-in just opened. Before me was 9 persons to check-in. Then I was next in line and check-in lady was replaced. The new lady lost her ID card so she was unable to do any check-ins. So lady before and the new lady walked away and they only say somebody will be here. So finally check-in was done. They check in 10 persons with one hour. Then I go shopping and then boarding was announced and everyone told to be quick so we can depart on time. Never heard that kind of announcements before. May by Air Baltic you change your boarding system. It is unacceptable to say that kind off announcement in my opinion. I have used Air Baltic before 4 times and every single time I had some issues in check-in. It looks like that their check-in and ground service is really below average. So also we wait for 1 hrs for our check-in luggage at Riga airport. So if you are ready to deal all that crap before the flight for low-cost flights I recommend Air Baltic. I rate planes and comfort on flight 4 but ground service -1 so the total score is 2. If they but more attention to ground service I think they will be a much better airline. Air Baltic first opinion is most important. I hope that in future if I use your service again I get a better experience.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Helsinki to Barcelona via Riga. Having gone with them twice before and being disappointed both times i reluctantly gave them another shot, and how i wish hadn't. These guys are literally unbeatable at the level of unfriendliness to people. Right at check in, despite having put extra care into my weight limits and allowance (i booked an extra seat for musical instruments) i got second-guessed and barked at. The cabin crew were ill spirited and seemed annoyed at the sheer presence of people. It doesn't hurt to treat each other as human beings, does it? Dont give these guys your money. Avoid at all costs.

### "Avoid at any cost!"
Never flying with airBaltic again! I flew with them from Vienna to Riga, in October. One of the worst travel experiences. They lost my baggage, returned it five days later, visibly damaged, and said they can only reimburse the expenses I made (clothes and personal hygiene items, since I was left in Latvia with zero belongings) up to 40 EUR, and only for personal hygiene items. As for the luggage, they said I should fix it at one of their partners, who just so happen not to have offices in my country. They are quoting a law from 1999 and hide behind the ”we did everything that was possible” disclaimer in order to avoid responsibility. Avoid at any cost!

### "inconsistent customer experience!
Riga to Oslo. Very poor and inconsistent customer experience. Was told at the departure airport that my hand luggage would be fine and quicker as I had short transits, since I was eligible for checked in baggage but didn’t have any. Then got charged at the gate of Riga airport.

### "stay away from airBaltic"
Cheap airline, will never use them again. Started weighing carry on baggage at the time it was time to board airplane. It leaves you no time and no option to take anything out of carry on bag, if it has overweight, because simply you have no place to leave your belongings. So you have no other choice than just pay 60 eur ,and check in your carry on bag. Usually other airlines check your carry on bag at the time you get tickets, so you can take anything out if you need to and put it into your check in luggage, but this airline does it at the boarding time, so they could make that extra 60 eur from you. There plenty of good airlines around, so stay away from airBaltic, if you have an option.

### " Absolute nightmare"
Not Verified |  Riga to Gatwick. Never flying with Air Baltic again. Made a whole load of people check and weigh their luggage. I knew I was slightly over the weight (400g) so removed something from my bag and then put on my pocket. Partner had to remove things and add to my bag to make his fit though it was fine on the way out. Then they reweighed mine. Luckily ok. Absolute nightmare and they were charging people €60 a pop!

### "indifferent and unsmiling"
Athens to Hamburg via Riga. Red eye flight on A220-300, plane looks nice but noisy for such a modern plane. You could have slept from 4-6 in the morning but the noise was bothering you. Flight attendants were indifferent and unsmiling. They do not offer even a glass of water or coffee, you have to buy everything.

### "a 3 hour flight was terrible"
Riga to Tbilisi. My first flight with AirBatic went smoothly, but that was only 35mins. But a 3 hour flight was terrible. The plane was the hottest plane I have ever flown on. To the point it was making me feel physically sick. The cabin is a 2-3 layout. But the air con for the aisle seat on the three is non existent. I felt the seat were also uncomfy. True design of the seats is truly awful.

### "flight ran rather smoothly"
Tallin to Riga, this specific flight ran rather smoothly. As you would expect from a flight that is only 30mins. No problem with boarding. No real issue of note.

### "prices weren't the best but it's okay"
Gatwick to Riga. This airline is pleasantly surprising. The value of money wasn't bad but not great,  this is the only route to Riga from Gatwick so the prices weren't the best but it's okay. Ground service wasn't much as a half-budget airline, but the crew does seem very nice. The seat is very comfortable as a modern aircraft with mood lighting and everything making the atmosphere nice with music and small TV screens showing flight progress as well as time etc. Food-wise, as this half-budget airline, of course, it has paid for meals. The value of them is considerably better if we compare it to say Ryanair or EasyJet. If you don't like to wait for your food to be reheated, don't buy the sweet and sour chicken with rice, yes it's good but if you don't like waiting, try avoiding it and buy something like a soup or a wrap, both of which my mum tried and enjoyed very much. The chicken and rice were on point! I'm quite biased as a Latvian myself but I'd recommend flying this airline.

### "Bad service of the staff"
Stuttgart to Riga. Bad service of the staff. I bought the tickets for my mother to visit me and due to her poor English language knowledge I reserved seat for extra cost so that I could print her tickets in advance. At Stuttgart airport flight 262 14:25 (terminal 3) my mothers tickets were initially not accepted and the entrance in the plane delayed. The staff did not support her on this until after all the other people had entered the plane. She was distressed and helpless. Eventually she was let on the flight and the seat I had booked was still for her available. I do not understand how this my so called priority booking for her turned out in such disaster of cancelled ticket that was not recognised by the crew.

### "Completely chaotic"
Riga to Munich. Delayed by more than 30 min. Completely chaotic at the Riga airport at the gate. First, a gate change at boarding time was announced (as if the airline does not know before). Then before boarding started two very unpleasant air Baltic staff made people weight their carry on and make them pay in case carry on had overweight. But instead of putting it in the airplane belly, they let people bring their oversized and over weighted luggage into the completely full airplane. Obviously, there was again total chaos on the plane because of too little space. Although airplane seems to be ready, we did not board for mor than 30 min. I had the feeing they first want to check every carry on for oversize and weight. Staff on the plane was very unfriendly too. In total a very unpleasant flight. I cannot recommend!

### "was expecting better service"
Paris to Riga. I was expecting better service from Airbaltic since I paid more for business class. It turns out the service is worse than budget airlines. Worst airline ever I have taken. I had to remove and put the luggage onto the belt a few time and the ground staff made no attempt to help me with my heavy luggage. He sat and watched and kept commanding me to put the luggage onto the belt even after I asked nicely “would you please help me with the luggage”. After he told me that his name is Keith when I asked him, he turned to talked to his colleagues in French and they all started laughing. I know he was talking about me asking his name because I heard Keith in the conversation, which made me suspect that Keith is not his real name. The English proficiency of ground staff is very low. They spoke in broken English and couldn’t explain to me clearing. The manager thought that my English is not good and explained to me the whole situation again in writing. For info, English is the first language in Singapore. The staff made only me measure my hand carry and claimed that it’s oversized. I saw some other passengers hand carry luggage were clearly oversized too but they are allowed. They initially told me that I have to pay 55EUR for the extra luggage and then changed this to 60EUR when another manager was present and insisted that he told me that it was 55EUR. The air stewardess skipped me when serving the welcome drink and the menu. When I asked for them, she then checked my seat number. How is it that you do not even know who are your business class customers? I did not pay extra for business class for the above poor services. It is very unprofessional to treat your business class passengers with such poor services because she is Asian.

### "Why so cheap?"
Not Verified |  Tallinn to Milan. I was dreading flying with it. For a cause, I was forced to fly with it. Why so cheap? No normal beverages or food on the plane and then you have to pay 60 euros even if you've paid for your carry-on luggage? Why do you have to do it?

### "been denied boarding"
Moscow to London via Riga. Worst airline in the world! I've been denied boarding to the connecting flight in Riga without an explanation. After spending 6 hours in the airport with my mother, we've been told that are fine to go, then they sent us back to Moscow instead of the onward journey. Avoid at all costs

### "make money on extra weight luggage"
Riga to St Petersburgh. Airbaltic has no idea what good customer service mean. They  have no exchange policy on ticket that cost more then 400$. They trying to make money just ripping off they clients and not providing excellent service. Terrible to make money on clients on extra hand weight luggage.

### "not a smile or goodbye from the flight attendants"
Not Verified |  Berlin to Vilnius with airBaltic. Delayed by 45 minutes. Short flight. Seats were narrow and very little leg room. I noticed 4 flight attendants - 3 male and 1 female. 2 of the 3 male flight attendants attended the business class passengers, which there were none. They sat at the business class seats for the majority of the flight. The other male and 1 female flight attendants started selling drinks. When we deplaned, not a smile or goodbye from the flight attendants. It's ok. They probably didn't speak English.

### "won't recommend this company"
Vilnius to Berlin. We really can't recommend AirBaltic to anyone. Short: They are cheating with their scales, showing two kg more than the actual weight of your baggage to threat you with paying 60€ extra. Both flights were delayed. The service on the plane is lacking everything. Detailed: We were two persons checking in one baggage. At the check-in shelter we got told to reorganize our belongings since the baggage was too heavy (allowed are 20 kg for the checked-in and 8 kg in total for the hand luggage). We stepped aside and used the scale next to the AirBaltic shelter to make sure our baggage would fit into the weight limit. After putting on another layer of clothes and reorganizing our belongings, we double-checked the kilograms with that scale. Back at the check-in shelter their scale suddenly showed 2 kg more again. Same with the hand luggage! Both had "overweight" even though we just checked it at the scale next to it! AirBaltic is cheating with their scales. I was too confused to say something, but the grumpy guy at the shelter was "nice" to only give a threatening warning for next time. After getting to the gate we put off the additional clothes that we put on to save weight in the luggage (We are thin people, don't blame us for that), but they checked the hand-luggage of each passenger again while boarding. Many people got charged for overweight luggage and had to pay 60€, if they wanted to get into the plane. That was stressing us out, we put back on all the clothes, only to put them off again after passing the check. Never had such a stressful boarding in my life! Flying back and forth with AirBaltic, both the connections were delayed (Maybe due to checking the passengers' luggage twice). While waiting for boarding, there was no person to answer questions and no excuse given for the irritating delay. While flying you don't get any free drinks, even for water they make you pay extra. The seats are too narrow and make you sit very stiff and compact to not disturb anyone else. For choosing a seat on your own, o wonder, they make you pay extra. The seats are listed in different price categories. It was the cheapest connection we found, but after this horrible experience we will never decide for AirBaltic again and won't recommend this company.

### "Friendly and efficient crew"
An excellent flight from Riga to Copenhagen. Friendly and efficient crew, and great legroom. Flight was very punctual. My only criticism is that the 737 on this flight was 20 years old, so quite worn.

### "charges every singe extra gram"
Riga to Geneva. Airline charges every singe extra gram, including any  Tax Free shop acquisitions (60€/luggage). Staff attitude is very unpleasant. Unless required, won’t use this airline again.

### "Terrible service!"
Riga to Oslo. Terrible service! All passengers checked and charged 60 euro for overweight, even if only 1kg, jackets, pocket contents and the book in your hand included. Passengers that took their clothes on accused by the company representative for being childish. If checking in less than one hour before departure you get charged 35 extra euros.

### "Fix your attitude!"
Not Verified |  Vilnius to Amsterdam. The weighing of hand luggage created huge lines, people were irritated and were made to pay huge fees. If you fly from other countries with AirBaltic they never weigh and create such bad situations. Only in Lithuania! Fix your attitude!

### "they made me pay 60€"
Tel Aviv to Tallinn via Riga. My cabin luggage was 400g overweight and they made me pay 60€, while saying that if you don't you won't get to the flight. At the same time they knew that flight was being delayed! I had friends who could deliver those overweight things to me next week for free!

### "try to avoid in the future"
Not Verified |  Riga to Frankfurt. We were forced to weigh our hand luggage and pay 60 eur for excess luggage due to 2 Rigas Balzams bottles that we bought at the duty free! They also changed our seats randomly. As much as i would like to support the local industry of my home region, I am leaving a negative review because the whole experience was a big nuisance and could have been avoided (e.g. bigger airlines dont enforce such strict hand luggage policies). Will try to avoid in the future.

### "avoid this airline"
We checked our luggage at Riga Airport on August 2, 2019, and all was in order. When we picked our luggage up at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam it looked like it had been caught in a wedge, as the entire right side was caved in and the handle was completely snapped in half. We immediately filed a report with the airline representative at baggage claim and subsequently filed a claim directly with AirBaltic and waited for a response. On August 7, 2019 we received an email from a customer service rep from the airline, instructing us to take the damaged luggage to one of their authorized repair shops to have it looked at and evaluated for reimbursement or repair. Problem is, all the authorized shops are located in those cities that airBaltic services, which does not include the United States, where we live. I informed them of that fact on August 10 and have not heard anything back from her. After a lot of searching I was able to find airBaltic's U.S. website and forwarded all correspondence to them on August 19, 2019, with a request to contact me. As of today, August 26th, I have not heard anything from them. Given the lack of service on the part of airBaltic, I urge anyone considering using this airline to find another carrier and avoid this airline like the plague.

### "I will never book them again"
Zurich to Riga. I booked the flight just 15 hours before departure. I got the confirmation and could Check-in online. The next morning i arrived at the airport and they told me that the flight has been cancelled. No E-Mail or no SMS they sent me. The next available flight is 9 hours later. After asking for compensation, they give me a voucher of 12 CHF and I should send an email. No support from ground-staff or helpline. Flight at night was ok. But Not even water, they provide. I will never book them again.

### "cabin crew were very kind"
Riga to Athens. This was a night flight. The cabin crew were very kind. We had ordered food which was really good. A bad things was that the cabin crew turned off the cabin light in the middle of the flight. The seats are very comfortable. The little screens that show flight information are very nice.

### "staff were friendly"
Flew from Oslo to London via Riga, my experiences with both flights were great, staff were friendly and spoke good English, as well as Russian, German and of course, Latvian. I recommend flying with this airline.

### "were told is too late"
St Petersburg to Rome via Riga. We just came back recently from long overseas holiday we were longing for years and years. Only one disaster, a huge one! All flights for our holiday were pre-arranged and paid in full to Jetabroad on 8th of June 2018. In St Petersburg, on 1st of July 2019 at 10.00 am we were ready to take AirBaltic to Rome, Italy. We were at airport at 8.00 am. The queue was huge; still we have managed to hand over our suitcases and paid tax at 9.13 Am. The security checks after that were unusually long; I never see in my life anything like that! We were in queues constantly, and when we reached the point to board but were told is too late and told we have to buy new tickets to Rome! In process of buying new tickets to Rome I was told to ask for refund for luggage tax paid previously. But, at the desk they told me: “You can ask for tax refund the latest 30 minutes before departure of particular flight!” Even, now, I am confused. Doesn’t make sense to me at all. So, I didn’t get any money back and I have to pay for the second time luggage tax for the same luggage.

### "A truly awful experience"
Riga to Reykjavik. A truly awful experience. We traveled from United States to London and then took airBaltic from London to Riga. No problems. Baggage was accepted. On the return flight from Riga to Iceland, we were required to pay 120 euros because our carry on bags were 1kg over the weight limit. Yes 1 kg. We told the attendant that it was the same luggage and weight on the way over and we didn't have a penalty. She demanded payment in a very loud and militant voice that we must pay 120 euros. She was awful. Militant is the only word I could use to describe her very rude behavior. Take a different airline is my advice.

### "forced us to weigh our cabin luggage"
We were flying from Riga to Vilnius. The ground staff was rude and forced us to weigh our cabin luggage again which had been approved by the origin airport. They said that the luggage was 11 kg and wanted us to pay 60 eur or throw away our personal items due to ‘excess’ weight. When we finally left the place and we looked back, both ground staff women were laughing. Even on the aircraft they are rude and impolite. Their English is very poor. Never fly again with this shameful airline

### "not possible to select a free seat"
Tallinn to Zurich via Riga. A bunch of thieves. I booked a flight and when I had to check in online it was not possible to select a free seat. I had to pay additional. Its like when you book with these guys you dont get a seat with the regular ticket. At least that makes then unique. Never seen anything like it. Not even with any low cost carrier.

### "last flight delayed for 14 hours"
Not Verified |  Tbilisi to Oslo via Riga. Horrible airline! Don’t buy any ticket. I have bought 4 flights from airBaltic and all were delayed. My last flight delayed for 14 hours. I bought this flight for 450 euro. Not cheap one. No attention, no accuracy, no respect.

### "also weigh your tax free bag"
Not Verified |  I flew with Air Baltic from Riga to Vilnius and got an absolutely ridiculous fine of EUR 60 for 1 kg hand luggage overweight and the rudest service ever! Please be aware that they also weigh your tax free bag which does not make any sense! I will never cfly with them again.

### "Horrible airline"
❎ Not Verified | Horrible airline! Flew with bag from Frankfort to Rīgā. Forced to check the Same bag on the return flight. Will never fly with this airline again. It is run by a bunch of kids.

### "My Horrific Experience"
Helsinki to Prague via Riga. My Horrific Experience With Air Baltic On 26 June, I, my wife and my 4-year old son were to take an Air Baltic flight from Helsinki to Prague via Riga. The stopover in Riga was to be for about 30 minutes for changing flights. The Helsinki-Riga flight started late by about 15-20 minutes, which meant that the transit time was reduced to 15 minutes. To their credit, the Air Baltic crew at Helsinki and on board told us that the Riga-Prague plane will wait for us. Halfway through the Helsinki-Riga flight, the crew announced that the Riga-Prague plane was to take off from Gate C5 at Riga airport. The flight landed at Riga airport around 5:45 pm. While quickly moving out, we double checked with the air hostess that our Prague flight was to depart from Gate C5, and she confirmed the same. The moment we reached the airport, we scrambled to get to Gate C5 which was nowhere near. After running and panting for about 10-15 minutes with a 4-year old kid, we finally reached Gate C5. However, it was closed and there was no Air Baltic staff there. We thought we must have missed the flight. We then thought of finding the Air Baltic customer care and inquire about the next steps. Just then, I saw that the flight information screen flashed the gate for our Prague flight B6. Shocked, we scrambled again and ran almost a kilometre to reach B6, where an Air Baltic attendant was about to close the gate. Fortunately, we managed to catch the flight at the last minute. We couldn't help thinking how insensitive it was for the airline to run with so much miscommunication with its passengers. The huge inconvenience we faced could have simply been avoided had we been told the right gate on board. For some weird reason, Baltic Airline only allows 20 kg check-in luggage per person, whereas the majority of other airlines in Europe provide a 23 kg limit. Now we had purchased three full tickets, which entitled us to 60 kg in total. We had two check-in pieces of luggage, each weighing slightly over 20 kg, but cumulatively weighing much less than 60 kg. The airline said we will have to pay an additional luggage fee of 50 euros per bag since they were overweight per "per bag" limit. Now I don't know if other airlines to follow the same policy, but it seems purely silly because by packing a little more in two bags, we were saving for the airline the space for one full bag. The plane would have carried 45-46 kgs instead of 60 kgs which we were allowed - so I don't understand what purpose does "per bag" policy serve. In any case, this added to our overall terrible experience with Air Baltic.

### "disgrace of a company"
Riga to Zurich. I had a carry on luggage of 8kg and bought 3kg of duty free goods at Riga airport. They weighed everything combined and had to take away my luggage and charge me 60 euros as the weight exceeded 8kg. There is no free water served on these flights. A disgrace of a company, to be avoided at all cost!

### "Better use Ryanair or Wizz Air"
Riga to Düsseldorf. Got charged 60€ extra because my backpack was a bit too heavy for hand luggage! So I "had to check it in as a normal bag, it costs 60€, no debate! I will try to prevent flying with airBaltic in the future! Better use Ryanair or Wizz Air, they don't try to charge you 60€ extra for backpack that is a 'bit too heavy'!

### "worst service ever"
Riga to Bordeaux. Terrible airline, worst service ever, humiliating experience! Don't recommend anyone this airline, but especially if you are musician. Stay away from them.

### "disappointed about both flights"
I am very disappointed about both flights - from Riga to Frankfurt and return. On both flights they changed my 5 years old daughter's seats, so we needed to wait when they change our seets, but we still could not sit all family of three together (on both flights!). And on return flight they took away my bag from cabin because there was not any free bag space on plane. So now I am sitting with some stranger next to me who is not my husband and I don't have my bag with me. That's good that some nessesery items I have in my daughters bag. I feel really angry and disappointed! And plane is still not going, there is still delay.

### "Water should be minimum"
This flight was a part of ticket sold by KLM and it was operating from Amsterdam to Tallin by airBaltic. Ground staff was very friendly and helpful. I've got a good place in the plane and we take off on time. However service on board was only paid which is unacceptable and low-cost airline. In my opinion airline shouldn't refuse you at least glass of water to avoid dehydrate. Water should be minimum. However me and my luggage got on place on time, so the goal has been achieved.

### "upset with the attitude"
Moscow to Paris via Riga. I am very upset with the attitude of the airline. I missed my flight because of a huge queue at the control. The woman who was supposed to help passengers was just standing there announcing that “gate closes in 4 min”. When i approached her to help me skip the line she was rude and said that it is not her job and continued announcing that the gate closes in 2 min. Finally I came to the gate when it was already closed. The next flight I was offered is leaving in 10 hours. I didn’t even get a hotel and have to stay for 10 hours in the airport with two 5 eur vouchers for meal

### "must do check in online"
Barcelona to Moscow via Riga. Barcelona-Riga I was charged 30EUR extra to do check-in. Apparently, I must do check in online with extra charge of 8EUR. In the airport they did not accept to do 2 payments of 15EUR with my card neither, they sent me to pay by cash and they did not care that I did not have cash with me. It was my first time with this company, never again!

### "cabin service extremely poor"
Gatwick to Riga. Comfortable plane and excellent take off and landing. But, cabin service was extremely poor - attendants simply failed to offer any food or beverage. Could not understand announcements in English. And airbaltic is the first airline I’ve ever known not to offer free water to customers. Absolutely shocking.

### "commend this company"
I flew from Zurich to Riga with an  A220, the flight was slightly delayed due to other aircraft. The airplane was clean and the cabin staff very helpful and friendly, unfortunately no internet access on the flight. I commend this company, which is developing.

### "efficiency and punctuality"
A 50-minute flight from Riga to Tallinn on a Dash 8 bombardier, plane in excellent condition as well as the comfort of the seats. The staff during the flight was a bit absent, moreover I recommend this company for its efficiency and punctuality.

### "it wasn't that bad"
St. Petersburg to Prague via Riga, it wasn't that bad after all. No cabin baggage weighing or measuring as mentioned in some reviews, there was nice staff greeting us on board and the plane was clean. IFE consisted only from the in-flight magazine, but it was pretty thick, enough reading for two hours flight. No food, snacks or water during the flight, but you know that before taking the flight as the company's strategy is going low-cost.

### "Soviet heritage customer service"
Gatwick to Vilnius via Riga. Terrible customer service. We was denied our flight to Riga from Vilnius due to delay of their inbound flight from Gatwick. It was explained that we missed our last flight and should go to collect luggage and go to ticket office for travel re-arrangement. Lady in reception told that air Baltic offer for us can offer only ground transportation to Vilnius airport. When one gentleman asked for flight next day it was told that there is no chances to stay overnight ("no available hotels in Riga that night") and that all flights from Riga to Vilnius on next day are fully booked. Then after doubts how it can be that all flights and hotels are overbooked in Riga she told that probably the is 1 seat, then "maybe 3 seats" in morning flight, but hotel for sure she cannot book, and if we wish we can do it on our own money and then apply to refund of 70 EUR. When we started negotiate ground transfer, story continue very interesting way - it was told that cab cannot bring us to hotel/home address, only to drop off in Vilnius airport. After emotional complains why we need to go by cab to Vilnius airport and then back to city by taxi at 5AM , she firstly told that it is because our destination is Vilnius airport, and we will be delivered right here (even if it is after 4 hour drive and no taxi in Vilnius airport at that time). Then after 5 min of emotional discussion she once again changed her mind and told that OK, we may take taxi in Vilnius airport and then to submit receipt to refund. When we told that this is stupid, that we need to cross all city and then go back, she told that ok ok you may ask transfer driver to drop off in your destinations only if this is on way to airport. No consent was given to sign for us, just she gave voucher to driver, and that's it. Now I have problem with insurance company. I not even mention kindness words used like "sorry for inconvenience", "I will do my best" or any provision of refreshments, etc. When we finally asked surname (name was on card) of receptionist she told that this info she is not obliged to provide.So, all long story short - airBaltic represented as it’s best Soviet heritage of customer service with "Service provider always right" and "No, we can't" attitude. If you want this experience, you may try to travel with this airline. For me enough is enough! I chose airBaltic to London via Riga instead direct flights Vilnius-London with WIZZ and Ryanair because I was expecting more intelligent and kind attitude, and paid for it extra 100 EUR per ticket. How naive I was!

### "the worst cabin service"
Larnaca to Copenhagen via Riga. Airbaltic has the worst cabin service i have ever experienced. Both when flying to Larnaca from Copenhagen via Riga, and home trip, there were small delays, which meant we literally ran to gate to make the flight. And even though both flights are operated by air Baltic instead of a quick apology and a smile they bark orders at you, to hurry and are super unfriendly. Only with airbaltic I have experienced that people are having some difficulty with fitting the cabin luggage into the overhead compartment, and the cabin crew are just standing and eyeballing instead of helping. I could go on. But all in all airbaltic is just disastrous airline, and to make matters worse airport in Riga has also lots of issues. So are you flying with airbaltic through Riga, you are almost guaranteed a disappointment.

### "Avoid this airline if possible."
Stockholm to Tallinn via Riga. I have travelled three times with this airline on the Tallinn-Riga-Stockholm route. All three times the flight from Tallinn to Riga has been delayed, causing me to miss my flight from Riga to Stockholm. Air Baltic put me on a later flight, but the wait is usually more than 3 hours. When I write to the airline asking for compensation, they always say no. This is in violation of the European Union's Flight Compensation Regulation 261/2004. So I write to the Consumer Agency in Latvia, they take my case and Air Baltic, reluctantly, pays me compensation. This is not a serious airline. Customer service is dismal; and the airline staff is rude and unfriendly. Avoid this airline if possible.

### "Every time is a delay"
Berlin to Riga. Every time I have to flY with Air Baltic is a delay - information is rubbish and in one occasion even after 4 hours delay they insist in not pay even for a bottle of water. One of the worse airlines I have ever had to deal with. If you can avoid please do so.

### "Do not recommend it"
Berlin to Tallinn. Customer service level is unacceptable. Once the airline experiences delays, no apology, explanation given until later on. During the delay (delay that results overnight), no water etc. is given to passengers nor to pets that airline charges a fee for! Refused claim despite the EU regulations. Email is not answered, 10 working days has passed as per their rule. Do not recommend it neither to people nor passengers travelling with animals especially! This is one of the many incidents I have experienced with Air Baltic, therefore, it had to be shared because enough is enough.

### "9 hrs on a overcrowded airport"
Baku to Amsterdam via Riga with airBaltic. The flights were supposedly 6 hrs total, it was 17 hrs: no explanation, rude staff at transfer Riga, they shoved me off with 2 vouchers for 2 coffee. I waited 9 hrs on a overcrowded airport. No lounge seat. During first flight they were assuring me the connecting flight would wait: not so. They did not even offer water or some food as consolation. Handed in my claim : according to EU regulation 261/2004 AirBaltic is accountable and should pay for my loss of time (i missed out on a meeting on top of it) No response whatsoever. so now I have to hand in my claim to get this case settled.

### "don’t recommend to fly them"
❌ Not Verified |  First time flying with with Air Baltic to Riga from Berlin-Tegel. Received several changes of flight schedules one week before the flight. Tried to ask by calling their customer services related to flight changes but no good solution offered. Nevertheless I accept the flight changes as they are the only one serving the direct route from Berlin-Tegel. They used aircraft CS3000 for both flights and the cabin is clean enough. The seat has large space. The cabin crew was OK und did their duties well. My return flight was cancelled. The Air Baltic Service Management did not provide any clear information related to the delay, compensation and next available flights. I had to change to several lockets to be able to rebook my return flight to Berlin and to get a room at hotel. They also reject the compensation under the EU regulation which is still applicable for the delay of my return flight to Berlin. In my opinion, I don’t recommend to fly with them as its customer service we’re so awful and did not help the passengers much.

### "a total disgrace"
Helsinki to Zurich via Riga. The worse flight (including check-in counter) experience I have ever had in my life. AirBaltic has proven by far that they will do anything to take money from you laughing at your face. The staff at Helsinki is absolutely terrible, the cabin luggage policy is a bad joke that should be prohibited (max 8 Kgs). Airbaltic pushed it so far that they deserve an airline category just for them “worse-cost”. Airbaltic and the whole experience is a total disgrace for the entire airline industry.

### "painfully slow customer service"
Flew Riga to Kiev. Apart from painfully slow customer service on-board, another deceptive and annoying thing is requirement to pay for adjacent seat allocation within the same booking. I know this tactic has been previously employed by some low costers but it was then pulled due to negative publicity and complaints from customers. Hopefully the same will ultimately happen with airBaltic.

### "Poor customer service"
Paris to Riga return last June. Air Baltic lost our 9 year old daughter's luggage, which happens from time to time. That is understandable. We arrived in Riga on a Thursday for a six day trip. It took them until Monday night to get our daughter's bag to us in Old Riga, just a few miles from the airport. She was without shoes or a coat and we put off making purchases, knowing the luggage would be delivered quickly. As each day passed, we were given vague answers and handed off to other people. We ended up having to purchase clothing and toiletries for her, and Air Baltic refused to refund us for the bulk of the purchases, saying they would pay only 40 EUR. I was not upset that they lost our luggage. I am very upset, however that they would not resolve our problem until two days before we were to fly home, then they would not reimburse us for necessary items, and here is is mid March (this happened last July) and we still have not been paid the 40 EUR that they promised. They are treating us like we did something wrong, when we were just innocent customers. I will never  do business with them again, even though the flights were fine and fairly priced. Poor customer service continues to haunt us 8 months after they lost our daughter's suitcase.

### "never fly airBaltic again"
Helsinki to Hamburg via Riga. Small propeller aircraft, not much space inside. Very impolite staff at Helsinki, checked the hand luggage at the gate very exactly - €60 if it‘s even one more kg than allowed. Fee for choosing a seat even at online checkin. Bought a croissant at €5 - very very small and dry. It seems that they just want to sell as much extras as they can, got several emails with advertisings for that before my flight. And the the ticket wasn’t even cheap. Will definitely never fly airBaltic again.

### "Ridiculous cabin baggage rules"
Helsinki to Riga. Ridiculous cabin baggage rules. 8kg limit for carry-on case, handbag and duty free shopping. Even 1kg over will incur an incredible fee of 60 euros. Clearly something to make more money. Will always go for other options in the future, even if 40-60 euros more, just out of principle. An experience like this is enough to put me off for life.

### "luggage-policy is creating a mess"
Riga to Frankfurt. Web check-in smooth, guaranteed seats together at an additional 9.99 EUR p.p. Unfriendly staff at gate in Riga, picking out guests with probably "oversized" hand-luggage, overall their luggage-policy is creating a mess on the ground as well as in the aisles. New Bombardier CS300-aircraft impressive at first sight: attractive mood-lighting, really good seat-pitch, smallish monitors overhead each row featuring airshow only, but still better than nothing, and the first good sound-system I ever noticed in an aircraft for public announcements/lounge music. Large overhead-bins for the huge amounts of hand-luggage on a fully-booked flight like this. Contrary to inbound flight a few days before unfriendly crew. All drinks/food at additional, relatively high costs. The seats are hard as solid wood, headrest included. However the real letdown of this newly designed aircraft are the noise level and vibrations. Sitting above the wings feels like riding a rocket throughout the entire flight: whereas models like the A320 or B738 provide a smooth ride soon after takeoff, the CS300 gives you quite a noise and constant vibrations from the massive engines, which seem to be intensified by the hard seats. Weather conditions were absolutely okay, but the flight felt like flying through clouds all the time - not relaxing at all. So better avoid rows 14 to at least 22, the back of the aircraft was much quieter. Upon arrival in Frankfurt no sufficient amount of buses due to full load of pax and their hand-luggage. Last bus-load had to wait on the tarmac while aircraft was already being cleaned.

### "does not care about customer"
Tbilisi to Copenhagen via Riga. This is the worst experience and worst airline. Staff are rude, even staff at Riga airport. Flight got delayed in Tbilisi and the flight attendant lied that the connecting flight from Riga to Copenhagen will wait for us, but it turned out to be that it took off  before we land in Riga. They compensated us with a lousy 3 euro voucher for a 5 hour delay. Almost 150 people aboard were delayed too for different destination. Air Baltic does not care about customer service. When I told them this is the last time I am flying with them, they replied: your choice!.

### "I do not recommend this airline"
Geneva to Vilnius via Riga. This is worst than a low cost company! First, they refuse to serve you a glass of water freely as they are selling bottle of water on their menu. They do not serve anything free (I know it has changed now and some of them do not serve snacks etc, but at least water!). It would ok if it was as cheap as a low coast but this is not the case! I have a suitcase of 23x55x40 which normally fits airlines except Air Baltic - so I had to pay 60€ to check in my hand luggage. I do not recommend this airline at all.

### "typical semi lowcost airline"
Riga to Budapest. A typical semi lowcost airline. The main hub (Riga Airport) is clean and nice, the ground service of the airline is nothing special. The legroom is amazing compared to other lowcost airlines and the cabin is very clean. Meals and drinks are available on purchase, the cabin crew served meals and beverages two times during our flight (you can preorder your meals too, the variety of meals is wide). The cabin crew was very moody, the couldn't make even a smile. Our flight was 2 hours 10 minutes long: this is the time what is unbearable on a turboprop aircraft. You cannot sleep and relax because of the noise.

### "do not recommend them at all"
For 3 years I have been flying with airBaltic and this is the first time I have seen them make money on luggage allowances. They stopped lots of people to check if the hand luggage fit their requirements. Usually mine is ok. This time they asked me for a 60e extra. The price is already expensive, how can they pretend to be low cost and have lots of hidden extras. I do not recommend them at all. The only point in travelling with them is that they have the monopoly unfortunately.

### "very disappointed by the airline"
Kiev to Tallinn via Riga. I am very disappointed by the airline. I had layover 40 minutes in Riga where I have to pass passport and security control. The plane from Kiev landed 20 minutes later. I was expecting the airline worker to met us near the gate, but there was nobody. On the passport control, there was a long queue. On the security check, there was an even bigger queue. However, only one line worked. Moreover, all people in the queue also were late, so I was not able to fast forward. We have managed to arrive at the gate 3 minutes prior the departure time and board the plane. The plane was Boeing 737-300 which is an old garbage. The brakes produced terrible noise. The interior was old. The tickets are expensive, while the service is worse then low-cost airlines.

### "airBaltic put a bitter taste in my mouth"
Tallinn to Amsterdam. airBaltic appear to be making extra money on luggage allowance. I flew from Amsterdam to Tallinn on 23/10/17 with my family and there was not an issue with our hand luggage. We did notice the cabin crew seemed determined to annoy as many people as possible by opening the luggage racks and moving peoples luggage that seemed okay to me and the rest of the passengers. We returned to Tallinn airport to come home on 27/10/17 and suddenly our bags were now too large and 3 out of 4 we had to pay 60 euros to board. There were 2 queues and on the right hand side the lady let everybody through but in the left hand lane there were two ladies, one was either a new starter or supervisor. The policy appeared to be anybody with an English or American accent was stopped and baggage checked. We again witnessed the cabin crew having fun with peoples luggage. We had a wonderful break in Tallin but airBaltic have put a bitter taste in my mouth and put me off booking again in this region.

### "we lost a full day in Stockholm"
Flew airBaltic from Geneva to Stockholm via Riga. Service onboard was ok. Fresh cabin on a 737 and leg space was not too bad because of the new seats. The problems started when reaching Riga 10 minutes delayed. Another 10 minute delay followed since there were no ground crew at the gate. Connection time to Stockholm was 30 minutes so we didn't reach the flight. Ground crew were in general not helpful and were rude at the gate, transfer desk and information desk. We got new tickets on another airline several hours later. We had to wait outside the security control since check-in didn't open until 2 hours before departure. They thought they had lost our luggage, which they had no clue how to locate. We found it in the end after talking to all the employees we could find, for some reason it was placed in the lost and found room. If it weren't for us pushing them to find it we would not have gotten it that day. Basically we lost a full day in Stockholm and, and ended up spending it at an airport restaurant outside the security area. If you're flying airBaltic make sure they don't try to put you on a 30 min connection.

### "I was very satisfied"
Riga to Amsterdam. I flew as a so called premium economy passenger. However, this does not entail a separate cabin. It merely bundles into one fare all those little bits like baggage, seat selection etc that you have to pay for separately if you select a low cost fare. Further, at Riga airport you get a special check-in counter and priority security screening, which makes those processes very streamlined. The aircraft itself was clean. There was no IFE. On this flight, I didn't order or buy any food. I found the cabin crew polite and efficient. Take off, landing and baggage retrieval were all efficiently handled. For this distance, I was very satisfied with the airBaltic experience.

### "Absolutely not helpful"
Gatwick to St Petersburg via Riga. Unreasonable rip off! The strategy is simple. Hand luggage is max 8 kilos. Cameras shall be in, can't be on you. So if you are 3 kg over, they insist you repack to check in bag your extra weight. Suddenly your 20 kg bag is 23 kg. and it becomes a heavy bag. What is normally heavy in other airlines is 30 kg and above. Heavy bag costs 43£ extra (London to Riga . Paying by kilos is not an option. Provided I already paid for premier is absolutely nasty price. On top of it customer service is really bad. I asked if I can pay but dont repack as my all hand luggage is photo cameras, which are retro and fragile. No way supervisor allowed me to do that. Absolutely not helpful. With all the amounts combined, can fly much better airline with this money. Fragile" sticker was a piece of the sticker that is normally used to check the bag and print barcode. They just took and empty one, took a normal school pen, not even anything that writes thick, and wrote "fragile". Hoping that would be noticed and taken into account is delusional.

### "harassed at the gate"
Minsk to Helsinki via Riga. The flight went otherwise well, but I wanted to point out unnecessary and behaviour of a airBaltic gate staff at Riga airport. I was told at the gate to put my bag in the rack to test my bag size. I had to gently push it in because of the handles. However, this was not enough for the airBaltic employee. He repeated three times, that the bag needs to go "easy in, easy out". I felt I was harassed at the gate, and wasn't allowed to take the bag to the cabin (checking in the bag was free). The point is the bag needs to fit to the cabin compartment, as it does. If it fits the rack and takes a few millimetres of more space perhaps, I felt that it wasn't enough for this arrogant behaviour and getting a customer upset. I think this experience is very telling about the company's culture, values and attitude towards its customers.

### "service goes down over time"
Brussels to Riga. Their service goes down over time. On my last trip to Riga they have lost my luggage again, even though their rep has confirmed the luggage has been tracked OK in Brussels. Upon the arrival company’s agent in Riga did not have a clue where my bags were. Multiple calls to baggage claim department have helped to receive my luggage after four days. However, one of them was ripped out, no plastic wrap. I have dropped off at their head office in the airport, but Customer Service rep has refused to meet in person to explain the situation.

### "said they could do nothing"
Poor Service. We had flight from Tbilisi to Paris via Riga with a connection timer of 40mins. Airplane arrived on time, but we were waiting about 15 minutes for the loading stairs, we also wasted time in the queue in passport control, we arrived at the gate and the gate was close. Airplane departed after 20 minutes after we showed up. airBaltic said they could do nothing. There was so many people with the same case. Nobody was listening to us and was offering us to buy new tickets from Riga to Paris for 300 EUR, without baggage. They even did not offered us any kind of discount for new ticket, finally we bought new tickets from Finnair. Try to save your nerves and money and not try to buy tickets from AirBaltic.

### "fly with some other company"
Hamburg to Riga. I recently had flight from Newark to Riga with connection in Hamburg. Arrived at 6:50AM and my flight was scheduled for 8:50AM, so I had almost 2 hours waited at the gate. I had all documents, did check in Newark, only needed to pick up boarding pass at the gate when someone show up! Couldn't print boarding pass in Newark because United and Air Baltic have no agreement, so they only can confirm your check-in, but boarding pass must be picked up at the gate! When lady show up at 8:15 AM she said I'm not registered - how did I get to Hamburg then? After she said I supposed to get there earlier to get my boarding pass. Earlier? I was there for over an hours and she got there 4 min ago! Then she said flight is overbooked and someone is actually seating on my seat! No apologies and no alternative options. I had to buy tickets with LOT to get to my final destination! I would give them 0 star and never fly with them! When I claimed Air Baltic, they said I did not show up for my flight. In Riga I found out it is normal practice for Air Baltic. Please, save your nerves and money and fly with some other company.

### "should be avoided"
Tallinn to Copenhagen via Riga. Airbaltic should be avoided. I've been travelling with airbaltic for the last 8 years without any problems and was a loyal customer but after they started scamming people in the transit area of their home airport in Riga I could not stand but write this review. They allow you to bring 1 bag with you on board at your departure, but then charge you 60 EUR for it at the gate for your next transit flight in Riga. They even hired special staff to do that - 2 ladies checking everyone in the queue to the gate looking for appropriate victim and then telling them to pay. Several people got charged together with me on my last flight. It's pure scam as people had they luggage checked during first flight to Riga, but have no other option but pay 60 EUR at the gate.

### "Perfect short flights"
Amsterdam to Vilnius return. These flights were on Boeing 737's with good leg-room and were on time, with friendly cabin crew. Food and drink were available for purchase, and airBaltic accepts cash (euros) so passengers were served more expeditiously (excellent Latvian beer on offer, by the way). Perfect short flights, perfectly done.

### "impressed with cabin interior."
We flew to Riga from Gatwick for a family holiday in June, and used Airbaltic, We were over an hour late due to technical problems with the aircraft at Riga and a change of aircraft was needed. However we were further delayed by the so called ground handling company at Gatwick. This company delayed the already delayed aircraft by not having gate staff on duty at the gate. We left Gatwick nearly two hours late, however we arrived in Riga 45 minutes late, and were able to make our train with about 5 minutes to spare. The aircraft was clean and comfortable. The cabin service was slick and both the cockpit and cabin crew were apologetic for the delay and were able to make up time on the flight to Riga. The prices onboard are reasonable and the range of snacks and drinks very good quality. The return flight was on one of the new CS300 aircraft and I was very impressed with the cabin interior. The seats are in a 2-3 formation and very comfortable. We sat in 7a/c and we were able to use the tray table when the person in front reclined their seat. The cabin has mood lighting and a inhouse monitor about the size of an IPhone in the seat lighting panel. The overhead lockers of a size that would hold 3 standard size cabin bags with ease. Again the cabin service was slick and the crew were happy to upsell extra drinks and food when passing though the cabin. The only negative side to the flight was been held at Riga for 45 minutes due to ATC congestion in the London Area. Both the cabin and cockpit announcements were clear and informative. My only negative comment is the lack of on-board Wi-Fi connection but I did mention this when leaving and was told it is something the airline is looking into has these aircraft the equipment on board but they have not yet switched it on.

### "Never again flying Air Baltic"
Amsterdam to Vilnius. One of the worst customer service experiences ever. While boarding my flight from Amsterdam to Vilnius I have informed flight attendant that I am feeling unwell and sked  her to look for some medicine to relieve my pain - this 30 seconds conversation was the first and last time I saw the girl. After the plane took off neither herself not her colleagues checked up on me and hasn't offered any medicine. Eventually, it became better but this shouldn't have been ignored. People who travel are far away from home with nobody to turn to so especially in such situations you should be providing some attention and help. There is definitely something wrong with this airline. Never again flying Air Baltic.

### "Worst customer service ever"
Rijeka to Tallin via Riga. Worst customer service ever. The flight was delayed 5.5 hours and we were never told - not by email or text, not when we checked in, and not by any personnel. In fact, us grumbling passengers sat at the gate for over an hour past our boarding time before any of us were able to find someone who told us about the long delay. Instead of leaving at 7pm, it was now departing at 1am the next day. Of course I missed my connection and had to eat the cost of the hotel I had reserved on the other end. The airline's compensation? A sandwich and bottle of water. And when 4 hours went by and I asked for another water, I was made to pay for it. I would have gladly drank out of a drinking fountain, but there was none - I was told to get it out of the bathroom faucet.

### "expensive and offers no service"
Never use airBaltic. It is very expensive and offers no service. The only thing they are interested in is to force you to pay them as much money as you only can for some absolutely natural things. My case: I travelled from Hamburg to Moscow via Riga for €338 economy with my cabin baggage. It was 8,3kg and I didn't buy any extra luggage. Nobody told me on my trip to Moscow that my bag is too heavy or oversized. On my way back they started to pretend that the bag is heavier than allowed 8kg (300 grams) and is too big. When I told them, that they must have told me this on my way to the destination, not on my way back they just ignored my remark. I politely asked them to let me take the bag with me to the cabin, as I was short on time to wait for the bag in Hamburg. In a very impertinent manner they refused me. I asked them to let me pay, for the bag but still take it with me to the cabin. They just didn't allow me that although in the first two segments of flight it was no problem. In the end I paid 400€ for economy from Hamburg to Moscow and back with no meal, one luggage and no service.

### "disadvantage is ancient aircraft"
Vilnius to Munich with airBaltic on Boeing 737-500. Acceptable service for reasonable price (135 euro RT). Looks like a fair low-cost airline and airBaltic flies to main airports instead of secondary (MUC instead of FMM etc.). Polite and competent crew, quick and efficient online booking and check-in. The main disadvantage is ancient aircraft (Boeing 737-500 was 25 years old and looked very tired).

### "cramped and not comfortable"
airBaltic seats are small, there's no reasonable legroom and two really big guys were snoring and almost laying over me. I was cramped and not comfortable. At least, the flight was short. The price for round trip from Tallinn to Riga was over 300 euros, which is really expensive - it was the cheapest class and cheapest everything.

### "only had one bad flight"
Having flown with AirBaltic over the past 10 years, and only had one bad flight on the Gatwick to Riga route. This return flight was well above the high standard of the service that the airline operates, however they are let down by the Ground Handling agents at LGW (Gatwick Ground Handling). The boarding of the flight was delayed by 30 minutes due to ground staff  leaving a set of doors open on the next gate (33) and a BA 777 been parked on that stand. Hence passengers arriving disembarked via the walk way across gate 32. Which according to the cabin crew is a daily occurrence since the terminal changes at Gatwick, hence we departed 30 minutes late but were able to make up 25 minutes due to the tail wind. Pre ordered meal was good value for money and tasty. The cabin service was slick. The announcements from the cockpit and cabin were clear and informative. The prices onboard were high street prices and good value. The outbound trip was on a half empty plane and the return the plane again was only about 75% full. The return flight I was offered an upgrade at the airport on check in the day before and the service at the Customer Service Desk was excellent. This is the first time I have flown Airbaltic in Business class and was surprised at the level of service offered. Again the food was tasty. Arrival at both airports the formalities were fast and quick I took 15 minutes at Riga and 20 minutes at Gatwick. Due to the problems with the ground service at Gatwick on the outbound flight, I have adjusted the score of Airport Service. However I am due to fly again with the airline on the same route in June and today have received an email telling me that the flight time have been adjusted by 30 minutes.

### "CS300 is great aircraft"
I flew airBaltic on 2th March from Riga to Barcelona and on 5th return. Tried their pre-ordered meal for the first time and it was good. CS300 is great aircraft, was happy to try it. Silent, a lot of sunlight inside because of big windows, a lot of leg space. Return flight was on old Boeing which is ok but it is less comfortable and has little legroom and hand luggage space is too small which is not a problem on CS300. I could recommend flying them but suggest to have at least 3 hours between flights if you use Riga as a transfer hub.

### "CS300 is a very good aircraft"
I flew airBaltic from London Gatwick to Riga on the new Bombardier CS300 and from Riga to Amsterdam on an old Boeing 737-300. The CS300 is a very good aircraft, bright, roomier with wide seats in a 2x3 configuration. The Boeing 737-300 is still okay, but shows its age, seats very hard. We left on both flights over an hour late due to weather, crews fine.

### "luggage lost for an entire week"
Tel Aviv to Stockholm via Riga. I tried to check in on my phone and the app did not allow me. The only way was buying lunch in order to move on with the check in process. I decided to get to the counter and the person charged me US$ 35 euros only for checking me in (even though their app had problems to check in). They charged me in total US$100 for checking in and checking my luggage. The service was terrible, especially from the person at the counter. In addition to all that, my luggage did not arrive to the final destination and was lost for an entire week. Every time I called the airline, they were charging me per minute even though they were the ones who lost my suitcase.

### airBaltic customer review
Gatwick to Riga. I have been flying many years with this airline. Since it offers many connections, obviously there are not many choices, however when possible I try to choose any other airline and if I'm not in rush, I better pick connecting flights than flying direct with airbaltic. I hate this airline because of bad support I have received before for changing flights. I believe this sits in my head for many years and there is nothing really to love this airline. Primarily to fly with AirBaltic, the tickets are quiet expensive and the service is non existent. You are basically flying EasyJet at cost of Lufthansa or Turkish Airlines. EasyJet service is much better. Normally flights are on time.

### "excellent service"
Helsinki-Riga-Helsinki. Excellent service. Clean cabins. Preordered meal was vanished, but the FA gave me another meal. Comparing the airline which fly the same route, airBaltic is definitely the winner. Clear announcements from the cockpit also surprisingly in Finnish. Looking forward to book another flight.

### "flights were great"
Berlin Tegel to Riga. The flights were great, the cabin staff on both legs seemed to take pride in their work. I ordered a meal on both legs and the meals seemed to be good value for money and tasty. The cabins were clean and looked fresh. The seats were comfortable with plenty of leg room. The only minor point is no internet and I know some airlines are now offering this on certain routes. The announcements both from the cockpit and cabin were clear and easy to be understood. On the first flight it was a Dash 800 used for the flight and this was quieter than I expected and has been a while since I have flown a turbo prop aircraft. Also on arrival at Riga we were treated to a display by the Airport Fire Service has the flight was the Captains last flight before retiring from flying. The return flight was on a B737 and the flight left on time and arrived in Tegel 10 minutes ahead of time.

### "very stressful and "negative
Negative experience with Airbaltic Our family (two adult and two children, 4 and 1 y.o.) went through an infuriating experience with Airbaltic on our way from Riga to Munich. Five minutes prior to boarding the flight was cancelled due to a technical problem and we were told to organise alternative flights at the information desk. We were in disbelief because our flight connections were now all out. There was a massive queue in front of the information counter, moving very slowly, as everyone needed to reschedule flights. We spent a long time waiting and then we were offered the option of calling the Airbaltic helpline to reschedule flights ourselves. So we called and were told that they would get us to Munich but that we would need to book any further connections ourselves. As a result, we spent more than two hours calling backwards and forwards between Airbaltic and Qatar Airways (our connecting flight), trying to line up all the connections as soon as possible, even though we believe it was the responsibility of Airbaltic to look after us as customers. In the end we spent the whole day from early morning till evening with two young kids at the Riga airport, flew to Munich via Berlin as there were no available direct flights that day and we had to pay for accommodation out of pocket. Airbaltic refused to reimburse our accommodation costs. We finally boarded our homeward flight the following morning. Our experience with Airbaltic was ultimately very stressful and negative, they gave us the impression of a company that cares only about money not people. Why did a technical fault appear five minutes before boarding? We will refrain from flying with them in the future and we don't recommend anybody else does either.

### "wonderful after an exhausting trip"
Riga to Tallinn with airBaltic. A particularly considerate flight attendant brought a blanket to cushion the seatbelt on my belly when she noticed I'm pregnant - a very nice and caring gesture. Made me feel wonderful after an exhausting business trip.

### "customer relations are abysmal"
I was booked to fly from Riga to Tallinn on Air Baltic (BT315) at 14:25. Here’s what actually happened - I checked my bag at the airport and went to the gate, but no agent was there. After the flight was supposed to leave, there was a general announcement about a runway closure due to the emergency landing of an aircraft earlier in the morning. An airport monitor showed a new departure time of 18:00. As I waited in a long queue for an agent, the departure time for BT315 was changed again to 21:30. At 16:00, the runway was opened again and flights started to leave. My flight was still shown as departing at the delayed time of 21:30. At 19:30, the RIX airport website showed that my flight was cancelled. At 20:30, I managed to speak with an agent who got me a seat on the only flight to Tallinn that night, BT361 scheduled at 23:05. BT361 was delayed and left at 00:10, arriving in Tallinn at 00:55 on September 16. On the flight, the flight attendant was small minded enough to actually refuse me water, by insisting that all beverages need to be bought on Air Baltic. Talk about utter cheapness and disregard for the ordeal Air Baltic had put passengers through. So to sum up the situation - I got to Tallinn almost 10 hours later than scheduled. In this time, I could have driven to Tallinn and back. If I could offer some words of advice to someone considering this airline - be warned! Avoid it at all costs. If there's a problem, you'll have to do all the legwork and be tenacious in defending your rights. Customer relations are abysmal.

### "staff terribly unprofessional"
Riga to Vienna. We booked tickets couple month prior, checked in 24 hours prior and printed our passes 2 hours prior at their airport counter. All that to find out that my boyfriend and I were rudely bumped out our flight 5 min before boarding without any proper explanation. Staff was terribly unprofessional and acting unacceptably, for all requests to see manager replying they either do not not where he is either he is not accessible? There was no calling for volunteers to get bumped out and we did not get any compenstaion right away. Neither got upgraded tickets for the another flight. Even free meal was not offered, though we did not have time to eat jumping from flight to flight in order to reach our destination finally. The whole reaction of staff was like 'whatever'. I fly a lot and was bumped out before, things happened, of course - but situation was always resolved right away with maximum comfort for the customer. Alas, Air Baltic is far from such standards as possible.

### "impressed by their website"
My flight from London to Riga was delayed, and I missed the connection to Moscow (it was to be only an hour, but that was the reason, why I bought such ticket — it was to be quite fast). We were rebooked to the next flights available (and I asked to book me a seat on the later flight, because the first one was very early — they agreed), given hotel rooms, transfer from/to the airport and a meal voucher for 5 EUR, which is possible to use at airport cafes. The problem was there was no cafes at the airport, which were open at night (about 11 PM), and airBaltic didn't provide a meal (so for me this was a drawback, but it's questionable, since not everybody has meal at 11 PM), but I managed to find a McDonald's near the hotel and to buy food. The hotel was quite comfortable, located in good, quiet place, near the big supermarket (not working at night), the rooms with shower, and nice breakfast was included in the room price. There was good wi-fi  in the hotel. The next day I arrived to Moscow and sent a letter to the airBaltic customer service concerning the flight delay and asked to refund me the half of the ticket fare for being late. They replied in a week that they will provide a compensation of 400 EUR (more than the ticket price was). That was nice. Concerning the flights, the cabins were quite clean, the planes looked new. I flew in economic class, and the seats weren't wide enough, and the space for legs wasn't huge, but it was the same as I faced in economic class of other airlines. The staff was polite. I preordered a drink, and it was served to me soon after the take-off. I was impressed by their website. It allows you to preorder meals and drinks for quite reasonable prices, and the choice is good (in my opinion). The online check-in starts 7 days before the flight, and you can get your boarding pass in different formats. One should keep in mind that this is a lowcost airline, and one has to pay for meals, buggage, etc if needed) and can recommend it to anyone who considers indirect flights.

### "impressed with airBaltic"
I read a lot of negative reviews about Air Baltic and Riga Airport. On the outward journey all flights and connections were on time, but coming back yesterday the flight from Gatwick to Riga was delayed by an hour due to long lines of planes waiting to take off at Gatwick, so all those with onward flights to St Petersburg, Moscow, Tallinn and Tbilisi only had about 10 minutes connecting time left. However, the Air Baltic crew announced the gate numbers before we landed and went from seat to seat giving connecting passengers information, and once on the ground airport officials were waiting and very clearly gave everyone instructions on how to get to their gates quickly as the flights had been held. After a short wait on the plane to St Petersburg for the luggage of all the connecting passengers to arrive, we departed and only arrived in St Petersburg about half an hour late. I was impressed with Air Baltic and Riga Airport and thank all for their assistance.

### "budget airline with premium pricing"
Flew from Riga to Brussels. Overall, airBaltic is a budget airline with premium pricing. I have to fly with them, because there are no alternatives. Uncomfortable seats with very limited leg space and short headrests, squezeed as close as possible, rather overpriced and greasy food, although sometimes there are pleasant surprises. Aircraft always parks in the furthest possible slot, often buses are used and these cases the absolute minimum of them, so the buses are always overcrowded. However, both cabin and ground staff are very polite and responsive

### "service was slick and professional"
airBaltic was let down on this flight by the totally unprofessional ground handling agents at gate D2 this afternoon. The gate staff were more interested in playing with their mobile phones than doing the job they are paid to do. The inbound aircraft that was used for the flight was late. This meant the flight to London was going to be delayed. The gate staff were rude, unhelpful and let the airline, airport and Latvia down. Having been Cabin Crew myself, I know that it takes minutes to turn an aircraft around and do a crew change. The gate staff gave misinformation to flyers which in my book is a big no no. There were an American Family who were flying from Heathrow later this evening and others who wanted to let people meeting them know that the flight was going to be late but the gate staff did not care less. The answers that were given ranged from the aircraft is not here yet to the aircraft will be in London at 5pm. The aircraft crew were first class and professional both the cockpit and cabin crew apologised for the delay. The service was slick and professional. The Cabin menu is tasty and fresh. The coffee tasted like coffee rather than the lukewarm water on some airlines offer. The flight arrived 35 minutes late and was held in a holding pattern over Kent as we had missed our slot, I got the impression that the pilots did attempt to make up some of the lost time. I am looking forward to flying on the new aircraft that are entering service later this year.

### "smiled at all times"
Flew airBaltic from London Gatwick to Riga, Latvia. I have flown with the airline quite a few times and have had some bad, ok and good flights. This was one of the better ones, the cabin crew were very friendly and did not attempt any hard sell. They seem to have the pleasure in their work and smiled at all times. The announcements were clear. It was nice to hear updates from the cockpit telling us the weather and route taken. The aircraft was clean despite a 30 minute turn round at Gatwick. The food available for purchase was first class and tasty. The Salmon flat bread was to die for it actually looked fresh and could of passed for made to order. The prices for food and drink are some of the best I have seen for a while. Keep up the good work and I am looking forward to travelling on the new aircraft which should be in service later this year. Can I suggest that wifi is available on them and also please operate from London City airport? The reason for the low mark for ground service is due to the agents at Gatwick.

### "staff very polite"
Berlin Tegel-Riga-Warsaw aboard 737-300 and 500. Aircraft's were clean and comfy despite the fact that they weren't new. Big legroom in standard seats and in the emergency row legroom was the biggest I've seen. Staff very polite and helpful. Both flights were on time. As it is a low cost airline, nothing is served for free. There are on board sales with quite a large choice but prices are also quite high (compared to other carriers). Price for the flights was really low. It was the cheapest fare, hand luggage is included along with online check in. If airBaltic is the cheapest choice you should try them.

### "listening to passengers "
I wrote a review previously which was not heaping praise on this airline. Following the review a representative of airBaltic contacted me offering an apology for the failure in service. I was pleased they are actually listening to passengers and it has made a great difference in how I view them and would recommend them as they are at least mindful of their customers views.

### "an excellent experience"
I had an excellent experience with airBaltic from Barcelona to Stockholm via Riga. The trip was very cheap, on-time, and high quality. I needed customer service' help in order to book an animal in the cabin, and they answered my call swiftly and with clear English on a Saturday morning. Despite there being two animals booked on the flight already, the lady made the effort to contact a senior member of staff out-of-hours, on his weekend, so she could override the system so that I may fly back home. She then called me back to tell me my booking was confirmed within the hour. She told me to arrive early to the airport so that Customer Service could be at my assistance in case anyone opposed the booking, and told me not to check-in online, but to do so at the airport at no extra charge. At the airport, I had no trouble checking in, and was not charged extra. No other airline has ever gone through that sort of trouble for me. I highly recommend airBaltic. Just beware of the non-classical luggage permission: 20kg checked luggage and 8kg total in the cabin over a maximum of two items. Not that they checked my luggage!

### "you get what you pay"
airBaltic flight from Vilnius via Riga to Helsinki. First leg was 30 min. Got even service and pre-ordered meal. FAs professional and friendly. The flight from Riga to Helsinki quite same service level. Only thing that I can complain was that the FAs rushed through the cabin to talk with each other. Not very professional. I still recommend this airline and will fly again. Low cost carrier. You get what you pay.

### "rude and unhelpful staff"
Flew airBaltic from London to St Petersburg via Riga. Really rude and unhelpful staff. Unbelievably strict and inflexible baggage policy. Punitive charges for going even a kilogram over (£38 flat fee for anything more than 20kg). For the first time ever, staff weighed everything I owned, both checked, cabin and shopping bag. They probably would have asked me to empty my pockets if they could have. All this after a disingenuous booking process that didn't properly reveal that checked baggage wasn't included in the price (buying allowance at the gate cost €80.) In total, I paid €126.43 on top of tickets that were not cheap to begin with. Worse than Ryanair.

### "budget airline service "
Gatwick to Helsinki via Riga. airBaltic is a strictly budget airline in service but not in the cost of its fares. They charge extra for everything and if you did not book directly from their website you have to go through a strange and complicated procedure to book seats and meals etc. Both flights were late. RIX to HEL no explanation was given nor apology. Service by crew was efficient and quite friendly. The food pre-ordered was terrible. Greasy. No taste whatsoever. I did not eat the salad. I ordered wine because no beer was on offer on the pre-order. They refused to swap my wine to beer on the flight though would have sold me a beer separately. No thanks. All in all an ok flight but very let down by awful and expensive food and lateness.

### "meal was a good surprise"
Everything's smooth. Boarding. Pre-ordered meal was a good surprise. Value for money. Flights on time. Even ahead. As a low cost carrier can recommend. The baggage fee is truly high. So the plane is full of hand luggage even bigger than allowed as a hand baggage. No place for winter jackets.

### "discount service"
Airbaltic is a discount airline, with discount service. Entered the Airport in Riga approx 40 minutes before deadline for luggage drop-off, as we checked in online. Due to heavy load of Christmas travelers we had to wait 50 minutes for baggage drop off. In the beginning 3 counters was open but eventually the 2 of them closed down and a single counter was the only one to deal with all these passengers. Luckily the flight ended up being delayed so we made it, but several wasn't that lucky. The support and the level of information from airbaltic was none existing.

### "do not recommend this airline"
I had a ticket on Estonian Air but since that airline went bust before the flight I had to book airBaltic Riga. It was unpleasant experience - firstly, the airBaltic ticket was more expensive; secondly, on the top of that they charged for each bag of luggage checked in (did not charge for carry-on bags though, what a relief!). But the most outrageous thing was that when I started an online check-in 3 days before the flight, all available seats on both legs had a price tag written on them? I had to pay extra to check-in online for each leg and for each passenger, which was just a little less then 10 euros that airBaltic threatens to charge for airport check-in (also for each passenger and each leg). This does look like a scam scheme and I will not fly and do not recommend flying this airline ever.

### "cabin service was very good"
Having had a bad airBaltic flight from Gatwick to Riga earlier this year, I did have some doubts over the quality of service, however I could not have wished for a better set of crew. We left Berlin Tegel on time and arrived into Riga approx. 15 minutes early. The cabin service was very good and slick, bordering on excellent. We were kept informed from the cockpit of the flights progress. On arrival at Riga we parked on a stand away from the terminal and the buses to take to the terminal were at the bottom of the steps as the doors opened - unlike Luton were you have to wait up to 30 minutes. The pre ordered meal was tasty and edible which was a change form my last flight. The aircraft was clean and tidy, with no rubbish to be seen

### "the dullest livery going"
Plane left a touch late due to airBaltic's odd timetable, which features 5 of its planes all leaving at 11.15 pm. We were told to refer to our safety cards in the seat pocket though there were none in the two seats in front of me. I find the whole approach to the safety demonstration on airlines archaic and unrealistic. Inflatable safety vests? They could be more of a hazard and hindrance in an emergency than a help. We should get real about this. Flight fine, though airBaltic could offer tea or coffee, and prices are not budget ones. airBaltic has the dullest livery going.

### "kept us informed throughout"
Very well mannered, friendly crew. Well informed throughout, providing us transfer information regularly as we were running 10 mins late. The captain was excellent, didn't catch his name (sounded Scottish). He kept us informed throughout, told us to look our for some views coming in and generally felt is safe hands.

### "served by friendly cabin crew"
airBaltic from Riga to Vienna with a fairly early departure from Riga at 7:20. Boarding was done via bus, fairly quick. Only 5 passengers in business served by friendly cabin crew. There was cold starter, warm omelet, yogurt and coffee during the 2hr flight. Both flight and cabin announcements were clear.

### "there was no meal available for me"
Flew Air Baltic from Brussels to Riga. There was a problem with the Business Class meals, so there was no meal available for me. I had to choose a snack out of the economy onboard menu. Rather disappointing because for other business class passengers there were meals, so I had to look at their meals and eat my awful lasagne. An airline should know how many business class passengers are travelling and provide the correct number of meals. The crew were nice and attentive, the aircraft was clean.

### "I was not disappointed with airBaltic"
airBaltic is a budget airline and I was not disappointed. The return fare, including all taxes etc was GBP80. As I was only visiting RIX for a few days, I travelled 'light' with only cabin baggage (amazing how much you can get in the bag and still be under the 8kg). Booked online via the website and all restrictions etc were clearly stated, including the free online check-in. Ground staff and flight attendants courteous and helpful. One suggestion for airBaltic - perhaps the online check-in could be more than the 72 hours before flight departs to enable check-in for the return flight. Although nothing to do with airBaltic, my return gave me my strangest-yet 'experience' of airport security. I was found to have 'contraband' by security. My offence was that I had a small disposable cigarette lighter (never had this problem before). It was duly deposited in the 'contraband' container. Walked about 20 paces from security and purchased another lighter from an 'airside' news stand!

### airBaltic customer review
I flew a return leg of my journey from Riga back to London on 14th August on airBaltic with my two children (aged 2 and 7). I was informed that because my child is over 2 years old I would need to pay to carry the buggy on board. This was not the case on the London-Riga flight : I was not informed of this condition, nor was I asked to pay any money. The assistant at the check in desk in Riga was rude and unhelpful and stated that this was an error made by the London crew and was accused of being "lucky" in London, but insisted that I would still need to pay 40Euro this time if I wanted to take the buggy for my child. I felt I was being held to ransom - this was an airBaltic error and any other company worth their weight would waive the charge with a smile in view of the fact that their original mistake allowed me to travel with a buggy and this was a return flight home. I insisted to speak to the customer service officer at the airBaltic office in Riga International Airport, who were just as unsympathetic, continued to blame London crew and insisted I paid. I was however given a feedback leaflet and told that I could fill that in if I wanted to voice my concerns over the handling of this situation - not helpful. When I requested to speak to a senior line manager, I was informed that no such person is available, despite me pointing out that this was a Friday - a working day and during office hours. To add insult to injury, the flight crew member actually flicked a "talk to the hand" gesture in my face when I asked her for assistance as myself and the two young children were attempting to settle into our seats! I have been a loyal customer (with PINS) to this company over a decade, electing to fly with this more expensive airline despite many cheaper alternatives available for the same route, but this is the most appalling customer service I have experienced from any company. This unacceptable treatment was most upsetting to me as a parent flying alone with two children. I expect airBaltic to take much better care of its loyal customers, parents with children and on a humane level - any person in their care. Following this incident I shall not be recommending airBaltic.

### airBaltic customer review
I was about to fly to Munchen from Tallin via Riga and my baggage allowance was 20kg. First time, When I weigh my baggage it was 22 kg. So they said I need to pay 50 euro more, I repacked again and it was 21 kg - kept saying I needed to pay 50 euro more, I did it again, and it was 20.kg. kept saying, Need to pay 50 euro more. Finally I made it 20.00 kg again and got on the board. I had repacked three times to make it exactly. What a stupid system - they have no flexibility.

### airBaltic customer review
The outbound flight was one of the worst flights I have ever experienced, in over 40 years of flying both as crew and a fare paying passenger. The handling agents (aviator) at LGW tried to charge for a hold bag which had already been paid for. Then the agent concerned to add insult to injury upgraded her friends who were on the flight in front of me at the boarding gate. The cabin crew were rude, surly, and never smiled once during the flight. On the flight the on-board service was rubbish, just fell short of them throwing the food at you. The pre purchased hot meal was over cooked which meant most of the meal was wasted. The cabin crew were a total let down to the airline. However the return flight was different and I cannot praise the cabin crew highly enough, they were friendly, and could not do enough for you. The pre ordered food was excellent and the cabin service was slick and efficient. On the return there were regular updates from the cockpit - outbound there were none only the internal messages to the crew. My advice is be careful when booking as the flight arrival times in Riga can make the outward travel in Latvia expensive or may mean an overnight stop in Riga. Also the airlines fleet of Boeing 737 is fairly old with an average airfame age of 11 years. My rating for the out bound flight LGW-RIX is 0 and for the return flight is 9, so I have given the airline an overall rating of 5/10.

### airBaltic customer review
Flew LGW to RIX return. Excellent service. Didn't have to put anything in the hold but I have before and I have used their online service to pay for it. This time was a backpack booked myself in online printed my ticket and went straight to security. Flights were all on time and if you want to buy food or drink on board that is available as well. Crew were very friendly. I would indeed fly them again and again.

### airBaltic customer review
When I fly a budget airlines I expect a budget experience Air Baltic was hardly a budget airline. Between baggage fees and airfare my ticket cost more than if I'd flown Lufthansa. I flew Air Baltic from VNO to LGW via RIX. The people on the Vilnius-Riga leg were friendly enough but the system for check in was ridiculous. I was traveling on a business class ticket which meant I was allowed 2 pieces of hand luggage even according to the sign at check-in. Yet the woman insisted that I was only permitted one. I also knew I might have to pay for my checked bags. Fine but simply printing my boarding passes took roughly 35 minutes from the time I got to the counter. The woman at check in had to call someone else to get prices even though I knew it was €40 per bag. Then another woman had to come down to take my payment. She came but then had to leave before taking my payment. I was asked to wait for her to come back. I finally got my boarding passes but was still waiting to pay. After waiting for about 15 minutes they told me to go up to the ticketing office to pay there. So I went upstairs and stood in line for another 45 minutes. There was only one woman working. I felt bad for her but she was incredibly slow. There was no priority given to large number of people who had to pay and still get through security. Instead she handled lengthy non-time sensitive matters first. By the time I made it out of the ticketing office the security line was horrendously backed up. I barely made it through security in time. Again people were friendly on the plane but the aircraft was old and didn't look particularly well maintained. On top of that the landing in Riga was one of the worst I have experienced in quite some time. Do yourself a favor if you can and fly another airline.

### airBaltic customer review
I recently travelled from Budapest to Riga and found the whole experience totally unprofessional and unacceptable. I had to pay additional fees for check in and baggage which I have never experienced before. The plane was old the service was terrible. I will never fly with them again. The attitude of the staff was terrible with little or no explanation. Stay away do not fly with these people.

### airBaltic customer review
Having recently flown from London Gatwick to Riga and on to St Petersburg and returned. I can honestly say this is the worst airline I have encountered. Not for the plane or cabin staff or indeed punctuality. But by their shambolic systems and un-user friendly attitude rules and regulations. Otherwise have illustrated their ludicrous check in policy/costs and exorbitant charges in more and better detail than I as a transfer passenger you are simply left to your own devices and ignored. If there is an alternative to wherever you wish to fly to please take it.

### airBaltic customer review
I flew from BRU-RIX-HEL-RIX-BRU between Dec 29 and Jan 5th. If flying with them I would recommend familiarizing yourself with their baggage policies especially if booking via eDreams because it is not pointed out very conspicuously. I ended up paying nearly 80 Euros for my baggage which I thought was included in the ticket price. My ticket cost about the same as my SK flights between BRU and HEL during the same period last year which included one checked bag. They are also anal retentive about the 20kg limit. My suitcase weighed 218 kg and the check in clerk made me remove stuff to get it under the 20kg limit. This really makes no sense for two reasons. 1) It went in my hand luggage which was transported on the same aircraft. The 1.9 kg that went in my hand luggage was unlikely to put the 737 over its MTOW. 2) It encourages oversized hand luggage. There was no enforcement of the 8kg and max physical size rule. On a small aircraft like a Dash-8 this can create huge problems in the event of an evacuation. My transit experience at their home base of RIX was absolutely fine. There were more than adequate food options which for the EU were reasonably priced. Very good free wifi as well. I had to stay at the airport overnight for my connection to BRU and found some very comfortable leather couches in one of the bar areas which was kept open overnight. On the return flight I was confused as to how they picked their aircraft choice. Jumping the puddle from HEL-RIX was done using a Boeing 737. However flying the 2hr 40mins from RIX-BRU was completed inside a Dash 8 puddle jumper. This is illogical. The seats were cramped for this length of flight and this was quite possibly the first time in my life that I did not at least enjoy the 'flying' portion of a flight. While the cabin crew was friendly and professional and the aircraft were for all intents and purposes spotless I don't think I would recommend the airline. When I added up the hassles over baggage and the extra fees I could have easily flown SK for the same price. Air Baltic needs to either be slightly more flexible in its baggage policies or lower their ticket prices significantly. For a LCC it is overpriced.

### airBaltic customer review
Before booking with them I'd read the reviews here and was in two minds whether to fly with them or not. I booked LGW to RIX and after a long weekend in Riga booked onwards to LED. The only hiccup I had was the online check-in for my Gatwick to Riga flight but an email was responded to promptly and the problem sorted. Both flights were totally hassle-free the price was right staff were friendly and attentive and I have no complaints whatsoever. Even the onboard snack and drinks selection I didn't find particularly expensive.

### airBaltic customer review
I was flying with my 13 year old son from Milan to Helsinki via Riga 17th Oct 2014 flight BT630. There was a passenger who obviously had consumed considerable amount of alcohol and was behaving aggressively and disturbed us. The cabin crew continued serving more alcohol to him. The head of the crew did not offer any help to us but instead of offering to change seats. Me and my son were extremely upset and disappointed with the staff.

### airBaltic customer review
No problem with online check-in - had booked tickets using Air Baltic website at a good price paid for hold luggage when booking so all very easy until reaching Tallinn airport. Flight was to Stockholm with a transfer at Riga and first leg was delayed for an hour. Staff had no idea why but our Air Baltic connection could have waited as there were about 20 of us on the same route. The reason for the delay according to the aircrew was a technical fault and a wait for the replacement aircraft the transfer desk said it was bad weather either way we had a wait of over 3 hours at Riga with a voucher for a biscuit and undrinkable coffee. Got into Stockholm 4 hours later than planned. The lesson to be learnt here is never take such a short flight with a transfer and avoid the last flight of the day from the carrier to your chosen destination as small delays during the day build up to a big one in the end otherwise everything was fine.

### airBaltic customer review
Surprisingly pleasant experience despite prior scepticism. Properly educating yourself of Air Baltic's policies in advance is likely key here. AMS-RIX-ARN in Y solely for a 22-hour layover to see a bit of Riga. Paid baggage fees in advance checked in online. Staff in AMS and RIX pleasant and quick. No hassle picking up checked bags at RIX and re-checking next morning. Though we were very careful it turned out that hand luggage was never weighed in either AMS or RIX. Many frequent passengers with heavier bags did not seem concerned so I somewhat suspect this policy may be (very sensibly) a bit more relaxed now than it was; will go a long way for goodwill. Crews on both flights were attentive and surprisingly smiley for Eastern Europe (not a judgement just unexpected). Flights on time. B733 old but clean Q400 newer and also clean. Legroom standard for short European flights. Overall a pleasant experience. Would be cautiously optimistic to fly with BT again to RIX or if fares were significantly less than SK or KL on this route. Would recommend with caveat that one should carefully learn policies before booking.

### airBaltic customer review
Short 50-minute hops on Dash 8 Q400s TLL-RIX and RIX-VNO. I had booked my tickets via an online booking agency so was dismayed to be informed on checking in at TLL that I would be charged a supplementary fee. Fearing that this would be a swoon-inducing off-the-scale penalty as imposed by certain budget airlines I was relieved that the charge was only EUR 10. Furthermore I was advised I could upgrade to an extra comfort seat with no-one next to me this for another EUR 20. Done deal off I went happy - only to discover that the flight was only one-third full and we all had ample space. Two days later at RIX I presented myself at the ticket sales desk to request payment of the check-in supplement only to be directed to a self-check-in machine at zero extra cost. This flight was also one-third full. At least I can say that Air Baltic was very charming when they relieved me of my EUR 30 at TLL.

### airBaltic customer review
I chose this company as it had good fares for our trip however by the end of the trip if I sum up all the expenses it required along the way I could have bought tickets for a better airline that provides all the needed services. We had to pay 10 eur per person to do check-in at the counter. Who has heard of that? We received an email a few days before with the online check-in and it didn't state anywhere that if we don't do it online we would have to pay at the airport. Not surprisingly at the airport everyone who was on the same flight with us had the very same problem. The company is not transparent with its customers and it uses these hidden fees so they can cover up their margins. We had to pay extra for every 20 kg piece of luggage seats transaction fees and there were no meals during the flights. So adding up all these costs to the initial price of the ticket I could have easily flown with an all inclusive airline. Coming to customer service it seems that Air Baltic has no idea what that means. One crew member was extremely rude during the boarding process. She replied to my questions in a very rude way. It is sad to see that for some companies the idea of customer service is still a new concept.

### airBaltic customer review
We were travelling to Riga from LGW. Firstly Air Baltic moved the flight time from mid morning to late afternoon. Then as we reached the runway the pilot announced we did not have permission to take off as we were "too heavy". This entailed a return to the gate. Mail and other cargo was removed as clearly this was a major very serious error on the part of Air Baltic. We were not allowed to leave the plane and in the overall three hours before finally taking off all we were given was 3 ounces of water. Landing was not until five hours had elapsed in the plane and by then there was some distr0ess with children and some pregnant ladies as there is only one toilet between 140 economy passengers. Cabin crew spent their time standing in front of the Business class toilet preventing any Economy passenger from using it. With no complementary drinks or vouchers and final landing well past midnight the customer care of this airline is nil and should be avoided if possible.

BT642 on June 20th. BT641 on June 28th. ZRH-RIX-ZRH. Although AirBaltic has a nice homepage its complicated to operate and "forgets" settings that you have made (e.g. I selected check-in bags for both the outbound and inbound flights I had to enter this several times and in the end this was only picked up for the outbound flight so I had to pay extra for the inbound flight at the airport). Check-in at the airport costs extra but online check-in and mobile boarding passes do work. No food & beverages not even water. The planes are really old.

### airBaltic customer review
RIX-BCN flight. Business is not business. Meal was inedible. The stewardesses are friendly the company is an expensive cheap service company. The offers lack integrity and the overall client attitude is negative.

### airBaltic customer review
We had a good flight from RIX to DUS. The online-check-in was fast and easy and the staff on board were very friendly. We ordered drinks in advance and got them at the very beginning of the service. The Dash 8 had modern interior and good comfort but no inflight entertainment (which is normal for that type of plane). I can only recommend this airline to anybody travelling to and through Riga.

### airBaltic customer review
DUS-RIX. Mobile Check-In was easy and fast no app needed. Plane was a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400. The plane was nice quite new a little noisy inside but the seat pitch was better than on most other airlines I have traveled with. We pre-ordered drinks online which we received very fast and had a cheese plate with olives which was tasty too but food and drinks are costly. Staff on board were really friendly and spoke good English. Flight was on time. But: no inflight entertainment but no magazines or newspapers offered only the airlines onboard magazine. All in all I can recommend this airlines.

### airBaltic customer review
Prague - Riga - Moscow. Flight Prague-Riga: The personnel in Prague were very nice. The crew members - not even a smile or 'Hello'. Seats - very narrow and uncomfortable. No meal or drinks on board. Not even water. But you can buy it or order when purchasing your ticket. Riga airport. First international airport with no drinking water fountains! No announcements! No signs to find your terminal or even to understand where you are! Flight Riga- Moscow: Poor service I did not like the attitude. I do not recommend this airline.

### airBaltic customer review
I paid about 75 euros to check one 23kg bag. That is a lot of money for such a simple thing. Every other airline uses 23kg limits. Now I think I understand why they are so limited. Air Baltic's planes are so old and out of date. That plane was something I would have rode on 20 years ago.

### airBaltic customer review
FCO-RIX-FCO. My outbound flight was rescheduled 2 weeks prior the flight and I had only two options either to accept the change or cancel the whole trip. Overall expensive tickets old Boeing planes hidden charges and poor customer service and support. I would not recommend this airline.

### airBaltic customer review
I had a terrible flight with Air Baltic especially because of the behaviour of their staff. In PLQ they like to shout at passengers "You have to pay" the only thing which produces a smile with their staff. 5 Minutes later it was checked that I did not have to pay. In RIX no boarding announcement at all boarding started too early which made passengers wait on an unheated plane for more than half an hour until the last passengers arrived. Outside temp: 4 degrees. Onboard staff were not taking care of passengers in any way they don't have blankets but were happy to sell their tea for incredibly high price.

### airBaltic customer review
RIX-SVO - extremely slow check in at Riga airport. Crew not friendly and I was denied a claim form on board. The customer service is just odd. It is a very expensive low cost service. The food on board is really expensive.

### airBaltic customer review
Flew from London to Riga. For the first time ever had to pay $9 for just flight registration and $35 for luggage. Was a total shock to me and all other passengers registering at the same time since it was not mentioned during ticket purchase. Water onboard was $2.50. Would recommend to avoid this airline by all means.

### airBaltic customer review
PRG-RIX-KBP. Probably one of our worst experiences. When we got to the Prague airport we were told that we had to pay 150 euros for 3 checked bags (none were overweight) and our boarding passes which apparently we were supposed to print out before if we didn't want to be charged (which we didn't know about). We took the bus to the Bombardier Q400 and we boarded without many problems and sat into the small seats. We were absolutely baffled when we found out that we had to PAY for everything on-board not even a glass of water or juice was free. We then landed and spent the next 4 hours in Riga where we exchanged 20 US dollars for Lats so that we could buy something to drink and eat. We were able to only buy 6 small water bottles and 4 snacks for those 20 dollars. The second flight to Kiev had the same circumstances and again would have to pay for a small drink. This time we were on an old Boeing 737-300 which had larger seats. Flight attendants are non existent throughout all flights. Never flying Air Baltic again.

### airBaltic customer review
I have flown with Air Baltic for many years and generally there are no issues with time keeping and technical faults. On board staff are generally helpful. Customer Service could be better especially at check in in Riga - often long queues that merge into one - airport check in area is rather small and often the queue is out of the door so it pays to arrive earlier. Airport airside is pretty good now with the addition of new shops. I generally travel the London/Riga/London route which is nearly always full. Tend to be expensive at times - out of season usually the better deal. At least assigned seats - unlike the free for all on Ryanair in which case if you are not Latvian or Russian you will not win because they are queuing for plane 30 mins before boarding starts - look out for the passengers who stand up immediately the wheels touch the runway preparing to get off - it always amuses me.

### airBaltic customer review
From Riga to Villnius. The Dh8 is very good aircraft for regional flight. On time take off and landing. Everything o/b you must pay for. I ordered one hot chocolate. Very nice taste. Ground staff at Riga airport were so helpful. Crew were friendly to all passengers.

### airBaltic customer review
We were to fly Larnaca-Riga-Copenhagen at 04.30am on July 28th. Arrived at the airport at 02.00 found that the plane from Riga had never arrived and ground crew had not received any information about this and knew nothing. All passengers had to be re-routed and re-booked via other destinations. Even though we had the right to vouchers for meals drinks and phone calls ground staff could not get in contact with Air Baltic in Riga and only gave us a voucher for 3.50 in their cafeteria. Not even enough to buy a cup of coffee! Re-routed via Zurich and even though they said we were booked on a flight to CPH this was not the case we had to wait until a seat became available on a flight. Had to collect luggage go through customs and then wait to check in again. Ticket looks very cheap but there are a multitude of hidden costs once the ticket is booked. They do not even give you water on the plane without a charge. We will never fly Air Baltic again!

### airBaltic customer review
ZRH-RIX return older Boeing 737-300 in both directions with recently refurbished Recaro seats that were OK but a little cramped. Air Baltic is fine as a low-cost airline - I managed to buy my tickets in a sale - and I appreciated being able to pre-order a proper airline meal with a starter main soft drink and dessert rather than only being able to buy snacks. The lunch was good on the way out and felt like good value for money compared to Zurich Airport but the breakfast on the return was not so good (powdered instant coffee) and was expensive and of a lower quality compared to Riga Airport. Ordering in advance gives you a much larger selection but isn't really cheaper as far as I could see. On-time on the way out 25 mins late on the way in due to bad weather in ZRH but I didn't feel this was really explained. Nice staff. However the ticket prices are often decidedly not low-cost and then what you get for the price is rather scandalous given that you have to pay for all the extras.

### airBaltic customer review
Inefficient unhelpful and rude staff at check-in in Tashkent. Charged an additional 40 Euros for luggage despite being an economy not a basic ticket which according to the official website should allow 20kgs free of charge. A scribbled receipt was issued after persistent requests. First flight from Tashkent to Riga took off and arrived on time. Second flight from Riga to Istanbul was late to depart by 30 minutes. Riga airport was chaotic no information was given regarding the lateness of the plane. The planes were adequate the on board flight attendants polite. Poor value and I would not use this airline again.

### airBaltic customer review
Travelled HEL-RIX-KBP and back 19-22 July. The online booking and check-in (opens 72 hours before flight) straightforward website easy to navigate. All flights (except the last leg which was 25 min late on arrival) on time. The planes were oldish 737's (except RIX-KBP which was DH4 turboprop) but seemed in good shape and were clean. Seat pitch probably a shade less than major European airlines. The staff was very friendly and onboard service was impeccable. Nothing is free though. Riga airport is quite messy at 11pm when all flights arrive and depart.

### airBaltic customer review
VIE-RIX-TAS-RIX-VIE. VIE-RIX flown on small Dash 8 aircraft. We pre-booked a hot meal which was good. Also pre- booked seats which proved to be useless. Arrival to RIX was smooth. Had 5 hours between the flights so we went to Riga for a short sightseeing by public transportation. Boarding in RIX was a mess - flight delayed almost no information small waiting room crowded bus to the aircraft. Although we booked emergency exit row seats for quite a high fee our seats were in front of the emergency exit row - the most uncomfortable seats on the aircraft which was an older run-down B737. Very bad flight experience on this leg with some of the lavatories not working TAS airport is like going back in time it took two hours to get the visa and pass immigration and customs. Return flightt slightly better smoother check-in friendlier staff aircraft in a better condition although also one of the lavatories not working. Altogether the services provided was of lower quality than most low-cost airlines.

### airBaltic customer review
GYD-RIX-SVO. Air Baltic is a 'cheap' US-style carrier. Air Baltic appeared to be the least expensive option. Arrived at GYD to discover that I had to pay 40 euro in cash for the privilege of checking a single bag. Had I known this beforehand I would have factored it into the price and chosen a different airline. On the plane I was told that I would have to pay for water if I wanted a drink! If I wanted poor American-style service and 'hidden fees' I would have stayed in America for my vacation. Also the plane didn't have the customary map TV on the seat in front of me. For a European airline Air Baltic is absolutely dire. Will never fly again.

### airBaltic customer review
CPH-RIX-VNO. The Plane was cancelled no rebooking to other Airlines was offered. No meal vouchers or other compensation issued for the 4 hour waiting time. No explanations just a person in CPH airport telling they had been ordered to not rebook passengers. Also I was provided no contact information to Air Baltic customer service. In RIX it was no better - after haggling I was issued a meal voucher which turned out to to get me a cup of coffee and a biscuit even though I was told "you can get whatever you want". I arrived in VNO 8 hours later than scheduled. By the way you have to pay extra for luggage and for meals and drinks on-board. Never ever again am I going to fly Air Baltic.

TLV-RIX-CDG. Normal LCC. Prices on board ok. Planes new and clean staff friendly. Had some hours in Riga and visited the city. Was sleeping during the flights so missing IFE was no problem.

### airBaltic customer review
We were on our way home from Riga. When we were checking in our luggage we were told to go to the ticket office. They didn't know why but we had to go there. We guessed that the plane was cancelled. We found the ticket office and they told us they had to use a smaller plane and they didn't have enough seats so we had to travel via Munich. We got our tickets after a long while but with wrong names on every one of them. They couldn't understand this and used a very long time to sort it out. When they did the plane for Munich had left and the started to look for another way home for us. We were then directed via Berlin 4 hours later and had to wait in Berlin for another 2.5 hour. Of course no apologies or meals/drinks etc.

### airBaltic customer review
Connecting flight from Moscow (DME) to Duesseldorf via Riga. Flight attendants and overall service was OK for a discount airline. Had to pay extra charges (approx EUR 25) for choosing seats in the aircraft which was not worth the money paid. Planes (Dash 8 on both routes) were quite new but very noisy. Passport control in Riga airport was a total disaster. Queue was moving extremely slow staff very rude. Flight on the second leg has been delayed for 1.5 hours as the aircraft required some maintenance. Overall impression is not bad but wouldn't recommend anyone to use connecting flights via Riga.

### airBaltic customer review
RIX-ZRH-RIX. Both flights without any delays polite and responsive cabin crew good check-in Riga airport comparatively fast security control. The only negative experience was Zurich airport check-in staff whose lack of knowledge and impoliteness made our trip back home less enjoyable. I would like to highlight security check staff in Zurich airport who were very understanding. I complained about the unfounded expenses I paid for airport check in ZRH they returned money on time so in general I am more or less satisfied.

### airBaltic customer review
TLV-VNO (via RIX) and back end of July 2012. Hidden charges they add 5 euro when completing booking without notice on the early stages of reservation. They supply water on board only for payment of 2.50 euro per 75 ml bottle. The rest of the service is good. They should add these expenses to the ticket price to not make passengers angry.

### airBaltic customer review
Riga to Vilnius 2 weeks ago. This was booked online with the Air Baltic site easy to use. Staff at check in were pleasant and gave me an aisle seat as requested no hassle with luggage and in fact my booking allowed 2 extra kilos (I didn't need it though) The flight was on time and smooth running. I would use Air Baltic again and also recommend it to others.

### airBaltic customer review
LGW-RIX-LGW - first time with Air Baltic. Online checking seamless boarding quick and easy inflight service what you would expect with any budget carrier. Both flights arrived and departed on time. No issues at all with this airline and if I had to fly to Riga again I'd happily fly Air Baltic.

### airBaltic customer review
Stockholm - Riga - Kiev and back. Old Boeing airplanes on all legs fairly clean. Punctual but all flying times are overestimated on timetable. Staff professional but unfriendly and sometimes even rude. Ridiculous price for luggage! You may end up paying more than 50 euros for one piece of checked luggage. No information about this whatsoever prior to check in - very bad indeed. On the flights you have to pay for everything extra even a glass of water! Bearing in mind that Air Baltic tickets aren't especially cheap I cannot recommend this airline.

Flying from Vienna to Riga. Flight was 2 hrs long. The only inflight entertainment was a magazine the seat pitch and width was small. The flight attendants were bad the food and baggage was expensive as well.

### airBaltic customer review
A good airline with good value for money. On the downside is their baggage rules 1 bag on a round trip costs approx €60 - same as the airfare. Although they cooperate with SAS and recognises Eurobonus privileges this does not apply to baggage allowance. Ground staff and crew were fantastic.

Flight Riga-Amsterdam - delayed which meant I wouldn't meet my connection so I needed to change the ticket. Called AB customer helpline several times and asked airport staff to contact AB - no one form AirBaltic showed up or helped. As a result I was stranded in airport overnight - no vouchers no blankets no sign from AB. They simply ignore you. Never again.

Round trip Tel Aviv to Riga. B737 both ways both flights red eyes which is great for connections in Riga but terrible for the body. All leather seats leg room tight. Crew very polite. All the rest is "buy onboard". Not even water. I paid 500 euro for this flight so by no mean a low cost ticket and not being served a thing onboard felt like LCC taken to extreme. Ground staff in Riga polite and helpful. Will fly again as they are the only ones going non-stop to Riga but not looking forward for the experience.

### airBaltic customer review
Had to pay for luggage although was not informed by my agent about this extra cost (almost everyone in the check in queue had a similar unpleasant surprise feeling). Seats were old with a large pitch. Charging people for drinks on-board made the service slow and annoying. Tickets were pricey. Will never fly with them again.

HEL-RIX. I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. There are several optional extras to pay for including checked luggage advance seat reservation food etc. but the service was excellent. Check-in was simple with no wait at all boarding prompt and efficient and in-flight food service quick and efficient too. My seat had decent leg room. The cabin crew were warm and polite and disembarkation and luggage collection fast.

Normally I fly once a year to Vilnius to visit family and find Air Baltic a cheap and reliable option. However this year flew from Tblisi-RIX and RIX to Amsterdam. Flights left promptly clean aircraft the inflight food was good but on the other hand at the price paid it would be expected. Upon arrival due to an error in Tblisi I did not have the documents however Air Baltic staff kindly got the bus to wait while I printed thus removing the stress of having to wait another half hour. Riga-Amsterdam flight also good and in fact landed early. Staff were polite and helpful throughout and were quick to sort the connections out from Riga.

### airBaltic customer review
DUB-RIX-TLL. Great service friendly staff hassle free transfer through Riga even with a very tight connection (35 minutes) and all for 76 euro. As with other budget carriers if you read the small print and ensure that cabin/checked baggage meets requirements there should be no complaints. As a regular traveller on the Dublin to Tallinn route I have tried lots of airlines and flight combinations and will definitely use Air Baltic in the future. My only complaint is that the Riga flight leaves (a deserted) Dublin airport at 01.15!

My son and I flew from Tallin to Vilnius with a 1 hr 15 mins connection time in Riga. Then a few days later a flight from Riga to Malta with a connection in Vienna. We were prepared. We prepaid the 20 Euro online and made sure our allowance was under 20kg per bag and 8kg for carry-ons. No snags at check-in. The agent was courteous and helpful. The flight crews were professional and the equipment clean. We had no delays made our connections on time and no baggage problems. Before you complain about the price of checked luggage the price for a cup of coffee or the price for a sandwich check the price you paid for your ticket. You're still ahead.

First airline where I had to pay for coffee. This type of customer service takes more time to process the payment then it would to provide the coffee or water for free. Getting e-tickets online was nil.

### airBaltic customer review
I paid the extra cost to select seats in the Emergency Exit row to have the extra legroom. Air Baltic changed the aircraft to one with a different Emergency Exit row and did not change my seat reservations. Other passengers then secured the Emergency Exit rows seats meaning I paid the extra cost for nothing and had to have standard seats. Very poor service by Air Baltic to take your money and fail to provide what you paid for.

RIX-GYD. Flight delayed 5 hours. Passengers were held in the gates D area with no information for more than 1 hour after flight's departure time. Area of the gates D has neither cafe/restaurants nor smoking area - just toilets. EU citizens were allowed to cross the border and go back to the terminal while others were required to remain in the same area with no info. After 20-30 minutes passengers had to push passport control officers in order to call for airline representative. Only after that non-EU citizens were transferred to another terminal where cold food was available. However they provided meal coupons for only 1.50 LVL = 2.10 EUR. This amount was enough only for small pack of chips - even not for water! They did not care even about children flying as transit passengers and waiting for more than 10 hours in total. Also no excuses for delay from crew onboard.

WAW-RIX-TBS flights from Warsaw to Riga - very old small Fokkers. Riga to Tbilisi quite nice Boeing with comfortable seats. Only food available onboard is to purchase and luggage has to be paid for.

### airBaltic customer review
Aircraft was clean and inflight team efficient and friendly. I recognise this airline offers stripped down fares and charges for luggage and seats etc normally provided free by other carriers. In view of this it is essential to get the management of providing these extras under control and that is not what I found. Having reserved a seat online and booking priority check-in at the airport my booking was not on the system and the seat not available. On the return no priority check-in available so I queued. The worst thing was that my complaint was badly handled and I was pointed to the small print in the Conditions of Carriage saying seat reservations don't definitely reserve you a seat and Priority Check-in is not refundable. Travelling is difficult enough without this type of response from carriers. Such a pity.

### airBaltic customer review
Vilnius-Riga-Istanbul. Business class was US$20 extra for the whole trip. Check-in in Vilnius was unimpressive: business class line actually took longer than Economy. Boarding was not done by class and I was asked to re-weigh my carry-on. Once onboard things started to look up. Cheerfully greeted and offered a beverage given a very tasty hot breakfast coffee and something to read. Riga airport is a lovely modern construction and the spacious business lounge had everything you could ask for except a shower. Riga- Istanbul leg I was only passenger in business cabin. Service was excellent as the attendant waited on me hand and foot. Food was excellent. Provided something to read and an iPad2 on which to play games.

Amsterdam-Riga-Amsterdam. This was the last leg of intercontinental flight. All went smoothly however got a feeling of very impersonal service from AB. I also faced some level of check-in staff incompetence in Riga airport – my checked in luggage on the way back to Sydney was forwarded to Malaysia only – not to my final destination. According to them that was the only option they can do despite my KLM multi-leg ticket. I had to cross Malaysian border control just to collect my bag check it in again and come back into departure area for the flight to SYD. Fortunately this was the only odd thing I experienced.

### airBaltic customer review
TXL-RIX-VNO return. All flights punctual. Flight attendants were friendly pilots kept us updated. However any full-fare airline that charges for drinks and baggage can only receive a mediocre rating. It should be a gesture of courtesy to offer paying customers at least a glass of water or a hot drink in winter.

IST-RIX. RIX-LED. While boarding was a bit chaotic both flights on time and our bags were among the first off the plane.

The interiors of the planes looked quite new and the seats were quite comfortable.

There is no free inflight catering too. Hot meals from buy-on-board magazine were not provided for the last 12 rows 12 because they didn't have more then 2 portions of each meal type. There is no free beverages. Not even a glass of water. There is no free pillow and blanket only for lease for whole flight. Quality isn't worth for price of the tickets.

VIE-RIX RIX-HEL Not good value for money you have to pay 20 eur for hold baggage and you only discover this at the end of the online booking process. Zero tolerance regarding weight limits for both hold and hand luggage. Web- check-in did not work. If I pay almost 200 eur one way I expect to get at least a glass of water and or a coffee for free or at least for a reasonable price. Slow check-in at Riga even if you do it on your own at the machine you have to join the same long line in front of the counters to drop your baggage - total nonsense. Not very friendly staff in Riga cabin crew okay. Planes quite clean.

AMS-RIX-TAS-FRU and TAS-RIX-AMS. Quite comfortable for the relatively low prices especially medium distance flights (like AMS-TAS) are good value for money. The only disadvantage in my experience is the long stopover in Riga twice I had to wait the whole day in Riga for a connection flight.

Stockholm-Riga-Tallinn. Comfortable flights both legs. Regional turboprop with adequate seat pitch but narrow in width. Fortunately no person was assigned next to me (I was alone for the entire 3 rows in both legs).

Both flights were on time.

Very unfriendly ground staff at Vilnius airport. I booked my ticket and paid at Tallinn office no mention of hand baggage rules either from the employee or printed on my ticket. I checked in and was told me I could take my hand baggage as carry on. No problem at the gate no problem at transfer gate in Riga to Vilnius. But at Vilnius airport with same hand baggage on my way back to Helsinki via Riga I was harassed by a young lady until I paid 60 Euros to check in my hand baggage because it was 12 kg instead of 8.9 kg. For a 276 Euros ticket Tallinn- Vilnius-Helsinki it's really unpleasant the flight was not full the overhead lockers were empty above my seat. As I did not speak Lithuanian I had less chance than other passengers that were allowed to bring their 13 kg baggage as carry on.

They delayed our flight a couple of hours then re routed our direct Frankfurt-Moscow flight to Kiev without any warning! Made us stay on the plane in Kiev for about 3 hours while they were putting unknown cargo on the plane - it's incomprehensible how they get away with it. Our flight finally arrived to Moscow about 8 hours late. I will never fly this airline!

Second time this happened to me. When booking flight in Air Baltic page entering to payment page site threw me out unexpectedly with error message. Starting over again the price increased by 10%! After earlier incident I called them and there was a non-hesitant answer that prices are updated continuously. This makes me to believe that once I have decided to make purchase from them I will not turn away because of small increase. Neat way to increase clean profit.

### airBaltic customer review
Very unfriendly ground staff in Vilnius airport. Hand baggage rules are followed up to harassment. Constant delays and not very cheap if not booked early.

### airBaltic customer review
The only airline I've flown where the cost for my luggage (30 Euros per Kg of weight over the first 20 kg for each leg of my flight) cost more than my ticket. I paid over $700 of luggage cost from Vilnius to Paris. This is exorbitant. I will never fly this airline again. If they had just suggested I pay more to upgrade to business class which has a bigger baggage allowance I could have overall paid far less and travelled more comfortably.

I have flown with them several times. Far the biggest problem is changing schedule they have the right to cancel your flight up to 2 months before flight after that they have to find a replacement flight. Well 2 months ahead you don't really find any flights which are less than 2 times expensive than the original booking. Beware of baggage restrictions they check this without any tolerance. Food onboard is below every expectations and should be avoided. The plus part is well maintained and clean planes fast connection good space on Q400 and 757 the rest are ok. Forget about changing any tickets additional services and insurance the cheapest way always with them is cancellation. If you plan your trip well ahead it's worth it. If you go for comfort and stability its not your choice.

Horrible horrible service. They don't care at all for their customers. My flight from Stockholm to Riga was delayed and a subsequent connection to Hamburg was not possible so they got me a place to stay (as expected). Then I changed my next flight to Düsseldorf (because all flights to Hamburg were being cancelled due to volcanic ash) and then my luggage did not arrive. I found out where it was (still in Riga) by contacting their third-party luggage operator before they did it themselves. Stay away from these low prices they are trouble.

Very poor value for money. Me and my wife took a flight from Amsterdam to Tel Aviv with a stop at Riga. Air Baltic charged us EUR 30 per piece of baggage for Amsterdam-Riga and EUR 30 per piece of baggage from Riga to Tel Aviv. In total it added another EUR 120 to our costs for our flight to Tel Aviv. Another EUR 120 was charged when we got back the same way. I would stay clear from Air Baltic.

I booked a flight from Moscow to Warsaw via Riga on April 25th. The night before I tried to check in and having put in my flight locator number I was informed it was not possible to checkin online from that location and a list of cities were listed where it was possible to check-in from and yes Moscow wasn't on the list. The next day I arrived at the Domodedovo airport at 12 noon for my 1450 flight and discovered that my flight wasn't even listed. I found the Air Baltic counter and produced my e-ticket and I was informed via a computer printout that my flight was now leaving at 2245 via the Sheremetyevo Airport and that flight would arrive in Riga at 2330. This was the first I'd heard of any change so you can imagine my horror. The lady at the counter was no help as she couldn't speak English. There was no way I could catch my connecting flight to Warsaw that day and apparently Air Baltic was quite happy with the thought of having me sleep at the airport that night. Totally unimpressed with the customer service. They had my email details and didn't use them. It cost me 600 on another flight to get to Warsaw. Never ever will Air Baltic receive my business again.

Exactly the same thing happened to us. We booked a flight Dublin - Riga - Moscow for EUR 120 and Air Baltic cancelled. They asked us to request a refund via the website and this was down so I called on 25th March to request a refund. I called on 4th April to chase my refund and was told to 'be patient' then called again yesterday (6th April) and was told the refund had only been processed on that day! Not impressed with this at all.

KBP-RIX. Check in agent at Kiev very polite. Air Baltic seem to be concerned about the hand luggage limits as every passenger's one piece of luggage was affixed with a "Cabin Baggage" tag. Boarded the Boeing 737-500 via bus not a very pleasant way to board a flight but out with Air Baltic's control. Very limited space on board for hand baggage the cab=in crew member's suggestion of putting it under our seat was a bit naive since both my friend and I were too tall to fit our feet under the seats with any bags there. Eventually managed to stow our small bags under the middle seat in front as it remained unoccupied. The crew were actually friendly but strict enough with certain passengers who broke the rules (standing up whilst taxiing etc) that they reassured you of your safety. Arrived in Riga on schedule most passengers were connecting elsewhere but for the rest of us the luggage arrived very quickly. I'd definitely fly Air Baltic again as they are very good value for money if you book early enough.

Poor customer service and support! We purchased two direct round-trip non-refundable flights from Ireland to Riga in mid-February for travel in late May for roughly $600 then made our non-refundable hotel reservations in Riga and Ireland. Air Baltic cancelled our flights in mid-March with a form letter telling us to "have a nice flight". They offered to put us on flights 2 days later on departure and 1 day early on return. I informed the AirBaltic that we had non-negotiable hotel reservations and asked AirBaltic to work with us with their air travel partners to get us on other alternate flights to Riga on our established travel dates for roughly the same cost. I provided the specific flight connection info. No substantive response was from them. I then requested a full refund on the website. The website was non- functional. I sent them an email to requested a refund and rebooked through another airline at a cost of more than $500 above our original AirBaltic fare. AirBaltic still provides the short Baltic Sea overflight. The beneficiary of this fare scam appears to be AirBaltic operating with minimal competition in the Riga air travel market . They are charging us more for a short hop flight than our original Dublin-Riga round-trip. Avoid them if you can.

### airBaltic customer review
Pleasant experience on numerous return flights from Riga to different airport across Europe - use it on a monthly basis for flights between Riga and London alone. It's not really a low- cost airline so it wouldn't be fair to compare it to Ryanair or easyJet which it stands superior to.

### airBaltic customer review
Very expensive to check in baggage unfriendly staff etc. Air Baltic is not a low cost airline! Tickets are very expensive and very often when you are booking tickets on their web site an error occurs and when you start over again the price is almost double!

### airBaltic customer review
TLL-RIX-KPB economy. High overall price despite being advertised as low cost carrier. €190 for one way. Staff young and fresh but quite comfortable and fast few smiles could be added though. Legroom is good enough for a short flight. Delay in RIX for 30 min. Overall I would fly with them again. Food looks goods but prices seem to be outrage us.

### airBaltic customer review
SVO-RIX-SVO. I liked both flights. The crew was friendly and efficient. All flights on time. The food which was on sale on-board was very good! Legroom was a bit insufficient for me but I guess it's an OK situation for a low-cost airline.

### airBaltic customer review
RIX-AMS. Completely inadequate experience and will never use this airline again. In Amsterdam there was a massive queue - I arrived 2 hours in advance but despite that I noticed everything was moving so slowly at the airport simply because not enough desks were open. Being concerned about missing my flight I walked up to the desk indicating I was worried to miss my flight and was told not to worry. When it was finally my turn to check in I was told I was too late for check in and they cancelled my ticket. When confronting them with the situation that I was assured not to worry they started laughing and was also told that they would not reimburse the money - ended up flying Lufthansa instead.

### airBaltic customer review
TLV-RIX and RIX-AMS. Flight crew professional and efficient. We didn't try anything off the menu but it looked okay if maybe a little meager in portion size. Be careful if you're flying through/from RIX as they check all your hand luggage for size and weight.

London Gatwick to Palanga via Riga. I did know about baggage costs and paid for this online and had no problems at check in. The service on board was not something I required but staff were courteous and attentive. The planes were clean and fairly new and comfortable. All flights were on time except my return from Palanga to Riga which was delayed by fog in Riga. Overall my experience of Air Baltic was quite reasonable. Pre booking meals can be cheaper than buying once aboard and it is always possible to take your own food and drink on board to keep down the costs if this is an issue.

### airBaltic customer review
Riga to London Gatwick. The flight was busy but on time. Cabin crew in general friendly but could do with a bit of less attitude. The aircraft was new and clean. Have to pay for food and hold luggage separate. The in-flight menu was excellent and food was very reasonably priced and tasty though drinks were little pricey. Tickets can be expensive if not purchased well in advance.

### airBaltic customer review
RIX-CPH on airBaltic. Check in and security was a breeze. No proper restaurant airside. Boarding efficient. The new Dash-8 was spotless. Everything went fine. Coffee is overpriced at €225 and it is instant coffee! Service otherwise ok (actually there is no service).

Dushanbe-Riga-London Gatwick. This is a long flight (5 hours to Riga) with a chaotic check in at Dushanbe where most passengers seemed to have to go out of the check in area to change money to pay for hold baggage which they thought had been included in their ticket (including me). Luckily had the middle seat free between myself and fellow passenger so lack of seat space was not as acute as it could have been. Did not buy any food on the flight from Dushanbe to Riga/London. Riga-London was OK. Although arrivals at Gatwick was packed was able to use IRIS automated immigration barrier to avoid the wait. There is very limited choice if travelling to/from Dushanbe - basically it's either Air Baltic or Turkish Airlines. If the travel dates coincide with Turkish Airlines I would go with them rather than Air Baltic.

While booking electronic ticket on Internet for my father I made a mistake writing my first name instead of his. I discovered it immediately after the booking and called the sales office in Lithuania asking to change the name. They said this would costs around euro 80. This is more than the price I paid for one way ticket Vilnius-Copenhagen. No account given to the fact that I acted promptly. When I asked whether I could turn to somebody elsE at the company I was told e-mail of the customer service office. I sent them a polite e-message and probably a dozen of reminders but never received an answer. The customer service appears to be as bad as at the worst low-fare companies. My advice If having possibility use other companies.

### airBaltic customer review
The check in at Riga is unacceptably slow chaotic and overcrowded. If you check in at a machine you have to join a long queue to hand in your baggage. Their attitude is unhelpful and unfriendly. Meals and drinks in flight are not free glass of water is extortionate - about five times the cost of a small bottle - and that is just for a glass.

This is my second bad experience with Air Baltic. The first time I had a direct flight from Berlin to Vilnius and the plane was overbooked so they sent me via Warsaw so instead of 1.5 hour travel time I ended up traveling for 5 hours. Second time I had a direct ticket from Oslo to Vilnius. My flight was canceled and I was offered either a refund or a different non-direct flight in the evening instead of morning. I chose a refund and still waiting for it. The representative told me that it will take at least 6 weeks to get a refund!

Gatwick to Vilnius and back. The flights were punctual and service was very polite and friendly. The new seating is very comfortable.

### airBaltic customer review
My wife and I travelled to VNO from LGW . The price was very reasonable. B737-500 seats were comfortable captain extremely informative and cabin crew were helpful yet not obtrusive. On the outward leg we were delayed and diverted by fog over Vilnius. We were diverted to Kaunas yet only waited 15-20 mins after collecting our luggage for a bus to arrive and transfer us to Vilnius.

### airBaltic customer review
DUB-RIX-TBS and IST-RIX-TXL. Prices to Eastern Europe are usually unbeatable but staff could be more polite. Check-in staff in Riga was outright rude okay in Dublin and Istanbul. Check- in opened very late in Istanbul (1.5 hours prior to departure) which meant a long wait in the rather uncomfortable check-in hall at IST. Overly strict on the check-in weight limit. Cabin cleanliness was okay flight otherwise uneventful.
