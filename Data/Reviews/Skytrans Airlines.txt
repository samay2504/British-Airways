### "6 months later still no refund"
Not Verified |  Our flights were delayed and delayed and then finally cancelled. They expressed we would get a refund and 6 months later still no refund. I called 3 months ago and the woman on the other line expressed that it had been approved and has now gone to the accounts team for action. 3 months later and not a peep. I'm infuriated. Another airline needs to take up this small route gap because the one that does are horrible and unreliable.

### “Absolutely shocking!”
Absolutely shocking! Half an hour before arriving at Proserpine Airport we and others received txts and emails that our flight was cancelled. No explanation the check-in lady at the airport knew nothing of it and had to wait on hold to find out what was going on. We missed our cruise connection and at our own cost had to make our way to Cairns others had to share a rental car don't know what happened to the others. We were offered eventually $125 for accommodation and a refund.

### "experience was very disappointing"
My experience was very disappointing and decidedly expensive. 1. On arriving at the airport we noted that our flight had been significantly delayed, we were never advised prior to arriving. 2. Attempting to check in and make a query I waited at the desk for 15mins whilst the check-in clerk assisted someone else. Then she suddenly disappeared without acknowledging me, even via eye contact - never to return. Someone else arrived finally, over half an hour later. 3. On collecting my near new bag it fell over, a wheel had been completely torn off. Not just the wheel, the component it is attached to, leave a gaping hole in my bag and rendering it useless. I went quickly to the staff counter however again, no staff in sight. I had to manage the rest of my trip with a broken bag. 4. On lodging a claim I was advised that they do not do damaged baggage claims. Damage is considered 'wear and tear' with too many variables that I may have incurred the damage myself. If this is their policy then why even post anything that indicates damage claims can be reported - or as per my phone call to them, why was I advised to email my request for compensation. Quite a joke. Although I presented logical arguments, from my perspective they responded with totally illogical suggestions. The worst being that 'no staff made note of any damage they did' - seriously? My opinion is you seriously reconsider flying with a more customer focused airline.

### "absolutely chaotic from the start"
Stay away from this company, absolutely chaotic from the start. We booked our flight in September 2022 and they changed the rules for baggage allowance from 20kg to 15kg. This was fine when we got to the check-in counter, even though the staff was 20 minutes late. When we got to the gate it was announced it was delayed by 10-15 minutes and after half an hour we could start boarding. When we got to the gate registration we were told that one of our bags had to be taken off since one of your staff "forgot" the rules had changed. Then a lady told as it is what it is. How rude! If we would have been told at the check in we could have repacked so that we had our necessaries.

### "recommend this airline"
Brisbane to Toowoomba, and I was amazed at the service provided by this small regional airline, Skytrans Airlines. Even though the flight, in a small prop-jet, was only 30 minutes duration, we were given bottles of water and packets of potato crisps. Returning the next day, service was equally as good. Would recommend this airline.
