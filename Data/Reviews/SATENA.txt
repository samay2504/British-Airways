### "don't recommend using this airline"
San Andres to Providencia. I don't recommend using this airline. We had to be at midday in Providencia Island and Satena cancelled our flight. They did not gave us any option to be on time for an event that we have. We are 5 people. This was a connecting flight and we had other flights paid, hotels booked and an event organised.

### "excellent choice for domestic travel"
CÃºcuta to Palonegro. SATENA is a Colombian regional carrier that offers good connectivity to remote regions of the country and also serves big cities. Pleasant experience with courteous staff, punctual departure and arrival, well-organised boarding and luggage delivery. The airline has been around for over 50 years but is normally overlooked. It is an excellent choice for domestic travel within Colombia.
