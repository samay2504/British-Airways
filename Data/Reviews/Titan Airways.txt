### "Team were so friendly and welcoming"
Not Verified |  We were on a chartered flight taking a group of very special kids to Lourdes in France. Team were so friendly and welcoming. Lovely comfy accommodation clean and spacious. Lovely touch was a special 'package' snack for our VIPs. Thank you Titan.

### "Seat belt buckles full of grime"
Nice cabin crew, poor food offering. Arms on seats broken. No entertainment screens or radio available. Spent nearly £3000 on holiday and felt like we were given the cheapest flight going. Also window was in a stupid position couldn't look out of it unless you leaned forward. Seat belt buckles full of grime, terrible considering the Covid situation.

### "Many thanks for fetching us home though, Titan"
Not Verified |  Brilliant...a bit shook up to be taken to a plane covered in Jet2 branding. ‘Is this the right one? Are we being kidnapped?’ But the staff were super. The pilot sounded as annoyed as us passengers when he informed us that despite us all getting on board in very good time, we may be delayed by 1h 15m (presumably because other planes due to depart before us being delayed). He must have argued the case very well as we were only 35 minutes late taking off. It was also a 757, rather than a 737 which undoubtedly Jet2 would have used. This meant that once up in the air, it became apparent there was lots of empty rows. Anyone that fancied a kip could get themselves a row and bed down for the flight. Only downside was none of the cabin crew stood in for Jess Glynn and sang ‘Come And Take My Hand’. The end of holiday experience just missed that little touch. Many thanks for fetching us home though, Titan.

### "happily fly again with them"
Not Verified |  I was meant to be flying with Wizz Air back from Athens until we were told it was operated by Titan Airways. However it was a pleasant surprise to climb aboard a Titan aircraft. The staff were extremely professional and incredibly helpful. I would happily fly again with them.

### "they were fabulous"
Not Verified |  Went on holiday in May, flights where changed by TUI so we ended up flying with Titan Airways. I must say they were fabulous, beautiful planes and the staff were friendly and great with my little girl who is 5 years. Would love to fly with them again.

### "struck me as being a professional airline"
Not Verified | Flew 22nd January to Innsbruck - meant to be. There was snow at Innsbruck, we had 2 abortive landings and 2 landings at Munich - 1 to refuel and 2 to be finally diverted there. This was meant to be a 1.5 hour flight, We were in the air for about 6 hours. I am a terrible passenger and did not enjoy the flight one bit. However, the captain, looked after our safety, kept us informed and although I was in a state, they were terrific. The stewardesses were all super friendly and very nice to me when I said how anxious I was. The seats were more spacious than other European flights. Despite the long flight (which was nobody's fault) Titan struck me as being a professional airline, with well trained staff.

### "no hesitation in recommending"
Gatwick to Banjul . Surprisingly comfortable 6 hour journey to The Gambia for Christmas. The cabin was clean, crew were friendly and helpful and the flight was comfortable. I didn't suffer from my skin and eyes drying out as much as with other airlines. I got the feeling they didnt stint on the air quality. The food was fine and typical of airline food. There was plenty of water, juices, tea and coffee and you could buy booze if you wanted. The wines were very nice. Outward on 20 December we flew a Boeing 767 with 2-3-2 seating layout and on return 31 December it was an A320 with 3-3 seating. The seats on the A320 felt more spacious and comfortable although they had no adjustable headrest like the Boeing. We are both tall and it was no hardship. The time passed pretty quickly - perhaps also due to the decent times of the flights and the same time zone both ways. The only negative was the lack of working entertainment - although they have an app for your phone - it didnt work and headphones were not issued. Outward on the Boeing I was able to listen to their radio stations on my seat controls through my own earphones and on return I'd downloaded some movies on my mobile phone . I have no hesitation in recommending Titan Airways who I believe sub contract for other airlines when they are busy. Nothing to worry about - in fact it may be a better experience.

### "have nothing but praise for the cabin crew"
Not Verified |  My sister and I flew from LGW to Banjul. I have nothing but praise for the cabin crew. We flew out on 19th Nov at 8.30. The crew were amazing, we have flown many times and although some passengers were difficult they never wavered from the job in hand and seemed to be happy, genuinely. I wish I took the crews names, as they were on the go the whole 6 hrs.

### "staff friendly and professional"
Not Verified |  Rhodes to Birmingham. We would just like to say a big thank you to all the crew on our aircraft from Rhodes to Birmingham that brought us back on the 29th September due to Thomas cook not trading anymore. The staff was so friendly and professional. Thank you once again .

### "helpful, efficient and courteous"
Not Verified |  Titan Airways flew us back from Mytilene to Manchester (Flight ZT1501) as part of the repatriation after TC collapsed. The flight was excellent, particularly the stewardesses who were helpful, efficient and courteous. The plane was very clean with better leg room than I’ve had before on a typical economy class carrier at anytime in the past, outside of long haul flights. The only gripe I had was the in flight entertainment, it didn’t work even though it said I was connected, I got no connection to it at anytime of trying. This is why it’s only a 9 and not a 10 star review.

### "Extremely professional"
Not Verified |  Kos to Birmingham. Massive thank you to Titan Airways for bringing us home from Kos, not only was it the smoothest flight I have been on but the cabin crew were the best too. Extremely professional. You are all star's.

### "Would like to thank all staff"
Las Palmas to Bristol with Titan Airways. Would like to thank all staff for getting us home at this difficult time due to the collapse of Thomas Cook Airlines. Very helpful, free water and a lovely tea and biscuits after queuing for hours in airport. They were fab, thank you again.

### "very friendly and efficient"
Not Verified |  Zante to Birmingham. Titan Airways were brought in to fly us back from Zante after the collapse of Thomas Cook. They were very friendly and efficient and offered everybody complimentary tea and coffee. They made what could have been a difficult time very relaxing.

### "we had more leg space"
Not Verified |  Stansted to Tenerife. I was booked to fly out with TUI Airways but got a call to say we were now flying with Titan Airways. I wasn't happy, never heard of them. Before we flew downloaded there app and could watch films etc via there wifi, we had more leg space, the plane was clean.

### "hats off to Titan Airways"
Not Verified |  Flew to Banjul with Titian Airways as part of the Gambia experience from Gatwick on the 8th of March. Had a lovely flight, all the staff were lovely. We returned on the 19th of March but unfortunately we had on board a drunken abusive passenger, the cabin crew handled the situation very professionally and even whilst handling a most difficult situation they still treated all the other passengers brilliantly. The service was brill and all in all a brilliant flight, hats off to Titan Airways.

### "Very professional"
Not Verified |  Grenoble to Gatwick with Titan Airways. Clean, new plane - lovely crew. They have a free app with films etc - download before you go. Great - flew with Mark Warner. Very professional - inflight refreshments all good.

### "no choice in flying with Titan"
Gatwick to Alicante. I had no choice in flying with Titan as I booked with easyJet. However, the seat I purchased was not available and I have ended up halfway down the aircraft with no extra leg room and the front toilet is out of order before the flight departs!

### "awful Titan Airways aircraft"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Dubrovnik. Booked BA but got this awful Titan Airways aircraft. Terrible. Very cramped with little legroom. Knees wedged into the back of the seat which is made of a hard plastic. Reminds me of flights from the 1980s. Seat also too short on the backrest so no head support. Worst flight I've been on for years. Certainly would not use them again. Flights were fairly expensive. Budget airline quality for BA prices.

### "fly with Titan again"
Dubrovnik to Gatwick with British Airways operated by Titan Airways. A fantastic flight, a very nice and modern cabin interior with lots of legroom and very friendly crew. Would definitely fly with Titan again!

### "never fly with this airline again"
Paphos to Gatwick. Worst flight I have  been on. Booked British Airways hoping for an adequate service and was subsequently informed that Titan would be fronting the flight. Starting with a two hour delay for boarding, huge queues for the check in (also delayed) and sitting on the tarmac for another 50 minutes in 30 degree heat. The worst aspect of the entire flight was the seat configuration - I have never been on a more cramped flight (including Easyjet and Ryanair). Equally, the plane was old, there barely any storage space in the seat pockets and the seats were uncomfortable. Genuinely would never fly with this airline again.

### "Absolutely dreadful"
Not Verified |  Tenerife to Gatwick. Absolutely dreadful. This was a British Airways flight operated by Titan. The plane was old, the seats were poor (broken due to overuse). The main food choices had run out on the outward flight. The cabin crew worked alone to deliver the catering trolley and didn't have a clue on customer service. They allowed a minor to sit in an exit seat, despite asking his age (13). It just felt all wrong and certainly not what you expect when you buy a BA ticket.

### "Nowhere near as good as BA"
Not Verified |  Flew as part of British Airways booking flying from London Gatwick to Malaga. Head steward great with passengers but a couple of others were rude and officious! Nowhere near as good as British Airways on return journey.

### "uncomfortable seats"
Gatwick to Alicante booked as British Airways and operated by Titan Airways. Horrible service. I had booked through BA so was surprised to see a Titan aircraft. An old aircraft, uncomfortable seats and rude abrupt crew. Definitely do not want another repeat experience.

### "airline has been so inattentive"
On Easter Sunday my family were flying back home from Chambery to Birmingham. We arrived at the airport well in advance of scheduled departure but were rushed through for an early departure, which normally we would be pleased but did not have time for family to eat or drink anything, having to leave hotel early hours. Our family was split up on 3 rows far apart. When it came to ordering food the flight attendants walked briskly past asking on one side but not the other and missed out mum and the 3 children. When mum finally did managed to speak to cabin crew there was no food apart from Pringles and still did not get a drink for one child. We have never been on an airline which has been so inattentive.

### "staff made this flight memorable"
Gatwick to Tenerife. We were cross to find our BA flight had been changed, without notice, to Titan Airways. No proper food service and limited beverages. However the staff made this flight memorable. They were charming, helpful and informative. Despite limited supplies we were kept refreshed and entertained. What could have been a disappointing transfer of carrier proved to be most enjoyable.

### "most cramped flight I've ever been on"
Flew Titan Airways from Arlanda to Rome Fiumicino. Smallest, most cramped flight I've ever been on. Entertainment required an application to be dowloaded before flying, which was not clear before or on the plane. The cabin staff did not inform about this either. The cabin staff was pleasant enough and the pilot ensured a smooth ride.

### "smooth and uneventful"
A very professional outfit. Kept fully informed when flight from Gatwick diverted to Grenoble as a result of security alert at Chambery. Both flights with Titan Airways smooth and uneventful with excellent landings. A welcome change to have pleasant and obliging service from cabin crew and informative announcements from the flight deck.

### "worth every penny"
Fantastic experience with Titan Airways from London Gatwick to Gambia, upgraded to club cabin and worth every penny, excellent food, wonderful crew. This was a Winter charter for The Gambia Experience and it was excellent. The crew could not do enough for you. The check in at Gatwick was not great due to the check in girl needing a lesson in customer service but apart from that could not fault it. We will travel to the Gambia again with Titan Airways.

### "no hesitation flying with them again"
Returning to Gatwick from Genoa after a cruise, and didn't realise that Titan Airways were operating for British Airways until we boarded the flight. Felt a bit nervous having not heard of this operator before. However, after a brief introduction of who Titan Airways were, and details of the flight route and weather conditions, the crew and cabin staff were excellent. This flight on an A320 was one of the best I have been on. No hesitation flying with them again.

### "flight just like they used to be"
Luton to Alicante 9th September. Due to technical problems with Monarch Airlines plane we boarded a replacement A320 operated for Monarch by Titan Airways. A flight just like they used to be. A professional and articulate purser, and other crew members very good too. Most refreshing was that all passengers received a free hot breakfast and beverages, served swiftly. The most enjoyable to Alicante I have taken, courtesy of Titan Airways.
