### "friendly and smiling, helpful"
I recently took four separate flights in Saudia business class after snagging an excellent price which was half the cost of other airlines. Reviews were concerning, but I decided to take a chance. I was disappointed when a schedule change increased my outgoing flight layover from two hours to eleven hours 20 minutes, but I booked the airside Aerotel at Jeddah which worked well. All four flights were excellent, on time and often early. The staff were, without exception, friendly and smiling, helpful, pro-active and responsive. The food was mainly Middle Eastern with a few Western choices, but I eat little during flights, so this didn't bother me. I did appreciate being able to eat at any time rather than fixed dining times. I don't watch inflight entertainment or use the wifi so can't comment on that. The lie flat seat was comfortable although no mattress pad was provided. Neither were pyjamas. I'd certainly book Saudia again if the price was right

### “unbelievable service”
Very bad experience. At first they misplaced my luggage, and in Riyadh they delayed the flight by 8 hours - unbelievable service.

### “far from what was promised”
I recently flew from Dhaka to London with Saudia and upgraded to business class for the Dhaka to Jeddah leg of my journey. Unfortunately, the experience was far from what was promised and turned out to be one of the worst airline experiences I’ve had. Saudia Airlines advertises a dedicated check-in counter for business class passengers, yet at Dhaka airport, the business class counter was  unmanned. Meanwhile, economy passengers were being checked in smoothly. I had to wait 20 minutes, speak to multiple staff members, and go through unnecessary hassle just to complete my check-in. At the boarding gate, there was no separate queue or fast-track service for business class passengers. Everyone was forced into the same long line, waiting over an hour just to board the flight. After passing all the required airport security checks, I was shocked to find Saudia’s own staff conducting additional baggage and body searches at the airplane gate. I was forced to open my carry-on luggage in front of strangers. The flight crew were shockingly unprofessional and rude, they struggled with basic English. The in-flight entertainment system did not work throughout the journey. I paid a significant amount to upgrade to business class, yet I received none of the premium benefits promised. From the chaotic check-in to the lack of priority boarding, unnecessary security checks, and unprofessional service, this was one of the worst flights I have taken.

### "They exceeded my expectations"
I recently flew with Saudia from Beijing Daxing to Riyadh and onward to Istanbul. Before booking, I was quite apprehensive due to the many negative reviews I had read, which mentioned issues such as impolite staff and frequent cancellations. However, my experience was far from those criticisms. From the start, the airline proved to be reliable and professional. Both flights departed and arrived as scheduled, with no delays or complications. The cabin crew were polite, attentive, and made the journey comfortable. Their professionalism and courtesy exceeded my expectations. The only area where I feel Saudi Airlines could improve is in their food service. While adequate, the meal options and quality could be better refined to elevate the passenger experience further. Overall, I take my hat off to Saudi Airlines. They exceeded my expectations and proved the negative reviews wrong. If the need arises, I wouldn’t hesitate to fly with them again.

### "we had to walk a long way"
Booking was easy, but the Saudia website to confirm tickets, seating, and arrange a gluten-free meal was impossible, constantly crashing. The flight out of Manchester went smoothly through security, but then we had to walk a long way down old, worn corridors of the airport to reach the plane. The greeting from Saudia staff was grumpy, and the food was terrible on the return and I ate nothing. Worst of all were the staff—arrogant, rude, and mostly non-existent, with a proper attitude. From Medina to Jeddah, they changed gates at the last minute, and the same thing happened in Jeddah, but it was not a nearby gate; it was on the other side of the airport. Never again will I fly with them - truly dreadful. This flight cost me £980 each, and it was the worst I have ever experienced.

### “Terrible, terrible service”
Most obstructive groundstaff ever encountered. I do not like to give bad reviews. Saudi Airlines has some redeeming features. Lets get the main issue out of the way and then be positive. The two women at the check in desk at Frankfurt were truly appalling beyond belief. First I was told my case was 1kg over the limit, and I had to adjust it and rejoin the queue. I went to another airline to check again with their weight of my case only to find it 0.kg under, keeping me to assume the original weighing was corrupt. Then I was challenged get about my length of stay in Bangkok, and she would not issue a ticket for me until I booked an onward flight, so I quickly booked on on trip.com costing £62 for something I won't use. Explaining that I am sailing from Thailand and returning sone months later cut no ice with this officious lady. Still she was not satisfied and I joined the queue for the third time, which become the fourth when the queue I was in 3rd place suddenly stopped and and I was told to join the one remaining queue demoting me to 30th place. Eventually I got the ticket but was stopped by her equally obstructive colleague at the boarding area. It seems the original lady messed up the onward flight number. Terrible, terrible service that shot my stress level through the roof. So, onto the journey to Riyadh. Plane very clean, staff attentive, never tried the food as I felt unwell from the earlier experiences. Disembarking quick and efficient via bus to the main airport which was very new and clean. Onward flight to Bangkok was pleasant, but still didn't eat, staff very helpful and polite. A request for an extra drink dealt with immediately. In flight entertainment somewhat limited for a westerner, but Internet was available for a fee. Seats on second leg were very comfortable leather (I think) seats. Nice. What a shame those awful women at Frankfurt probly swayed me to not using this airline again. I've given a fair 5 out of 10 for the food after asking a German passenger for his views. Ground service 1/10 but should be minus 500.

### "miss our connecting flight"
Our journey from Amsterdam to Bangkok with a layover in Jeddah turned into an absolute nightmare. Faulty information displayed at Jeddah airport caused us to miss our connecting flight. The ground staff and airport officials were unhelpful, offering no assistance or understanding of the situation. We were sent on a wild goose chase between the Saudia office and baggage handling, receiving conflicting information every step of the way. In the end, we had to purchase new tickets and endure a 10-hour wait for the next flight. To make matters worse, getting a refund for the missed flight has been an ongoing battle for five months. Despite numerous attempts via their website, phone, email, and customer service, we've been met with either excuses or complete silence. This experience was beyond frustrating, and I will never fly with Saudia again!

### “the worst flight I have travelled”
Not Verified | 1) Flight was delayed for more than 4 hours. 2) departure change from 7:30 to 8:20 to 9:20 to 10:20 to 11:45. 3) Departure gate change from A01 to A05 to A04 to A05 to A04. 4) ground staff behaved very badly with me when I asked that I will miss my connecting flight. 5) Due to this delay I miss my connecting flight from Riyadh to Mumbai. 6) Intitally I was told I will get hotel in Riyadh but when I reached Riyadh Airport they asked me to contact Air India. Apparently Saudi Airline booked me with Air India for my connecting flight. 7) At Air India counter I was again asked to run to multiple counters to get boarding pass and nobody was aware of my case. Saudi Airline should have managed this case. 8) Riyadh to Mumbai flight was the worst flight I have travelled in my life. 9) No food, no flight entertainment, broken seat in flight. 10) Finally they lost my baggage and I am still waiting for my baggage.

### "friendly and amazing service"
Checked in, amazing helpful staff, her name was Nikki at London Heathrow Airport, she was friendly and amazing service also told me my flight was delayed which I did not know and made sure everything was okay. Highly recommend

### "progressed from 4/10 to 8/10"
Being a frequent flyer on different airlines, I have witnessed Saudia's progression over the decades. I flew two domestic flights, and this one I am writing about, within 72 hours. Honestly, I used to avoid Saudia, but I think it has progressed from 4 out of 10 to 8 out of 10. The flight was on time, and the flight attendants were attentive. Safety measures were strict and consistent. The price for extra luggage is expensive compared to other airlines. The food quality is better than Qatar Airways but lower than Emirates. The internet service is expensive.

### “lack of accountability and responsiveness”
I am extremely dissatisfied with Saudia’s handling of my claim for delayed baggage, which has remained unanswered for over a month. This disregard for my situation is not only disappointing but also a violation of EU Regulation 261/2004 and the Montreal Treaty, both of which Saudia is obligated to honor. If Saudia can overlook these important regulations, it raises serious concerns about their commitment to customer care. On October 10, 2024, I traveled from Amsterdam to Jeddah to Bangkok, only to discover that both of my checked baggage items were missing upon arrival. I promptly filled out the Property Irregularity Report (PIR) form on-site and received my baggage only after a troubling 72-hour wait. In the interim, as I only had my laptop with me, I was forced to purchase essential items such as clothing and toiletries. I filed a claim for these necessary expenses within the required seven days but have yet to receive any response from Saudia. The only reason I rated Saudia two stars is because of the in-flight staff, who were commendable. However, the lack of accountability and responsiveness regarding baggage services has been completely unacceptable. I expect immediate attention to my claim and a prompt resolution to this matter.

### “totally disrespectful of their customers”
Unethical and immoral practice is their standard approach to business. They held us up until flight departed only to offer new ticket. During this episode I witnessed similar treatment of other travellers. One practice is to over book flights, hold up travellers for some vague obscure reason then charge a rebook fee. I witnessed this whilst waiting. Their staff are insolent. The Customer Relations Manager in Jedda, named Suleman is arrogant and his behaviour is represented in the attitude of his Customer Relations Staff. They are all totally disrespectful of their customers. I purchased new tickets to flee the stress that they caused us and to get home.

### "flight was delayed over 3 hours"
Not Verified | My flight was delayed over 3 hours. It’s not the first time I chose Saudia as a carrier due to the good quality on board service and punctuality. Hence, it disappoints me even more how I was treated as a loyal customer. As soon as I received the information about the delay I knew that I wouldn’t be able to make it to my next flight that was leaving from Paris to Warsaw at 4.20pm. It was the separate booking as unfortunately Saudia doesn’t operate in Poland. I went to the passenger claim office in Jeddah to tell them about my issue and then I was being transferred to some person in the transfer area who told me that the delay is my fault as I don’t have the connecting flight. Then I was transferred again to 2 other places but no one was treating me seriously as a customer. Just to make it clear - due to the delayed over 3 hours flight I had to book another flight. So not only I lost the tickets I’ve already had but also had to buy the new ones in the last moment. I was travelling with my husband. In total we both lost almost 1100 EUR because of Saudia, not mentioning the time and tiredness since we had travelled all the way from Jakarta. Since Saudia is not an EU carrier and the flight departed from non EU country I’m not eligible for the compensation according to the EU regulations. And Saudia seemed very happy about the fact that there is absolutey nothing I can do so that they take some responsibility. They distributed free refreshments to make it up to the passengers. It’s obvious that people have plans and might have booked some other connections later. I always recommended Saudia as a carrier but now I feel only anger and disappointment.

### "never flying Saudi again"
The flight from Lahore to Jeddah was more than 5 hours and the staff was unprofessional. The crew pretty much disappeared after the meal was given and came back 10 minutes before landing. They were actively ignoring passengers' requests. I had to wait hours to get a glass of water. There was no tea served at all on a 5 plus hours flight. I'm never flying Saudi again.

### "appalling service I received"
I am writing to express my profound dissatisfaction with the appalling service I received during my journey on flight SV38 from Dulles International (IAD) to Riyadh (RUH) on 30th September 2024, connecting to flight SV637 to Amman (AMM). Due to external events, flight SV637 made a U-turn and returned to Riyadh one hour into the flight. What followed was a nightmare: I was informed the flight would depart at 21:30, but that flight never happened. Eventually, I was rebooked on flight SV633, which finally departed on 2nd October after nearly 43 hours of delays. During this ordeal, Saudia showed a shocking disregard for passengers, stranded in Terminal 4 with no access to lounges or proper resting facilities. We were kept in the terminal overnight, receiving no assistance. The only provision offered was an inadequate box with a cheese sandwich, a small water bottle, and sugary juice—a gross insult after hours of waiting. Upon arriving in Amman, the misery continued when I discovered my luggage was missing. At the baggage claims office, I was met with the most unprofessional and belligerent employee, devoid of empathy for passengers who had been in transit for over 45 hours. As of today, 3rd October, I still have no information regarding my luggage.

### "not getting any responses"
I lost my checked bag when I flew from Jeddah to LAX on 7 September. I opened a claim upon my arrival at the airport, open another claim online, submitted a complaint online, sent multiple emails, called the US 800 number multiple times and called the international number for Jeddah airport. It has been more than 10 days and I am not getting any responses at all. My bag has an airtag that shows its location at King Abdulazziz international airport terminal 1 yet nobody can locate it.

### "Onboard entertainment didn't work"
Not Verified |  The last time we flew Saudi Arabian Airlines was well over 15 years ago. If memory serves, the cabin crew were a delight, customer service was outstanding, and the planes and onboard entertainment were decent. This time, (August 2024), we flew out of Riyadh (during a transit from an inbound Jeddah flight) to London. Saudi Airline gound crew were non existent. We had to traverse the entire length of the airport, past the baggage claim, before a helpful airport security employee signposted us to circle back to the baggage claim section/building exits, noting the airport bus which we would need to take to get to the Terminal 4 building for our Outbound London flight. All this with my daughter who has mobility issues. We turned back, walked back towards baggage claim, exited the building and found ourselves out in Riyadh. Again, no ground crew to redirect international passengers. We saw one bus, asked the driver and got on board. Shortly, found other passengers joining us. All equally confused, but finding reassurance when we spoke with each other that this was an official airport bus, and it'd be taking us to T4. Once the flight had been announced, we all headed to the boarding gate again, here there was no rhyme or reason, with people rocking up late with bags and shown to the front of the queue, despite our Boarding passes having codes. Once on board the aircraft. My daughter & I were put into separate seats, despite Saudia having forced us earlier to pay for the privilege of seating next to each other, and at the front of the plane. Despite our protests, the cabin crew were not helpful, nor understanding but simply stating to take it up with Saudia ground staff in London. Onboard entertainment didn't work. The screen was non-responsive to touch. The return leg was spent looking at the overhead flight map. Outdated in-flight entertainment equipment.

### "observed poor hospitality"
Travelled with SA recently and observed poor hospitality and no entertainment for kids. I have travelled earlier (2019) and service quality was acceptable. I recommend the SA team to work on improvement of quality services and guests satisfaction. Thank you!

### "No entertainment"
They will take your money but give you an inferior product. Our flight was downgraded from a 787 to an ancient Boeing 777-300ER. No entertainment. Rubbish seats and everything looked so worn.

### “Paid and requested for bassinet”
Not Verified | Paid and requested for bassinet. Bassinet was confirmed upon arrival with the front desk while checkin. However only upon entering the plane did we know that we did not get a bassinet seat and had to hold our 9 months baby for the during of our 8hrs 15 mins flight in a very cramped space. The air hostess who we mentioned our bassinet to kept talking in a very sarcastic and said ‘sorry flight full cannot do anything only one economy seat left on whole flight, please go sit’.

### "call center team has limited to no ability"
Saudia continues to lower the bar in terms of customer service. Their call center team has limited to no ability to support on anything beyond sales and seems unaware of most protocols in place - all they do is refer you to email and website forms to fill that have gotten 0 replies for a couple of months. Every operator has a different perspective and approach (one mentioned email, other web page form, another to go to the airport; the airport team members also had a different perspectives). It seems there are no standard protocols to be followed at Saudia or their staff is unaware of them.

### "will pay more for improved service"
Very poor experience with Saudia Airlines which was well below what you would expect from a national carrier from their home airport. Flight was delayed almost 4 hours and the communication from ground staff was non-existent with no updates or information. Comfort refreshments were also only offered after well over 3 hours and only after customers became angered at the way they had been treated. To make it even worse the template possibly automated responses from their guest relations team online showed a lack of interest in the way they deal with complaints and customer issues. I will not be using again if I have the choice and can think of several competitors I will pay more for the improved service.

### "did not receive her bags"
Not Verified | The worst experience. My mom travelled from Los Angeles to Cairo and she did not receive her bags at Cairo airport (there were many same case) looks like it was a mess. After couple days my mom received the luggage in a disgusting shape. The first bag was first time to be used they broke one of the roller. The second bag they cut the front zipper. Moreover my mom’s medicine was in one of them and got damaged too. I tried to contact the airline. The worst customer service ever seen between the airlines companies. After going back and forth they didn’t fix what they damaged. I used to live in UAE, big WOW to the Etihad and Emirates airlines. Also, Qatar Airways is great, look around and learn. I am reserving another ticket for my mom and told me never to use Saudi airlines again!

### "they have gone backwards"
Not Verified |   I flew Saudia years ago and they were great but they have gone backwards. Checking in at airport - used self check in, got luggage tag, but no boarding pass. Staff member assumed I didn’t know how to use machine and walked me through exactly what I’d done already. Surprise, still no boarding pass. Then had to wait in the long check in queue, having been told that because I booked 6 months ago I would be on the stand by list. At the check in desk, the 2 agents passed my passport back and forth, looking confused and speaking Arabic for ages but wouldn’t tell me what the problem was. Eventually got boarding pass, although departure time had changed and was now later. Plane was hot on boarding and for first part of flight, then got freezing cold. Stopover in Jeddah wasn’t advertised on booking ticket so that was a surprise at the airport. Jeddah is in completely the wrong direction for Manila and added a good 3hrs to the journey. Seatbelt sign was on for majority of the flight despite very little turbulence. 5hrs in I was desperate to pee so I got up but was literally yelled at by cabin crew and not allowed to use toilet. Crew served a small meal and one tiny bottle of water at start of flight and then go sit at the back. I do a fair bit of long haul flying but this was not good, and very surprising given that the hospitality in Saudi Arabia itself is second to none.

### “it didn't feel like business class”
Not Verified | Our flight was delayed without an explanation. We stayed in the plane for an hour without AC in the scorching Riyadh heat. The door was open cause we didn't have an air bridge and we were hauled to the plane by bus earlier and that made the heat on the plane even worse. It took hours for the temperature to finally stabilize after take off when they finally turned the air-conditioning on. The plane felt dated and the seats didn't have power plugs although it's business class. The food on board was okay but overall it didn't feel like business class.

### "I missed my flight"
My original flight time was 3pm however the information on the flight board stated 3.45pm. Based on the board information which I trust would be most recent & accurate as a  was unfortunately wrong. The flight time remained at 3pm to which I missed my flight. The customer service personnel from the airline diffused responsibility and told me it was my mistake and not the airline's mistake. Though they did eventually get me on a new flight, this would be my 1st and last time flying with them.

### "Service onboard impeccable"
Dar Es Salaam to Manchester via Jeddah 30th April 2024. First leg on A320, 2nd on newer Boeing 787-10. Both flights on time, and luggage delivered finely at final destination. Airbridges provided throughout. The trip was the return legs to Europe and was a bargain promotional purchase: paid some 240 Euro which proved extremely good value for money. Preordered (and got) the seats onboard that I wanted without further pay due to status in Flying Blue. Check-in easy and quick, although a bit underwhelming. In Dar airport, Saudia uses the new Twiga lounge in T3, a 3rd party lounge which is nice but with a bit meagre catering compared to other ne lounges in Dar. Hot food was sparse, and only one of six wines, a red Californian, was acceptable. No draught beer. The Jedda lounge is Saudia’s own, Alfursan, which is impressive, top notch with professional baristas and good dining. However, no alcoholic drinks offered, and on the day, they ran out of water for showering. Service onboard impeccable. Good, hot meal services provided every +/- 4 hours interval, more frequent coffee and drink rounds. Amenity kits were given on both legs. They were of very decent quality, nicely decorated in a colourful Arabic them. FAs exhibit extreme courtesy, willing to help if any issue; focusing on passengers’ wellbeing. Amble, large seat space, better than most other airlines in economy. Large toilets, prayer areas and open spaces onboard gives a very ambient “business class” feeling onboard. IFE modern and competitive, including free set of earphones provided. Frequent Flyer and Skyteam Priority perks given throughout, including seatblock if space available. Flyer miles and tier point instated quickly. Very Islamic oriented airline, including prayers at take offs. Alcohol search at boarding; no alcoholic drinks offered apart from Lounge in Dar; but not an issue. Will use them again. The airline impresses me and improves for every trip; service level become more and more consistent and genuine.

### "makes it impossible to claim"
My flight was delayed, I had a few days without my suitcases, I filled out required forms. I have had to buy new things out of my own pocket, this airline makes it impossible to claim back for this, they put every barrier in the way, you literally cannot complain or get hold of anyone, its appalling treatment of people.

### "never use Saudia in future"
Flight SV588, Jeddah-Dubai, 24th April 2024. I came for UMRA with my family and on our departure we faced tremendous difficulty at Jeddah Airport, we were first told to go to gate 27A and later it was changed to A45, by the time we reached to the gate it was 11:35am the person over-there was very cruel and rude, I was requesting him to allow as I am with my family and we were waiting at the gate earlier but he said no go to counter 25 and buy another ticket. On counter 25 there was a lady said you buy online ticket of any airline and we purchased FlyNas ticket and came but when we arrived at DXB Airport we did not receive our baggage. We are really disappointed as we spend extra 3,000 Dirhams buying FLYNAS ticket and our baggage did not arrive. We were having kids and there was one more family with infant and the mother was pregnant and even they suffered a lot, ideally Saudia Airline should have adjusted us in the other flight but they forced us to buy another ticket. We will never use Saudia in future.

### "a very pleasant experience"
Geneva to Jeddah to Dubai + Dubai to Riyadh to Geneva. Honestly, everything was great. If only the European & American carriers had this level of service in Economy. Arabic coffee (+ dates) served as a welcome drink (in Economy!) on the Geneva to Jeddah leg. Crew overall very nice and attentive, aside a couple of Saudi male members on the GVA to JED segment who look very unmotivated. Full hot meals served, even on the Jeddah to Dubai leg (2 hours). Yes, no alcohol available (Saudia is a dry airline) – not a big deal for me. Priority bag delivered first. The only areas of improvement are the IFE (the movie selection is just limited) and the onboard WiFi (packages are non-sense in terms of data, and expensive). The Saudia international lounge in Jeddah is impressive: as a SkyTeam Elite Plus member, I was able to use the Elite section, with a la carte food & drinks (pics attached). Riyadh lounge, on the opposite, very mediocre. Overall, a very pleasant experience: love the Saudia re-branding and quite impressed with the progress they made in the last few years.

### "Seems changing for better"
Saudi hospitality inside cabin. Nice trip with Saudia from CDG to RUH Helpful and carey cabin crew reflecting saudi hospitality Shiny aircraft if you look at details ; IFE takes your time for the whole trip since there is a wide choice. Food not great, especially hot meals in eco class. Good experience. Seems changing for better

### "extremely high value"
Flew Milano to Dar via Jedda 4/4 2024 on A330-343R and A320, respectively. Both flights on time, hardly half full. Purchased as a cheap, promotional, economy ticket, which rendered high and genuine returns. Food, lounges, mileage, service were well provided. Kindness on board was extraordinary and became pleasure throughout. The Ramadan season was on, which resulted in double servings as those fastening could not attend daylight offerings. Then, the trolley has to go again a couple of hours later. Both flights on time, less than half full. Seat choices accommodated free of charge due to my Skyteam Elite status. Information on gate changes sent by email instantly. Lounges were of high quality. Access granted in Montale Lounge in Italy and again in Skyteam Lounge in Jedda. The first is good with tarmac view and booze. The Jedda one lacks this, but has altogether a lot more to offer as the world largest Skyteam lounge. It holds very high standards and options of food and drinks. Separate baristas, food stalls, delicatesse shops, slumber and special areas. Onboard, FAs were throughout kind, observant, accommodating, and like their jobs. They went the extra mile to accommodate passengers wishes. They offered specialities like e.g. fruits rounds, Arabic Coffee rounds with dates, hot towels, and what not. Drinks were only soft, but plenty. IFE world class and functions well, inclusive of headsets provided. Hot meals were plenty and one could ask and get more if so wanted. We were all well fed as I observed. Amble seat distance with some 33-34” distance to next seat in front. Last flight granted me 3 seats in a row, while the first eventually gave me four seats to fully stretch out. Better than many legacy carriers for this night flight. Had double continental breakfast (2 options) before landing. Recommended, extremely high value for the modest fee charged for the trip.

### "such a amazing personality"
Not Verified |   I flew from JFk to COK (India) and flew back COK - JFK ; on April 1st 2024. This flight made me change my mind, met two flight attendants named Sahzia and Salma and they were helpful, they were nice, people were very happy with them in that section, I travel 3-4 times a year in various airlines and haven’t seen such a amazing personality.

### "given them such as great respect"
Not Verified | I’ve taken Saudia from Washington DC to Mecca to do my umrah, and when I returned, it was such a long flight, just wanted to send out a special thanks to Mr. Malik even though it was a long thing. He was extremely polite, extreme courtesy, and a special to my kids my two young daughters he has given them such as great respect. I salute him, such a great person to have on your staff.

### "history of bad customer support"
I had very bad agent chat experience. She ended the chat within 10 seconds of her getting on it. She did not respond to my question or allow me to follow up on her response (which seems to be copy pasted prompt). It appears that she does not know how to read in English as her response had nothing to do with my query. If a live agent chat support is using copy pasted prompts then why are you using an agent at all? Finally, the chat bot when prompted to complain transfers you to the call center which then transfers you to this portal that then tells you to make up travel details to submit a complaint.

### "exceptional cabin crew"
The flight was full, check in and boarding was smooth. What make this flight exceptional is cabin crew. He was humble, welcoming passenger with very positive and real smile. I was carrying small bag with medical logo. He offer me help in any medication I need two times (before departure and before landing) He spend time to teach kid how to work with IFE. He make this flight unique travel experience and i think his behavior tell you how much he loved his job and helping others.

### "Crew did their job well"
I only had a hand-carried luggage so I took advantage of the electronic system at the airport that saved me time. They are now, though, a bit strict with weight on hand-carries. The flight was on-time. Crew did their job well. Food on-board was okay

### "downgraded to Economy class"
Not Verified |  Horrible experience flying with Saudia. On transit in Jeddah, my next flight to KUL was cancelled at last minute and I was put in the next flight to KUL and downgraded to Economy class without any explanation. My written complaint was ignored by Saudia who claimed that they have given me a business seat to KUL.

### “rude, unprofessional and not helpful”
My flight was delayed on 1/12 so then I called to reschedule it for 1/13. My tickets included two free bags. I was charged $650 for 4 bags. The ticket passenger agents were extremely rude, unprofessional and not helpful. Jessica was one of the ticket counters who stated that we had two free bags before she called Elcheikh Shibl over where he told us we didn’t. It seems like the workers there including the supervisor are unprofessional. In the flight, there was a lot of safety violations where a child was sitting in the first row. On the way back on 1/15 I flew back from Jeddah to IAD. I had a layover in Riyadh and the supervisor at the counters in Jeddah refused to speak to us and explain why we had to do customs in Riyadh. We were told we needed to take our bags and check them in again with a two hour layover. The supervisor in Jeddah failed to show us the regulations for where we need to declare customs when we asked for it. She was very rude and uneducated on her position. She treated the customers poorly and people kept complaining about her.

### "Very unprofessional service"
Customer service office in Jeddah Airport was very rude, using mobile phone while serving customer, texting now & then, even did not answer my enquiry. She did not even bother to talk. Only paid attention to social media page in her mobile. I was allow to get 46 kg luggage however they denied it. Very unprofessional service.

### "flight experience was good"
Not Verified |  Ground crew in Jeddah was chaotic. They let a whole flight to Dhaka to cut the check in queue while others had to wait for hours. The flight experience was good on the other hand. Non stop food and drink service. IFE working and has good selection of movies. Seat pitch and quality was acceptable for coach.

### "Missing luggage"
We came from Dhaka to London Gatwick via Jeddah this week, with no luggage. Missing luggage. They are chaotic, with no customer service. They cancel your booking, they don't serve a proper meal.

### “J product felt average as nothing stood out”
On my second leg onwards from Jeddah to Milan, I used the bid for an upgrade feature offered by Saudia and my proposal was successful, hence flew in J class onwards. My first impression of this flight started poorly as it was delayed without any formal explanation for the delay. I was just sent a text message out of the blue saying my flight was delayed full stop. However, since my flight was delayed, it was nice to be able to use the Alfrusan Lounge to pass the 6.5-hour layover. The lounge facilities were quite nice, but one downside was the front desk ladies, who were too busy chatting and a bit aloof to my queries when I sought assistance. When finally onboard, the seats were lie flat and satisfactory for the 5 hours hop. Meals and service onboard were just okay. In summary, my impressions of my experience on this J product felt average as nothing stood out, maybe even slightly below average.

### “flight attendants friendly, attentive and present”
Not Verified | This was an excellent flight and had everything to make the near 14-hour flight go by fast. Meals were good as the catering was done in Seoul as opposed to Jeddah. I’ve found that catering isn’t always the best whenever I fly out of Jeddah. No seat neighbors in economy, so I could do what I coined the ‘Saudia stretch’ in economy across the empty seats. For the first time, my AVOD system didn’t glitch at all, allowing me to watch all my flicks without interruptions, which was heaven. Last but not least, the flight attendants on this leg were friendly, attentive and present with good service and frequent beverage runs. Overall, all the qualities of this trip made for a perfect trip, even while flying on economy.

### "lacking that warmth and personal touch"
Bangkok to Al Ula via Jeddah, and back. On the positive side, I found that Saudia flights were Likely to be less full than their Middle Eastern counterparts, even during peak Xmas season - on the B787, almost every passenger had the middle seat free, and some even had the entire row to themselves. On the A321, everybody had a row to themselves. I also liked the reasonable pricing during this peak holiday season, somehow perhaps I get the feeling that being a profitable airline isn’t exactly a top priority? Little details like Email notifications on gate assignments & when boarding commences helped too. It may seem so insignificant yet it is actually so useful. One last thing that is so easy to overlook, is that despite the mediocre service to be elaborated upon below, they seem to have a decent on-time performance, one of the best in the world. On the negative side, I found to be really annoying the double security checks on inbound flights, frisked and patted down violently for all passengers, regardless of travel class (Business or Economy). I’m sure no other passenger liked that either. The second security check took place at the aerobridge, just before boarding the aircraft. I found other aspects of the Saudia experience to be simply mediocre or neutral. Starting with the legroom (seat pitch), Interestingly enough their older A321CEOs had the most generous amounts of legroom. The newer B787-9s seemed to scale back on the legroom, which in my opinion was sufficient but not generous. It was around the same as most other Skytrax 4-star airlines like Oman Air & Etihad, which for short or mid-haul flights are still acceptable, but would hurt for longer-haul flights. Also average were the IFE and Meal Service. I put them together because they were all satisfactory and sufficient but not luxurious or generous. Last of all, the Cabin Crew attitude was alright, but not great. They’re certainly still lacking that warmth and personal touch which put most Asian Airlines a cut above the rest.

### "Seats were comfortable enough"
Check in was good and guy changed my seat so I was by the window. Seats were comfortable enough for an average economy flight. Pillow blanket provided to Jed-Ams with a small pack with eye mask, socks and dental (toothbrush and paste). Entertainment on my seat didn’t work, they reset it but still wasn’t 100% so just watched from seat next to me as it was free. Lots of kids on flight and they were provided a kit. Movies are older but sufficient for 6 hours. One meal provided and I had no choice as all options gone by they got to me. It was beans which tasted terrible with yoghurt and fruit. I asked for more yogurt and fruit and it was provided but the service is slow and somewhat unfriendly. Was always asked if I wanted juice but I always had to ask for coffee and only creamer and no milk available. Flight was good value considering the cost (250 usd return Saudi to Europe) but next time I’ll bring my own food and if I’m spending more I’d prefer to fly another airline.

### "My luggage wasn’t boarded"
Extremely congested Aeroplane. Pathetic food quality. Ridiculous airport conditions at Jeddah Airport. My luggage wasn’t boarded on my flight from Jeddah to Delhi. Customer support is worst. For everything, you need to contact Main office in Saudi Arabia only.

### "grateful for her professionalism"
Fabulous service from our attendant Janani. She was attentive, gracious and went out of her way to make us comfortable and feel special. We are grateful for her professionalism and her incredibly positive and helpful manner. Highly recommend.

### "now they don't want to refund"
One of the worst ground staff ever. They rejected my sister (flying with my elderly mum and dad, under the same booking reference) from Cairo to Jeddah to perform Umrah, because as per their staff she couldn't fly on my sponsored visa issued by MoFA (as all of them were). My parents took the flight unaccompanied and I booked for my sister a new flight with layover in Riyadh with a different airline and this time she was accepted. But now they don't want to refund the Cairo-Jeddah business class ticket because "she didn't show up" as per the customer service. I did a complaint and they responded with the same answer that my sister was a no-show, how come if she's the one accompanying my elderly parents with the additional Altanfeethi vip service.

### “staff was rude, unprofessional and cheap”
I had an extremely bad experience with Saudi Airlines two days before when coming from Jeddah to Lahore. I arrived 5 hours before the flight time, but there was a long queue of passengers for check in, on asking it was revealed that check in is open for all people together going to Bombay, Islamabad and Lahore on the same counters, no separate counter for each flight. After waiting for almost 2 hours in the queue when it was my turn their supervisor announced that they will first take Bombay passengers as their flight time is close and I was put on hold, after waiting another 30 minutes they again hold me and said they will first check in Islamabad passengers now as Islamabad flight time is early, after waiting another 30 minutes when finally it came my turn then they simply denied to check in for Lahore saying the flight is full! I had a confirmed ticket bought one month before but then denied me even though there were 2 hours still before flight departure. The attitude of staff was rude, unprofessional and cheap third class. I went to their office and their manager said it is allowed for them to overbook and now you will be transferred to the next available flight which was 13 hours after my original flight. It was really frustrating that even though I had a confirmed ticket and check-in was still open still about 15 people were denied to check in with rude behavior and reason being flight over booked. Later on I found that people going to Islamabad and Karachi were facing the same issue. Extremely bad policies of Saudi Airlines and bad practice by them, it means there is no guarantee of a confirmed booked ticket even if you arrive hours before check in? Will never travel with them again, such a bad airline.

### “Really good flight”
Really good flight, on time with nice meal served for an only 2 hour flight. Only negative was the somewhat chaotic boarding process. They list zones on the boarding passes, but never use them in practice boarding. Would use again.

### "It was a great experience"
It was a great experience. Food was really delicious. The flight was 6 hr, and they serve first coffee or tea then, main-meal and it was good about the taste and quantity, then coffee or tea again, then small meal, and you can ask for more.

### "largest SkyTeam lounge worldwide"
Travelled KWI-JED-BKK-RUH 26-27 October 2023 for the sole purpose of retaining my dear Gold Card with Air France. Aircrafts were A320-Neo and B787s, respectively. Could not check-in online; only for the last of the 3 legs, but that would be disallowed anyway as the sequence of travel legs must be adhered to. Thus, I became worried as I came to Kuwait from abroad for positioning to start the travel correctly. After some search I found the right transfer desk and got full cooperation but they could still not check me fully in but they rendered me lounge access until the travel became “unlocked”. Four hours prior to departure, a Saudia officer came. After some clarification from my side, he eventually produced all my 3 boarding passes; easing my mind and my onward logistics. By having the BPs I would be able to stay airside throughout travel. I was neither asked for passport again, neither in Kuwait, Jeddah, or Bangkok. I love the ease, freedom, as the BPs does the entire job. Kuwait airport can be a challenge for a first time visitor and Westerner. It is old, small and very Arabic, took some time to get orientation for transit. Few speak English, and they lack non-Arab exposure. The arrivals and the departures are not separated and there are potential security issues. Throughout my three Saudia travels there was no premium towards priority passengers whether business travellers or elite card holders. Except for lounge access. Dasman Lounge in Kuwait (KWI) has interesting exotic (Arab) food offerings. And, loads of soft drinks. Dry as a biscuit (no alcohol). Half of the guests are in the smoking room. Cigarettes must be cheap, nobody smokes their sticks beyond half before throwing them as butts. Onboard to JED, on the A320, the configuration was 2 x 2 in business, while 3 x 3 in economy. Huge seats, IFE, and advanced headset was available. The crew were good, attentive. Welcome drink were lemon mint juice. Thereafter, we had saffron yellow hot tea, which is a local delicatesse. After an early breakfast (Arabian choices), I had some sleep in the recliner. Flight on time. Al Fursan lounge in Jedda must be a Mecca for lounge goers: it is the largest SkyTeam lounge worldwide. A first class section provides even a cigar room and a date bar. Slumber rooms, cafes, authentic Arabic food stations, sports room, restaurants. Also, a piano podium is at disposition. Next flight JED-BKK on a newer B787-10. Bus gating, but quite quick. Nice cabin and chair. Even it was a window seat I could hardly reach near to it to view as the distance in the skewed seats is excessive. Safety belts are like car belts, which prevents the body from being torn apart in events of crashes. Nice touch. I saw cabin crew praying on the floor during travel; it makes me uncomfortable and I see it as a disciplinary issue. Welcome drinks offered. Menu cards. Dishes hard to understand for non-Arabs without supportive pictures. In Bangkok, Saudia uses the quite ordinary, 3rd party Miracle Lounge for its business passengers. However, this is a conflict of interests as Miracle refuses acceptance of Saudia visitors until 3 hours before departure. Not acceptable. Me, as a Flying Blue gold card holder I could access the AF/KLM SkyTeam lounge with ease some 17 hours prior to departure. The front desk told me that they refer Saudia Business travellers to the poorer Miracle lounges. Thus, FB status overtrumps cabin class assignment; new lesson to be learnt. The SkyLounge is good and has improved a bit; nice showers, piano background music, sparkling wines and more food options than earlier. However, a bar, bartender, and a noodle station is still needed for it to cope with the three leading lounges in BKK which are SQ, QR, and CX. Flight from Bangkok to Riyadh went smooth, though no WiFi onboard. At boarding, me and my hand-luggage was searched for possibly carrying any alcoholic drinks. I had a few, but they somehow passed. The anti-alcohol policy is more policed than for other dry carriers, e.g. PIA or Egypt Air. In Riyadh I was humiliated to pay 150 USD for transit visa, which was perceived as robbery; I had my onwards flight clearly sorted out but was forced to pay. The verdict is very bumpy and mixed. I do like SVs pragmatic approach and their IT system works despite a few hiccups on inability to print out initial BP, while the subsequent have no issues. Flew on time all 3 flights. Given my earned mileage instantly after each leg accomplished. The membership to Skyteam is an invaluable asset and creates more international and ecumenical exposure to the airline and their staff, which is necessary for any expansion. A recurrent issue with SV appears (from 150 reviews read) to be missing or delayed checked luggage which leaves an angry mob behind and taints the company.

### "tried changing our meals to vegan at check in"
Not Verified |  My wife, daughter (3 years old), and myself are all vegan. This airline was the least accommodating to our dietary needs than any other airline I ever flew and we fly often! I tried multiple times to contact the airline via phone (more than a month before our flight) and in person to change our meals to vegan options. I arrived at the airport 5 hours before our departure time. I tried changing our meals to vegan at check in. They informed me I had to change it at the gate. Once I arrived at the gate they told me I had to change it at check in. I was resigned to the idea that this first half of my flight would not include a vegan option for my family and I. So I thought maybe I could get a vegan meal on our connecting flight to Dubai. The man at the gate informed me that it was possible to change meals 24 hours before the flight but could not provide a number, person, or website to use to change it. I write this review so that this issue can be corrected and also to warn families who are vegetarian or vegan.

### "Seat was very good and comfortable"
Checking in: checked in online and drop luggage procedure in KUL was good. Ground staff was polite and efficient and voluntarily informed me that I can use Golden Lounge in KLIA Satellite. Flight: Satisfactory boarding procedure. Seat was very good and comfortable (reverse herringbone 1-2-1 config). All window seats have good/unobstructed access to at least one of the windows. Flight Attendants: attentive and helpful. Able to communicate in English well during the formalities. However when you try to converse casually, there seems to be some lack of English proficiency. Food: limited choice, Presentation is satisfactory. Satisfactory taste wise. Asked for some refreshments later during the flight but it was out already out of stock. Flight onboard entertainment: Good selection. A little tricky in using the hand-held control though. Headphone is satisfactory in quality. Luggage: rather efficient. Premium bags came out first as it should with short waiting time.

### "Flight Attendants: Polite and efficient"
Check In: checked in online and printed ticket on self-service kiosk in MED airport. Luggage drop is OK. Staff showed couldn't be bothered attitude (I think this is more cultural as ground staff in KUL were totally polite and helpful). No information about the use of lounge was given. Boarding: satisfactory. The flight overall is sufficiently good. Seat is comfortable. Flight Attendants: Polite and efficient. Good English for both formal chores as well as casual conversations. Attentive. Meal: Satisfactory. Presentation is good. Selection is limited. In Flight Entertainment: Good selection. Satisfactory head-phone quality.

### "o idea about customer care"
Saudi Airlines staff who are working in Kuala Lumpur International Airport  (who are in the last check in gate) are the worst staff I have ever seen. They are tough and has no idea about customer care services! They took one of my hand bags which has boarding label, and was threatening me that they will cancel my flight and load off my luggage from the aeroplane. Wen I told them my kid will come and take it from the airport, they said they will throw it in trash.

### "never use or recommend this company"
Dropping the bag took 15min, we got on the plane as expected in time. After about 30min we were told of technical problem needed fixing. After another 30min we asked to leave the plane and wait at the gate for more than 2 hours. The 4-5 Saudia staff shared no information, we were served a box of water,  After another hours we were asked to go out and collect our bags before going to a hotel - there was no information of where to collect the bags and to which hotel. This was another 2 hours almost when the bags arrived. I managed to find a bus that took me to the hotel. So far no information about a replacement flight time or day. I’ll never use or recommend this company.

### "worst thing about this flight was the food"
Not Verified |  I flew from London Heathrow on a very clean 787 with good food, good working video screen and had a row all to myself. Changed at Jeddah for a gruelling 10 hour flight to Jeddah. The plane was an old 777, absolutely jam packed with passengers, the seat back videos didn't work, instead were told to use our smartphones to login to the onboard WiFi for entertainment programmes. The signal kept going on and off. Complete waste of time. The worst thing about this long flight was the food. Tasteless and small quantities. Whereas other airlines leave a basket of snacks and drinks in the galleys, not this one. You had to ask for something. The return a few weeks later from Jakarta to Jeddah was exactly the same. Why does this airline treat it's customers on this route like cattle? These are all humble paying passengers. Why are they so stingy on this route. I was very disappointed especially as the Jeddah London route was so good. Goes to show they can provide quality if they want to.

### "Lack of communication"
I have never had such a horrible feeling experience and after covid that's saying something. This such a horrible airline, from the staff at the airport to their customer service call centre. Lack of communication, service delay, even though we explained my mom was feeling unwell and we needed to know if could fly the next day instead since there was a 4 and half hour delay at Gatwick! The airline was extremely unhelpful, apparently unable to book us into the flight the next day, my mom ended up hospitalised on arrival to Saudi. On the return, I tried to flag down someone, got assistance as my mom wasn't feeling well, they did not know how to contact DR for medical advice, after 15 minutes they figured out who to call but there was no answer. I have no words for any of these people, simply shock and inhumane.

### "Saudia is a hit or miss"
Flight on the 22nd of September 2023. Flight SV871 Manila to Jeddah. Seat 4A, Business class. I was first very excited as the plane was the one equipped with a much recent Business class cabin in 1-2-1 configuration, compared to the 2-2-2 that served Manila for a long time. But the experience quckly turn bad. Not any menu was available, one of the crew was telling us what was available. She arrived to my seat, and told me "you want to eat? So we have light snack, and start reading few names of snacks" I chose the arabic Mezze. But wait?? There is even no proper dinner? Last month on the same flight I had an amazing food experience. After the Mezze, they came and remove all my things, then I asked "there is no dessert or something else? She will come back later she say.. I did got a cheesecake. My neighbor was also complaining, he asked for a second service of mezze. Fee hours of sleeps, less than expected due to this very long service. I wake-up 1h30 before landing and asked to eat. I explained that I want breakfast, and I didn’t yet ask for one. She say ok and again as there are no menu told me what was available. Saudia is a hit or miss, sometimes it is very good, but this was a disaster.

### "no apology or compensation"
Booked for 3 passengers with 6 luggage. Received only one on 14 September 2023. Complained at Gatwick Airport regarding the missing luggage. Received 3 luggage on 18 September 2023, and still 2 missing. No phone or email from the airlines for the missing luggage and no apology or compensation for the service.

### "experience has left me deeply disappointed"
I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the recent experience I had while traveling with Saudi Airlines. My booking reference number is and I was scheduled to fly on flight from London to Dhaka via Jeddah. Regrettably, my journey was marred by a significant delay, which caused me immense inconvenience and distress. This delay was especially distressing as I was traveling under extremely challenging circumstances. I had to make an urgent trip due to the passing of my mother, and the delay exacerbated the already difficult situation. Not only was the delay disruptive to my travel plans, but it also resulted in missed connections and additional expenses. I had to incur unexpected costs for accommodation and transportation due to the airline's failure to adhere to the scheduled departure time. I believe that such a significant delay is unacceptable and reflects poorly on the airline's commitment to customer satisfaction. I had chosen Saudi Airlines with the expectation of reliable and timely service, but this experience has left me deeply disappointed.

### "suitcase never showed"
We were delayed in Frankfurt, sitting on the tarmac for 1.5 h with late and short explanation by the captain “problem with luggage + Frankfurt couldn´t offer a free slot for take off" same adventure on my way back, 3/4 h before we got out of the plane for reasons unknown, suitcase never showed on the carousel. For me it was the first time where passengers stand up before the plane got to it´s gate or the seat belt sign being switched off. They seem unable to force this issue on their own folk.

### "Greetings of thanks, appreciation"
Not Verified |  Greetings of thanks, appreciation and respect to the Tunisian flight attendant, Marwa Al-Buraiki, the Turkish flight attendant, Gulcin, and both the Saudi host, Samer and Khaled, for their good treatment, high morals, and taste with us and with all the passengers on board the Nice-Riyadh flight on 08/18/2023. Frankly, it was a good trip with them. Five-star service. Thank you again to Saudi Airlines for choosing such wonderful people who make the traveler feel like he is with his family. السلام علورحموبركات ، تحية شكر وتقدير واحترام لكل من المضيفة التونسية مروى البريكي والمضيفة التركية جولسين وكل من المضيف سامر وخالد السعوديان على حسن تعاملهم وعلى اخلاقهم الراقية وذوقهم معنا ومع كل الركاب على متن الطائرة رحلة نيس-الرياض بتاريخ18/08/2023 صراحة كانت رحلة طيبة معهم خدمة خمسة نجوم  شكرا مرة ثانية للخطوط السعودية على حسن اختيارها لمثل هالاشخاص الرائعين الذين يجعلون المسافر يشعر كانه مع اهله لكم مكلالامتنانمروىجولسين خالد سامر

### "stewardesses were absolutely rude"
This is the worst airline experience I ever had. The stewardesses were rude to me. Never received a blanket or headphones. A glass of water took ages for them to bring. This only happened after asking them multiple times. The restrooms were wet and dirty. They didn’t put any effort on keeping them tidy. During the meal service, they never provided me the options between the different choices. Just served the meal. Long story short, never again!

### "crew on both flights were friendly"
This was the first time, I flew with Saudia. The crew on both flights were friendly, the plane on the first flight looked pretty new (B787) and looked great on the inside, clean and new. The second plane, a B777-300, looked worn inside, dirty carpet, the entertainment system didn't work. But again, the crew was friendly and a great service. Wi-fi on the first flight, was ok, on second flight, there was no wi-fi. So, it was a bit if a disappointment for a gulf based carrier.

### "flight was cancelled on the day"
Not Verified | The flight was cancelled on the day which was stressful but can’t be helped. I was put in a hotel but not told what time to come the next morning to figure things out. I came back early and waited in a queue. I understand this all can’t be helped and they did sort out my journey as best the could. I was told because it was cancelled so late on the day and it was a long journey I would be entitled to 520£ compensation and to apply via the website. It is now August 2023, I have filled out at least 15 forms of which some were replied too. I received multiple discharge forms stating that I would be compensated if I fill it in and send it back. I’ve done this so many times and now been compensated. I have had numerous phone calls to which they say they, they will send a reminder to the compensation department.

### "Saudia does the job"
I had two legs on my recent flight with Saudia. One from Incheon to Jeddah and the next from Jeddah to Paris Charles De Gaulle. The flights weren’t particularly bad but similarly not noteworthy. As it was a full flight, check-in took a bit of time. The meals were passable and did the job. I made a special low fat meal request and was satisfied with what was offered on both legs of my flight. Flight attendants were friendly and carried out their duties, but lacked a certain service finesse which I would analogize to a well-intended niece helping at the dinner table as opposed to professional cabin crew. My biggest gripe of Saudia has to do with the lack of functionality of their inflight entertainment system as it glitches ALL the time. I have flown with them close to a half dozen times and every time I fly them there is an issue. I am happy with their offerings except that the programs either abruptly ends and return to the default screen or the entire planes IFE needs to reboot since half of the devices aren’t operational. Overall, Saudia does the job, but without any high notes. I got there on time as did my bag.

### "my luggage didn't arrive"
I travelled on 27 July 2023, and when I reached in London I got the bad news that my luggage didn't arrive. From that day i am trying to getting help from Saudi Arabian Airlines but not getting any response.

### "Overall a good experience"
Overall a good experience with Saudia, while the flights were on time, the service of the staff was pretty much okay and the online check-in procedures good too. The inflight entertainment can be improved, even as the food onboard. A remark on the flight was the low level of spoken English of the crew. The plane itself was quite spacious but not always clean.

### "customer service is the worst"
I had booked a flexible business class ticket with them back in March. I am waiting for a refund from that flight that I have cancelled in March up to this day. I spend over 80 euros on calls with the costumers service, spend hours and hours on end trying to reach them via email, calls on many different numbers and their WhatsApp number. I kept being pushed to other departments and other emails for my request. To even cancel took me 2 full days of calling and writing to them. The customer service is the worst I have ever experienced.

### "same snack offered on both flights"
Not Verified |  Old aircraft. No meal served and only same snack offered on both flights which was not filling as we were returning from hajj and were very tired and hungry. No headphone was provided in one of the aircraft on route MED-RUH were screen was working. In another aircraft RUH-DXB screen was not available. No WiFi available. No Inflight entertainment.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
First time I flew out on Saudi Arabian airlines from Manchester to Jeddah. I really enjoyed my flight it was excellent. The airplane was very spacious, very clean I was impressed. Atmosphere was great, cabin crew very helpful and polite, food provided 2 meals were very tasty. I really enjoyed the hot meals, service was great, overall I give a 10/10 service. Second journey was from Jeddah to Islamabad the plane was to small, no tv entertainment, the meal provided was horrible, but the cabin crew Mohammad and Rawal were great.

### "cheerful and willing to serve"
I really like Saudia. My 20th flight with them in 6 months, all without exception were on time, crew always cheerful and willing to serve and a really nice lounge in Jeddah.

### "My baggage were delayed"
My baggage were delayed/lost and I completed a form at the airport but they did not even give me a copy or some kind of a ticket. They said they will contact me and also wrote a phone number to contact but nobody was answering. I called the 800 number but they are also of no help. Their customer care is simply useless.

### "very disappointed in this company"
On 5 May 2023 I had a flight together with my father in law and girlfriend. We arrived at the airport in Amsterdam and went to the gate. 15 minutes before boarding they canceled our flight due to technical issues. There was no one from Saudi airlines to support us. They did not pick up their phone and the staff of the airport could only forward us to Saudi Airlines. I tried 4 different numbers and nobody answered. Then we saw that they automatically without confirming or asking send us new flight details via their an app. This flight departed 2 days later. Because we had not much time in Indonesia and already booked national flights in Indonesia and hotels this was not an option for us. We canceled the flights from Saudia and booked another one from Turkish airlines. Saudia refuse to pay for our financial extra costs. We are very disappointed in this company and I don’t recommend to fly with them. Be warned people. Never again with this company.

### "will recommend them"
Individual experiences and preferences can vary, but for me Saudi Arabian Airlines are really trying in terms of customer service, inflight care. Seat spacing for me it's the best. I'll rate them high and will recommend them to anyone flying their route.

### "love their seats"
Saudia has terrific aircraft. I love their seats in terms of the comfort and seat pitch. Then, they have a dedicated prayer area in the plane too. The food didn't impress me – the menu didn't have any option and served fish. They didn't have baby food either. Also, their website has lot of errors. Despite all this, I would recommend them.

### "working hard to improve their image"
Flights on time. Cabin Crew is very attentive. I was lucky to fly back with same crew who keep same standard of care. They walk around and very initiative. The Cabin was clean although the aircraft was 14 years old. WiFi was acceptable, however not working on return flight. You see how people on this airline working hard to improve their image. Food was above standard.

### "I would fly with them again"
Booked this airline as it was the cheapest return flight to Bangkok, went to drop luggage off as already checked in online, went to business class counter and told her i had already checked and she soon changed her attitude. Lounge was okay, nothing too excited. The on board chef introduced himself and came round with arabic coffee and dates, which i found to be a nice way to start the flight,. The seats were private and i slept well throughout. 1st leg crew was very attentive and smiling, dine on demand did not have my choice of desert. 2nd leg - crew was a bit reserved, i was still full from the previous flight, asked if i could just have the arabic mezze and fruit, she seemed shocked & surprised, later asked for a tea, she did not seem friendly but robotic. 3rd leg crew was pleasant, nothing to comment about. 4th leg -crew was pleasant, ordered pancakes for breakfast with fruit yoghurt, asked if i could have a bowl of fresh fruit as well, but she said i can only have one or the other, strange considering it was dine on demand and you could have what ever you want and at anytime you want. I found the entertainment system to be minimal, not offering much for the western traveller on film choices, the rest rooms were not up to standard and maintained, it was wet and paper was on the floor at times. I would describe the lounge as being quite basic considering it is a new airport, staff were okay & pleasant enough, nothing to write home about. The shower facility was good especially with rainfall showers. This airline is trying to compete with the big 3 - Emirates, Qatar and Etihad, they have a lot to do to be of the same standard especially with the crew and on board services. I would fly with them again only because of their competitive price.

### "Extremely poor customer service"
Extremely poor customer service. I have to use Saudi Airlines out of necessity rather than by choice due to the location of my work and their monopoly on the internal Saudi flights. As I will be travelling by flight frequently, I decided to join the Al Fursan Loyalty Program. This took 2 months to happen as the process could never be completed and seeking assitance from the customer service was futile. By this time I had already flown 3 segments and now wish to add those flights to my account as is permissible up to 6 months post travel. 3 months later I am still trying to add these flights without success. By telephone I am advised to use the WhatsApp service, the WhatsApp service doesn't respond or gives error messages, I have tried sending emails, I have tried submitting a complaint via the website no response from any effort. I have sought assistance from the ground staff as well as the flight staff encountered during my travels however the advice is always to contact the Unified Customer Service number or the WhatsApp service neither of which ever works. Very frustrating!

### "crew were very attentive, courteous"
Not Verified |  My flight was SV571 that was actually quite a decent one. Going to Jeddah for the weekend to watch the F1 Races taking place on March 18. Check in went alright. There was not much inflight entertainment available on the plane was alright but I consider it as average. My meal was really tasty which was a cheese pizza type of pastry served with Apple Juice as well. The crew were very attentive, courteous, and spoke English very well to all of the passengers. I would recommend Saudia for travels in the Middle East as it is one of the cheapest fares for flights and for travels. The only hassle was the ground staff in Jeddah. The immigration lines were horrendous and needed some improvements. I know Jeddah Airport is quite big and could easily get crowded especially when you arrive at 7:00pm. The interesting part of Jeddah Airport was it had lots of food and beverages outlets available in the arrivals corridor.

### "Worst customer service experience"
Worst customer service experience I ever had. I tried for several days to change my flight (I booked a flexible ticket) which was impossible. I couldn’t do it online so I called several numbers and all of them didn’t know how to help me or gave me other numbers that didn’t work at all. I spend lots of money and time on the international calls and no one could help me. The after sales service  told me to use the Whatsapp number, the WhatsApp number told me to call the After Sales Service. I will now cancel my flight and never ever use this airline again.

### "business class was an unpleasant experience"
Traveling business class was an unpleasant experience, worst business even worse than American Airlines; For the price you pay for this business class there are other airlines that offer you much more services both on board and on the ground; wi-fi on board impossible to activate although Saudia provides you with a code via SMS, it does not work, and the staff on board does not know how to help you. Viaggiare in business class è stata un’esperienza sgradevole, la peggiore business anche peggio di American Airlines; Per il prezzo che si paga per questa business class ci sono altre compagnie aeree che ti offrono molti più servizi sia a bordo che a terra; wi-fi a bordo impossibile attivarlo sebbene Saudia ti fornisce via SMS un codice, non funziona, ed il personale a bordo non sa come aiutarti

### "baggage service is very poor"
The crew were lovely but the baggage service is very poor. We were offered to check in our cabin luggage, which we were grateful but until now, 7 weeks later, still not delivered/arrived/missing, other luggage were late delivered and still waiting for 3 more! Do not be deceived with more kg luggage that you can bring! It will not comeback to you and worst no communication from Saudi Airlines despite of our thousand e-mails and calls!

### "Jeddah was chaotic and slow"
I did fly with Saudia for the first time. It was on the route between MAN - JED - MNL and I was returning 3 weeks after. The aircraft and the cabin crew - no concerns. Food and beverages were good but during the 11+ hours second leg only 2 meals were served. Interchange in Jeddah - the airport has no drinking water, unless you buy in one of the very expensive shops there. The airport has a very few toilets for males but plenty for females (not sure why). The interchange/transit in Jeddah was chaotic and slow. There was no clear signs where to go and there was not enough staff to guide passengers. During the flights passengers were praying on the plane, on the floor. One thing is certain. I have learnt the Arabic prayers by heart as they were playing it on multiple occasions before and after the take off.

### "Difficult experience"
Not Verified | 90 percent of tv screen not working. Food comes in small tray. Food quality poor. Seat uncomfortable. Staff nice though but limited snacks available. Difficult experience

### "spacious seats and good service"
I was impressed with how good the planes were, spacious seats, and good service. The only thing I didn't like much was the food. The problem with Saudia is the ground services and check-in services at the airport in Jeddah which is very slow and quite chaotic.

### "Disappointed with lack of hospitality"
Not Verified |  
Disappointed with the lack of hospitality. Very limited food/meals offered. Food offered was only breakfast not even main meals. I always travel with Emirates and Emirates meals are delicious and actual proper food!

### "staff was simply unpleasant"
The air hostesses were extremely rude and unprofessional, with a lot of bad attitude. Asked for water 4 times with 3 hours of flight time remaining and never got it. The staff was simply unpleasant.

### "Customer service is the worst"
Not Verified | Worst airline ever to travel. Customer service is the worst. They will lose bags even your connection is more the 4 hr. They will still not upload your bags in connecting flight I was flying from Pakistan to Los Angeles and I arrived on Feb 13,2023 but its Feb 16, 2023 haven't received it yet. I called customer service with no answer at all and all the number they provided are off or no answer.

### "reviving and comfortable"
New York to Riyadh in Business Class. I’d like to thank Mr Tarig for making my first trip with an infant as comfortable as it was. Mr Tarig was very respectable and humble. He kept checking up on us and made it so effortless for me, my baby, and my mother. Not only was he professional but also exceptionally polite and understanding. Thank you very much for making this trip as reviving, and comfortable as it was for us.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
I am writing to you to express my great dissatisfaction with my recent experience with Saudi Airlines. January 3rd flew Saudia from Washington DC to Lahore via Jeddah and encountered terrible service. I lost my Hand-carry which they took away at time of getting into the plane. The service I received from the airline staff was unprofessional, rude, and slow. My flight was delayed for 19 hours at Jeddah airport, and when I asked the staff for an explanation, they were unable to provide one. I found the staff attitude towards customers to be unhelpful and dismissive. Worse yet, when my flight finally arrived, my hand-carry was nowhere to be found. I had to purchase new clothes, toiletries, and other items in order to make it through the rest of my trip. I had to pay for these items out of my own pocket. I was also disappointed in the customer service I received when I reported the lost baggage. The staff was unhelpful and unsympathetic, and it was clear that they did not take my complaint seriously. They refused to give me a claim number by saying that it was not needed. I have tried to contact the airline both by phone and email, but I have not yet been able to speak to any customer service representatives who can provide me with information regarding my hand-carry. They hung-up the phone on me when I asked for some help. I have now been without my luggage for over three weeks and have yet to receive any response from the airline.

### "Entertainment screens were not working"
Ordeal started at the airport after security clearing. Flight was little late, wanted to go to the washroom but the lady said - can't go. I've to wait, board the plane and then use the washroom inside the plane. Entertainment screens were not working. Wi-Fi was not working. Though they have mentioned on their website, they provide Bellini as signature drink, but it was not given. Menu on the screens were not showing up, there should have been proper menu card for the Business class. On Main course Meal, I ordered fresh fruits as desserts but have been told that all the fruits are over and there are no more fruits. I mean, this is ridiculous. Slippers were not provided. For the whole Business class section, there was one tiny washroom, in which a tall person like me can hardly fit in.

### "finally got my bag after 9 days"
My baggage was lost. I tried calling for three days with no one answering the phones. I do not believe that your customer should have to keep calling to find out where their lost luggage is and when it will be delivered to them. That should be the company’s priority. However, nobody called me or seemed to care about my lost baggage except for me. I finally got my bag after 9 days. I arrived for a two week stay in India. That is not acceptable service. I had no clothes or my medication for 9 straight days. I had no jacket or sweater for warmth at night. My entire 2-week trip was ruined because of the stress and loss I suffered waiting for my bag and not receiving any communication from anyone at Saudia about it.

### "came with one luggage 27kg"
We made flight bookings from Kochi to Riyadh. We made sure we (two of us) booked a "Semi Flex" booking so that we would have the privilege to fit in our luggage - 23kg x 2 per passenger and we got the confirmation saying the "Semi Flex" booking has been made. However, when we tried to do a web check-in,  it said 2 x 23 kg came with one luggage 27kg. On call we have only been asked to write an email to customer services. We have emailed them several times since 13/01 and have also tried to follow up on call. But we have been only asked to send emails to different email addresses. Staff is friendly. No space for the legs and very old plane think twice before you book a flight!

### "offered terrible customer service"
I am a member of the loyalty programme of Saudia I had 3kgs extra in an exercise mat that could not be taken as hand luggage. I understand that rules are rules, however I was told that the issue was not the excessive weight. I then suggested wrapping the mat with my main check in luggage and was told that this was not allowed. I told them that I had done this with Saudia recently, the staff involved were unable to show me where it says that this was not allowed. The ground staff let the airline down and I ended up paying excessively without being told the reason. Was it that my ticket allowed only one piece of luggage? Why could I not carry some weight on my backpack if this would mean being charged less. The staff were absolutely unhelpful and offered terrible customer service. As passengers we deserve to have things explained to us. I will not be in a hurry to fly Saudi from London Heathrow anytime soon.

### "great full service airline"
I spent a span of 21 hours flying Saudia across three regions of the world in economy and satisfied with my experience in the whole. To start, the pros to flying Saudia was the price, seating and it's incredible staff. My flight was extremely affordable relative to competitors and the seats were fantastic due to having a lot of empty seats around. Additionally, inflight crew were  friendly and took initiative in the most authentic way. I felt well looked after in the most genuine way! As for my cons, they dealt with the lack of cleanliness, catering and online infrastructure. My seat from Geneva and to a lesser extent out of Jeddah to Seoul wasn't the cleanest. One of my flights had residual trash in the seat pocket and a lot of dirt was wiped off using a wet towel. Moreover, I get that economy food doesn't have a reputation for being 5-star, but the pasta I had was rubbery, tasteless and inept at hiding the fact that it was mass produced. Finally, Saudia could invest a little in improving their online/app features for requesting special meals as they were difficult to navigate and calling was too much trouble due to prolonged wait times. In summary, Saudia is a great full service airline to fly for those who value comfort and service for a price that doesn't break the bank!

### "Terrible customer service"
I booked a flight last September from Bangkok to Amsterdam in April 2023. Everything was ok until i got a message last night that my first flight was rescheduled to a week later while the other flights were on the date of departure. I tried to contact the airline, but they only have a bot reacting and told me to contact them by phone. After I called the employee told me to change my booking on the website. There were no other flights available so I contacted the airline again and they told me they couldn't help me if there were no other flights available. I asked them how they can reschedule the first flight and not change the rest of the flights. They couldn't help me with anything. Terrible customer service and I wouldn't recommend this airline to fly with. This was my first and last booking with this airline. I had to book a new flight with another airline and getting my money back is also a hustle.

### "the worst airline ever"
This is by far the worst airline ever. I have had my ticket changed by phone due to weather issues from a midnight flight to a 5:40 pm flight, and they confirmed it to me by phone, and by the time I was at the airport they told me that my ticket has been canceled, and that I need to buy new tickets for my family and I to go back to Dubai. They refused to cooperate with me, the call center would say that they have raised it to a department and the ticketing office would say it’s not our problem and asked me to deal with call center. They kept fooling around until the flight was about to close and I was forced to by new tickets to go back home at a ridiculous high price. And now they are refusing to refund my previous return ticket. I will never book this airline or recommend anyone to book it, and if The Kingdom expects to bring in more tourists through this airline and with this customer service, then good luck. And if I could rate this airline a zero rather than 1 star I would do so!

### "I had a horrible experience"
I will never recommend this airline. I had a horrible experience in October 2022. We missed our flight due to the fact of not providing the wheelchair for my mum and they wanted us to buy another ticket. They don't want to admit their mistake.

### "Don't fly business class with Saudia"
Don't fly business class with Saudia, it's not worth the money. They didn't have anything available from the menu, flight attendant disappears for 30 minutes, I kept asking for water, they weren't happy about it and they kept bringing me little cups of water. They didn't have any bags left that they gave to everyone, never fly with them again and don't recommend them.

### "Customer Service is nearly not existing"
Customer Service is nearly not existing. A WhatsApp number is provided, but the wait to be served can be hours. When you receive a reply, if you dont respond within the minute, your request is closed and you have to do all other again. So nearly impossible to get through the system. Similar experience on the phone. When you do get through, including by raising an official complaint on the system, you get told it is resolved, but when checking, it is not. And the loop starts again. This is the main issue I'm facing. But overall, food quality is below average, plans are not very clean and prices are therefore high for what you get. I'm now waiting for over an hour at the head office only customer service center, waiting to get served for over 1 hour.

### "fliers beware - customer service is non-existent"
I flew Saudia Airlines Jeddah to Washington Dulles in business class. My seat would not operate so I could not adjust the seat. My entertainment system did not work so I could not watch the entertainment. Not what I expected or paid for (over $8,000 USD) during a 14 hour flight. The flight attendant supervisor tried to no avail to fix the problems, causing a disruption in the cabin multiple times. He provided me an email address for Saudia customer relations, which I have emailed a week ago with no response (and multiple follow on emails also with no response). Saudia website has a customer feedback form but the website just spins when you try to submit (I've tried to submit every day for a week to no avail). Saudia has an online chat but they just send you a link to the website form that does not work. So - that's the customer service you get - nothing! By the way, before the flight I had trouble with the Saudia app and each time I called an agent they gave me an email address for assistance and you guessed it - none of my emails were responded to. So fliers beware - customer service is non-existent.

### "there was mismanagement all over"
Not Verified |  The staff didn't respond to call button even though there were passing by. At Jeddah Airport, there was mismanagement all over, there were no proper queuing system and enough staff to handle the pressure. Airport was in poor condition, toilets were dirty. The flight from Jeddah to LKO was even worse. They even did not provide the pillow and blankets to everyone. Upon arrival on my final destination i got to know that my baggage have mishandled at Jeddah. I am trying to call baggage support but they is no one pick the phone.

### "Super impressed with the product"
Super impressed with the product. Excellent Business Class seats that go totally flat, the crew were super attentive and catering was very good indeed.

### "Flight Attendants looked tired and disorganized"
First time with Saudia Airlines, totally different between the first leg Amsterdam-Jeddah with the second Jeddah- Lahore. I fly with Saudia because I belong to Skyteam Alliance and I'm a Platinum pax so I have a lot of benefits. Amsterdam-Jeddah with B787 in ECO: Ground staff very kind in Schipol and she put us in the exit seats, that means a lot of leg-room. The service was good, doesn't stand out especially if you compare with other Middle Eastern airlines. But a little better than American or European airlines. Seat ok with foot-rest, entertainment ok, food ok, a little plus with amenity bag with earplugs, eyes mask and socks. Of course no alcholic drinks. Flight Attendants were kind and ok. In Jeddah transfer: nice and new airport, very clean and everything is new. For connecting flights you should pass other security control, that was a little bit messy between the line for normal pax and the SkyPriority line. Luckily had a lot of time to transfer. Jedddah-Lahore with B777, was totally different. We upgraded (biding system) Aircraft looks old. Flight Attendants looked tired and disorganized but very kind (because C class?). The most important was that I could sleep a couple hours. Food on demand but was not really special. Will I fly again with them - probably yes if the price is ok and of course will still be in the Alliance.

### "different impression between first and second leg"
Not Verified |  Once again different impression between first and second leg. Lahore airport is old, a lot of security, a little bit disorganized, Checking counter staff was kind and once again she put us in the row with big leg-room. The boarding gate area is a mess, no priority lines. Its like the wild west and after passing the boarding pass control another security control in the finger just before get onto the plane. So delayed, one hour. Lahore-Jeddah, B-777, in ECO, totally full, majority of passengers were pilgrims to Jeddah. Service on board - this time there were no amenity bag for red eye flight. I had bad luck with the pax next to me, big and his arm reached over my side, that was very uncomfortable. I didn't eat nor watch any movies, just slept or tried to. Flight attendants attitude was totally different, less kind. Transfer in Jeddah, this time was better, because there were hardly any people so it was very fast. Jeddah-Amsterdam, B-787 upgraded by biding system (paid 370 eu.) and totally worth to pay it, totally different business class than Jeddah - Lahore. Nice seat, comfy. A plus, chef on board. Amenity bag from Missoni. Nothing can compare with Emirates or Qatar Business.

### "They would vanish from the counter and would not give answers"
Not Verified |  Very bad, in future will never fly and would never recommend to anyone. Even though we are on time for connecting flights, they had cancelled our seats on connection flight anticipating a delay from primary flight and were made to wait at the counter without proper answers, without food or water on the floor for 7 hours. The service people took our boarding passes and misbehaved with people. They would vanish from the counter and return after hours and would not give answers. We were treated as we animals without proper seating, without food and water, and when we asked for some water they would straight away refuse.

### "it couldn’t care less"
Do not fly with this airline. My experience with Saudia was not only the worst that I’ve had with any airline, but also the worst I’ve had with any company. The customer support is virtually non-existent and when you need any form of help, this company proves that it couldn’t care less. I flew with my girlfriend from Frankfurt to Bangkok with a layover in Riyadh. The TVs in our row didn’t work on both flights, but otherwise the flights went okay and the food was pretty good. Once we landed in Bangkok we realised my girlfriend’s bag had failed to arrive. We had noticed in Frankfurt that the Saudia representative at baggage drop hadn’t actually put the bag on the baggage carousel, but at the time we didn’t think much of it. Luckily, we had an Apple AirTag inside the luggage, so we could see it was still at Frankfurt Airport and had never left. We reported it to the baggage department at Bangkok Airport, although there were no Saudia representatives in Bangkok specifically. We filed a Baggage Irregularity Report and were told that Saudia should send the bag within the next few days. Saudia never sent the bag to us. We tried contacting them so many times over the following days and weeks. We emailed so many email addresses that we found online, but the majority of them were not even real accounts and so our emails failed to deliver. We tried calling customer service representatives for Saudia in Thailand, Germany and the UK, but either the phone numbers didn’t work, they just didn’t pick up, or they said they couldn’t help at all and we just had to fill out the form online. We filled out the online compensation form in August 2022, but to this day have received no response. We spent nearly €100 on calls from Thailand to Saudia’s helplines but nothing worked. We tweeted them many times and while they did message us back saying they would help, we never heard anything further. This was especially frustrating as the whole time we could see with our AirTag that the bag was just sitting in Frankfurt Airport. It was clear to us that Saudia were making no attempt to find the bag. Eventually, my girlfriend’s parents had to travel to Frankfurt Airport to find the bag. They asked around and showed that they could find it with the AirTag. Luckily, with baggage staff at the airport, they found the bag. Frankfurt Airport then flew it over to us with Thai Airways, and then we picked it up from Phnom Penh airport in Cambodia, more than two weeks after the bag had gone missing. The worst part was that Saudia never listened to us. They have no customer service and did not offer any help. We contacted Saudia again and again to tell them we knew where it was, but nothing. We even went back to Bangkok Airport to talk to Saudia representatives in person who are only in the airport at specific times when flights are happening. They were friendly but offered no help, blaming Frankfurt Airport for the issue. When we contacted Frankfurt Airport, they blamed Saudia for not looking for the bag. It was clear to us that if my girlfriend’s parents hadn’t gone to the airport to find the bag, it would’ve just been left there and eventually auctioned off. We have still received zero compensation.

### "really nice staff"
Kuala Lumpur to Milan via Jeddah. Great airline, such amazing food and really nice staff. Like the food is amazing. Comfortable seats, good entertainment.

### "I was so disappointed with the service"
I am asking for a seat refund with this airline, I paid for an extra leg room seat and paid about 95€ only to be given a middle seat, I was so disappointed with the service. The ground staff in Riyadh were super tired and no apologies were heard, not even a simple sorry, he just let us stand on the side waiting for all the passengers to board and said in a very cold rude manner "I cannot do anything, the seat was taken" that's it. I have a terrible leg pain so I always travel and sit in an extra leg room seat, but this time was disappointing, Saudia please return my money.

### "had a great experience"
Just wanted to thank the team of Saudia, had a great experience though coming back from Manila to Jeddah - had a delayed flight still its outstanding. Kudos to Janelle Rodrigues the flight attendant who done an exceptional job, and also to Leticia Santiago. Keep it up, will surely fly back with you guys.

### "A terrible travelling experience"
Not Verified | AVOID at all costs. This is one of the worst airlines (if not the worst) I have ever flown. While the planes and the cabin crew are reasonable the rest of the organisation and staff are not. we booked flight 6 months early to ensure everything would be ok. Getting through to them if you have a query is extremely difficult and after 50 or so calls still no clarity on seat allocations/changing dates/times and other queries. When you do there is no one who can really answer any question or can even speak some English. Website is not very informative. Check-in is VERY unfriendly and you are asked for documents that are not asked on other airlines. The final straw was when we missed a flight in Jeddah to Dubai the customer services were EXTREMELY unhelpful and rude given we had 2 young children stuck in Saudi at 12.30am in the morning. In fact they cancelled all our onward flights and did not make any attempt to help us get on our original flights. Instead they made us purchase new flights at a very significant cost. They split our luggage and sent some to Dubai and off boarded some in Jeddah. On the return journey the plane landed late and we had 45 minutes for our connecting flight in Jeddah. There was no real attempt to help us get to our connection and were left in Jeddah airport at 1.15am in the morning with 2 young children to figure out how to get our connection in the short window. A terrible travelling experience. Please avoid as your holiday may become an unpleasant experience regardless of the cost.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
Saudi Arabian Airlines is the worst airline I have ever flown. I travelled from US to Jeddah, and the plane was clean and staff was somewhat nice. Then from Jeddah to Lahore, Pakistan, the staff was very unprofessional and the airline was not well-maintained, it was like riding a local bus. On my way back to the US, they would not let me board food items on the plane, when that is not the case going to Pakistan. They made me check-in my food items, which were inside plastic bags. By the time I came to the US, my food was damaged and my bags were damaged. Saudia Arabian airline staff and the airport security at Jeddah have serious attitude problems.

### "I can't see how Saudia can compete against the various Gulf carriers"
Where do I even start?? I opted to upgrade to Business Class (I made an offer and it was accepted) and wish I never did. The coffee is truly horrible (no taste of coffee. It is dark yellowish as you can see for yourself in the photo). They had no special meals option neither in economy nor in Business (they wrote to me on their WhatsApp number that the special meal option is currently suspended). It is mind boggling that on routes from India a major national airline would not have a vegetarian option and I even suspect they ejected this on purpose! The only good cabin crew was a Filipina girl who really did her best. An Indian girl and a local Arab guy (both young in their late twenties) did their job fine. The rest of the cabin crew were not service orientated in any way. About 60% into the flight from Istanbul to Riyadh (the map showed that the plane was above the Red Sea) the flight attendant told me they ran out of drinking water (!) I realised this already during the meal service when people were prompted to ask for soft drinks or juice as there was no water left. This practice of not stocking enough water (despite that the flight was 75% empty!) is criminally negligent because if an emergency of any sort occurs and a flight must be diverted (it happened in the past couple of years more than once due to Yemeni missiles) the passengers are left with no drinking water for up to 4 or 5 hours which is not ok! The new airport terminal in Jeddah is beautiful but the food options are ridiculous. Warning: the terminal is freezing so bring a jacket and long pants unless you wish to get a bad cold during your journey. Each and every food venue in the terminal is a junk food outlet and (again) there is no option for vegetarians. During the check in process and despite that I flew business class the ground staff had no idea that I don't require a visa to Turkiye. They really should train their staff to realise that EU passport holders don't need a visa to Turkiye and that this has been the case for half a century already instead of wasting passengers time at the check in desk for twenty minutes. The airport in Riyadh is old and the lounge is below mediocre. You can't even get a decent coffee in the entire terminal which pretty much sums up the experience. The in-flight entertainment is a (bad) joke. On the Mumbai to Jeddah flight they had a two hour programme showing how a Saudi Prince won the Saudi Cup. Passengers had no choice but to see this prince jumping up and down for long minutes waving a large golden cup (at the same time the Nepalese or Indian jockey was awarded a tiny trophy). The toilets were not cleaned during the flight. In fact the business class toilet was not even sanitized before the flight from Mumbai to Jeddah (I was the first one to use it and noticed hand cream was spurted on the space above the toilet seat!). I can't see how Saudia can compete against the various Gulf carriers with such policies (it can't).

### "Good price/quality"
Nice flight with Saudia. First fly from Paris to Jakarta via Jeddah. Everything on time. No problem with our suitcase. Jeddah airport is clean, but no WIFI available. People working in the flight were nice. The screen to watch movie was old and not working. For the return we arrived only 35min late in Paris. 2nd flight was nice. I would recommend Saudia Airlines. Good price/quality.

### "I would not recommend Saudia"
I flew from London to New Delhi, India with Saudia on 23rd of September, 2022. My layover at Jeddah was changed from 12 to 24 hours and I am informed only a day before flying. When I reach Jeddah and ask if I am being accommodated in a hotel, I am being told the airline is not responsible. The staff was rude and impolite. He told me to complain about the delay on the customer care as if writing at the last hour would solve my problem, when he in person was not ready to entertain me. They have all the time to send you emails regarding upgrades for business class but they don't have time to send you emails about the delay. I was probably expected to take a transit visa and find a hotel somewhere in Jeddah city which I have never visited and that also at night. The airlines was least bothered about my safety and discomfort. First they do not inform you about the delay on time and then put all the blame on you. On top of that wifi at Jeddah airport was not working. What a bizarre situation I was in. I would not recommend Saudia if you have other options in hand. Though I have no complains about onboard facilities. Flying attendants were good. The food was tasty with more options.

### "The food is delicious"
Kuala Lumpur to Istanbul via Jeddah. I am impressed with the professionalism. Cabin staff helped my father in law to transfer from his wheelchair to cabin wheelchair inside. The food is delicious and there is a small section at the back designated for Muslim prayers - very generous to empty 4-9 seats for this prayer allocation. The staff also provide sandals for us to take ablution without wetting our shoes.

### "Never again"
I did the check in normally. However the same day of the trip, my flight got postponed two days and they didn't tell me. They didn't send an email, SMS, call, nothing. I learned because when I consulted on the webpage the cost of upgrading my seats, there I saw that the flight was scheduled for two days after (so they did send me an email to upgrade my seat but not for telling me that I had to wait two days to flight). I couldn't call the airline because their "client service" was not working. The WhatsApp service is absolutely useless. So I wasn't sure if the flight was happening or not and I could talk to no one. Never again.

### "Expected service"
Family travelling, ground staff in Riyadh helped me to reallocate seats together. Boarding smooth and on time. Cooperative crew. No entertainment (overhead screen) Sandwich below average. Expected service for one hour and 10 minutes flight.

### "worst airline service ever received"
The worst airline service ever received. Our flight was cancelled after waiting two hours at the boarding gate. They cheat us on the food and the hotel. Don't gave us any information. Claiming refund and compensation is a nightmare. None of contacting channels are working. We lost 28 hours and two connection flights. Watch out!

### "staff are attentive and caring"
London to Riyadh. SV from my point of view is improving, boarding is smooth, staff are attentive and caring. Entertainment is one of the best. Food quality is between 7-8 on scale of 10. Ticket price is higher than other Gulf airlines although Saudia operate 3 flight daily between LHR and RUH reflecting the demand.

### "the worst I ever experienced"
Amsterdam to Jakarta via Jeddah. I cannot understand that an Airline like this could exist. The service on board is the worst I ever experienced. I called the customer service because something went wrong with my upgrade to business. My offer was accepted but only for 1 person instead of 3. I cancelled it and do it again, again it was accepted but again only for 1 person. I contacted Saudia on Facebook and after the autobot they say they would contact me for this upgrade but they didn't I called the following telephone numbers from their contact list : USA, Singapore, Saudia, Kuwait, Qatar, Jordan, UK, Germany etc. (so all the phone numbers) because I booked online I contacted the agent and they also could do it for me and told me again to call to Saudia. I told them I cannot reach them and they told me they cannot do anything for me. After that Í emailed them and again not reply until this day. I never experience this kind of service before. And I'm not letting it by for this. I find this the WORST airlines that there is for customer service. I hope after other people see this review they won't book there. It's not worth it

### "it’s worst flight ever"
My first time I would like to fly with Saudia and its not acceptable. Cancellation of the flight without saying the issue, we been waiting for a long time with a poor services, how they speak with us about this big issue it’s like nothing happened. Our transit become 7 hours in Dubai 7 hours in a Riyadh, like we don’t pay for our flight. I won’t recommend this flight at all,  it’s worst flight ever

### "poor communication skills"
My flight was booked half economy and half way was business class. This experience reflect economy class. Washington to Jeddah, flight entertainment system not working, and wi-Fi not working. I expressed my concerns and they were not very helpful. Staff was giving me excuses after excuses that are trying their level best. This is 12-14 hours flight and you can imagine how difficult it was for us. Food quality is mediocre, Chicjen Biryani had no taste, chick peas salad was stale, unhealthy options. Later they served chicken salad sandwich as a snack , it was wrapped in plastic wrap with 3 pcs of bread, it was more bread then sandwich. In the economy, people are treated very different and poorly. Ground staff poor communication skills and appears rude when you approach them for a question.

### "ridiculously low fare in business class"
Would have never considered Saudia in the past but chose it because of ridiculously low fare in business class. Every single element of the flight wad good to great. Check in in Athens and in Kuala Lumpur was easy and there was a dedicated business counter. Transiting in Jeddah was straightforward but I assume we benefited from being first off the plane. Lounge in Athens was ok. Jeddah was very spacious and totally empty. Decent food selection. . In Kuala Lumpur Saudia is using the Malaysian Airlines lounge. Flights were reasonably on time. There was a 60 min delay taking off in KUL but it didn't affect our connection. Staff were friendly and helpful in all segments. On the ATH-JED segments the crew was very attentive. Seats are standard Flatbeds on the 787. Perfectly comfortable for a good night's sleep. I was impressed by also having Flatbeds on the small Airbus. Didn't use entertainment system. WiFi was supposed to be available but we couldn't find it. Food was good to great. It's on demand service and we managed to go to sleep after take off and only eat once we woke up. No alcohol served. Luggage was Priority tagged and arrived first. I was really impressed and relieved, Especially at the low price point. Would I choose Saudia over other airlines of the price was the same? Probably not. But for a decent Biz experience at a very low price I can't fault it.

### "worst airline I have ever experienced"
Saudi Arabian Airlines is the worst airline I have ever experienced in my life. My booked luggage never arrived at final destination. I strongly advise everyone not to travel through Saudi Arabian Airlines because its a mess. They don't have any ground staff to help you.

### "I had a very bad experience"
I had a very bad experience today with the crow of flight number SV 590 from Jeddah to Dubai We were six passengers with an infant less than one year and we was traveling with a small stroller as it's a night flight and the babe is sleeping most of the time and we used the same stroller with us from Dubai to Cairo and same on the way back The crew team have shown unacceptable behavior by showing their finger to keep the stroller aside and not to take it inside the airplane same as we did on our previous flights. When I asked the reason he said that's my shift and I don't take stroller inside. I asked to speak to the supervisor just to explain to him that we used the same from Cairo then he seems to be not the supervisor and refer me to the crew who have showed same attitude with no explanation as if I begging from him.

### "extremely stressful and traumatic"
Singapore to Amsterdam via Riyadh. My sister and I bought a return flight ticket to travel from Amsterdam to Singapore. We saved a long time our money for this trip, because we are only students. We had a lovely travel, until it we had to fly back. We tried to check in into our flight at the counter on the airport of Singapore. However, we were denied to join the flight. The reason for this was that we didn't had a transit visa. It was very traumatic and stressful for us to be denied from this flight. We tried everything we could to obtain a transit visa. However, the website to gain a transit or tourist visa was not working The my.gov.sa denied access to open the website. The other website was not working because we couldn't upload any pictures. We tried everything but nothing worked. We were well informed about this flight before we left. We checked all the information on the emails, website and flight information. However, nowhere was written that we needed a transit or tourist visa to be able to access this flight. It was extremely stressful and traumatic to have been denied access to this flight and we feel scammed by this happening. There were 14 other passenger with us that had the exact same problem. We had to be back in the Netherlands and we were forced to book a very expensive new flight ticket to Amsterdam. No one is willing to help us out. We cannot get in contact with the airlines, as they do not respond to any messages. Therefore I highly recommend everyone to NOT book a flight with Saudi Arabian Airlines.

### "Highly disappointed with the service"
Not Verified |  Highly disappointed with the service. My flight back and fro both very bad. The inflight entertainment system doesn't work. The crew doesn't understand English, and doesn't want to help. All they say is its a problem for everyone, why are you complaining and say that they cant do anything about it. I would never recommend this Airline to anyone. I opted for Asian meal veg meal, which had rice, potatoes (half cooked) and black beans - the taste was awful.

### "they just told me to write a review online"
Flew Manila to London via Riyadh return with my family (2 adults and 2 children). The flight from London to Riyadh has a much better experience as the aircraft are newer and have a better entrainment system (touch screen). However, Riyadh to Manila is a much worse experience. In fact, on our outward journey, the entrainment system was not working for 1 one of us on both legs. The return journey was even worse, 2/4 of the entertainment systems were not functional on a 16 hrs journey! When I raised a concern to a crew member, they just told me to write a review online to influence the, as they put it, "high bosses". All in all, the experience was just about okay, the food was relatively okay and most of the staff approachable. Will I fly with them again? Probably not, unless the fare will be much cheaper in comparison to other airlines.

### "Luggage lost"
Luggage lost because of 2 hrs transit through Jeddah, flight was Dubai to Kuala Lumpur, as I understood 2 hrs is not enough time to relocate the luggage and it left in Jeddah.

### "the Captain and the crew left immediately"
I had a business trip from Madrid to Riyadh on July 30, 2022. My ticket was on Saudia. After 50 minutes from take-off, the plane landed in Valencia. The Captain informed us that there was a mild technical difficulty that would be fixed in an hour, after which we would resume the flight. When we landed in Valencia, the Captain and the crew left immediately without providing the passengers with any information. The only persons available were the ground service personnel in Valencia airport, who informed us that they had no details and that the Saudia crew had left. The captain asked Valencia ground staff to let us know that the flight would depart from Madrid the next day, August 31. So we had to find our way to Madrid. It was already 3 am when we got the information. The passengers and I were obliged to spend the night on the floor of Valencia airport with no food or water because all the facilities in the airport close at night. I booked a train ticket for 70 Euros from Valencia to Madrid at 7:30 am. When I arrived at the airport, I was informed that the flight had been re-scheduled for July 31 at 6 pm. I tried to check in at the counter at 2 pm, but the agent told me there was no flight, and she did not know when the flight would leave. After waiting four hours, a message arrived that the flight had been re-scheduled to August 1 at 6 pm. This means more than 48 hours of delay. This resulted in my inability to go to my business, I had two bronchial asthma attacks, and I paid a lot for transport. I called Saudia more than ten times, and they never responded. I sent them complaint forms with no response.

### "One of the worst airlines I have ever flown"
One of the worst airlines I have ever flown. On international flight how can you ran out of eye covers and food when you knew well in advance it was a full flight days in advance! Service so slow that half the passengers weren’t even fully served when it started to land. They kept ignoring non Arabic customers and stood and talked for several minutes at a time and brought snacks for Arab speaking customers. I will never ever fly or recommend Saudia ever! Take Qatar, Etihad, Emirates or Turkish and go longer way but avoid Saudia at all costs!

### "an extremely disappointing flight"
Not Verified |  The airline has a clean good onboard product, but the service needs much improvement. I flew Bangkok to Dubai with a layover in Jeddah. Saudia business class adopts dine on demand concept. however they provided no menu card on my Bangkok - Jeddah route. The crew had absolutely no knowledge of the food onboard. They serve 1 meal for an 8 hour long flight and had a very dry presentation. The crew forgot to serve jam/butter for the plain croissant and honey for my yoghurt and when asked rudely replied they are provided on request. The call button is not attended promptly and the crew is not warm and hospitable. The dining experience was disappointing and no munch or beverage service at all throughout the long flight. On my Jeddah to Dubai flight, they rain out of options for meals and was forced to eat only an Arabic bean breakfast which was the only sole option. The in flight entertainment features a decent screen & a headset, but a below average selection for options. For an proper middle eastern business class experience Saudia is not even 10% of what Emirates, Etihad or Qatar offers onboard. Overall an extremely disappointing flight

### "Overall a horrible flight"
Worst Experience! Awful behaviour of Ground staff. Food served only one time when flight time is more than 7-hours. No tea or Coffee. Cabin staff were very arrogant. Some were shouting at passengers by harsh attitude. No standard of service! Overall a horrible flight.

### "service quality has decreased significantly"
I am not completely satisfied with my recent experience with Saudi Airlines, even though I hold Alfursan Silver Elite SkyTeam membership. Unfortunately, the service quality has decreased significantly in the recent period. Through several trips, I noticed a big difference in terms of guest care when calling the customer service centre you will wait for no less than 30 minutes, even when you were holding the premium membership, and most of the employees, if you reach them, will not solve your request or make it complicated and not initiating the service. The quality of food on board has deteriorated even to the business class and not only to the economy class and also the fulfilment of requests by ground staff or flight attendant mostly average to bad, and I noticed a lack of flight performance to leave or arrive on time in several flights and also even a large increase in prices and in return without good service I used to choose Saudi Airlines previously for several reasons, including the special membership that I carry, which gives me many wonderful services, beside the average to good service and reasonable prices, but now I will make this company my third or maybe fourth choice, even if my membership is reduced, it does not matter much.

### "I will fly with them again"
I was really concerned about my experience with Saudi Arabian Airlines after reading online reviews. I am very satisfied with my flight. Ground crew was nice. Flight crew was caring and courteous. No missing bags also. I will fly with them again.

### "never fly this airline"
Not Verified |  I recently flew from New York to Kochi via Jeddah and this is by far my worst flight experience ever. I have been flying internationally for 20 years and not once did I go through such horror. All my 6 baggage went missing. The Saudia staff who checked my baggage in NYC apparently sent it only till Jeddah, even though they handed the boarding pass till Kochi. After hours of fighting with them over the phone, 5 of the 6 bags reached after 8 days. One of them is still missing after 10 days (at the time of this writing) and Saudia is not picking up the phone. Their website to claim compensation for the missing/delayed baggage isn't working. I'm extremely frustrated and helpless at the same time. Do yourself a favour, never fly this airline.

### "airline hasn't contacted us yet."
I had an 18 hour flight with Saudia Airlines from DXB to JED and a transit to MNL this 01 July to 02 July 2022. Unfortunately, we are all aware of the stress and frustration of a long flight. I had 2 luggage from DXB, the exhaustion of not finding my luggage at MNL was really a nightmare! Most of the passengers specially with transit did not find our hard worked goods and things. it has been 24hrs and the airline hasn't contacted us yet. I was trying to call the numbers on the form they give and the call won't go through!

### "it was a hell of flight"
It was a connection flight, first one from Egypt, Cairo to Jeddah which was delayed by almost 2 hours which is happen some time, and flight has good quality in terms of legroom, other facilities (charging plot, small screen etc), then the connection flight delayed by more than 3 hours were most of the passengers were on-boarded, but the flight still waiting 3 other connection flights arrival. It's terrible to sit in an aircraft waiting for your fellow passengers with out providing any facility. Even though it was a hell of flight which arrived 3 hours late at COK and we waited for long for the luggage, which was not taken from Jeddah. After a long wait have to register the complaint which took 2-3 hours. and finally the officials said the luggage will deliver to your door steps in the coming days, and provided a number to follow up, but till now they never picked up or call back.

### "no customer service for Saudia"
I was transiting in Istanbul from Nur Sultan via Saudi Air to get to Bangkok. My Saudi Arabian Airlines flight in Istanbul was cancelled. This was one of the worst airline experience I have had as a frequent flier with over 400,000 miles flown. I had to spend 25 hours in transit (15 hours in Istanbul and 10 hours Riyadh) instead of 4 hours as per my original itinerary without any compensation, accommodation or food. When I first arrived at the transit desk in Istanbul, the ground staff told me that the flight was cancelled and that I should call my travel agent. My travel agent then told me to contact the ground staff for accomodation. On returning to the transit desk, I was told that there was a shift change and new staff will be there in 5 minutes. Instead, I waited for 1 hour, and was told by a staff that the flight was cancelled and he could not do anything about it. After much discussion, a staff told me that their system shows that I am rebooked on a flight on July 9, 10 days from my current flight. He said I should head out of the airport to check with the Saudia office and that someone would be there (there was no one after I went out). This was at 2am and I called four offices for Saudia and had no response. I ended up traveling downtown and booked my own hotel after calling the travel agent and he informed me that I was rebooked on a flight 15 hours later. For our next connection, we had a 10 hour layover. The airline staff told us to contact customer service for Saudia when we arrived regarding accomodation. But there is no customer service for Saudia in Riyadh! The information desk kept redirecting us to non-existent customer service desks. The lounge staff for Saudia claimed that they manage the lounge and don't have any relationship to Saudia. I am hoping to get accomodation compensation and damages for my two overnight long layovers (I had to cancel hotels/onward flights as a result of these and had to book hotel stays and taxi in my layovers).

### "aircraft are dated and unkept"
Not Verified |  The check-in staff is slow, the aircraft are dated and unkept. The wheelchair desk is unresponsive, the airline ground staff makes us feel like they are doing a huge favor by letting us fly their airline.

### "arm rests in coach class are randomly broken"
Not Verified |  Ridiculously small food portions and broken arm rests. I flew coach class from Jakarta to Jeddah on Saudia's B777-300 ER, their leather seats are comfy and leg room is spacious. For a ten hour flight the catering was ridiculously limited. An hour into the flight they served a small pizza-snack, and catering was only continued with a breakfast once flying over the Arabian peninsula. Breakfast was Tasteless scrambled eggs, without any side dishes at all. Just a single bread bun. Coffee with milk? Not available. They only serve coffee with creamer-powder. The arm rests in coach class are randomly broken respectively liftable. Flight was half empty and I could had turned my seat row into a bed, however as the arm rests weren't liftable I couldn't make any usage of the empty seats next to me. Different to the passenger in the row in front of me for instance. Inflight entertainment was also randomly broken/working. In my row, not a single screen was working. Also, their digital menus in the inflight system weren't updated. It is a bit weird on a long haul flight if the captain doesn't bother at all to get in contact with his/her passengers via a board announcement.

### "almost 2 hours to queue for checkin"
This airline has only 3 counters opened in Schiphol Amsterdam airport. It took us almost 2 hours to queue for checkin. Very bad experience and it was really a tiring process. They should consider adding manpower given with the passenger volume.

### "Very bad service!"
Very bad service! Bad service during the flights (did not collect the food, delayed flight, etc..) and lost my baggage! Tried submitting the lost baggage form on the website thousands of times but could not submit! Need to keep re-entering the info to try again. Complete waste of my time!

### "no food given, rude staff"
Amsterdam to Lahore via Jeddah. Cancelled 5 days in advance, after a lot searching, translating and arguing finally got to speak to someone(none of the numbers work) via WhatsApp. 3 different people promised me tickets would be refunded every time I spoke someone new apparently the previous person forgot to start the refund procedure. Finally got refunded a little less than half the amount paid, no explanation. No one to complain to or ask for info. Bad service on flight no food given, rude staff

### "the worst airline I have ever tried"
Honestly it is the worst airline I have ever tried in my life. Never again. My flight from Male was supposed to depart on 7 may 2022 however after doing all the process and entering the plane after 3 hours of delay, Saudia decided to cancel the flight just before departure. Imagine we were inside the plane and they told us to go out as the crew need to rest. What a stupid excuse. Everyone was shocked and thought its a joke. However it was a nightmare as we have to wait in the airport for 24 hours for their next flight. None of the crew where giving any explanation beside they were so rude, arogant and unprofessional. Anyway i learned my lesson never ever fly with cheap dirty and unprofessional airline like Saudia.

### "aircraft is so filthy and very old"
Not Verified |  Jeddah to Manila my wife's food special request they don't have, we book and request since February and its confirmed so Jeddah to manila my wife didn't eat anything. The aircraft is so filthy and very old. Manila to Jeddah same problem, my wife no food request again, and the worst part our luggage they don't want us to put any food snack in our carry on bag.

### "Will never fly them again"
The poorest ever logistics, delays, cancellations and last minute changes! Will never fly them again. On 4 consecutive flights everything that could, did go wrong and the ground staff is useless and rude.

### "airline refused to give the additional compensation"
We scheduled our trip to Male for the dates 01/04 to 08/04. Our flights were cancelled a few days before departure date, with no reasons given. The alternative option proposed by the airlines was to depart on 05/04, obviously not feasible as we booked hotels already. Customer service is unreachable from EU. No news about tickets refund yet. The airline refused to give the additional compensation which EU passengers are entitled to when flights are cancelled less than 14 days before departure date. They did not give any reason for it. I now have to contact an agency to process this claim and pay expensive fees. Never again.

### "flight was cancelled"
Amsterdam to Dubai via Jeddah. Never again. Flight delayed at first (original departure time 15.55h), finally boarding at 19.30h. At 20.00h (still waiting to enter the plane) the ground staff came to tell us that the flight was cancelled. Only because the pilot had issues with his crew and their flying hours. After the cancellation, no service was provided. All passengers had to find their own way to a certain service desk where (as we were told) they would take care of the situation and try to book all of us on another flight. This service desk was nowhere to be found, nobody was willing to help us. When we finally found the service desk, they told us that maybe the flight might leave after all. (Our luggage was still on the plane). At 21.30h they confirmed that there was no flight and there were no other possibilities to fly to Jeddah or Dubai. The bags should come any minute, the said. At 23.30 h we were still waiting for our baggage. All that time there was no possibility to get something to eat or to drink; not even water was provided. Short summary: the issues of one pilot of this airline did cost us our complete holiday trip to Dubai, to which we were looking forward to for months - no other possibility was offered. Thanks a lot, Saudi Arabian Airlines!

### "flights were pretty underwhelming"
Not Verified |  My first experience of flying Saudia, the dates I needed plus the value for money made it quite a viable option. I was happy with the booking process plus the contact centre communication, as well as email updates and the app too. Saudi Arabian lose scores because that they have absolutely no idea what customer service means, my connecting flight was rebooked for 15 hours later and I only found out at the boarding gate of my flight, apparently because the flight from London to Jeddah left 30 minutes late I was rebooked. I was completely frustrated as people were boarding the flight to Islamabad and I was just left. There was no help offered by anyone at the airport, I was asking to speak to a representative from the airline but no one was available, 15 hours wasted in the lounge and there was no offer of compensation / accomodation. Logged a complaint but heard nothing back. I will still be pursuing them. The flights were pretty underwhelming, uncomfortable seats, unresponsive screens and cabin crew seemed chaotic and frustrated, the meals were okay and that's pretty much it. I won't be flying with them again, as the whole experience was annoying especially as there was no explanation for why the flight was rebooked also that there was no one to approach about it, any attempts to complain or approach staff were batted away, with the lack of English being cited as the reason for not understanding....

### "Awful customer service"
Not Verified |  Awful customer service - avoid at all costs. The help desk attendants were all on their cell phones and refused to serve my family and I. They passed us off to 3 different people simply because they couldn't be bothered to help us. When we approached them to help us check in for our flight, the tone of voice and their attitude was completely unacceptable. First the ladies passed us off to the next counter attendants, because they wanted to spend time on their cell phones instead of helping customers. Then when we tried to check in our additional baggage, the men kept sending us back and forth between the guest relations simply because none of them knew where to pay the fees for the additional baggage. Absolutely useless.

### "Poor quality airline"
Poor quality airline - dirty interior and no seat belts available for infants (not a one-off experience - I’ve had the same experience on three internal flights).

### "Absolutely horrendous experience"
Absolutely horrendous experience with Saudi Arabian Airlines. Booked a one way ticket and wanted to cancel it to rebook a return ticket after only a few hours (due to additional research), so I went to Manage my Booking as the website requested - only to not be shown any options to change or cancel. I then went to the Refund page, submitted a request, but was not shown the refund amount and website directly proceeded to tell me to wait for the cancellation and refund (and their website is not clear whether they have a 24H full refund policy). I tried to contact them via the website chat as well as whatsapp - after 5 hours there was no response by any agents. I then made the final decision to call their HQ, incurring expensive overseas call charges, waited 33 minutes, and was answered by a bored-sounding customer service staff. I introduced myself and asked if it was okay if I used English to converse. He paused for 5 seconds, then terminated the call. Tens of dollars down the drain.

### "Never travel with them"
Amman to Mumbai via Jeddah. Worst Airline with no support. Never travel with them, they are the worst. No ground support and no instructions. Food was also really bad.

### "worst airline I have ever experienced"
I booked my flight with booking.com, but Saudia cancelled my flight 1 day before boarding. I contacted booking for refund but they sent to me e-mail explaining that the company is not answering. I tried to reach their customer office, no answer, finally 3hrs before boarding I got answer by phone, but they refused neither to change my flight in same day or after one day nor to refund my ticket saying that ticket was issued by hahn and they should refund. It is the worst airline I have ever experienced in my life. I don't advise any person to try flying with Saudia.

### "I have a really bad experience"
Did check in at the biz counter in Madinah airport and was served by a rude gentleman. Finally he told me he need a health declaration which was required by Singapore government. After I have completed the online declaration i start again the check in. This time he asked for the booking ticket for my onwards flight KUL- SIN which was operated by MAS. I told him many times that it was reflected on the ticket which i have printed out. The flight details is clearly shown on the printed hard copy ticket. He told me that MAS luggage allowance is 16 kg per pcs. I told him it’s ridiculous and ask him to show me where he read about the luggage allowance. When i read, it is actually referring to carbon emission details and nothing about the luggage allowance. I told him that the info he read is nothing to do with luggage allowance. He then issue the boarding pass after a long unnecessary disruption he made on the service experience he had caused which I clearly unnecessary in the first place. I paid a high price for a fast and efficient service (Business Class ticket), but instead I have a really bad experience.

### "amazing attention to the level of details"
My experience in flight SV20 on Feb 21 2022 was great. The care and the level of service was awesome. The amazing attention to the level of details paid by the crew to each passenger was noteworthy. It felt like if you're flying a private jet. Having a Flight Chef on board makes a great deal of difference in the level of service.

### "cabin crew are pleasant on this route"
SV 0834: JED-KUL. I only flew this airline because the date of my travel was changed. I thought it can't be that bad. Extremely rude and arrogant ground crew at check-in at Jeddah International Airport with privileged attitude that made us feel as if we begged to fly their airlines. Fellow friends get shouted at. However, cabin crew are pleasant on this route. Get their job done well accompanied by a genuine smile. Seat and food are pretty standard. Never again.

### "Cabin crew are not very efficient and chaotic"
SV 829: KUL-MED, Pretty standard flight. Cabin crew are not very efficient and chaotic. Toilet wet and overflowing and uncleaned. Saw a cabin crew pour leftover coffee into the toilet bowl with drips on the toilet seat and didn't bother to clean it up. Seat, food and entertainment are otherwise pretty standard.

### "Try to avoid at all cost"
Horrible. Try to avoid at all cost. Lied about ability to use points, tried to scam me by stranding me in a foreign country and forcing me to pay cash, ignored and hung up when I tried to resolve. I have flown with Saudia numerous times ( out of necessity) and I still keep getting surprised by the level of inadequate services and overall incompetence. On a flight the service is great; however the preflight experience, from booking to customer support is horrible. I have booked 2-way flights using points to find out a few days before my return flight that my booking was in fact not confirmed and that I would have to pay cash (basically sent me to a foreign country, then juked me into paying for a ticket) - I found out by chance when I called them regarding something else, they did not even have the decency to tell me. I have tried multiple times to submit a complaint using their customer relations hotline but have had the phone hung up on me multiple times. I have also requested for a supervisor to reach to me but have not heard back in quite sometime. Their customer service is pitiful, it apparently seems that their frequent flyer program (AlFursan) has been out of commission for a couple of months now.

### "Very poor customer service"
Never fly with Saudia. They do not comply with aviation law. Very poor customer service. When you ask for help on the hotline, you get kicked like a soccer. I was COVID positive and emailed Saudia customer care. They replied telling me to call customer care and explain the same problem again. That did not work either. At last I tried Saudia Lost baggage claim WhatsAp number. The result: I lost my money and time.

### "business class lounge is closed"
We booked business class and found out upon arrival at the airport that there is no business class lounge which is closed due to covid. The check in staff did not alert us to this fact nor did they give us any compensation for the closure. We had to look for other food outlets at the terminal and as it was 10pm at night all of them were closing. The flight was smooth, with good service but no menu was offered, the attendant reads out food choices from a list written in pencil and there is no salad given accompanying the heavy food.

### "worst experience of all"
Not Verified |  Manchester to Jeddah. All pre flight booking/ticket information from Saudia Airlines stated that departure from Manchester Airport on 15/12/2021 was from Terminal 1. Even phone calls to their customer service team confirmed Manchester Terminal 1 for departure. In actual fact, upon arrival at terminal 1, there were no check-in desks in Terminal 1. They were in Terminal 2! Upon arrival at King Abdul Aziz Airport in Jeddah, waited over two hours for luggage, because, it had been sent to the wrong zone within the airport. This is a newly built airport. No seats in baggage claim. Standing for over two hours, waiting for luggage. No refreshments provided. Not even a bottle of water. Despite protestations to airline staff, just got shrugged shoulders. Nobody cared. Nobody took accountability. This is what Saudia Airlines calls Business Class service. Have since raised several complaints for pro rata compensation claim for these issues on the airline website and, each time, the complaint is closed without acknowledgement of the issues raised or acknowledgement of the compensation claim. Absolutely appalling service. I have flown with 20 airlines worldwide, this happens to be the worst experience of all. Typical arrogance.

### "third-rate customer service"
Worst customer service experience I've ever had with an airline in 33 years. We were due to fly from JFK to Delhi, connecting through Jeddah, on December 20th. Saudi proactively cancelled our flights from Jeddah to Delhi with no heads up. Pandemic and preemptive travel closures, sure. We had to call the customer service department multiple times just to cancel our full itinerary. They kept giving us the run around - telling us to contact their WhatsApp support line (more on this), or to email them. Finally, after no success on those fronts, they were able to cancel the flights on our 5th or 6th phone attempt. They claim the customer service phone department - where you can talk to humans - is completely disconnected from refunds processing - and you can only do the latter via WhatsApp or email. The WhatsApp support is the laziest, most lackadaisical responsiveness I've ever seen. They claim 24/7 support but regularly take 6-10 hours to respond to a chat and start a conversation. When they do reply (usually with 1 word or 1 line), if you don't reply within 10 minutes they close the chat out and you have to start the conversation all over again with another agent. - I repeated this cycle for 4 days on repeat just to be able to submit a simple refund request for a flight they cancelled. Phone support was unwilling to process a refund. Once I did eventually get through a submit a refund claim via WhatsApp, the phone agent was unable and unwilling to give me any indication of refund status. So, unclear now whether I've even been refunded for a flight that they cancelled. Do not fly Saudi Arabian Airlines. Read other reviews showing the kinds of third-rate customer service operations they run.

### "Very disappointing"
Flight was on the runway for almost an hour before pilot apologised and stated that there was a technical problem that needed to be solved at the gate. Stranded in the aircraft ever since. I had to ask for water and then a further round was given to us. We are supposed to be 2 hours into the flight already. On the way here the food offered was worthy of a budget airline - waffles and a hard croissant for breakfast. Very disappointing for a Skyteam Alliance member.

### "Keep up the good work"
I absolutely loved it, seats were very comfortable, food is exquisite, and I absolutely loved the napkins to clean the teeth. The flight entertainment can be a bit more diversified and recent. At the check in counter the lady was very sweet and helpful. Keep up the good work, and looking forward for my next trip.

### "changed my mind completel"
I used to travel on Saudia then I switched to Emirates due to incline in the service level, but my two recent trips have changed my mind completely. From check in counter to Aircraft condition, food and beverages to the arrival and collecting the luggage is all smooth.

### "Abysmal customer service and appalling flight"
Abysmal customer service and appalling flight. Console didn’t work and pre-requested meal option was non existent even though it was clearly shown on e-ticket. No vegan option. An apple and a banana was offered for a 5 and a half hour flight. After 3 months of chasing Customer Care and an email reply of thanks “for conveying your remarks and comments, which are in fact attaining the concern and attention of the high ranking officials of “SAUDIA” I rang today to find the case had been closed with no notification and no resolution. This case highlights how utterly incompetent and non decision making Saudi Arabian Airlines management and customer service team are in dealing with what really is a small matter. Nobody takes ownership of a customer’s complaint. No idea of customer service experience. Dread to think what would happen in more serious circumstances. Avoid at all costs.

### "seats and meals are good enough"
Not Verified |  Jeddah to Dammam. The flight was smooth and the seats and meals are good enough. Crew was helpful and cooperative. We've take off from Jeddah on time at new terminal. But the transportation from the terminal to the plane was by bus not the tunnel.

### "a mixed bag for me"
Saudia was a mixed bag for me; the seat on the b 773 was old style; not lie flat the crew on the JED ATH was lie flat in their nicely refurbished a 320. Managed to sleep some hours nevertheless. Crew was on CGK-Jed rude, no interaction at all from female flight attendant and the purser had no clue. Jeddah to Athens the cabin crew was very friendly though. Tried some of their specialty drinks like; mocktail bellini and dade smoothie! Food is on demand however mostly crew try to serve it immediatel . Quality and quantity is good and so are the headsets/comfort bags etc. Toilets on the 777 flight were run down, transfer in JED from the south terminal to new terminal was acceptable. Lounge in new JED terminal is fine - all lovely decorated this terminal really will be perfect to transfer when all flights have moved here and all is finished. Lounge food also fine. Lounge in CGK a really let down - Garuda lounge that is. Mileage on saudia is also attractive . Will fly again

### "Great seat in business class"
Jeddah to Kuala Lumpur. The Boeing 787-10 is the newest aircraft of this airline! Great seat in business class! The flight attendant is very attentive! The menu is not a great choice. Internet did not have time to install in this plane

### "The staff is attentive"
Jeddah to Athens. This route is operated by an ordinary A320 plane with reclining seats, but not flat beds. The staff is attentive. The food is average, there is a choice between European and Eastern

### "The food is average"
Athens to Jeddah. The airline claimed to have flat beds for sleeping on this type of aircraft. Actually puts A320 planes with reclining seats. The food is average, there is a choice between European and Middle Eastern.

### "with full flat beds!"
Jakarta to Jeddah. It was a new plane, only 3 years old. Business class 2-2-2 with full flat beds! There were few passengers. The menu was good, but the food quality is average. Stewards are good.

### "I wouldn't recommend Saudia"
Munich to Islamabad via Jeddah. The flight from Munich to Jeddah was not or less okay. However waiting area at Jeddah airport was horrendous, it was jam packed however I am not complaining about that, the service on the flight Jeddah to Islamabad was okay not as par with flight from Munich to Jeddah. However the airline redirected my return flight to another city without any notice. Then they proceeded to cancel the first leg of the same journey, their online portal becomes useless because it blocked any input from me by a popup, I am not sure if it is a bad design or was done intentionally such as to prevent me from taking perfectly legal actions. Their call centers do not respond at all. The calling number they provided doesn't entertain international calls. I wouldn't recommend Saudia, if your flight takes off then probably you will be okay but do not expect any after sales service from them.

### "no hand sanitisers in the bathrooms"
Not Verified |  Karachi to Gizan via Riyadh. The economy class in the A320 of this airline is so good as the plane looks and feels new and seats are very good in A320 but when it comes to 777, all things are compromised. My country is a developing 3rd world country and most people flying on the 777 is labour class and the plane is used for them. Boeing 777 from developed countries are exceptionally good but they are bad for developing countries. There were no hand sanitisers in the bathrooms even the the corona virus is spreading rapidly. The crew is not very friendly but they are alright.

### "provide us with excellent service"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Amman via Jeddah. First time ever traveling with Saudi Arabian Airlines, usually we travel with Emirates. Got my sister and my niece ticket from Amman to Los Angeles. I can't say enough about the person who checked us at the airport in Los Angeles her name is Susan, she was very patient, took her time and provide us with an excellent service.

### "airline was amazing"
Karachi to Paris via Jeddah. The airline was amazing, great crew and food was amazing. Comfortable seats and the flights were punctual. Check in staff from Karachi and Paris were friendly.

### "they ask for transit visa"
Calicut to Washington via Riyadh. I could not travel in Saudi Arabian Airlines. There was a 14 hour lay over in the Riyadh airport. I got to know that they ask for transit visa for spending time at Riyadh. I contacted the ticket agency, Goibibo, they tried to contact Saudi airlines, the online agent waited for 8 days for a response from Saudi Airline, but they never got. I tried to contact Saudi Airlines myself. I called to airport airline help desk, but their first answer was "cancel the ticket" we cant help with a transit visa. I asked for a full refund, and lost money as a cancellation charge from Saudi Airline and even ticket agency Goibibo took a good amount of money from my refund.

### "missed our flights because of them"
Not Verified |  Dammam to Manila with a connecting flight to Riyadh. While we were in Riyadh airport the airline took too much time waiting in the tarmac. Saudia did not even inform us the technical problem, we have waited inside the plane hungry and eventually they told us to leave. We left the plane disappointed and disgruntled. Saudi Airlines gave us the choice to either wait for the next flight inside the airport or go to the hotel which they have booked for us. We decided to go to the hotel, the hotel was very poor and awful. The worst part is, mostly of us have a connecting flights. I have a local connecting flight from Manila to Cagayan de Oro city which i have missed of course because of the delay. Some people got an international connecting flights as well, we have complained to the staff and Saudia office both in Riyadh and Manila. They never refunded us at all with our failed connecting flights, they told us - it's not their responsibility! We have missed our flights because of them and yet, they're not helping us with our connecting flights.

### "they were out of vegetarian meals"
Los Angeles to Mumbai via Jeddah. First of all let me start with meal plan. There were multiple options to select meal online for eg: Hindu meal, vegetarian meal, etc. My husband selected hindu meal for us as we didn't wanted to eat vegetarian meal as we had heard it is mainly has boiled spinach and boiled rice. He also called the airlines just to confirm if we will get vegetarian food in Hindu meal. The customer executive said Its Hindu meal it will be vegetarian. When we got our food in our flight, we saw chicken pieces under the rice and we called the flight attendant, she said she is confused as she even thought the same,  hindu meal is vegetarian. And they were out of vegetarian meals too. For our entire flight to Jeddah, we were served only one entree meal. They didnt have snacks too. Other disappointing thing while using Saudi Arabian airlines is the layover at Jeddah. Its one of the worst airports to have your halt. The bathrooms are dirty.

### "it was a good flight"
Tabuk to Paris via Jeddah. Overall it was a good flight, food was acceptable and cabin crew was very friendly and welcoming. My luggage was lost in the return trip. The main issue is customer support if you have any issue, not existing. They do not answer to emails, WhatsApp and keep you on hold for minutes on the phone, so disappointed from that point of view.

### "happy with their help"
I traveled through Saudi Arabian Airlines from Manchester to Jeddah round trip. I had some problem with ticket modification. I contacted saudi airline team and they facilitated me very well. I'm happy with their help.

### "attendant were nice and helpful"
Not Verified |  Jeddah to Dawadmi . My flight was in the middle of the day which was so busy in term of operation since I was traveling domestic, as soon as I got to the airport the check-in agents helped me with the boarding with smiles and all information I needed when asked for. They took the passengers by bus, because the aircraft was in a remote apron, when arrived flight attendant were nice and helpful, serving meals was great with good options although it was a short flight for one hour and 15 minutes.

### "a rather good flight I must say"
Managed to get a good deal on Saudia from Kuala Lumpur to Istanbul via Jeddah. Was a little apprehensive having read the reviews on this airline but was surprised on how pleasant the flights were. To be honest, the pitch on their economy seats was a lot better than many legacy airlines - plenty of room to stretch the legs (and I am 5'5) and the front seat barely touched the knees even when fully reclined. Leather seats, so cool and comfortable. Was served 2 meals for a 7+ hour flight and they were quite delicious. Many have written that the plane toilets were dirty but I did not encounter that on all my Saudia flights on this trip (even on the return Istanbul - KL flight which was full). The only gripe was that insufficient water was provided throughout the flight - you have to ask for the extra bottle. Movies were not aplenty but there were some new Hollywood selections. A basic comfort kit was even provided for economy class passengers - a nice touch. Overall, a rather good flight I must say. I would fly this airline again especially with the 2 x 23kg baggage allowance they give! And no, they did not lose any of our luggage - everything arrived at the respective destinations well and good. Now coming to the airports - on-route to Istanbul, the transit airport was Jeddah for 1.5 hour layover. Yes, the transfer area was crowded and the toilets were not so clean - but coming from Malaysia, they are not that different from our highway toilets - wet, doesn't smell good but honestly, tolerable. Coming back, the layover was at Riyahd airport - bigger, more pleasant although only 1 toilet area for the whole departure lounge.

### "haven't received the water"
My seat was 48L I asked for the mineral water because the one given earlier finished. The stewardess says 'later'. After 1 hour I have not received, I asked again the same stewardess when she passed by and until the end of my journey I haven't received the water as requested - bad service. The toilets seems not checked by the staff and it was awful. Do not intend to fly with the airline any more.

### "Worst experience"
Not Verified | Munich to Lahore via Jeddah. 8 hours of delay. Delay is not the issue, they have written a rule on board that if your stay is more than 6 hours they will give you a hotel room. Now they are saying that the rooms are only for EU, American and Canadian passports. And they only give transit visa to EU, American and Canadian passports. Worst experience. No compensation. The terminal is poor. No place to eat. No KFC no McDonalds nothing.

### "all marks to their efficiency"
Not Verified |  Lahore to Jeddah via Dubai. It was my first time travelling via Saudia with family. The flight was at 11 AM, we reached airport at 7:30 AM and after checking process / security reached counter at around 8 AM> The check-in staff was good and they were cooperative, anyhow they took alot of time as the lady issuing boarding cards was new induction Flight was on time and those who were with families were called to board the aircraft before travelers travelling alone. The attitude of male flight pursers at the aircraft door was harsh and a lot was left desired. Aircraft was new. Flight was uneventful, smooth takeoff and food was served about after 45 minutes. They had two meals chicken or fish, my son opted for chicken but he did not like it, he being diabetic needed to eat, so I asked flight crew for additional meal for him, which they obliged, rather their attitude towards my son became more caring. We landed on time and since we were transit passengers so we were sent to transit lounge. Then for the next flight for Dubai once I passed through the security check / check-in counter it was found that Saudia Staff at Pakistan has issued me with two boarding cards for Lahore to Jeddah flight, however other family members had correct boarding passes. This caused delay in my move to aircraft and consequently my family was also stopped, however after checking our tickets and online confirmation we were allowed to board the aircraft. Cabin crew on our flight to Jeddah was very cooperative, kind and caring, all marks to their efficiency. The aircraft was new and very clean.

### " I lost my tablet"
Dammam to Los Angeles via Jeddah. I lost my tablet when arriving from Dammam and transit to Jeddah. I discovered that I missed it in the plan when I was in the security check point. I contacted Saudi Airline almost 35 minutes from my arrival. They said they checked the plane but did not find anything. The Executive managers did not help at all. As I complained, they made me miss my next flight. I was left with nobody to talk to till 10:30 am. I cannot go back to the border as my exit from KSA was final. I had to book a new flight. I paid from my own pocket the new trip starting after 17 hours from my arrival to Jeddah. At around 10:30 am I told my story to the next shift manager. I asked him how to catch the new booked flight. He helped me at around 12:0 pm to catch the flight booked on Etihad to Abu Dhabi then LA. Saudi airlines did not transfer my checked luggage to Etihad  and ended up with no luggage at the end of my trip. Saudi Airlines is lacking professional services and customer respect.

### "I was totally ignored"
Jeddah to Dubai. My seat 35L window I was totally ignored, the cabin crew only interacted with the gentleman sitting at the aisle. Very surprised to see that they were serving ladies after men not caring of a simple worldwide etiquette, never happened with other airlines. My seat was broken and really uncomfortable I was trying to ask for a cushion but I gave up since they did not care of me. Moreover the access to the lounge in the terminal is restricted to frequent flyers and they don’t accept credit cards.

### "luggage left behind at Jeddah"
I travelled with Saudia on 5th December from JFK to Dhaka via Jeddah, and arrived at around 1.30 in the morning. After long flight when I went to pick up luggage the Saudi airlines ground operation crew told me that the luggage has been left behind at Jeddah. They told me that it Will be coming next flight. They ask my info and told me that they will let me know when it is available. After 2 days no communication from them. Then I called them back and they said it will Take another 2 days to 3 days. I requested them to get the operation managers phone number they refused to give. I am helpless at this point what should I do. All my belongings with checked in bag.

### "Seats are not that comfortable"
Jeddah to Manila business class. Aircraft that time was their old B777-300. Seats are not that comfortable and it will not give you fully reclined seat compare to some of their Boeing 777-300. No overnight given to us the fact that we are in business class, one of the pax was complaining to the CM regarding the kit but all he can say is shortage although he apologized. Given the fact that their tickets are not cheap. While their business class lounge is so outdated and small. Toilets are small and dirty, selection of foods are limited. If Saudia is trying to compete with Qatar Airways and Emirates they should improve their airport, lounge, make their aircraft clean, and fix their old aircraft. In my opinion nothing can beat Qatar Airways with regards to their in-flight service, their well maintained aircraft, hospitality of the crew on board, friendly ground stuff, their huge and beautiful first/business class lounge.

### "movie selection is so terrible"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Hyderabad via Jeddah. The crew was rude, the food was so bad that I didn't eat. The asked me to move seats because I was traveling alone, which I willingly did. But, the entertainment system didn't work in seat they moved me to, so they moved me to another seat, but the seat recline didn't work. And I know it's only a slight recline anyway, but on a 15 hour flight every little bit helps. The movie selection is so terrible. The few they had were edited so poorly that it wasn't worth watching. And to top it off, Jeddah airport is the most disgusting airport I've been too. Please don't fly them. I'm sorry to provide such a negative review, but they truly earned it!

### "Very bad service"
Not Verified | Los Angeles to Jeddah. Very bad service with very little portions of food. If you ask for extra bread they say we don’t have extra. Bathrooms are very dirty. The staff have a very bad attitude. No respect for passengers. Never had this experience with any airlines before it’s my first time and my last time with Saudia. I don’t recommend it to anybody.

### "reached a new low"
Dubai to Washington via Riyadh. Every day in this part of the world there are things that I find frustrating. Customer service is generally quite bad as a rule. It is almost never up to the standard that western companies provide. But I must say that Saudia Airlines has reached a new low, in having the worst customer service I have ever encountered in my 12+ years here in Dubai. I bought a business class ticket on Saudia, from Dubai to Washington Dulles, USA. My outward bound flight was on June 26. I paid to upgrade to first class. The seat, seating area, plane and toilet were all old and worn, and worst of all dirty. Without any explanation, the date of my return flight was changed. That meant I had to at my own expense buy a new connection ticket. At the same time they changed my flight, they changed my seat, seating me next to a stranger which I specifically did not want. It took emails, phone calls, and I was repeatedly told nothing could be done. Finally at the airport, after causing me much stress about this, an agent changed my seat, and then, and this is my big complaint, and one that I want to be addressed, my entertainment system did not work. No picture, no sound. I asked the flight attendant for a voucher to spend in duty-free, was told no. (That is what British Airways does in these situations). I asked for a note stating my system did not work, they refused to give me one, saying that it was in the records on the plane, no need for a note. I have written three emails concerning this, called twice. so far in over a month, I have received nothing. Nothing! I provide all the information, and on the phone, they tell me they cannot find my record.

### "I recommend Saudia"
London to Jeddah. My experience with them was actually very positive. The staff at the gate were polite and friendly. Cabin crew members were welcoming, smiling and available throughout the whole flight. The food was OK. I wouldn't say the IFE selection was great but not bad for a 6 hour flight. The airplane was pretty new and clean. I recommend Saudia and will be more than happy to use their services in the future.

### "discourage you to fly this airline"
Very bad experience on Saudia. Business class seats are angled and are not flatbed, the airplane is not clean. Food is quite mediocre. Staff quality usually is unpredictable: I had one stewardess that was very good at what she was doing, the other one was a total disaster. Only amenity kit for women were handed out, the ones for men appeared to have run out. When complaining about the seats not going fully flat to the cabin chief he started a discussion. He came back with the stewardess about 10 minutes later. I was asked to get my things out of the empty seat next to me. When asking what they were doing the cabin chief mentioned he would show me how flat the seat could go. I asked him to get out of my eyes and leave me alone for the rest of the flight. Usually on Saudia flight you also will have the experience that staff think it is more important to have a tea party in the front pantry and do not care at all about business class passengers wanting to sleep during a red eye flight. As on this flight, the cabin chief is always male and usually very lazy and incompetent. I absolutely discourage you to fly this airline. It's business class product is inferior to that of most other airlines.

### "Dont recommend at all"
My flight from Medinah to Jeddah delayed by 20 minutes and there was also 30-40 minutes delay to pick the luggages up. Because luggages wasnt coming at all in baggage claim area. We also lost our baby stroller laggage and 2 zamzam water packages after 40 minutes. Because of this delays we missed our 8.25 am BA132 flight to London in North terminal. This caused us many expenses going forward and backwards between terminals and finally booking a hotel at Jeddah for one night and rebooking a flight to London tomorrow afternoon. I tried to get as much as help I could from Saudia customer service, ticket counters, and supervisor. None of them helped in any way and it's a very poor service provided. I filed a complaint only to hear after 10 days that they rejected it because my connection flight is not Saudia but British Airways. Dont recommend at all.

### "positive improvement in Saudia"
Manchester to Jeddah. An enjoyable flight, fairly empty and good attentive staff, good food and a nice and newish plane. Check in to boarding was smooth and staff were polite. I have noticed a positive improvement in Saudia flights the last few times I have flown internationally. Free wifi for whatsapp usage is a nice touch. They are catching up and becoming much closer to a reasonable airline.

### "I had faulty IFE"
Not Verified |  London to Riyadh. I was annoyed that the check-in person weighed my hand luggage, especially as both my checked luggage pieces were well below the limit - as was my hand luggage. The reason for the annoyance was that it is obvious they let some passengers take too much luggage on board. They should tackle them and not the ones who do stick to the weight limits. I had faulty IFE on my way to London and again on this flight - very poor, especially as these are fairly new planes. I suspect the person behind me also has problems because he kept hitting the supposed touchscreen quite forcibly. Also the same issue with food as on the first leg - not enough of it. The other surprising thing was that the food from Riyadh was much tastier than that from Heathrow - the opposite of what one would normally expect. In any case, I was glad that I had eaten in the lounge. Apart from these issues the flight was fine. The experience gets spoilt by the mayhem at Riyadh airport's luggage carousels which are too small and in too small a space. Not Saudia's fault, just the airport handling many more passengers that before. Nonetheless, Saudia have always delivered my luggage on the same flight and without causing any serious damage to it (unlike Emirates). Happy to continue flying with Saudia and always taking some food with me.

### "an excellent flight"
Not Verified |  Riyadh to London. This was an excellent flight with Saudia except the IFE was not working properly and the food, though reasonably tasty, was of insufficient quantity. It is very poor that the IFE screen on an aircraft that is only two and a half years old was faulty. These two issues aside, the Flight Attendant was excellent and made for a very pleasant flight. Last year (probably in response to complaints about the food) Saudi introduced a new service model where items are handed out individually rather than being already on a tray. The problem with this is that it takes a very long time for the food to be delivered, especially if you happen to away from where they start the service. Overall, I still prefer Saudi on this route.

### "flight was suddenly cancelled"
I booked from Dubai to Kuala Lampur via Riyadh, after check in the flight was suddenly cancelled, later their excuse was bad weather, there definitely was not bad weather, I checked myself. I was rebooked via Jeddah, flight arrived very late, I missed my appointment, Saudi airlines compensated me 98AED only, absolutely a disaster.

### "had a pleasant experience"
Not Verified |  Nice experience onboard my Saudia Flight from London Heathrow to Jeddah. The plane was quite empty at that time of year so we had more space to roam around the aircraft. The food was decent and had a pleasant experience with Saudia.

### "they get worse and worse"
Jeddah to Riyadh. Unfortunately, since I presently live and work in Saudi Arabia, I have to fly on Saudia often. This airline never ceases to disappoint me! It seems that they get worse and worse. On this latest occasion, the flight departed Jeddah late, the delay was never announced on the airport screens and the Saudia personnel knew nothing. Once the flight arrived in Riyadh, the passengers were sent to a carousel to "pick up their luggage. No one mentioned to the passengers that the plane had left Jeddah without 95% of our baggage. There were no Saudia reps at the carousel and the passengers, including myself, were left waiting 1 and 1/2 hours for our baggage. Needless to say the baggage never arrived. Finally we were told to go to their claim desk where they had two reps to deal with over 150 passenger claims. We were given a claim number and told we would receive a text when our bags came in and that we would have to return to the airport for them, no such thing as sending the bags to you. For three days I attempted to call their baggage service center without response, I never received a text. I finally returned to the airport on the 4th day and found that my bag, along with thousands of other bags from Riyadh flights over the previous 5 days were piled up in a corner. I wish I did not have to fly them again, however there are only a few choices here and each is worse than the other!

### "wait in the airport for 7 hrs"
My flight from Amman to Jeddah was already delayed 2.5hrs therefore I missed my 7pm connecting flight in Jeddah going to Riyadh. When I arrived in Jeddah they issued new boarding pass where i will need to wait in the airport for 7 hrs. As I expected all transit passengers luggage went missing! And luggage airport staff gave us a claim card and the customer hotline written there was no answer. A customer service cannot be reached! I think this is the worst that a passenger could experience. The luggage airport staff even said they will send me an sms if they found my luggage at 10am. But until this review writing I dont receive any sms coming from them. Will I recommend Saudia? Definitely No!

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Kuala Lumpur to Casablanca via Jeddah booked for September 2019. This is my biggest mistake to purchase Saudia Airlines flight ticket. I understand flight company normally will reschedule their flight if you purchased an earlier ticket, but Saudia definitely is the most frequent company who do that. I had purchased my ticket one year ago and they had changed the flight time for 6 times. In the end they cancelled the flight number and I force to stopover at Jeddah for more than 12 hours. I have to apply a visa for that. They are not going to responsible for anything and i had to rearrange all my hotel bookings and car rental bookings. I had no choice to refund because the price of other airlines all increase more than double. After this happened I only saw many of the reviews are telling how bad is them. Too regret that I didn't notice about it earlier.

### "staff were not helpful at all"
Had a connecting flight from Riyadh to Manila via Jeddah (round trip), and it was not the smooth trip that I was expecting. From Riyadh, they moved our hand carry luggage from the cabin to the checked.in luggages without even informing us since there were no more room for our bags. Upon arrival.to Jeddah we asked the FA and they cannot even give us assistance how we can get our luggages. We waited at the conveyor and when my handcarry bag came out, it was a mess, it was covered with dirt and along with me were the passengers who were also waiting for their luggages for more than 2 hrs, worst part was nobody was assisting them.or helping them find their bags. On my way back to Riyadh, unfortunately I have connecting flight via Jeddah again. And since we were instructed from Manila that we will be collecting our bags in Riyadh, I was confident that I no longer need to get my bags in Jeddah, but then again, another problem came up. When we asked the ground crew in Jeddah, they said we need to collect our bags and drop it again at the counter. There were no instructions given beforehand and if you will not ask them they will not also inform you. The staff were also not helpful at all, not customer-friendly.

### "Would not recommend Saudia"
Arrived at Dubai via SV564 from Madinah last night. Half of our flight people were missing luggage, Registered a complaint, Saudia representative at Dubai airport confirmed that our luggage is in the Jeddah flight landing at 11:00 pm last night, and will be delivered to our hotel right away as all the drivers are notified and waiting for our luggage. I was told it’ll be here in an hour. Would not recommend Saudia.

### "Such a nightmare"
Such a nightmare to what happened go my flight with Saudia Airlines, route Manila to Riyadh via Jeddah. They lost my luggage from JED airport. What they just did, took my contacts and the details of my luggage like how it looks like and just gave me a card where I can contact them for updates. Really disappointed that time because I was left with no options and it seems they are not sorry for what happened, very unprofessional! Went to our accommodation with just my backpack and very exhausted from a long travel. With this kind of issue, most probably you will think that they will apologize, send your luggages from our doorsteps for free and of course, will keep you updated. Instead, you will spend another bunch of money (since i dont have a car of my own) from going back and forth to the airport and worst, busy line. Really a nightmare! Took 9 hours after I arrived (RUH) when I got my luggage with my own effort.

### "no inflight entertainment for us on a 9+ hours flight"
The Good: Check in from Manila went smoothly. FA’s from Manila to Jeddah were kind and timely. Jeddah to Riyadh, FA’s were okay. The Cons: On SV 871, particularly on my seat row, both entertainment screens on my right were not working. On my own screen in 49J, my screen was working but the headset port was busted and did not work. There was no inflight entertainment for us on a 9+ hours flight. Also, wifi services were not available/operational. On the connecting flight from JED-RUH, SV 1056, our takeoff was significantly delayed for over 30 mins or so. Because of luggage issues, I tried calling the hotline of the airline for both Riyadh and Jeddah buttons and only heard that the service to attend to my concern was “not available”. I tried tagging them on my social media platforms, but received no response either. As of writing, no customer feedback has been received from Saudia Airlines.

### "rescheduled to next day"
Not Verified |  I am writing this review with a very disappointment. Today (09/08/2019 Saturday) morning my wife supposed to travel from Jeddah to Kochi. But due to flood problems in Kerala and closure of Kochi airport the service was rescheduled to next day morning to Calicut Airport. During that time Staff  behaves very irresponsible to passengers. They told the flight is rescheduled due to problem in Kochi and its not our fault so we can't help you and you need to wait for 24 hours to get another flight to Calicaut. During the 24 hours waiting time they didn't try to arrange a flight to Trivandrum or they didn't provide any food, water to all these passengers. They didnt show any sort of kindness to passengers who paid a big amount for their travel.

### "The seats are comfortable"
Jeddah to Madrid. The seats are comfortable and the crew is nice. The flight was on time and I had no complaints. The ground service wasn't satisfactory in Jeddah Airport and one of the clerks was rude to me concerning luggage.

### "not recommend flying with them"
Not Verified |  Frankfurt to Hyderabad via Jeddah. The layover at Jeddah was a horrible experience. They also changed the boarding gates at the last minute at both stages of my journey. In-flight entertainment sounded quite distorted, probably an issue with the headphone ports. In addition to all that, they managed to lose my luggage mid-way. In fact about 30+ people from my flight did not receive their luggage at the destination. Would not recommend flying with them unless you are hard pressed for money.

### "third party third grade service"
I booked SV772 from Jeddah to Mumbai. But they change it to SV 3772 without giving the option to cancel it. The airplane was pathetic. As I entered there was no AC running, the flight was by a third party. There was no crew from Saudi Airline and no one giving any answer for it. Even no one was sitting there as per their seat number. I can say the airline was cheating to their passenger by taking the money for good airplane and providing them third party third grade service. I will caution the passenger if saudi airline change the number then you should immediately cancel it.

### "Saudi has improved significantly"
Riyadh to Frankfurt with Saudi Arabian Airlines. I have to say that Saudi has improved significantly during the past few months. It has one of the most comfortable and affordable economy classes that is less crowded. I look forward to travelling more often with them.

### "not recommend at all"
Not Verified |  Jeddah to Riyadh. The flight was late for more than 5 hours and they announce that is late and reschedule every 30 min until we wait for more than 5 hours with out any apology or reward or sky team points nothing at all. I miss important meeting because of that and I heard from the other travelers that it is normal from this airline company to be late starting from 2 hours to 9 hours and they do nothing about that. Very bad experience with this airline, not recommend at all.

### "I ended up with lost luggage"
Jeddah to Alexandria. This is the worst airline ever! Save your money and book with literally any other airlines. I am a 22 year old Saudi female that has traveled over 6 continents with over 40 airlines, I take anywhere from 6-36 flights per year and unfortunately Saudi Airlines is the worst of all. I have never had one good experience with this airline. I ended up with lost luggage, a broken seat, rude flight attendants, and a bad start to my vacation. Just to show you how bad this airlines is, even if I were travel within the kingdom I actually take an international flight and transit just to go from one city to the other in Saudi to avoid this airline.

### "keeps worsening by time"
Damman to Cairo. Worst experience and keeps worsening by time! Luggage did not arrive on the same plane, not even the same day, and we were informed to follow up with the customer service on a daily basis and whenever they're available we'll have to pick them up by ourselves, not even have it sent to our place as a gesture of respect. After being told that all the bags are readily available in the airport, one bag went missing and their only response was "wait for 5 days and then you can file a report in the airport and get a compensation". No care was given to customer satisfaction nor convenience. And it is not the first time bags arrive later!

### "the service is slow"
Milan to Jeddah. Our family chose this airline due to its generous baggage policy (2 luggage 23 kg each person) and they did honor this when we checked in. Check in process was quite smooth and problem free, all luggage was checked in based on quota. The A320 interior looked impressive with quite generous seat pitch. The entertainment system was also not bad at all - very wide selection of entertainment options to choose. Cabin crew seemed polite and of different cultural backgrounds. However the service is slow (I didn’t get what I ordered) and I pressed the ‘call’ button several times and no one showed up. I also ordered a few things on the entertainment system from the inflight sales catalogue, however no one approached me to deliver or enquire on my order - I wonder why they even have this order system in the first place. Wifi was available but for some reason I could not connect. So I recommend the airline if you are a tourist with a lot of shopping, like not to spend too much on airlines and yet have a lot of luggage

### "cabin crew was helpful"
London to Dhaka via Jeddah. Food was good, cabin crew was helpful for me, as a economy class the seat was ok. While transit in Jeddah airport was so small you have no place to sit, because people are sitting in floor, so tiny terminal, I had pay and taken lounge.

### "company refuses to compensate us"
Colombo to Paris tickets via Jeddah. After check-in at Colombo airport, we were first informed of a delay of 2 hours, then again 2 hours before outright cancellation of our flight. For flight memory: Departure on 07/04 at 18h55 from Colombo Arrival 08/04 at 08h30 Paris CDG After many hours of waiting (from 16:00 to 01:30 am), we were supported by your company and housed in the hotel. It was followed by more than a day of waiting without information and without any luggage until a flight is offered to us on the night of 08/04. Departure from Colombo on 08/04 at 01:10 am, arrival at Paris CDG on 09/04 at 19:30. Obligation to eat at Colombo airport while waiting for your treatment (meals that were normally required in the airplane). Obligation to buy on the spot the minimum of clothes and objects of necessity. Two days of additional leave to take from my employer. The company refuses to compensate us for what is inadmissible! We will never recommend Saudi Arabian Airlines. FR: Nous avons acheté le 3 avril dernier, via le site internet Saudia Airlines deux billets Colombo-Paris, via Jeddah sur le vol SV788 puis SV127. Passagers : Tristan FILY - Billet n°0652111149645 Bérangère Bastien - Billet n°0652111149644 Après enregistrement de nos bagages à l'aéroport de Colombo, il nous a été signifié tout d'abord un retard de 2 heures, puis à nouveaux de 2 heures avant annulation pure et simple de notre vol. Pour mémoire vol : Départ le 07/04 à 18h55 de Colombo Arrivée le 08/04 à 08h30 à Paris CDG Après de nombreuses heures d'attente (de 16h00 à 01h30 du matin), nous avons été pris en charge par votre compagnie et logés à l'hôtel. Il s'en est suivi plus d'une journée d'attente sans information et sans aucun bagage jusqu'à ce qu'un vol nous soit proposé dans la nuit du 08/04 au mardi 09/04 (heure locale). Départ de Colombo le 08/04 à 01h10 du matin Escale à Bangkok de 04h00 Arrivée à Paris CDG le 09/04 à 19h30 Conséquences : 1. Obligation de se restaurer à l'aéroport de Colombo en attendant votre prise en charge (repas qui étaient normalement prévus dans l’avion) 2. Obligation d'acheter sur place le minimum de vêtements et d'objets de première nécessité 3. Deux jours de congés supplémentaires à prendre auprès de mon employeur et manque à gagner de deux jours d'activité professionnelle pour mon conjoint. Aujourd'hui, la compagnie refuse de nous indemniser ce qui est inadmissible ! Nous ne recommanderons jamais Saudia Airlines ! ! !

### "the WiFi didn’t work
Jeddah to Manchester. The food is terrible,  I also purchased the onboard WiFi and it lasted a few minutes before it cut out, when I highlighted this to the staff I was told I could only receive WiFi if I was business class. The problem was, I purchased the WiFi and it didn’t work.

### "the service is worsening"
I have been traveling Saudi Arabian Airlines from 2005 to date. Every year the service is worsening. This airline had newspapers on it’s early flights, but now the meal quantity is insufficient with the worst leg room and no inflight entertainment. Despite all this I have travelled with them for their punctuality and their flights are not even on time. SV779(9-5-19) is delayed for 3 hours and they are providing food refreshments for fasting passengers. This will be my last trip with them.

### "It was awful"
We flew from Cairo to Madrid and had a layover in Jeddah that was supposed to last 1.5 hours. Before take off, we received a message saying that our flight was delayed by 2 hours. When we arrived in Jeddah we received another text saying that we were not stuck in Jeddah, then another saying that it would be 6 hours. We could not find a person to speak with, anybody to tell us any information, or any member of the airline to comment on what was happening. It was awful.

### "Baggage handling was bad"
Not Verified |  Washington to Jeddah via Riyadh with Saudi Arabian Airlines. Entertainment screen was off the whole journey. The lounge is below standard of an international airline in terms of both food quality and the the interior. We could not find a prayer room in the lounge. Baggage handling was bad. I got two luggage supposed to be checked through. One came out, one checked through. The ground staff even did not want to check to their system, just saying it is often mistakenly handled by the ground staff.

### "the worst experience ever"
Riyadh to Amman. Worst service ever. We entered the aircraft preparing for the take off then the captain announced that the plane had a problem and it will take 10 to 15 minutes. We stayed inside the plane for 3 hours. That was the worst experience ever.

### "Very positively surprised"
Riyadh to Munich. Very positively surprised - excellent service and great seats (full flat business class seat). Excellent direct flight connection. It is during the day, so maybe less efficient for business travelers, but timing is very convenient. Meals are served fully flexibly both in terms of choice as well as timing.

### "Worst experience ever"
Muscat to Jeddah. Worst experience ever. Behavior of the air hostesses arrogant & not customer friendly. I was not asked for the meal in the flight whereas it had been charged in my ticket. Upon request for one veg meal, I was denied by saying that only beef and no veg meal left. No compensation for not giving food. It was really insulting while your neighbor passengers enjoying their meals and air hostess is arguing with you for not giving the meal.

### "worst stay on my life"
Manila to Jeddah. The flight was delayed for 24 hours, instant of looking for nearest flight with any other airline which is available because we are on the capital city of this country, they transfer us to a local hotel unfortunately it was the worst stay on my life. They served us with worst food and unhealthy with worst quality ever seen with no other choice to eat, in the hotel room they put every two persons together regardless of who is other person is, so you will end up to sleep with total stranger on your hotel room and other thing is they give us one card only for the room, how come if the other person with me in the room need to go out how he will do it. After this bad experience they should see the rating of this airline they should not considered this airline as 4 star airline. I think they will do it on all cities over the world I mean the accommodation quality and how they will act about the delayed flights.

### "No individual TV"
Johannesburg to Hyderabad via Jeddah, a pleasant flight. The landing and take off very smooth. No plug points for charging phone iPads, computer, etc a big no no. So we have to carry power banks which is airline safety hazard. No individual TV facilities available, so very tiring and boring on such a long flight Overall an excellent flight except the above.

### "cleanliness was disgusting"
Jeddah to Amman. Flight time got delayed for one hour without prior notice. Aircraft cleanliness and was disgusting, seat size was too small and aircraft was very old.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Madinah to Alexandria. Our flight number SV329 should take off from Madinah airport at 03:50, the company delayed it to 12:10 on flight number SV3331 without any care for the passengers. The real reason is to merge the two flights together (SV329 & SV3331) to fill the plane, they spoke that Borg El Arab air port in Alexandria has a bad weather but this not a true.

### "think we are beggars"
Jeddah to Karachi. Horribly treat customers, no manners, rude and think we are beggars. Long lines, very slow people just kept talking to each other while we have been in long lines waiting, customer security, desk service crew all same ill mannered rude.

### "Great experience"
Sharm El Sheikh to Dubai via Jeddah. Great experience. Full service in all flights, amazing legroom and really comfy seats. Staff correct and polite. All flights on time except last one, as our plain had a technical fault. It took Saudia less than an hour to have a replacement aircraft ready at the gate.

### "Never fly with this airline"
Worst airline ever. Worst and filthiest airport (Jeddah) on planet Earth - I've seen cleaner pigsties. This airline cannot even remotely compete with the likes of Emirates or Qatar. Never fly with this airline - pay a few hundred dollars more to fly with someone else, believe me, you will not regret it! Imagine taking a dirty rundown bus in a developing country which gets you from A to B - this is what you can expect here, except it's a plane instead of a bus.

### "I'd still recommend them"
London to Jeddah. Good points, No major delays, direct flight to Jeddah for pilgrims a big advantage, halal food and even a prayer section. Bad points, Old dated planes, toilets awful, running out of toiletries and paper. Entertainment screens hit and miss. Food quality below par, they take ages to give you the food thereby reducing the need to give you 2 full meals on a 6 hour journey. I don't mind airlines saving money if the ticket price is also low but for our trip the ticket price was the most premium, even though booked 9 months in advance, other airlines were cheaper but did not have a direct flight that I was looking for so had to book with Saudia. The culture there is generally quite arrogant. Shame as passengers relly lose out but I'd still recommend them due to their short flight time between London and Jeddah.

### "delayed by 45 mins"
Riyadh to Dubai. Flight delayed by 45 mins. For some strange reason the crew gives the earphones only after take off, especially when the flight is getting delayed

### "was worth the cheap price"
Singapore to Istanbul via Jeddah . Grabbed a relatively cheap flight price to Istanbul from Singapore through Skyscanner. The seat was much bigger than the seat I had I when I was flying in Lufthansa. I am a vegetarian, hence I preordered vegan meal. It was not the best airline food I tasted but was not bad. It was not very filling to be honest. The salad was the same for all my flights. Crew were rather nice and smiled at everyone despite race, religion or gender. Toilet wasn't the  cleanest aircraft toilet I have used but was tolerable. My baggage was delivered on one piece without any delays or damage. My flight from Singapore to Istanbul was delayed by 20 minutes but managed to land on time. My flight from Jeddah to Singapore, however, was delayed by an hour and landed 45 minutes later than the actual landing time. I could not change my meal preferences online hence had to call customer service to change my standard meal to a vegetarian meal. They promptly helped me to change without any issue. Overall, it was worth the cheap price. If I am on a budget, and the fares for Saudia is relatively cheaper than other airlines to my destination, I would definitely fly with Saudia again. However, If I am seeking a very very luxurious flight experience or need a very satisfying vegetarian meal onboard then its best to give Saudia a miss.

### "Delay after delay"
Saudi Arabian Airlines from New York JFK to Dhaka via Jeddah. Horrible customer service. Delay after delay. My initial layover was 7 hours, and then they increased it by 4 hours. And then on top of that another 3 hours. The attendants in the airport are of no help, and don’t listen to what we have to say or accommodate our needs. They didn’t offer to explain the services. To my understanding most airlines provide hotels for any 8-12 hour layover. You have to pay to sit in the lounge area. Otherwise you’ll be sitting on the floor. The representatives don’t even bother showing manners, they just avoid being asked any questions.

### "Delayed more than 5 hours"
Beirut to Jeddah. The worst flight. Delayed more than 5 hours. Staying inside the flight 2 hours and then getting out of it. Staff are not professional anymore. Bad service

### "Delay after delay"
Not Verified | Abu Dhabi to Riyadh. One of the worst airlines. Delay after delay every week for the same flight. These guys running the airline operations should be fired. First a couple of hours of delays, very old aircraft (seems from the 90s) and at arrival no sky bridge and we had to wait outside the plane for a bus to pick us up.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
New York to Dhaka via Riyadh. An old plane from Dhaka to Riyadh, from Riyadh to New York they provided a nicer one. We thought it was just for this time but when we came back, the same thing happened again. Good plane and services to / from New York and old plane and bad service. We think there is a discrimination between the service. The screen in front of my seat didn't work, seat doesn't recline. And the food wasn't so good as New York to Jeddah.

### "absolutely terrible airline"
New York to Abu Dhabi via Jeddah. Saudia is an absolutely terrible airline. On a stop-over in Jeddah I was humiliated by Saudia staff. In addition I had to buy a new ticket for an additional 1K USD. On a stopover from Jeddah, the gate for my connecting flight (business class ticket) closed before the 20 minutes deadline so I missed my connection. When I asked to be placed on the next flight I was mistreated. Saudia staff were not able to provide me with information on the next flight or rebook me. I couldn't rebook myself on another airline as I did not possess a visa to leave that terminal (which is only Saudia). Instead a staff group of 5-6 men laughed at me on numerous occasions. I was repeatedly told that the only solution was to sleep on the floor and wait for the next morning's flight (they never gave me an answer on why they couldn't rebook me now, but could magically do so for the next day). Several different staff members claimed to be the "manager" and sent me around in circles around the airport (I crossed security over 5 times) only to be sent back to the original "manger". This whole process took ~4 hours. The only solution to this ordeal and to get out of Jeddah was for my husband to spend another 1K to buy a new ticket (the Saudia staff in Jeddah were not even able to arrange for me to purchase a new ticket at the airport). I was finally able to get a "manager" to print my boarding pass, as I was also refused this service by several others. Upon arriving in the UAE, my luggage was lost for several days. This was a terrible experience, one that I would never expect from a Skyteam Alliance partner. Do yourself a favour and never use Saudia.

### "will never recommend Saudia"
Riyadh to Manila return. After the take off our entertainment screens did not work. After restarting it 3 times, the staff came and said sorry they cannot do anything and they cannot move us as the flight was full. Fine, a 9 hour flight with a 4y old with no entertainment and not even an apology. When it came to the meal before arrival, choice between fish or chicken were on the menu. But just our luck, they were out of chicken half way through the service and being allergic to fish I had to go hungry. That was they first experience - second experience came on the way back from Manila to Riyadh. First the seats we booked online with online check in has been moved as they changed aircraft. Again after take off, our entertainment screens did not work. When we asked the staff about it the response was sorry it does not work. I asked to speak to the supervisor onboard and after a long talk he finally moved us to another seat. Now the audio did not work. I spoke to the supervisor again and he promised to make the note to the airline. How must we not have entertainment for another 9 hour flight that we paid for? When the meal came again before arrival, again the chicken run out before it reached us. When we asked the staff to please see if there is any spare, she came back within 10 min with a chicken meal. She told us that this is for us, but it actually is for the staff. I told her to keep her staff meal and again no food. I will never recommend Saudia and never ever fly with them again. The staff attitude really need to change. We paid for the flight, entertainment and food.

### "This was the worst flight"
Colombo to Milan via Jeddah. This was the worst flight of my entire life. Starting with the fact that you couldn't pay 100 usd for a surfboard with a credit card, so I had to exit the airport to get cash, re-enter, go to their office. Jeddah airport where we spent 5 hours in transit was pure hell - people everywhere, even all over the floor, no place to sit, dirty and smelly, bathroom with mess all over the floor and people washing their feet in the wash basins. No way of knowing your gate and staff making fun of you for even trying to ask. It was a miracle we figured out where we needed to go and caught our flight. But the worst part was getting home, unpacking my precious surfboard and seeing the tail of it broken. I had packed it very well with extra protection on tail and nose aside from a heavy duty boardbag. Whoever handled it made a real effort to break it. Oh, and their customer service is non-existent - if you try to fill out the damage form online it doesn't work, if you try to call them, they just refer you back to the website. They didn't even know what a surfboard was when I called them -  a bunch on clowns taking people's money.

### "not any kind of entertainment"
Flight from Rome to Jeddah (4 hr 35 min flight): there was not any kind of entertainment or any kind of comforts such as earplugs, blanket or pillows. Flight from Jeddah to Jakarta (9 hr 55 min flight): the flight had a 2 hour delay, nobody informed us about that and even when we asked they did not provide any kind of answer. Finally, we are on board, my screen was not working so the cabin crew changed my seat. I moved and guess what, my table was not working. At that point, I gave up and I kept my seat sharing the table for eating with my boyfriend. During the flight, there were not enough blankets for all the passengers and they did not provide earplugs or a mask or anything to make the flight a bit more comfortable. Flight from Jakarta to Riyadh (8 hr 55 min). Of course, we started the boarding 2 hours late and of course, nobody apologized or informed us about the delayed. My screen was not working even this time, I informed the cabin crew, which did not do anything (even purpose me a different solution). My seat also had a hole in the front and about the general cleanliness was a total failure. The meals served was something unbelievable. Flight from Riyadh to Rome (6 hr 00 min). For a long flight, the company did not provide any kind of entertainment. Furthermore, the general screen was obviously broken. This does not allow me to watch the security video about the take-off. The sink in the bathroom was stuck and it was not possible to wash your hands.

### "average inflight Service"
Riyadh to Dubai. On time flight and average inflight Service. Food quality and variety needs improvement. Seats and overall aircraft condition was good since it was a newer aircraft.

### "poor management of delays"
Dubai to Riyadh . Bad communication and very old aircraft. Checkin was fine, however the flight was delayed by over 1hour and 30mins, apart from the SMS from Saudia, no further information from ground. Suddenly the on screens displayed final call and announced that flight is closing. This resulted in mass panic amongst all passengers trying to get to the gate. Very poor management of delays. Also the gate staff did not have an idea of no communications to passengers. To make things worse, they had a very old A330 with washrooms in poor condition.

### "flight postponed 4 times"
My flight from Jeddah to Madinah on 13 of August 2018 for Hajj has been postponed 4 times and till now 00:01 9n 14 August I am waiting in a very bad hall since my flight landed at 3 PM on 13 August. Saudi Arabian Airlines representative has provided a snack followed by meal saying that I can do nothing but meal. Bearing in our mind that hourly there is a flight from Jeddah to Madinah. However,instead of deferring each flight 1 hour late,they preferred to delay my flight more than 6 hours. I do not think that was a wise attitude towards pilgrims and the airline should think twice before changing any flight especially after giving the passenger a boarding pass in which the time to fly was writing as 21:35.

### "very good leg room"
Washington to Riyadh. It was a very good and comfortable flight. Friendly and attentive staff. The economy seats have a very good leg room. Well picked entertainments. And to be mentioned, the staff at the ground service in Washington were very nice.

### "unable to trace my luggage"
Manchester to Singapore via Jeddah. Saudia lost my luggage and say they are unable to trace any of my luggage. I cannot even complete the complaint form online because the form is unable to submit and an error message appears every time I try to contact any department. Very poor.

### "wont be using this airline again"
London to Manila via Jeddah. Jeddah airport was chaotic. Airline was already delayed from London, and Jeddah’s airport was so disorganised, you can see from screen that the next connecting flight going to Philippines is already boarding but no gate. So have to queued from where Filipinos are queuing, with people pushing and squeezing as staff didnt even bother to arrange the passengers according to their zones while boarding. Worst service ever, no blankets provided to passengers as they run out of stock, entertainment was worst as earplugs provided hurts my ear and the sound quality was ridiculous. You rather listen to the noisy sound of the plane rather than listening to it’s entertainment using its earplug provided. Worst nightmare came during luggage claim - waited for almost 2hrs only to find out that my luggage was left in London. Saudia staff in Philippines were terrible been promised that will be able to get my luggage the day after as they will put it on priority as told them that will be travelling again to HK, but got my luggage 3 days after.I wont be using this airline again for the stress it has given me. Never again.

### "we expect premium treatment"
Flew Jeddah to Dhaka with Saudi Arabian Airlines. This is the worst business class I have ever been on in my life. When I first got to the lounge I did not understand how in world this extremely disgusting lounge where I could hear mechanics drilling into an area and open construction going on ever be a business class lounge. Secondly the flight got delayed and no announcements were made on the matter, an announcement was made an hour later after which the passengers were told to immediately board the plane. My parents and I were stuffed into a bus with economy class passengers and faced extreme humiliation. A man was spitting and screaming in front of my fathers face while talking to his peers at a very uncomfortable distance whilst my mother was stuffed into a corner afraid that someone with wrong intentions would ‘brush’ past her. I on the other hand was being repeatedly smacked on the back with a mans heavy bag, who once again was very uncomfortably close to me, invading my personal space. Upon asking this man to move away he kept on doing the same thing. When we pay for business class we expect premium treatment not to be locked in a cage and humiliated or get headaches from the sound of construction. Never in my life of traveling all over the world have I seen such an atrocity of an airlines. Never again. If it was possible to give this experience 0 stars I would have.

### "will never fly with them again"
Worst flying and layover experience ever. I recently went to Cairo from Singapore (with a layover in Jeddah). The first flight (Singapore - Jeddah) was pretty okay, probably because we were less than 40 people. Once we landed in Jeddah, the nightmare began. Jeddah is probably the worst airport I have ever been to. Nobody can speak English. The Jeddah - Cairo flight was delayed. On TV, it was displayed that the boarding was taking place which was misleading. Once I was finally told that we could go (by another passenger who could speak both Arabic and English, the Saudia staff didn't help at all), we had to take a bus. We then arrived in front of the plane but we had to stay inside the bus for 20 minutes since the cleaning staff was still inside the plane. Once we landed in Cairo, it took about 1 hour to get the luggage. On the way back (from Cairo to Singapore via Jeddah), the flight experience was pretty terrible, especially on the Jeddah - Singapore part (via Kuala Lumpur). There was a lot of turbulence and kids were running, literally! The cabin staff didn't do anything at all to inform parents that the kids should remain seated. They didn't care at all. Once we finally landed in Singapore, I was told that my luggage had been lost along the way. I thought I was going to be the only one. We were only 18 people for the Kuala Lumpur - Singapore part. Out of the 18, I met 7 other people who did not get their baggage. They were coming from Paris, Istanbul and Cairo. I haven't heard from Saudia yet but I will never fly with them again.

### "cancelled my return flight"
Not Verified |  Never again! Do not fly with this airline regardless of how cheap it is. They cancelled my return flight from Jeddah to Manchester and put me on a later flight, much later. 14 hours stay over in Jeddah, the lounge was overcrowded, not enough beds, toilets downright filthy. The ground staff are arrogant, rude and very unhelpful. No information given, in fact they just waved me away with a gesture of their hands. However on a positive note the cabin crew were very good. Filled out a complaints form in Jeddah and was told somebody would contact me, I’m still waiting nearly 2 weeks later.

### "needs additional improvement"
Not Verified |  Riyadh to Dubai. Improvement during the last 6 months. Carrier used on weekly basis, despite the poor condition of the Airport, when you board it is another issue. Shiny aircraft despite its age however, the Cabin still need to be fixed -  aesthetic fixtures such as panels out of position or seat components are missing. Pleasant crew , consistent meal for a short haul. Entertainment rarely changed, almost same movies. Cabin cleanliness is not Skyteam standards. Saudia still needs additional improvement to compete with regional carriers.

### "Try to avoid this airline"
Jeddah to Chennai. Flew Saudia many times, primarily because its the only airline that operates direct flights on my route. When you fly Saudia, I believe there is no such thing as ‘customer service’. Impolite and unpleasant staff. Try to avoid this airline if you have any other option.

### "attentive flight attendants"
Pleasantly surprised by Saudi Arabian Airlines. New plane, interactive IFE, free whatsapp throughout the flight. Good meals and attentive flight attendants. Flight was delayed 1hr due to late inbound plane, apparently this is common with Saudia. Flight overall was good but arriving into JED is as usual chaotic. We were on the plane 30 mins after landing waiting for busses.

### "staff quality has improved"
Dammam to London via Riyadh. I had a very good service from the departure to arrival. Saudia has been improving a lot recently. The staff quality has improved. I departed from Dammam and had a connecting flight through Riyadh to London. The plane from Riyadh to London was brand new. The flight crew were very helpful though I feel they could have come around more often asking passengers how they were. They served a very weak breakfast for 8 hour flight and no snacks or lunch provided later on.. I felt as thought the cabin crew forgot because they spent a lot of time talking in the back. They have awfully young local male hostess who seemed to have spent a lot of time chatting to the female cabin crew for hours. They need to tighten up the customer service little bit more and they can stand out as one of the leading gulf / Middle East carriers.

### "service on this leg was shocking"
Please note this was the return leg of our trip from ISB to LHR. Outbound we went via Riyadh (better planes, service and transit). The trip begins well enough by friendly airport staff checking us in smoothly (pleasantly surprised for ISB). Boarding was announced over an hour in advance due to pilgrimage pax which was fairly chaotic due to the easily forgivable increased security. Once onboard SV 727 (HZ-AK15), it was apparent the plane was one of the older 773s on the Saudia fleet, with blue seats, a 3-4-3 configuration and the older type of IFE. Just before take-off, a disagreement broke out between some ladies and cabin staff. Ground staff were called as the ladies refused to sit next to myself as I was male. I offered to swap seats with one of their male family members and thought I got lucky with a nice emergency exit seat. Unfortunately, in this section of the plane, the IFE screens were non functional, just displaying the airline logo. Remotes were lit but inactive, basics like reading light and call buttons also refused to work. When brought to the attention (3 times) to staff, one said, sorry sir, unfortunately this happens all the time! Food was just about acceptable. The flight did operate perfectly to timetable though, slight delay in departure was made up during the flight to JED. I will cover the woeful experience at JED airport in a separate airport review. The JED to LHR leg was an overnight flight, SV113 on a 77W (HZ-AK18). The aircraft again was a little older than the RUH route but of 3-3-3 config. so the seating was more comfortable than the ISB plane. Whilst comfortable, the service on this leg was shocking. Staff were polite enough, however, stuck ruthlessly to their procedures. I would not sleep at all, and was rather peckish. I asked for something to eat like a banana, crisps, or even a biscuit (being diabetic) and was refused outright saying they do not carry snacks onboard! I am sure Business Class had ample supplies! Shocking. The best they could do was offer my main breakfast earlier (but then I would have to starve towards the end of the flight!). I found this really shocking. Upon arrival at LHR, I had to report a burst suitcase reported to Saudia ground staff. Initial attitude was to accuse me of overpacking, to which I simply said “its underweight, open it if you want.” I have filed a claim but not a single response. I would not recommend this airline if travelling via JED, if it wasn’t £1k GBP cheaper at the time of booking over EK or QR, I would not have bothered!

### "crew was terribly bored"
Istanbul to Jeddah. Flight departed 80 minutes later. Lost my connection in Jeddah. Food was tasteless. Drinks never served during the flight. Air crew was terribly bored not only to serve but to even smile as well. Apart the flatbed, not business class at all. At the end, the broke my luggage too, terrible service.

### "told to wait for 30 minutes"
Toronto to Dhaka via Jeddah. My kids wanted a drink and a small snacks. They went to the back galley and asked for a juice/snack but were told to wait for 30 minutes. They came back to seats disheartened. I could see similar requests were served for some other guests!

### "really was above my expectations"
Milan to Kuala Lumpur via Riyadh, and it really was above my expectations. Friendly check-in at Milan airport then on to the lounge. Relaxed boarding and the steward presented himself by name. Coffee and dates before take off. Menus were handed out with the choice of three entrées, main mail, and dessert. Both arabic and western bread served. Before take off a sms was received with the code for free wifi on both flights, this is tremendous value as most airlines charge for this even in business. The meals were all on demand, you could choose any time up till an hour before landing. Transfer at Riyadh, contrary to Jeddah is hassle free, with no queues, easy to find lounge. The Alfursan transit lounge at Riyadh airport is well equipped even for a longer transit time, nice sofas, relaxing chairs, working tables with computers, an abundant buffet with local and international specialities, with nice juices and excellent Arabian coffee. Though the aircraft announcements are made in a quite high noise level. A320 interior was a little bit worn, but with with excellent seat distance though not lie-flat beds. The Boeing 787 is top notch with full lie-flat beds. The inflight entertaining system is compared to another airlines quite limited, but there were Arabian films with English subtitles, films that we rarely see in Europe. Keeping in mind the competitive business class fares on Saudia and the hassle free flight, I will not hesitate to book Saudia again.

### "Very much exceeded my expectations"
Flew Istanbul to Kuala Lumpur via Jeddah with Saudi Arabian Airlines. Very much exceeded my expectations. For the low business class fare I paid I consider it to be outstanding value for money. The seating on both the A330 and 787 aircraft are fully flat and the cabin finishes very attractive. The 787 provides direct aisle access. Crew were friendly and attentive. Each flight I travelled on had WiFi. Food was pretty good. The menus could do with a little more variation and the main courses a little higher quality. And please, I know Saudia is a 'dry' airline and that is no problem for me but why can you not offer other drinks other than water, tea or coffee? Not on one of the four sectors was there a drinks service before the main meal. You take off, they do the meal order, there is a delay, then you are presented with your tray which automatically has a glass of water on it. Saudia should be offering/promoting high quality soft drinks in First/Business Class, fresh juices, smoothies, coconut water etc. Transit in JED is straight forward but the airport is a disgrace. I'm sure the terminal in Kabul or Mogadishu is more pleasant. It truly is hideous. Few food/beverage outlets, the toilets, don't get me started. Disgusting. The terminal is tiny and just people everywhere. The Saudia lounge in the terminal is just OK. Pretty small. Again, toilets are an issue (precisely two stalls - no urinals - in the gents so always a line up). Food was OK. However why the need to announce loudly every single flight that is boarding? It was disturbing after a couple hours. Saudia has the basics to be an amazing airline. The planes are great, the crews are good, the food and drink situation needs improvement but that isn't difficult to do. The worst aspect of Saudia is the Jeddah airport. Thankfully, a new airport terminal will open soon and when it does I wouldn't hesitate to fly Saudia again.

### "an average airline"
Dubai to Riyadh via Jeddah, a mix of A321/B777, overall an average airline nothing special. I was surprised that on their Int’l flight DXB-JED there was no onboard flight entertainment even if it was over 3 hrs flight. Food and service was average, planes were a mix of average airbus and fairly newer B777. Crew doing their job but nothing special.

### "food quality has gone downhill"
London Heathrow to Riyadh. Worst Business class in terms of food quality and in flight service. Boarding was ok after delay of 30mins, seating and layout of the new Boeing 777 of is great and now have full flatbed seats which is a plus. However the food quality has gone downhill very fast since the past few years. The flight attendants were asking passengers what they would like to have for dinner while I was in the prayer area in the back and obviously missed me. However when the food was being served I thought they were asking passengers at the time if what they would like to eat. Clearly no one served me anything which got me concerned resulting in me asking one of the flight attendants why am I not being served any food. Still no food or acknowledgement, then I decided to ask another attendant upon which the response was that I did not ask. Seriously! Anyway after a long wait I was served the food and upon slicing the piece of steak I found it stone cold inside. Again I had to summon one of the attendants and complain, who apologised and took the plate to heat it, when it finally arrived, it was very low quality. Also no amenity kit for Business Class passengers on this night flight, the response of the attendant was, that the kits were not loaded at London. Saudia can be a perfect airline if it improves its catering quality, variety and train its flight attendants to actually care about passengers.

### "transit was terrible"
We took a flight from Rome to Jakarta via Jeddah, and back. The flight from Rome to Jeddah (5h) was in a narrowbody aircraft. Small and without entertainment! The transit was terrible. The worst I ever been. Dirty, no seats for everyone, no restaurants - nothing. The flight from Jeddah to Jakarta had entertainment but our monitors were broken. 10h flight with screen broken. Thanks Netflix and Amazon prime video for letting me download the movies when I was still home. Also USB port was broken to charge my phone. Before departure I tried to contact the call center and I wasn't able to talk to anyone. So I tried to look for a live chat. There is no live chat. So I wrote an email. The answered that I had to call the contact center. I replied that I tried but no answer. They wrote me back few days later in Arabic! I tried to change my seat from the website. There was a recurring error on the system and it was not possible. Staff on the plane is nice. Food is fine. One last thing: the delayed the flights (go and back) 40 minutes. But at least they wrote the day before by email. In the past I used Saudi Airlines, and the service was really good. Now is really bad. If the price is low, go for it. But pay attention to your transit: if the transit is more than 3h and is in Jeddah take another airline.

### "I did not get my luggage"
Jeddah to Peshawar via Riyadh. I came from Jeddah on January 5, 2018 via Riyadh to Peshawar. At the airport of Peshawar I did not get my luggage, I wrote a complaint, the authorized person told me that I will receive it within 2 days. It is now 10th of January, today I came to the airport, the same situation. The most strange thing is that they told me that they had received the remaining bags of 27 December flight and my flight was on 5th January. Also, they had no idea when will they receive. I came for two weeks to Pakistan, so for this made my vocations one of the most stressful.

### "trip was delayed 2 times"
Jeddah to Dammam. Some of the crew are not professional, not even smiling. Breakfast was so poor, the aircraft was dirty, seats were also dirty. Poor entertainment system. The trip was delayed 2 times without prior notification, the worst ground service I have experienced. The legroom was good.

### "couldn't provide meal to my son"
Toronto to Lahore via Jeddah. My family was looking forward to travelling via Saudia but after their experience, never again. The flight was late (scheduled 12:40 pm takeoff, actual take off around 3:30 pm). Once inflight, the food started being served. The flight attendant provided a meal to my wife and daughter and my wife asked for one for my infant son as she knew he was hungry and wanted to eat. The flight attendant said that she couldn't provide the meal to my son as "we hadn't paid for the full seat". My wife could have paid for the meal then and there but the staff said that they had not paid for a full seat, is unacceptable. We had paid the asking price set for “under 2 year old” traveler. Shortly after this incident, my wife called a flight attendant and requested that my son’s baby bottle be warmed for 30 secs. The flight attendant declined and said that it was not possible to warm up anything. We have travelled on many flights internationally and crew has never declined to warm up a baby bottle. The frustration increases as Saudia left my wife and children’s luggage in Jeddah even though it was tagged to Lahore.

### "gave me a good nights sleep"
Riyadh to London Heathrow. New Boeing 777 aircraft with newer flatbed Business Class seats. Had comfortable seats which gave me a good nights sleep. Breakfast and overall catering for Business Class is poor and needs improvements to be on par with other Gulf airlines. The entertainment and free wifi was a plus.

### "ticket did not go into the system"
Riyadh to Paris. What a disappointment. I had a SkyPriority ticket and I really wonder what's the point when using this company. At the boarding gate, my ticket did not go into the system. The team could not get me into their system. I was stuck at the boarding gate 1 hour without being given explanations. I was taken my passport and my ticket, and left on the side for 1 hour. I almost missed my plane. We pay more to be SkyPriority and at the end that it does not work. Saudi Airlines team made no commercial gestures, they did not care.

### "service of the staff was great"
New York to Dhaka via Jeddah. The first flight was from JFK to Jeddah and it was 12 hours long. The plane left on time and arrived 30 minutes earlier in Jeddah. The food was awesome and the staff was nice as well. The landing was pretty smooth and the on flight entertainment system was decent. No headphones were supplied though. The second flight was from Jeddah to Dhaka and it was 6 hours long. The plane left Jeddah and arrived in Dhaka on time. The food was excellent once again and the service of the staff was great.

### "baggage was left on Jeddah"
Jeddah to Tunis. My baggage didn't arrive when we landed in Tunis, I, among other people, were waiting for our luggage. We were waiting for two hours from 9 am to 11am and then at the end, they told us that your baggage was left on Jeddah because it was heavy. It's the first time  I heard this. So they knew from the beginning that they left our luggage in Jeddah and no one told us - there was about 30 people waiting for their suitcases. I had to come back to Jeddah on Saturday because i'm working. So, they told me whether we leave it in Jeddah or ask someone to pick it for you. I was furious.

### "Jeddah Airport one of the worst places "
Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Jeddah. The inflight entertainment is so heavily censored to Saudi Arabian standards that there essentially isn't any. American sitcoms, for example, censor out all swearing, references to sex and alcohol, hugging, cuddling, kissing, and they even blur over any exposed flesh - e.g. shoulders and even lower legs. Same selection on all 4 of our flights as well, which totaled almost 30 hours. Very disappointing. The severity of the strict dress code on board is  ridiculous. As a woman you have to be completely covered, and in loose fitting clothing - so no leggings or tight trousers. I wore a floor length skirt and a long sleeved top, which is genuinely really quite uncomfortable for a long haul flight. My partner (male) wore shorts as it was a night flight and he wanted to be comfortable, he found out he wouldn't be allowed on board and so had to buy trousers. Jeddah Airport transfer lounge is genuinely one of the worst places I have ever been. It, in itself means you should seriously reconsider traveling with this airline, especially as a young western woman. The toilets are like an incoming apocalypse, honestly, it's nearly impossible to describe just how bad they are. There are essentially no shops, it's crowded to dangerous levels, to the extent that if there was a fire or an emergency of any type, people would be crushed to death. It's hard to even find a seat, and there is nowhere quiet to go, even the first class lounge is heaving. There are no restaurants, just very understocked, underwhelming cafes. The aircon and ventilation is appalling, it's stifling to overwhelming levels. Men and women also can't go through security together, so my partner and I got separated for a while, which was also quite distressing when I couldn't find him for half an hour. Honestly, avoid this place like the plague. The food and drink choice on board is limited as well. I understand the no-alcohol policy, however some more food options than 'beef and rice' or 'chicken and rice' would be welcome over the course of 6 meals! If you, like me, tend to get a bit dehydrated on flights, then make sure to take a couple of bottles of water on board as they are very stingy at providing drinks. On a positive note all four flights were on the brand new Boeing 787 planes, which were beautiful and seemed quite spacious in comparison to other long-haul flights I have been on.

### "was a very enjoyable flight"
I traveled from Addis Ababa to Beirut Via Riyadh on Saudia Airlines on September 13th 2017. It was a very enjoyable flight even with the four hour stop over in Riyadh. Saudia is a full service airline so we got meals and drinks. It did begin at 3:35am in the morning which is not the best time to catch a flight. All in all I will fly with them again.

### "learned that our luggage were lost"
Istanbul to Singapore via Jeddah. When we arrived to Singapore, we learned that our luggage was lost. Anyway, we went to lost and found to get information and fill the required forms. Responsible staff informed us that our luggage will be delivered within 24 hours but this was not true. We called hotline everyday to get information and also we checked global trace system everyday to get any good news and also we sent lots of e-mail to customer relations of SA airlines. As a summary, we used all channels that we can use. Of course, we could not get any response. We supposed that our luggage will not be able to be found anytime. We bought something to survive such as shoes, clothes and 4 days later suddenly our luggage was delivered to our hotel and we were shocked. Could you imagine such a period that you are in as a customer? They managed the process very unprofessional and amateur, no information, no compensation etc. One week later we went to airport for departure, we requested an authorized person to talk and explain. She came and gave us an e-mail address of her manager to send mail to demand our rights. Also they gave us 75USD for 1 person as compensation in the airport but they also said this is just for temporary action, company will pay also for 4 days delay and also purchasing items cost that you bought to survive. We came back to our country and sent e-mail to manager and she said that 'according to our policy, is to give 75$ US or equivalent in local currency for the delay of the baggage and for the inconvenience of our guests'. My ticket has just 1 stop in Jeddah but after Jeddah, we did not go to Singapore directly. First, we went to Kuala Lumpur then Singapore. In Kuala Lumpur, we were not allowed to go out from the plane just waited for one hour for new passengers.

### "staff helpful, kind and friendly"
Nairobi to Toronto via Jeddah. First time flying Saudi Airlines even though most of the reviews I read about them were not good I still decided to try it out. Their staff are very helpful, kind and friendly, not very strict on luggage weight they wont mind the extra 2 kilos unlike other airlines. Flight was clean and had rooms to perform prayers. Decent food. Inflight entertainment was not bad either. The only issue I had with my flight was at Jeddah airport. Probably the worst airport I have visited. No communication on flight information, rude staff, no proper seating area, very crowded, barely any duty free shopping stores, only 3 coffee shops, no WiFi. If you have more then 3 hours stop over I suggest you look for a different airline.

### "doesn't have entertainment"
I'm so disappointed with my last experience with Saudi Airlines from Riyadh to Jakarta. On board of the outbound flight I discovered the malfunction of the entertainment system, so I told the flight attendant and informed him about the issue but he told me that after the airplane takeoff the system will be restarted. After takeoff nothing happened and it turned out that 50% of the airplane seat doesn't have entertainment. For 9 hours flight you are setting face-to-face with the seat in front of you. In the return flight from Jakarta, the flight was delayed 1 hour but in the flight no entertainment at all for all seats, some peopled argued with the flight attendants but they had nothing to do with it.

### "Hospitable and friendly staff"
We flew Business to Jeddah in Economy and return from Madinah to Manchester. Excellent service, friendly check-in and on-board staff. Extremely comfortable seats in Business and nice seats in Economy Class. Prayer Room and Toilets well-maintained and convenient. Hospitable and friendly staff.

### "needs to update its fleet"
Saudia needs to update its aircraft fleet. Check-in was very long and unorganised, even the dedicated Business desk was poorly manned and had long queues. Had to use the Economy desk instead. Used the fast track at IST which made a life little easy. Takeoff was on-time. Pre take-of drinks and dates were of good quality. Food was ok for Business class, which was essentially economy meal presented in chinaware. Generally, I feel Saudia needs to get rid of old A330s' and 777s as they are starting to show their age. The Business seats on the A330-300 are not fully lie flat unlike its competitor airlines.

### "the service on board was average"
Flew Riyadh to Istanbul. Nightmare check-in at RUH and average service on board. Took almost 1 hour 30 mins waiting in the check-in queue at King Khalid International Airport (RUH). Took off on time, however the service on board was average. Food was mediocre at best, desserts are not what they used to be in Economy with Saudia. Standards in catering have slipped during the last 3 years. The in flight entertainment needs to be kept updated. I have been seeing the same music albums and songs for the past year on board all aircraft with IFE Screens.

### "it is a good-sized meal"
London Heathrow to Tabuk via Riyadh. I have been a Gold Alfursan member (SkyTeam Elite+) for the past 6 years and most of my flights are with  Saudia. At T4 check-in was swift and the pass for the excellent SkyTeam lounge was handed to me. Sky Priority now means that you can use the VIP security channel, so it’s a very quick process to get scanned and into the lounge where a full English breakfast was being served. London to Riyadh was on their new 777-300ER. This plane has the new First Suites and the 1-2-1 Business Class configuration. However, I was in economy and the last row only has 2 seats near the window. Boarding was early and efficient. Cabin Crew greeted me with smiles. The blanket and pillow were on the seat. Economy seat 59A is at the rear of the plane and I was lucky enough not to have anyone beside me despite a busy flight. Shortly after take-off there was a choice of fruit juice and lunch was served. Saudia still offer metal cutlery. The chicken salad starter was delicious and I chose the chicken biryani (a favourite of mine on Saudia) as it is a good-sized meal and succulent chicken. This came with a warmed bread roll and butter. The dessert was a small piece of chocolate cake. The two other hot meal choices were beef with vegetables and fish. A small bottle of water was given with the lunch. Although I use my iPad to watch films and TV on, the inflight entertainment system would also have kept me very happy with the range of choices and some box sets of USA shows. The entertainment is edited with blurred blobs covering up bare arms and legs on females. The map feature is excellent. USB sockets to charge phones and there is a multi-socket under the seat that takes various plugs. Recline is very good as the seat back reclines and the seat itself moves slightly forward. The prayer room is at the back so this tends to make for a quieter journey. The flight crew were attentive throughout and if not visible, they did answer calls and brought drinks. 90 minutes before landing, a small tray with two finger sandwiches, a packet of Scottish biscuits, water and a cup for tea/coffee was given out. The flight landed 25 minutes early. Disembarkation in Riyadh was swift (even though I was at the back) and I had no immigration queue and was out in the baggage hall before any cases arrived. Riyadh now operates a fixed fee system if you want an assistant for your trolley (SAR15 or £3). My luggage appeared quite quickly and I headed for the inter-terminal bus as the new domestic terminal is further away. It is a little chaotic getting the bus with the traffic, but it all seems to work. The new Terminal 5 is beautiful. As my luggage was already tagged for Tabuk at Heathrow, the assistant just put it straight onto the conveyor. Once through security I headed for the new Alfursan Lounge which is a wonderful space to relax. There is s self-service buffet with many choices of hot and cold dishes as well as cakes and prepared fruit. There’s a wide choice of cold drinks and the usual coffee machine. The terminal has various coffee shops and fast food choices. The Tabuk flight was on a 5-year old A321.

### "I was really disappointed"
Madinah to Delhi via Riyadh in December 2016. The flight took off on time from Madinah, but we had to wait for quite sometime on tarmac in Riyadh with no obvious reason for the delay. The food was horrible. I was sitting in the first row and the screen was stuck below the armrest. Somehow the crew managed to retrieve it, but the sound quality was very bad. Cabin crew was helpful though. I was really disappointed by the Saudi Arabian Airlines experience. They are charging a hefty sum for their flights, but disregard customer satisfaction. Definitely will opt for other Gulf airlines over Saudia next time.

### "might use in future"
Jeddah to Jakarta. It was a relief to get on this plane after the chaotic check-in. Food generally acceptable but only 2 drinks offered on a 9 hour flight. In flight entertainment is excellent but women's exposed skin is blurred by the censors for some odd reason. Toilets fairly dirty and the flush buttons were defective in 2 toilets and had random stickers placed upon them. Prayer zone at the back of the plane is fantastic. Cheap price for a single out of Jeddah via Jakarta to Bangkok so might use in future.

### "really needs to up their game"
Saudi Arabian Airlines really needs to up their game in terms of service and in terms of quality of the aircraft from Jeddah to Johannesburg and back. We always get the old aircraft, uncomfortable seats, half of them broken, also in flight entertainment touch screens are old, dirty and most do not even work, same with the headphones. Lack of drinks on the flight also, we were given a snack with apple juice and then a breakfast with orange juice, what about those who don't drink juices, or who want a different flavour? No selection or choice. The aircraft used on the Jeddah to Istanbul route is so much smarter, newer screens, even the cabin crew tend to be more friendly, maybe this is because they also on a smarter more advanced plane.

### "much better than expected"
Manchester to Jeddah return. The experience was much better than expected. The airline have to focus on staff customer care training if it wants to compete with likes of Emirates. The aircraft were good. The entertainment system was average. Food was fine and comfort was good. I also took a domestic Saudia flight from Madinah to Jeddah and this was delayed for over 4 hours. That put me off although delays do happen with all airlines. I will use this airline again but wont be my first preference.

### "frequently delaying flights"
Saudi Arabian Airlines is frequently delaying flights by 2+ hours especially from Dammam to Jeddah and vice versa. Flight gets delayed, then the boarding time crosses the departure time and then they announce boarding. I mean what's going on? Is this really meeting modern standards? You can't even avoid it as other airlines are even worse than this.

### "Overall I had good experience"
We flew from Jeddah to Geneva the flight was full, we had around 30 minutes delay. The cabin crews were so helpful, the flight was around 5 hours and we had only one meal at the beginning as breakfast and snacks before landing. The seats were in good size and comfortable, inflight entertainment were updated and has some new Hollywood movies. Overall I had good experience.

### "crew seemed to be tired"
❎ Unverified |  Saudia flight SV1043 was from Riyadh to Jeddah on on Airbus 330-300. We departed late due to late arrival of aircraft. No entertainment system on-board. We were served by a cold sandwich and tea/coffee. The crew seemed to be tired but tried to hide that. The ground services and airport facilities in King Khalid International Airport are excellent.

### "asked us to sit somewhere else"
Jeddah to Dammam. Seat assignment on my boarding pass meant nothing as the assigned seat is not yours until you physically sit on it. Very bad experience on flight SV1114 from JED to DMM. A couple of people took our assigned seats and refused to move. The crew did nothing to move the couple. After 15 minutes of waiting for them to do the right thing, they asked us to sit somewhere else. In addition to the above, the entertainment system on my seat kept freezing.

### "seats were very comfortable"
Flew from Doha to Jeddah. I selected Saudi Arabian because they were part of the SkyTeam Alliance and their business class fare was unbeatable, but I was pleasantly surprised on how good their business class was. The seats were very comfortable and wide, their entertainment system though dated with much older programs worked quite well and had a few classics. There were three meal choices on the outbound flight, I choose the Chicken with mushroom sauce, the portions were generous and the flavor was good. The cabin staff were not overly friendly but not bad, the return plane was a newer A320 with somewhat larger screens and more choices on the entertainment system. Breakfast was served with a very bland omelette I am afraid to say, but I can't complain as I saved a lot on the choice and I would always put them first on this route.

### "do not plan flying them again"
Manila to Johannesburg via Jeddah. While Saudi may have the lowest fare, be prepared to feel the difference. Our 10+ hour flight had no entertainment. Wifi as a substitute was not offered to economy class passengers. We were not provided any toiletries, eye masks, toothpaste etc. The food options for dinner were fish or tofu. Jeddah airport itself is awful and the ground staff are rude (side note if you are a smoker there is only a smoking area available to first or business class passengers and the ground staff). If you do decide to fly with them try to get a layover of less than 3 hours. I've had a total of 4 flights with the airline thus far and I do not plan flying with them again.

### "new lounge policy is nonsense"
Jeddah to Riyadh with Saudi Arabian Airlines. New lounge policy for Gold Al Fursan members for domestic flights is just a nonsense. You cannot even have your kid with you, you are allowed but not your children. Better just to stop the service or change the name of the lounge.

### "everything was top-notch"
Toronto to Kuwait via Riyadh. I absolutely loved my experience. Huge movie selection, comfortable seat, nice cabin staff, great food, everything was top-notch to me. I'd definitely fly with Saudia again! The price of the ticket was also beyond incredible for the length of the trip. People must keep an eye on this airline for it has incredible price deals!

### "Cabin crew: nice, efficient and smiling"
I knew Saudia was part of Skyteam, so when I saw this Milan - Kuala Lumpur - Singapore - Milan flight at an incredibly low price I instantly booked. Then, as the departure date approached, I gave a look to the reviews and I got quite alarmed from the amount of negative ones. Now, after 4 flights, I decided to spend a few minutes to write a review, which I don't usually do, but I feel the company fully deserves it: Booking was quick and easy, no problem whatsoever. A320 for the short flight, Boeing 777ER for the long leg. Both new, clean, in perfect condition. True, the A320 didn't have the personal screen but there is a wifi service, working with a dedicated app, with a great selection of movies, games, flight info etc. Cabin crew were nice, efficient and smiling. Food was very good, far better than most European companies and definitely than all American ones. Aircraft were perfectly clean, unfortunately its other passengers that don't know how to use a bathroom! Crew were even entering the toilets from time to time to flush and to spray some perfume. Flight punctuality just perfect, we even landed 15 mins ahead of schedule in MXP. Leg room: unless you're a NBA player you'll have plenty. All in all, I found Saudia far better than any American company I've flown with, and easily at the level of the various BA/AF/KLM and at half the price, though. The only problem can be the layover in Jeddah, more than 2-3 hours in that place can be very taxing. Apparently, a new airport is bound to open but it's unclear when. However, this isn't Saudia's fault. (Ps. they even give you meal vouchers to use at JED, I've rarely seen other companies do so).

### "no empathy for passengers"
Dammam to New York via Riyadh with Saudi Arabian Airlines. The flight from Dammam to Riyadh was late. The wait at Riyadh for luggage was delayed. I was exhausted standing at the cold baggage claim area from 1:30 to 2:30 am. When I boarded the flight to New York at 5 am I fell asleep right away. I had been up all night. Soon thereafter a staff member kept on yelling 'Madam' repatedly till she woke me up. She was serving breakfast. After that I couldn't get back to sleep for the rest of the flight. I wish she had let me sleep. The journey was so exhausting that I promptly fell sick after arriving. Some airlines give a tag Do Not Disturb for a passenger to put up. No empathy for passengers.

### "best value for money"
Guangzhou to Paris CDG via Riyadh with Saudi Arabian Airlines. Best value for money, business class ticket bought at the incredible price of almost an economy fare. On the leg to and from Paris, latest seat with direct aisle access. Friendly and relaxed cabin crew. Saudia makes business class accessible to almost all budgets but do not expect any alcohol.

### "lack of inflight entertainment"
Frankfurt to Jeddah via Medina. Punctual flight, but I was amazed of the lack of inflight entertainment offered, no seatback touch screens! Come on Saudia this is 2017. Food was of a good standard, service was reasonable. The cleanliness of the toilets, shown that the attendants to little or no notice of the facilities.

### "had to wait 14 hours in Jeddah Airport"
Paris to Jakarta via Jeddah. Saudi Arabian Airlines and edreams couldn't figure out to give me the right ticket, so in the end I had only 45 minutes in Jeddah to transit. As the flight from Paris was delayed by one hour, obviously I missed this transit flight. I kept telling staff both at Paris check-in and on the flight that I had a short transit and asked them to help, but all just shook it off as if they don't care. In the end I had to wait 14 hours in Jeddah Airport overnight. When I arrived, frustrated and pregnant, the staff laughed at me. After much complaining they finally gave me access to the first class lounge. The actual flight itself was below mediocre, it was dirty and with poor entertainment systems.

### "way above expectation"
Singapore to Cairo via Jeddah with Saudi Arabian Airlines. There were few passengers on this route Singapore to Jeddah this time of the year so I managed to have whole row by myself. Crews are polite and attentive. Food served was above standard in economy class. The seafood meal offered was the best I ever had, big prawns. Unlike other airlines that serve one meal and one snack, they serve 2 full meals, really impressive. Aircraft cabin ok, a bit dated. Punctual in departure and arrival. In Jeddah airport, no passenger loading bridge so shuttle bus was used to ferry passengers. The second segment from Jeddah to Cairo was cancelled and all affected passengers were pushed to the next flight. I guess its their way to maximise load factor otherwise both flights half full. Meal was served for this short haul, again good food standard. We arrived ahead of schedule in Cairo. For the price that I paid, I got a product that was way above expectation. Will definitely fly with them again. Hope they do daily flight to Singapore and hope that they have good connection time to Cairo and Sharm.

### "pleasant flight on both legs
London Heathrow to Riyadh return. Pleasant flight on both legs. Boarded and arrived on time and landed earlier than scheduled. This might be down to the low passenger numbers on board the flights due to it being a weekend. Food was enjoyable and served at the right time. Had a seat with extra legroom so this made a huge difference.

### "not friendly but helpful"
New York to Singapore via Jeddah with Saudi Arabian Airlines. 3 out of 4 legs the aircraft was empty hence there was enough free seats to sleep. IFE was not good. Same movies for several months and heavely censored that it was sometimes hard to follow the plot. Food was ok. Kudos for the NY legs that have an open buffet midflight to help yourself for drinks, snacks and sandwiches. Staff not friendly but nevertheless helpful. Airport staff not helpful. I guess you get what you pay for. No wonder the planes go empty, besides the terrible airport from hell that Jeddah is.

### "I was disappointed"
London to Mumbai via Jeddah with Saudi Arabian Airline. From London to Jeddah - a clean aircraft with big seats and good quality screen. A variety of movies and friendly staff. After landing a 9-hour transit in Jeddah, the dirtiest and worst airport before my flight to Mumbai. A small aircaft, unfriendly staff, when asked for an eyemask I was told we don't give them on short flights but when I went on the same route Mumbai - Jeddah - London I was given one. The airraft was dirty, oily windows, seat leather torn, entertainment was not upto the mark with same old movies for the last 2 months. Overall, only the European flight was of good quality. Despite having paid a good amount, I was disappointed.

### "took 14 hrs that should take 5:30"
Flight from Riyadh to Munich took 14 hrs on a flight that should take 5:30. Left Riyadh 30 mins late, but when we got to Munich, after circling for 1 hr we were diverted to Geneva apparently due to low cloud (although no other incoming flights were diverted that day). We then spent 5 hrs without being allowed to leave the plane at Geneva Airport before another pilot was found to take us to Munich. Explanations were not given, and crew (when asked) just kept telling us that we would leave Geneva within the next hour. In all this time all we were offered was 1 drink of Juice. Other than this, the plane was very old and there is no Video player in economy (even though Saudi air website says all mid-haul planes have video). Good news is legroom was quite good. No explanation or compensation has been provided.

### "motivation to provide good service"
Jeddah to Singapore via Riyadh. Both outbound and inbound flights with very minimal passengers in the economy section. However, I sensed the motivation from the crew to provide good service. The plane is clean, except for some passengers who didn't know how to dispense their used paper towels. Meals are satisfying, although the bread rolls tend to be tough. IFE is sufficient for the duration of the flight. Because of the lack of passengers, I was able to sleep stretched fully on one row which allowed me to arrive refreshed after the flight. Tried to buy from their inflight sales on my way to Singapore as a birthday gift to my friend but was told that the person responsible was not available to accept sales (perhaps due to the fact that we are less than an hour before landing). With this experience (my first time after more than 20 years), I would consider flying Saudia again. But the Saudia Terminal (South) is another story.

### "hot meal was delicious"
The flight was from Jeddah to Istanbul with Saudi Arabian Airlines. A330-300 old equipment. The crew was friendly and ready for service. The hot meal was delicious. Take off and landing were smooth. We faced a problem with the toilet cleaning. No entertainment.

### "unbeatable value for money"
I did the very same return trip twice in under 6 months (Paris CDG to Manila via Jeddah). All aircraft and seats good, mainly the brand new 787. Flights on time. Service and meals decent. Overall, an unbeatable value for money, providing you accept to fly the Saudi folk way (no alcohol, prayers before take off, censored or partly blurred scenes on movies). One major drawback anyway is the stop in Jeddah, that comes as the most pitiful joke ever. Only good thing is the lounge, large, well stocked, good food (especially the warm food options). All the rest is a nightmare, zero gangways so access to/from planes is exclusively by bus, incompetent and careless ground staff and officers, no priority boarding, all passengers crammed into a small pre-boarding room, everyone jostling. Make yourself ready for the experience.

### "overall experience is average"
Cairo to Jeddah. Aircraft cabin is average, inflight entertainment screen was not working. Cabin crew and the meal served were average, but the washrooms were dirty. The overall experience is average, would recommend flying on Saudi Arabian Airlines compared to other flights in this route.

### "flight was a disaster to me"
Khartoum to Toronto via Jeddah. I was in the Saudi flight 450 from Khartoum to Jeddah on Sept 11, 2016. We had to stay at Jeddah King Abdulaziz airport for about 9 hours. We asked the airline employees to take us to hotel but they refused. The airport was crowded and I had to stand for 3 hours because they were no empty seats. There were about 5 washrooms only for men. The airline staff at the airport told us they cannot take us to a hotel because we not allowed to leave the airport and there is no hotel in the airport. We told them if you cannot control the airport at least you have a control over your scheduling process. Employees as well as security at that airport were not friendly at all. That flight was a disaster to me and my family and I don't advise anyone to experience the same.

### "the flight itself was fine"
Domestic Saudi Arabian Airlines flight from Riyadh to Hail (under one hour). Flew from the new Terminal 5 (which is quite nice but can involve long walks). Doors closed and armed and then a few minutes later the doors were disarmed. Nothing happened and there was no announcement until about 25 minutes later. Told that a passenger had just received a phone call about a death in the family and they were waiting to let him off. Total delay of about 50 minutes. The flight itself was fine. The aircraft was fairly new and clean. The service - a drinks run - was fine and the (Filipina) attendants actually smiled. Apart from the delay, nothing negative.

### "a wonderful experience"
Geneva to Manila via Jeddah. A wonderful experience, the food was great, service is standard. The airport terminal is small just because under renovation, the duty free is close etc except the coffee shops but it's not a big deal for us. The airplane is clean. Based on our experience we are satisfied and happy. I heard soon the new Jeddah airport will be open. It is our first time to flew with Saudi but definitely it's not the last.

### "pleasant flight attendants"
Paris to Mumbai via Jeddah. Surprisingly, the new Boeing 787 was full, as Jeddah seems to be used as a hub, offering good connections to Manila or Colombo (no flight to Ryiadh today). Smiling crew, IFE quite easy to use, and average food, but as a Skyteam frequent flyer, I have my dinner in the lounge. Despite the long connection time, a good experience although the Boeing 777 used on the JED-BOM segment has known better days (once again, pleasant flight attendants).

### "the experience was good"
London to Riyadh in economy. Daytime flight on a B777-368. Check-in was reasonably fast but was unhappy to see a Saudi being pulled out of the line to check in before others. Don't expect that at Heathrow and, in the absence of a disability or great age (and it was), the airline should be ashamed of the staff who did this. The flight itself was pretty much on time and uneventful. Had a bulkhead seat and discovered that there were no power points (or at least none that I could find). Special meal ordered and delivered. As on the outbound flight, the meal was fine but could have been a bit more substantial. There was turbulence over the Alps and the pilots appeared to be making course alterations to minimise it. The plane skidded a bit on landing and there appeared to be no cross wind. Apart from the check in experience, the experience was good. Would I use again? Yes.

### "portions could have been larger"
Flew Riyadh to London in economy class. Check-in was a breeze and far quicker than expected on the day before Eid. Boeing 777 which was two years old, as opposed to BAs aircraft on this route which are over 15 years old. The flight left within 30 minutes of the planned departure. It was a morning flight and food (lunch) was served about an hour and a half after take-off. Did not use the IFE as I find the screens too small and the headphones terrible. Did like the at seat USB power port. Special meal ordered and this was delivered. The meal was fine but the portions could have been larger. Apart from meal service, I had no interaction with the cabin crew but they did bid me a friendly goodbye on leaving. The toilets remained reasonably clean throughout. The only negative comment I would make is that the crew closed the shades after lunch so that some people could sleep. This was a daytime flight, so perhaps those that wanted to sleep should have been given eye shades. The luggage only arrived at the belt after about 45 minutes of waiting (after the immigration rituals) - that was not down to Saudia, but to good old Heathrow. Would I chose Saudi Arabian Airlines again? Yes.

### "a very nice dinner was served"
Jeddah to Dubai. I had done online check in and printed my boarding pass. As I had no luggage I was able to go straight ot the gate and thus avoid the terrible status of Jeddah airport, something I never relish. The state of the airport is shameful and I could not find any power outlet to charge my phone. WiFi was non existent. Luckily all of this was sorted out in flight. The plane had power at each and every seat and the rear part of the cabin was totally empty. We took off right on time and a very nice dinner was served giving us a choice of 3 options in economy which included lamb, chicken and fish. service was good and IFE was not bad either. The best part was the prayer room at the rear end which was really helpful for those who wanted to pray. We landed on time and sadly it took us over an hour to come out of busy busy Dubai airport.

### "plane was not wholly clean"
Tunis to Kuala Lumpur via Jeddah. The plane was not wholly clean. I was glad to see a prayer space on-board but it was small and unclean. Flight attendants were not smiley, no PTV screen. Jeddah Airport was chaos, no direction signs, staff were not helpful, only one restaurant and one café. Employees were shouting at an African family in the gates area. Plane was far from the terminal and we needed to use a bus in to reach the aircraft.

### "budget airline at premium prices2
Manila to Jeddah with Saudi Arabian Airlines and the airline lived up to its reputation. Paid Business class prices and got nothing more than a bigger seat. The inflight entertainment did not work. The priority boarding did not happen. Luggage came off the aircraft Last. 1 hour 30 minutes after landing at Jeddah. Sadly I fly a lot with this company as they are the only option from Jeddah on my routes and it is always the same. Last flight my seat was broken. Budget airline at premium prices.

### "have to improve the Customer Service"
I flew on Saudia last year in September from Toronto to Karachi via Jeddah. Flight was smooth with no issues at all. Cabin Crew were friendly and helpful. All went fine until we reached Jeddah. My layover was about 6 hours. Waiting Lounge was so full that you would hardly find a seat. I was looking for a Saudi Arabian Airlines counter to get a free meal Voucher since the layover was quite long. But to my surprise there was no such counter after clearing security. I wanted to talk to a supervisor but an employee informed me that I had to go out of the airport to reach the office. Staff at the airport were rude. I fly on Emirates and Etihad and find their facilities/staff are much more cooperative then at Jeddah Airport. Saudia really have to improve the Customer Service aspect to earn any good ratings.

### "recommend if you short on budget"
I flew to Madrid from Mumbai via Riyadh with Saudi Arabian Airlines. I chose this flight as it was comparitely cheaper and had a short lay-over time. The planes were a bit old and not well maintained. But the flight was very smooth and didnt have any major turbulence. The food was excellent as it was Indian food. Also, the flight was mostly on time for all the routes except a 30 min delay which was eventually covered up. Cheap and  less cancellation or rescheduling fees. great Indian Food, good Entertainment Options. Aircraft interior was not maintained well. Would recommend if you are short on your budget and if you get a less layover time.

### "expected much more"
It was a pretty decent flight from Jeddah to Dammam with Saudi Arabian Airlines. It was only a 2 hr flight and it landed 10 mins early. Seats were very good. The IFE was not working properly and the aircraft was very poorly maintained. It had the safety card of another aircraft and some seats did not even have the monthly magazine. A juice and sandwiches were served which were OK. The crew were very friendly. Overall I expected much more from this flight.

### "had a very great time"
Lahore to New York via Riyadh and Jeddah. I read all the reviews about Saudia Airlines which were not so good, but still decided to board this flight with my family as the tickets were comparatively cheaper than every other airline. To my astonishment, I had a very great time with Saudia Airline. Flight from Lahore to Riyadh and then from Riyadh to Jeddah was just ok. Screens were turned off in respect of the people going for Hajj which is great. And then from Jeddah to New York was an excellent quality plane and with bigger screens and more seat space than Emirates. The best thing about this airline is that you get your Pakistani/Indian Style food. Every one has its own preference. So if you like Pastas, Noodles, and many other dishes then you might prefer other airlines. But if you are a simple person whom likes simple desi food, then this airline is best for you. Many seats were empty so I had full 3 seats to use. I had the best mango juice of my life here. And a lot of fruit and sandwiches were also provided. I just know about my experience and I enjoyed a lot. I would say, this airline is not that much bad which these reviews express.

### "satisfied with this flight"
Jeddah to Washington DC was my first long haul flight with Saudia since 2009, I was amazed with the big change and development. We had a delay of 30 minutes prior to departure that was caused by immigration for some of the passengers, and the captain apologised to the passengers. The seat in the economy class was comfortable, clean toilets during the flight, we had 2 meals in the flight -  breakfast after departure and Lunch 2 hours before landing and a choice of snacks and juice provided inbetween beside the galley. IFE has a lot of choices, latest Hollywood movies, documentary movies, Arabic and foreign programs and films in different languages. I got my seafood meal as requested in the booking online, I purchased a 15 minuets in-flight internet that costs 5USD, and the speed looks good to me. Overall I was satisfied with this flight.

### "enjoyable and comfortable"
I have found the trip from Jeddah to Los Angeles to be very enjoyable and comfortable. I really recommend the airlines for anyone trying to travel to Saudi Arabia. The only thing i find annoying is the chess game for seating, that we play everytime before the aircraft take off, especially for families. I think in future ground services should choose seats for them next to each other instead of wasting the time before the aircraft take off.

### "excellent service all round"
Saudi Arabian Airlines from London to Jeddah, and returning was from Medina to Londonv ia Jeddah. We were a four passenger and we loved every single minute with airline. Brand new plane, an excellent service all round. In both legs of our journey plane was on time. I will fly With this airline in near future.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
London to Jeddah with Saudi Arabian Airlines and after reading the reviews I was pleasantly surprised. Going out was an older aircraft but coming back was a very new one with full reclining beds. Food was great. Jeddah airport is chaos and boarding was very slow as they recheck everyone's visa again before allowing you on one of the buses. The inflight entertainment isn't of the standard you would expect on other airlines and as mentioned before, the censorship is bizarre. They had blurred out the knees of a girl in an American comedy but in my hotel in Jeddah they were showing fifty shades of grey uncensored! Go figure.

### "long-haul flights are great"
New York to Riyadh, and as a loyal member of the Alfursan program, I know which Saudi Arabian Airlines flights I'll be enjoying, and which ones I won't. As a general rule, Saudi long-haul flights are great while short-hauls are more often hit or miss. Saudi Arabian Airlines newer aircraft such as the Boeing 777s and A330s are in very good condition and the seats are among the best in the sky, older aircraft may or may not be as good. The only problems I seem to always have are the absence of priority lanes when boarding, the very heavily censored IFE (ridiculously I'd say), and the crew's relaxed enforcement of safety precautions. I enjoy traveling to Europe and North America on Saudia, not so much when on other routes.

### "poor inflight meal"
Saudi Arabian Airlines flight from Medina to Riyadh was more than an hour late. Poor inflight meal on all domestic flights. Seats comfortable for sitting and was even able to take a nap. Crew were helpful and aircraft seemed to be new. No IFE system at all on the flight from Medina to Riyadh.

### "would certainly fly again"
I fly regularly between Dubai and Riyadh but this was the first time on Saudi Arabian Airlines and I was apprehensive given the press they had received. However, I was pleasantly surprised as the aircraft, although a little aged, was clean, well maintained, comfortable and on time (departure and arrival). The online check-in was smooth with no issues. Boarding was a little slow but that was more down to overly laden passengers than any fault of the cabin crew. The crew were polite and attentive even with a full meal service in a 1.5 hour flight. The economy seats were very comfortable. The breakfast was an omelette with mushrooms and caremelised onions which was edible - just! Although I don't know many airlines at all that can produce a righteous omelette for economy class breakfast so SV get a "pass" on that one. The economy seats were very comfortable in faux leather and the pitch was way better than EK or FZ. Went to the toilet prior to landing and all was clean, tidy and as it should be. All in all, I would certainly fly Saudi Arabian Airlines on this sector again.

### "On board service recommended"
Damman to Dubai in economy class with Saudi Arabian Airlines after connecting from KLM flight from Amsterdam. Transfer process at Damman virtually nonexistent and poorly organized, clearly not a common transfer point. No boarding announcement made, Sky Priority and elite status lane not properly enforced. However, boarding was quick and flight fairly empty. Crew managed a full hot meal service including metal cutlery on a 45 minute flight - an impressive feat, though a bit silly and impossible to properly enjoy. Crew were friendly and efficient, though not Saudi and few appeared to speak Arabic which may have been frustrating for many passengers on board. Aircraft a bit dated but clean, flight on time. On board service recommended, but transferring in Saudi is an exercise of patience.

### "really surprised us"
Istanbul to Johannesburg via Jeddah, and Saudi Arabian Airlines really surprised us. Planes were on time both from Istanbul and also from Jeddah . Cabin crew delivered good service all the way with a smile. The planes were clean, IFE only available on the Jeddah to Johannesburg flight. I would fly with them again.

### "food good but not much choice"
Kuala Lumpur to Jeddah with Saudi Arabian Airlines. Last time when I flew with Boeing 777-300ER it was all clean, no rubbish etc. But when I went on the Boeing 777-200LR, the cabin was not in a tidy condition, the old screen looks ridiculous if the latest version of the IFE. The food is good but there was not much choice. Drinks the same thing.

### "no in-flight entertainment"
Saudia Arabian Airlines from Cochin to Paris via Jeddah, return. Cochin to Jeddah there was no in-flight entertainment and the toilets were in a bad condition. The flight from Jeddah to Paris was nice, with inflight entertainment. Returning back was the same issue, Paris to Riyadh the flight was good, but Riyadh to Cochin was a badly maintained flight.

### "crew helpful and friendly"
Geneva to Riyadh to our final destination Jeddah with Saudi Arabian Airlines. The crew was helpful and friendly and we liked the meal. The airplane was narrow and I suggest to change the plan in future to widebody such as new Boeing 777-300ER with entertainment programs. Cabin crew gave a baby gift to my son and all children in the flight. Next flight from Riyadh to Jeddah with Boeing 777-200, we didn't feel comfort in our economy seats. I requested a special meal since reservation and cabin crew provided it. No entertainment during flight.

### "friendly crew"
My flight with Saudi Arabian Airlines from Jeddah to Riyadh was in the morning for business trip. Crew provided cold snack sandwich. I saw friendly crew dealing with passengers. Seat was not bad since I was setting next to the emergency door. No inflight entertainment. Take off and landing were very smooth.

### "cabin crew service very good"
My flight was from Jeddah to Paris on Saudi Arabian Airlines new Boeing 777-300. Our seats were comfortable. The cabin crew service was very good, and they assisted me regarding my child crying until landing. The meal was delicious, and I was happy with the latest entertainment movies.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
The worst airline I have been on. Boarding management was poor, entertainment system on unit was not working and crew member had only one answer that they could change my seat. My special meal was served to someone else. No proper management at Jeddah airport, dirty and smelly toilets, poor boarding system from Jeddah and passengers started pushing and staff did nothing about it. Flight from Jeddah to New Delhi was awful. Seats were so uncomfortable and entertainment unit was missing on my seat this time. Food quality was very bad.

### "excellent service"
First time flying with Saudi Arabian Airlines from Toronto to Abu Dhabi via Jeddah and Riyadh, returning back to Toronto via Jeddah A very good airline, excellent service and entertainment, food very tasty and good seats. There were no delays, excellent departures and landing. Price was very cheap

### "very happy with crew service"
Our route was from Jeddah to Paris (JED-CDG) on Boeing 777-300ER. The plane was new and the business class seat was very comfortable. We were very happy of the cabin crew service during the flight. My baby was crying for 4 hours and they provided non stop help and assistance. The food was amazing, especially the lobster. sSveral channels of entertainment system was opened.

### "an excellent service"
Our route from Geneva to Riyadh was on A320, the plane was full. Cabin crew provided a food menu after soft drinks, menu with meat, chicken and fish. Cabin crew appeared an excellent service for 5 hours. The plane was not bad but I suggest to use new widebody to Europe rather than narrow body. Connected flight from Riyadh to Jeddah was on Boeing 777-200, the seats were very tight. The service was good, since we sat in the first row I  asked a baby chair, but not one provided. A special meal was requested since the reservation time, and cabin crew served it, with thanks.

### "needs to care more"
It is difficult to find a seat reservation with Saudi Arabian Airlines at least one week before especially at holidays and vacations. Ground staff are the worst. Its rare not to find someone clashing with them every time because they know you don't have another option rather than them. At once the ground service clashed with me because he wasn't able to recognize my e-ticket on his computer system. Although the ticket is created by their system. How come this to be my fault. Most of the time I travel with one shoulder bag to avoid the ground services, I prefer to deal with a screen and software rather than dealing with them. The flight crew seems to be more welcoming and hospitable. Their planes look good, I think they are caring very well about services checkup and cleanliness. The pilots trying as much as possible to keep the flight comfortable. Its a good airline, but needs to care more about their customers.

### "the best economy class seat"
Saudi Arabian Airlines fares at least 20% cheaper than other airlines. Seat is the best economy class seat compared against other airlines in my opinion. Large toilets – the average toilet on their Boeing 777-300ERs is larger than that of other carriers. Food as expected with all of the Middle-Eastern carriers, food on Saudi was good. Responsible staff. Flights left and arrived bang on time. Riyadh isn’t what you’d call a world-class airport, with very limited dining, entertainment and rest options. Onboard staff were cold though not rude. Dress code, neither men nor women can travel in shorts and women have to wear something that covers their upper bodies upto the neck. No alcohol – not exactly a loathe for me but I can imagine a lot of international travellers who’d be quite annoyed. You cannot carry any spirits as a part of your checked-in baggage either. I was on calls with their US office quite often towards the end of my trip and mostly dealt with inept staff who required incredible amounts of cajoling to understand what I was trying to say.

### "Really generous checked baggage"
Saudi Arabian Airlines provide a really generous checked baggage (2x23 kg + 7 hand baggage). First leg Delhi to Jeddah was on a Boeing 747 leg Jeddah to Rome on a newer Airbus 320. Lounge with WiFi and breakfast served for the 10 hour transit in Jeddah Airport. The inflight catering and ground service could be better on the Delhi to Jeddah flight, the entertainment was poor, but cannot complain for the momey I spent on a cheap ticket. Passengers don't respect procedures (going to toilet during take off/landing or on taxi way) but that is not crew fault.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Flew LHR to LHE via JED. The flight from LHR to JED was fairly good quality which was an A330-300. Seats were good and quite clean. Stopover was for half a day. I would now choose not to fly to JED only if leaving there. Staff don't try to speak even basic English despite it being an important international airport and no communication facilities (telephone) if there are delays. Flight from JED to LHE was unbelievable. They gave us a very old plane (Boeing 747) and most hostesses don't seem too friendly compared to the other flights. TV's will never work on these flights and quality of plane compared to one going to the west doesn't seem right - the quality should be the same. Better to fly to Riyadh for a stop over as some attempt to speak English. Always try to ensure the stopover is kept short.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
My flight was cancelled on the departure day when everyone was waiting for boarding. We were asked to wait for hours in the airport and the staff were not helpful at all, leaving all the passengers in panic. We were promised to have our flight on the next day at 10am and had us waiting at the airport from 5am in the morning. Bad service and also provide flight that would not work for connecting flight. Waited for almost 2 days to have flight. Asked for refund but never received a reply from them.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Outbound from Heathrow was good. Food was served with a menu card, nice silver cutlery and service was professional despite having many trainees onboard. B777 aircraft - seat was brand new and very comfortable legroom. 3 entrée choices on the menu usually only two for other airlines. Toilet clean, aircraft clean. After the 4.5 hours transit transfering to a different B777 and everything changed. More experienced staff but toilet dirty even before boarding. Crew were rude denying me to use the toilet despite the flight being grounded for 1.5hours delay without any explanation. Food not served with any menu card like previous leg, had to ask staff to show before serving and it was cold. Plane was dirty could see clumps of dirt and dust on the floor. Seat not that comfortable but legroom was still bearable. Overall mixed experience, will take it because of the 46kg luggage allowance something not seen even in business class for most airlines.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Better aircraft now with the B777-300ER unlike before with the old B747s - very significant improvement. Cabin lights were changing from light yellow to purple. I had the seafood meal which was OK. Inflight entertainment has a fairly good selection of movies (still with blurs and cuts though). Price not very far from the competing airline that offers direct route from DMM-MNL  (about 50 to 100 SAR difference) but still provides full airline service. One negative thing is the boarding gate in MNL airport terminal 1. There were not enough seats for the all the passengers. Some were standing up while waiting for boarding. Check-in process was OK. Good value for money. Can compare now with Emirates and Etihad.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Travelled from JNB-JED. IFE was very good. Seat was comfortable. Crew was pleasant and helpful. The real prize winner was the food. Absolutely delicious! The returning flight was bad. JED airport was dirty and smelt. Cabin crew on the aircraft were rude. I asked for a croissant she said rudely: "what? The time food was disgusting.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Recently flew HYD-RUH in Business and have to say it wasn't a pleasant experience. Food was terrible the crew seem disinterested and allowed children to stand up during landing. I had the misfortune to visit one of the toilets and found the entire seat and floor covered in dirt and discarded paper. Advised the attendant and she shrugged her shoulders. Wasn't expecting much and didn't get it. The toilet experience though was the worst I've seen in 30 years of flying and it was in the J class cabin!

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
I recently went on a class trip to Rome with 17 teenagers RUH-FCO-RUH. We were all seated together for both flights and overall had an acceptable experience. I was unpleasantly surprised however by the poor quality of the food and inflight entertainment. The food from Riyadh was nearly inedible and because we were on an older smaller airplane the inflight video entertainment was central with fold up overhead screens. Unfortunately from Rome to Riyadh there was no inflight video entertainment at all. For a daytime flight. Otherwise staff were mostly attentive and there were no other issues. You'd expect a flight leaving Rome to have nice food though no?

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
My children and I had a terrible experience. We were not allowed to check-in our luggage at Queen Alia Airport before plastic-wrapping all the bags even though we did not have to do that when departing from Canada. We were never informed when booking or before boarding the SA flight from Canada that we had to plastic-wrap our bags. Second wheelchair service was not provided although I was instructed to wait in the check-in lobby until a wheelchair became available. No wheelchair came and my name was called out to board the plane and I had to rush through security and get to the gate while limping and pulling carry-on bags pushing a stroller and taking care of my sons. Third our itinerary did not include a stop in Jeddah on the trip from Riyadh to Toronto. Fourth my seat was broken on the flight from Riyadh to Jeddah and I could not sit in the seat properly. When I complained to the flight attendant they did nothing until I escalated the case and was moved to a new seat row as a result. Fifth my son's stroller was checked in at the gate in Queen Alia Airport and was supposed to be available at the gate in Toronto Pearson Airport but it was delayed. When I picked up my luggage at Vancouver International Airport the stroller was not found. The YVR staff kindly helped me file a delayed luggage claim located the stroller and delivered it a few days later.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
My flight was on 19th February SV 755 Business Class aircraft Airbus 330-300 from HYD-JED. This time the plane was in good condition and the seat was quite comfortable and newly designed love the re-imagined seat. Firstly dates and Gahwa was served as a Saudi tradition after the takeoff menu was given in which we could select our preferable meal. The food was good the cabin crew were friendly but the Inflight entertainment was not working as I said to the crew members they said they were trying their best and after 2 hours the flight entertainment started working. Overall enjoyed my flight and looking forward in flying with this airline again.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Flew JED-MNL on February 5 2015. First time after many years. Heard feedback that service is now better but didn't really feel that. Also heard that planes traveling to and from Manila have been replaced with new ones since January 2015. The one I boarded on doesn't fit the description of "new". Departure from Jeddah on time arrival in Manila 10 minutes earlier than scheduled. Only two meals for a 10-hour non-stop flight. Was really hungry by the time the second meal came 8 hours after the first. Both meals are just very ordinary. Entertainment is ok but still far from EK and Cathay Pacific.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
JED-RYD and RYD-KUW economy. The downside is the ground service. Long lines for check in even to just leave your bags if you checked in online. Boarding chaos no priority. Once on board all good nice and new comfortable planes nice FA. Always a full meal even on a 1 hour flight. Bags on belt fast all flights on time.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Flew from Riyadh to London and then London to Riyadh on SV104 two days later. Comments count for both flights. Had a row in front of the emergency exit (45C) and wanted to sleep asap. Got bumped from the back by staff 6 times with their bodies or trolleys and was woken up each time! Eventually gave up on the sleep as I was too frustrated. Staff seemed more obsessed with themselves than interested in the passengers. An old lady was trying to close the overhead compartment while a hostess was watching and didn't help until asked by the passenger. Overall passengers were allowed to leave their seats baggage was allowed to be improperly stored or left in the aisle. Staff did not exude any semblance of control or organisation.

Flew JED-BLR. It was a pleasant flight.It was around 7hr journey with a stop at RUH. The aircraft was a new Airbus 330-300. They gave newspapers and headset but there was no PTV. Cabin crew were not that friendly. Refreshing towels were distributed before push back and before landing. Flight was exactly on time and full. Seat was excellent.

Flew BLR-JED with a stop at Riyadh. It was not fully occupied. The cabin crew were very friendly. Refreshing tissues were distributed before push back and before landing. After take off juice service started. Later there was a lunch service. Between Riyadh and Jeddah they gave sandwiches and juice. It was an 7hr flight.

Travelled earlier this week with family and 2 kids from Mumbai-RUH-LHR. It was a nightmarish experience. Firstly the Mumbai-Riyadh (SV749) flight was delayed 2 hours (with no prior information). Mumbai staff tried to help but limited in their actions. Due to delay we missed our connecting Riyadh-LHR flight (SV117). Was forced to wait for 12 hrs at Riyadh Airport. No lounge access no upgrade and to top an absolutely rude behaviour from airline and airport staff. I will avoid flying in future.

Jeddah - JNB SV447 12/12/15. Flight was overbooked and crew were searching for any place they could fit passengers. I had my child seated next to me as I paid for her seat. 1 of the crew insisted she was an infant and that we reproduce a boarding pass as he wanted to seat someone in her seat. To my dismay the seats leg rests were broken. I had to ask 3 attendants for blankets it took over an hour of waiting before I was given a blanket. I have travelled numerous times with Saudi this was my worst experience!

SV 038 on November 15 SV 560 on November 16 2014. Great service food and all around experience. The check in staff at Dulles Airport were very nice and moved me to a better seat. There were ample blankets and pillows. The food was far superior to other airlines. I really appreciated the lotions and skin fresheners in the bathrooms.

RUH to LHR SV117 16/10. We left 15 minutes late and landed 1 hour late with only a smile as an answer as to why. Food no taste or texture. Entertainment genre all the same. We flew through about 1.5 hours of turbulence the captain put the seat belt sign on but most ignored it and the crew carried on serving drinks - not ideal carrying a hot drink when the aircraft is bouncing around.

KUL to MAD via JED. Flights were all on time. Food was pretty good better I thought on the JED to MAD sector with proper mental cutlery used. Very good entertainment. Seats very narrow with more space between seats on the KUL to JED flight being 777-300 than the JED to MAD sector being a newer A330-300. Attendants were nice mainly from the males. The ladies were rather cold and snappy. However the airline is pretty good and seems to fly to many places with very good airfares. The only let down is Jeddah airport. Much prefer Muscat or even Dubai.

SV447 JED-JNB 26/07/2014 on Boeing 777-200. Check-in was efficient but Jeddah Airport is very chaotic. Flight was overbooked but on time. Flight attendants were friendly and helpful. Special meal and several drinks were served. Meals tasted good. The IFE system was great. However the seats were quite old and not very comfortable.

Flying SIN-RUH-CDG-RUH-SIN. From Singapore Changi T3 on 30th July 2014 B777-300 ER there were only 22 passengers onboard to Riyadh. Beautiful new clean aircraft watched 3-4 movies. 2 meals served to RUH from SIN and I had a 4 hours connection before continuing to CDG Paris on a B777-200ER. Cutlery onboard this flight were Stainless steel while from SIN-RUH they were plastic. Both flights were on time. Allowed 2 pieces of luggage. On the return flight from CDG Paris on 15th August 2014 to SIN via RUH the flight was on time on a B777-200 ER. Had to wait 7 hours at Riyadh Airport to connect to SIN flight on B777-200 ER as well departed on time. Again plastic utensils from RUH-SIN flight. Nothing to complain about.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Terrible service on SV121 RUH-LHR on 19/8/14. Flight left on time. This was a morning/lunchtime flight. The crew served a breakfast which was pathetic in content and size. They then insisted that all the window blinds be closed - surprising since that this flight was not so early in the day that people would need to sleep. Passengers were treated like children - fed and put to sleep. The explanation appeared to be that the crew wanted to and did completely disappeared for several hours. About 90 minutes before landing there was another so-called food service (an awful sandwich). Passengers left this 6.5 hour flight hungry. In complete contrast on the flight to Riyadh they served two proper meals.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Mumbai to Washington. The flight timing was absolutely right - 9.30 pm. Most other international flights depart Mumbai at ungodly hours and we were quite happy not to have to wait some extra hours for that. The check in staff were courteous and the process was smooth though with a little wait for a computer glitch. We had some odd seats but the onboard staff were nice enough to accommodate us in the rear double seat which were empty. The first halt to Jeddha was only 2.30 hrs away. The food service started quite early and we were served a tasty and sumptuous dinner onboard. Inflight entertainment had good variety but the touch screen in front of me was not responding to touch so I had to make do with my wife's screen who promptly went to sleep. This was a tolerable glitch. The Jeddha halt was for 6 hrs. Immediately on reaching Jeddha we were quite surprisingly given meal coupons (approximately worth $20 each). There was however only one restaurant where the coupon was valid and the options were only between veg/non-veg. The food was indeed very good and sufficient in quantity. The airport is small and quite cramped though clean and with sufficient seating arrangement. The seats are good enough for a short wait but no place to take a nap on. The toilets were clean but watery and wet all over. This is primarily due to the reason that local people are in the habit of washing their feet in the washbasins. Next leg of our journey lasting 15 hrs was also excellent and enjoyable. The inflight crew was nice and polite and were in good attendance. We are now awaiting our return flight middle of Sept. '14 and hopefully will have the same experience as on the outbound.

I flew JED-LHR-JED. Aircraft very comfortable and plenty of leg room. Boeing 777. However service was very poor. Flights were less than 25% full and staff paid no attention they allowed phones to be used whilst taxing and during takeoff and exerted no control over passengers. Pilot didn't tell us we were about to land he just switched on seat belt signs. Food was poor my meal was dry and tasteless. I won't fly again unless only option.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Attractive price and on-time every time made me buy DAC-WAS-DAC tickets for the fourth time. I travel twice a year to Washington and in spite of the long transit it is worth it. However during my last trip I was very disappointed to find that I could not use the ALFURSAN lounge with my priority pass even when I offered to pay for the lounge they refused. I spent 16 hours in the airport without a transit visa I could not go to the Terminal 3 where I was told my priority pass could be used also I could not check into a hotel. Overall it is a wonderful airline but some arrangements should be made for passengers on long transits.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Cairo-Manila transit in Dammam on Airbus flight was fine. Seat in Emergency Exit was good and food was good as well. From Dammam it was a Boeing 747-400 it was fine but the seat was not that big service was good and crew provided what you wanted and entertainment was fine. Going back from Manila to Riyadh my flight was delayed 13 hours they provided a hotel to us during this period and the hotel was good. I'll strongly recommend Saudi.

MAN-JED-DXB-JED-MAN. Overall a very pleasant experience. Food was plenty on all sectors. All four sectors were fully booked. Inflight entertainment was good. Both my children were served children's meal as requested. Activity bags were given on all four sectors for kids. All flights on time and comfortable. My only disappointment was Jeddah airport because I had 5 hours transit on my way back to Manchester. Most of the security staff at Jeddah airport did not speak English which made it so difficult to explain. We were given a dinner voucher for our 5 hours transit which was plenty. Jeddah airport is ok for short transit but being a single father and two sleeping kids I had a bit of nightmare at the airport for 5 hours but I can not rate the airline bad because of Jeddah airport. I would not mind flying with SV again. A good experience.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Mumbai-Riyadh-Bahrain. Mumbai to Riyadh was Boeing 777-200. 90% of passengers were Indian blue-collared workers. The FA's were welcoming to everyone alike. Everyone was greeted with a smiling face. Mango/orange juice was served and the lunch service began. Food was hot (had to wait for 5 minutes for it to cool down). Inflight entertainment was fairly good. Unfortunately our row's computers weren't responding. Stopover at Riyadh was 4 hours. The airport had charging points and many cafe's with affordable drinks and eatables - gets boring if you dont have personal entertainment. Riyadh to Bahrain was an Embraer 35 seater. The scheduled duration was 1 hour 10 minutes but the actual time taken was just 50 minutes. 10 minutes after takeoff lunch was served (goes without mentioning it was piping hot) the meal was filling with salad dessert and a main course. The trays were taken back within 20 minutes. In short the entire 10 hours journey was pleasing and worth the cost. I should mention that I got the ticket for 1/5th the original price because of a special offer. Worth every penny and I wouldn't mind paying the whole fare as well.

Flew JED-JNB. Jeddah airport is a nightmare though the Saudia terminal has quite a nice Duty Free shop. Flight announcements are made very unprofessionally and rudely. Taken from the terminal to plane in a bus which took approximately 10 minutes. I really hope that they install airbridges in the new airport. Boeing 777-200 is used on this route. Cabin is quite clean and the prayer facility is a bonus. Meals have got to be even worse than Egyptair. Toilets are well stocked and inflight entertainment is sufficient and up to date. Seat is quite comfortable but the headrest is like a rock. Managed to pull about an hours sleep. 97% of the flight attendants just do their job without a smile while the other 3% are slightly better. All in all I will fly with them again.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
I flew business class from Toronto to Chennai with a stop over for 3 hours in Jeddah. The flight from Toronto (SV 60) was about 80% occupied which was surprising because just prior to take-off the Saudia website showed only 35% occupancy in business class. This means that passengers were upgraded on points or people paid a small surcharge to get upgraded at the airport. I was a bit disappointed with the state of the business class section. The aircraft obviously had seen better days and everything from the carpets to the seats needed to be refurbished. The seats are angled lie flat seats which is not so bad. However the seats themselves were very hard and not as comfortable because the middle section was lumpy with the joint digging into one's back. The pillow and blanket were fine and the amenity kit was also standard nothing to write home about but at the same time wasn't cheap. The food was quite good. Service began with dates and Arabic coffee on take-off and then moved into freshly squeezed juices. They also gave us menus and we could choose between three types of mezze (tapas) - Arabic international and vegetarian - which was followed by a choice of two soups (arabic and international). The main course was also a choice between arabic (fish sayyadi) or lamb in gravy (quite tasty) and chicken or vegetarian choice. This was followed by cakes pastries middle-eastern dessert and ice-cream. Coffee tea and espresso was also offered. Breakfast just before landing in Jeddah was also quite good and wholesome. The service itself was quite well done by a friendly crew who were willing to oblige. They were pleasant and responsive but not overly stylish. The crew itself was international. All in all a decent flight but nothing to write home about. If Saudia improves their cabin interiors and changes their angled lie flat seats by making them softer it will be a much better experience. The flight from Jeddah to Chennai (SV 768) was not very good. The crew were friendly but the food wasn't up to the mark. The service was spotty. No pillows or blankets were given - nor were the business class amenity kits handed out - and many people were allowed in business class either as upgrades or last minute surcharge passengers - not a great practice. The most disappointing aspect of the flight was that the Airbus 330-300 was old and the seats were like the old business class seats. They only had a 45 degree recline which was not very good for a 5.30 hour flight. It is puzzling that Saudia isn't changing its business class seats to angled lie flat as in the Toronto to Jeddah sector.

Delayed for 22 hours Milan to KLIA via Dubai. Re-routed with Emirates in the end no information or help received at all. Return leg no inflight entertainment due to malfunction and rude passengers no chicken meal available. I certainly wasn't going to move either for the clinically obese passenger who would of struggled to fit into 2 seats so he could have an aisle of 3 to himself. Ironically whilst in transit I found Saudi people lovely welcoming and friendly. Our transit in Jeddah was great free meal and excellent duty free stores even a smoking room albeit tiny.

London Heathrow-Jeddah Medina-Jeddah Jeddah-London Heathrow. Flight hostesses nice food excellent. Nice 777-286ER on way to Jeddah from London Heathrow brilliant in-flight entertainment including all the new movies and songs. Medina-Jeddah small Embraer 170 was a bit turbulent but the hostesses did all they could to keep passengers calm. Jeddah-London Heathrow 777-386ER was really nice clean. Gave a variety of foods including chicken and fish. All food was warm and water ice cold. Would definitely recommend.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
From Paris to Manila with a stopover in Riyadh. Flight from Paris to Riyadh was ok but from Riyadh to Manila was a total nightmare. We got our airfare at a promo price so I wasn't expecting anything grand. We had a 9-hour layover in Riyadh from 8pm until 4am the next day for our flight to Manila. There was no internet at the airport no place to comfortably sleep and we had no local currency so nothing to do. The worst part was when we had a mix up with our seats. In our e-ticket we had booked economy seats in the upper deck (economy service but business class seats) in Row 18. But upon receiving our boarding passes we were transferred to the farthest row in the back in Row 63. We tried to fix this mistake by talking to Saudia staff member none were any help. No one said sorry no one attempted to try to help us with our predicament. After 15 minutes of arguing they said that if we wanted to take our original seats then we would have to fly the next day. We had no choice but to take the Row 63 seats so we could finally go home. To make matters worse there was no in-flight entertainment at all in the entire 9 hour flight the small table where we ate was broken the toilets were dirty and had no tissue and the food was really terrible. I will never fly with this airline again.

DXB-JED-DXB. First leg was on the old A330s with no personal IFE. It was a short route so nothing to complain about. Food was normal service staff were alright. Return flight to DXB was much better with the new B777-300 series. The inflight entertainment was good but food was bland. Comfort level was there. I will only fly with Saudi Arabian airlines again if they are using the new aircraft. But overall I'm please with my short route with them.

SV720 DMM-ISB March 18. Travelling with aged father and so I tried to get business seats. Business class does not exist! The seats in Economy class are fine if your height does not exceed 5 feet. If you are 5'11" like me you will be in extreme pain.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
14 hour flight from RUH to IAD non stop on new 777-300. The new planes have outdated configuration in business and very uncomfortable angle seats. The amenity bag used to be 10x better not sure why they are cutting back on what used to be good. The quality of service was horrible everything is a trouble. Screen was very big 15 inches however horrible picture. Not enough selection for a 14hr flight especially if round trip is within a week!

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Saudi's services from London to Riyadh and Jeddah on the 777 have been very good. Meals are generous and choices are excellent the drinks service (soft drinks only) is frequent inflight movies on demand are reliable with a broad selection and crew members work hard to take care of you. Saudi leg room is spacious. I slept well in Business from Riyadh to Heathrow and the Salvatore Ferragamo amenity pack was well equipped. Dates and arabic coffee before take off is hospitable. Ground handling and airport service in Saudi Arabia can be unpredictable and inconsistent but the agent who looked after me at King Khaled International was extremely polite and professional and checked my bags through to Newcastle with minimal fuss. The fare was very good value. Saudi Arabia is not a market in which BA bathes itself in glory - seats sell anyway and the old 767 from Jeddah and 747 into Riyadh have seen better days. Saudi is often significantly cheaper and the equipment is modern.

Flew RUH-MNL on the old 747 aircraft. All business class passenger are now in the main front cabin and changed upper deck to economy. Surprisingly the old route doesn't have inflight entertainment system for this 10 hr flight. Seats are the old leather seats back in the 80's. I believe SV need to upgrade their premium cabin to the same level as other middle eastern airlines on all fleets and not just the new ones.

Traveled from Geneva to Islamabad via Jeddah. The quality of service varied a lot between the two legs. GVA to JED was small plane (A320) the plane was clean and plenty of legroom. Food was good. Service was overall OK. The second leg was on new 777. The staff was rude and impolite. I was given a seat in business class along with few other passengers. Before departures one of the cabin attended ordered all the passengers to leave business section and find a seat in economy. When I objected they let me stay where I was. Staff was not interested in working at all. I will never fly this airline again ever.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Kuala Lumpur to Paris via Jeddah. I have to disagree with comment of other passengers using this airline. I found that this is airline is punctual and gives the standard care of an airline. Jeddah airport maybe one of the worst airports for connecting flights but its not fair to review the whole experience of Saudia based only on airport. This airlines offers a good price to travel with good food and good care throughout the flight. Of course the standard is not up to Emirates or Singapore Airlines but they are doing good job. I would recommend this airline to another customer.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
I am frequent flyer with Saudia. Overall it is good airline if you find a seat. My takes on Saudia are: Always there are no seats available for domestic flights. It is near impossible to find a seat. No direct flights to and from Dammam except to few cities. Unfriendly staff. They stopped serving meals on board and instead they started to give untasty sandwiches.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
I travelled with my 12-month old baby London-Jeddah-Manila. My experience was the worst travel ever! London to Jeddah was acceptable. Jeddah airport is not so worthy to be called an airport to its facilities and unfriendly airport staff - there was no baby changing area nor a feeding area. Flight stewardess from Jeddah to Manila was not so helpful at all! My baby was crying for a long time and none of them bothered to ask if I needed help.I will never travel with Saudi Arabian Airlines again and will never recommend it to anyone.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
I fly Saudi a lot overall they are always on time. Aircraft are new so for the time being in good condition and clean. Most of my trips are short up to 2 hours so don't require entertainment as they hand out ear phones but there are no screens. The Catering has been cut you used to get a full meal service on international flights regardless of length Saudia I would have to say had some good catering on board now its a frozen bread sandwich with tea or coffee better off give nothing as no one eats them. Staff as usual get the basics done don't expect interaction or a smile as that's obviously not in the job description. Fly them again? Probably A to B on time with bags all I need on a short hop and prices are reasonable.

DXB-RUH-CDG. Open ticket price (return): EUR 256. Low fares but really pitiful service: first leg DXB-RUH was late zith no explanation only a tiny and icy cheese sandwich has been served on a 1hr 55min flight. Very unprofessional cabin crew. At least 77W equipment was modern and clean. 4 hours transfer at RUH I accessed the Premier lounge with my Master Gold: dirty toilets no showers no quiet zone. Rude ignorant shamefully arrogant ground staff at RUH. Second leg RUH-CDG: old 772 aircraft dirty and smelly toilets rude and disorganised Arabic cabin crew. Food disgusting with no choice available (despite of information provided). Horrifically cramped seats mine was broken. Actually a low cost airline. Avoid it.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
GIZ-JED-TUU-JED-GIZ and GIZ-RUH-JFK-RUH-GIZ. As you can see I travel a lot on Saudia and know this airline well. The thing I really like about SV is that it's such a punctual airline. Flights are almost never late. Saudi domestic flights are not that expensive and are fully changeable fares with no penalties. If you are traveling domestic travel light and carry it all on. Security at domestic airports in the kingdom is not that strict so you can get a bottle of water and toothpaste through security. Does not charge extra for exit row seating. They also allow a free checked bag on domestic flights. Food service and inflight entertainment on international flights are pretty good actually. But 10 across on Saudi's 777's make it for a very tight flight. I certainly recommend taking SV to the USA during the low season! My flights to JFK were empty. We're talking 75 people on a 777. The amount of personal space on an empty widebody is amazing! I am very disappointed that Saudi has decided to cut costs and downgrade domestic food service. They used to offer hot chicken and rice the local dish on domestic flights. It was always delicious. Now they offer cold snacks only: a muffin cheese sandwich or a tuna or chicken sandwich. I used to get the sandwich but not any more. It is truly a mystery meat sandwich with very little taste. Flying during Ramadan is always a treat. They pass out the snack boxes and tell the passengers when they can begin to eat even if it's 10 minutes before landing they will land with the trays down with the catering items still on them! The cabin crews are friendly all the time. Saudia gets you from A to B without all the fuss of American carriers that's for sure. I recommend Saudi if the price is right you can't go wrong with them.

Flew from Riyadh to IAD. Firstly Delayed 1 hour from departure with no explanation on what caused it.

SIN-RUH-FRA. First leg was in a very nice 777 which was one of the most convenient flights I have experienced. Spacious leg room endless entertainment options and nice food. Transit in Riyadh was interesting as we could leave the airport after a strange procedure that took 2 hours but it was worth it as I don't want to stay in any airport over night if I have another option. Second leg to Frankfurt wasn't that nice. The 6 hour long flight was in a small A320 without much entertainment and with worse comfort. It would be ok for a flight half as long as this but for 6 hours after a rough night was really a bit hard. Staff on both flights were alright nothing special though I would definitely fly with them again great value in my opinion.

I have flown RUH-MNL-RUH many times much cheaper than all it's competitors when flying this route in Business Class. However the service is shocking to say the least more often than not it is late and they don't even announce delays. 7/10 the inflight entertainment does not work and cabin crew whilst generally polite and friendly are not to be found unless during meals. Aircraft is always 747-400 very old and tired. However if price is not an option then I would always seek alternative airlines. My score for this airline is heavily influenced by the fact I am getting Business Class seats for Economy fair otherwise it would rate much worse.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
SIN-RUH on an old 777 with the most leg room in economy I've seen for years. Excellent IFE crew cheerful friendly and helpful taking the time to chat with passengers and laugh and joke. Food was fine with regular drinks. Layover at RUH was met with obnoxious and arrogant guy barking orders for those in transit. Typical overpriced food outlets with seats designed to be uncomfortable. RUH-LHR completely different story. Same old tired plane with IFE not working in many seats seat covers coming off and a tired looking crew sleeping in the galleys and looking like every job was too much hassle and a real resentment for the passengers. One meal service one drink service a crew that could not have cared less if they tried.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
CDG-RUH-DAC. Price for one-way flight: 310 EUR. The SV option is only good if your goal is to save money. Otherwise EK QR or even TK are much much better: chaotic check-in at CDG contradictory information was provided by SV ground staff. First leg was operated by a B777-200 old and tired. Toilets were smelly food was bad and only one drink has been offered for a 6 hours flight! 8 hours stopover at RUH. This could not have been worse: rude ignorant unhelpful ground-staff. No transit hotel option lounge option even if you pay for it. I finally got an access to the Premier Lounge with my Star Alliance gold credit card no shower no quiet zone inside. Second keg from RUH to DAC: shameful. Plane extremely dirty in less than 2 hours no one from cabin crew was paying attention. Some of them were simply sleeping in passengers seats. No amenity kit no breakfast only one drink served and no food at all. Poor security on board old airplanes rude and unprofessional cabin crew: do not use that airline.

Jeddah - Abha - Jeddah. Regular flyer with SV. Jeddah airport chaotic. Will be glad when the new airport is built - eventually. Flight was during Ramadam but cabin crew were happy to offer refreshments to non-Muslims. Don't bother with pre-arranged seating. Cabin crew will move passengers so that families can sit together. Cabin crew looked resigned to their jobs. People on their phones during the flight seats not upright as instructed. Overall poor safety within the cabin. An elderly lady was sitting in the exit row with bags on the floor and the cabin crew walked past. Honestly they get you from A to B without the seriousness of western airlines.

Flew domestic return from Riyadh to Najran. 2nd time with SV first to Doha. What sticks out the most is the unprofessional cabin crew. Cabin crew never checked seat belts or seats prior to take-off or landing they themselves sat chatting with pax. A pax next to me was actually re-seated during take-off. Cabin crew forgot to serve meals to an entire row. No options to SV on most domestic routes but I will always try to fly another airline internationally. Nevertheless good legroom and new airplanes. Average food no IFE.

Very pleased with my recent experience. I travelled Hyderabad-Riyadh-Cairo-Jeddah-Hyderabad sector. The in-flight service was excellent and food (I chose AVML) was very nice. I liked the seating and the flights were on time. The only problem I had was the non functional IFE system on Cairo-Jeddah and Jeddah-Hyderabad sectors. All in all a very good experience for the money I paid for the ticket.

Turkey-Jeddah-Manila. First leg was chaotic. No system at all. Passengers were not informed by staff when to enter the aircraft. Flight delayed an hour. Arrived at Jeddah late. Cabin was so dirty especially the toilet! No entertainment at all during flights. Staff informed us the next flight would be the following day. We were brought to the passengers lounge. Stayed at the airport for 27 hours with no couch to sleep on. Really very poor service. That would be our first and last experience with this airline.

Dubai-Jeddah-Riyadh-Dammam-Dubai. All flights were on Airbus A320 except the Riyadh-Dammam leg was on a small Embraer. Check in at all airports was chaotic specially domestic flights SV has an odd policy of one bag per passenger only to check in I had 2 small carry ons only both together didn't exceed 17 kg however I was allowed to check in only one bag which led to a lot of luggage in the cabin which was chaotic. Aircraft's are a mix of old torn planes and ok however I don't like the leather seats concept looks very old and full of strains. No entertainment at all on all sectors some flights with no refreshment however I was surprised on Dammam-Dubai sector they had a full service which was roughly a 75 minutes flight but full dinner and tea and coffee was served. Cabin crew are ok not very friendly but they were doing their jobs with no enthusiasm but doing it right except for the Asian crew as they are always cheerful not very fond of SV but I have to take it every time I am in KSA due to domestic flights though nothing major to complain about but will never fly it in international long flights.

Recently flew from Rome to Johannesburg via Jeddah. I was very pleasantly surprised. Flight was comfortable we were given blankets toothbrushes etc the food was good there were mini TVs in the back of each seat and the selection of films and programmes was great. Staff were all friendly and helpful a great experience I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them if they maintain this level of service.

Flew DOH-JED-DOH in Business Class. Service was very good IFE was adequate and easy to operate food was also average. Seats on the A320 were very comfortable and price was excellent when compared with the competition - the luggage allowance was very generous. I will use them on this route as the overall package is very attractive!

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Nairobi - Jeddah - Kuala Lumpur and back. Seats fairly comfortable and food satisfactory although all choices were not offered and not available. Inflight entertainment was also okay. The staff looked tired and unfriendly snapping at the passengers although they did address them as Sir or Madam. Had a long stopover in Jeddah - transit facilities very poor air conditioning set at cold temperature and food provided basic and monotonous. Ground staff handling transit passengers were not very helpful and forthcoming with information and reacted angrily to passengers asking for information. We had to be re-routed on the return leg from Jeddah to Nairobi via Cairo with Cairo-Nairobi sector with Kenya Airways.

New York-Jaddah-Islamabad. At JFK check-in was smooth. Flight left on time on a Boeing 777-200. Flight was full nice clean aircraft. Food was average. They have an open self-service snack bar at the rear of the aircraft. In Jeddah we had a 10 hours layover. Had to haggle with staff at the airport for dinner vouchers. Jeddah - Islamabad was a Boeing 747-400 and every seat was full. Food was ok. Only reason I will fly this airline again is its low price.

Jeddah-Jizan-Jeddah. Full flight on A320. Don't bother trying to reserve seats when booking everything will change on the plane. On the return leg I was moved 4 times to accommodate other passengers. Wasn't happy at all. I only fly with them when I have to as there is little resemblance of order and structure on the aircraft. Crew did a good job with refreshments but they spent more time trying to sell airline products. Did I feel safe - yes marginally. The aircraft was new but the seat pitch was pretty tight. They were on time so I guess that goes in their favor.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Saudia changed our flight 3 times not different departure times but different dates! We had to fly one day earlier than booked and before we left got another return date. They told us that the booked flights had been cancelled. We made the reconfirmation one week before our flight back to Germany staff told us that this flight was cancelled as well. We had to take a flight back 2 days later than originally booked. Onboard food was good and the rest so so.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Dubai to Jeddah with a connecting flight to Tabuk to Riyadh and Damman and finally back to Dubai. The whole trip was just a disaster with canceled tickets even with confirmed tickets in my hand. No explanation. Terrible service at the check in desk with not even an excuse - don't even know what customer service is.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Jeddah to London in Guest Class (Oct 25). Clean and roomy 777 with seatback screens showing recent Western and Arabic movies and TV shows on demand amenity packs for children a good lunch shortly after take off (including specially ordered children's meals which were great) and sandwiches with a chocolate bar an hour before landing. Check-in calm and well organized in the dedicated Saudia terminal at King Abdulaziz Airport boarding was orderly and our luggage was on the belt swiftly at LHR. Arabic coffee served before departure by a friendly and professional crew. Passengers in all cabins receive an amenity pack. Last time we flew Saudi we returned via Paris CDG. In common with Frankfurt Rome Milan Madrid and Geneva the continental European cities use a much smaller Airbus A320/1 which adds to the length of the flight and the entertainment systems are also a bit more basic. Nonetheless staff and service are just as pleasant and irrespective of the route or the aircraft standard leg room - at 34" in Economy - is amongst the most generous we have encountered.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Jeddah - Damman. A321. Business class. Was the only one is business class apart from a crew member. Despite warnings about switching off electronic devices he insisted on using it the entire flight. Food was great hot breakfast with fruit salad and pastries. Honestly even with just one passenger the cabin crew seemed disinterested. Bussed requiring a headset and gave up after 10 minutes. You could seem them sitting in the galley. The best part about the flight was the food.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
RUH-JED. Check in at Riyadh was fast and easy no waiting at security. Information on the ground is not very good. Change of boarding gate not announced so a bit chaos for boarding. Flight on time A319. Economy seating comfortable good space between rows. Small snacks and drinks during flight crew very polite and attentive. Bags on belt short 10 min after arrival at the lounge.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
CDG-JED-TUU. After a good trip from RUH-LHR we then caught Eurostar to Paris. Upon checking in at CDG were told that the seats we had booked for travel between JED and TUU had been cancelled without reason. Staff at CDG were then able to re-book 3 seats for my wife and children but on arrival at JED it turned out they had been cancelled as well once again with no apparent reason. After 3 fruitless hours of to-ing and fro- ing between every desk possible with no-one was able to tell us why seats had been cancelled. We had to come back at 04.00 to see if we could get standby seats meaning we had to stay at a hotel. Thankfully we got seats for the early morning flight. Not a very good experience. I must say there was some helpful staff but mostly not much seemed to get done.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
LHR-RUH-KUL. I was pleasantly surprised. Quick easy check-in at Heathrow polite service excellent meals with generous portions and on demand inflight entertainment up to any airline's standards. Planes were in good order and the 3 hour transit in Riyadh was hassle free. The only negatives were that the flight attendants did not respond to the call button and on the RUH-KUL sector the toilets were in an unusable state by the end of the flight. Overall a good experience and would fly with them again if they continue to have low fares.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Many internal sectors flown on Saudia over the past 6 months. I tend to prefer the A320 and A321 aircraft rather than the widebodies although the best aircraft is the E70 in terms of seat comfort and space. I've never been delayed and baggage has always arrived quickly. Food is served on most flights but is often bland and unappetising. Flew the 777 from JED to DMM 2 days ago and it was very uncomfortable. Was grateful we landed early so as not to spend any longer in the seat. From my experience Saudia are ok for short sectors (not that there is much choice in Saudi) but I wouldn't consider them long haul.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
London to Jeddah was ok apart from there being no available inflight entertainment meal choice was non existent and you got what was left. Flight from Jeddah to Manila - seat had no recline at all and yet again no working inflight entertainment. Return flight Manila to Riyadh with no inflight entertainment worked only for half the cabin unfortunately not my side. Saudi then changed the connecting flight time from Riyadh to London. When this was noticed at check-in in Manila the Saudi staff claimed my itinerary and ticket was wrong! Very poor customer service.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
LHR-JED in Business with a punctual departure and good level of comfort onboard a 777. Hot towels arabic coffee and dates before pulling back from the gate excellent juices and hot drinks and a more up-to-date entertainment selection than expected. The meal service was nicely done and the lunch enjoyable. Early landing easy boarding and disembarking. Pleasant and professional crew. Very good value for the fare paid.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Rome-Manila via Riyadh and Jeddah on return flight. Tickets are cheap but the trip is challenging. Starting from the long queue at check-in in Rome. First leg was ok except for entertainment which is far below standard. Vegetarian food was quite good toilets ok with a variety of cologne hand cream etc. Good travel kit. Stopover in Riyadh - airport is a nightmare with no shops. Riyadh-Manila - toilets barely had soap and towels. Return Manila-Jeddah-Rome was a nightmare. Manila-Jeddah delayed 5 hrs. They provided food but nothing for vegetarians so I had to buy food. Arrived in Jeddah where staff were unfriendly.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
LHR-Riyadh-Jakarta return. First leg was good with all systems working well and on time. Riyadh-Jakarta was poor on a 747-300 series. I didn't know anyone still had these and it hadn't been refitted. Single large projector screen no individual screens. Return journey was worse same 747 with no IFE and no individual lights. I was in the middle most shutters were down so I couldn't even read. Second flight on B777 just started watching inflight movie when the screen goes blank. I asked twice for it to be fixed but got no joy. I tried the call button however this did not work. Cheap but not good value.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Frequent flyer using 777-268ER's from LHR-RUH/ED. Seating comfort has improved by far with plenty of leg room throughout the plane. They have improved the seating on all of their planes and now fit A330's with internet onboard. The cabin crew staff service can become slightly poor including ground service but for what you pay for it is definitely worth it. The food provided needs improving more but is better than most Arabic carriers. Inflight entertainment is not the best but has increased by far.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Rome-Manila via Riyadh and Jeddah on return flight. European legs were ok - cabin crew services and attitude of staff. Legs to Asia were in all these fields poorer and staff spent most of the time chatting together. All this is just minor problem comparing with transit. Especially Jeddah airport is one of the worst I have seen in 15+ years of frequent travelling. It is probably one of most passenger unfriendly airports there is simply no space to wait in transit lounge. People are sleeping on cold ground toilets are extremely dirty.

Riyadh-Jeddah. Domestic flight on B777-200. Business class. Seat 1L. Very comfortable service. Check in business counter very fast. Lounge in Riyadh is basic. Onboard service very good for a 1.5hr flight. Seat comfortable angle lie-flat. Dedicated bus for boarding on both airports. Fast bag drop on arrival.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
The first leg of the journey London to Manila via Riyadh was on time and reasonably comfortable on a par with most major airlines. However from Riyadh to Manila the journey involved an old 747-400 with no working IFE. The standard of catering was much lower than the first leg of the journey. The return journey was no better and coupled with the five hour wait at Riyadh airport a very dismal place made for a very unpleasant journey. Avoid this airline if you can.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
LHR-SIN one-way with 2 hr transit in Riyadh. A surprisingly pleasant experience. Selected emergency exit seats - row 38 at time of booking which were comfortable though opposite the toilets and allowed some sleep. Meals were tasty and of generous proportions and two were served on each leg so quite filling. Transit in Riyadh was without hassle. Criticisms - drinks were served in one burst and then nothing for hours unless you walk to the galley. Cabin crew ok but not overly enthusiastic.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
Dammam-Riyadh-Istanbul. After waiting 2 hrs on the ground the pilot announced there was a technical fault and we had to return to the airport. No one assisted or directed us. The flight from Riyadh to Istanbul was missed because I was still in Dammam. I was calm and after 2-3 hrs of waiting there was only 1 flight available the next day. I went to baggage claim and found my bag in the corner of the airport. The hotel provided was very poor. I didn't request anything and they didn't compensate anything they didn't even ask.

Doha-Jeddah then onto Madina return. We used their new A320 which was furnished with their new short range product and we where surprised of how good and comfortable their plane was and helpful and attentive their staff were. A very nice choice of meal service though they did not offer a menu but the portions where large compared with other airlines and I plan on using them again.

JED-FRA. I was very pleased with my experience on this airline. Check in was quite fast. Staff are very accommodating and efficient. Aircraft was full load. The entertainment was amazingly great. Good choice of Video. The meal was surprisingly amazing. Most importantly flight attendants were fabulous. It was a mixed nationality. I lost count of how many times the flight attendants came around with water and juices. The one seating beside me needs to charge his laptop and when he asked the flight attendants without hesitation she immediately resolved the problem. Good customer service" Toilets were very clean and usable. Great value for money.

DMM-JDH-JDH-DMM. Check in was lousy; check-in gate opened only 30mins before flight was due to depart. Smooth take off and landing. The seats had a 32" pitch and were surprisingly comfortable. Clean interior including the seats and the head rest. Food was average however was nearly put off from eating when the stewardess shouted at my husband after asking her to repeat what was on the menu. Overall not bad for a 3 star airline. Experience could be greatly improved by putting the emphasis on delivering "good" customer service.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
I had my first experience with Saudi Arabian Airline. It was not good at all. Putting the extra seat in B-777 made it very congested from London Heathrow to Jeddah. Passenger facilities at Jeddah airport were almost nil. Ground staff were very rude. The connecting flight had trouble and was cancelled. All passengers were pushed into an old Boeing 747 like sheep without any seating order. The food was cold and FA's didn't seem to care. This was probably the worst journey I ever had. Would not recommend it to anyone except if you want to save some money booking tickets in advance. But still it is not worth it.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
My first experience with Saudi Arabian Airlines and most likely my last. From the initial boarding a male flight attendant was rude and condescending to passengers. Once seated in assigned seat the aircraft was not full allowing myself and another passenger to share the four centre row seats. However before take off a flight attendant repositioned the passengers in front of us into our row stating the row was reserved. Although not pleased I thought that they had good reason perhaps a passenger who needed to lay down due to age or medical condition. However once inflight it became painfully obvious why the row had been vacated. The cabin crew actually arrived with blankets and pillows and throughout the entire flight from Dulles to Riyadh took turns sleeping. It was shocking that paying customers were placed in this position so the attendants could sleep! The food was good and adequate throughout the flight. The in flight entertainment initially appeared to be on par with other airlines however the movies ended 1.5 hr into the flight not to resume and no explanation as to why. I was very disappointed with the level of professionalism extended by the cabin crew in particular the male attendants. I will go out of my way to fly with another airline in the future even at an increased expense if it means avoiding this kind of experience again.

RUH-LHR. Check-in ok except agent told me he had no lounge invitations left and I needed one to get into the lounge even though my ticket was J Class. I went to the lounge and negotiated my way in. The lounge in T2 at RUH is the best lounge at RUH though not the same standard as average lounges you would expect in most international airports. Flight on new B777 on which the IFE did not work. Cabin crew not very helpful though tried to be friendly. At meal service I was informed that I had ordered a special meal when I didn't. I was informed that I did not have a choice! I asked for a menu as non had been offered prior to the meal service nor had any fruit juices and after four attempts I was brought an UK arrival card! Eventually was given a copy of the menu after the service. Tried to use the massage function in my seat but it switched the same function on in my neighbours seat! Watched my ipod and read my book for the rest of the flight. I have flown this airline many times both in Y and J and the service is very it and miss with this episode being the norm.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
JED–RUH operated by B777-200 in high density seating configuration with only 2 rows of First Class and the rest Economy in a 3x4x3 layout with a LCC style seat pitch. Most B777s in Economy have a 3x3x3 seating layout and the extra seat therefore results in narrower seats and aisles. This is perhaps acceptable for short haul domestic flights such as this was but this would be almost unacceptable for medium / long haul flights. Somewhat incredibly a hot meal was served in Economy on this 1h 10m flight – a choice of Mixed Grill or Pasta with pitta bread a cake and a Mars Bar. Water came within the Meal Box whilst soft drinks were offered separately along with tea and coffee afterwards. The flight crew were the usual Asian multi- nationals who were efficient professional and cheerful. The flight left on time and arrived early – and all for US$ 75.

LHR-RUH afternoon flight. Used Saudi Airlines due to increased legroom and sensible flight times. Pleasantly surprised by the experience - seats narrow but flight wasn't full so managed to share 3 seats between 2 of us. Food was fine - while I normally like a G&T on a flight I can survive without one! AVOD etc was okay. Immigration at Riyadh was very quick despite warnings from colleagues - obviously not many other international flights coming in at that time. After haggling the taxi to central Riyadh was SAR80.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
MXP-JED-DAC DAC-RUH-MXP. Departing flight 2 hours late from MXP and then wait more than 6 hours in JED for connection flight without any information. Nobody knows when the fly or what to do. If you ask someone nobody answered. Very bad staff behavior and information desk don’t know anything. It was hell on returning flight. The flight was late at DAC airport. At RUH waited more than 12 hours for the connection flight. Staff say that departure will be in 1 or two hours but not any exact hour so that they don’t need to allow hotel room for the passenger. I missed my next flight from MXP to ARN and train from ARN to home. Avoid the flight if you don’t want to waste time and money.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
RUH-DXB. Airline's website would not accept credit card info; reservation made through the airline's toll-free number (the prices on the website were incorrect anyway). There was a quick security screen before check-in at RUH. As I was about to place my luggage on the belt a worker told me that he would do it. After it went through the scanner he rolled it about 30 feet to the check-in line. All of this took about a minute. I tipped him a dollar US which was the only small bill I could find quickly. He informed me that this was inadequate so I dug into my carry-on and found a bit more. This was very irritating. Other passengers also were annoyed by this and an elderly Saudi passenger who joined me in line used his cane to send his "helper" away when he requested additional tip. Check-in was quick and went smoothly. Boarding was not announced; it just happened. There was "open boarding" in coach (meaning seat assignments were ignored). Seat pitch was very good. Food surprisingly good. Flight attendants were efficient on this short flight and sufficiently friendly. The flight left and arrived on time.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
LHR-JED-LHR. Check in at Heathrow very slow arrived 4 hours before as requested checked in 1 hour before - had to run to the aircraft! Problem was staff were dealing with LHR-RUH-LHR flight and both flights were overbooked. Staff at Jeddah terminal have big attitude problem. Staff on the plane do not assist with seating so if someone has taken your seat you have to co-ordinate everything and get the passenger to move yourself.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
I have travelled from London and back six times between London and Dammam sometimes via Jeddah and sometimes via Riyadh because our company policy is that we must. Jeddah is a lousy experience. It took so long to clear passport control that I got bumped from my connecting flight and had to buy a ticket from another airline. The transfer desk is a clamouring horde and you have to fight your way to the front. No information is given out at Dammam Airport either in Arabic or English as to departure gate numbers. Flights are labelled "free seat" at the last minute even when you've got your seat number and Saudis like to play musical chairs so that you aren't sitting next to their womenfolk or so they can sit in family groups. The ticket sales staff are rude and indifferent and lack the language skills necessary for the job. The ground staff likewise. They invariably start shouting at you if you express any disagreement with them. On my last flight back to Saudi from London my booking was cancelled and I had to go through my company's travel section to get it reinstated.

Frankfurt to Riyadh A320-200. The allocated lounge (sky lounge of Korean Air) is large but of minimal facilities and at the furthest point away from the SV gate in T2 concourse E). Boarding was efficient despite no line for J class passengers. Better in flight service than the outbound flight but nothing really personal. Lunch selection was not available and fruit juices were not fresh (although advertised as such). IFE operational but with little selection way below other carriers. All products I was interested in to buy on sky sales were not available (found out that the aircraft was not restocked for 48 hours prior to the outbound flight). This lack of consistency and attention to detail make SV an unfavorable airline particularly if you are planning to travel as a premier customer.

Riyadh to Frankfurt A320-200. Check in : terrible Y class passengers pushing themselves to the J class line as if there were a line - the location is filthy with dirty carpet and luggage tags everywhere. No web check in available for international flights. Boarding disorganized no priority boarding for J class passengers. Cabin with good temperature although utilization of a single aisle aircraft was disappointing for this 6 hour flight. Seat Leather good pitch and width but the leg support failed to extend properly. Staff service automated masked faced service non welcoming un-professional when attempting to answer question on lack of IFE. Breakfast was Y class quality in plastic container. Snack acceptable. Drinks basic. IFE operating but not loaded with anything (not even the safety video) the Flight attendant didn't do it manually. Very disappointing experience not of business class standard. SV continues to be so inconsistent.

RUH-LHR return Business. Outbound the business and first class check in is mobbed by economy passengers asked several staff to be checked in as I was in business class and told to wait - after 45 minutes I demanded to be checked in as flight was closing to be told by the same Saudi staff I didn't you realise your were business class. Flight out fine Asian staff friendly and obliging the Senior walked around the cabin with a scolding look on his face. Return much older aircraft seats dirty and did not recline food dreadful cabin looked filthy staff cold rude and didn't care less that 3 kids running around the cabin actually slapping other passengers as their parents did not care what they did. The final straw IFE not working. Airline gets worse every time I fly with them no more.

JED-CAI on all economy A300 - one of my worst travel experiences ever. Departure was set for 3:45 am however plane was delayed on the ground for 1.5 hours and we ended up departing at 5:15 am. Delay apparently due to the fact that they left some luggage in the terminal. During the wait aircraft was hot and sticky and air conditioning was giving out hot air despite the 38C outside temperature. Cabin crew couldnt' be bothered to reassure passengers shrugging shoulders and showing no signs of care at all to complains. Water and refreshing tissues were eventually distributed but the ordeal was unbearable. Seats were small uncomfortable and ripped at parts. There was no inflight entertainment not even in-flight magazines.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
My wife was booked Riyadh to Bangalore travelling alone and booked in business class. We arrived at the airport at 0100 hrs and completed check in. She was given a boarding pass which did not mention the number of the Gate from which to board. When I asked the man at the counter which gate we should go to he waved his hand dismissively and told me to go to immigration. When my wife went to immigration she was told the flight was cancelled and referred back to the airline. We came back and asked a Saudi Airlines employee; he told us the flight would leave at 1300 hrs. I asked him why this information was not communicated to us earlier as we had provided our mobile numbers at the time of booking. I also asked why this was not told to us when the boarding pass was issued. There was no satisfactory response to my questions. We reached our home at 3 am and returned to the airport at 11 am. There was no indication at the airport of when the flight would leave or indeed which from which gate passengers should depart. The staff of Saudi Airlines were of no help at all. The plane finally left at 2 pm. On board my wife found that her seat would not recline and she had sit upright for 5 hours. Though Saudi Airlines advertises vegetarian Indian food for flights to India there was no vegetarian meal available. Not only is the service deplorable but staff are brusque and unhelpful. We choose this carrier because it is the only one that has a direct flight from Riyadh to Bangalore. Perhaps we should start flying other carriers even if it means a transhipment because their staff may be more competent and helpful.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
RUH–JED. RUH domestic terminal checked in using the self-service kiosks. Security done in less than a minute and then airside in this somewhat tired looking terminal. Saudi Arabian has a small Business Class Lounge which was crowded but offered a selection of hot food sandwiches etc. The boarding process was a bit chaotic but that has been a feature of this part of the world for many years and you just have to go with the flow. B777-200 had the new leather Business Class seats angled lie-flat and there is an AVOD IFE system with a large screen. This was not operative during this short domestic sector. Business Class cabin crew comprised one male and three females – a mix of Asian and Arab personnel who were attentive and cheerful. Arabic coffee and dates and inflight a full hot meal was served comprising hot rolls salad choice of pasta or roast chicken and dessert. All in all a very pleasant experience.

### Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review
This airline does not measure up to other 3 star airlines in terms of service. I just flew 3 legs (2 economy and 1 business). The staff attitude is basically indifference to passengers. Two of my legs were delayed 1 hour plus yet they did not announce the delay until after the departure time. For one there was nobody at the gate to answer any questions (DMM to DXB). Business class service on board decent food was average. Things like making sure people's cell phones are turned off that people stay in their seats at takeoff and landing are virtually ignored by the cabin crew from what I could tell.

RUH-LHR Business class. Check in very slow - we were told to stand to one side although it was our turn to check in as a party of VIPS arrived with 40 cases. Lounge fine with good array of food and drinks. Internet stations and staff friendly. Full business class cabin with lie flat seats. AVOD good with plentiful selection of recent movies and programmes/games. Crew were efficient but very robotic - no smiles. Food average although plenty if it.

RUH-DOH Business. Check in fine at RUH no queues straight through security to the lounge. Juices drinks etc and some light food leather couches and quite relaxed. 2x1 seating in this Emb 190 with large old style biz class seats very comfy for one hour flight. Three course meal served - only two of us in Business. Crew friendly bags off promptly in DOH. Had tried to change flight and ran every number possible until I finaly got through the following day after the flight had left - was told next flight full in C but could do Y and told to ask at airport to go stand by for C. Lounge is shared by most carriers in Doha and was good with hot and cold foods espresso etc. Got to gate no C class seat was given. Economy service basic but consistent and food not bad for Economy. Overall inconsistent - some good some bad. The ticketing people in their sales office are probably the most uninterested people i have ever met in any customer services dept.

RUH-JED Y class. The aircraft was refurbished B777. Seat pitch has been reduced in economy with 3-4-3 configuration but new leather seats are not that bad. Touch screens with AVOD. Hot snack served and gets full credit (as opposed to the cold one BAH-RUH with GF). Cabin crew were fine. Ground crew need to go back to training and learn basic customer service etiquette.

RUH-KUL-RUH appalling service I don't know how they get away with it. Flight delayed three hours leaving RUH absolutely no explanation or attempt to apologize. When we get on board they decide that it is free seating we sit anywhere (although we would have been more than happy with our original seating) then get told to move when I complain a supervisor comes on shouts at my family and I and than threatens to have us offloaded by the police. All in all it takes an extra hour to move everyone around and find enough seats (although even then some passengers appear to be seated in the galley the whole journey). Flight attendants have no concern whatsoever for safety never checking seat belts or providing extensions for children. Plane (747-400) in a mess with bits falling off inside the cabin. Return journey we have 1 business class seat and 4 economy - better (ie. on time at least and good service in business) but very rude attendants in economy demand my wife to prove we have booked the seats before serving a meal - only start backtracking when we realize that we also have a business class ticket. Although I am based in Riyadh I will try very hard never to fly Saudia again on international flights.

Heathrow - Jeddah - Riyadh - Heathrow. Check-in at LHR for lunchtime departure was instant - no queue. Boeing 777 2x5x2 seating. Comfortable seats decent legroom economy about half- full. Newspapers offered (mainly Arabic) followed by soft drinks. Typical airline food. Seatback screen but not AVOD - system had to be re-set twice by cabin crew early on but otherwise no problems. Flight smooth with the exception of a couple of Arab children running repeatedly up the aisles - fairly normal on MidEast airlines where parents rarely discipline their offspring. Major stroke of luck on arrival at Jeddah as I was attending a conference for which Saudia was handling many of the arrangements so whisked through VIP lounge passport stamped and into a taxi within 20 minutes of getting off aircraft. Jeddah-Riyadh again a 777 an 80-minute hop. Aircraft packed which made the serving of a full breakfast particularly impressive : full marks to the cabin crew. Not a lot of smiles from them but understandable when concentrating on serving 300 people in such a short time. Riyadh-LHR another 777 but this time 10-abreast (3-4-3) and seats noticeably thinner and less comfortable. Felt as though there was around an inch less legroom too which made an appreciable difference. Cabin crew helpful: one FA volunteered that my seatback screen was not working and offered to re-seat me. Only problem was again children running around and one little girl was actually standing on her seat as take-off started. Toilets acceptable. In all a series of flights I would rate as better than average and around 30% cheaper than British Airways.

My family went to Khartoum from Jeddah. The trip is only one and a half hours long but it was a disaster. Check-in staff at the airport had no concept of client service. Check in itself took about one hour because the system was down. Once my wife and kids (one child and one infant) boarded the plane they found that it was an old leased 747. They were seated all the way in the back - tables and footrests were broken. The level of service was extremely poor. Unfortunately the Jeddah - Khartoum route is completely neglected by Saudia in terms of quality standards (even though they are profitable routes) and i can't wait for the free-skies policy to take effect so that the competition either forces Saudia to raise its standards or to disappear. For me I have experienced similar problems on the Jeddah - Paris route and that's why I think that a three star rating is exaggerated - two stars maximum.

DXB to RUH. 20 minutes out of RUH we are served a lunch box - Iftahar meal for breaking the fast. On landing all lunch boxes are still with passengers tray tables are down seat belts are not checked prior to landing. Safety is not a priority. RUH to DXB late afternoon flight. Still Ramadan. Just prior to take off cabin crew serve us dates and a glass of water - for breaking the fast. Cabin supervisor decided it was time. 40 minutes after wheels up they announce the breaking of the fast. Obviously no concern for safety standards as pax placed their tray tables down to put their water and dates on during take off. Where are the CAA safety inspectors when you need them.

LHR-RUH C class I was upgraded and delighted to get it. About 14 passengers in Business class and 6 were children under the ages of 6 - who were let do what they wanted causing major annoyance to other pax. Parents didn't care less and crew did nothing to stop them. Food was good being Saudi no booze but plenty of other options etc Avod available though choice not great! New seats lie flat seats in First as are business - I see that in economy that was ere known for the 34" pitch is not any more - with 10 seats across instead of standard 9 across and 31" pitch. Some staff work hard male crew looked fed up and did little but chat amongst themselves. Overall Saudi are cheaper they give a a strong 3 star product and service.
