### "crew were welcoming"
I had booked this fare at a very discounted rate as I needed to travel back to BLR. The check in experience was good, I had arrived early and there was still time for check in to open so I was told to wait for 30 mins before check in in my luggage. Post that I had noticed that the inbound was delayed due to which the departure was also slightly delayed by 40 mins. The crew were welcoming and this flight was not completely full. During boarding I had noticed that a lot of people had come with trolleys and they were told to check in their luggage which is good as a lot of folks come carrying big trolleys that just block the cabin overhead bins. The flight tried to make time en route and landing in BLR was swift along with luggage retrieval. One point to note here is that the seat pitch may be on the tighter side compared to other airlines but otherwise this was a good trip where the crew also distributed water bottles to everyone during boarding.

### "furious and disappointed"
I travel at least four times a month and Air Asia truly ruins any flight that I have to unwillingly take with them. With the horrible past experiences I made it a point to never book this airline but some times due to emergencies I had to resort to this and as I expected I was so furious and disappointed by the end of it. The staff isn’t trained at all and I don’t think they’re equipped for basic customer management. They are angry, rude and unbothered. Worse is, I think they’re so frustrated with where they are working

### "amazing service and support"
Taking this opportunity to appreciate and thank the entire team of I5 792 for providing amazing service and support during the entire journey and making it a memorable one. I have traveled a lot however this was the first time for my parents and trust me it could not have been better than this if it wasn’t the crew who made it happen, specially Mr Shubham the cabin supervisor. He is extremely polite, professional and empathetic. He treated my family like his own and was very polite and respectful to all the other customers as far I noticed. I wish to see cabin crew like him on all flights because they are the ones who make a difference. Would also like to highlight his amazing announcements, loud and clear unlike many other. Once again thank you everyone for an amazing experience hope to see you all in future on AirAsia flights.

### "Waste of time and money"
The worst airlines in the history of mankind. Absolutely hate it, won't recommend at all. Stay away from it and go for Indigo or Akasa. Waste of time and money.

### "thumbs up to boarding crew"
Would like to give big thumbs up to boarding crew Ms Noor at Tiruchirappalli Airport. We are four family, flying from Trichy(India) to Singapore). Boarding process went very smooth with her providing detailed explanation before keep luggage, what can bring and what cannot, She is quite knowledgeable and inform the passenger upfront to complete the boarding process smooth and fast.

### "Services were good"
Not Verified |  My mother travelled alone in Air Asia on 07 June 2023. The flight was very comfortable. Services were good. Ground staff was extremely helpful. Sincere thanks to the ticketing staff.

### "thank entire staff of Air Asia"
I will like to thank entire staff of Air Asia. We were on family vacation with my 2.6 year old child and got amazing cooperation. Without any hassle we could book seats and the entire journey was enjoyable. Will like to be thankful to the pilots as the landing on all the flights was smooth. I paid my gratitude to the staff personally too.

### "impressed with her fluency"
Special appreciation to the cabin crew Sonika. I was super impressed with her fluency in announcements, all three different languages and it was just amazing to hear her out.

### "completely unacceptable behaviour"
I was supposed to be travelling from Bangalore to kochi on the AirAsia flight on March 23. We reached the Airport on time but because they didn't mention that the flight is in the newly launched terminal. We were late to reach the boarding gate but even though there was still time to board the flight, the crew didn't allow to board the flight. We knew this because when we where waiting to leave from the second terminal 15 minutes after not allowed entry another Airasia crew asked tried to help us to board the same flight 15 minutes after being denied entry. This is completely unacceptable behaviour unexpected from AirAsia India and we will make sure not to choose this flight again in future.

### "hospitality and customer delight"
Airline staff helped me with last minute web check in cancellation also helped locating the luggage and provided the best support and service. 5/5 for such hospitality and customer delight

### "customer service was excellent"
First time flying with Airasia. Hospitality and customer service was excellent. I arrived late in airport due to my car got an accident and check in gate was closed. However upon requesting airline staff that I have international connection, they allowed and assisted me in getting to the aircraft. A very big thank you to AirAsia India for making my travel successful.

### "exceptionally great service"
I must mention about this this exceptionally great service rendered by AirAsia. I travelled in the Air Asia I5 472 from Goa to Mumbai on 18 December at 1 am. On arriving at Mumbai, my mother realised that she forgot to carry one of her bag from Goa airport to the flight. I can't explain in words how Air Asia has gone out of their way to get my bag from the Lost and Found Department, and send it to Mumbai by the earliest flight all free. The bag reached us in Mumbai safe and sound. I recommend Air Asia services as their way of handling their customers before flying, during the flight, and after flight is too good.

### "Overall not a bad experience"
Airline with most compact seat arrangements. Iwould avoid this but in last moment its fare was cheapest from Delhi to Jaipur. Icing on the cake was I got last row window seat as it was the only row which was Available, fortunately no one was there in the middle seat so little bit of comfort. Departed on time and reached Jaipur before time. Cabin crew looks courteous but as it was early morning 5 am flight so after boarding slept all time so never needed to interact with them. Seats are compact as i said earlier. Overall not a bad experience for less than hour ling flight.

### "most congested seating"
Service was ok, on time boarding and departure and so was arrival. Cabin crew were courteous but with respect to any other airline in India it has the least legroom, most congested seating configuration I found in India. This is one reason which makes me rethink before booking next flight with them.

### "most congested seating configuration I found in India"
Another LCC in India, subsidiary of AirAsia. Service was ok, on time boarding and departure and so was arrival. Cabin crew were courteous but with respect to any other airline in India it has the least legroom, most congested seating configuration I found in India. This is one reason which makes me rethink before booking next flight with them.

### "the staff was not cooperative"
Not Verified |  AirAsia India is just pathetic. We were traveling in a group of 6 including an infant and on check-in the executive didn’t even bother to ask us or allocate the seats together as courtesy. All of us got separate seats and it was a nightmare to travel with a baby and no support from my family cause of these seats. Even some exemptions in the baggage allowance was close to nothing. Overall we felt the staff was not cooperative and the rules were way too stringent.

### "Worst customer service"
Worst customer service at Ranchi airport and this is the 3rd time, each time they create a unique bad experience with AirAsia at Ranchi. I saw them charging extra fee luggage, where couples were carrying with 14 kg cabined for checking. When I intervened they came with some random rules. But for sure will ensure I never use their service again

### "had worst experience ever"
I booked my Air Asia tickets for 2 Nov around 2 PM flight which got cancelled and rescheduled to different flight at 4.25 PM same day. At morning I received a call that new rescehuled flight delayed by 1 hour. After reaching to airport I again received a message that flight is delayed for 1 hour more and then it got delayed for more finally taking off at 9 PM and landing at 11.15 PM. So my 2.30 hour flight was actually 9 hours long. In airport AirAsia provided lunch which was only 5 spoons of biryani and there was no food provided in flight. Due to this I had to pay for lunch and for dinner and finally taking cab instead of metro. All of this increased my budget. So disappointed with Air Asia, No value of our time, had to pay more and my whole day and plans was compromised. Please avoid taking AirAsia, I with my family had worst experience ever.

### "none of them had received calls"
I have booked tickets for 6 people. 4 hours before the flight take off I received a call from AirAsia customer service that the flight is cancelled due to technical issue. I was asked to take the next day 5 am call. I told them I had already started my commute to airport and try to find an alternate flight for the same day. 10 minutes later I got a call again stating that the technical problem got resolved and I can use the same flight. When I enquired with some of the co-passengers to find out whether they received similar call from AirAsia, none of them had received calls like that.

### "Thanks to his generous behaviour"
Yesterday we travelled from Guwahati to Chennai, unfortunately at the last moment of check in there was a problem for which we were not allowed to check in. Thanks to one of the employee of AirAsia Mr Soni who helped us to check in n get the boarding pass. Thanks to his generous behaviour and helpful nature.

### "staff was good"
The seats were comfortable, leather covers on the seats provided premium look and comfort. Leg room was low as per my height (5 10), staff was good and services were also good. Ground staff was helpful. Due to some reason i wasn't able to check in and book my seat, i requested on the counter he allotted me the seat although he requested for a positive feedback to be written.

### "It was a great experience"
The service of the head Airhostess Ms Kadoyee was very impressive, she was very Humble, understanding to all our grievances and explained in details about the various facilities and services in the flight. It was a great experience flying with AirAsia. Luggage arrangements and boarding was excellent. Personal care with senior citizen was a great sign of humanity and consideration. Thank you

### "Terrible experience with check in"
Terrible experience with check in at Goa airport. I had paid for the much advertised Red Carpet service. There were only 2 counters open and both, (including one which was supposed to be red carpet) were crowded and disorderly. There was no premium feel and I had to go to the ordinary counter for baggage drop. Felt cheated for paying for a service that the airline could not offer and it appeared to be a way of fleecing customers. Check in staff were not sympathetic and did not care. Pathetic service. Will never travel by AirAsia India if there is a choice. To be fair to the airline, the only good experience was the hot and good food served on the flight.

### "Awesome polite cabin crew"
Great fares. Excellent ground staff who calls you to let you know gate is closing. Awesome polite cabin crew. Comfortable seats. Excellent service. Good food.

### "such a lovely staff"
The ground staff Ms Piyalis at Kolkata behaviour was excellent. She helped us in completing all the process very fast, she was cooperative and very humble. Thanks to AirAsia for having such a lovely staff.

### "Boarding was delayed by 30 min"
From making a reservation first they canceled the morning flight, they shifted the passenger to afternoon flight. Boarding was delayed by 30 min. A small seat if someone is broad and and heavy weight.

### "Overall a good flight"
On this flight as my travel agency had performed a group booking check in online was possible just couple of days before the flight. However when tried to print the baggage tags at the airport kiosks, I was unable to do so. The check in desks helped to drop the bag and I was pleased to note that during the boarding process, the staff was ensuring that people board as per their zones and this also helped prevent overcrowding during boarding. As the flight was a bit on the lighter side, the crew made me sit at an emergency exit row seat free of cost which was really great as the legroom was really good for a 2 hour 20 minute journey. The flight landed also on time and baggage retrieval was also swift. Overall a good flight. Appreciated the gesture of the crew allotting me an exit row seat.

### "my experience was not pleasant"
Vizag to Delhi and my experience was not pleasant. I booked international baggage and additional Baggage along with VIP for all 3 passengers. Other PNR only VIP. When I booked I had questions about baggage allowance showing 45kgs per passengers so called customer service (Twice) for clarification and suggestion for carrying 60kg per passenger. With the answers provided I was convinced and proceeded with the same. When i reached the airport at the check in counter the staff informed me that my luggage is overweight and i need to pay, initially i was trying to explain what's my understanding from customer service rep of airasia, immediately i was cut off by the line manager standing there in suit saying "how can you believe customer service guys and you must know". When I responded that i have call records he said ok lets play them now and listen to check in. When i was trying to play the record he again cut me off saying what exactly is my problem as i should be aware of baggage allowance policy and started laughing with his colleague. This was very insulting in front of my family as they felt very embarrassed to be treated like novice flyers. I responded saying I will deal with this later, let me get checked in and paid the extra money and while leaving the line manager along with other staff were murmuring and laughing. Soon one of the staff approached me, looking that we were upset, saying "sir we will do what we can do to raise a service note of what happened here" and apologised and left.

### "thankful to them"
Not Verified |  Due to some unexpected scenarios, I came to airport few mins before the flight time and boarding time was supposed to be much before that. I was about to miss my flight but the AirAsia team cooperated a lot and helped me board the flight which was very kind of them. I would be thankful to them. I hope this kind of service continues for all the different airline carriers also.

### "allow normal size sports equipment"
I’m glad Air Asia allowed my tennis racquets in the checking luggage without extra charges both ways Bangalore - Bhubaneswar. AirAsia’s policy to allow normal size sports equipment without extra charges is highly appreciated.

### "Will never choose it again"
Not Verified |  Absolutely worse service. No customer care agent available to speak. My flight got cancelled because of some technical reasons by AirAsia India and i will get the refund amount after deducting 1000 rs from the total amount i paid. Regret to choose AirAsia India. Will never choose it again nor will refer it to anyone.

### "we will not travel with you any more"
I have taken flight with my family from Srinagar to Pune I5 737. Flight details was there will be 35 minutes halt at Delhi airport and Pune passenger will not be allowed to off board. When flight landed at Delhi air hostess announced that Pune passengers need to contact ground staff. We were total 8 Pune passengers which include kid of 2.5 yrs and senior citizens also. Ground staff told us that we have to off board and take another flight of AirAsia which will take off at 22.50 and handed us another ticket. The Srinagar flight landed at 22.20 then they take us from bus to exit and asked us to go from internal transfer with again all handbag checking. At ticket scanning the new tickets which they handed from that 2 tickets were not scanning and throwing some error in their system. So we have to wait there for 10 minute to get the clearance. After that ground staff was asking us to run till gate number 49 to get into another flight. With us as mention having senior citizens and also a kid, literally we had to run with all our hand bags. At gate 49 AirAsia person was saying to us that previous flight do not have that much of capacity. This is the worst management I have seen till now they are not aware about their flight capacity and asking passengers to take another flight in mid of journey. Thank you Air Asia for this pathetic experience and we will not travel with you any more.

### "very serious concern about baggage"
I strongly recommend not to use AirAsia India. I have to raise a very serious concern about baggage. On 21st May we two families landed Srinagar at 1:30 pm, out of our 6 bags 1 bag was missing on the belt, upon asking they said bag was left behind for scanning it will come in next flight, after several follow up they delivered the bag to , me at hotel but the bag lock was tampered, bag got damaged for which I have sent email to nodal officer but the reply I got from them was asking age of the bag, invoice of the bag, that means they can do this by compensating by age of the bag which I have used only 3rd time.

### "for the first time and now I really regret my decision"
I booked a flight from Delhi to Bangalore on 1/6/2022. I booked this ticket on 24/05/2022. Since I stay far away from the airport I choose the 9.30am flight. But on 27/05/2022 I got a message from AirAsia stating that they have cancelled my flight and they have re-accommodated me to another flight which is from Delhi to Visakhapatnam and Visakhapatnam to Bangalore but the problem was with the flight timing which is at 6.00am. If I need to get this flight I have to be at the airport by 4.00 am, which is impossible for me based on my location. I booked a premium ticket so I tried to change the date but I have to admit that I choose the wrong date in panic. Then I tried to cancel the ticket but the AirAsia agent told me that they can't refund the amount. It is their mistake for cancelling the flight and they won't refund for it. I usually prefer Indigo, I have never faced such problems but for a change I went with AirAsia for the first time and now I really regret my decision. I will never ever choose AirAsia again in my life time. This is opinion.

### "Very disappointed with AirAsia India"
I had worst experience with Air Asia airlines today with flight from Delhi to Jaipur. At check-in unnecessary harassment to my 14year old, first with ID, not convinced with Aadhar card. I had to rush to give money he asked to pay as compensation, as my child's boarding had started. I had no option but to give money. Allowed luggage is 25kg, which I clarified twice before doing online check in, this guy says only 15kg. Now again pay money for extra luggage. Very disappointed with AirAsia India.

### !"I am done with AirAsia India"
I want to highlight 2 pathetic experiences of AirAsia India here; One is the latest one wherein my younger sister was forced to miss her flight when no assistance was provided to her and she was held back by the staff till 2.30 when she had reached the airport at 2.05 PM. No one had helped her by escorting her through the security check. My sister is 18 years old and was travelling to Srinagar, AirForce Station to my sister, I purposely booked AirAsia, because I being a Tata employee prefer Tata products and services and also my sister being travelling for the first time alone, I took the leap of faith in AirAsia. However, rather than getting assistance she was stopped and held back by the staff of AirAsia itself which led to waste her time and missing her flight. When tried to negotiate with the staff they offered her to pay them 8000/- INR for the upcoming flight. I tried to speak to one of the executives over the phone and she rudely responded saying that drop an email, I can't help. I am done with AirAsia India and would definitely make sure for everyone around me.

### "The crew were friendly and welcoming"
I had booked this flight a long time back in February so the fares were much cheaper. The web check-in process was smooth and it is observed that if one selects the default seats, they are free of cost however if one selects any other seat then a small fee needs to be paid. The bag drop was in terminal 1 of Mumbai airport which was done in a jiffy. Boarding started well ahead of time and the leather seats were good however for a taller person they might be slightly cramped. I was pleasantly surprised to know that I was entitled to a corporate meal as that was booked during the time of booking and so a small veg roll with some mango juice was provided on the flight which was quite good. The crew were friendly and welcoming during boarding / de-boarding. All in all a satisfactory flight.

### "This has been a terrible experience"
I booked an air ticket from the Air Asia website and paid with my MasterCard. A transaction fee was also deducted. When the flight was rescheduled, I opted for a refund. It was confirmed in the WhatsApp chat. The refund was processed on 12 Nov 2021. But the money was not received on my Card. I contacted them repeatedly regarding this issue, but every time I was informed that the money was paid from your end. I repeatedly had long queries at my bank. The bank checked everything and said no money was issued to my MasterCard. I have been contacting them for more than 2 months at least 10 times. No effort was made by them to refund. Only empty words. This has been a terrible experience for me.

### "a very nice and unexpected touch"
We had booked tickets to Bangalore back in January where the fares were pretty reasonable. It was observed that during the online check in, once can do the process 12-14 days before the flight and also the default seat selection was free of charge which is well appreciated as other LCCs usually need the passenger to purchase the seat. The baggage drop was smooth process and the boarding also started on time and was greeted upon boarding by a crew member. The seats were comfortable enough however on longer flights this could be an issue where the seats might be cramped for someone on the taller side. The flight itself was uneventful however before landing, the crew distributed small perfume bottles which was a very nice and unexpected touch because in this era where airlines try to look for every opportunity to charge passengers, this gesture of providing free Titan perfumes was much appreciated. I would consider flying Air Asia India next time for the right price.

### "service offered were horrible"
Worst experience from AirAsia India as the service offered were horrible and non professional. They cancelled the direct flight a day before our journey and reschedule a long connection flight for travel without our consent which made us sit in the airport waiting area for 10 hours without any customer service from the airline.

### "the worst airline you can board"
Possibly the worst airline you can board. The staff is terrible and seems unpaid as rude behaviour reflects upfront. They will cool down the cabin temperature to below 18 degrees and then start renting out thin blankets for 400-500 rs. They change the gate frequently and wont send you any message. When you confront them, they will simply shrug their shoulders. No words to define how low they can go to harass customers. Experience it on your own to know more. Do not opt for this airline. It may save you couple hundred bucks but will give you nightmares of life time.

### "charge you for every ounce of luggage"
Terrible airline. Please don't waste your money by choosing to fly with them. They will charge you for every ounce of luggage including laptops. Do not recommend them ever

### "the refund amount is low"
Not Verified |  I recently booked flight tickets for me and my family to fly from Hyderabad to Bangalore. But due to the bad weather condition in Bangalore and due to the heavy rains I decided to off my journey and when I decided to cancel all of my tickets the airline showed me a refund amount of not even 10% of the amount I paid. I can say that it is the worst airline ever. I not even showed up and I am cancelling it far more than 24 hours but still the refund amount is low where I felt very bad.

### "never recommend AirAsia India"
It was a early morning flight and I was unable to do web checkin. I approach to the AirAsia desk and staff was totally unprofessional. She just ignored and start attending the other customers. After waiting for a while she just walked out from the window. I will never recommend AirAsia India. Horrible ground staff.

### "seat pitch is something that needs to be kept in mind"
After a long time, I had decided to fly back to Bangalore on Air Asia on this afternoon flight as the timing was convenient for the arrival. A point to note is that the check in for the flight has opened almost 2 weeks before the departure of the flight as opposed to the usual 48 hours which is present on the other flights. Also another point to note is that the default seat selection which is provided by Air Asia seems to be free of cost, however if we try to change our seating rows, then a charge of Rs 250 needs to be provided for the window / aisle seats. As me and my wife were travelling together, I had decided to go with the default seat selection so as to avoid the extra seat fares. During the check-in the staff was proactive enough to accommodate me and my wife in a separate line which was faster than the usual long queues present. Also the crew wanted us to provide a feedback on the check-in process and how it could be improved and this was a pretty fun thing that was done. Boarding started well on time and one thing to note is that, if you are a person on the taller side, the seats could be a bit cramped. I have flown on other low cost carriers and Air Asia seems by far the most cramped when it comes to seat pitch. On short haul flights they are fine however on flights of more than 2 hours it could get uncomfortable. Also during boarding, I did not see the crew welcoming everyone on board which is something that was surprising considering how well the staff at the check in counters were. Flight landed well ahead of schedule and baggage was also retrieved quickly. For the money that was paid, the service provided was nice. However seat pitch is something that needs to be kept in mind.

### "wait in Pune airport for 7 hrs"
We booked our flights for 21st sep 2021 from BBI>DEL,& on 28th sep 2021 from DEL>BBI (direct flights ,no stop-over) in advance on 13th August 2021 so that we did not suffer by anything. Today we received a notification that our direct flight is going to be connecting now from BBI>PNQ>DEL (with almost 7 hour of halt in PNQ). Now my elderly parents have to wait in Pune airport for 7 hrs which making me furious. You are not able to give me earlier or later (+- 2,day flexibility) flight because you do not have any direct flight so its none of my problem. I purchase for some service and I deserve the same.

### "overall flight went well"
Not Verified |  The AirAsia airline was pretty good. My height is 183cm even then I felt comfortable with the leg space. The airhostess were very polite and helpful they changed the seats too, those are willing to change there seat can change and he arranged the passengers who are sitting in middle seats to window or side corner seats and it was in budget. Tthe ground staff were also good but not so good in politeness But overall flight went well.

### "insisted on redistributing the luggage"
There were 3 passengers (including a kid of 2 years) and 3 cabin bags. Total weight of 3 bags was less than 21 kgs. It was just that one bag was 8kg and others very light. So it should not have been an issue. But airline staff insisted on redistributing the luggage among bags. I see no point in doing that.

### "received my refund after 6 weeks"
Not Verified |  Made an online booking since the fares were cheaper than others. To be fair to them the flight crew were helpful and attentive on the outward journey. The return flight was cancellede. We were promised a refund. After a month of waiting, started communicating via e mails. Absolutely no response. Calls and mails received but no refund. After much follow up and constantly asking received my refund after 6 weeks.

### "Wonderful and attentive crew members"
Extremely wonderful. Definitely worth flying with again. Wonderful and attentive crew members. Cheerful and always with a ready to help attitude. Keep up the good work.

### "share the pleasant experience I had"
Not Verified |  I would like to share the pleasant experience I had, flying the Air Asia from Bangalore to Jaipur via Hyderabad on 19th Feb'21. It was my 15th Yr wedding anniversary and I wanted to make it special for my wife. So, I checked with the cabin crew if they could do something special for the occasion and they immediately obliged and made a special announcement wishing myself and my wife and the entire cabin crew came and wished us and sang for us which was amazing. They surprised my wife with the gift I had bought for her and made me propose in the flight which was romantic and nice. The cabin crew members Bindu and team where really amazing and they did a fantastic job. Like to thank them and the captain for making our day special and something to remember forever.

### "Kudos to the entire team!"
Kudos to the entire team! I had a morning flight from Bagdogra to Kolkata. It was a short flight but I must say I had one of the best experience so far. Smooth and Comfortable! A special mention of in-flight attendants Anjita and Deepika they definitely deserve praise especially in time of COVID. The safety was well taken care of. They were extremely hospitable and at the same time professional. Keep up the good work!

### "I cancelled the ticket"
They are not responsible and do not care about their customers. They haven't approved a cancellation of my ticket since 2 months now. Also there is absolutely no one taking the responsibility. The flight timings were changed and I cancelled the ticket due to that. I have no idea what is it gonna take for them to respond to their customer.

### "applied for cancellation"
Pune to Jaipur. I paid for a flight I didn't even get on due to lockdown. I applied for cancellation right away but so far got nothing in return for that flight. And since the day I applied for cancellation I kept contacting the flight but they kept wasting my time for a month and still I got nothing.

### "staff didn’t let board"
Mumbai to Delhi. Reaching 30 minute before departure time, the staff didn’t let board. I got stuck in roadside traffic on the western expressway. I requested a lot with the available staff but he didn’t listen my request and denied. I complained on AirAsia India feedback but they just close my case without any investigation or taken any steps.

### "refund in the form of credit points "
Not Verified |  AirAsia India is not customer-oriented air carrier. In Covid-19 spread issue, they are allowing to cancel tickets but refund will be in the form of credit points which can be used later. And allowing to reschedule the itinerary with payment of ticket difference amount.

### "no telephone service outside India"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Amritsar via Kuala Lumpur. This is one of the worst airlines out there in terms of getting into contact with. They have no telephone service in countries outside India so it is impossible to get into contact with them when you need help. Their AVA service on their website is completely useless. For the low price, which is technically not because with all the add ons such as seat prices and bag prices  all add up to be normal prices of flights with other airlines.

### "cabin bag bigger than permitted size"
Delhi to Bangalore via Hyderabad. We had extra luggage of 6 kgs and we were ready to pay for it, but the lady responsible for our check in was determined to make us pay extra (first she told for 1kg extra luggage we will have to pay 580, which should be 400, we were 2 people and the total check in baggage was exact 30 kg - one 18 and other one 12 - she said if we pay her 1100 extra, then only she will be able to allow both luggage, then she said that the cabin bag is bigger than permitted size and we will have to pay extra. It was a very bad experience for me since I had to move a lot of things right over there in order to balance the weights.

### "cancellation charges will apply"
Not Verified |  I booked my flight from Chennai to Delhi in February, travel date March 21st. 4 tickets including 2 kids. Because of coronavirus I asked to cancel my ticket. But they told me cancellation charges will apply. This critical situation also they not waive the cancel charges. Return flight I booked with IndiGo, they waive the cancel charges and refund full amount.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Not Verified |  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality Of AirAsia India. In fact the cabin crew was really 5star in service, especial thanks to Manthan the cabin crew purser on our flight from Pune to Jaipur on 9th March.

### "even changed the seat"
Mumbai to Srinagar via Delhi. Selected the flight due to least trouble of not changing the plane at Delhi and paid extra fare for seat selection. It was good till we landed at Delhi. There I was handed a new boarding pass and was made to run from one plane to another boarding gate undergoing the security once again. The airline had changed the flight and even changed the seat as per their choice without a word of sorry.

### "the flight was quite nice"
Bengaluru to Mumbai on Air Asia India was taken this early morning and the check in process was smooth enough at Bangalore where after getting the boarding passes printed out at the kiosks. As my check in baggage weight exceeded the 15kg free allowance as I had extra luggage packed, I was made to pay around 375 Rs for every extra kg and the staff there were generous enough to waive off 1 kg extra in exchange for a South Indian breakfast on the flight which was reasonable enough. The boarding started on time and there was some nice funky boarding music being played and the seats were comfortable enough although on longer duration trips, it could be uncomfortable. The flight departed on time and even though the flight was full, the crew were very nice and after takeoff I even got the South Indian breakfast which consisted of an idli, medu vada with sambhaar and upma. The meal was decent enough although if one has to purchase this directly in-flight, it was quite pricey at around 350 INR and maybe the quantity does not justify the price. But then again, low cost carriers aren't exactly known for being generous when it comes to inflight food and beverages. Landing was on time and retrieval of the baggage was also swift. I would say that the flight was quite nice and even though low cost carriers try to maximize revenue through ancillary services (meals / excess baggage) they provide the best functional experience when it comes to taking you from point A to point B. And Air Asia does that pretty well. I cannot think of any area which was lacking on this flight. Keep it up.

### "Need to learn a lot"
Delhi to Chennai. Not on time departure. Senior crew member doesnt know how to respect the passenger. Went on to an argument with the crew for money exchange. I was not handled properly. Didnt get a message either for the delay I had to rush and come later found the flight was delayed. Staffs in Airport were awesome. Corporate meal info was not mentioned on the ticket. Need to learn a lot from Indigo.

### "Made me pay more for luggage"
Chandigarh to Delhi. Worst experience ever. Made me pay more for luggage than I did for the flight. Also flight was late and nobody from the staff was at the gate to answer any questions. Not traveling from this ever again.

### "delayed for 2 hours initially"
Delhi to Ranchi . Worst service, it got delayed for 2 hours initially then for 1 hour and after that they stopped informing about how much more delay will be. It was super frustrating for everyone, we pay money for comfort and service and it is worst in all cases and also asking for another ticket or refund they did not answer to that and made it even worse for us.

### "charge for rescheduling"
Bengaluru to Mumbai. I  booked AirAsia India flight for 18th Dec 2019. I wanted to reschedule it. When I called airline to ask for cancellation first they told they can not reschedule it. They are taking 2000 rs penalty charge for rescheduling. This is an unreasonable demand.

### "rescheduled the flight"
Was supposed to fly from Bangalore to Kochi on 12th November 2019. As per the timing on the ticket which I booked in May was 9.35 AM. I reached the airport early at 6 AM. I proceeded to check in counter, and was shocked to find out that the the flight took of at around 5.20 AM. But in the ticket the time clearly shows 9.35 AM. If you had rescheduled the flight it's your (AirAsia) responsibility to inform the passenger or issue a ticket with the right Timing. Before booking I checked the timings with 2 travel agencies and on make my trip and all mentioned a flight at 9.35AM I never got a message not a phone call about any change in time.

### "want the refund of prebooked meal"
Pune to Bangalore. I had ordered a meal (non-veg) by prebooking it. However I was not served the meal which I had ordered. I want the refund of the prebooked meal. I am disappointed with the service that the airline provided.

### "Rs 4000 for 2kgs extra hand luggage"
Mumbai to Bengaluru. The staff at check in told me about the extra hand luggage, but did not inform me about the exact cost that could be charged during boarding. For check in, they charged me even for 1kg extra. Zero tolerance. At the time of boarding they demanded Rs 4000 for 2kgs extra hand luggage. They said that they would not let me take the flight without paying 4k. Untrained and manner ess staff.

### "Extremely poor services"
Ranchi to New Delhi. Extremely poor services. Flight delayed with no information. No staff ready to talk at the airport and behaving as a layman. Extremely poor. Feared of missing my next flight from Delhi as it would put me in a heavy economic and social loss.

### "Very frustrating experience"
Jaipur to Kuala Lumpur. Very frustrating experience. Really felt humiliated by the behavior of staff. First he told me to arrange luggage according to the pnr. We had 2 bookings. And there was total check in baggage allowance of 120 kg. But 2 of our members were not present so total 80kg baggage allowance was allowed. Thats okay I can understand this. Then next the guy told us to make 20kg according to the pnrs. He was not ready to consider both bookings simultaneously. . One of our group member doesn't have last name so booking was like First name and staff there was not ready to allow us to board. One of their staff was talking in a very rude way. Then we moved to airline's next boarding pass check station. The guy there also stopped us and kept us waiting for 5 mins for the same issue (first name and last name). He told us to wait so that he can confirm at the check-in desk.

### "crew were very proactive and good"
AirAsia India from Bengaluru to Delhi. The original time of departure was 00.05 hours however there was a delay of 15 minutes which was communicated in advance. The boarding pass print and check in of the baggage was performed at the designated points. Boarding was slightly delayed and as a result of which we ended up being delayed by over 20 minutes. The seats inside the Airbus were comfortable enough although it could be uncomfortable for longer flights. Seat pitch was comfortable at 30 inches and for someone who is 5'10 it was okay. The crew were very proactive and good. I observed that the crew even provided infant seat belts and snack items. We landed at Delhi around 20-25 minutes behind schedule and the baggage collecting took some time on the coveyor belt. Overall I'd say that if you get this flight for a good price and for a reasonable distance it is okay.

### "smooth take-off and landing"
Mumbai to Bengaluru. This is the first time I flew AirAsia but I had a wonderful experience. I normally feel sick during take-off and landing but I loved the smooth take-off and landing. Would love to fly only in AirAsia henceforth. Thank you

### "wonderful customer support"
Extremely wonderful customer support service as compared to other competitors in the market. My query was resolved within 5 minutes, that was through live chat rather than waiting for hours holding the call. Very happy with the service.

### "didn't offer refund"
Mumbai to Kochi. The flight got rerouted, the was no transperancy by the airline. They shuttled us around for over 6 hours and were not cooperative, they lost our luggage. Reboarded us in Bangalore and didn't offer refund. They were not open to providing food or accomodation. Where we could not go and settle into a hotel. Had to spend the night in the airport without our luggage.

### "very bad experience"
I came from Bangalore to Mumbai yesterday it was delayed half an hour. Today I am going back to Bangalore, which I have booked at 6:30 but it’s delayed to 10:50pm - again it’s delayed departure time is 11:40pm. This is first time am using AirAsia India but very bad experience. These people are not professional.

### "chaos at the airport"
Hyderabad to Mumbai. Absolutely horrifying experience with the staff, after a delay due to heavy rains in Mumbai. The staff had no information, no updates given to passengers. Later our boarding passes were revoked since they wanted us to fly by another airline after 7 hours of delay, and only to find out that the other airline is already full and boarding gates have been closed. There was chaos at the airport, clueless till then end about their actual journey to Mumbai.

### "not informing the customers"
Hyderabad to Delhi. This is my second trip on AirAsia India and I came to know only after reaching the airport. No call, SMS etc. During my last travel also, there was no prior intimation and the flight kept getting delayed after I reached the airport. I had to take an off from office the next day due to AirAsia. I understand that airlines have operational issues causing delays but not informing the customers is unacceptable.

### "a pretty unpleasant flight"
❎ Not Verified | Kochi to Mumbai. The seating was very uncomfortable with less legroom. The flight crew as well was unfriendly and unpleasant. The upright position of the seat itself was difficult to deal with. Overall a pretty unpleasant and unfriendly flight experience. Not recommended at all.

### "couldn’t find my baggage"
Delhi to Hyderabad on 16 June 2019. The flight landed one hour late in the night and I couldn’t find my baggage in the belt. When I checked with AirAsia customer support they told me that the bag doesnt come with the flight and I need to wait for the next flight for my baggage. Since its already late at night, I asked whether they could deliver it to my home. They said they cant do that because this facility not available for domestic flights. Then I had to sit near to their counter and continuously enquire about the status. I called the customer service to find alternate option and they suggested me to fill some feedback form from their website (I didnt understand how that will help to get my baggage). They are not even accepting that its their mistake.

### "virtual assistant is of no use"
The company doesn't have any live customer care people to talk to which in times us really needed to get important information easily. Their so called virtual assistant AVA is of no use. I tried checking my flight rescheduled time number of times and all the time the result was "there are no flights". Thirdly, the flight which was supposed to be departed around 8pm it got rescheduled 3 times which in turn made the flight to be departed at 1 am next day. The boarding in the plane started at 12:45 am which delayed the flight further. Lastly, there were no announcements being made regarding this matter.

### "One of the best experiences "
Not Verified |  Kolkata to Bangalore. Amazing quality. One of the best experiences I have had while flying. Just that there were not a lot of choices for food items. A few flight merchandise were expensive. Otherwise its an amazing experience to fly by AirAsia.

### "pay more for a couple of extra kgs"
Pune to Delhi. I was asked to pay more for a couple of extra kgs luggage and on top of that the rep asked if i would like to buy a better seat. When i confirmed the seat she still chose to not to hear it and give me a seat in Row 26.

### "delayed for 4 hours"
Hyderabad to Delhi. Flight was delayed for 4 hours. First we were asked to report at one gate and then they changed the gate no 3 times. No one was bothered to inform us properly for the cause of delay. I will never fly with AirAsia India again.

### "Clean aircraft and helpful crew"
Bengaluru to Delhi. Low cost carrier that provides low leg space, below average food menu, average service and zero tolerance to excess baggage. Avoid if you can pay a little more for better comfort. Clean aircraft and helpful crew.

### "Gate changed 5 times"
Hyderabad to Delhi. We were to fly from Hyderabad to Delhi, schedule departure was 2025 hrs, departed at 0005 hrs. Horrible Customer experience: Gate changed 5 times in 3 hours. Caused so much inconvenience for kids and the elderly. Some passengers were initially allowed to board a bus to the flight. They were deboarded and the aircraft was rerouted to Kolkata. Delhi passengers had to face the brunt. Finally, they brought an aircraft which was in HYD and same was used 4 hours later

### AirAsia India customer review
Guwahati to Delhi. We get it its a budget airline. But if the flight is getting delayed then you should let the passengers know about the delay beforehand and not 1 hour before the flight.

### "were all so warm and helpful"
Guwahati to Bangalore. I was travelling with my 2 year old son who was down with fever. The crew was very kind and empathetic and took personal care of us. On board one staff in particular made the journey very comfortable. Ground Staff was very helpful in Bangalore airport. Thank you very much to all the staff. Despite the flight delay, they were all so warm and helpful. I look forward to flying with AirAsia again.

### "ground staff were well trained"
Flew from Indore to Goa on Air Asia. Check in was easy - we opted for the paid front row seats and got them easily. Flight on time and ground staff were well trained. Crew on board however were very casual. The inflight supervisor spent the entire time while boarding was going checking her phone and chatting with other staff. Flight otherwise quite okay.

### "amazing, good and polite"
Bangalore to Kochi. One of my most favorite flight is now AirAsia. All the flight and ground staff are so amazing, good and polite. The most important thing for a passenger is the quick response for their queries. Its easy to connect with the representative and clarify everything which we require. Most attactive is the staff performance and dedication towards their job.

### "got rescheduled again"
Ranchi to Bangalore. This was my first and last time traveling with AirAsia India. It was okay when the flight was rescheduled, but got frustrated after taking boarding pass, flight got rescheduled again 1 hour. I can understand there will be rescheduling but this is a very bad experience. Had a bad time for over 3 hours in this flight.

### "service was very good"
Goa to Hyderabad. The service by the inflight attendants was very good. The flight was the smoothest of all I had ever experienced. Even though the take off was a bit delayed the captain saw that we reach our destination on time. And the landing was the smoothest I ever experienced. The food options in their menu was also awesome.

### "not at all comfortable"
Bangalore to Hyderabad one of the worst trip I have experienced. The bus to the plane was all tightly packed and the ac was not working. Aircraft seats not at all comfortable neither the plane was cool.

### "low quality of service"
Pune to Kolkata. Lowest leg space provided by AirAsia India in the domestic sector. No self check in kiosk facility available. The seats are preassigned as per their convenience and they don't change it as per your preference at the airport. I had flown this airline last month on the same sector, but thought of giving it another chance. All I got was disappointment. Low cost but low quality of service.

### "I had to cancel my trip"
Not Verified |  I recently booked a travel from Chennai to Kochi and paid about three times the fare as excess luggage fees. But due to an emergency 3 hours prior to the departure time, I had to cancel my trip. I called the customer service and explained my situation. They didn't even offer me partial credit for a later flight. I ended up buying another ticket, at full price, including the luggage fees, for the following week. I would strongly recommend avoiding AirAsia at any cost!

### "Never ever go with AirAsia"
Goa to New Delhi. My flight I5 799 got cancelled at the last moment. Then my ordeal started to reschedule it. The customer service is totally poor. I called 6-7 times and each person gave a different story. I did a web check in before the flight got cancelled. It took them 8.5 hours to uncheck and they kept me sleepless throughout the night saying give them a call after half an hour so that they can reschedule. They don’t have any coordination and they live in a different world isolated from customers. My dream Goa trip ended a nightmare because of this poor, unorganised, stupid care persons of this worst air line. Never ever go with Air Asia!

### "like to applaud the staff"
Delhi to Kuala Lumpur. I would like to applaud the staff at the check in counter at the new Delhi airport for Air Asia. Two gentlemen in particular provided an excellent customer service in what could have become an issue for us and caused us major delays. They took extra initiative, made phone calls and assured us that the problem would be resolved soon. By keeping us in the loop and ensuring we made our next connecting flight on time. Thank you.

### "Poor seating arrangement"
Jaipur to Bangalore. Worst airline to travel. Reschedule flight 2 times. No intimation for the same. Poor seating arrangement. Bad leg space and seat recline system. Other airlines offer better leg space. Overall bad experience.

### "option in paid seats"
Jaipur to Pune. I was on a family vacation with my wife and 2 kids. I could not do web check-in and I see all the seats gray out saying seats are booked and not available. Auto allocation of seats provided my both kids seats on 3rd Row and for me and my wife in the 28th row. At the counter on airport, when I asked to provide seats for all members in one row, they say either you sit on the allocated seats or I have option in paid seats. So to sit with family I had to pay 750 RS extra.

### "seats at different places"
Bangalore to Delhi. We are a couple travelling. We are tried doing web check 10 hours before the flight and it showed us seats at different places. Hence we didn't do it. We came to counter 1 hr 30 mins before and the attendee allocated same seats which were showing while we tried web check in and she was saying no seats left, only paid seats are left. Now we have to come at least one day before to do check in.

### "really cheap tricks"
Vishakhapatnam to Bangalore. Me and my young daughter were travelling. We were given seats in different parts of the aircraft and ground staff said if we want to sit next to each other we need to pay for the seat. This is really cheap tricks. if they want us to pay for this, why don't they include in the ticket price? I will never travel AirAsia again. Pathetic

### "staff are inefficient"
Bengaluru to Chennai. We were made to wait for half an hour in the baggage drop line. Line was short, staff were inefficient. Our e-boarding pass expired before our flight and we had to get a new one with different seats. We had to wait for the bus again for 10 minutes in the hot sun before we could board the flight. We took AirAsia from Chennai to Bangalore as well. Similar experience. Staff are inefficient (ground crew) and processes terrible. Not recommended at all.

### "main problem price of food and drink"
Travelled to Banglore from Hyderabad in AirAsia. It was my first experience with them. It was a nice experience and the staff were kind and gentle. The main problem we faced was the price of food and drink. What were those prices? Those amounts were too much to be paid. We paid good amount for the travel, then why do you charge so high for food? The rest of the facilities were great.

### "arrival was not on time"
Guwahati to Delhi. The flight arrival was not on time, they said there are weather issues as reason for delay which there was not. Normal weather outside at time of landing, booked cabs missed, reached home late, was veryhungry and tired. I requested a window seat but they denied that as well.

### "Seat comfort was good"
Delhi to Pune. Overall I will say fair. LCC airline so did not purchase a meal, only a hot coffee which was very good. Seat comfort was good with good leg room for an average person. Seat do not recline at all. Cabin crew was nice. Only did not like the announcement of food standard they are using.

### "seat was really comfortable"
Bangalore to Ranchi via Hyderabad. I really thankful to all the AirAsia staff for their generous behavior, they offered me a meal (looking delicious at the pamphlet) at the time of getting the boarding pass with complementary beverages & water, and I agreed to add a meal,costs me Rs.220. I boarded my flight, seat was really comfortable, legroom were perfect, ambiance was good. The cabin crew were really cooperative. After taking off i got my meal and it was horrible. I enjoyed 2 hours of journey it was a nice experience. I have a strong desire to travel next time with Air Asia.

### "got delayed for 2.5 hours"
Delhi to Pune. Worst customer service. Flight on 31st December got delayed for 2.5 hours and delay was notified after the departure time by SMS. When I checked with the AirAsia desk about the delay, they didn't even seem to know that the flight was delayed 2.5 hours.

### "prefer AirAsia for my next trip"
I had the flight from Bangalore to Kolkata with AirAsia India. I forgot power bank in my luggage so they hold my bag at Bangalore airport and told me to sent next day. however, when I reached Kolkata one AirAsia staff attended me and I told her about the luggage I also asked her that since its connecting flight I couldn't collect my bag from Kolkata please arranged to sent it Patna my hometown. The staff spent about 1 hour with me coordinate with Kolkata Airport and finally assured me to send my luggage to my hometown. It was my fault but they handled it very politely. Thanks AirAsia and Bangalore ground staff for all your support definitely I will prefer Air Asia for my next trip.

### "missed my International flight"
Hyderabad to Kochi. AirAsia cabin crew told me that that can't give me non-veg meal because I had booked for Veg, but if I wan't I can buy veg meal separately. I got to know that the delay wasn't communicated to the connecting airline and I missed my International flight. So I had to book another ticket and Air Asia wouldn't take any responsibility for the same.

### "no more check in baggage allowed"
Bhubaneswar to Bangalore. I had done a ticket for my brother, flight time was 10pm. We reached airport at 9.20 and they denied to take the luggage as it was too late and no more check in baggages are allowed. They charged 3K for a small bag and they said if you don't wish to pay,  you can leave and come next time. And we don't have any other option rather to pay the money.

### "baggage got left behind"
The flight journey was fine. My baggage got left behind in Bangalore and I had to wait for it to arrive in the next flight and I had to travel to Abu Dhabi the next morning. They didn't even inform me. First time on AirAsia and the worst first impression.

### "happy with the travel"
Vishakhapatnam to Bangalore. I was happy with the travel. My only problem was that I could have missed the flight because the staff didn't announce properly that the boarding started. I went to the staff and asked when is the boarding getting started. Then they announced and I quote "This is a final call to all passengers traveling to Bangalore by AirAsia". Even the instructions in the flight were not properly announced. They were in a hurry to announce and complete it. Most of the passengers asked the belt number to collect baggage again to staff as we were not able to understand. We need to know and understand what is happening and what needs to be done.

### "was quite impressed"
Bangalore to Pune. This was my first time flying AirAsia and was quite impressed by the inexpensive fare and the politeness of the crew members. The scheduled departure was 0025 hours, but we departed as early as around 0015 hours when all the passengers had boarded. Though the scheduled arrival at Pune was at 0200 hours, we had landed by 0130 hours, and that half-an-hour early arrival at the destination delighted me. I found the seats respectably comfortable with decent leg-room. Personally I'd have preferred if the seats could recline a little more backward as it was a red-eye flight. And the price of food came as a disappointment, but that's pretty much the case with any other low-cost carrier.

### "never to travel via Air Asia again"
Goa to Delhi. My experience with Air Asia was terrible. I had booked a flight which was supposed to take off at 7:25pm with flight duration of 2.5 hours. It got delayed and took off at 9pm. When we land, we got to know that the flight had landed in Jaipur instead of New Delhi due to shortage of fuel. No information or clarity is being given by the crew on the take off schedule. It has been more than 30 minutes of waiting inside the airplane without any service for water or proper air conditioning in the plane. The crew shows no concern for the customers. We still don't know when will we be reaching our destination. This experience has given me a lesson never to travel via Air Asia again.

### "no option to pick a seat"
AirAsia India changed the departure time from New Delhi to Bangalore two times around 1:30hrs before departure. Check-in is good but there is no option to pick a seat while web checking. To take an aisle or window seat is chargeable around 450-660. Airline staff is good and cooperative.

### "paying almost nothing for the tickets"
Goa to Bangalore. AirAsia lures you in with the dirt cheap prices, but it may not be worth the trouble. We have an infant. The flight was delayed 2:30 hrs and no SMS or call. We get there on time for the original takeoff and we are received by belligerent employees. They have no clue about what is to follow and are passing that irritation on to us. Truly the worst experience with ground staff. No customer service or information. I guess that's what you get paying almost nothing for the tickets.

### "such a bad experience"
Goa to Delhi. First time booked the flight but such a bad experience. They keep on rescheduling the flight from 10:30 pm to the next day 3:00am, then to 8:35pm and now no such information available. Such irresponsible behavior. They just don't care about sensitivity of any person.

### "demanded seat charges"
Bangalore to Jaipur with AirAsia India. Having booked 3 tickets under one PNR code while doing Web check-in, I found my 3 allocated seats are not in a row with 1 seat in different row. I called customer care they demanded seat charges for putting all of us in the same row. I refused to pay and not chose not to continue with the Web check-in. At the airport I again asked AirAsia about getting us in a row as a family travelling together. They refused and said they can't do this without additional money. To my utter surprise, the flight was only about 70% occupy and I found the third seat in my row was empty. I will be thinking twice before travelling with AirAsia again.

### "not assisting on delays"
Delhi to Guwahati with AirAsia India. Delayed the flight with no communications to customers. The flight was scheduled for 1735 hrs, then rescheduled to 1815 hrs, then rescheduled to 1850 hrs, finally took off post 1900 hrs. Customer service at airport were not assisting with any help on delays.

### "reasonable low-fare airline"
This is the first time I'm flying with AirAsia India. Cabin cleanliness and aircraft maintenance is good. Leg room is less, overall gives a neutral opinion. The staff is very polite but seems tired. Meal is not included in the fare. Overall a very good value for money. On-time performance is good. The best price you can fly even on weekends. Very reasonable low-fare airline.

### "a wonderful experience"
This was my first time that I was travelling with AirAsia India and it so happened that while boarding the flight back from Delhi to Bangalore, and as careless it may sound but I lost my Boarding Pass somewhere on the airport. I really panicked because I had to reach Bangalore the next day. I went and talked to the staff on duty and they were really cooperative and they gave me 15 minutes to search for my boarding pass on the airport. They also copied everybody via radio regarding the missing boarding pass. While I was searching for the pass I got a call from officer on duty and he stated that they had found my boarding pass. The staff accompanied me to the aircraft and though the flight got delayed by half an hour but the ground staff made sure that I boarded the flight. All in all it was a wonderful experience travelling with AirAsia

### "flight attendants very attentive"
I had web-checked in. Aircraft inside was so clean, seats were comfortable. The flight attendants were very attentive. Although there was a delay in take off, we reached Visakhapatnam 15 mins before schedule. I will look forward to travel with them in future. The fare was also very low comparatively. I hope they introduce some aircraft in Bangalore-Kolkata route.

### "seats more comfortable than competition"
I flew AirAsia India from Jaipur to Pune. They needed 4 people per check in desk to issue one boarding pass. Had to pay extra for the seat I wanted, but they had no change to give back to me, so wasted 10 minutes looking for change. Flight was on time and boarding etc was efficient. Staff on board were friendly and seemed to giggle and laugh a lot. Nice crew, but seemingly not fussed about procedures and information to be given to passengers. Food (that you buy) was mediocre. Flight landed ahead of time and the seats seemed more comfortable than the competition.

### "don't care for one lone pax"
AirAsia India give the most uncomfortable seat to a pax who checks in early as their objective is to sell the comfortable seats (forward, aisle, windows, emergency seats with more legroom,). Later as the flight Bangalore-Pune was not full and apparently there was no upgrading of seats chosen by pax on payment, the comfortable seats were allowed to go vacant and the pax were compelled to travel in the most uncomfortable seats. It seems Air Asia have enough customers so they don't care for one lone pax.
