### "the ultimate in no frills"
Clark to Seoul Incheon. Pan Pacific advertises as a full service carrier. However this is not the case. Uses A320 aircraft that are old and very tatty. The seats are non reclining. There is no tv or in flight entertainment. There is no usb sockets or charging points. I The seat next to me didnt even have a seatbelt. Seat pitch is standard for a budget A320 with 180 seats in a 3-3 config. This is the ultimate in no frills super budget airlines. The staff do offer a very limited snack service available to purchase onboard. However if you want ice with your coke sorry not available. The food I choose ( a frankfurter bread roll) was stale and tasteless. The overall impression of this airline was one that was about to fail. Sadly that is probably the right thing to happen.
