### "no wifi or on-board entertainment"
Senegal Airlines first delayed flight 213 for five hours then said they could not take me although I had a confirmed business class ticket. I gave a reason of them having to change to a smaller plane because they could not refuel in Banjul, Gambia. They sent me and nine other passengers to the Azalai Hotel in Dakar, which was about an hour from the airport, but when we arrived at the hotel they had no reservation for any of us. The hotel required that I pay out of pocket for the room which cost 130,000 CAF (214.00 USD). Although the airline paid for the taxi to take us to the hotel. I had to pay for a taxi back to the airport. That cost 35,000 CAF (57.86 USD). I am claiming for the two costs or a total of 271.86 USD. I have been told I can be put on a flight at 5 pm tomorrow, 6 July 2024. In addition on the flight from Paris there was no wifi or on-board entertainment or working video screens and the business class seats did not full recline.

### “No communication or information”
Not Verified | After having lived in Africa for more than seven years (Mozambique) in addition to now frequently traveling for work I thought I had seen everything. In terms of poor management, traveling with Air Senegal was surprisingly bad. No communication or information, clueless staff and no compensation or willingness to assist passengers (elderly, young, families etc.). My flight from Dakar to Praia was 5hrs late, which was more than the average delay on their flights (3.5hrs). The aircraft supposed to take us to Praia departed for Conakry at the same time as we were supposed to take-off. After speaking with ground staff it became clear that it’s a management strategy/policy - they simply plan more flights (thus, sell more tickets) than their fleet is capable of handling. The operation side of the company have their hands tied as they dont have enough aircrafts or staff to operate according to the route network and timetable, which is reflected on their constant delays.
