### "I can really recommend"
Great attentive and warm service at the check in in Paris Orly airport. The agent even walked us to the special conveyor belt for extra large luggage. Pleasant experience in the lounge, enjoying breakfast with a view on the tarmac. We boarded well ahead of time, and as there are only 76 seats, that goes smoothly and without hassle. A welcome drink was offered before take off, and diner was served in two courses about 2 hours later. Before we landed, a light meal (quiche or sweet quality treat) was served. The stable Wi-Fi connection allowed to work during the flight. Seats are a classic business class seat, which can be turned into a full flat bad. Overall, considering the service and the price, I can really recommend La Compagnie.

### "airline has caused massive inconvenience and massive cost"
This company has canceled my flight from New York to Paris about a week before the departure. They then took 2-3 days to then re-book me on a different flight from New York to Nice. After re-booking ongoing flights and changing plans and spending a few thousand USD on changing everything, the company then called me in the morning to say that they overbooked me on the New York to Nice flight and that they were going to change me to a later date and route me to Paris. Even while all of this was going on, their website was still showing my original flights as available. This airline has caused massive inconvenience and massive cost to me with zero recourse and simply an apology.

### "I have never had an issue"
Not Verified |  Newark to Paris. I’ve flown them a few times and have always been very pleased with what I got versus what I paid. I flew on La Compagnie before the new A321 and it was nice. Now it’s fantastic with the flat bed. I slept a little over four hours on the flight to Paris and still got both meals. In terms of service you get business class things, but their offered in a very Coach/Economy way. For instance, when you board you get a small (basically a shot and a half) of champagne. The stewardesses don’t come around offering multiple rounds of drinks. You’re offered one drink and then maybe a digestive later, but nobody comes around offering you more and more like a standard international business class cabin. If you’re willing to go to the galley and ask they will give it to you. Sine La Compagnie sells their business class tickets at 1/3rd or less than a standard carriers I’m guessing they make some of the margins up here. I paid $1,500 for a round trip ticket with a flat bed. The lounge in Paris is pretty good. Good offerings. Nice drinks. Definitely worth 30 minutes of your time. Don’t both with the one at Newark. Food is terrible. Drinks are cheap. The space is cramped. It’s shared with El Al and in many ways resembles a Middle Eastern souk albeit with art you can buy on the walls. Shared lounges are rarely worth spending time in and this one is no different, but with the added bonus that it’s before security it’s even less worth a visit. Aim to be at the gate no sooner than boarding if flying out of Newark. I have never had an issue and have generally felt that I was getting the better half of the bargain.

### "great value for the price"
Not Verified |  I have flown 3 times on La Companie so far and could not be happier. It makes me laugh to see complaints about ground accommodations, and “old” planes etc... this is an airline that flies to a manageable airport (Orly) with lower taxes than for example CDG, it is a boutique operation with limited flights, and proposes business class flights R/T for as low as $1500 vs. $5000+ on poorer major airlines. It is great value for the price and grumpy people can still spend their $1500 on a coach ticket booked on United coping with the CDG mess, and see if they are offered hot towels, full meal, champagne, and most importantly business class seats with better air quality.

### "do not fly this amateur operation"
Not Verified |  This June [2019] we booked on La Compangnie, Newark to Paris return. Our flight over was cancelled 48 hours before departure. We had firm bookings on a flight Paris to London. La Compagnie offered us a later flight instead of Paris to Nice. Of course we could not make our Paris to London connection. We dropped that and waited until the next morning flying directly to London from Nice. We incurred an extra night's stay in Nice, taxi rides, a lost ticket from Paris to London, lost return flight [when you don't show for the first flight, you lose the return] and a lost night in our London hotel adding up to over a thousand dollars in extra costs. At the end of our stay in England and Paris, we were told that our flight from Paris to Newark was also cancelled. If we arrived at 8:00 am at Orly, we would be put on the morning flight instead of the more comfortable afternoon departure. 2 Flights for 2 people, both cancelled and we are repeat customers. The check in people at La Compangie said the company would meet us, they did not, would reimburse us if we showed receipts they did not. After multiple attempts to contact anyone by phone and waiting for 4 weeks, they more or less told us, too bad, we owe you nothing. Unless you are willing to see your flight changed with very little notice and you have a great deal of flexibility or insurance at the other end, do not fly this amateur operation.

### "finally offered a 75% credit"
I paid $1515.73 for a one way business class ticket on La Compagnie flight 0102 from Paris to New York on June 30. They swapped out the plane for a sub-economy charter without saying anything until I was on the plane, despite eight separate opportunities. They would not let me off the plane, and have ignored all phone calls, emails, and direct requests to their gate agents. La Compagnie had several opportunities to notify me of the change, but did not at any of these points. They violate their own customer service policies. After receiving no response from La Compagnie for over a month, I filed a formal complaint with the Dept of Transportation and notified some travel journalists and they finally contacted me and offered a 75% credit.

### "Not a great airline"
Paris Orly to Newark. Not a great airline at all, thirty minute wait for check in, very tired 757s (hopefully soon replaced with new 321s), poor ground facilities (ORY 4 is not great although the Icare lounge is nice, on the other way EWR terminal B was just horrible). Bland food, limited drinks, lazy and class-less crew. The key advantage is the seat, although it is worn and not fully horizontal (should be better on 321) it provides much better rest than coach or premium economy, so despite the aggravation of poor service and infrastructure we came home fine. Good amenity kit, fine entertainment, the food was better than in premium economy on other transatlantic airlines. So it feels like business for the seat and feels not great for the rest. We paid $1200 for the return flight, cannot complain about that.

### "fantastic value for business class"
Paris Orly to Newark. Longtime customer of OpenSkies (when it was business class only) and the original L'avion. Chose La Compagnie, and glad we did. Our flight was canceled at Orly back to Newark, and it was a mess - the gate agents at Orly did not speak English well, and there was lack of information given, we had to rebook 2 days later on another flight home on our own with the airline, no one at the gate could assist us with that, and they only have 2 planes, and don't partner with other airlines. 2 days stuck in Paris with hotel hopping. so why the 5 stars? The compensation when we got home to the states and quick communication and customer service was great. They offered to pay for our meals, hotels and cabs for the 2 days stuck in Paris. The flights were so comfortable, great entertainment on the flights and great food. I was able to sleep comfortably with a  pillow and the plane seemed very clean. The  flight crew was lovely both ways and couldn't have been nicer. For the price, this was a fantastic value for business class, and was much better than United First Class to Paris. I hope they stay in business!

### "customer care nonexistent"
Paris to Newark. Service on board adequate and friendly staff. But the issue was that my checked luggage did not arrive in Newark. From that moment, no feedback, customer care nonexistent. The staff was not concerned and blamed the situation on Orly airport. No support.

### "it was a delight"
Newark to Paris Orly. I booked this airline, because my family and I travel to France, once or twice a year. I decided to try this airline alone first. As I got closer to the departure, I decided to read the reviews. As you have read, there are many that are not favorable. I became nervous, because I had a small window of time for my visit this summer and I didn't want to spend it with airline drama. I also want to point out that I travel 50-60K miles per year domestically for work and that I am a Delta Status flyer. Previously I have flown Air France and Delta to Europe. My review of this airline is superb. The check in was uneventful, the lounge was busy (it's summer! ), the cabin crew were pleasant and the lite dinner (salad with large shrimp) was good. My arrival was on time (I carried on my bags). Returning, was the same; on time, pleasant and tasty. I am a seasoned traveller to know that things can go wrong; mechanical, weather, unpleasant staff and inedible food. But in this case and on my flight, it was a delight.

### "Feeling absolutely ignored"
Paris to Newark. Sitting in a lounge for hours without any information. We are told that there are delays due to possible mechanical trouble. Feeling absolutely ignored. Will never fly with this airline again!

### "they really only have 2 planes"
Newark to Paris Orly. We all know what they say "you get what you pay for". However, there is a minimum standard of respect for your customers and I believe the La Compagnie staff just does not get that. My flight last night was supposed to leave EWR at 7PM. After 3 hours of wait in this dirty lounge (with cheap wine, like dirt cheap stuff) they ended up cancelling the flight for a "mechanical" failure. The trouble here is that you kind of expect to be treated like a business class customers (your ticket says business class) but in fact you are not at all. We were offered to go to an airport hotel until they could figure something out, what we didn't know. I politely refuse the offer and went home instead. We will call you at 6am tomorrow and please be ready to go again". All right, not that bad, its 11PM i am on my way home in a Uber, I'll leave tomorrow. Guess what, none of this happened. No email, no phone call on the B plan, silence. I ended up call them, or being on hold for hours should I say. See the trouble with these little guys is that they really only have 2 planes, thats it. If one fails, you are done. This is the second time this is happening to me in a year. I am a regular on AF. Let's just be real, they are no comparison, Air France is by far better. The seats (specially the flat beds), the services, the lounges etc etc. It turned out i was offered to fly to Paris on XL (the airline) - I politely declined, changed my entire trip..

### "Worst airline experience"
Flew Newark to Paris. La Compagnie is terrible and a poor excuse for business class. The plane is old and worn, the lounge is cheap and overcrowded and the entire cabin smelled literally of urine. The staff were extremely rude, especially a staff member at Newark airport. Worst airline experience. I will never fly them again.

### "Zero service"
Newark to Paris. Cancelling flights without calling their passengers, let them arrive at the airport, inform them about the cancelled flight, with no additional detail, other than to show up following at 5am for a 7am departure, with a staff that advertises that it belongs to a 3rd party provider and relegates every question to Paris (what ever that means). Zero service.

### "An absolute disaster"
An absolute disaster. I booked a flight from Paris to NYC, I was leaving on a Sunday afternoon and booked on Saturday night. My flight (with a different airline) from Warsaw - Paris that morning was cancelled, therefore I contacted La Companie to let them know I would not make my flight. To my great surprise, their Paris office was closed on Sundays and their voicemail stated that the NYC office opened at 9am which would have been an hour after the scheduled flight. When I was finally able to reach out to a representative, they gave me the run around and finally said "sorry, it was a no show". I tried explaining them several times that I had no way of contacting them to reschedule since their office was closed. They were  rude over the phone and claimed they would call me, but never did. When I finally reached out one more time to get my flight reimbursed, they once again blew me off with no rational explanation. As the saying goes "you get what you pay for". While it's cheaper than a business class seat on a real airline, it's NOT worth it.

### "leg room was ample"
I had a perfect round trip flight from Newark to Paris and back on La Compagnie. Both flights left on time and arrived on time. Check-in was drama free, and we enjoyed the use of private lounges in both Newark and Paris before boarding the flight. The food offering on both legs was very good, and the wines served were excellent. The seat reclines into a near flat bed, and was comfortable enough to actually get some sleep on the flight to Paris. In the sitting position the seat was quite comfortable, unlike most airline seats, and leg room was ample. The cabin crew on both legs was terrific, they could not have been more helpful and polite. I suppose the only "flaws" would be that the movie selection was sparse (I didn't partake, so that didn't bother me in the least) and there was no WiFi (to the extent that works on airplanes). I would definitely recommend La Compagnie - it is excellent value. I flew Open Skies quite frequently to Paris before they were acquired by BA, and La Compagnie definitely fills the void. I also found Newark to be much easier to navigate than JFK in terms of the security screening and the immigration/customs process. My flight landed at 5pm and I had collected my bag and completed the entry formalities in about 50 minutes, which had to be a record.

### "Great from beginning to end"
Newark to Paris. Great experience from beginning to end. This is what all airlines should aspire to. It could be that I have gotten used to being treated like dirt by the major US airlines and my expectations are so low but this absolutely blows away any business class service that carriers like American Airlines provide to Europe and its a fraction of the cost. $1,600 vs over $5,000 for American Airlinesbusiness class. The service was excellent all around, the equipment was a 757 that was completely retrofitted with new fully adjustable seats, and the staff was very friendly and professional. The American carriers should be embarrassed. My only complaints is the limited destinations. Please reestablish the London route and expand into EU.

### "trip delightful and a bargain"
Newark to Luton. Our experience with La Compagnie was wonderful. We purchased our tickets during one of the sales specials, so the cost was about equal to economy on other airlines and less than premium economy offered by some. Check in at Newark and Paris CDG was fast with no lines with courteous and friendly staff members. We took advantage of the lounge in Newark and the only quibble was its location before security. The lounge was clean with comfortable seating and a decent-to-very good selection of food and drink. Onboard we found the seats quite comfortable with unbelievable leg room and width. The controls were a bit fiddly to figure out, but soon found comfortable settings for sitting and sleeping. Note that the seats aren't proper flat bed, but we found them close enough to sleep comfortably. We liked the tablet entertainment for its flexibility - you can hold it on your lap for more comfortable viewing. The selection of entertainment was somewhat limited, but we didn't find this to be a terrible drawback. The noise-cancelling headphones were fairly good and did the job. Certainly they were not as good as my $300 Bose, but better than others I've tried. The meals were surprisingly good - as good or better than we've experienced in first class on some airlines, with the French attention to detail and presentation. The only minor nit on board was the attendant to passenger ratio. The plane only has 74 seats, but only had three flight attendants. This seemed to contribute to a drink and food service that took a bit longer than one would find in business class on other airlines. All in all, our trip on La Compagnie was delightful and a bargain compared to other airlines. Is it the same as business or first class on the major airlines? Of course not. But even at full-fare, La Compagine provides nearly as good an experience at a fraction of the cost. We've already booked a trip to Paris with them.

### "just endured a horror story"
Newark to Paris. Our family has just endured a horror story at the hands of La Compagnie that I feel compelled to share with fellow travelers. We had a flight reservation from Newark to Paris scheduled for February 2nd. We booked it several months back, and applied a $600 ticket coupon we were given as a result of a 6 hour delayed flight on March 20th 2016. The tickets were $3200 total so less the $1200 voucher we paid $2000 for the tickets. One of our adult children suffers from mental illness. Regrettably she has taken a turn for the worse and on the advice of her doctors and therapists we had to delay our trip to France. I called La Compagnie’s customer service and explained the situation to a representative who was very understanding. She told me we could rebook our flight up to the day of the flight without any penalties. Accordingly I called last week to try and rebook for a later date several months from now when we felt it would be ok for us to go. I was told I was misinformed by the first agent, and that in fact there would be a $500 per ticket per flight booking penalty totaling $2000. The tickets were worth $1600 each including the vouchers, so our tickets were essentially worthless. Obviously I was shocked and confused. Luckily our credit card has cancellation insurance. I contacted them and was told that I needed to provide the flight cancellation email and a copy of La Compagnie’s flight cancellation policy in order to issue a refund for the $2000. I immediately called La Compagnie and told them I was cancelling the flight, and asked for this information. The customer service representative who I was working with said she would get me that information immediately. One week has passed, and despite calling pretty well every day, I still have not received what is a routine piece of information. Upon speaking with her, (they know me by name now) she said that they have no way to contact La Compagnie in France except by email, and that she has emailed the “Cancellation Department” several times per day and taken every step she could think of but no one would respond to her. It’s now February 3rd, the flight was last night, they never cancelled our reservation and I now fear I will not be able have the claim fulfilled. It’s infuriating. This is a company with 2 planes and they can’t deal with my request? On the topic of the voucher, I asked if we could get and extension on the voucher due to what was happening. I offered to supply La Compagnie letters from our daughter’s doctors to confirm her diagnosis and current condition. Again, the customer service staff at La Compagnie were very understanding and compassionate and two of them I spoke with confided that they had family members that suffered from mental illness and that they would do their best to get an extension. In this case there was an immediate answer from France. No. No exceptions, no accommodations, the vouchers expire on March 20th. So here we are likely out of pocket for $3200. We have enough to deal with in our family and to be treated so callously and indifferently is simultaneously appalling, and frankly cruel. The Customer Service department has been wonderful and apologized to me repeatedly and said they are as frustrated as I am that no one will answer their requests. We obviously will never fly on La Compagnie again. As a former business owner I have never witnessed such incompetence and callousness.

### "an absolute disaster"
An absolute disaster! I booked a flight from Paris to New York, I was leaving on a Sunday afternoon and booked on Saturday night. My flight (with a different airline) from Warsaw to Paris that morning was cancelled, therefore I contacted La Companie to let them know I would not make my flight. To my great surprise, their Paris office was closed on Sundays and their voicemail stated that the NYC office opened at 9am which would have been an hour after the scheduled flight. When I was finally able to reach out to a representative, they gave me the run around and finally said "sorry, it was a no show". I tried explaining them several times that I had no way of contacting them to reschedule since their office was closed. They were extremely rude over the phone and claimed they would call me, but never did. When I finally reached out one more time to get my flight reimbursed, they once again blew me off with no rational explanation. I would highly suggest that anyone who is considering using La Compagnie in the future does their due diligence. There are several other airlines offering business class seats for the same price with a far superior customer service.

### "service almost non-existent"
Paris to New York with La Compagnie. To say I was disappointed with my experience is an understatement. Firstly the entertainment system is totally useless, an entire 8 hour flight without entertainment. Also 30 minutes before landing the Samsung tablets were turned off so we couldn't track our progress coming into land. The plane was filthy (we flew from Paris, which is their base airport so you would think extra care would be taken in cleaning) my partners so called clean blanket had clumps of hair all over it, there was crumbs around my seat and there was dust all around my seat. The food was passable at best. Although I have had better food on a short haul economy flight. The cabin crew crew service was poor, although friendly. Apart from the dinner service the service was almost non-existent. Apart from dinner the crew never asked us if we wanted any drinks and we felt awkward in asking for one. Also the crew seemed to ignore our call button, which was extremely infuriating. We were in the air almost 1 hour before beig offered a proper drink. The seats were OK in comfort but once made into a bed they were rather uncomfortable. They are not lay flat, with your legs being in a much lower position creating a very odd sleeping position. The toilets were horrendous as halfway through the flight one decided to stop flushing creating a very nasty surprise for all those who dare venture in. I found the flight to be extremely disappointing. In my view this is not a business class airline but a premium economy airline with extra legroom. The price was the only saving grace for this airline. But with the flight experience I had I foresee this airline will not be around for very long.

### "my flight was cancelled"
Newark to Paris. I booked the flight back in June 2016, a couple of weeks later I received an email that my flight was cancelled for 2 September 2016 due to planned mechanical work for the plane and had to reschedule the flight. I had two connecting flights that I had to rebook to accommodate the change but I had to pay both airlines $200 each to rebook. I asked for help from La Compagnie but all they would say was they were sorry even though they are the ones to cancel the original flight 2 months out. To top matters, I had to return home early and changed days to return thru La Compagnie and they charged me $800 to change. I asked for some help with the $800 fee. I mentioned the cost of the original flight changes cost to me and again all I received was "I am sorry but nothing I can do".

### "flight attendants were polite and friendly"
Just stepped off our return trip from Paris to Newark with La Compagnie. Overall, great experience both ways across the Atlantic. Both flights departed and arrived on time. Check in was a breeze at both airports and you can't beat the priority boarding. The lounge in Newark was better than the one in Paris. The Paris lounge was crowded with little selection on food and drinks. Once on board, the flight attendants were polite and friendly even with my crazy toddler. The food was okay and the Seats were comfy. The slight angle wasn't an issue for getting rest. For this price, this value can't be beat and I would definitely fly them again for pleasure or business. If you are worried about flight changes, I think the London route is more likely to get delayed or canceled. We met travelers in the lounge who were waiting for a flight to London since the day before.

### "a ton of legroom"
We heard about this new airline and decided to give it a try. The price seemed quite reasonable for what we were getting. This is an all business class airline. The price was not much more than flying economy on other airlines. We read the reviews and were aware of time changes and flight cancellations that have occurred in the past. This was not a business trip, so we were a bit flexible. We flew from Newark to London and then back a week later. Our flight out to London was delayed by about an hour, but we got plenty of notice and it did not affect it one bit. On the way home, our flight took off a couple of hours early, but again we got plenty of notice of the flight change. Truth is the early departure worked better for us, so we were not unhappy with the change. Check in went very smoothly. No lines and the staff were very courteous and friendly. We were traveling light, 2 suitcases between 3 of us, but it is nice to know that if we decided to buy something large, it could fly back with us as a piece of luggage. Once checked in we went straight for the lounge. Nothing special, but much better than siting in the regular waiting area. You get some decent food and drink before you board. If you wait till the end, someone will come around and remind you when it is boarding time. As a business class passenger you get to take the short security line. Truth is that at both Luton and Newark, it did not make a big difference as lines at both airports were short. Apparently this airline has two Boeing 757 planes. We rode on both. On the way to London we rode on the newer plane. The seats are so much nicer than any I have been in before. They have a ton of legroom, I could not touch the seat in front of me. The seats go almost flat. The seat controls are not intuitive, but you can figure them out if you play with the controls enough. The most important controls are the ones that convert the seat to a bed and the one that converts it back to a seat. The newer 757 is nicer. It has more bathrooms and there are no wires to charge the entertainment tablets. The seats also end up a bit flatter in bed mode. Entertainment wise, you get a nice big Samsung tablet. On the older plane where the tablets need to be plugged in, quite a few were running out of battery during our flight. A bit annoying, but if you kept the tablet in the cradle in front of the seat and left it plugged in, it was not an issue. The selection of entertainment was a bit slim. There were 6 TV shows to watch and about a dozen movies. Lucky for me there were a couple of movies I hand not yet seen so I was kept entertained. Food wise, no matter what this is airline food and it is not fine dining. With that said, they did the best they could. The fruit was very fresh and the deserts were really nice. Another nice touch was real silverware and cloth napkins. I'm not a drinker, so I can't comment on the wine and champagne offered on the flight. When I shop for anything, I look at value for the money spent, not just the cheapest price. Value wise I would rate this airline very high. There are only 76 passengers per flight, so you don't feel like cattle getting herded to the slaughter house. The staff is very well trained and friendly. If you don't mind the chance of a flight change, the value is hard to beat. I would use La Compagnie again.

### "terrific value - far from perfect"
Luton to Newark with La Compagnie. The flights were great value at £1178 return even though things are not perfect. Outward Luton - Newark we departed on time. It is easy to get to Luton Airport by train and bus but I was glad it was a sunny day as there is quite a long walk from the bus with no protection to the airport entrance. I would hate to do it on a rainy day. The check in staff were charming. The airport was crowded as was the lounge which was was adequate, showers were available but there was only 30 minutes of free wifi and getting a connection was complex. The aircraft looked less than half full. The service was charming and the food was excellent. The seat had baffling controls and it took half the flight to get it to a comfortable position. There were no instructions for operating the seat and the flight attendant didn't know how either. Return flight left and arrived about an hour late and was full. It was a different aircraft and the seal controls were simpler. It seemed that most passengers avoided dinner and went to sleep as soon as possible. I had an aisle seat and fortunately the window seat passenger didn't want to leave her seat at any point. Had she wanted to I would have had to wake up and move my seat to the sitting position. The service was fine and the breakfast was satisfactory despite featuring a very rubbery egg dish. I hope La Compagnie remains viable as I may happy to accept the trade-off between comfort, low price, marginal imperfections and unreliability - but first I want to try Norwegian Air to see how it compares for value for money. Anyone planning to use the La Compagnie needs to check the frequency of flight cancellations. I wouldn't have used it if I couldn't have accommodated a 24 delay for each journey. I was luck. Maybe it is improving - I hope so.

### "a terrible experience"
We are very seasoned travelers and decided to try La Compagnie to Paris from Newark. Our outbound flight was a terrible experience: uncomfortable seats with bizarre controls, poor onboard service (due to lack of staff), bad food. Our (attempted) return was an even worse experience. La Compagnie is a discount carrier, pure and simple - and not worth the price.

### "overjoyed to find them"
La Compagnie offers business class at a competitive price. They own two airplanes, and fly two routes. They are a new venture. At 6’ 3” tall, I was overjoyed to find them, after years of Transatlantic travel stuffed in the back of horrid airbuses. In a nutshell: La Compagnie delivers. Outbound: Travel to London Luton: 45 mins. (Same to Heathrow, avg. 1.5 hrs). Met at the door by La Compagnie staff. Whisked straight to the First Class lounge which was ok. Later, walked down to the gate, no one waiting, straight on board into a seat that’s like a lazy boy recliner. Greeted and served by the friendliest staff. Served fresh foods and cheeses. Woke up in NYC feeling great. Even the travel times were good, keeping us out of rush hour in NYC. Inbound: Got a text of a delay. At airport, after a bit of a wait, the CEO came down to inform of cancellation. We were taken to the nearby Ramada Inn, given rooms and food. Next day, we were visited at the hotel, again, in person by the CEO and his sales manager. We were given seats on the next flight out that evening and we arrived at the airport, and were taken back to the Newark First Class lounge (which is not great, I must say, but it’s a waiting room). Then, we went straight up to catch our business class flight home. No fuss, no problem. I am grateful to have a service that allows me to travel comfortably, with dignity, at a slightly higher price. I found the comments about the seats ‘not lying flat’ silly. I accepted that this was a boutique airline, had two planes – I knew what I was buying. La Compagnie. I’ll be back.

### "exceeded our expectations"
Before traveling I was a little concerned that La Compagnie had had a number of delays and cancellations when they first operated this service, but decided to risk it. Our flight was on time in both directions. Check in at Luton and Newark took less than a minute each time. They lounges at both ends were decent and comfortable. I am fortunate enough to fly BA Club Class and Virgin Upper class regularly, lets not get confused that La Compagnie is comparable to Upper class, but its not far away from BA Club. The plane was spotlessly clean, cabin crew were pleasant, helpful, friendly and efficient. The food was certainly as good as BA Club, possibly better. The quality of wines and champagne was good, although there wasn't a choice. The seats are very roomy and comfortable, but they don't go flat to 180 degrees - however we knew that and actually did have some sleep on the way back. I assume the cost to upgrade the plane when it was refurbished by La Compagnie to have full flat beds, was just too expensive. We paid £1500 for two persons returns, which is a phenomenal bargain and would happily have paid more. There were about 40 passengers on both trips. We found the films loaded on the Samsung Galaxy tablets more than acceptable and the viewing experience as good as any business class. All in all La Compagnie way exceeded our expectations and I would thoroughly recommend them. Will they thrive and survive is the big question and time will tell.

### "recommend and fly them again"
Return flights from Luton to New York for 4 of us. Flight was cancelled with a flight rebooked to fly 12 hours later. We were advised a couple of weeks in advance so didn't cause any problems, but a little irritating. Swift check in, lounge at Luton was fine (used it before as priority pass holders). The flight was excellent. Seats were comfortable and reclined (although not full flat) to be suitable to sleep. Pleasant staff who were attentive and discreet throughout. Champagne and very nice meal with choice of wines. Samsung Galaxy pads enabled viewing of limited films, magazines etc. Dozed off and woken by staff offering refreshments. Newark arrival processes swift and easy. Return check in similar. Lounge busy but adequate seating with plenty of refreshments. As it was a night flight, light meal, okay but not exciting then went to sleep.. Although there appeared to be only 3 staff, they were charming and efficient. Hugely impressed by La Compagnie. The flight both ways was a pleasure and would recommend and fly with them again.

### "seat controls were sticky"
We flew for the first time with La Compagnie in February 2016 from Luton to Newark and were extremely disappointed. The seat area on both outbound and inbound flights were disgusting. The seat controls were sticky, stained and seat coverings were stained. Quite evident it had been like that for months. We had to ask a hostess for wipes to clean the area again. We are frequent travellers and can honestly say that low cost airlines are far cleaner than La Compagnie. We will never use them again.

### "be aware they only have 2 aircraft"
Luton to Newark with La Compagnie. Lots to impress if all goes to plan, but be aware that they only have 2 aircraft (and one runs the Paris route) and no spare crew in the UK. Price are reasonable. Lounges not as luxurious as some but they beat sitting in departures area. Aircraft with big seats and loads of space, but seats don't quite go flat. Attentive crew. Food excellent but not much choice and not overly generous with the booze. Tablets instead of seat-back tv's, they worked well on way out but had to be plugged into chargers on the way back. Movie/music choices limited. I would have been impressed with the package/price had not a crew member gone sick. After 8 hours sitting in the business class lounge we were eventually told at 9pm that the flight was cancelled. Irate passengers and disorganised ground crew battled it out. We were told that we could be put on the next days flight but they admitted they didn't know if there would be a seat for everyone. We were sent back to baggage claim and then check in and told that the reason we were waiting was so that they could book us hotel rooms, but they hadn't yet collected the form which asked if we needed one or if we would rather do something else. Many people had had enough and headed for Heathrow but it was too late to get there and fly out that night. We stayed and were eventually taken to a budget hotel in Stevenage (35 min drive in a taxi) which was better than it sounds and flew on the next day punctually. Fortunately for us we had no time constraints and the airline were happy to change our return flight to 24 hrs later. La Compagnie offered us a gift for the inconvenience of the delay, £440 off our next flight (but not to be used on the return leg apparently) and we have since discovered this is in lieu of the EU statuary compensation of E600 (which in fact converts at £480). Discussions continue. Despite all that went wrong I liked the convenience of flying from Luton and I liked the food and the flight but we had the time on our side. We ended up with the same deal but with an additional overnight in Stevenage so I would fly with them again. In summary, in my opinion its great if all goes to plan but there is no satisfactory back up if things go wrong.

### "helpful and friendly staff"
Luton to Newark return with La Compagnie. The deal of business class flight with five nights at a central NYC hotel was right up our street. It turned out to be a very successful and enjoyable. The flights were very good and punctual. Helpful and friendly staff, very comfortable seats, good entertainment but the food was the star. Delicious and well presented. We used the business class lounges and at Newark our boarding card got us 20% duty free discount. Highly recommended.

### "food was excellent"
Have read reviews for La Compagnie and come to the conclusion that some people are really picky. We went to New York from London for a quick weekend break so time was precious, was a bit worried about comments regarding cancelled flights but apart from an hour's delay leaving Luton and half an hour leaving Newark no problem. I like the fact that everyone has the same seat, it made for a very egalitarian atmosphere and our fellow travellers were noticeably less tense and anxious than travellers we have encountered in the three class type of flight. Seats were very comfortable, I enjoyed the elevated position in recline, followed by the downward swoop into flat (OK so not totally flat but around 165 degrees I would say and plenty long enough for me to stretch out comfortably). The plane was about half full so loads of extra pillows and blankets if needed to really make your nest. The staff were fab and very French (I mean this in a good way!). Food was excellent on both trips - not sure what people have moaned about quantity as it was way too much for me on the return leg. Champagne was a good marque and the wine also of good quality. Very happy with the tablet provided. There were at least two Oscar nominated films which I had not seen and wanted to as well as other interesting items and given that I wanted to sleep on the way back, plenty of entertainment for me. If the company can increase the size of it's fleet it would be a no-brainer for anyone wanting to travel business class to New York. On the ground side, excellent lounge in Luton. The one in Newark was less swish but perfectly adequate. Having priority clearance for security was a nice bonus and we shot through both times. Luggage collection was also very quick at both ends so all in all an excellent experience.

### "would travel this company again"
Luton to Newark with La Compagnie. We paid £750 return each and it was worth every penny.The plane was a Boeing 757 with only about 70 seats in total. Each seat reclines to practically a flat bed which means you can get some sleep if needed. The staff were very friendly and the food was superior to that of other airline's premium economy offerings. We felt we were looked after from the check in procedure to the lounge in both Luton and Newark. Overall we would travel with this company again.

### "deserve to succeed"
Luton to New York (Newark) with La Compagnie, taking advantage of their offer of return trip for 2 for £1700. Having read some previous adverse comments about this airline, we were somewhat apprehensive about what to expect. I have to say, however that our fears were unfounded. The whole experience - apart from the state of Luton Airport, which is not La Compagnie's fault - was very pleasant. The aircraft, which was immaculate, was not full on either leg, and the stewardesses, in their very smart uniforms, were friendly and most helpful. Indeed, service was excellent throughout, and food and wine were very good, albeit the coffee was tepid. Inflight entertainment is somewhat limited but was sufficient for a 7-hour flight. We found the reclining seats comfortable with plenty of position options. Check in at Luton and customs and security screening was very efficient using the fast track lane, and the newly refurbished Aspire Lounge is very comfortable. Overall, La Compagnie offers excellent value for money and gives passengers who might otherwise travel in cramped economy class greater comfort and a more personal level of service for a little more than the cost of an economy class ticket. It is early days for the company and, hopefully, the occupancy rate on their flights will pick up and thus make it a viable financial venture. They certainly deserve to succeed.

### "never fly La Compagnie again"
I recently purchased tickets to New York with La Compagnie for my girlfriends Christmas present. I really would not recommend this airline. I am not generally one to write negative reviews or be overly critical but feel compelled to in this instance. Firstly the positives - nice aircraft, good lie flat beds. The negatives : the website would not work to check in. The flight which was only about 20% full both directions had appalling service - the crew were surly and it was almost an inconvenience for them to serve you. I really cannot underestimate this, and without doubt they were the worst on any airline I have been on. I got the distinct impression they were trying to limit liquid refreshments to passengers. While the food out to New York was great, coming back was the worst food I've ever encountered on any airline, economy or not. And I am including intra-Europe short haul flights in this. We had a horrible quiche, which was sweet and soggy. There was no other option and it was cold. I noticed that the crew dinner was distinctly better and also hot! I should also note that while there was a choice of main on the way out and I got my chosen dinner, other passengers did not which is unacceptable when paying the price for this flight and looking for a business experience. Fish was compulsory on both meals, and while I like fish, other passengers I spoke to left their meals. There was an inability to serve hot coffee - on the occasions where customers pressed their 'call' button the crew did not attend to them. I am sure this is a must given that a passenger could have a serious health problem etc. While the tablets are sold as a positive they are awful. The sound doesn't work, and we had 4 occasions between us where the battery ran out and the crew simply exchanged with other empty seats. If the flight was full I can only guess you would be out of luck. In short, if you are looking for a competitively priced business flight to sleep only, you'll probably be fine. If you are looking to be treated well, you will be sorely disappointed. And then again if I were flying out on business and your company is paying, I can't imagine why you would choose this airline. I do not often say such grandiose comments, but without doubt I would never fly La Compagnie again.

### "not worth the inconvenience"
I'm really persevering with this airline, despite some bad experiences. The latest was a few days ago when the London flight was cancelled at 24 hours notice and I was offered the Paris flight instead, with assistance back to London. This is the second time they have brought the flight forward which meant my connecting flight into Newark would be too late. The first time I re booked at a cost of $300, this time at such short notice the cost would have been a lot more. I declined and flew Economy on another airline. So wasting a $350 ticket on United. Twice in the past my La Compagnie flights have been cancelled altogether, one with no notice (I found out at check in) the other at two weeks notice. Not only does this constant rescheduling cost money, I also have to rearrange hotels, car rental etc. Once on Board, the service, food and comfort is more than acceptable and for the price, excellent. But unless they can guarantee better reliability, no matter how inexpensive they are, it's just not worth the inconvenience.

### "it's a good product"
We were fortunate to be able to take advantage of the Summer offer to New York and back, £800 each. (On the day of flying I checked with BA, their (admittedly fully flexible) Economy seat was £1,200). Check in at Luton was simple and very friendly, the newly refurbished Aspire lounge is good. Welcomed on board by a very smart crew, only 30 of the 74 seats taken. The seats are, well, oldish style Business class, only angle flat - La Compagnie advertising please note. The food was very good; on the return, overnight flight, a simple light supper was served, which was perfect - other airlines please note. The entertainment was limited, but not bad for just a 7 hour flight. We had problems outbound with seats not reclining properly, inbound was, I think, a newer refurbishment, and the seats were fine. OK, it's not Emirates or Singapore, but neither are the prices and it's certainly far better than Economy or that con perpetrated by other airlines, 'Premium' Economy. I just hope that La Compagnie can do the business, I remember that the other Luton based business airlines, Silverjet and EOS, didn't make it. La Compagnie deserves to - it's a good product and for us was a great and inexpensive way to start a holiday in great comfort.

### "all business without flat beds"
I flew to New York to work but didn't have the budget for a business class fare so decided to try the  La Compagnie. The booking process was truly frustrating: their website would not accept my contact details and than it would not accept my payment card. I had to phone La Compagnie twice. They did answer the phone but the whole booking process took 45 minutes. Once my booking was made I was sent an email advising me to download an app for up-to-date flight info. This app did not work (more time annoyingly wasted). I tried to join their frequent flyer programme but was refused. The online check-in facility didn't work, so I phoned them again and was told that I would have to check in at the airport. My first dread was getting to Luton Airport. This was surprisingly easy. There is a fast train (20 minutes) every hour from St Pancras. The eventual destination of the train is Nottingham (I think), so my point is that people book seats. I was lucky to get a seat - next time I will book. There is less luggage storage space on the train that you would find on an airport shuttle like the Heathrow Express. Then you have to get onto a rather horrible shuttle bus to the terminal (this bus seemed a whole lot more horrible following an overnight flight on the return journey). Once at the terminal I walked to the desk and was checked in within about 30 seconds. A couple of words about Luton Airport: there are more people smoking outside the terminal than there are checking in inside. The company that operate currency exchange at Luton (ICE) offered a rate of USD 1.34 when the actual rate was 1.54 and than charged a whopping 3% commission on top! Luton Airport is currently undergoing remodelling so there were lots of hoardings, walkways and noise. I went through security on the fast track (really quick) and didn't try the business lounge. There was no sky bridge for boarding so we walked downstairs and crossed the tarmac with umbrellas. I quite liked that as it reminded me of my childhood. The plane is a Boeing 757 and looks box fresh. The blue grey colour scheme is soothing. There are 78 seats in a 2-2 configuration. The cabin crew are dressed in super-smart outfits and were welcoming without being overly solicitous. (On the return flight they remembered and greeted me - nice touch). The amenities bag is a stylish canvas job with Caudalie products and all the usual stuff. The IFE is provided by a tablet that you can remove from the back of the seat. No latest releases but every James Bond movie ever made! I imagine that you would soon tire of the selection if you flew regularly on this route. Food was good, simple and fresh. The seats - most important thing. The seats are 'angled' and not flat beds. So, although one can stretch out, getting truly comfortable enough to sleep properly is impossible for me. I propped my feet up on pillows and then bolstered my body with yet more pillows but this assumes an unlimited pillow supply to be comfortable - which would not be available if the flight were full. Why on earth did they not take the opportunity of launching a new, all business, airline with flat beds? I want La Compagnie to be successful and to keep fares low. At a price that wasn't far above BA Premium Economy this is an absolutely brilliant way to travel. However if fares start to climb La Compagnie will not be able to compete on comfort, service or convenience.

### "Would I use again? No way!"
After check in, proceeded to gate to learn my La Compagnie flight had been cancelled due to technical issue. Were directed to lounge where deputy CEO explained that 20 seats were available on the evening flight to Paris. If we took this, they would arrange onward flight to London. Hence ended up flying (with delay) to Paris, where on arrival, we were given vouchers for a Eurostar train to St. Pancras. No mention of any onward transport to Luton. Real story: The Luton bound plane had no technical issue, but the plane for Paris had. Because of higher seat booking on Paris flight, La Compagnie decided to use the Luton plane and fly to Paris instead (since it would be cheaper to transport 20 passengers from Paris to London, than 35 passengers from Luton to Paris!). Filed compensation request (under EU law). Was offered a $650 voucher. I declined this - who knows if they are still in business when I want to use voucher?. After various email exchanges and threat to file formal complaint with CAA, eventually La Compagnie agreed to credit card refund of Euro 600. Since they only have 2 planes, any technical issue translates into delay or cancellation. Okay this happens, but be honest about it and don't lie to me by claiming that you are doing me a favor by flying me to Paris when you just took my perfectly good plane to London away! Food service on board - eat before you depart! General service requires improvement (they're specialists in ignoring you!). Seat comfort is okay, but not a 180 deg recliner Leg Room is excellent Would I use them again? No way!

### "worth the money"
Newark to Paris CDG with La Compagnie, and worth the money. That is saying a lot because I am a frugal person. Professional flight crew, food was great, gourmet and unique to the French culture. The reclining seat was the best part. The I-pad was just a so-so feature.

### "lost confidence with La Compagnie"
My La Compagnie flight from Newark to Luton on 15th October was cancelled one hour before the flight was due to leave, technical fault. Promises of being sent the next night, 24 hours later. Eventually put in hotel by La Compagnie and assured we'd receive communication the next day. No communication whatsoever, all chasing done by passengers. Passengers not advised, not answering emails either. Lunch time of 16th told flight (after my call to them) would leave following morning at 7.15 am - approx. 33 hours after original flight. Offered at 5.00 pm on 16th a flight to Paris for that evening. Too late and lost confidence with La Compagnie - flew with Virgin back home.

### La Compagnie customer review
La Compagnie from Luton to New York was excellent. Easy and friendly check-in, fast track through security. Lounge at Luton currently WIP but when finished will be good - plenty to eat and drink. Walk from lounge onto plane - only downside no jetty. Plane only 60% full so made it feel even more exclusive. Quiet, calm and relaxing. French flight attendants very professional. Good food and drink, slept 4 hours and I had no problem with the angled seat. They now have a proper amenity kit. Best part from the arrival gate to taxi at Newark just 30 mins including picking up luggage. Great flight times - leaves 5.45pm out of Luton so can work most of the day and into New York by 9pm. Amazing value and excellent experience.

### "reclining seats, great service"
Just completed a round-trip on La Compagnie. The upgraded setting is wonderful, less than 80 passengers per plane, reclining seats, great service. Their schedules are a problem - delayed both ways, and late schedule change because they sometimes combine the flight returning from Europe. We missed our connecting flight but they put us up in a hotel.

### "our experience was very positive"
We booked 2 tickets to Newark with La Compagnie on a special offer (2 seats for a little over £1600). Our experience was very positive (I do wonder what some people expect sometimes). The lounge at Luton Airport is not on par with Virgin lounges at Heathrow or Gatwick, and Luton airport serves charter and low cost flights. There was some upgrade work taking place when we flew out which was a little noisy, and the lounge was somewhat full as it accepts Priority Pass holders but we found a seat and it was adequate for our needs. Check in was smooth and painless with the advantage of using a priority security clearance lane, where everybody was polite and jolly which was a pleasant change. We were called to the gate from the lounge just before boarding with the gate being a short walk from the lounge. We were offered drinks before take off - cranberry juice with or without champagne and handed amenity kits which contained all the basics (socks, eye mask, earplugs, toothbrush and toothpaste, moisturiser etc) - again I have read criticisms in some reviews. The cabin crew on both trips were extremely polite and attentive (both legs had empty seats which is a bit of a concern because I hope La Compagnie are successful with the Luton to Newark route). The Captain was very jolly, again a nice touch. All the food I tried was delicious - we had one gluten free meal and one regular. A small basket of "snacks" was put out for anybody who had room for nibble during the outbound flight (mars bars, kit-kats, haribos) but I didn't notice anything similar on the return (everybody was sleeping so probably not required). It took me a while to get the hang of the seat positioning controls, but I find my mobile difficult to get to grips with. The bed doesn't lie flat completely horizontally but I was still able to sleep (I put my back and a spare pillow at the foot of the seat to raise my legs a little). I liked using the tablet and whilst the latest block busters were missing, I was able to keep myself entertained with the films which were available (and I loaded a couple to my iPad just in case but didn't really need them). Even Newark customs security was having a good day - within 20 minutes of landing we were waiting for our car in the arrivals hall. The lounge a Newark on the flight home is before security but does not present a problem. You can get a hot meal but the nibbles are very limited. Again we were called to our flight by the staff in the lounge and it only took about 10 mins to get through security (a much less jolly experience than Luton!) after the short walk from the lounge. I have flown first and business class with other airlines (AA, BA and Virgin) and considering the cost of the tickets and service we received I was delighted.

### La Compagnie customer review
Fantastic airline featuring Business Class only seats, flying from Luton to Newark. We paid about £900 each return, cheaper than BA economy on the dates we flew. It is a small airline but one of the best flights I've had. It's not going to compete with the likes of Qatar Airways but you can't beat the value. The seats aren't completely lie flat but the seat pitch is 60" and very acceptable. The staff were exceptional and the experience was like being a guest on a small family outing. They couldn't do enough to help and we were really impressed. I hope they succeed.
