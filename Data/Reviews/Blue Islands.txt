### "Comfortable enough flight"
Not Verified |  Comfortable enough flight which was fairly on time. We were surprised that there was no catering on this flight of about 2 hours. Only took hand baggage.

### "not eligible for any compensation"
I was on the 09:00 SI 2258 flight to BHX from Jersey on 01/12/21. There was a technical fault and we had to turn around. This flight was then cancelled and I collected my luggage with no instruction as to what to do next. So I called Blue Islands and spoke to a representative who said the best she could do was put me on another flight SI 5554 to East Midlands due to leave at 14:10, but this was further delayed until 15:25. I landed at East Midlands at approximately 16:40. I then had to get a taxi to Birmingham airport costing me £89.22 meaning I did not get back to my car until around 19:00. I was given the impression by the representative that I would be eligible for some compensation to cover my extra expenses and time and that I should keep my receipts. That did not turn out to be the case. As Blue Islands operate outside of EU regulations I was not eligible for any compensation as per their terms and conditions. I double checked this a they were technically correct so I asked if it would be possible to have my taxi fee refunded at least as none of this was my fault. This was refused and simply said I should take it up with my travel insurance. It is neither their or my fault that I am out of pocket. I've never known such poor customer service from a company. At least 6 of us fly to Jersey every year and we will certainly not be using Blue Islands again.

### Blue Islands customer review
Jersey to Southampton. I bought duty free onboard using my debit card. They wrote down my card details and asked me to sign as they did not have a card machine. On checking my account, i had been charged twice. I know these things happen so i emailed, bearing in mind this was the 22nd december, and i did not receive a reply for 3 weeks. In this email i enclosed a picture of the receipt and a picture of my bank statement showing that it had been charged twice and the email described how this often happened when pending and that it should sort itself out, which was utter rubbish as it wasn't even pending at this point! Emailed twice more and nothing since. Advice for anyone else is to not use your cards onboard!

### "An utter disgrace"
❎ Unverified |  An utter disgrace. Flight departed Jersey late as heavy fog over Southampton was making landing impossible. A break in the weather meant that the pilots decided to give it a try. As it transpired, by the time we reached Southampton, the fog had resettled and we weren't going to be able to land. The flight returned to Jersey. En route back to our point of origin, the cabin crew told passengers that we'd be 'looked after' by Blue Islands on our return to Jersey and that taxis and overnight accommodation would be provided by the airline. However, when we returned to Jersey Airport, there was not a single Blue Islands employee to be found. The Swissport employee who rebooked the passengers said that provision of taxis and hotels was (understandably) not a Swissport obligation, and this meant that Blue Islands had not only failed to provide the taxis and accommodation promised, but didn't even have the courtesy to send an employee to inform us of the same. We were abandoned at the airport and left to fend for ourselves. When I made a complaint, various Blue Islands' staff denied that we had been abandoned at the airport because Swissport had rebooked us and that Swissport were 'representing' Blue Islands. Being rebooked and then left in the airport without the taxis and accommodation promised, and then being left to fend for ourselves doesn't equal abandonment in the world of Blue Islands. I did wonder what I would have done if I didn't have the money for a hotel or the means to get there. I couldn't tell if anyone from Blue Islands could have cared less as they didn't even have the courage to find an employee to 'front up' to a very angry group of 20 passengers who had been lied to then abandoned. You can't actually rate this level of 'customer service' because there wasn't any. That Blue Islands couldn't land in Southampton due to fog is not their fault. To return the passengers to Jersey and then just leave us in the airport is absolutely unforgivable though. I can honestly say that in c.40 years of flying worldwide I've never experienced anything like this. As you can probably guess, some two months after the event I remain disgusted with the way the passengers on this flight were treated. Blue Islands told me that the cabin crew shouldn't have promised taxis and accommodation. Maybe so, but it didn't stop them from doing so - repeatedly - and when you make that commitment, you are obliged to follow it through if you want to be taken seriously as a company that has any interest in the concept of customer service. Blue Islands didn't follow through, they just ran away. This behaviour was shameless and exacerbated by Blue Islands showing absolutely no contrition whatsoever and claiming that being rebooked by Swissport somehow did not equal abandonment by BI - not only a nonsensical argument, but an offensive one. An absolute joke of an 'airline'. If they had any competition on the routes they fly then they'd be out of business in a fortnight if their behaviour on the night in question was the norm. Shocking. Offensive, uncaring and ignorant. Avoid.

### "we left about seven hours late"
❎ Unverified |  I hate to say this, but my opinion of Blue Islands has really changed after my flight to Southampton. It started by the airport announcing that my 7am flight was delayed to 9.40am due to a late inbound aircraft. Once 9.40 came around, we were informed that the flight was delayed until 10.50am, due to 'bad weather' (there was light mist but lots of other aircraft were arriving in fine). Soon after that, we were informed that Blue Islands had no idea when our plane was going to arrive, and told to wait until 10.30 for new information. The 'new information' was infact just that the new information would be coming at 11.30am. And then 'next info at 12.30', and then 'next info at 13.00'. Absolutely no Blue Islands or Flybe staff around in the terminal. Then, our plane lands, but the delay still keeps on being pushed back. In total, we left about seven hours late. On the way back we were delayed about half an hour, which isn't too bad. The aircraft we were on were clearly very old and tired. There were some loose pieces of metal on the cabin walls, and the seats had small damage, and overall the cabin was fairly discoloured and dirty. Cabin Crew were very friendly however. I usually am fine with Blue Islands and have no problems with the Flybe franchise, however the service was awful. I would try and avoid Blue Islands in the future.

### "sold its soul to the devil"
❎ Unverified |  Guernsey to Southampton. Such a huge disappointment that what used to be a great little Channel Island based airline has now merged with FlyBe. A route that was already relatively expensive, for the air miles travelled, has now become excessive due to the unreasonable way that FlyBe charge for absolutely every aspect of your booking, including booking seats (how else do they propose we travel in an aeroplane?) and taking luggage. This has greatly increased the ticket prices (on a recent review of tickets for later in 2017, I found this to have worked out at approximately £100 increase, roughly a third increase! ), which I think is disgraceful. What used to be a small, customer focused company appears to have sold its soul to the devil and been swallowed up by the greedy big boys and I will have to think twice about who we fly with in future: such a shame as I always chose Blue Islands previously, for so many positive reasons.

### "had to drop to Flybe standards"
Southampton to Guernsey. Really disappointing now that they are incorporated to Flybe. Previously flew this route often with Blue Islands, always good service and on time. Now, impossible to book with free baggage, prices increased, less staff at Southampton and bundled in with other rest of Flybe flights so long check in queues. I understand that airlines need to adapt and move with the times, but why Blue Islands have had to drop to Flybe standards I don't know. Onboard service ok, but expensive/ poor selection food and drink. Would rather have the old lounges and tiny planes back! Would recommend flying Aurigny from London or Bristol instead!

### "flight was not operating"
I booked flights for my boss and 2 colleagues with Blue Islands to fly to Jersey on Tuesday 23/5/16 on a flight due to depart at 14.40. I booked the flights online on 27/4/16 and checked them in online on 22/5/16. When they arrived at London City on Tuesday they were told by airport staff that Blue Islands have changed to their summer schedule and that the 14.40 flight does not operate any longer. Not only was I able to book the flights less than a month ago, I was also able to check them in online and print boarding passes for a flight that was not operating. We received no message whatsoever that the schedule had changed and in fact they are still selling this flight on their website. I've had no response to date to any of my emails or voicemail messages left with their 'Customer Care' department. My colleagues also informed me that there is no Blue Islands desk in London City Airport.

### "expect much better customer service"
Absolutely appalling. Blue Islands changed my booking less than 24 hours before the flight from Bristol to Jersey by 3 hours on the way out 4 hours on my return journey. They didn't have the courtesy to call me to ensure that I received this important message, and did not apologise in their email and neither have they apologised subsequently, despite writing a complaint. The actual flight was very loud, but apart from that is adequate. But with such high prices you would expect much better customer service and it appears as this is completely lacking.

### "very unhelpful offers"
Saturday afternoon phone call to say Monday's Blue Islands flight (23rd May) from London City to Jersey was cancelled. No emails, no messages, lucky I picked up the phone call. Very unhelpful offers of other flights far too early or far too late. Shambolic, trip ruined, what a rubbish airline.

### "I could not check in online"
Blue Islands Airline has a poor Website and I could not check in online. No problem with British Airways, EasyJet or Flybe. Phoned up Blue Island Customer services. Dreadful customer service, just left waiting on hold. Only one carrier between Jersey and Guernsey, so much for competition. The customer services representative told me to queue up at the airport for a boarding pass.

### "would fly with them again"
Jersey to Guernsey. When I was looking for flights to Guernsey, I originally chose Flybe, but the return trip was cancelled so I was forced to go Blue Islands. The staff at check in were very friendly and efficient and the lounge was fantastic with free coffee and biscuits. ATR42-320 cabin was lovely with comfortable seats and flight was on time. The only thing I didn't like was the price. It was a 10-15 minute flight, but the fare was £60 per person per way! And they charge £29 per person per way to get from Jersey to London! I would fly with them again.

### "company in grave and terminal distress"
My Blue Islands Southampton to Guernsey flight was cancelled due to fog last Sunday which was bad weather luck. I emailed Blue Island that evening to cancel my Monday return flight and to ask for a refund. I also tried phoning but gave up after 20 minutes in the queue. Today is Wednesday and I am in Guernsey Airport. They have not yet replied to my email. When I go to their website they state that I am unable to 'manage my booking' for that cancelled flight, and there is no refund option on the page. I have tried phoning Blue Island again today several times, and after a 10 minute wait I left my phone number for a call back. None so far. It makes no difference which dialling menu option I choose, I get the same braying idiot recorded message telling me I'm in a queue. Actually I think the recorded message would be more truthful if it told me that there's no one there to answer my call. Now, I would have thought I could find a Blue Islands employee at Guernsey airport but there isn't one. Their customer service desk is manned by Aurigny who are able only to give me the same phone number and email address for Blue Islands. There is a courtesy phone, but this only reaches the same braying idiot. My experience has many of the characteristics of finding a company in grave and terminal distress.

### "very poor service"
Blue Islands provide Ryanair quality for British Airways prices. They didn't load our checked bag onto the plane because they'd sold too many seats. Absolutely no information until we arrived in Jersey to our surprise. Very poor service getting our bags back - if we did not chase, we would not have heard anything. I would never voluntarily fly with them again.

### "Avoid at all costs"
A truly horrible experience. I was visiting from Australia in August 2015 and spent one night on Guernsey visiting an old friend. My outward journey had been with Flybe and was pleasant and uneventful; sadly, my return journey was with Blue Islands. Both flights had been booked online through Opodo on 20 April 2015 - 4 months before the trip. On the afternoon of my departure, my friend took me to the airport in plenty of time for my 16.15 flight back to Southampton. I checked in and was given my Boarding Pass. A little later than scheduled, we were called to board our flight and all left the Departure Lounge. We stood for half an hour with no information about why we weren't boarding the plane. Eventually somebody came and told us that "the technical fault is much worse than we thought". As this was the first we had heard about a technical fault, we were somewhat surprised. Another 40 minutes later, three of the passengers were called to the desk, myself being one of them. We were informed that the plane couldn’t fly, that the replacement plane was smaller and therefore three of us were being thrown off the flight with no promise of when we would be put on another flight. We all had boarding passes in our hands. I asked how they had chosen which passengers to evict and was told that we had been the last three to check in. I asked whether we had all checked in within the required time period and the staff confirmed that yes, we had indeed checked in within that time. When I asked to speak to a Duty Manager I was told that all Blue Islands staff in Guernsey had been made redundant and so there was no staff member available to speak to. I finally boarded a flight at 9.15 that night, got back to Southampton at 10. The person who had been going to meet me at 5.00 could not come at that time so I then paid 30 pounds for a taxi to Portsmouth as it was late and I was a 60 year old woman alone and did not want to start looking for trains. And in the 5 hours than I spent hanging around after my scheduled departure, they did not supply me with so much as a bottle of water. That night I had been going to have dinner with my niece who was leaving the UK early the next morning. Obviously I didn’t see her. I hadn’t seen her for two years and have no idea when I next will. Avoid at all costs.

### Blue Islands customer review
SI257 2 June 2015. Dreadful. Now that they have a near monopoly on the Southampton - Guernsey route they are putting fares higher and higher and cancelling where pax levels are low. The mid afternoon flight from Southampton to Guernsey seems to suffer a high degree of last minute "operational reason" problems. Today told cancelled due to fog. Rubbish. Guernsey has poor weather but above legal limits for flying. I phoned customer services who were not bothered and said the aircraft were running late and hence combined the flights. Funny how a company takes advantage as soon as they have a controlling market share!

### Blue Islands customer review
The flight to Jersey was on time and the flight crew were lovely (went out on the 8.30am flight). It was a unique experience to be on a 19 seater plane and to be able to watch the crew in the cockpit (my 2 rating is for the flight crew). The plane was noisy and a bit dated but we could put up with it for the 40 mins flight. On arrival we were met by a Blue islands representative who told us they couldn't put 7 lots of luggage onto the plane as the plane would have been overloaded! We were given assurances that our luggage would be with us on the next flight. It got to 7.30 pm and our luggage still hadn't arrived and after many many unhelpful phone calls to Blue islands we were told the luggage was with a courier but they couldn't get hold of him and had no idea where he was. The luggage eventually arrived at 7.50pm. We were some of the lucky ones as others had to wait until the next day. Luggage being left behind seems to be a regular occurrence.

### Blue Islands customer review
Have just flown Blue Islands from Southampton to Guernsey and return on an ATR 72 the flight was find slight delay leaving Southampton but no worries there at Guernsey the is a lounge dedicated to all Blue Islands passengers with free drinks and snacks which is a nice touch. I enjoyed the flight and the experience with them.

### Blue Islands customer review
Jersey to Southampton was OK but the return non trip five days later was a nightmare. Arrived at airport to find flight cancelled having received no prior warning. Spent an hour waiting to be transferred to Fly BE' s flight on the following morning. No Blue Islands representative at Southampton airport to advise what the problem was but heard from several people that this happens quite often with their Jetstream aircraft. Will never fly Blue Islands again.

### Blue Islands customer review
Blue Islands flights from Cambridge to St Helier Jersey. These flights operate on Saturdays only during the summer months and are so convenient for East Anglian holiday makers. The flight of 50 minutes was comfortable and efficient in the ATR 42. The ease of travel made us feel we had slipped back 3 decades to a time when air travel was much more pleasurable. On board there were complimentary non alcoholic drinks. There was a modest and welcoming lounge with complimentary drinks and biscuits on our departure from Jersey airport.

### Blue Islands customer review
Guernsey to Paris return via Jersey last weekend. Outbound flights and connections went well with great cabin service including champagne lager tea coffee and good quality rolls and snacks. Return flight was disappointing. An elderly aircraft really showing its age. In fact the seats in the row in front of us were a completely different style to the rest! The air conditioning didn't work which was unfortunate on such a hot day particularly as we had to sit in the plane on the tarmac at Paris for around 25 mins. Some of the no-smoking signs didn't illuminate - not a problem but reinforced the impression of a rather shabby plane. Very cheerful cabin crew. Arrived in Jersey for our connecting flight to Guernsey only to be told it had been cancelled - it was a bank holiday Monday and apparently they never operate that flight on bank holidays and we should never have been able to book it through their website! So what should have been a one hour connection at Jersey turned into 2.5 hours. Again not a huge problem but for an airline that pitches itself as something above the norm it was a bit disappointing. Fares were good value and flight times to and from Paris were convenient (aside from the delay on the return).

### Blue Islands customer review
BRS-JER-BRS. On time out and a delay of 45 minutes on the way back due to bad weather earlier in the day making the in-bound aircraft late. We were kept informed of progress with the delayed flight. Lounge at Jersey is a welcome change with free soft drinks coffee/tea and biscuits. The service on-board was good too. This was efficient and professional.

### Blue Islands customer review
We flew Southampton to Jersey and return where Blue Island use 19 seat aircraft. Both flights has less than ten passengers and were on time even early. Avoid row one unless you want an excellent view of what the pilots are doing as the view outside is restricted as no windows forward of this row. The best view was from row six and with such small aircraft the views are excellent. As with all small aircraft the noise level is higher than for a large aircraft but for such a short flight it does not matter. The private lounge at Jersey was a nice way to end a short holiday. We will certainly be flying Blue Island again.

### Blue Islands customer review
Southampton to Guernsey return great price and no additional charges. Good luggage allowance. Flight left on time good service - very impressed. Have looked at other routes that we could use Blue Islands for in the future.

### Blue Islands customer review
I flew yesterday to and fro from Jersey to Guernsey. I was extremely impressed with the lounge reception and all is facilities. I am slightly disabled and the Stewardess was very helpful and attentive on both my journeys. Plenty of leg room on the plane and good and comfortable flight. I will certainly use them again when I can.

### Blue Islands customer review
Staff kept us informed of any changes or delays to our flight fog was a problem and the flight was over an hour late in leaving Jersey but staff were great. I will travel them again and have no problems recommending it to others.

### Blue Islands customer review
JER-GCI-JER-LCY. Inter-island flights on a little Jetstream. Only 10 mins each way but good fun. With the open cabin and no door to the flight deck it really gave an insight into what the flight crew do. Far from trans-continental business class that I often fly but in many ways this was a lot more enjoyable. The lounges for all passengers are a nice touch but some air con in Jersey would be good. Timetable seems to not be completely thought through for connections (eg 1hr 30 wait in Jersey for flight to LCY). Would like to see a GCI-LCY direct flight added or better connections to the JER-LCY flight so that a LCY-GCI trip can be done in a day. All in all though a very good experience that I would happily repeat.

### Blue Islands customer review
LCY-JER-LCY in ATR-42s each way. This airline tries hard but falls short in some areas. Online check-in did not work at the advertised time (48 hours). I called customer services and the rather indifferent phone operator casually told me it was always like that. Secondly passengers should be aware of their unusual baggage allowance. The checked plus carry-on can total 20 kg. Nevertheless carry-on weight was not checked at either LCY or JER. We arrived at City Airport and couldn't find the bag-drop desk - told to use the Luxair desk. Aircraft itself was showing its age and could do with a deep clean but was comfortable. One member of cabin crew for 50 passengers and each way they were cheerful and pleasant. On the outbound morning flight a croissant with butter and jam was offered with non-alcoholic drinks. On the return evening flight there was a full bar service (even champagne) but no snacks. Blue Islands passengers can use their dedicated lounge at JER. However its based at gate 7 which is at the far end of the airport and not air conditioned. Drinks biscuits and wi-fi were good. Overall a good airline but should certainly bring their London operations more into line with their competitors.

### Blue Islands customer review
I travel inter island JSY-GSY return twice a week. Blue Islands have made the classic mistake of forgetting their core business model. Their inter island flights are now so often delayed that a tannoy announcement that there is "a delay due to technical reasons" is now met with resigned scepticism. They have also made the mistake of outsourcing their ground crew ops to Serviceair who neither know nor care why the flight is delayed by 40 minutes [again]. Planes in the main are uncomfortable and claustrophobic groundcrew are ill informed and inter island timetable is more akin to an unscheduled series of aviation "events".

### Blue Islands customer review
Outbound (from Southampton) was very good: easy check-in we liked the Jetstream experience and the cheery professionalism of the flight crew but Jersey-Southampton was a nightmare. Firstly 13.25 flight cancelled for 'technical' reasons. When offered a refund or rebooking we accepted seats on a later flight. This was a very stupid move because the 4 hour delay turned into a 7 hr 50 mins delay. If warned our Jetstream was bound to be the last flight out of the island at 20.15 we could have used the 7 hr 50 mins delay to catch a fast ferry. Given zero customer care and a total lack of honesty there is no way I would risk another flight with Blue Islands despite the professional flight crew the convenience of their new London City route and certainly not because of their pricing policy.

### Blue Islands customer review
Check-in staff more than helpful at Manchester airport arrived early glad we paid for the lounge to wait - supplied very good choice of food/drinks. Good assistance onboard. Staff at Jersey airport very informed and directed us to the lounge. I must say the staff on return plane so good helping me to get down steps very nice people and will certainly travel them again.

### Blue Islands customer review
SOU-JER return. As my 2008 review Blue Islands has standards that other airlines would do well to emulate: clear and inclusive pricing flexibility easy check-in punctual lounges for the use of all passengers (at least on the Channel Islands). You are treated as a person it is good-fun travelling not a comment one can make often these days.

### Blue Islands customer review
Southampton to Jersey. The baggage system at Southampton was faulty and my bag did not make the flight. The staff at Jersey were excellent (Jersey airport Blue Islands and Servisair). They kept me informed and my suitcase arrived at my house at 8.30pm. A big thank you to all concerned.

### Blue Islands customer review
We tried to make a return reservation from Jersey-Zurich. The return schedule was not available so the Blue Islands staff person on the phone advised us to book the outbound and the return separately when the schedule was available. This we did. Because we booked the return from Zurich as a separate flight on the advice of Blue Islands staff we have been charged the return fare in Swiss Francs. The difference is approximately L200. We have written and faxed Blue Islands but they do not reply.

### Blue Islands customer review
Blue Islands really do make the customer feel special and not like cattle herded onto a plane. Staff are most courteous and booking online is quick and simple with no hidden charges. Give me Blue Islands airways any day of the week. Just a pity Blue Islands don't fly to Bournemouth from Jersey anymore - but you can't have everything.

### Blue Islands customer review
I have just completed a round trip from Jersey to Geneva Christmas 2009. My journey both ways was very enjoyable. As someone who has no choice of airline to get out of France (Dinard) to the UK I have to use Ryanair the difference was startling ! Ryanair is not cheap if one has luggage so it's not the price I'm comparing it's the service. To have all the extras in the ticket price makes for a very relaxed way to travel. I loved it and can't recommend highly enough.

### Blue Islands customer review
We used Blue Islands for the first time a few days ago and certainly will be using again. Not only were the fares considerably cheaper than other airlines the complete package from booking online to arriving at Jersey and return to Southampton was so professional. The cabin crew on both flights were first class nothing was too much trouble for them their attitude and appearence gave a confident and professional air.

### Blue Islands customer review
SOU/JER via GCI. Booked BI rather than FlyBe after reading good reviews. Outbound was professional and genuinely like flying used to be. Dornier comfortable and quiet - cold drink plus snacks SOU/GCI cockpit visit on ground on GCI made our son's day almost instant baggage retrieval at JER and all at £150 less than FlyBe for the round trip. Return on a Sunday evening full JER/GCI - JER lounge cramped (2 flights to GCI) but free refreshments welcome nonetheless. Slight delay on incoming and high load on GCI/JER return led to switch to ATR42 for GCI/SOU. All handled efficiently and with smiles all round. 5 minutes late into SOU on Sunday evening - baggage off in 5 minutes so very pleased all round.

### Blue Islands customer review
I have been impressed with the three Blue Islands flights I have been on in the last couple of years from Guernsey to Alderney and twice to Jersey. The lounge service in Guernsey is excellent and all the staff very friendly and professional. My passport which I accidentally left on the plane this week following a flight to Jersey this week was retrieved quickly and given back to me in the arrivals hall which I was very pleased about!

### Blue Islands customer review
SOU-GCI-SOU. Flybe appeared a better deal at first glance but once I had a proper look and added up the extras (since when was baggage considered an 'extra'?) it didn't look so good. I was also irritated that they were trying to mislead me about the total cost of their flights. So I booked Blue Islands and very glad I did. They're using the Dornier 328 on this route now and it's more comfortable than I'd expected for this size of plane (a 31 seater). They managed a cold drinks service in the just over 30 minute flight (and we arrived early both ways.) The lounge at GCI is excellent - lots of choice of hot and cold drinks and biscuits. All in all it was a more personal better quality of service than I'm used to for a very reasonable and very clear price. I'd certainly recommend them.

### Blue Islands customer review
GCI-SOU. Very good value. Everything included in the headline price no "extras". Nice little lounge at Guernsey for free drinks and biscuits. Dornier 328 very comfortable aircraft.

### Blue Islands customer review
JER-GVA-JER. Booked online - easy and reassuring. Slight problem in that unable to check in online due to technical issues. Lounge flight service all fine - long way home due to (scheduled) stop over in Zurich. Complimentary drinks and snacks and boiled sweets a nice touch. Living on Jersey our choice of airlines and routes is limited. We are all fed up with Flybe and so it is great to have another professional airline to choose from.

### Blue Islands customer review
Southampton to Guernsey return - usually made on FlyBe but we wanted to change having been increasingly unimpressed by FlyBe's use of additional charges which make their "bargain" fares poorer value. Blue Islands' price was all inclusive comparable in total costs and offered a really impressive service in the face of adverse weather conditions. We were due to depart early on a fog-bound April Friday morning with a ferry connection we had to meet by 4.15pm at the latest. First flight was cancelled due to fog but second noon flight was swiftly re- arranged luggage transferred all with minimal fuss and still within the desired time window. We arrived in time to lunch on Guernsey and made our connection - wonderful service unlike that of their larger competitor which cancelled a similarly timed early morning flight and were unable/unwilling to "rescue" friends in time to make the same ferry. We had a fabulous weekend on Herm - they eventually arrived on Saturday missing half their break. Our return flight left early and arrived early with equally impressive service including the excellent Blue Island lounge at Guernsey. We have already booked our next flight with them and will seek to use Blue Islands whenever possible in future.

### Blue Islands customer review
Bournemouth to Alderney and back. I cannot praise them highly enough. Obviously customer care is easier when you only have seven people on a plane but it was the little touches like giving us earplugs because of the propeller noise that are nice. All staff on the ground and in the air were friendly and helpful and courteous. Blue Islands will also allow you to change your booking at no extra cost should you need to. Also I had originally booked to fly from Southampton but they stopped flying that route. So they refunded me in full and gave me free flights on an alternative route. Other airlines please take note.

### Blue Islands customer review
JER to GCI and GCI to SOU on Jetstream 31. A terrific experience! This is how airlines should be. Having flown earlier in the day with Flybe Blue Islands was a breath of fresh air! The complimentary lounges at both Jersey and Guernsey were fantastic and the onboard crew were a top draw. A service with a real personal touch in future I will always be using Blue Islands where possible.

### Blue Islands customer review
GCI TO SOU. It became evident job would not be finished until later that evening. Phoned Blue Islands mid afternoon and changed flight to Sat am. No problem no charge and cheaper than the competition (Flybe). Straight orward fares no extra for bags no paying to check in. Fully flexible up to 1 hour before.

### Blue Islands customer review
JER-GCI-JER. What a great service! A user friendly website which is not full of tricks and gimmicks to cost you money and all fares fully flexible change as often as you like without any fee. Online check in up to 48 hours in advance a little cumbersome but it works and a small lounge at the airport for all passengers with drinks and biscuits. I don't really think one can expect more on a 10 minute flight. Friendly and relaxed staff but obviously professional and rather like flying in the old days in light aircraft. A lot of fun.

### Blue Islands customer review
I like small aeroplanes therefore the Blue Islands' Jetstream 32 Southampton-Guernsey (return) was terrific. From a customer's point of view it was excellent: on time both ways use of lounges flexible tickets as standard nothing to complain about really. The real experience is going an aircraft where the first officer is the cabin crew the cockpit door is open and everyone gets a big window to look out of; it is all very informal and good fun - just like flying used to be. I admit I would not want to take a very long flight in a Jetstream they are quite noisy but for this sort of journey it was perfect. Blue Islands treat you as a person not a piece of self-loading freight.

### Blue Islands customer review
IOM to GCI. Guernsey now lacks a true business service since the disappearance of BA. Flybe economy plus product is expensive and offers little and Aurigny have no business product. I liked very much Blue islands the time keeping and friendly approach of the pilot’s and lounge staff at Jersey. The service certainly has a unique brand feel and a unique business model flying small planes with no hostess at flexible business type fares offering complimentary lounges in the channes islands However the shortcomings are that the J31 is not a particularly comfortable for Journeys of over an hour and while I welcome the lounges at JER and GCI there is no lounge access anywhere else. (Incidentally JEA used to have a hostess on their twin otters whan flying STN- GCI)). Suggested improvements would be offering a carry on refreshment bag or even the co pilot organising drinks from a thermos!
