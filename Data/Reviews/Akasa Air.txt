### "trouble boarding the flight"
Not Verified | Staff is worst and speaking non sense. Flight is delayed by 2 hours and he was asking us to make two 7 kg hand bags instead of only one 9 kg hand bag. He had made sure that we should have trouble boarding the flight and knowing we have a kid with us. Seriously very bad behavior. They should train their employees to behave.

### "way they handle passengers luggage"
I am not satisfied with the way they handle passengers luggage. It was very frustrating when received my luggage bag at Mumbai airport with big cracks in it, so here we buy expensive and strong bags just to make sure our things in it remains safe and due to this irresponsible baggage handling policy we have to think twice before we buy such expensive bags again.

### "I do not recommend Akasa Air"
I recently traveled with Akasa Air from Bengaluru to Abu Dhabi as part of my Etihad Airways booking. This was one of the worst airline experiences I have ever had due to poorly trained staff, unprofessional behavior, and unfair baggage policies. Harassment at Check-in Over Name Format At the Bengaluru airport, I was held up for 45 minutes because my middle name was part of my last name in my passport (which is a common format in Indian passports). This same name format was used in my UK visa and all my documents, yet Akasa staff acted as if my passport was incorrect and interrogated me unnecessarily. They completely lacked basic knowledge of name formats and international travel documents. I had 2 kg excess baggage, and instead of allowing me to remove or adjust my items, they forced me to pay ₹11,000! This was completely unreasonable and felt like a scam. The ground staff was arrogant, unhelpful, and had no sense of customer service. Instead of assisting passengers, they were rude and dismissive. The way they handled my check-in added unnecessary stress to my journey. If you are flying with Etihad Airways, avoid routes that involve Akasa Air—it will completely ruin your travel experience. I do not recommend Akasa Air to anyone who values professionalism, fairness, and stress-free travel.

### "warmth and professionalism"
From the moment I boarded, the crew exuded warmth and professionalism. Junu and Reeza provided assistance wherever needed. The in-flight service was impeccable. Bhoomi and Nisha managed the meal service efficiently. The crew went above and beyond to ensure passenger comfort. Whether it was providing extra blankets, assisting with luggage, or attending to special requests, they were attentive and proactive. Their kindness and willingness to help truly stood out. Looking forward to flying with Akasa Air again!

### “Good Airline to fly with”
Not Verified | Good Airline to fly with. Good staff, and services, there were no delays in departure and arrival. The luggage at the belt came very fast. Only the problem was: Seat was not comfortable.

### "staff was very rude"
Akasa Air staff was very rude, I had worn warm clothes during my on going journey as February is winter, my return flight was afternoon I had put warm clothes in cabin bag & had food water with me & they asked me to place purse along with cabin bag & weight was one kg more, I requested to consider but they never did I took away food & had to throw they were ok with it & charged me 600/- for 1kg. Staff is very rude and not cooperative.

### “Akasa helped us”
We were running late due to high traffic in Ayodhya owing to Kumbh Mela 2025. Akasa helped us by providing 10 buffer minutes at boarding. This helped us in arriving to the flight in time. They have ensured that our boarding is faster so that overall flight time wont get delayed. As soon as we are seated, flight took off within 10 mins. This did not result in any delay.

### “Really appreciated the efforts!”
Not Verified | We were running late due to heavy unpredicted traffic in Ayodhya. It was a surprise to see even the airport route was blocked. We drive to airport and called Akasa Airlines and they helped us to wait for few min. Many thanks to ground staff where they waited for us and helped us to get in faster, Akasa accommodated my request and waited for me for boarding. Really appreciated the efforts!

### "still money isn't refunded"
I have Bad experience with Akasa Air with their staffs including emails team and customer care. I tried to book tickets on 19th December 2024 (total 6 family members) however several attempts transaction was failed finally 2nd last transaction payment was successful but tickets not booked and I saw on the screen money will get refund within 5 to 7 days however now more than 14 days and still money isn't refunded. Even I send email 5th times with transaction screenshot and bank statement, after 45 hrs they responded and requested again payment screenshot however bank statement was attached in the 1st emails even I shared again now almost 60 hrs and didn't get back any responses after calling customer care they said I have to wait how long they don't have any answers.

### "unprofessional ground staff"
Not Verified |  Extremely rude and unprofessional ground staff. I had a horrible first time flying experience with Akasa. I was travelling with my friend and our PNR's were different as we had booked the tickets based on the offer we got. Our check in luggages were 20 KG and 7 KG respectively and we had to make changes and then both our bags were below 15 KG then staff just to trouble me further started asking all sorts of questions like am I carrying any breakables? She made me sign a declaration and took my phone number, asked how many hand luggages I had? I never had to face this harassment with regards to our checkin luggages and was never asked these weird questions.

### "disappointment and frustration"
Not Verified | I am writing to express my disappointment and frustration with the service I experienced on my recent flight QP-1125 from CCU to BOM on 26/11/2024. My PNR number is L5GYGP. I was scheduled to fly from CCU at 21:35 and arrive at BOM at 00:30. However, I received an SMS notification that the flight was delayed by 35 minutes. When I informed the Akasa Air staff about my connecting international flight ET 611 from Mumbai T2 to Lilongwe at 04:05, they assured me that I would have sufficient time. Unfortunately, I received another SMS notification that the flight was delayed by 2 hours. Despite my concerns, the staff reassured me that someone would assist me in Mumbai. I arrived at Mumbai airport around 2:30 AM and waited for my luggage until 3:15 AM. By the time I reached T2, the check-in counter had closed, and I missed my connecting flight. Ethiopian Airlines was unable to accommodate me on the flight. I hold Akasa Air responsible for the missed connection and the resulting inconvenience. As a result, I will be advising my friends, colleagues, and relatives to avoid traveling with Akasa Air.

### “extremely helpful and patient”
As a senior citizen I was facing boarding issues but Ms. Sneha at the Boarding counter was extremely helpful and patiently heard me and resolved my problem. This is the first time I have come across such a staff eager to help everyone with a smiling face. All my blessings to her for her future.

### “very rude and difficult”
Worst experience with ground staff at the counter. They have been very rude and difficult to deal with. I wish I had never flown Akasa Air. Worst staff in airline industry.

### "Egoistic staff everywhere"
Not Verified |  I didn't know they are going to be so cheap in cooperative with 1-2kgs of extra luggage. They kept asking 1200 rs, that female staff was unreasonable. In the flight, I asked I want to use loo, the female attendant told wait sometime, didn't bother to ask again, I kept looking for them then pressed the button. Thirdly, when they told they would take cash for meal, they were not even asking every seat row if someone needs to order something or if someone needs a cup of water (don't know if they even had free cup of water or not?). Egoistic staff everywhere is what I faced and courtesy to ask back for anything.

### “rude and difficult to deal with”
Worst experience with ground staff at the counter. They have been very rude and difficult to deal with. I wish I had never flown Akasa Air. The flight departure was also late and there is no information neither by messages or phone call. Worst staff in airline industry.

### “lacked any customer service skills”
Not Verified |  Never book a flight with this airline, especially if you need to travel with your pet. I booked a flight and sent them a confirmation email for my cat, but they informed me that I made a mistake by booking it before getting the confirmation. They said they didn't have a slot available for my pet on that day. I agreed to reschedule on a day when a pet slot was available, but then they realized that the photo of the pet carrier I provided wouldn't work because I had given them an Amazon description and a screenshot of the bag link. I had ordered the bag but it hadn't been delivered yet. They asked me to wait until the bag was delivered so that I could measure it with my hand and a measuring tape and send them a picture. They claimed that the dimensions mentioned in the description might be different from the actual dimensions of the bag. Despite all the inconvenience, I agreed to wait for my bag to be delivered. Now, when I asked them to reschedule my ticket for the day when a pet slot is available, they asked for an extra 12k for rescheduling. This means that in addition to the approximately 11k I already paid for my previous ticket, I have to pay an additional 12k for rescheduling and 7500 for my cat. So, instead of the original ticket price of 11k, they are charging me a total of 30k including the cost for my pet. I also want to mention the rude behavior of all the agents. They spoke to me like robots and lacked any customer service skills.

### "delivered a broken suitcase"
They delivered a broken suitcase, which was checked in. The ground staff not so much helpful and made me wait long hours On top that, they refused to provide a claiming form or go ahead with the refund claiming process

### "rude at the check-in counter"
Absolutely the worst experience! This is my second time flying with this airline, and both times they’ve managed to mess something up. The staff lacks basic courtesy and has no idea how to communicate with passengers. The ground staff have a condescending attitude. Last time, while traveling from Bangalore to Mumbai, the flight was delayed by 3 hours, and they didn’t even bother informing passengers. This time, while traveling from Mopa International to Bangalore, the team was incredibly rude at the check-in counter.

### "Highly unreliable airline"
Highly unreliable airline. Cancelled flight last minute and they called before 4 hrs to say it is cancelled. Extremely disappointed with this airlines.

### "Absolutely third class airline"
Totally unreliable, unapologetic airline. They share an one liner email at 1 AM in the morning informing flight cancellations for a morning flight scheduled on that day. No other communication, no alternate flight arrangements. When called up their customer care, these shameless guys informs we have another flight next day, but you have to pay the balance, wow. Absolutely third class airline, avoid as much as possible.

### “extremely disappointing and unprofessional”
Not Verified | Delayed by 2.20 hours. Slow airline and slow staff. Always delayed and worst staff and behaviour. Highly cheap way of operating and extremely disappointing and unprofessional.

### "worst aircraft service ever"
Not Verified |  The worst aircraft service ever. Starting from ticket counter, all the staff member were really rude with us. The flight was initially cancelled by Akasa’s side and then they arranged an alternate flight which was again delayed by 4hrs. Highly recommend to spend some extra bucks but go with any other airlines but not Akasa.

### "Very disappointed"
Not Verified | I was supposed to fly at 10:50 AM today, but flight rescheduled to 3:30 PM, and I only received the message at 6:00 AM. We planned our entire day, and now it's all wasted—hotel, cab expenses, and our entire itinerary ruined. When we asked for rescheduling early or compensation, team refused and only offered cancellation. When I have reached the airport flight again delayed by 25 minutes. Very disappointed

### "reported 5 mins late"
Not Verified |  I and my family reported 5 mins late to Akasa Air Counter in Bangalore Airport. The staff were not ready to consider my request for check in, no refund no alternate flights! Very unfriendly staff, no courtesy to talk with worried passenger, ultimately i lost the money and flight. I will not advise any body to take AKASA AIR, greatest fear of mine come true.

### "Careless Customer Service"
Not Verified | It took more than 2 hours to get the boarding pass from their Mumbai T2 counter. In between, when I reached out the available on ground staff/leads, they all have one very careless answer, this is not my responsibility. I have never face such type of careless service from any domestic or international. Even the municipality buses are now giving far better service than Akasa Air. Please go through all reviews, tweeter posts before choosing Akasa Air. When I tried to reach their customer service, I found they are the biggest idiots, simply copy & paste same recorded message. My honest feedback for Akasa Air is 1. Careless Customer Service 2. Unprofessional Ground Staffs 3. Untrained Social Media team 4. Worst Customer Service

### "Awful service and food"
Not Verified |  Awful service and food that is impossible to eat, employees unwilling to give water throughout a 7-8 hour trip. Overall, the service was the most terrible experience I have ever had. Didn't want to rate them even with one star.

### “a horrible experience”
It was a horrible experience as a first timer with Akasa Air. I am frequent flyer and opted AKASA AIR SERVICES for the very first time. I reached for check in at 15.10 and the Flight time was 15.55. They still had 45 minutes in their hands but no clue why they closed the gates before time at 14.55 which is not done at all. Such a ruckus for all, 10 passengers were standing in the check in counter and the staff had closed the gates before the time. While asking for penalty charges they were asking us for the whole amount of the ticket to pay again. This is really harassing the customers.

### "utterly disgusted with the service"
Not Verified | I’m utterly disgusted with the service provided by Akasa Air. My recent experience with them has been nothing short of a nightmare. After they inexplicably canceled my flight, I was left scrambling to find an alternative. To my horror, I discovered that rebooking would cost me double the original amount. This is beyond unacceptable! The lack of communication and the blatant disregard for customer satisfaction is astounding. Not only did they cancel my flight without providing a satisfactory explanation, but they also took advantage of the situation by gouging me with exorbitant rebooking fees. It’s clear that customer service is not a priority for this airline. If you value your time, money, and sanity, steer clear of Akasa Air. Their incompetence and exploitative practices have left me with a bitter taste and a significantly lighter wallet. I will never fly with them again and strongly advise others to do the same.

### Akasa Air customer review
My grandfather traveled from Delhi to Mumbai in Akasa Air and he loved the experience. He is a frequent flier and requires wheelchair assistance but the hospitality of Akasa Airline was better than Indigo Airline and air hostesses were also nice, friendly and helpful.

### "Worst experience"
Not Verified |   Worst experience and flight delayed by 8hrs. And robotics experience with staff with repeated answer and no proper solution. Even the flight was old one.

### "advise against choosing Akasa Air"
Not Verified |   My recent experiences with Akasa Air have been disappointing and frustrating. Despite traveling with Akasa Air six times, I have consistently faced flight delays without valid explanations, causing inconvenience and stress. The lack of refreshments or compensation during these delays only added to the dissatisfaction. Additionally, the significantly higher prices compared to other Indian airlines make it hard to justify the cost given the poor service and lack of customer satisfaction. I strongly advise against choosing Akasa Air for travel.

### Akasa Air customer review
Almost 90% of time the flights get delayed up to 4-5 hrs. And the customer care and the staff never agrees to provide any refund and not ready to reschedule the flight. And if they agree for rescheduling, the next flight will be always 1-2 days later from the original date of booking. Pathetic operator unprofessional

### "had a fantastic flight"
We had a fantastic flight, it arrived early to my destination. The counter guy named Fahd was very friendly and service oriented,  I was was very impressed with his service quality and approach.

### “I’m a happy customer”
Thanks Gaurav and team, it was a memorable one! Great job all! From Goa to Delhi 27th June, 2024, Flight number QP 1358. It was a delayed flight, still I’m a happy customer.

### "Great fare and greetings"
Thank you so much for your service however the experience this time was not up to the mark. I called the order for two times but the cabin crew keep on saying that they are serving the pre booked meals. I mean come on guys 4 cabin crew serving pre booked food. Now this is fine but the order was given by me when we airborne and the seat belt signs were off but order to me came at 2100 hours and I have to wait for 10 mins as crew mentioned me to keep the noodles soaked for few mins. As I ordered chilli Manchurian noodles and cappuccino (which was served later due to seat belt sign on). Once I started my meals, landing was announced and cabin crew started insisting me to close the forward tray which I also understand as per security and safety reasons. But please understand I can't hold coffee and noodles in my hand and eat. I think one of the cabin crew can take care of it rather 2 cabin crew were assisting me. Nandini and Anil were great. Great fare and greetings.

### "received a seamless experience"
I was about to miss my flight. I was stuck in traffic on my way to Pune Airport. But then I received a call from Vaishnavi  an Akasa Air executive. Vaishnavi with the help of Steven, Rinki and Sakshi ensured that I received a seamless experience from the checkin to the boarding gate. They assisted me at every step and had even held the flight for few minutes. I’ll forever be grateful to the Akasa Air staff who helped me and assisted me in that state of panic and rush. Thanks a lot again.

### "happy with his service"
Not Verified |   I was traveling from BNG-PNQ today moring i.e., 08th June 2024 and have mistakenly left my phone in the cab. I realized it when I boarded the flight, the air hostess were kind enough to help and called the security on ground. Mr Mahesh Supervisor, BLR, tracked the taxi, coordinated with the people involved and got me back my phone before the flight takes-off. I'm very impressed by his eagerness and an pro active attitude to help me going out of the way. He has been so kind, humble, polite and calm through out the rushing process and ensured I get the phone. Absolutely happy with his service and he truly deserves a great salute and amazing words of appreciation for his customer service.

### "very polite and helpful"
Miss Kajol was very good in hospitality and makes us very satisfied in check-in process. She was very polite and helpful for making my entire team very happy.

### "the worst experience ever"
It was the worst experience ever. I was traveling with my kid. My flight got cancelled without any notification and new flight details were not shared along with the timings got changed without notification and above all no one was informing me the correct details also the gate number provided was wrong and no update for the correct gate number. Very bad chaotic situation. I was mentally harassed during the time of check-in process. They troubled me in their best possible way. They have asked me to weigh the water bottle I am carrying and many other things to trouble me. Never ever recommend anyone to travel with Akasa air. I will never ever travel with this airline, pathetic staff, no knowledge of anything.

### "never tell you have to pay extra"
When you book a ticket they never tell you have to pay extra. For digi Yatra you need boarding pass. When you try to do webcheck-in. They ask you extra charges. My point is if that is the case please tell before hand. People can plan their travel and cost accordingly. This is mere nonsense and unprofessional way of handling.

### “All of us got seats in different rows”
Not Verified | We were 6 people including a child and senior citizen travelling from Mumbai to Bengaluru. We received our Boarding pass six hours before the departure time with the seat number and other details. When the boarding started our boarding pass did not get scanned successfully, reason being the seats assigned were changed. All of us got seats in different rows and there was no communication until the boarding time. The crew asked us to check with other passengers to exchange the seats as we had child with us. We had a valid boarding pass sent by Akasa Air with the assigned seat number and at the last moment they changed our seat without even notification. This was really a bad experience and I would never opt for Akasa Air ever.

### "customer service is hopeless"
Not Verified |   Hopeless service they are not refunding my money from last 12 days, consistently I am following up but they just say one thing that it is under process but the money never comes. I tried booking the flight front their app but the ticket was not confirmed and the Money was debited from my account. I gave them all the details they asked and they even verified it but did not return my money. Their customer service is hopeless and people are reluctant, they do not care about their customers and they treat you like garbage .I have been requesting them to return my money but they have no answers or timeline to when exactly. I am so disappointed by this Airline and so exhausted

### "a great experience"
It was a great experience. We lost one of our bags on the airport and the airport staff was very helpful. They helped us get our bag back in no time. Special thanks to Nelofar for making our experience good.

### "Great airport staff"
Not Verified |   Had a comfortable flight last night. Great airport staff, nice hospitality. Special thanks to Arpita and Shivaji they have helped me a lot at the check in.

### "Excellent airline"
Not Verified |   Excellent airline. I flew with my pet and everything was smooth. Very helpful ground staff and crews. Tasty food. On time flight. This will be my go get flight from now

### "Waste of money and time"
Worst experience. No value of time. Always flight are delayed and simple word by Airline staff for inconvenience is just saying sorry. Not professional & time bound. Waste of money and time.

### "Ridiculous customer service"
Ridiculous customer service. I was charged extra luggage for ~1 kg extra luggage. The lady at the service counter suggested to try and travel other airlines as well for service comparison. I'm really going to refrain myself from booking this airline again.

### "Extremely satisfied"
Extremely satisfied with Akasa Air service. They provide timely updates, cabin crew is helpful and what I appreciate is they have a crew with gender neutral dressing and the members speaking multiple languages. Several options in food.

### “no consideration for passengers”
Worst airline, no consideration for passengers. Flight aborted half way on run way after waiting in plane for 1 hr, took it back to terminal for re-fuelling, passengers remained in plane for more than 3 hrs and no any snacks offered. Refused people to deplane and re-boarding.

### "Horrible service"
Horrible service. First they change in timing not once but twice, then change in the gat thrice, then change in seat no. as the airplane changed. Then after so much, the flight delayed with not so helpful staff.

### "Very polite ground staff"
Not Verified |   Very polite ground staff as well as crew. I and my husband were travelling together but we were assigned different seats. The executive at check in counter Mr. Babloo was very cooperative and assigned us seats together. I’ve not experienced this with other airlines.

### "Consistently delayed"
Consistently delayed. Ground staff makes it sound like it’s very common although in my experience all other airlines either inform in advance or are on time These people waste your time and this is not my experience alone for the first time. It’s every single flight that I have taken with Akasa whether it’s me my husband or my friends.

### "the worst airline"
Akasa Air is the worst airline. I tried to get my bag scanned at 1:00 PM in Gauwhati, but they said I had to wait 40 minutes. I asked the team to do it early, and one of them started arguing with me. A total of five members are available, but none of them are ready to scan.

### "I will never recommend"
My luggage was mishandled and they have broken a wheel of my trolley. Upon raising complaint, no staff was ready to hear my complaint and asked me to leave as they cant do anything. My experience to deal with this situation was very bad and I will never recommend or fly via Akasa air.

### "will charge for arriving 10-15mins late"
Thought I was the only one with this experience but after reading similar reviews here, it seems like it is their scheme to extract money from the passengers. They close their counters early, disallowing the passengers to check in their bags. Staff at Akasa Pune just state their “terms and conditions” to explain their inability to help in any way. Offered to accommodate us on the next flight but charged a “penalty” which costs almost the same as the flight ticket. Overall money minded staff who do not bother to accommodate the passengers at all and will charge for arriving 10-15mins late

### "late by 25 minutes"
The flight was at 4 30. We reached check in counter at around 3.40 pm and the lady at counter said you are late by 25 minutes. They can reschedule flight by paying penalty of rs 4k for 2 persons. These people are not at all customer friendly.

### "never book Akasa Air again"
Not Verified |  My main Luggage was 1.9 kilos more and I had zero hand Luggage and asked in the check in counter politely to give me exemption as am travelling first time with Akasa. I also told her I don’t have any bag and she was laughing sarcastically. I will never book Akasa Air again.

### "experienced great service"
Not Verified | i flew with Akasa Air in December and experienced great service like comfortable and nice legroom seats, crew was friendly and came around the cabin 6 times, wifi was bad, value for money excellent, check-in was slow, no food, no entertainment. Will defiantly fly with them again!

### "a very bad airline"
Akasa Air is a very bad airline which in my experience they can't help their customers. They ignore, they talk rudely, and only care about money. Please don't travel with them. If you are traveling after seeing this feedback you will feel regret. Big zero "0" review from my side.

### "nothing short of a nightmare"
Not Verified |  I recently had the misfortune of flying with Akasa Air, and my experience with their customer service regarding a rescheduled flight was nothing short of a nightmare, I had a morning flight for convenience, only to receive an email notifying me of a rescheduling to a night-time departure. First and foremost, lack of communication from the airline was appalling. I was informed of the change just days before my original departure, leaving me with minimal time to adjust my plans. The airline failed to provide any reasonable explanation for the abrupt change, leaving me frustrated and inconvenienced. The rescheduling flight time itself is highly inconvenient, as i originally chosen a morning departure to suit my schedule. Furthermore the airline exhibited a complete lack of empathy towards passengers affected by the rescheduling. There was no compensation offered, not even token gesture to acknowledge the inconvenience caused. It's evident that customer satisfaction is not a priority for Akasa Air. I strongly advise anyone considering this airline to think twice and explore more reliable and customer oriented options.

### "utter nonsense ground-staff"
An utter nonsense ground-staff, completely unprofessional. She did not have the courtesy to admit her mistake - initially all of us (passengers) had already formed the line, then she announces that the boarding will be done Zone wise. Also, she made an announcement that the line should be formed where she is standing. We all mentioned to her that we are already in the line here, why don't you continue here. She said, since I had not made the announcement, how can you even form a line. A 2 minutes later, she announces that form a single line and she will allow everyone inside. When I asked her, you were supposed to let us in by Zone wise, to this she mentioned, but I also announced that it will be line wise.

### "Strongly recommended"
Very polite & pleasant staff both ground & in flight. Special mention for Mr Bikram from the check in counter. He was extremely courteous & very accomodative. Boarding commenced on time & flight landed half hour before schedule. In spite of turbulence, flight was quite smooth. Kudos to the Captain. Very good experience flying Akasa for the first time. Strongly recommended.

### “Efficient and user oriented airline”
Efficient and user oriented airline. Check-in counters are very well managed. Staff is well behaved and takes care of requests of passengers. I was personally pleased to travel by this airline. My sincere complements for Mr Satya Prakash who was manning the check-in counter at Delhi airport T-2 terminal at around 0900 hrs on 01 Mar 24.

### “incompetence, stress, and utter unprofessionalism”
I had an utterly dreadful experience with Akasa Airlines during my recent attempt to fly from Ahmedabad to Delhi. It was nothing short of a nightmare filled with incompetence, stress, and utter unprofessionalism. Upon arriving at the airport, I was shocked to discover that I had somehow missed my flight despite being present well within the recommended time frame. To my disbelief, it turned out that Akasa Airlines had initiated boarding earlier than scheduled, without bothering to make any announcements or inform passengers like myself. The lack of communication and disregard for passenger convenience exhibited by Akasa Airlines is simply unacceptable. Despite my timely arrival at the gate, I was met with closed doors and indifferent staff who callously informed me that boarding had concluded. This experience left me feeling frustrated, inconvenienced, and utterly disillusioned with Akasa Airlines. The airline's blatant disregard for basic customer service standards and its cavalier attitude toward passenger satisfaction are indicative of a company that prioritizes efficiency over the well-being of its customers. In conclusion, I strongly advise against entrusting your travel plans to Akasa Airlines. Save yourself the hassle, stress, and disappointment by seeking alternative options that prioritize professionalism and customer care.

### "Excellent Value for money"
Smooth check in, lovely staff and new airplanes. Great uniforms. Clear information and No delays Pilot communication good. Excellent Value for money.

### “can't provide customers with basic facilities”
Not Verified | I traveled in Akasa Air flight no QP1607 to Delhi. Before the take off I asked three cabin crew members for water. One said she'll bring it. Second didn't answer. Third said he'll provide the same after take off. Even after take off they didn't provide me any water. I reminded them the same while they were serving on which they said wait for them to come to my seat. These people can't even provide their customers a glass of water. My throat was hurting for 1 hour after take off and these people were refusing to provide water. Some of the cabin crew members names are as follows- Flight Attendant Nikhil and Flight Attendant Sanchari. I don't recommend this air company for people in the future. These people are rude and can't provide customers with even the basic facilities.

### "don’t value people’s time"
Please don’t fly with them ever if you want to reach somewhere on time. They have the worst flights and don’t value people’s time whatsoever

### “this is not the way to talk”
I am a frequent flyer - Mumbai Bangalore Mumbai. My flight QP1738. At the checking counter I told the lady issuing the boarding pass that the luggage conveyer is very dirty. Her immediate reply was "your bags are dirty". I was taken aback by her answer I showed her that my bag is not dirty, and may be some one was walking on the conveyer with shoes on. She again told me your dirty bags is what causes the conveyer to get dirty. I told her, in that case it should be cleaned. Her reply was you tell Adani to clean it. The lady sitting in the next counter also started telling me that it is not their problem. I was not rude or impolite. I saw that the main conveyer was clean, I told her that if it is problem with our bags how come the main conveyer is clean. The other staff again started her mouthful and I told her to keep quiet as I was not talking to her. The lady again told me to contact Adani. I told her that I am at airport as I had booked a flight with Akasa and not Adani. I asked me go away. I want to bring this incident to the management's notice. Maybe they had a bad day. But this is not the way to talk.

### "Worst experience with Akasa Air"
Worst experience with Akasa Air. I booked tickets in December 13th, 2023 from Bangalore to Guwahati. We reached at Bangalore airport at 4.20pm and the flight is at 5.10pm. I understand we were running late but there were still 50 minutes of time. We went to drop luggage, the lady mentioned that it's too late. We requested her to take our luggage but she refused to take it. Instead she asked us with no mercy to book another tickets or reschedule the tickets. That was the day I understood this airline they don't value passengers. The way that the lady behave and instructed us instead of taking our luggage, I felt like they scam passengers to get their money. They don't even care or think how much money the passenger  had spent on the tickets. We were three of us and 1 tickets cost us almost 9k each. Be careful when you travel with this airline especially when you running even little late for the boarding, these people will not even care to connect with their team at the gate to check and inform of the same. I have seen many other airline they inform and check with team accordingly. Never I will recommend this airline even if there's no flight as per my flexibility. I rather cancel my trip/journey.

### "pleased by the service"
Extremely pleased by the service of Ashna and Sajit. Very friendly and polite. The best staff I have so far come across in Indian domestic flight. They are professional to international level

### “We had the worst experience”
Not Verified | We had the worst experience flying with Akasa Air, it was delayed for more than 3 hours without any information regarding the delay. Vistara is the best, I would never recommend Akasa.

### "approached me in a very rude manner"
On 4th February 2024, my family and I were traveling from Mumbai to Bagdogra on Akasa Air flight QP1385. Initially, the experience seemed promising, and I was excited to try Akasa. The pre-ordered meals were good, but as the journey progressed, I encountered an issue with one of their cabin crew members. While I had my 3-year-old child sleeping on my lap, I placed an unopened meal box on the seat next to me. Cabin crew approached me in a very rude manner, questioning why the box was there and insisting that I remove it. This interaction left me unsettled.

### “delayed flight without any prior notice”
Not Verified | Such a pathetic service Akasa air offers. First of all they delayed the flight without any prior notice. We got to know about delay after reaching the airport. Secondly, the checkin crew & cabin crew are way too rude. The founder Mr. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala was a humble personality & its important for the staff to stay grounded always like him or else all their flights will be grounded soon. Cabin crew earning peanuts in salary but showing attitude as if they own the airlines. Never recommending anyone to fly via Akasa air. No matter the prices. Vistara is the best.

### "Experience is not good"
Not Verified |  Experience is not good. Staff shortage is there. Flight is delayed and there is no fix time of boarding, and no one is there to inform us time.

### "polite interaction with the passengers"
I traveled from Mumbai to Varanasi on QP 1491 on 21st January 2024. This was my first experience of flying with Akasha and I am impressed by the behavior of crew and their polite interaction with the passengers. Although my flight was delayed by an hour, it was not Akasa's fault. The rates for Akasa Cafe edibles were genuine and the taste was amazing.

### "By far the worst experience"
Poor communication and management. Extremely unreliable and misbehaved staff. Our flight was from Ahmedabad to Mumbai scheduled for 11:50am, despite reaching the airport at 9:45am, 2 hours prior to the departure we were told the gate was closed. On further inquiry we were told that the flight was preponed to 10am No intimation or message or email was provided about the same. The on ground staff was rude and told us to figure things out ourselves and they would neither book us on another flight nor would them refund the money. We have lost out on a business day of work and an additional 30K to re-book flights out of our own wallet. I would discourage anyone from flying this airline that does not consider hospitality or care towards its passengers a priority. By far the worst experience I have had flying

### "experience was disappointing"
The airline was delayed by 2 hrs. It happened for both the ways. To and fro. Since they have limited aircrafts, they use the same one for multiple segments. Hence delay in one flight can lead to another. There was no prior announcement on the delay, which only leaves most passengers irate. My flight was delayed close to 2.5 hrs when my overall journey was 1hr 20 mins. I reached home in the middle of the night which ruined my next day. Overall the experience was disappointing and I would never prefer to take this airline again.

### "No value for money, poor service"
Not Verified |  First of all the flight was delayed 6 hours and rhe customer support were absolutely of no help. Even after the delay and boarding, they kept delaying the process and made the passengers wait for 45-50 more minutes. The cabin crew were underwhelming and absolutely no service was provided as a compensation for our time. Many of us had connecting flights which had to either be cancelled or postponed. No value for money, poor service. Never Again.

### “disappointed with the cabin crew service”
We were fine with the flight but were highly disappointed with the cabin crew service. We paid extra to get an upgrade to premium economy sits and when the café service started, we understand that PRE orders are taken as priority considering the flight times but our fist row my mom and aunt were in the 3rd row were completely ignored. No one bothered to even ask if we wanted to order anything, the service just went to the 2nd row for the PRE order and then to the economy class. So we’re for some free baggage and asking the crew at last for a cup of noodles and a coffee they had such an unpleasant expression on their face. We have been flying with different operators and also Akasa for many years now, multiple times a year but haven’t been treated so ignored and unnoticed.

### "Thank you very much"
Would like to appreciate Akasa air Mr Naveen who was very helpful in the last moment as we left power bank in the baggage and was stuck. The power bank was not trashed and he helped us to get it back to the boarding point. Thank you very much Mr Naveen it is very much appreciated

### "got a bad experience"
I was travelling from Kolkata to Bangalore with my parents carrying eleven liquor bottles. But they didn't allow me to carry that many bottles and said that I can carry 8 litres. I told them we are three passengers, and I have three more bags to keep the other bottles. They were not ready to do it. I was coming from Kolkata to Bangalore in an Indigo flight, carrying the same bags, I didn't face this issue there. I am aware that passengers can carry upto 5 Liters of alcoholic beverages as part of their checked-in baggage. I got a bad experience from Akasa Air yesterday (9-1-24).

### “Non helpful staff”
Non helpful staff. Very terrible experience. They did not send me a boarding pass even after I did web checkin. When I reached to the counter for the boarding they made me go there twice because they said go to the gate directly they will take you in. I returned from security check in and then they said sorry now you are late. I was still ready to take the flight which they said wait for the reserved lounge and till that time was assured that they will put me in their next flight which was around 21:35 and still after waiting a good number of minutes they said we are full. Now I am staring at IndiGo and booking theirs at 8 times higher rates.

### “I was very disappointed”
I had travelled first time with Akasa Air and I was very disappointed. I ordered for Poha which was priced Rs. 200/- for one bowl. The bowl size was big but Poha quantity was very less. It's about 1/3rd of the total quantity. It was so ridiculous and terrible. Paying high price and get very less food quantity. Overall, I would never fly again with Akasa Air.

### "do not consider Akasa Air"
Not Verified |  The worst decision to have travelled with Akasa air. The flight scheduled to fly at 8:30 am flew at 2 pm from Delhi to Mumbai. They shared it was due to bad weather, however, indigo, the same aircrafts as Akasa were flying with very minimal to no delays. On arrival, we had to sit in the craft as their parking spot was “busy” due to VIP movement. Even if you get a free ticket to fly, do not consider Akasa Air.

### "Worst overall experience"
Worst overall experience. Change in time has not been shared via any mode of communication. Staff are rude and they haven't let us in despite the flight didn't start on time. Overall worst experience. Money wasted and never recommended anyone to take this airways.

### "Bad overall experience"
Not Verified |  Bad overall experience. Do not recommend. Got my flight rescheduled information just shared on email. Web checkin has no option to check seats, due to which I got seat that I hate in spite of making early check in. Delayed. First and last experience.

### "unreliable company"
Most foolish and unreliable company. Either they are 4 hours prior or 4 hours late without any update. Web check in even they don’t send to the all passengers. 80% people were fed up every time I can see at the airport.

### "Frustratingly bad experience"
Frustratingly bad experience to travel with pet I had booked a flexi ticket + airbnb for a holiday in Goa. My cat weight is ~7.2kg and I kept 13th as deadline for weight to come under permissible. On 13th I call and share that weight is coming to be 7.2kg and inquire if its ok or I should cancel. The executive swiftly says go ahead make the payment, I will make book an exception for you. I was like wow and foolishly made the payment. Now on 17th, I called to check if fit to fly certificate (to be submitted within 72hrs) is Ok and the executives mention that your pet is not booked properly, also no exception is mentioned. I am constantly on call for 7 hours since 1pm and still they are just giving lame answers to wait. The staff is lousy and I feel no one responsible works there. I have made peace that I have lost all my airline + airbnb money.

### “ground staff were immensely helpful”
Not Verified | I was traveling with my infant alone from CCU to BOM and running late. The ground staff were immensely helpful and helped me like my family. Without their cordial support I may not able to board the flight. I had to leave my luggage behind due to security clearance which they send back on the next available flight. I must mention about Ms. Veronica who has helped me a lot, starting from carrying my laptop bag and hold my baby during security check. I would say, one of the best customer experience I have with them that time. Thank you Veronica (kolkata)

### " worst flight I have experienced"
Not Verified |   It is the worst flight I have experienced. It is delayed 5 times. Even after reaching airport it got delayed 2 times (5 hours) . No prior information was given. Staff was not providing the proper reason of being delayed so many times.

### "make life easier for pet owners"
I travelled first time on 11 & 19 Nov from Goa-Delhi and back. The airline Permits small dogs/ cats in baskets up to 07 kgs all inclusive weight which was a respite from AI. The airlines promotes pet policy but does not cater for it digitally during my return flight also. All medical certificates with vaccination and pet cage were sent to the airline 72 hours in advance but at the airport it was harassment as the person on duty had no clue of pet carriage policy. The various forms to be signed were not available. During Security, the CISF wanted cat to wear a muzzle which does not exists. Whole lot of harassment for various things which had already been shown to the Akasa staff. In the Air, the  Hostess wanted the cat basket to go under the seat which caused a lot of anxiety to the pet and the cat was uncomfortable as there is hardly any space between the seats. All this made our air journey with my small cat a horrible nightmare in spite of paying Rs 10000 for my cat ticket. I request you to kindly consider the followings to make life easier for pet owners. Small dogs/cats with containers weight upto 07 kgs should be permitted inside the cabin with the pet owners. The small pets should be allowed with the cage to travel in the lap of the owner. The pet should be shifted under the seat during take off / landings. Airline staff including CISF should be conversant with the latest regulations of pet carrying policy so as not to harass the pet owners at the time of travel. The pet vaccination, fitness certificate, pet cage which has already been verified/ checked should be conveyed to the next airport if there is a return flight in the same airlines.

### "did not allow me to board"
Not Verified |   Service with zero empathy. After being late by 9 mins (arriving at 6:44 for a flight starting at 07:35), the team in Bangalore did not allow me to board the flight. The policies are not customer-centric and reward only the owner.

### “Foolish Airline”
They don't even clean the flight before departure, the area below my seat was so dirty that one cannot even travel like that. Foolish Airline. Will not travel in future.

### "a horrible experience"
Not Verified | It was a horrible experience. They charged 5000 rs for a two year old child who cannot even sit on a seat separately. This is preposterous. The ground staff is rude and uncooperative

### "No customer support and understanding"
Extremely worst experience. No customer support and understanding. Akasa only wants money and does not want to serve their customers. Akasa do not even value their customer. Other airlines allow customers to check in even 5 minutes before departure. Akasa did not allow us 45 minutes before and charged extra for the next flight. You can check the airport cctv. We were called by gate number 28 but the luggage woman did not allow us to go and she wasted 15 minutes and said now you are late and you can not board. Such a nightmare. Extremely disappointed. Date: 15/11/2023, Time: 14:30, (BOM to LKO). I know according to airline policy the passenger is supposed to arrive at least 120 minutes before. But sometimes the airline should understand the circumstances and if a passenger gets late it does not mean that the airline will reject the ticket and waste the full money. I did web-check-in 15 days before when I booked the ticket. For some reason I was late by just 15 minutes so I was expecting that the airline would allow me to board the flight. This was unexpected by Akasa. Even the language executive wasted 15 minutes. You should value your customer and customer's money.

### "it leaves a very low impression"
My meal plan for my return flight stated 2 Platter but yet I was given just a box of mixed nuts. Can someone kindly explain what went wrong and where. I think the crew of all persons should know best the meaning of platter. I have flown this airline for the very 1st time and if I was given the wrong meal it leaves a very low impression. I would appreciate if someone could get back to me with an explanation.

### "a very nice experience"
Not Verified |  It was a very nice experience with Akasa Air, QP1369, 10Nov2023. and I really appreciate the staff. Very thankful and special thanks to the well groomed and well behaved staff! Special thanks to: Ms. Raveena. She have done very helpful and well efforts and very kind and very polite. It was wonderful flight and great inflight service.

### "Unprofessional throughout"
Not Verified |  Apathetic staff. Hidden charges. Unprofessional throughout. Airline has hidden add ons on booking. Check in window on third party app closed 2 hours before. On reaching the airport 1 hour before the flight we were denied entry. No will to help a customer. On asking for a solution we were told only the immediate next flight will be available. Not any other on the same day. On talking to a duty manager he manually gave the permission to staff to book us another flight. If it is so manual with no written or online process then what’s the issue with helping us board the same flight when we were well within time. Other flights like Indigo or SpiceJet will make that effort to help the customer as long as the flight is not getting delayed or caused any trouble with passengers. There’s a reminder email, phone call and message that you will receive in case you are running late. There’s none present with Akasa. It’s not an airline, a bus service is more customer friendly than these folks. Do not choose Akasa for your economy travel. It won’t be the cheapest as it shows since you have to compulsorily add on a seat and if you by chance reach airport later than 1 eta to the flight then you will be made to miss it.

### “chose Akasa because they fly pets”
I chose Akasa because they fly pets. We had 2 cats travelling with us, one in cabin and one in cargo hold. The experience of flying my cats on Akasa was far less stressful than with Air India. Riya, Sharanjit, Akhil, Akash, Prasoon and Hari Om were very helpful and stayed with us throughout the entire process from checking to scanning my cat for cargo hold to scanning my pet for travel in the cabin. My cat in cargo hold was removed promptly after landing and brought into the airport, where he was waiting when we collected our priority marked baggage. I would definitely fly Akasa again for my cats. The one improvement is the website information and phone and email communication regarding flying with pets, prior to traveling. It can be simplified and clarity can definitely be improved.

### "Loved the hospitality of staff"
Not Verified |  Great flight, very comfortable seats. Loved the hospitality of staff from the check in till the cabin crew in the flight. Exceptional hospitality and help by Riya Singh at the check in counter at Delhi airport. Early morning when you come across such wonderful people when you are just starting your trip, you know for sure, you are going to have a great trip. Special thanks to Riya Singh again.

### "Very bad service"
Not Verified |  Do not travel with this airline. Very bad service and they reschedule the flights left and right. I booked the flight at 6:40 am and Im reaching just 2 minute late and they are say we are closed, this flight boarding and I book next flight from Mumbai. When Im in waiting area and see scene that flight is late 20-30 minutes. Won't be traveling with this airline ever again.

### “excellent service”
I traveled me and my friends in Akasa Air on 27th from Mumbai to Bengaluru, flight number QP1341. On this flight Swetha and Sofia both were giving excellent service to all passengers, both were good and intelligent. Very thankful to both.

### "Extremely bitter experience"
Since I was living in USA visiting India in October 2023 my brother booked my ticket for me in august. I land on the day of travel and was told that flight was cancelled. There were no text or email notifications (I had my brother recheck all messages and emails). Interestingly I prepaid for excess baggage a day before travel and the website accepted the money and gave a fresh ticket. How in the world can a cancelled flight accept excess baggage????? I had to board my intl flight from Hyderabad so I requested them to get me on a Partner airline so I can make to Hyderabad on time. They were open to putting me on a flight that took me to Mumbai and then to Hyderabad 2 hours before my intl flight takes off and the counter personnel were alleging that it’s enough time to take my bags from the carousel, go to the intl terminal, do immigration and security, all in 2 hours. Eventually I had to book from a different airline that cost me triple the amount. Extremely bitter experience and terrible customer and counter support. No empathy at all. In all, in my opinion a terrible airline, terrible IT systems with no safety nets in place and horrible customer support.

### "Service was very good"
Excellent ground and in flight staff. Helped me with super senior father, helping me load my cabin luggage too. Service was very good. Special thanks to Jatin, in flight staff, who helped me with my father. After exiting the airport, I realised I had left a baggage near the conveyor belt. The CISF jawan posted near arrival 11, lady at Akada Air counter, Akasa Air staff inside Ashwanth and Kanhu who was helping with my father's wheelchair left no stone unturned to help me get it back, taking all precaution to verify it's authenticity. Kudos to you and thank you.

### "don’t consider this airline"
One of the worst experience I had in Akasa air. I have selected for the seat 19A,19B,19C in online later and I have paid for the seats. Later on when I  reached to airport they allotted the seat as per there conveniences one is 12D the next one is 12E the other seats is 19C this is the type of cheating will happen there we are went in a family trip we all three are seating in three different positions. Please don’t consider this airline.

### "experience was very bad"
As per plan Bangalore landing time 7.34 pm but landed 8.21pm, take off time plan 6.15pm but started 6.57pm. Time management very poor. Total experience was very bad

### “In-flight service is pathetic”
Worst airline I have ever flown. Lousy check in service. In-flight service is pathetic. Ordered food on flight and it turned out to be half cooked and when I tried to highlight this the crew member got into argument. I'm sure it won't run for very long. They don't have the class to run an airline company.

### "a very nice experience"
It was a very nice experience with Akasa Air, QP1125, 6 Oct 2023 and I really appreciate the staff. Staff were really well behaved and very helpful so that made me write about this experience. Very thankful and special thanks to the well groomed and well behaved staff! Special thanks to: Drushti, L Nitin, B Rohini, J Akshay.

### !Very bad service"
Not Verified |  Do not travel with this airline. Very bad service and they reschedule the flights left and right. I booked the flight at 7pm in the evening but it was rescheduled to 9pm and they boarded the passengers in the flight and later informing flight won't operate and we have to come again from the security check. Won't be traveling with this airline ever again.

### "they misguided me"
Unwelcoming Staff and no manners at all. Their crew needs to be disciplined as they’re rude. And resolution of issues I’d rate them 0. My laptop bag was drenched in water inside the overhead cabin while I had no water bottle in my bag. Upon talking to the crew, they asked me to go to the arrivals at the airport which was just a lie to get me out of the aircraft, little did I know that it they misguided me, I wouldn’t have left the aircraft without having someone taking responsibility of the damage it caused to my laptop and charger.

### "not trained in hospitality"
Akasa Air ground staff Mumbai and Goa are rude, unprofessional and not trained in hospitality. My bags were put on a later flight than I was booked and I had to wait 3 hours for it. Mumbai ground staff assured me my bags would be on the same flight but that did not happen. I made a written complaint when I got back and was assured someone from the airline would get in touch with me within 24 hours but, that did not happen either ... its 3 days.

### "so welcoming with small kids"
Not Verified |  The flight took off on time, and landed before 20min of expected arrival time. I was surprised by the way cabin crew behaved with passenger, very well mannered, they made it sure that all are well seated. They were so welcoming with small kids.

### "the worst airline ever"
This is the worst airline ever. Every time I have travelled with Akasa Air the flight is delayed , this time the flight is delayed by 2 hours and there is no proper communication of the same as well.

### "Worst experience"
Worst experience. I had booked ticket for my daughter. The original timing of the flight was around 12:35 pm, about 15 days before travel, it got moved to 9:10 pm and on the day of the travel, it got moved twice to 10:35 pm. This is highly inconvenient as I had selected the original time due to its comfortable timing given a female passenger is travelling.

### "the worst airline in India"
This is the worst airline in India. For just 1 kg they took 500 rs. There was unorganised staff at the counter hence such a serpentine line was there. The baggage to be carried with passenger was taken to be check in just before boarding. And only few people were detained. Some just slipped by unfairly. Food was not good. Everything was very unorganised.

### "flight schedule is highly unreliable"
Experience-1: This was my first experience with Akasa Air, where I had booked a ticket from Bengaluru to Mumbai on 9-Sep, 2023. The original schedule of the flight was from 11.45 to 13.30, which was very convenient to catch my connecting flight to Diu at 15.55 from Mumbai. Before a week of the journey, I received an email for the flight reschedule, where the new schedule was from 12.35 to 14.20. When I checked with the airline that this new schedule would cause an inconvenience for my next connecting flight, they simply stated that the schedule change is less than 2hrs and nothing can be done and no refund shall be entertained upon cancellation. I had to cancel my tickets so that it does not cause any trouble to take my next connecting flight. Experience-2: I had booked tickets with Akasa Air from Bengaluru to Mumbai for 21-Oct, 2023, where the original flight schedule was from 4.45 to 6.25. Again I had to go through the same plight. The flight got rescheduled and the new timing was from 6.15 to 7.45. This time my connecting flight from Mumbai was for an international travel. I had a couple of calls with the customer care stating that I have 8 tickets booked with them and this new schedule will cause an inconvenience for my connecting flight. As always, they just kept repeating that such cases cannot be taken care by their policy and if I had to change my flight, I had to pay extra charges (which was close to Rs.10000 for all the 8 tickets). I felt this was unfair because they also had a new flight on schedule from 4.50 to 6.50 and they could have provided a shift for a nominal fee (considering 8 passengers). Conclusion: I had two consecutive bad experiences of flight reschedule with Akasa Air. So, if you have connecting flights in your journey avoid booking with Akasa Air because their flight schedule is highly unreliable, especially if you are tight on schedule.

### "Akasa helpline number is useless"
The Akasa helpline number is useless, no one picks up emails are not answered. I had minor name change and I was helpless as there is no way to contact the airline in case of cancellation. The flights are also always late.

### "I missed the flight"
This is very unfortunate that I missed the flight. There is gate change, no announcement at the airport, no display on gate board. I was sitting just aside the gate, not had idea when it leave. Checked in 3 hour earlier.

### "no sign of the refund money"
Not Verified |  We had booked 3 tickets for the sector Kochi Bangalore almost 2 months ago for travelling on 1st September 2023. On 22nd Aug, we received a mail saying that this particular flight has been cancelled with no other details. Then we tried to contact the customer care number provided on the email. After trying for almost 15 times in 2 days, we finally got through this number and spoke one of the officers. He over phone cancelled our tickets and told me that the entire money would be refunded within 7 to 10 days. Now it is almost 17 days and there is no sign of the refund money. He also said as per the airline rules, we will also get the excess amount we had to pay for booking another airline for the same sector on the same day. We booked on Indigo and sent all the details to nodal officer email id provided by this officer. He promised, this would also take 7 to 10 days. We haven't received even a single penny so far despite sending several reminders to "nodal" & info mail ids.

### "happy and friendly crew"
This was my first time with Akasa Air and it was refreshing to see the happy and friendly crew. I would specially thank the Supervisor Rahul. He glanced at me once and he immediately understood that I was at discomfort in my allotted seat. He quickly made changes and ensured that I was at comfort. Never experienced such attitude in any other airline I have flown.

### "very unprofessional support agents"
Not Verified | Very very bad website. It does not even work on some browsers. Never ever reschedule. They have the worst user experience and you will not even understand the difference amount that you need to pay. Worst customer support. They have no clue or idea how their website works and all things are done offline. Very very unprofessional support agents. They have no empathy for the customers

### "reschedule flight multiple times"
Please don't go with Akasa Air. They reschedule flight multiple times. And they force you to pay extra for seat selection. While rescheduling you will find your previous seat get cancelled and some other person already booked. Now you have to select other seat and pay. Akasa Air do this frequently.

### "will not fly Akasa Air again"
Not Verified |  Akasa Air are Masters in Re-scheduling/Cancelling: We booked a return flight from Bangalore to Goa and back. 1 Day before Akasa Air sent a message that they have rescheduled the return flight which was 2 days after ongoing journey. Re-scheduled time slot was not suitable for me and Immediately I called customer care. Believe me, for 2 days, called almost 8 to 10 times a day, I could not get hold of Customer care number. I went to airport on the day of onward journey and inquired in the Akasa Air counter to get me a alternate flight, but no use. No one will help you. You will hear bunch of sorries, but your problem will not be resolved. They take their passengers for granted. I will not fly Akasa Air again.

### "This journey was a nightmare"
Not Verified |  I booked my Lucknow - Ahmedabad flight with Akasa - QP 1525, LKO to AMD for 14 Aug 2023. The flight was scheduled to depart at 9 pm. I booked this flight according to an extremely important and unavoidable official engagement, which was to get over at 6 pm, and it was safe for me to catch my flight at 9 pm. This was booked in June. I got an email on 21st July 23, that my flight was preponed, and I was booked in QP 1625 with DEP: 17.05, ARR: 21.15 on 14th Aug 23. I was put on an indirect flight via Mumbai, doubling the travel time. However, the most critical issue was that my official assignment was unavoidable and my leaving early had serious consequences. I tried contacting the customer care number mentioned in the email more than 50 times from the time I received the mail. The customer care phone never got connected and answered. I booked my flight through MakeMyTrip. Even the MakeMyTrip agent could not connect to Akasa Air for an update and neither were they informed about the flight preponement. I wrote and email to the airline and DGCA. Even this was unanswered. Ultimately, there was no option, and I had to take the preponed flight at 17.05 pm incurring an extremely serious and irreparable loss to my assignment in Lucknow. This was only the beginning of the ordeal. After reaching Mumbai, I, along with 5 other passengers who were to go to Ahmedabad, were also asked to deboard the plane (which was to go straight to Ahmedabad). We were told we would be boarded in another flight to Ahmedabad at 19.30 pm. An Akasa Air attendant - Mr Altaf (The only good thing that Akasa Air has is Mr Altaf) took us to the security gate. Our boarding passes mentioned in indirect flight from Lucknow - Mumbai -Ahmedabad were rejected, and we were not allowed to pass through the security to gate 31. Mr Altaf tried his best to get new boarding passes, but the server was down. Out of 5, only one got a printed ticket and others got stamped handwritten tickets, we had to go though security check-in twice and at each gate the tickets were not getting accepted. Our flights were missed again. After loosing the 7.30 pm flight, we lost 8.30 pm flight. We managed to reach the security gate for 9.30 pm flight. Now, we found that this was also postponed and the flight was postponed to 10.30 pm. A transit bus full of passengers were already seating outside the security for parking flight for 2.5 hours and there was a ruckus and shouting. Customer care was unreachable all this while and it was inhumanly pathetic. Passengers were handed out food box of manchurian rice (without spoon) and water. There was not response from the Akasa Air authorities all this while. Finally the flight to Ahmedabad took off at 10.50 pm and I reached Ahmedabad at 11.40 pm. This journey was a nightmare, to date I have not been able to reach Akasa Air on customer care, nor is there any apology. Never ever go for this pathetic airline.

### "suggest not to book with Akasa Air"
I had a ridiculous experience in Akasa Air. I booked a ticket from Goa to Bangalore on 8th Aug 2023(7:15 AM). I booked the ticket 50 days before and they have rescheduled flight time multiple times(first 9:45 AM then 1:30 PM again 6:50 PM).I didn't have any option so I was fine with timings. But on 7th, I got a message that the flight got cancelled. I tried to reach them but it took nearly an hour reach their customer care agent. Then I had booked another flight with double price as their was no option. Now Its more than 16 days, I didn't get refund after multiple follow up's. Today I got a refund of 800/- rs where the actual amount was 5,800/-(two persons). I really don't understand their logic. It's a big shame on the Akasa Air service. I suggest not to book with Akasa Air.

### "advise going with Indigo or AirAsia"
I booked the tickets from Bangalore to Goa 2 weeks in advance but, the tickets were cancelled just 2 days before the flight date. We received no information with regards to why the flight was cancelled and when we would be getting a full refund. We waited for more than 3 days for any further communication and got nothing at all. I wrote and email and made a call to the customer service dept. A female picked up my call after waiting for more than 34 minutes. She mentioned that I would get a full refund in 5 business days. I also received a reply to my email confirming the same from a person, mentioning that I would get a refund in 7-10 working days. On the 5th business day we only a received a 25% of the refund. We waited until the 10th business day to see if we might get the other part of the refund - but refund and no further information about when I would be getting the other 75% of the refund. We called customer service and again waiting for a long time, a women picked up and mentioned that we would be getting the rest of the amount in 48 hours, which was a lie as no one is sure about if a full refund is processed or not. We were waiting for more than 3 business days and called the customer service again. This is not a toll-free number and we are charged every time we call the customer service. Finally after 40 minutes a women came online - when we explained the story, she mentioned that she would go ahead and refund the other 75% right away and it should reflect in my account in 3-5 business days. When asked why this wasn't the done earlier, she put me on hold wanting to check more info and never turned up again. The women just switched us from 'hold' to 'mute' making it look like there was a network issue while the called was still connected. I have waited for more than 30 minutes for her to come back online and there was never a response. I send out an email responding to the same chain requesting a refund and have received no response. As said, this airline and the people that work for the airlines are nothing but a scam. Even if you are paying 500 RS to 1k extra, I would advise going with Indigo or AirAsia. At least people respond or give you a full refund when they are unable to run the flight.

### "cancelled the flight giving no reasons"
Not Verified |  They cancelled the flight giving no reasons, ended up paying double the price to get new tickets. If i had taken the current ticket on original booking date, i would have paid almost same amount. They sent a mail asking me to call back. i tried on three occasions and despite holding the line for over 90 minutes, no one attended. Calling from UAE and considering international call charges to India, I have spent more than the ticket charges on telephone itself. So please be cautious while you opt for this airline.

### "recommend not opting for Akasa"
Not Verified |  I booked my ticket thru their website and the website had a glitch due to which I was charged for it but ticket was not issued. On speaking to the customer care team (which connects you after 30min) the amount will be refunded in 7-10 working days. Today it is more then 20 days and I am yet awaiting for my funds. I am a frequent traveller and strongly recommend not opting for Akasa.

### "Indigo is far better option"
Doesn’t understand customer issue, due to Bangalore traffic I reached the airport 5 mins late, they close the counter 1 hour before, even after multiple request they wasted my time and I missed another flight. Reaching counter 55 mins is too much when airport was not crowded. Sometimes I have seen they even convert hand baggage to check in while boarding. Indigo is far better option.

### "convinced me to avoid Akasa Air in future"
Not Verified | I am deeply disappointed during my recent flight experience on August 14th. Staff were rude and unprofessional in response to the flight change and delay from BOM to AMD which was utterly disgraceful. The way they mishandled the situation was not only embarrassing but also reflected poorly on the airline. This incident has left me with a strong resolve never to fly with Akasa Air again. Such an unpleasant encounter has significantly tarnished my perception of the airline's service quality and customer care. Such unprofessional conduct is unacceptable, and this experience has firmly convinced me to avoid Akasa Air in the future.

### "Do not book Akasa Air"
Do not book Akasa Air flights. They have non-existent customer care. My flight was cancelled and they asked me to contact customer helpline number for a refund. I keep trying to call - more than 30 mins without a response, just on hold. This is common if you look at other reviews online. No reply to emails, or social media. It's been almost a month and I am yet to receive any refund. Flight was also cancelled four hours before, with no proper alternatives arranged, I finally booked a new flight and travelled.

### "Very rude behaviour of the staff"
One of the worst airline service. I was travelling Bagdogra to Bangalore. My mom is heart patient, staff are not cooperative. I was keep asking their help, they didn't even bother. Very rude behaviour of the staff.

### "Repeatedly rescheduling the time"
Not Verified |  Worst airlines in India. Repeatedly rescheduling the time. Original time 16.55, Reached time: 17.30. After sometime again reached at 18.40. Totally hopeless. When I enquired about reasons for delay casually told me that weather is not good at destination. I enquired the weather conditions at destination airport, they informed that there is no issues of weather. Akasa Air authority gave false information.

### "cancelled when we went to check in"
Not Verified |  We got to know that our flight to Mumbai was cancelled when we went to check in. It was giving no notification when we tried online check in. No email sent or call received! At the Airport, Manager said they had called some 12 digit junk contact number and I should talk to thirty party sites for this (skyscanner)  No arrangement was done and they just repeated same words 100 times. I had a connecting flight from Mumbai and they were least bothered about it. Later I had to book flight from other airlines for 10x rate

### "cancel at last moment"
Not Verified |  This is a scam airline, never book. They will cancel at last moment. Have only one customer care number which no one picks. Even they do not provide any refund details. Save yourself from hassle it might look cheap but it would cost you peace, time and money.

### "She claimed that we were late"
Not Verified |  Unprofessional staff and horrible service. We were travelling from Goa to Pune. Our flight was on 3:40 and we were about to board after hearing the announcement. We reached at the counter within a fraction of moment on hearing the announcement, however the staff refused us to enter. She claimed that we were late, when we reached there while she was announcing our names. When we asked for the reason, she didn't even had a proper explanation, and instead left the desk. The staff had zero courtesy and politeness. They were not at all amiable. No supportive nature towards the customers.

### "the worst airline in India"
Not Verified |   This airline is the worst airline in India. They have rescheduled every flight I have booked so far and cancelled within 48 hrs of departure time! I strongly suggest passengers not to book in this airline!

### "a wonderful experience"
It was a wonderful experience. Havovi and Co were the epitome of warmth, professionalism, and efficiency. Great experience overall!

### "multiple flights and always delayed"
Not Verified | Do not recommend. Have been multiple flights with this airline and always delayed. Do not have sufficient flights to operate causing delays. Also seats are uncomfortable. Mostly getting booked due to low prices but go for IndiGo.

### "don't recommend this airline"
We booked this airline through an online agent and when we were at the airport to check in, the staff at the desk told us that flight was cancelled and moved us to other flight. Without notifications email or SMS from airline or agent. It was very terrible if we knew in advance then we could manage our plan or buy a new flight earlier. So this caused us to buy a new tickets with Indigo at very expensive price. I don't recommend to risk your plan with this airline

### "Can’t expect a better service"
I was travelling from Ahmedabad to Mumbai and I found Priyanshi at the service window. Can’t expect a better service than that. She is a super enthusiastic personal with a charming personality. She have helped to get me on board on-time. I would have missed the flight without her presence.

### "you feel something is missing"
Although the aircrafts are new and inside decor is set in vibrant colors the moment you step into the cabin you feel something is missing. The crew with the exception of the male steward neither looked welcoming not hospitable. They seemed to be going through the motions and there was no warmth in their demeanour.. I traveled with family from Bangalore to Mopa airport in Goa On 6th Jul. There was another problem with this airline. They accepted bookings for a flight that they didn't operate. They choose to put me on an earlier flight QP1392 instead of QP1398. I incurred an additional charge for the return flight with another airline since they informed on their only 2 weeks ahead of departure. Highly unethical for them to accept bookings in such manner. The 4 in my rating is more for the equipment and airfare. Neither their website nor helpline nor ground staff pass the muster.

### "very rude and unprofessional"
The flight stewards were very rude and unprofessional in Akasa Air. In my last flight from Bangalore to Guwahati, the steward behaved unprofessionally and was rude as I walked down the aisle slow and didn’t rush wile boarding and on being called out, he was absolutely unapologetic about his behaviour. I was in sudden shock and at first didn’t realise what went wrong for him to behave like that. This kind of behaviour isn’t acceptable.

### "they never respond"
Akasa Air cancelled a flight Visakhapatnam to Bengaluru without notifying customers, resulting in a loss of INR 21,000 when booking last-minute tickets. Avoid Akasa Air, they don’t have required infrastructure to operate, they don’t have messaging system to notify passengers, neither they email. They appear to be customer-centric on social media, but when you email them, they never respond.

### "expensive seat cost"
When the crew assistance button is pushed the crew came to my seat almost 3-4 minutes later. There were children sitting in emergency exit bays both in row 15 and in 16, though they were made to sit in some other seat while take off and landing. The crew seems to be more interested in making money than to assist. Unreasonably expensive seat cost. I had to pay 20000 INR as it was urgent. While doing web check in there was no option to auto seat select and was forced to book exit bay seats with paying additional 1400 INR and this felt like a scam, why because there were passengers at last moment that were sitting in some other seats and were allowed to sit in the seats for which I paid extra. Also at last moment some passengers were asked to sit in the seats that I paid extra for and it doesn't seems like that's their seat as no seat number verification was done.

### "One of the worst Airlines"
One of the worst airlines I have ever dealt with. They cancel the flight to  Visakhapatnam segment and give me a notice 2 weeks prior to travel. I planned and bought the ticket 3 months back and now the ticket is 4 times higher than what I bought it for. They should have given at least a month advance notice. No customer empathy. And when I speak to the rep, he feels he is doing a favor by issuing a refund. And asks me to contact the portal I booked ticket for refund money.

### "All my plans were cancelled"
They cancelled my flight on 27 May 2023 and didn't inform me at all. When I reached Ahmedabad airport they didn't allow me to check in. Then they told me about cancellation of my flight. They offered me a flight the next day. I asked for accommodation and meal along with the compensation in accordance with CAR, section 3, Series M, Part IV of DGCA rule and regulations, but they denied to give, they only offered compensation within 7 days. I had to return in 45 degree hot temperature of Ahmedabad towards 2 hour journey to hotel which cost me 2500 per day and 1000 cab fare. All my plans were cancelled due to this. Today it is 06 June 2023 but still I haven't received my compensation.

### "customer support is not good"
Never try this airline. Akasa Air ground staff and customer support is not good. No one can help in airport. My life bad experience in this airline. Everyone just blamed to other..no one help. I have no words for this airline how can describe my problem here. It almost three months completed but at the moment no one help me.

### "Horrible experience"
Horrible experience with Akasa. They rescheduled both my flights. One flight was at 20:15 but was moved to 00:20 and the other from 18:30 to 07:50. Worst airline ever. They give a customer care number but I was never able to connect as the operators were always busy. And currently they are making a fuss over the refund as they are supposed to refund the entire amount if flight is rescheduled by more than 2 hours. I would recommend any other airline but not this.

### "seats have been changed"
We have booked total 3 tickets (windows). My only concern is our seats have been changed without informing or asking us. Later when we asked for the reason they made us to wait for few minutes and a senior guy came with new boarding pass and started yelling that he never seen passengers like us. His point was “I gave you a Business class (3 seats in a row) and why don’t you want it. My point is "we don’t care about class why we want windows seat of our actually paid seats“ the conversation ended with his words telling “I never seen passenger like you“ Me telling “well, you have seen now“ even at last moment I got a window in economy class which is two rows behind my actual seats. Very lame of the kind of response which he have bottom line : everyone don’t ask for business class. It’s their responsibility to make sure passengers get the seats which they have booked and if there is some conflict they should let the passengers know before changing it

### "Overall experience bad"
This was my second flight of Akasa. 1st flight was okay. But this time it was lot of inconvenience. I didn't get boarding pass till I reached airport due to some technical hitch. While check in option online, Akasa displays list of names of all passengers along with their boarding pass which I think is not a good practice and security of passengers should be respected. Why should one know names of people travelling. Overall experience bad and security of passengers very very bad.

### "The worst airline and service"
The worst airline and service! I have booked for the first time and this is the worst decision ever. I booked five tickets for me and my family including two senior citizens. All five of us were allotted with different seats and that too in the middle ones. If that’s not cruel and unethical then what it is? We started our mini vacation with a very happy note but alas the Akasa Air has ruined in the final note!

### "not served my pre booked meal"
One of the worst experiences. Gate change from what was sent via first message to the one at airport was not announced or message was not resent - we had to figure out at the airport. Inflight experience was pathetic. I was seated in row 15D - The inflight attendant was not clear on emergency row - she started explain the emergency procedure to row 12 customer when the emergency rows were 15 & 16. I had inflight meal prebooked - none of the flight attendants bother to ask for servicing the same - when I asked for the same - captain announce landing - so I was not served my pre booked meal. I paid for the same but get the same on board

### "a good experience"
Not Verified | Overall a good experience than previous flights I have gone through. Perfect service management and on-time management. I would rate it a 5 star flight for economy class

### "Lovely in-flight experience!"
The flight was completely comfortable and the food served from Café Akasa was very appetizing. Lovely in-flight experience! The cabin crew was absolutely humble and polite and addressed to every passenger with utmost patience. Very happy with my experience!

### "Definitely will fly again"
Definitely will fly again. Today  first time i travelled in this airline. Was provided premium seats which are wide enough & there is less crowd at counter check & the behaviour of staff are really polite. Also they serve nice food. I am really satisfied with Akasa Air.

### "Very disappointed with this airline"
The staff are very rude and I don’t understand being new airline why this people don’t hire such good trained people. No welcome and such bad behaviour. Even for amount more weight they charge like anything even if you don’t have hand bags. In comparison to IndiG0 or Vistara or go first they have to improve a lot to reach to their level. Very disappointed with this airline.

### "I was treated well"
I was disappointed with the staff at the counter check In at Delhi airport. However, their manager was very cooperative and helped me with my seat assignment. I was treated well by the in flight attendant and was met with all requirements. The take off and landing was very smooth. Baggage clearance was smooth. Just the check in free seats availability should be improvised and worked on: Pls keep all seats available for everyone who has booked tickets as you guys want to be an airline with a tag - affordable for all. Pls don’t charge unnecessarily on extra baggage and seats .

### "Never fly with this airline"
Air Akasa will weigh every single thing you have and then charge you. Per kg extra baggage charges are 550, too much and they call themselves affordable. Never fly with this airline, staff behaviour is not good.

### "cabin service is good"
Pleasant journey with Akasa. Their cabin service is good and travel was on time. They crew did a decent job of keeping everyone comfortable. Will recommend others to try.

### "it just was efficient and smooth"
This is our first flight on Akasa Air and right from check in to boarding it just was efficient and smooth. The staff are friendly and accommodating. Aircraft was new clean and smelt fresh. Would definitely fly this new airline and wish them all the best.

### "definitely fly with them again"
I arrived at the new beautiful North Goa airport and headed to check in counter. Long queues for the various airlines but no one was in the Akasa queue. I approached smiling customer service representatives who took my two pieces of luggage (I had prepaid for 15 kg extra luggage because I was flying internationally,) They weighed them , handed me my boarding pass and said have a nice flight. I have never experienced such an easy check in. Boarding was seamless. They boarded back of the plane first. Plane was full, but didn't take long to board. The plane was impeccably spotless and spacious. Would definitely fly with them again. It took literally one hour from my house, to the airport, thru check in and security, and to the terminal!

### "recommend more than 100%"
Not Verified | I can not thank Akasa Air enough. They helped me as I was travelling with an infant and I forgot my laptop and mobile bag check as my kid is a handful and I remembered when it was take-off time, entire crew worked as one and ensured I received my laptop and mobile and also ensured I don't have to miss the flight. Though it got delayed a bit because of me they waited and on the top of that they also landed the flight in BLR before time. So kudos. I will recommend more than 100%.

### "amazing cheap flexi fares"
This was my second trip with Akasa and I enjoyed the flight and overall experience from Check in to Cabin services to meals. We landed before time which was great, the best part about Akasa is their amazing cheap flexi fares.

### "I loved their services"
Akasa is fairly new to the Indian aviation however I loved their services from ground staff to the onboard Cabin Crew. Akasa being an LCC has the best fares including their flexi fares which I found the best thing about flying with them comparison to other Low cost airlines. I had pre booked a meal which was a special "Holi Festive Meal" it tasted good and was fresh. A choice of complimentary beverage was also included in the fare which was nice. Also another great thing was the free water bottle which is nothing but a dream onboard many other LCCs like Air Asia where they charge even for a bottle of water so I do appreciate Akasa Air for this. Also the Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft was very comfortable with wider windows and great interior mood lighting. Overall a great flight which despite taking off late arrived before time and I would love to fly Akasa again!

### "We had a great experience"
We had a great experience with Akasa Air. Customer service, especially from ground staff in Agartala was exceptional. Check in and boarding was quick and easy, the flight left and arrived on time, our seats were comfortable and we had a great flight.

### "Akasa Airlines is miles ahead"
I travelled many airlines (Air Asia, IndiGo, Akasa) on my recent India trip. Akasa Airlines is miles ahead in Customer service at Airport, Customer Service Call Centre. Very new, comfortable seating and facilities in flight. Flight take-off and landing is also very good, didn't feel that we had landed. Keep up the great work, within no time you'll be India's best airline.

### "Very happy with Akasa Air"
Very happy with Akasa Air services. This is the 2nd time I've flown from Agartala to Guwahati and vice versa and was happy to note that both ground and onboard staff were helpful, courteous and well trained and maintained their standards. They had ontime departure and the aircraft was clean and seemed new. I would fly it again.

### "just had the worst experience"
We just had the worst experience with Akasa airlines. We had booked a flight from Mumbai to Kochi with 5 hours layover in Bangalore. To start with the flight was late to start from Mumbai and thus arrived late in Bangalore. We had 5 hours transit time in Bangalore , so we were hanging out in the airport lounge. But they preponed the flight from Bangalore without any prior information. Obviously we didn't knew about this and missed the flight. Later when we spoke with manager and other staffs of the airlines, they handled the situation quite unprofessionaly and Irresponsibly. As we were transit passengers no airlines can take of the flight without transit passengers. They didn't make any effort at all to get in touch with us initially to inform about the change in the timing and later for boarding the flight. Anyways even after talking with then for a total of two hours they didn't provide us with any suitable alternative options. We had to book hotel and take a later flight on the same day after 12 hours. The money for hotels, transport and food was just a waste from our side to clearly a mistake from their side. I am writing this review sitting in the above said Bangalore to kochi flight and it's delayed.

### "worst experience with Akasa"
I had worst experience with Akasa Air. My flight was supposed to be at 12.50pm but when I reached airport to know that it has been already departed at 7am in the morning, I did not receive any call or message regarding that. I later on checked for any messages that I might have received but I had no message from akasa or goibibo from where we had booked our flight. Now the next flight is at 9.45pm, and we have booked a hotel For 1500 and 2 times meal.

### "a wonderful experience"
It was a wonderful experience overall, crew members are very helpful, every time they assisted us with a warm smile, have ever ever felt such a kind of special assistance.

### "I was impressed"
Took the flight from Bangalore to Kochi and back. This was my first trip on Akasa. I was impressed with their efficiency, punctuality, courteous and friendly staff and clean flights. The flight landed early both ways.

### "spacious and comfortable seating"
Not Verified |  On time, clean, spacious and comfortable seating. One of the lowest fare, very courteous staff, offered free water and was very friendly.

### "Unprofessional and unaware staff"
Worst airline. Don't opt for it. Airline delays by 1 hour minimum. Unprofessional and unaware staff. Advise never to opt got it and book other airlines instead.

### "do not recommend Akasa Air"
Not Verified |  My first flight with Akasa Air was a nightmare. Airport staff is ignorant about flight which had already landed. Bus brought us to a flight destined for Ahmadabad and we waited for 30 minutes after we were asked to reboard the bus to reach flight for Lucknow. Airport staff need to be trained. Akasa operation vendors seems to be cheap and airline managers are careless. I do not recommend Akasa Air.

### "Crew was polite and helpful"
New Boeing 737 Max aircraft, spacious cabin, great leg room. Some aircraft that akasa air uses are ex Jet Airways aircraft that have ample leg room. Akasa cafe is excellent, Checkin was hassle free as i had selected my seat and web check a day earlier prior to my travel. Crew was polite and helpful. USB chargers for mobiles are given in every seat,

### "never recommend any to fly Akasa"
Not Verified |  Booked a flight from Akasa air for only one reason, time of travel was matching as per my work schedule. Writing this review while I’m boarded and wondering why isn’t this flight not taking off. Delayed by 60 minutes, remind you this 60 mins of delay is just to get you inside aircraft, then another 20minutes and going on as I’m writing this review. No announcements from captain or cabin crew stating the reason for delay even after being boarded and boarding is completed. Would never recommend any to fly Akasa. Been a great fan of indigo since many years, don’t remember single flight being delayed while on journey almost every month since last 4 years.

### "it was a great journey for me"
It was my first flight journey from Mumbai to Bangalore. Thank you Akasa air teams for smooth check in , enjoyed my first flight. Overall it was a great journey for me.

### "check in at the last minute in a hurried manner"
Not Verified | Very bad. They don't even have baggage counters. Arrived airport 4 hrs prior to departure time and we had to wait till 1.5 hrs before departure time. They did baggage and quick check in at the last minute in a hurried manner. Had to run with wife

### "quickly turned into a memorable trip"
I travelled from Bangalore to Visakhapatnam with my 2 kids. What could have ended up in a travel disaster was quickly turned around by the ground staff into a memorable trip. While the flight was comfortable, check-in during the peak hours airport rush took me for a ride. With kids I arrived a bit late and the counter was closed. The ground/check-in staff found an opportunity to fit us in and they did the unthinkable. Everything happened with lightning speed and we were on the flight finally with few mins to spare. I really appreciate their hard work and very thankful for the VIP treatment. Although, the baggage arrived a bit late , Its not a big concern at all. I really wish them all the success and growth in their future endeavours.

### "Ticket price is competitive"
LCC currently operating only on domestic route. Have all Boeing 737 Max fleet. Seats are just ok for short 1-2 hr flights, can't expect more from a budget carrier. Boarding was systematic and smooth, cabin was clean and fresh, cabin crew were courteous. Departed and arrived on time. Ticket price is competitive. No major reason to avoid.

### "fret over every last kilogram"
Akasa is removing whatever little dignity was left in low cost air travel (despite not being so low cost). They will fret over every last kilogram in your luggage and make you transfer stuff around and between luggages just to harrass customers as it clearly serves no practical purpose. Terrible boarding and check in process! The staff is untrained, uncoordinated and clueless.

### "Such a worst experience"
Not Verified |  Such a worst experience. My advise people don't book this flight. Nobody bother to address the queries. Not even helping for boarding pass. No early check in baggage facilities. We need to wait till an hour before your boarding. You can't go to Lounge due to this. They don't have kiosk facilities also for boarding pass. So we need to wait till counter opens. Never ever i book again in Akasa Air.

### "Thanks Akasa for a wonderful experience!"
It was my 1st time to fly Akasa Air and was quite sceptical about it since I had read so many negative reviews about the airline. But the experience I got even before boarding the airline till I landed was exceptionally good. Customer helpline operators were really polite, well behaved and really helpful. Flight was on time, no hassle there. The staff were really good. The aircraft, a Boeing 747 was really clean and the inside of it was really colorful and pleasant to look at. The seats were also comfortable with ample leg space for a tall guy like me. The cabin crew members were also very helpful and didn't make a fuss about anything. So overall, the whole experience was positive and made me a happy and a satisfied person. I have absolutely no doubt to fly Akasa Boeing again and I would definitely recommend this airline to everybody. Thanks Akasa for a wonderful experience! (I didn't order any food or beverages and never used the wifi so wouldn't be giving any rating for that).

### "Air hostess was very rude"
Not Verified |  Firstly the flight was delayed by one hour and then when you are in the flight some kind of polite behaviour is required from the staff. Air hostess was very rude when I asked her to help with my luggage. She said that "we are not here to pick up luggage of people". Working with the service industry and answering in this manner to your customer is just not acceptable.

### "Spent around 14 hours in the airport"
Never be flying with 'Akasa Air' again I am a frequent traveller and the experience below is my worse airline experience so far! We booked 2 tickets (different PNR), one was on my name - Ashima Arora and the other was on my husbands name - Nishan Singh. My infant ticket was attached to my husbands PNR. My husband couldn't travel because of some personal reasons. We (Myself and My infant) reached the Akasa Air counter on time (10am it was and the flight was at 11am), my boarding pass was also printed but when the staff realized that my infant was added in a different PNR, he asked me to wait and tried calling the supervisor/manager to check what needs to be done in this case. I was standing there for 30 minutes and constantly reminding the staff about the moving clock. However, he assured me that I need not worry as they'll have me onboard. After 30 minutes at 10:30am, the staff told me that I need to pay Rs1500 to move my child's name in my PNR number from my husbands PNR. I tried to find out the real reason behind the charges as there are airlines that do not charge for it if it has to be from one parent to another parent. It was 10:32am. I took 1 minute to absorb those charges and told the counter staff that I'll pay as I want to board that flight. It was 10:33am. He called someone again (I believe it was a supervisor standing on the boarding gate) in front of me that the passenger was ready to pay now, but the person on the other side refused to take the payment and have us board the flight. So, the staff took 30 minutes to inform me about the next step but did not spare even 3 minutes of time to let me absorb those extra charges I had to pay (for PNR move). We were left there and couldn't board that flight. I waited for the supervisor/manager for another 1 hour and 30 minutes but no one showed up even the staff informed them that the passenger was waiting. I was left with no other choice and I reached out to the airport authority with the concern. When the staff of airport authority accompanied me, only then the supervisor showed up. He started giving some lame excuses that I was already late for the flight at 10:30am and I reached late to the airport. Since they have very less number of flights operational and haven't even tied up with any other airline, they could only place me in the next day flight. And now, I had to pay Rs1500 for moving the infant's name and Rs2000 extra to secure my seat for the next day. And these charges were for one-side travel. Similarly, for the way back from Kochi to BNG I again paid Rs1500 for the infant. I actually had to pay double i.e. Rs6000 which is higher than my ticket's original price for my infant. And additionally Rs2000 more for my ticket too. Spent around 14 hours in the airport with my infant. Lost a day of hotel booking charges too since we were flying for holidays and the holiday package was already booked. When I wrote this concern to their customer support, initially I started getting response with as if I have connected to the wrong team with the concern. After writing to then a number of times, I got a response saying that all fault was of us as passengers and thus, they can't help in any which means without letting me know their source of collecting the facts or the information. The resistance was very clear in the emails I received from the customer care too.

### "Boarding is entire chaos"
I travelled twice within a span of three weeks. Positives: - Inflight service is good - Staff is courteous in flight - Baggage comes on time. Negatives: - Boarding is entire chaos, they dont know how to even organise boarding from gate. - Flight is divided into zones where zone 2,3 and 4 can board early to avoid congestion but no one announces this! Check in staff horrendous - I specifically asked for my paintings to be put the Fragile tag but they didn't put it with the result one of them was destroyed.

### "this airline is always late"
I don't know where to start, this airline is always late. Akasa is undoubtedly known for the delays it causes, mainly by a few hours and sometimes even almost a day. Akasa gave 1 hour time before the departure, as its boarding time, which is atrocious. Today, I was on the way to the airport, when I received a last moment notification stating the delay of my flight QP 1314 by an hour, which was still okay at that point. The madness began when I reached the airport and was lined in the queue for checking in my luggage when the Akasa employees started pulling out other passengers from another flight that had begun boarding. On finally reaching the counters after over half an hour, the ground staff refused to take my luggage as the Departure time was 3.30 pm after the delay, and the "boarding" mentioned by them was 2.30 pm and the time was 2.32 pm. They refused the baggage, and I had to run through security with 15kg of luggage, which had 2 bottles of alcohol. Upon finally reaching the gate, the flight was mentioned delayed again. The boarding did not start before 3.20 pm.

### "Newest of all Indian airlines"
