### "they are just simply shocking"
Not Verified |   Shocking service. Queued up at check in. Scanned our passports and gave us our boarding passes. They then called us back from the gate as there was some kind of error as they shouldn't have given us our boarding passes and we then had to join the end of a queue to have another boarding pass for the same flight and same time issued to us. I would use the word incompetent but that's just not a strong enough word. Please don't use this airline and they are just simply shocking.

### "The service is disgusting"
The service is disgusting. On October 10 I flew from Cairo to Sharm El Sheikh (1 hour). A powerful air conditioner was aimed at my legs. I asked a flight attendant to turn it off. Nothing happened. After 10 minutes I asked her for the second time. Nothing has changed again. She didn't even come and ask if everything is fine and if I feel comfortable. As a result, my feet were cold during the whole flight.

### "Couldn't fault it"
Not Verified |  We flew to Cairo from our Sharm el-Sheikh resort as many others did in order to tour the capital city of Egypt. The aircraft was very comfortable and seemed quite new. They offer great catering for the one hour flight. Couldn't fault it.

### Petroleum Air Services customer review
SSH-LXR-SSH Dash 8 Q-300. A bit dubious as I had never heard of this Egyptian carrier and the name doesn't inspire a great deal of confidence but I was pleasantly surprised. A new aircraft on this short 50 minute flight comprehensive safety demo in English that was understandable. Complimentary juice and a small snack provided I would not hesitate to use this airline again.
