### "cancelled the flight at last moment"
Cancelled the flight at last moment and ruined my honeymoon trip. Beware of this type of airlines as now I try to book another flight but rate increased too much.

### "cancel flight at the last moment"
Not Verified |  The worst ever flight. They cancel your flight at the last moment. The cost of other flights would have jumped by ten times which is not affordable to common man. Their customer service is equally pathetic, their telephone lines are either always busy or do not work at all Probably this could be a scam airline which believes in exploiting the common users. The airline needs to be severely penalized.

### "Will not book Go-First again"
Worst airline. This is the 2nd time we have experienced, that Go-First cancels the flight at last moment, leaving the passengers with no choice but to book other airline at higher price at last moment. Will not book Go-First again.

### "flight got cancelled without any notification"
My flight got cancelled without any notification. Will never book ticket in this airline. I had an emergency so booked flight from Bangalore to Ranchi which as per airline got cancelled. Had to immediately booked another ticket. Who will compensate that amount. Useless staff.

### "there is no sense of professionalism in the staff"
Delaying flights by 5-6 hrs and changing the boarding gates multiple times without any formal communication is the USP of this airline. To top it, there is no sense of professionalism in the staff. They do not seem to care about the passengers at all. While people are waiting to get their luggage checked in 6-7 rows long queues, they would be busy gossiping and staring at the wall. For my last flight from Bangalore, I literally stood at the counter for 10 minutes asking the guy to return my phone and I'd post taking the details and verifying my identification [Not even kidding, he was staring at his colleagues and not doing a thing.] Did not bother to answer my question about a security restricted item or mention the gate number. Then, I was called back at the virtual security check for the same question I inquired earlier. Had to rush back to get it verified and cleared only to know that the flight is delayed yet again without any formal communication. This is not the first occurrence. I had to go through a similar ordeal while travelling from Delhi to Srinagar in October last year where they delayed the flight by half a day, changed the boarding gate 3 times and of course, with no formal communication and passengers trying to figure out any information about the flight without the staff. I understand there are unavoidable glitches at times and there are uncertainties with every airline but there is a way of dealing with it and there's a limit of tolerating this kind of attitude. I am forced to write this review because it isn't just a couple of instances with me. I have heard similar encounters with multiple folks now. This is beyond frustrating.

### "delayed or cancelled frequently"
Never travel via this airline, first is there for namesake only where as their flights are delayed or cancelled frequently. Our flight was scheduled at 9:15 pm on 26th April which was delayed by 45 minutes then they announced people to be in queue for boarding. After waiting for long they informed that it is further delayed by 40 minutes. Then after 40 minutes they had no clue weather it is departing or not. It is then scheduled for 3:00 am next day. Passengers with small children & on wheelchairs suffered a lot. In Pune airport there is no lounge facilities. Boarding area became like a railway station. No one was able to answer. People were left on their own

### "Never go with this flight"
The flight was delayed unnecessarily for invalid reasons. Changed the timings thrice and delayed for more than 2 hrs which resulted in losing my connection train to Varanasi and need to book again a flight ticket to Varanasi in Indigo. Who will take responsibility for the loss of my time and money. Pathetic experience even the check-in staff don’t know how to answer Never go with this flight.

### "seat is not comfortable"
This is the fourth time I am travelling from this airline, and it delayed always. Worst flight as per the punctuality. Never get on time and always the seat is not comfortable

### "don’t expect to be pampered"
After booking this ticket I read the reviews for this airline which are pretty negative, especially about delays. So I monitored my flight in the fortnight before my trip. Of the 14 flights only twice did it go on time, but 10 of the flights the delay was only between 20 & 35 minutes. Once it was just over an hour and once it was 5 hours! Go First is a low cost airline so don’t expect to be pampered. You will be herded on at the airport. They also maximise the usage of the airplane so if it’s delayed on the first flight of the day (say fog at Delhi) then all of its flights for that day will be delayed. So I suggest if you need to be somewhere at a particular time (meeting, wedding, flight connection) then maybe look elsewhere. However if it doesn’t matter too much if you arrive an hour or so late at your destination then use them. The plane was clean, crew courteous, a reasonable choice of purchase food/drinks were available and I would use them again.

### "handled the situation very well"
Not Verified |  I fainted in the flight and where some crew may have panicked in some cases, this crew handled the situation very well. Provided me with all the necessary assistance and first aid and was very kind and humble till the end.

### "changed their schedule frequently"
Not Verified | Had a booking for a direct flight and they changed their schedule frequently and even took money for direct flight and converted with lay over of 6 hours. I do not suggest to go with Go First. Slogan needs to change to Go Last and Nottogo.

### "don't value your customers"
Not Verified |  I had journey with this flight on date 13th April and 17th April. Flight of 13th April was delayed 3 times and of 17th april was cancelled by their end. The airline has no value for customers' time. They are not even concerned to make arrangements when there is any delay or cancellation from their end. As they said, customers get a 100% refund, they don't give that. Dear Airline- Why do you guys cut the airline charges for the flight which is canceled by your end? And you are not bothered about passengers' safety, as delaying by your side made me land late at night and I was traveling alone, I had another journey after landing in Nagpur. Since initially the flight timing was at 6 pm which was going to reach Nagpur by 7.30 pm and was very feasible for me but you delayed it so long and so many times is such a bad service you guys give. I will not recommend anyone this flight to go anywhere. Because you don't value your customers, their time their money.

### "never value time for its customer"
The airline never value time for its customer. This time they have delayed the flight without prior intimation. Reaching to the boarding gate and then you come to know that 2 hour flight is delayed by 3 Hours. No executive present at boarding gate and you have to go back to the enquiry desk and then they tell you that it is delayed by operational reasons.

### "was again late for 3 hours"
Not Verified |  Flight was rescheduled and it was again late for 3 hours. No one to assist us on help desk. Go first do not care about passengers. I would suggest to never opt for go first.

### "Never fly with this airline"
Never fly with this airline. Customer service is pathetic. They rescheduled flight 5 times. Please save yourself from these problems and you will never reach if you are planning to attend any connecting routes or functions. 0 rating

### "Pathetic service"
Pathetic service. Never book a ticket in this airline. They always delay for 4 to 5 hrs at the end moment. Spend more money and take another flight. Spent almost a day from 12.30 to 18.30hrs.

### "Book only if you're ready for reschedule"
Not Verified | Book a ticket with this airline only if you are ready for reschedule. They will make sure it gets rescheduled and most of the time with any announcement.

### "Extremely horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Extremely horrible experience, worse than travelling in an auto rickshaw, the airline is totally non dependable and every day they they change the time randomly. The worst part of my holiday was flying With GO First. Will never again repay the mistake of travelling with GO First.

### "It is always delayed"
My suggestion to all fliers is to never travel by Go First. It is always delayed. While traveling in March 2023, it got delayed by 2 hours. Now, today, 16 April 2023, I am again traveling through this pathetic airline, thanks to the travel agent. And here I am waiting again. It is already delayed by an hour. Lets hope it doesn't change to 2 hours late as always. Also, I was so confused about the gate I have to board through, it is not written on the boarding pass. Neither did the employee tell me about it while receiving my boarding pass.

### "last airline one should opt for"
Not Verified |  Flight was 4 hours late. Started at midnight. Staff very curt and unfriendly towards irate passengers due to the delay Go first is the last airline one should opt for. Across all sectors they keep rescheduling the flight .

### "caused significant discomfort"
I booked a Go First flight for 9:40 pm on April 11, 2023 from Mumbai to New Delhi. However, the flight was rescheduled several times: first to 10:15 pm, then to 11:20 pm, then to 11:59 pm, and finally to 00:55 am on April 12, 2023. The boarding time was scheduled for 00:15 am, but boarding actually started at 01:10 am and the flight took off at 1:50 am. The repeated rescheduling of the flight caused significant discomfort as it resulted in a sleepless night and a disrupted schedule.

### "the worst way to travel by air"
I had booked a flight which was supposed to leave by 7:30 pm from Kochi. This was changed into another flight leaving kochi at 8:00 pm. The second flight was then rescheduled to 9:15 pm which then left kochi sometime around 9:45 pm. The journey start time was 10 min after the original journey end time. Now in flight I was having corporate booking and corporate meal was available in the same, the attendant gave us 2 makhana snacks and a winking cow and a coca cola can . We actually do not drink soft drinks, also we were pretty hungry. When asked about the options available, the crew told us that we can't change anything, not even the drink. Once the flight finally arrived at 11:34 it took me 44 minutes to receive the bag. I am someone who adjusts a lot and rarely complains but this is too much. GoFirst is the worst way to travel by air in India currently.

### "never travel through Go First"
If you really value your time and need peace of mind, never travel through Go First. They will make you wait on the airport more than the fly time. And this is a very frequent issue with this airline. This time the flight got rescheduled more than 4-5 times. And in fact post boarding at the airport 2 hours before the departure, they rescheduled it twice and extended wait time by more than 2 hours. While I am writing this, I am still waiting at the airport as now the revised departure is at 7:50 PM IST.

### "delayed for almost 3.5 hrs"
Worst Indian airline you can ever fly with. No time management of flights. The flight which was supposed to depart at 22:55, took off at 2:15 next day. It was delayed for almost 3.5 hrs. The staff was very unprofessional and had no intention to help.

### "most unprofessional"
I had booked for my family of four, flights from Bangalore to Pune on 1st Apr 2023 and return to Bangalore on 4th Apr 2013. The onward journey flight was delayed for more than 13 hours. Check-in process was most unprofessional. The return journey flight too got delayed for more than 4 hours. The worst part is they will inform the delay at the last moment, when we would have already on the way to airport. Later on enquiry, I came to know that delay in Go First flights is very common. They deliberately schedule flight time in the peak hours and later delay it as per actual timings. Better to travel in bus or train than in Go First.

### "completely stressful situation"
We booked Go First Flight for 9:15 pm, later we got a message that flight has been rescheduled to 9.40 pm. Then it became 10:05 pm and final mail stated departure time will be 10.30 pm with arrival time as 1.10 am and in the end when we reached airport we got to know that it has again been rescheduled to 11:30 pm. This has resulted in completely stressful situation because we had booked our bus from Delhi to Uttarakhand which was supposed to leave Delhi from 2:.00 am. Now clearly we would leave the Delhi airport post 2am after taking our luggage which also came quite late and are sure to lose that bus too and our hard earned money.

### "Worst airline ever"
I had booked a flight with Go First and it was supposed to fly from Ahmedabad to Phuket with 3 hrs of layover at Mumbai Departure Time - 00:40 on 31st of March Arrival Time 11:15 on 1st of April The flight got cancelled and I got shifted to another flight and they didn't even inform me. It is when I checked the booking for my seats, it shown that the flight has been changed with 7.5 hrs of layover at Delhi. So basically my overall flight time got extended 4 hrs and 45 minutes and I wasn't even informed about it. I had to call them to get this update. And when I asked them to provide meal as the flight got changed from their side, they are not ready to do the same. Worst airline ever.

### "The worst airline ever"
The worst airline ever, I had booked a morning flight at 9 am and then it got rescheduled endless times and I ended up rescheduling to 12.40 am, can you believe it? The date changed when I actually boarded the flight, please don't ever book with this airline, pathetic departure time, not Go First but Go last. Don't ever go for this one.

### "the flight is preponed"
Not Verified |  Actual time was 6.45 pm. It was informed yesterday that the flight is preponed to 5.15 pm and I had to rush leaving half work to reach airport. After 4.30 it's displayed as delayed for 25 minutes. Finally flight took off after 6pm.

### "Very bad experience"
Very bad experience the flight was rescheduled for 5 times from the time of booking. Initially it was scheduled was in morning then in evening and then late evening then at night then late night and then next day.. customer care service is pathetic over call and at counter. They just have one dialog we are sorry this is due to airport authorities issues. Never seen such a bad service. My father is paralyzed person and we chose this flight just because of of its early departure. Please don't book and travel by this company flights.

### "Flight was delayed 4 times"
The pathetic service. Flight was delayed 4 times. No one is there to take responsibility or to answer. People don't know whom to ask because no single staff is there to attend. Extremely irritated

### "rescheduled the flight 2 times"
I suggest you never book the flight via Go First. They rescheduled the flight 2 times on the day of departure without giving a reason of operations. All the further plans are dropped due to this delay. Worst Experience.

### "I'm never booking through them again"
At first they cancelled my direct flight to Bangalore and gave me the connecting flight which took 13 hrs for the whole trip. They didn't even take responsibility or give me accommodation in Delhi as the waiting time was a lot. As I had a stop in Delhi that was also at night I couldn't stay anywhere else except for the airport. They were not letting me enter the airport at first saying the flight is not valid. After a lot of inconvenience and checking they let me enter. And after that they didn't let me go for hand baggage check-in saying I should come after 12 am. Like having a 13 hr journey is not enough. I'm never booking through them again.

### "Very pathetic experience"
I booked my ticket from Mumbai to Nagpur for 19th march and return on 21st march evening. Booking was done on 7th march. In my Mumbai to Nagpur journey they didn't even offer water to economy class passengers. Also return flight on 21st was cancelled. Very pathetic experience.

### "Such a painful experience!"
Not Verified |  One of the worst experiences. On 26.01.2023, I booked my flight for 31.03.2023. Go first modified the flight time by preponing it more than 12 hours and informed the same to me on 23.02.2023. Finally, on 22.03.2023, they are informing me that the flight has been cancelled! This would have been my 1st flight with Go First. But now, I am 110% sure that, in future I am not going to fly with Go First. Further, the name of the operator may be changed to Go Last! Such a painful experience!

### "really thank the cabin crew"
I travel with my two friends from Bangkok to Delhi, unfortunately we are late on that day and when we get our boarding pass our three seats are in different areas. After taking off i see some seats are empty on first and second row, my co passenger tells me these seats are chargeable. 15 min after taking off flight I request to cabin crew for giving us three seats together in second row nd she tells me all seats are vacant but these seats are chargeable but she speaks with me politely and give us three seats without any cost. I really thank the cabin crew.

### "The airline is not worth it"
The airline is not worth it, most of their flights are delayed they had delayed three flights continuously on 18th of march by more than 2 hours and they did not provide any sort of compensation, no meal or apology, They had the audacity to say sir we can refund your full amount - who is gonna pay for the expense one made to come to airport and go back and book another hotel because you guys delayed someone's flight by 2 hours. Fly with indigo instead of them

### "zero value for money and negative convenience"
Not Verified |  The worst airline ever! Please never ever book from Go First even if you have to spend a little extra. There is zero value for money and negative convenience. Last time I flew with my mother and she was little sick and then the airline told us that the flight got further delayed by 1.5 hour. It was so cold and my mother's health kept declining and there was nothing we could do about it. Later, I tried a lot to contact their team and ask for refund but I got no response. So please, never book from Go First. It's absolutely the worst!

### "Such a poor experience"
Such a poor experience. Flight delayed by 3 hours. Luggage claim was much delayed due to their poor System. I was supposed to be free by 11.45 pm, but was stuck in airport till 4 Am in morning.

### "Pathetic experience with this airline"
Pathetic experience with this airline. Many time they rescheduled my flight without any call. Just drop a simple message. Even customer care people are very arrogant. Will never travel again with this airline and never recommend.

### "Service after sales is poor"
Service after sales is poor - negligible actually. Flight is late 3 hours. How can flight be late 3+ hours, still we are waiting in goa airport right now. We even don't know whether flight gets delayed further or not.

### "Worst experience"
Worst experience, not recommended. Check in is closed before 1hour. We were waiting in line, they directly said it is closed. Nearly 30 people had the same problem in that line. They don’t even consider. Time, money and efforts are wasted. Not happy at all.

### "Frequent cancellation"
Not Verified | The worst flight experience ever. Pathetic service. Frequent cancellation. Long waiting hour for connecting. My too and fro both got cancelled at last moment. Even after booking prior to a month. As per the tag line you are first - I doubt any time that we are first. Apart from being economical rest nothing assured. If you are travelling for any important work. Keep two days additional else you are expected to get delayed for sure.

### "cancelled few hours before the departure"
Not Verified |  I had booked a ticket from Pune to bengaluru. It was rescheduled with 2 hours delay and notified over call. And then with just an email notification they cancelled few hours before the departure. And i had to raise call and go through procedures to claim refund with some deductions in it. And the worst part is, airlines mistake is making customers pay money. I don't know when this will learn to serve customers.

### "would never recommend"
I was surprised to receive a call from Go First airlines wherein they informed that the flight which I was suppose to board on 5th March 2023 from Lucknow to Bangalore has been cancelled due to operational reasons. I was completely shocked as, I had to board this flight on 5th March 2023 and I received the call on 1st March 2023. When I asked them to provide me another flight, they informed me I have two options 4th March: 7:15 PM will reach on 7:20 AM (next day 5th march): lay over at Mumbai 4th March: 2:25 PM will reach on 11:25 PM: Mumbai I have asked them to give me a direct flight, they said there are no directs flights either on 4th or 5th, because they have only one flight from Lucknow to Bangalore. I am surprised that how come an airline is only providing single flight to such a big City Bangalore. This was the worst experience of my air travel. I would never recommend in my family and friend to book any ticket in a worst airline Go First

### "treats its customers so shabbily"
I booked Go first for the first time and this will be my last. The  flight was scheduled at 1735. It was rescheduled to 2035 and then canceled. I am booked for another flight by the airline scheduled at 2359-0135 , which again got rescheduled for 2359-0305. All of this in a day. Had I been informed earlier I would have booked some other airline. However, continuous changes didn’t allow me that option also. The airline should wind up its operations if it doesn’t have resources and treats its customers so shabbily.

### "It was horrible experience"
From Delhi to Goa trip flight was delayed by 4 hours without informing. It was horrible experience to wait for 4 hours. They charge too much by showing morning flight around 10:45 am and then flight comes around 3 pm. There should be some penalty regarding flight delay without a valid reason.

### "avoid the airline at all cost"
One of the worst airlines. They delayed our flight by 3 hrs without informing the passengers. We had to wait for 2 hrs without any notice. The staff was rude and were arguing with the passengers instead of helping them. When questioned about departure they were avoiding to comment on it. The cabin crew were busy among themselves so no greetings to the passengers. Overall avoid the airline at all cost.

### "closes one hour prior to flight"
Not Verified |  I was denied boarding one hour prior to flight. I have never felt such helplessness as I was left stranded with my family. They told that their check in process closes one hour prior to flight. This happened with me at Port Blair. Avoid this airlines if possible.

### "delayed without any notice"
First, the flight was delayed without any notice. When the passengers started inquiring, they started to a far away gate. And there the gate was not open and passengers were just stuck there. And then they finally opened the gate and took us in a bus. And the flight was near the first gate where they started the boarding process. The flight attendants were busy hiding their faces and hence no greetings and during the flight, they were very rude. And upon arriving Delhi the flight was roaming above Delhi sky for another half and hour. Never take a Go First flight.

### "Worst Service ever"
Worst Service ever. They already delayed the journey twice and still we haven't left Mumbai. We were supposed to reach Delhi by 11.30pm and we are leaving Mumbai at 1.23am the next day.

### "don't know the meaning of hospitality"
Worst flight ever. Zero service. Flight was delayed by 5 hours. No notification was received plus when I was asking there staff about the reason for delay in flight no one was answering and were running here and there from 8 in the morning. I was sitting there till 4pm, no lunch was offered to us then your inflight staff who have no manners how to speak to the guest. Staff don't know the meaning of hospitality

### "Horrible service"!
Horrible service. The only flight was delayed today. No timely intimation for delay. Staff at Jammu airport especially check in staff is unprofessional. Please don't for this airline.

### "experience was really bad"
First of all go first flight was the only flight which was delayed. Secondly as I usually fly this time the experience was really bad, the cabin crew were very rude. I was sitting on the wing so that's fine that I needed to keep my luggage up but the way the female cabin crew asked to keep was very rude. I mean we all have some reputation if we are flying that doesn't mean that cabin crew have the right to shout on us. They are been trained to manage every problem politely but nowadays cabin crew are becoming very rude

### "Worst airline in India"
Worst airline in India. Always late unapologetic staff. Consistent terrible experience. Not sure why they are allowed to operate at all. Will never fly this airline again

### "Ridiculous excuse of an airline"
Haven't had such a terrible experience with any other airline and consistently terrible at that. The flights are consistently late, change gates without prior or even any notice. Flights get cancelled and the time of a flight is changed always without any intimation. Always. They literally prepone it and postpone it without telling you and then say it's non refundable. Ridiculous excuse of an airline. Never again. Please don't fly with them.

### "Such a bad flight"
Such a bad flight. I was traveling from Srinagar to Bangalore on 27th of January. The flight got delayed, cabin crew shown no respect at all.

### "Complete mismanagement"
Pathetic service. Changed direct flight to Connecting flight without any intimation. Cabin crew and Ground support team had no clue with what was happening. 5 hrs flight was delayed by 2 hours. Complete mismanagement.

### Go First customer review
I booked Bengaluru to Kochi, original Time was 5.10 and the flight got rescheduled for three times and it's got rescheduled to 7.05 in the night. I never experienced such a worst experience in my entire life, and customer care saying if your flight got rescheduled more then 2 hrs then only will be an option to change the flight. They sayi1.55 min is not sufficient for them to say 2 hrs. Don't book through Go First unless you have plenty of time to waste...

### "Such a pathetic service"
Such a pathetic service. No value for customers time and money. This the third time I am having this bad experience from the airlines. The flight always gets delayed by at least one to one n half hours. Because of the delayed flight I missed my train. So much inconvenience from the go first. Highly dissatisfied. Would never recommend

### "charged me to carry my musical instrument"
This was the first time that someone has charged me to carry my musical instruments. I mean the ticket was 3000 rupees and I checked in 3 instruments, they charged 1500 per instrument. It's not over yet these people have a policy in which they allow only one bag per person, but the weight that is allowed in is 15 kg, so if you are wondering if you can carry 2 bags one of 10kg and one of 5, they'll merely refuse to take it. Now the foremost juncture, our flight was at 14:50, and our motive to visit was met so we decided to go to the airport a bit early, and guess what, the luggage scanning machine was off there was no representative of "Go First", we had to ask the representative of the other companies that where are they, and I was stricken dumb to hear the reply, they said and I quote "Go First people will be here in half-hour, you guys are early". This was it is the last time I'm travelling with this horrible air service. I just want to say one last thing if you budget issue and only this flight is available, travel train.

### "Pathetic service"
Not Verified |  Pathetic service. I have booked 9pm flight from Nagpur to Pune. They have rescheduled the flight at 10:30 pm. It means I will land in Pune around 12 pm. As an alone woman I don't feel safe to travel further in Pune because I have to go to Talegaon. The airline is not providing me any solution. They should provide a full refund in such cases.

### "Trust this company at your peril"
I booked a flight for myself and my daughter on 03 September 22, due to fly on 03 Jan 23 through Expedia. On 04 Oct 22 they cancelled my flight. I have sent countless emails and received no response. I called the call centre from the UK and was told that the money had been refunded to Expedia. I called Expedia and they said this never happens and called the GF centre and were told I'd have my refund in 2 weeks. Nothing happened. I called expedia again who chases up and was told it would be 8 weeks. I waited 8 weeks and called again. Still no refund. Still no reply to over 10 emails. Nothing. This is the absolute worst customer experience I have ever had in my life. I would not recommend this airline to anyone. I only wish I'd found this page of reviews first. I'm still owed money for two flights. Trust this company at your peril. You have been warned

### "Most horrible airline"
Most horrible airline. Rescheduled flight 3 times on the day of departure before finally cancelling it. Had to book an Indigo flight at the last moment for double the price to get back to work. Am really ashamed that the government allows this so called airline to operate in India.

### "Pathetic service"
Not Verified |  Pathetic service. These people will never provide a direct flight. They will always cancel the direct flight for which you paid for and will give you the option to choose their alternative connecting flight or refunding the money. They did the same with me, my sister and my brother. They informed us just a week before the due to some technical reason the flight got cancelled. Taking a refund was not an option for me because the price of other flights were really high the time they informed us. So I was only left with the option to take the 8 hrs long connecting flight.

### "Overall a pathetic experience"
Pathetic service from all fronts. Who ever is the head of customer service seems to ignore customer feedback or doesn't care and the same trickles down and has become the culture at Gofirst. Flight was Delayed. Asked for water to the flight attendant, was told to wait since the cart service was due shortly, it took 5 minutes and the attendant seemed to forget I asked for water. I asked again and was given water along with a rude look. Baggage belt 1 was mentioned but baggage came to belt 2. My bag was damaged and half opened. When I complained to the customer service person there. they asked me to email gofirst customer service. I chose to tweet to their handle, which replied at least 10 times with bot like responses and kept asking for my email and phone number. Overall a pathetic experience, I used their service the first time and will never use it nor recommend anyone to use it. They are the worst airline service provider I have experienced.

### "Third class service"
Third class service. They are rescheduling flight timing multiple times. Better option train or bus services or another flights, not Go First. very disappointing. I will never prefer this flight.

### "don’t care for the passengers time"
Worst airline ever. They delayed the flight first by 3 hrs and then by 1 more hour. Front desk wasn’t helpful. No compensation is provided. They don’t care for the passengers time.

### "do not book if you value your time"
Please do not book this flight if you have any important meetings and value your time. Make sure you book any airlines but Go First. Irony in the name of the airline.

### "No professionalism"
Useless airline. DO NOT fly this airline though their airfares are cheap. It is better to catch a train one day prior instead of flying this airline. In the last 3 months I flew this airline 5 times and in all instances it was delayed by more than 4 hours. No professionalism! !

### "Absolute shambles of an airlines"
Not Verified | Absolute shambles of an airlines. Flights being delayed for over 8 hours. Wish could give a rating a below one. One of the only airlines who do not consider customer satisfaction. Would never recommend.

### "change flight just one day before"
Not Verified | Pathetic service. Randomly change flight just one day before departure without providing any alternatives. But within time frame where they do not fall in any legal obligation.

### "flight got rescheduled 7 times in 2 days"
Not Verified |  My flight got rescheduled 7 times in 2 days! Multiple last minute delays and so unreliable. Never fly Go First. Extremely unreliable and poor management.

### "Never travel by Go First"
I don't understand why do they run an aircraft when their flights are delayed by 6-8 hours on average? The customer care executive told that they have the right to cancel /delay / prepone as per their wish ... passengers have no right to ask question. They are informing us about the delay is a obligation to us. Never travel by Go First.

### "airline is extremely unreliable"
Not Verified |  The airline is extremely unreliable. Multiple last-minute delays in the flight departures and last-minute cancellations too. Would not recommend to anyone to book Go First tickets

### "Extremely poor airline"
Extremely poor airline. Have no control over the operation of their flight, and have in trained staff. I took 2-3 flights with them, all were delayed by more than 2 hours. Will never fly with them.

### "Courteous cabin crew"
LCC so fly with low expectations and experience would be good. On time departure and arrival, boarding experience ok, what can airlines do when people are desperate to board breaking the queue. Clean and fresh cabin, ok seats for short journeys. Courteous cabin crew, snacks and beverages on sale on board, if wants sandwich or something like that need to book during booking.

### "Decent experience"
Decent experience, early morning Delhi to Ahmedabad, on time departure and arrival. Clean cabin, seats not so comfortable but ok for up to 2 hr flight. Food and beverages Available on board on payment. Courteous cabin crew.

### "beginning of a worst nightmare"
I recently travelled from Bagdogra to Delhi via Guwahati and my biggest mistake was to choose Go First. I booked this flight since it was a morning flight and I had to reach Delhi early but my flight got delayed by 4 hrs, and since I wasn't aware of this I reached airport early. The airport staffs were so rude they refused to take my luggage. So i waited there for few hours and finally my luggage was taken with rudeness. When I thought it was all over it was just the beginning of a worst nightmare. After waiting for few hours I got to know our flight was again delayed by 50 mins. We kept on waiting and just when we thought they will begin the boarding they said the gate no. Has been changes from gate 4 to gate 2! I was already so late and now even frustrated with everything. During the flight the hostesses were so inhospitable, they were very annoyed when other passengers were calling them for help. They were so rude and impolite and surely were unaware of the word kindness. When we were deboarding I couldn't reach my hands to my cabin bag as it had slid inside and I was struggling to get it i asked the hostess to help me with it who was just few feet away standing. Her literal words were " I can't come there you have to do it by yourself" Thankfully another passenger heard it and helped me with it. Just wanted a peaceful travel and had my worst nightmare come true. Never going to choose this airline again.

### "do not book a Go First flight"
This is my second experience with GO FIRST and it is as terrible as the first one. They keep on delaying and delaying the aircraft as if the passengers have all the time in the world and then they say sorry for inconvenience. Actually they are not sorry at all. From 11:50 pm departure it has shifted to 2:05 am and nobody at the airport knows nothing. If you all want to save your time and your money, do not book a Go First flight.

### "nacks and beverages on paid basis"
Early morning flight was from Bangalore to Kolkata. Boarding on time, also reached on time. Cabin of all Indian LCC are almost same ,same leg room, just ok, cabin was clean. Staff were courteous, basic snacks and beverages on paid basis.

### "They never value their customer"
This airline either cancels the flight or it gets delayed. They never value their customer. This is always a problem with Go First. Never recommend to travel with this airline. They reschedule multiple times for a single flight as experienced on 15 October 2022

### "worst experience with any flight"
I am flying with Go first for first time. Go First with above flight details is so delayed. People are struggling to get updated flight time. Still no confirmation about rescheduled time. This is my worst experience with any flight. They ruined night and day . Worth nightmare. Will never come again with this flight. We have other connecting flight , who will bear the charges. We need answer about rescheduled flight time

### "they don’t care about customers"
Refused to give boarding pass and check baggage in because I was early by 5 hrs prior to departure. I requested multiple times to let me go in coz I was travelling from Houston to Kolkata and tired but they didn’t respond. Ground staff behaviour was so rude and they don’t care about customers. I recommend all not to try this airline, all other airlines allows you to check in even 8 hrs prior to departure.

### "They are your worst nightmare"
I booked a flight from Delhi to Maldives and back on GoFirst, both were direct flights. Few days prior they canceled return flight for no reason and offered only one option with a connection that would take us 18 hours instead of the original 4 hours. Tried to reach them thru call center but couldn't after waiting 45 mins, Their Chat Help is a useless bot their website is even worse, Tries for hours to cancel and get a refund but no luck. Anyways I just had to go ahead and book a different flight. Bad experience but it got even worse. The day before we were to take off for our vacation, they sent a SMS and canceled the inbound flight as well and offered us such a lousy long connection that we had to cancel that flight as well and book an Indigo instead. It took us a whole day to get a hold of someone who was not even sorry. It has now cut our 4 days vacation down to 2.5 days and we forcibly bought more expensive tickets with long connections with no help from them ... for no other reason than that we selected to go with an airline that prides itself on being "Customer First. What a sham! Cheap stunt of an airline this is. They are your worst nightmare.

### "the worst airline"
Not Verified |  Writing this review after almost 10 attempts to fly with GoFirst and the flight has been cancelled at every single instance. This is the worst airline. They have an extremely unethical business practice of showing flights on online portals that you book and then cancelling them. Apparently, they do not deem it fit to inform you in advance that the flight is cancelled and you have to continuously check it on their portal to learn for yourself that the flight is cancelled.

### "non-courteous, non-accommodating staff"
Worst, non-courteous, non-accommodating staff with merely any respect for anyone's time or schedule. Initially the airlines changed the travel date during the onwards journey without any notice or anything and did not have any provision to cancel the flight except for making a call to the customer care and being on hold for hours. During the return journey which was supposed to be a direct flight of 2 hours 30 minutes they changed it to a flight with layover at Bengaluru of around 3 hours 30 minutes. Which upon arriving to Bengaluru they were informed that their flight has again be rescheduled and the wait period changed from 3 hours to 8 hours. So, in all initially a ticket was booked with a journey duration of 2 hours 30 minutes has now become a journey which would take more than 8 hours. I wish I had an option to give 0 stars. No cooperative. Non-accommodating staff

### "subjecting us to enormous hardships"
Not Verified | Maldives to Delhi. We booked a return flight from Delhi to Maldives. Our return flight from Maldives on 22nd September was cancelled and we were made to take a flight via Bengaluru subjecting us to enormous hardships of disembarking at Bengaluru, multiple security checks and luggage check in, delay in reaching the destination. We were told at Maldives that this is a regular practice of Go First. They book the return tickets and subsequently cancel the return flight several times in a week when the passenger has no choice.

### "Seat pitch are just ok"
Good experience. Go first is low cost carrier so nothing big expectation. Aircraft was A320,cabin was clean. Seat pitch are just ok for a short flight of one to 2 hrs, anyone above 6 feet can have some uncomfortable journey, suggest to book extra leg room seats. Boarding was on time so as departure and arrival. They sell some beverages and ready to cook items on board, if wants cooked food or sandwiches then have to book in advance.

### "get ready to face some surprises"
Airline don't care about passengers luggage, you can see my luggage pictures attached. This was brand new luggage, only 10 days old. When I checked in there was not a single spot on the bag and when received my luggage in Amritsar it was hard for me to recognize my luggage, it was full of oil stains and very dirty. More over when I tried to complain to the Go First staff, instead admitting and finding the solution they were telling me, this is not happened by them and can't do anything. This is not oil stains and we don't know how and where your luggage get messed up. I told them you check any footage you can find there was nothing wrong with my luggage but all that was wastage of time. I have decided, will never travel again in this airline and I will suggest every one else before you book on this airline get ready to face some surprises.

### "They don't care for customers"
They don't care for customers. Go first cancelled the flight abruptly. They don't even have courtesy msg or email to customer about cancellation. They can put you in any flight of the day or night without checking. Front desk is the worst, they forgot basic courtesy. Very rude. Customers are last for them

### "worst experience I had"
The worst experience I had in a flight journey. The flight departure was 9 pm, it got delayed by 3 hours. No intimation of flight delay. Gofirst is a third class flight. The staff not giving a proper explanation of delay.

### "Horrible customer service"
Horrible customer service. They rescheduled the flight and sent me an email for the same. But this email had the incorrect time mentioned in it. When we reached the check in counter they simply told me that the flight had taken off and nothing could be done now. No help/solution provided from their staff even though it was their mistake of mistyping the correct flight time. After a lot of struggle with them, they charged us for a layover flight for us which delayed our travel time by more than 24 hrs. They did not provide any accomodation even though we were 3 females and had to wait overnight for the next flight. Our route was Bengaluru to Bombay and the Layover provided to us was Lucknow. Extremely pathetic attitude displayed by the Bengaluru Go First staff. Never travelling by this airlines ever again.

### "I had a very bad experience"
I had a very bad experience with Go first. I booked a connection flight from Delhi to Kannur via Mumbai. Two days prior to the flight date i have got a message saying there's a delay in the flight from Delhi to Mumbai. When I checked the rescheduled time Gofirst has provided me a very unrealistic connection flight time in such a way that my first flight will reach Mumbai five minutes after the second flight departure from Mumbai. When I contacted their customer care they didn't even provide any solution. So I asked them if i can cancel the first flight and board second flight from Mumbai. Then they denied it saying flight is overbooked (The flight which I have already booked with full payment). The same flight available online with a higher amount at same time. When I questioned it they said they will consider my partial cancellation but still they haven't get back on the refund status. So I had to book another flight to reach Mumbai and board the second flight. Never going to choose go first again

### "No sense of responsibility"
Delhi to Dehradun. Pathetic service. No clear communication once the flight was cancelled. No sense of responsibility. At the end moment they have cancelled the flight without giving full refund or alternative flight.

### "Seriously poor airline"
They reschedule the flights constantly. My flight is unrecognisable from the one I booked. I book flights based on timings and convenience of taking 2 young kids with me. Then Go First reschedule them, 3 times so far, to flights that will be utterly miserable, dragging 2 kids through various busy airports, getting bags, changing terminals, waiting for 5 hours, all in the middle of the night instead. And cancel any alternatives which might make the journey any more bearable. Seriously poor airline. Never again.

### "Very pathetic service"
Very pathetic service. This airline don't have any respect towards the customers important time. They don't care whatever work they have. Or they will be able to travel after arrival or not. It feels like standing at a local bus stop for bus. The the nonsense crew doesn't have any idea of anything if you do enquiry. It's not first time I'm facing this. One or twice we can understand. But every time and with all my know people who frequently fly. They all try to avoid this nonsense flight. It always spoils all the planned work.

### "Okay experience for a short flight"
Gofirst a low cost carrier, all A320 fleet with 31 row seating configuration. My flight was early morning Delhi to Ahmedabad, boarding experience ok, flight departed on time and same for arrival. Cabin was clean and fresh and so was toilet. No inflight entertainment. Okay experience for a short flight.

### "Very pathetic service"
Very pathetic service. Scheduled time of flight was 6:00 am. It was departed at 8:30am. Bad example of team work. Cabin crew did not know the reason what Ground staff was doing. Specifically, ground staff appeared to be confused all the time. No tea or coffee offered to passengers at all. Bad food service. I was travelling with my family. My family warned me not to book this airline in future. Time is money for all but not for this airline.

### "Worst flying experience"
Not Verified |  Always reshedule/delays the flights. Online check-in doesn't allow to select seats. Changed seats in flight as well, due to various reasons given by staff. Worst flying experience. Not recommended.

### "Worst experience ever"
Pathetic service. Worst experience ever. I won't recommend to take this airline, it's worth avoiding. I was traveling with my family from Bangalore to Pune. They rescheduled my flight 4 times on a same day, even when we reached airport (2hrs before) they rescheduled it again in the last moment by 45 minutes delay. Poor management. Person on the ticket counter said you don't need hardcopy of boarding pass, I was travelling with my 7 months old son, they said you don't need a separate boarding pass for him it's mentioned on his mother boarding paas as infant. But when we reached checking place they asked me to go and bring the separate boarding paas. They should train their employees properly before placing on live counter, it's not onjob training. I have to again travel back to ticket counter, again follow the line and then returned. Waste of time and Bangalore airport is a big one you have to travel a lot. When we reached Pune, we went to get our luggage on the luggage belt. We found our new red big suitcase turned into black with some substance all over it. When we asked on help desk, they bring the 'Go First' representative. He was so rude & arrogant, he said it's common, and it's not our responsibility. It is just dust, I asked him to clean up if it's only the dust then he replied it's not our responsibility to take care of ur luggage, you may complaint or write a feedback or check the policy online. This is the way the respond.

### "very pathetic service"
11 Aug 2022: Flight No 2603 actual departure time was 1150 hrs. Rescheduled at 1340 hours. Again rescheduled at 1415 hrs. There is no sign of boarding of the flight. It is very pathetic service.

### "never choose this airline again"
Not Verified |  We were on time at the Airport but Nobody of Go First was at the international transfer counter to do our Check in (2 hours before Boarding). We were told to wait but Nobody came until half an Hour before departure after several requests from us somebody of another Airline tried to Help us. In the end Go First refused us to get on the flight. Very bad organisation. I will never choose this airline again.

### "airline is worth avoiding"
Rude cabin crew. Go First is a LCC ,earlier it was Goair but later rebranded itself as Go First, its management should understand that just changing names doesn't matter, its the service which matters, changing schedule in last moment is very common with Go First. This time flight departed on time but crew were extremely rude. Aircraft was clean as it should be, flight departed on time. The aircraft was almost one third empty, from row 21 to 30 I was the only passenger, this was rare to see so I just took a 5-6 seconds of a video in which no passenger or cabin crew was captured, only empty seats and 2 cabin crew appeared and asking me to delete the video. This airline is worth avoiding now.

### "denied to give boarding pass"
The flight was scheduled at 5.55am from Bangalore and I reached the boarding pass counter at 5.07am but staff at counter has denied to give boarding pass and yet flight was not departed. The staff at counter saying you are late. This is first time i was travelling alone and such a rude behavior from Go First staff spoiled my journey, staff suggested to pay more for next flight at evening. I will never ever recommend this flight to anyone and very mush disappointed from the staff behavior and service.

### "bad service from the staff"
Not Verified |  Ground staff in Mumbai was unhelpful when my luggage was missing. Staff lied and showed no care for my luggage, instead sat there and talked on their phones completely ignoring me. When calling the staffers on their lie they his their name tags and refused to call supervisor or take any action while hiding their name tag. Not upset about the luggage as much I was about the bad service from the staff.

### "Cabin crew were courteous"
Ok experience, not bad, only had cabin baggage so no check in experience. Boarding was on time, aircraft was clean and hygienic, seat pitch was just like any budget carrier, ok for 1-2 hr journey. Cabin crew were courteous, didn't book meal so can't comment. Reached destination on time.

### "Flight delayed by 2.5 hours"
Not Verified |  Flight delayed by 2.5 hours. Initially they announced 35 min delay from 4:55 to 5:30 pm. But flight took off at 7:20 pm with no further announcement from pilot. This airline has been consistently delayed for last few days of my travel date, but delay on my travel day was really above the limit. Who will enforce these type of airlines to follow punctuality?

### "really a bad experience"
The worst experience I had while travelling in an aircraft and not friendly to the passengers. Especially the counter staff are so rude to the passengers and talks back as if we did not take the ticket. Its really a bad experience and suggest not to take Go First.

### "never fly this carrier please"
I bought a ticket from Goa to Delhi, canceled the flight the day before departure, without explanation, did not return the money on request, pure deception, never fly this carrier please.

### "there are no free seats available"
Go first does not allow to check in without additional payment for seat selection, I mean there are no free seats available. All airlines provide payment seat for customers who wish to select seats and the free seats options are available for web checkin last 24 hrs of departure. We have saved the screen shots and contacted customer care but they are insisting that additional payment required for seat selection and check in process . They could not solve this in time and due to the delay we would have missed the flight. Our friends could not join us as flight was overbooked and seats were not available.

### "the worst airline I have ever flown"
This is literally the worst airline I have ever flown. Pathetic aircrafts, unempathetic staff (cabin crew were OK, rest were the worst service professionals), lack of discipline, professionalism, accountability, responsibility. It all started with unorganised boarding with people pushing against each other with no sense of social distancing. Then there was an un-announced delay. Flight was supposed to take off by 21.45 IST but didn't and then came a shocker of an announcement only a good 45 mins later that - there has been a technical malfunction with the plane. I had to demand to be made aware of the exact issue and only then was I informed of the pilot's windscreen fogging. But the real surprise was their audacity to not let the passengers know of the exact issue. I was plainly told that there is nothing that can be done and was given a choice to walk out of the plane without any refund or care for accommodation. The flight took off only 2.5 hours later and landed at destination at 1 AM in the night. It was another 1.5 hours of travel to my home from the airport. I am never flying this incompetent airline that seems to be run my a bunch of teenagers.

### "I will never ever choose this flight"
I have done an online booking in thus first. After payment upon seat selection. It wouldn't allow me to select seat since all were Grey and not available. Only paid seat were available for selection. I proceeded thinking that on web check in I will be able allocated seats. Upon my surprise I was informed to web check in within 72 hours and 2 hours prior flight departure. When trying to select seat all are paid. Upon calling the airline they said that I have to pay else i won't be allowed to fly. I have paid rupees 7500 per person for one trip to Mumbai. I don't know who controls this. I have decided that I will never ever choose this flight.

### "11 hour trip instead of the original 2 hours"
Not Verified |  I had booked round trip direct flights with Go First from Pune to Lucknow with my wife and 2 year old. Close to the travel date, they cancelled both flights. Then I was forced to book indirect flights with them. They subsequently cancelled the return flight again. I begged them for a closest airport option (namely flying me to Mumbai). They declined that. Then I begged them to halt me in Delhi for a night at my own expense since long travel with a baby is difficult. They even declined that. Their refund option does not reflect the current market value of the tickets which was several times the original at that point. They prevailed at the end I was compelled to take an 11 hour trip instead of the original 2 hours that I bought with them.

### "It was the worst experience"
Not Verified |  Worst service. Never book Go first. Flight was cancelled 3 times and rescheduled connecting flight at 3 airports. Staff are not cooperative. Baggage was damaged. I personally do not recommend Go First. Traveling in Go First is time and energy consuming. It was the worst experience.

### "Worst airline in the world"
Worst airline in the world. I had bought round trip for my travel, with just 1 day left for me to board the plane I got a call from Go first that your scheduled flight has been cancelled and they will provide me with new schedule for the flight which had layover of more than 10 hours in night time. Tried to negotiate with them to arrange a better flight and was denied on the spot. Later when returning back from destination I wanted make some changes in my schedule so I contacted them again for that. Now the irony is that I had to pay charges for modifications as they only allow one time change in your schedule charges free. So the change that was made in the beginning due to their maintenance fault was counted as one time change and I had to pay extra money to get my schedule modified. Horrible experience!

### "In flight service good"
Go First changed the flight timing fortunately they advised us well in time and we’re helpful with rescheduling. Slightly disappointed that I could not book the emergency exits on line they were empty when I boarded and got them for free. In flight service good, punctuality good, on ground service good

### "Very poor service"
Not Verified | Lucknow to Kolkata. Very poor service. They always change your flight and just left a message. I can't remember a single time that I book my flight in Go First and they don't change it. I have a booking on 13 Apr 2022 in G8 163 which was a direct flight but they change it and just left a message. When I call back they just said sorry sir this flight is cancelled so we have to change your flight then they again change it which was a connection flight on same day. And tomorrow I'll travel on it but they again change it to another. And this time they don't tell me that this flight is cancelled they just told me that due to some reason we've change your flight. Worst airline in my point of view.

### "Customer service is pathetic"
I still wonder how these kind of airlines are operating in India. Never ever I had such a horrible experience with any of the airlines. Coming to my story, I have reserved 2 flights with them (HYD - BLR, GLR - MLE for Apr 11) on Mar 1st week and they sent out an email on Apr 9 saying my flight is cancelled because of operational issue. And for the BLR - MLE flight, they have rescheduled it as per their needs and convenience. The direct flight was changed to one stop flight. I had to buy tickets at a higher price from other airlines as I can't afford to miss my trip. This has caused me so much of financial stress and emotional trauma. These guys cancel your flights at the last minute quoting operational reasons. I tried calling them for about 8-10 times. When you call them, Call doesn't get connect and few representatives just hung up your call without helping you while other representatives put you on hold for infinite time without providing a resolution. Such a worst customer service that any business could afford. Customer service is pathetic. They did not even bother to compensate the customer because of the inconvenience that they have caused to the customer.

### "Very pathetic service"
Very poor service provider. Flight is being rescheduled without any information. Complete waste of time And energy. No assisting in airport also. As per govt guidelines web check in is mandatory before one hour of flight, but they are charging for seat selection. I bought the ticket them why would I pay extra for seat selection. I don’t want any preferred seat you can assign me any seat during web-check in. But i paid Rs 250. I tried for more than 22 times to reach to the customer care support, they kept me in hold and cut the call without connecting to any customer support executives. Very pathetic service, will not prefer travel by Go first nor suggest any one.

### "Just like a local bus service"
This is kind of a local bus service, which is flying. Changing the time of departure as per their needs and convenience. Just like a local bus service, we will not fly until all the seats are occupied. Third class service. Regretting my own decision by choosing Go First for my upcoming trip.

### "counter will be closed 60 minutes before"
I got to the check in counter 57 minutes before the flight departure and they could not board me. I agree that they had mentioned that the check in counter will be closed 60 minutes before the flight departure but 3 minutes is not not that big of a deal! I will never travel on this flight again.

### " had to go for another airline at the last moment"
My flight was From Kolkata to Pune (2hrs 35mins). Flight got cancelled before 12 hours and the second option given by the company was Kolkata - Delhi- Bangalore (12hrs). I mean seriously? I had to go for another airline at the last moment and had pay 10k more for the same journey.

### "Pathetic service and airline"
Pathetic service and airline. Firstly they cancel the flights as and when they like and more over their counter staff are so useless and slow that it takes ages just to have your check in luggage weighed and sent. Never again.

### "should be shut down completely
The direct flight was changed to one stop flight and no apologies no food for kids, and after that baggage were not even handled property. The baggages were Made to recheck in at Kochi and missed because of belt issues. 3 days and still counting, there is no info on where the bags are. These kind of airlines should be shut down completely.

### Go First customer review
Worst experience. Never ever experienced such thing with any airline. Two days prior I received a call regarding cancellation and then they gave me 3 options. Change of flight on same day which they denied citing reason that due to operational issues there is no flight from Dehradun to Delhi. Second change of dates which was also denied by saying that no flight is operating +/- 4 days from date of my flight. 3rd obviously cancellation which they insisted very much without considering my problems. They even did not bother to offer me partial cancellation as they first told that flight from Delhi to Surat is operating, but were not ready to provide me partial refund. Then when asked some of my friends, they shared me exact similar experience with this airline. Never ever take flight even if they are offering free of cost. Never trust such a cheater airline. Regulatory authority must take some steps to punish such serial offenders.

### "I wanted compensation from Go First"
I had booked a flight in Go First. They canceled the flight a few hours before travel. When I asked for an alternate they started behaving very rudely. I had to buy tickets at a higher price from other lines. I wanted compensation from Go First. I was trying to reach them via phone call, I called every phone number of Go First available, none of them responded. I had to pay extra money for staying in the hotel also.

### "Never, never, never again"
Not Verified |  Never, never, never again. Worst management with short notice cancellation. They cancelled the flight a few hours before the travel. I asked for an alternate date, which they didn't agree to. Finally after fighting so much, they gave me a next day connecting flight. I ended up with 16 hours of travel instead of 3.45 hrs. I will never take this flight again! Moreover I had to unload my entire baggage during transit and move from one terminal to another!

### "avoid Go First at any cost"
Go first is simply the most unreliable airline, they may cancel your flight even at the last day without any consent. Once cancelled they will give you 2 options either book their another flight, which as per the policy can be between 3-4 days from your flight time (it will be a connecting flight always) or just take the refund (Which will rip you off your money, because now you will be buying new tickets at a very high rates). Their customer support is even worst. They may show you cheaper flights in the beginning but what may come next is unpredictable. Please avoid Go First at any cost.

### "Worst airline with highest cancellation rate"
Worst airline with highest cancellation rate. They cancel flights two days before scheduled travel which causes us to buy tickets at a higher price from other lines. Will never repeat the same mistake of booking Go First.

### "cancelled our flights three times with very short notice"
I don’t usually write reviews but I want to spare someone else from a loss similar to what we experienced. Go First cancelled our flights three times with very short notice. We struggled to adjust our plans and reschedule the flights, only for them to be cancelled by Go First again. We had to pay hundreds of dollars in extra hotel fees. In the end we lost more money when we had to book our flights with a different airline. The airline was only willing to refund us 5,000INR when we paid 1,67,944INR for our tickets. Please save yourself from being robbed and stay away from this airline! They should not be in business and I do not expect that they will be for much longer.

### "Very bad experience"
Not Verified | Surat to Kolkata. Very poor bad service. There is no knowledge in time. If you want to waste your time then book Go First. Such a very poor, bad, service. Flight quality too low. Very bad experience.

### "internal processes needs a complete revamp"
I booked a ticket with Go First on the 18th of Feb, 2022 for a friend who was travelling the next day. I chose to book on the airline's website instead of a third party. The payment got immediately deducted from my account. But Go Air kept telling us that they haven't received any payment and didn't confirm the PNR. I waited with faith until the next day. In the meanwhile, I was trying to reach them via phone call, I called every phone number of Go First available, none of them responded. I contacted them via Twitter, but they kept giving me hopes that they are looking into the issue. Finally my friend reached the airport and checked at the sales/service counter at Delhi airport. They confirmed that they haven't received any payment and we have to book for the next available flight. Ultimately we booked with another airline, my friend waited for 12 long hours and travelled with another airline. I disputed the payment in my European bank, and since it was Europe, I received my money back after a month. Surprisingly, they deducted the same amount again the very same day, without me trying to do any payment online. Their payment page and internal processes needs a complete revamp.

### "unnecessarily troubling their travelers"
Not Verified |  I booked air tickets from Mumbai to Maldives & my further journey was booked 3 days after from Maldives to Brunei where I work & I had all the required documents including Visa, Travel approvals etc from Brunei & Maldives immigration which I showed to the Mumbai Checkin counter at 8:30am. However the counter crew did not issue me boarding passes stating that I do not have return tickets from Maldives & kept me waiting at the counter along with my kids standing for more than 1 hour. She did not even bothered to give a call to relevant authorities to get the resolution neither entertained my numerous requests. I even tried to get resolution by calling customer care number but even they couldn't resolve it. I have raised official complaint against such  uninformative and arrogant Ground staff on their complaint portal. I had to spend my 80$ in order to book return tickets and then cancel it just to get my boarding passes. The Maldives immigration did not even asked me about any return tickets. Its really shame on such airline for unnecessarily troubling their travelers.

### "Never taking this airline ever again"
Absolutely pathetic. I had booked a flight in this airline for the first time and I expected service as I have experienced from the other airlines before. I understand it is mandatory to web check-in before taking flight but the way these guys at go first make it requires you to pay extra for seat selection, which also can't be skipped if you are checking in the night before.. at the time I had tried, the only available seats cost upwards of 900 rupees. I found this really extortionate as I had booked my tickets well in advance to make an economical trip and it didn't make sense for me to end up paying more for it after all. When i arrived at the airport, i was about 40 mins before the scheduled flight take off. The lady at the counter refused to check me in because I hadn't web checked in. There were two companions travelling with me who happened to arrive at the airport just a little earlier than me and even they hadn't done web check-in and they were being denied boarding pass but after a long argument they were able to get the boarding passes for themselves and they were made to pay extra for that. But I was left behind even though there clearly was more than sufficient time to let me in as I didn't even need to check in any luggage. I just needed my boarding pass and i even offered to pay extra for it but they just blankly refused and escorted me out the airport on the level where i couldn't even ask a cab to come pick me as it was at the departure drop off at Chandigarh airport. Imagine my frustration here and all this while I was trying to figure out how to rejoin my travel companions. Researched flights on that day the prices were astronomical and absolutely unaffordable! My point at the end, i accept i reached a few minutes late at the airport, but the web-checkin process is designed to extort more money and it's absolutely unfair and no passenger should have to pay extra for the flight. They say first 100 seats are free. Like should this be a lucky draw? It's ridiculous! Never taking this airline ever again I'm appalled.

### "Definitely not recommended"
Unprofessional and rude ground staff· They changed the schedule rendering the entire journey useless, flight was delayed by almost 2 hours and the reason is wrong scheduling and and wrong planning by airline as they said, because of them many had to replan Their further journey, and even I missed my flight from Delhi to Chandigarh. They are so unprofessional, rude staff. Definitely not recommended.

### "Pathetic customer service"
Direct flight from Male to Bangalore cancelled and rerouted via Mumbai. This increased our flying time from 2 hours to 9 hours. Incorrectly informed by CSR that we need an RTPCR test, while I had checked on website that it was not needed. Despite my insistence that it was not needed, they said it was. So had to pay $225 to get the RTPCR tests for me and my family. Ultimately it turned out that it was not needed. Pathetic customer service. All they can say is 'sorry for the inconvenience, but we cannot do anything. Please email a complaint'. Even senior GoFirst officials at the airport say the same thing. No assistance to customers at airports. You are essentially left to fend for yourself. They charge for seats in addition to your ticket cost. This is not informed while booking tickets. So be wary of the 'cheap' tickets - there is a hidden cost.

### "unprofessional and rude ground staff"
Most unprofessional and rude ground staff. The flight has been rescheduled N number of times for which we had to completely replan our journey. I wouldn’t travel for free in this airline.

### "they changed the schedule rendering the entire journey useless"
Go First flight was booked through and through for a return journey and we had to cancel all the legs of the journey. Can't trust any of its flight remote or otherwise to fly on time on schedule hence I am going to opt out of booking on this flight going forth as there are better flights available at nearly the same or comparable prices as offered by Go First. The reschedule or managing the booking via call center is not that easy either but I believe same is the case probably with all airlines. Also we needed to know if we can continue at least on the second leg of the journey and not utilize the first leg on our own cost on same PNR. This query took a lot of digging from their end and finally they allowed it. After allowing it they changed the schedule rendering the entire journey useless.

### "Overall the flight was okay"
The fares for this particular sector were on the cheaper side and therefore as I had to visit Mumbai I had gone ahead with the booking for this flight however I was also not sure of what to expect with the airline as there were many complaints and also reviews stating that safety norms were not followed and also recently there was a deluge of flight cancellations with the airline. Closer to my travel journey my original flight got cancelled due to which they had allotted me an earlier flight which did cause a slight change in plans but not much. The online check in process was smooth however at the airport for the baggage drop the queues were quite long and the process was not as fast as it should have been. Also the boarding started well ahead of time which was a surprise as we had to rush towards the boarding gate as it was on final call. The flight departed on time and also arrived well ahead of time too. The crew were welcoming during the boarding and deplaning which was good however didn't get much chance to have the meals on board. Overall the flight was okay and the legroom was adequate enough for the duration of the flight. Although certain aspects like managing the check in queues could be handled better.

### "don't pay heed to customers preferences"
The airline services are pathetic, they don't pay heed to their customers preferences. Regular rescheduling if flights keep us on hooks. And no customer care services at the very least they can do. Changing flight status cost us extra charges.

### "Would never use again"
The worst airline in the industry. Rescheduled 2 times on the same day. And then delayed by 20 minutes in the middle of the night without prior information. The staff at the boarding counter were late, no phone calls are answered no email responses. Would never use again.

### "Never book Go First flight"
Flight canceled and require to book other airline by paying double charge. Never book Go First flight as they canceled their without any reason. It's worst and third class flight.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. I booked couple of weeks ago to get a good price. Just few days before the flight, I get a message that my flight is cancelled due to "issues beyond our control". I had to book an alternate flight, which is now more than double in cost. Go First made an automated call to inform me about cancellation, but nothing to refund my money immediately. I went to their website, and there is no option for refund even though it does say that my flight is cancelled. I tried the cancel option and they have the guts to charge a cancellation fee. I tried calling them and there was a 20 min waiting period, so I chose the option of them giving me a call back. They did call back, but there was no conversation (maybe due to some mobile network glitch), but they did not make another attempt to reach me. They cancelled the flight, I lose money, I have to figure out alternate options, and I now also have to find ways to reach them to plead for my refund. How ridiculous! Never ever am I booking GoFirst again.

### "flight cancel message just 5 days before"
Flight cancelled just 5 days before the journey. I received my flight cancel message just 5 days before. Flight change option is not good. Again I need to pay extra on flight change, which is not fair. Airlines are cheating common man on sudden cancellation & asking them to pay extra by flight change option

### "They are just fooling people"
I booked my flight 2 weeks in advance and just one week before the departure they have cancelled it for no reason. Now if i have to book another flight it cost me 4 times more. They are just fooling people so we end up paying extra for a different flight who is a sister company of theirs.

### "Needs huge improvement in customer service"
Not Verified |  Cancels flight at last minute saying operation reasons, the main reason being to cut down the cost if they do not get enough passengers. Booked flight tickets twice for Bangalore to Pune, each time one day before the departure date they notify that your flight is cancelled due to operational reasons. Don't know why others are not getting this many operational reasons as Go First. Not travelling with Go First next time even if I have to book costlier tickets with other airlines. If you cancel the tickets at least have guts to also refund convenience fees to customers, lost 1000 bucks on cancelling without any fault of mine. Needs huge improvement in customer service.

### "Need to improve overall"
Go First is budget airline but fare is higher than what they have provided us. For low budget airline I have paid double. Customer service is not available and even we are not be able to check flight status online. Web check in is not available for the same flight. Need to improve overall and keep fair as a budget airline.

### "Horrible customer service"
Not Verified | Horrible customer service. I book my ticket 1 week in advance they cancelled my flight without any reason and they never advice. I get to know while doing in line checking that my flight was cancel. I call the airline they told me they rebooked my ticket for previous flight and they were going to send all the details by email - that never happens. I call from 8am till 12 and they were not picking calls. Finally I talk with one guy and explain the situation. He asked me to wait in line but after waiting for 30 mins in call again the call disconnected. Even after that I tried several times. They never pick my call again.

### "cancelled it without giving any reason"
Not Verified | Go First is totally unprofessional. I booked a flight with them and even called 2 days prior to confirm if it is scheduled and not changed or cancelled and they confirmed it is on time. But at the last a few hours before the flight, they had cancelled it without giving any reason. After putting me on the next flight, that flight is also being postponed. So they are not reliable at all and try to combine passengers from different flights into one. They don't even provide any accomodation or meal even if the flight has been changed by more than 7 hours.

### "quarantine facility a nightmare"
The quarantine facility arranged by Go First Airlines turned to be a nightmare. They made a group of 6 people settle down in a single room and please note that all of us had mandatory quarantine on arrival. Sub standard hotel with no laundry and plumbing assistance. We had taps that didn't work and not even a soap.

### "customer service gives false promises"
One of worst experiences as they cancelled our flight twice within a span of 48 hrs. without giving any proper reason for cancelling it. We planned and booked our travel more than a month in advance because of medical reasons but these guys sent a message just a few days before the travel date stating the flight is cancelled. Their customer service gives false promises. Never ever book your tickets or plan your travel with this airline.

### "only thing decent thing was the customer support"
Not Verified |  The only thing decent about this airline experience was the customer support. The flight was cancelled two days after booking. The support staff was easy to reach and provided the necessary information promptly.

### "The crew was friendly"
My experience with Go first while coming back from Surat was amazing. I had a problem with the seat about which I had informed the cabin crew, they arranged for a different seat and made sure that my luggage gets relocated to the right seat. The crew was friendly and took great care of me by offering me water without me asking for it.

### "only paid seats are found"
I boarded Go First Flight G8 345 from COK to BOM on 2nd January 2022. I booked the ticket through Easemytrip.com on 23rd December 2021 and I got an SMS from GoFirst confirming my booking. Neither Go First nor travel agent informed me the requirement of doing web check in 24 hour prior to the time of journey. I tried to do web check in on the date of travel and only paid seats are found. I checked with the Customer Service and I am told that the free seats are available only till 24 hours prior to the time of journey. Hence I am forced to pay Rs. 250/- for the middle seat (8B), though free seats are available. When I reached at Airport, the passenger in front of me and behind me also faced the same issue, but they were misguided by the Customer Service personnel that they would get free seats from the check in counter. Nowhere we are informed that the additional charges would be levied and the booking is made subject to their terms and conditions.

### "They are so unreliable"
They are so unreliable and just cancel the flight and send a nonsensical communication with no instructions to reschedule or refund. Especially during peak travel season this flight can land you in trouble rather than to your Destination!

### "They don’t offer any free seats"
I had very bad experience with Go First airlines today. They are duping people on the name of paid seats. They don’t offer any free seats even they claim available in 24 hrs to departure. Also their customer care is pathetic and rude. I recommend people to avoid travelling through this airlines.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified | Don't ever book Go First flight, they are a big time scam and are into total cheat business. Booked ticket from Cochin to Bangalore and the return on Nov 2nd week for traveling on 30th November and return on 2nd Jan  so that we get the flight at lower cost. We booked it via make my trip. Within a week period prior to travel, at first the airlines people called saying that the "To" flight has been cancelled. We asked if the return flight cancelled or not. They confirmed that it will not be. And we had to book another flight at high price. On 27th dec, we got a message from the airlines again saying that the flight from 2nd Jan is also cancelled. Now we have to book another flight for the return. And on top of it we don't in hand get the full refund. The half portion of the while price goes as device charge from the agent. Don't ever opt for this flight. Worst experience ever.

### "Worst customer service"
Flight got canceled twice for the same day without any compensation. Worst customer service. Would not recommend. You're better off with any other airlines

### "4 flights got cancelled by Go First"
Our 4 flights got cancelled by Go First. They said it’s national emergency…what they mean national emergency - other flights were available on that day, government also not declared about it. We are going through a lot of financial and mental stress. We paid extra 40k for other flights booking.

### "Utterly incompetent and shady"
Not Verified | Had a flight booked with these idiots from Amritsar to Aizwal with a stopover at Delhi for 23rd. They sent me a text message stating that my Amritsar to Delhi flight was canceled. I ended up buying a one way ticket with indigo from Amritsar to Delhi. Reached Delhi to be told that the onward flight to Aizwal is also canceled. Now I'm stranded at Delhi Airport and had to buy another ticket to go back to Amritsar. Utterly incompetent and shady.

### "pay extra amount for the free seats"
Pathetic to pay extra amount for the free seats after already paying the huge amount for tickets. Just because we are doing web checkin before 2 hours, we were asked to pay extra amount as free seats were over. We did not face this kind of problem with any other airline. Why should we pay extra if we do not have any seat preference?

### "pay extra amount for the free seats"
It's pathetic to pay extra amount for the free seats after already paying the huge amount for tickets. Just because we are doing web checkin before 2 hours, we were asked to pay extra amount as free seats were over. We did not face this kind of problem with any other airline. Why should we pay extra if we do not have any seat preference? It's their duty to provide seats to us.

### "the flight has been cancelled"
I booked my flight from Surat to Bengaluru for 18th December 2021 and return on 27th December 2021. The flight was booked one month prior (17th November 2021). The previous day of journey i tried to do web check in and i was not able to do it. It was showing the flight got cancelled. But I did not get any notification about the cancellation. I tried calling their customer care and was told a waiting time of 10 minutes but didn't connect even after waiting for 20 minutes. Tried checking the flight status through customer care to which the reply was "no information is available on the flight". Tried installing their app to see what's happening but the app was crashing every time i tried to check the flight status. Note that i even got the itinerary mail saying the flight is confirmed on the previous day of journey. Finally on the day of journey, morning 9 am i again called customer care and finally connected to the executive who coldly replied that the flight has been cancelled. As per them, they tried calling me numerous times and sent multiple mails (none of them i received btw) notifying about the cancellation. Now they've told they'll give full refund for the cancellation which i dont think will happen so smoothly. These people are scamming customers with the tagline of cheapest flights. They are least bothered about the customers and the difficulties we go through to reschedule our journey. Finally i had to book another indigo flight to go ahead with my plans.

### "extremely rude behaviour"
The staff at check in was a trainee and could not find on the system that I had purchased extra baggage. Her mentor was extremely rude to me and did not bother checking the system. The call centre could see my purchase on their system but at the airport they refused to check, nor provide any written proof that they will not allow me the extra baggage. Staff told me to talk to call centre, call centre told me to talk to staff. They also lied about rules of whether I can record the conversation, I verified with security. After 3 hours of extremely rude behaviour from the staff I got a refund from their third supervisor.

### "worst domestic carriers in India"
Go First is undoubtedly one of the worst domestic carriers in India. My experience of travelling from Srinagar to Amritsar on 18 Dec-2021 was pathetic. My flight was scheduled at 13:30 PM but the flights was late and schedule timed 1400 pm but flight take off after 2:45 pm. I miss my online booked taxi. Very poor service by go first.

### "one of the worst domestic carriers"
Go First is undoubtedly one of the worst domestic carriers in India. My experience of travelling from Delhi to Hyderabad on 15-Dec-2021 was pathetic. My flight was scheduled at 7:20 AM but the Final call announcement was done by the airline at 6:30 AM itself. It made me skip my breakfast in the lounge and run all the way with my wife to the boarding gate. When asked, the uncourteous reason GoFirst quoted was that they had about 85% boarding done already hence they made the final call early. Ironically the flight departed 5 mins late from Delhi. On the other hand, these folks would have definitely denied boarding if a passenger would have been late even by a minute. The bus to the aircraft was completely full putting social distancing on joke. Even after passengers complained that the bus was overcrowded, the staff was least bothered and gave a deaf ear to it. While boarding the aircraft one of the ground staffs clearly misbehaved with folks who complained about the bus situation. They made people stand unnecessarily near the aircraft and allowed boarding only after a lot of noise.

### "they wouldn't let us board"
We had a bitter experience because they wouldn't let us board on our flight which was scheduled Monday at 9;15am and we were 2mins late for boarding which was at 8;30. While we already had online boarding pass, they could have at least inquired us about it and done but we had to pay extra 3.5k for each passenger and book our next flight again which was disappointing. It was not like the flight has left, there was still 45min time but we received no help from the people there. While returning back our flight was delayed for an hour and we had to wait. So while we are trying to be understanding they should be more helpful as well as because of that our whole plan has been spoiled and we had to rebook everywhere

### "Third class service"
Not Verified | Third class service. All flight on 8th December are delayed. No one give the proper explanation regarding delay. Crew members are hopeless. Book another airline for your journey. Travelling with go First is waste of time and waste of money

### "never travel again with this airline"
This is the first time I am travelling with gGo First and a day before they have rescheduled flight late by 2 hours and on the same before 1 hour of boarding they have again rescheduled it late by 1 hour. I have wasted three hours of mine with this airline. I will never travel again with this airline, neither I would suggest anyone. It will be late night 1 for reaching Hyderabad and transportation will also be charged high. Waste service.

### "cancelled both their flights"
I have booked both onward and return journey with Go first airlines well before 2 months advance. But just one day before the journey, they have cancelled both their flights. This has caused tremendous pressure on me.

### "Worst experience I ever had on an airline"
Not Verified |  Worst experience I ever had on an airline. No system of web check-in, its forcefully asking for additional charges. Inflight no attention paid to provide a water at least? I had corporate meal booking however none asked for the same. I wish to never travel with Go First in the future.

### "Never book a flight with this airline"
Not Verified |  The worst airline. Our flight was at 9pm and we arrived at 8.10. They didn't let us board even though we got a message from Go First that we need to arrive 25 minutes prior to the departure time. This is the message we received - "Dear Go First Flyer, your flight G8-404 from DEL to VNS shall be boarding from gate 32. Boarding gate closes 25 mins prior to departure time". Their way of speaking was very rude even though I was literally begging them to let us go this one time. Never book a flight with this airline.

### "the worst service I've seen so far"
I booked to fly a Go First flight for the first time and it was the worst experience ever. Never going to book again and I'll suggest the same to my friends. I'll explain the issue that I had: I booked the morning flight from Jaipur to Bangalore on 11th November and it got postponed. So now my flight was at 9.15pm and arrival time was 12am. Bangalore Airport is 40km away from the main city and lots of crimes has already been happened between. So I wanted to postpone the flight for some other day but sadly no-one picked my call. Waited on the line for more than 10 mins (3-4 times) and then asked for a callback. But didn't get any call. This is the worst service I've seen so far.

### "a very bad free seat"
Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. This was my first trip with Gofirst. I had booked my seats while booking the ticket itself. These were paid ones & were confirmed by the Gofirst team too. Later during web check-in, they randomly allotted me to a very bad free seat. I reached the airport counter for check-in in hopes of getting it corrected even though I didn't have any check-in bag. The agent there very rudely denied my word and said I hadn't paid for it. They wouldn't do anything. I called customer care later and they had the same attitude towards my problem.

### "didn’t let us board the flight"
By far one of the worst airlines in terms of staff, check in, bag drop and boarding. They didn’t let us board the flight by merely 2 minutes and this has been one of my worst experience ever. The flight is delayed and yet was asked to return. Will never recommend traveling by this airline ever again.

### "Very pathetic experience"
Very pathetic experience. I would never recommend anyone to travel wit hGo First flight. Flight was originally scheduled to depart from BLR at 14:00 hours and it was 1st rescheduled to depart at 16:20 hours and the information for which given well in advance which is quite manageable and 2nd time it was rescheduled to depart at 17:20 and the information of which provided on the date of journey i.e before 4 hrs and this quite difficult to manage but somehow we manage to adjust the inconvenience and again the flight was rescheduled 3rd time to depart at 18:30, the information of which is provided at 16:00 hours which is very late and very painful service from Go first.

### "one of the worst airlines to travel with"
This is one of the worst airlines to travel with. So here goes the story. My mother who was traveling alone from Lucknow to Pune, we had her bookings done, so the flight was from Lucknow to Bangalore then Bangalore to Pune. First they delayed the flight, then they cancelled the flight to Pune and for all the passengers who were traveling to Pune were asked to be dropped off in Mumbai without any facilities given to them for the Pune drop off. They just rudely said either you take this or walk out. My mother alone would be traveling from Mumbai without any security. We had our chatt puja start today, she had to start her fast from tomorrow for three days which makes it a four day fast because of this pathetic airlines services.

### "I won’t recommend it to anybody"
This is the worst airline. I won’t recommend it to anybody. It was compulsory to pay for the seat tickets even after paying for the entire ticket. The rules are written something else and they are stating something different. Customer value zero. almost all seats were showing unavailable and the ones available had to be paid. Never choose this airline

### " Very worst experience"
Not Verified |  Very worst experience in this flight. This is my first journey with Go First airline. First massage come before 2 days for rescheduling of flight by 1hr . And second message come on the day of flight rescheduled by 1hr 40min before 2hrs. Almost waiting time is 4hrs waste. I'll never book again in GoFirst. Very worst experience

### "Never book with this airline"
Not Verified |  Never book with this airline. I booked a flight with this airline for myself and family members in 3 months advance. Just 10 days prior to the departure, I received an email stating that the airline has canceled the flight. So I had to book that same route flight almost 3 times costlier than the previously booked one. Never Book flight with this airline.

### " Never traveling with the airline again"
Cheapest flight available. On-time reach. Every time flight is canceled and they inform 4-5 hours before via email or msg. So if are looking for something special on time do not choose this airline. They will give options to compensate with other flights with delayed options. This can cause a major issue in covid since many airports/states have different rules. I booked a flight ticket for 6 am around from Mumbai to Leh via Delhi. They sent me an email that this flight is canceled at 12am. Now, what am I supposed to do? I am already in Mumbai spent money on the hotel to stay in since I don't stay there. I called flight care they offered they have one flight at 3.30 am if you can make it we can book. LOL Being a single woman traveling at night is so safe you already aware. Anyway, I made to flight reached Leh safely! Now return story which is same with some more major issues. So being a new customer to this flight I wasn't aware that they are going to cancel every flight. They canceled my return flight as well. Which was from Leh to Mumbai via Delhi. I was informed by Leh/Delhi/Mumbai airports that the RT-PCR test will be done at the airport. Although I was fully vaccinated I believe the test was needed so I had no issues. Not being in Leh where network issues are on top. So after canceling my flight they offered me a flight from Leh to Mumbai via Srinagar. They didn't tell me that Srinagar won't allow you without the RT-PCR. Not their job I believe still no issue. Now I am at the airport at 5 in the morning looking for my boarding pass. Lady said no boarding pass since you don't have an RT-PCR test. I asked the airport system they said they will not be able to do so. because they do test only on arrival, not on departure. It's not their job. I am begging for Gofirst to provide me any flight even with the extra charge that can send me to Delhi at least. Because Delhi airport is best. They do pcr and let you go. Plus no network issue. So after 4 hours of a hopeless situation, I got a flight for the next day to Delhi. Never traveling with the airline again.

### "effulgent with her efforts"
Miss Priyanka was effulgent with her efforts to keep the passengers well taken care of. Ready to assist, was a delight to receive the way she added to our experience of Go First flight, as my 12 year old son Soham, complimented too. She's a major value addition to your crew & company. I wish her all the the best in her future career. Flight was on time, very comfortable.

### "Customer care team is another hell"
My baggage is struck in Goa and not at all responding for anything. Customer care team is another hell, where they wont pick up the calls. What a irresponsible airline. Funny thing is when i tried to give the feedback on their website, the website is also not working yet. Not sure if they are running the airlines or anything else.

### "the service on board wasn't up to the mark"
This is in regards to the Go Air flight G81531 that me and my husband boarded from New Delhi to Maldives on 12th of Sep, 2021. I want to share my awful experiences that I had that day. Firstly the flight was so jam-packed that the waiting area was densely crowded and during these times where Covid is out there to kill everyone. The same thing continued when the boarding was announced. Everyone rushed to be the first to get on the plane and again the staff handling the boarding seemed so okay with it. People weren't asked to be in any queue or anything. And again the boarding was done in a rush. Secondly, since every middle seat in the flight was booked, a PPE kit which should have been provided wasn't given to anyone. This being said, we could clearly see the staff members in possession of those PPE kits but for some unknown reasons, they didn't provide those kits to anyone and moreover, didn't stop anyone who hadn't put on the PPE kit. It seemed like the airline is hell bent on "lives cutting" rather than "cost cutting. Thirdly, the service on board wasn't up to the mark. Usually every flight has the service where they at least provide you water to drink. But here we couldn't see anyone coming up to us with anything. When we asked for water, it took them ages to get back to us. Lastly, to my most surprise, something happened which I have never experienced before. Be it any airlines, the pilot makes an announcement much before the landing and gives a brief pitch about the time that's remaining for the touch down, weather/temperature of the destination and stuff like that. But here no announcement as such was done and the pilot just gave a one liner, "we are about to land at the Maldives international airport. Hope you guys had a great experience. Clearly we didn't have a great experience! And just when the plane landed, everyone again rushed to deboard the flight. The flight attendants didn't seem bothered by this. Be it Covid times or pre covid times, attendants always ask the people on board to maintain patience and decorum. Nothing as such happened. Ultimately, we managed to come out of the plane. And all we could think of was when we would get ourselves tested for Covid. We were so sure that we would have gotten infected because of this poorly managed flight service throughout. Luckily we were okay but it clearly was a terrible experience for me and my husband. If the service of Go Air has degraded to such levels I will never ever board any its flight again and will surely never recommend it to anyone.

### "the seats needs to be pre-booked"
Traveled alone with my four months old daughter from Mumbai to Sharjah on 15th September 2021. Since I was traveling alone with an infant, i was trying to plan things ahead of time so called their customer support a few times just to confirm the seat number where I will get extra leg room (Extra leg room seat or the seat right after a wall is always preferred while traveling with kids as it is spacious and you can get up from the seat without disturbing co passengers). On multiple calls, I was always told that seat 3A is having extra leg room, in short row 3 is extra legroom. When requested to pre allot the seat, I was told that booking a seat in advance is a paid service. (I'm talking about reserving a seat and not booking the flight ticket) I paid the seat fees 1100 INR. Upon boarding the flight I was surprised to look at the seat as it was a very ordinary seat without much legroom. I double checked and it was 3A. I got worried thinking how am I going to adjust there with my infant. I sat there, I waited for all the passengers to board. Front two rows were empty so out of 12 seats only one passenger was seating, remaining 11 seats were vacant. Once the boarding was finished, I called the crew member told her that I have paid for the extra leg room seat and requested if they can change my seat and let me seat at one of those empty seat. The lady said it's not in her hand and sent someone else to me. I told the same story to another who came to me, He listened to me and said it's not in his hands the seats needs to be pre-booked, they are paid seats etc. and said he will get back to me. He never came back. My co passengers supported me and requested them to shift me at one of those seats but they took no action. Many of their services are paid like seat reservation or even you can't carry two check in bags per person only one check in bag is allowed. They charge you extra for extra bag. The ground staff was supportive at Mumbai airport. But for crew and their customer support I give zero.

### "The flight got delayed"
I was hesitant to book this worthless GoAir flight as I had bad past experience of flight cancellations and delays. But I booked because it was going to departure 2.5 hours after I received the unfortunate news. This time also go first didn't disappoint. The flight got delayed and I reached my destination late.

### "very bad to play with customers"
I have made a booking of flight ticket from go air for 8th sep from Bangalore to Pune. however due to personal reasons I have rescheduled the flight to 7th September by paying 3350 INR. The problem is money got deducted first time when I was doing it from GoAir website using gpay. I have called up GoAir customer care and they told me that the deducted money will be credited back to my account. They requested me to pay one more time. This time I have paid it using my CITI credit card. this time the rescheduling completed. it is been more than 10 days and not received any refund of 3,350 yet. I have confirmed from HDFC bank and they told bank has already processed the amount and they wont be able to refund but airline has to do it. I have been calling the airline customer care for last 10 days and emailed them, no response given to email and no proper answer for calls. This is very bad to play with customers.

### "convert direct flight to indirect"
Not Verified |  This airline sucks. They convert direct flight to indirect and when call their support team, they will say we have sent mail a day back and keep on saying sorry 10 times. They don't have courtesy to even offer a proper apologies and complete information on it just sorry.

### "not refunding my money"
I paid 13000 for extra baggage, now due to COVID all my flights got canceled and I had to cancel my Goair flight as well. Agent who helped me to cancel my check in and baggage told me that I will get my baggage money return in 30 days. Now it’s been over a month and now they are telling me about all their policy and not refunding my money. Such a terrible customer service.

### "Social distancing maintained"
Not Verified |  My flight was good, but was rescheduled by 5 hours. I flew during the pandemic. Food - free water given due to government restrictions. Pros - Attentive cabin crew. Safety gear given (mask, ppe kit, face shield, hand sanitizer). Received notification of rescheduled flight 1 day before. On time arrival. Social distancing maintained. Cons - Ground staff were not up to the mark (just 1). Customer service didn't call us back.
