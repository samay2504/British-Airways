### "WIFI was pretty fast"
Not Verified |  Istanbul to Tripoli. This airlines is decent, and I was served particularly well. The food and beverages were great and the in flight entertainment contained a lot of movies to watch. Also the WIFI was pretty fast and effective.

### "not received check-in luggage"
I travelled from Doha to Libya via Tunis as Transit. My check in baggage reached from Qatar to Tunis I have requested help desk to transfer my luggage to Tripoli and I was told will do but not transferred at the time of flying. I have all my dresses with that baggage so request the authority to look in this matter and do needful to transfer my luggage. My friends also not received check-in luggage since more than 5 months

TIP-ATH. A very comfortable flight on leather seats on new CRJ-900. Breakfast well served with a generous portion. Service went smoothly and efficiently crew were English speaking. Plane interior clean. Flight left on time and seemingly no worries about cent for cent baggage weight checking. All in all a very pleasant experience.

TIP-BEN on a nearly new Canadair regional jet with leather seats and decent pitch. Very happy with the short flight. New terminals are being built at both ends - sorely needed. Otherwise would fly them again

### Libyan Airlines customer review
TIP-BEN original flight cancelled and finally took off nearly 6 hours later than originally planned. CRJ900 very good with comfy seats. Trolley Service was hot or cold non-alcoholic drinks and a small cake/biscuit. Flying time just over 1 hour. Had to identify luggage on the tarmac prior to boarding the aircraft. Some of the other aircraft did not look quite so modern it has to be said.

Manchester - Tripoli. Late leaving Manchester due out at 12.45 and eventually left at around 2pm. Smallish plane two seats either side of the aisle but hardly anyone on board so plenty of room. Plane was new and the experience was fine cabin crew were helpful and friendly and food was good. No video screens or music so take your own or a book. Will be using this route again.

Madrid to Tripoli CRJ900. No delays at Check-in however aircraft was parked some distance from the terminal and we had to wait for some time on a bus before a 5 minute journey to the plane. The plane was new-looking if a little small. Not full - I had a row of two seats to myself. The cabin crew were serious-looking but quite friendly. After take-off juices and a hot meal of smoked salmon and vegetables was served - delicious. No alcohol as it's illegal in Libya. Arrival in Tripoli hassle-free. The customs guys in Tripoli airport are another story.

I had three flights with Libyan Airlines in three days - Tripoli to Tunis return then Tripoli to Malta. No problem regarding check in everything fine and staff were friendly and helpful. My complaint is about the price which I think was ridiculous - Tripoli to Tunis return LD332 and its only one hour flight : Tripoli- Malta cost me LD 275.

Manchester to Tripoli Airbus A320. Plane was a little old and tired looking. Only 15 passengers on board and I was the only one in Business Class. Seats were OK food was fine. The flight took off on time and arrived in Tripoli on time. Based on costs and timings this was very good value compared to British Airways.

TUN-TIP. Check-in at Tunis was efficient and staff generally friendly. Boarding at the gate was chaotic. While on the runway the plastic emergency exit covering came off. The pilot came and put it back on. Plane then proceeded with take-off. The food was standard and staff friendliness on board ok although only with limited English skills. Onboard announcements were in Arabic only. The interior was worn emergency cards in seat pockets were still from the former owner of the plane a defunct French airline.

Manchester to Tripoli. The ticket said departure was 11.45am. At check-in time there was no check-in open and it transpired that the plane was scheduled to leave at 4pm - so check-in wouldn't be open for another 3 hours. In the end the plane left at 5.25pm. So pre-flying was an absolute nightmare. However once on board things were much better. Nice food and drink (no alcohol unfortunately) and the cabin crew attentive and friendly. But unfortunately it took ages for the bags to appear once we arrived in Tripoli. So to sum up Libyan Arab Airlines seem to be good in the air. Not so good on the ground.

Tripoli to Manchester. The plane took off an hour late - so not a great start. But once onboard there were no problems. Staff friendly food was ok - a bit too many sweets and the seats were comfortable enough. All in all an ok experience. It's by far the cheapest option to get to Manchester so I'll probably be using it again in the future.

Tripoli to Bengazi. A one hour flight that turned into a dreadful 4 hour experience. 1.5 hours late sitting inside the domestic terminal with no reason whatsoever. Bussed to the plane which was a 727-200 that looks like a dead bird from the outside and was very hot from the inside. Torn and non adjustable seats tables kept opening and no seat number assigned to passengers - serve yourself! Before take off the captain explained why the AC was not working well the APU on the aircraft was not working. Long story short - I am a very frequent flyer but flying on that old 722 gave me the creeps!

11 Oct 05 Tripoli-Tunis Libyan Arab Airlines There are two terminals in Tripoli one domestic and the other international about 20Km and $20 apart. This one and-a-bit hour flight was due to leave at 1430. Be aware that when you fly on Libyan Arab Airlines you will be bussed to a very distressed 30 year old 727-200. We boarded the plane only half an hour late because of a “security” agent in dark glasses and an Armani- type suit (jacket draped over the shoulders) who laboriously checked documents of all passengers on the 40 degree tarmac. The interior of the plane was so hot probably 50 degrees) that the older passengers were dropping like flies which further delayed the departure by a couple of hours. Sitting beside me fanning himself at high speed (the interior was now like 120 large beserk butterflies) was a flight engineer for LN who explained that there were no spare parts for the Auxiliary Power Unit that provides the AC so that’s why it was hot. I thought that this was not the moment to ask if there could be similar spares shortages for the main engines. People perked up above 10000 feet when they recovered and the cabin crew were not as aggressive as they were on the ground. Your heart goes out to these folks who are on these planes it’s both unpleasant and dangerous work. The alternative to taking Libyan Arab Airlines to Tunis is a 12 hour bus ride.
