### "hey represent Skyteam very badly"
I will never consider it again. Three of us traveled from Buenos Aires to Rio. I paid extra to fly Premium (Business) to benefit from check-in to baggage claim at the destination. At check-in the lady asked me if I knew that I had to pay for the suitcase. I told her we were flying Premium and I was also a Skyteam Elite Plus member (free additional suitcases) and the suitcase was only 21kg. On international flights 23kg is allowed (according to the homepage and ticket). She said that she would make an exception. We have access to the lounge and through my Elite Plus status with Skyteam either way. Only the lounge is in the terminal between arrival and departure. So it's outside. Complete nonsense, because a lounge belongs after security and passport control, because you never know how long you have and can't leave the lounge 10 minutes before boarding like everywhere else. They really don't serve wine in business class. Argentina, a wine producer? The “food” was a light sandwich wrapped in plastic. They simply moved one of the backpacks in business class to put a suitcase from economy class in the upper compartment. We pay more to have more comfort and peace and quiet. The crew was arrogant or/and in a bad mood, again playing up the whole service. The seats were dusty/dirty. The price was expensive (we flew with other companies in a better class and had top service there) Never again - not recommended. They represent Skyteam very badly.

### “no customer service whatsoever”
I made a simple mistake of putting a wrong date whilst I was paying and requested a refund within an hour when I realised it, they refuse to reimburse even a bit of my money and telling me that if I bought the ticket from the UK the 24 hr full refund does not apply, not helpful, not contactable and I am out of pocket. These people are not being held accountable and not reliable, I can only kick my own self and will try my best to escalate as I have all the emails. Unbelievable and sad and no customer service whatsoever.

### "not offer even a glass of water"
Not Verified |  This review is in regards to the cabin crew for our flight AR 1383 on August 20, 2024 from Montevideo to Buenos Aires. They always offer beverages and sandwiches or muffins in Premium Class The staff closed the curtain and started to eat and drink. They did not offer even a glass of water. The got the sandwiches that were supposed to be offered to u.

### "didn’t want to reimburse my expenses"
Terrible customer service Aerolineas Argentina has the worst customer service. On my flight from Brazil (Rio) to Argentina (El Calafate) they lost my luggage. Now I understand this can happen. At first, they worked very hard to find it, but it took them almost 3 days to find my luggage and send it to my hotel. In the meantime, I had some excursions planned and needed to purchase some basic clothing which was all in my luggage. During the process of filling in all the forms for getting my luggage back they told me all expenses I had to make will be reimbursed. So, when I got home after my vacation, I filled in a online form with all the details they provided me. After a month or so they just sent me an email (to which you cannot reply) that my luggage was delivered, and they didn’t want to reimburse my expenses. There is no phone number you can call or email address you can mail. Only one with a Spanish speaking computer. No real person to get in touch with. Again. I understand that sometimes mistakes are made, and luggage will get lost. But not providing any service and support to get my expenses back is in my opinion not done and not a SkyTeam member worthy.

### "trying to get my money back"
On June 7, I paid E-Dreams U$S 1,787.47 x Aerolíneas Argentinas ticket + E-Dreams commission U$S 166.53. The ticket was JFK-AEP-MVD with return MVD-AEP-JFK. A few months ago we were contacted by E-Dreams saying that this flight was not being made, and that they offered JFK-EZE-AEP-MVD with return MVD-AEP-EZE-JFK. We were presented with the option of a 100% refund for changing flights, we opted for a refund. At the same time, the same thing happened to a second person who was traveling the same route, but he made his purchase through Expedia, and they refunded his money within 72 hours. Until today, 12/14/23, I am trying to get my money back, I have called E-Dreams countless times, they say that Aerolíneas Argentinas does not answer their emails or calls. For my part, I have tried to call Aerolíneas Argentinas and they do not answer any phone. To add more, my wife went to the Aerolíneas Argentinas offices here in Montevideo, and they told her that she couldn't do anything, I went too and the same thing happened to me. Aerolíneas Argentinas fails to comply with the flight and does not say how to proceed or facilitate a refund, they pass the blame on to E-Dreams.

### “Pleasant experience on all flights”
Flew AR on various segments in November - Rio de Janeiro (GIG) to Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires - Puerto Madryn (r/t) and Buenos Aires - Barilcohe (r/t), using both AEP and EZE in Buenos Aires. Pleasant experience on all flights. All flights departed on time, boarding process was well organized, crews were courteous, and complimentary drinks and a snack were served in economy. No issues with checked luggage. Would certainly fly them again.

### "I was really pleasantly surprised"
Not Verified |  Flying from AEP to IGU in Prem Economy. I was nervous about what to expect on Aerolineas I have to say that I was really pleasantly surprised (once we got on the plane). Check in at Business was a breeze. Security and Boarding was polite chaos. They had two flights going to two locations boarding at the same gate at the same time. However the premium economy was great, simple but worth the extra. The seats were comfortable and clean (think that armchair type of seats you use to get in business class). Service on this flight was friendly (on others it was non-existant). They provided a sandwich and soft drinks. The best thing though is on every Aerolineas flight my bags were on the carousel as I arrived there. They have some amazing expedited system to get premium bags off which is great.

### "do not recommend choosing this airline"
Not Verified |  Our recent trip with Aerolineas Argentinas on the 6th, 7th and 11th was a deeply disappointing experience. Both on the way there and on the way back, we faced a series of problems that negatively affected our trip. On the way out, our scheduled flight to Buenos Aires from Guarulhos was scheduled to take off at 10:50 am. However, we were abruptly informed of a delay with no clear guidance on how to proceed. During the agonizing wait time, we received conflicting information about departure times, and promises of meal vouchers were not fulfilled on time. This forced us to spend our own money on food. To make matters worse, our flight was ultimately cancelled, and we faced difficulties in reaching Aerolineas employees for clear information. After an exhausting wait, we finally received a voucher for a hotel. However, the instructions for finding the bus to the hotel were confusing, and company staff seemed to be disrespectful of our situation. Upon arriving at the hotel, we discovered that Aerolineas Argentinas had only paid for the outward ticket, leaving us with unexpected expenses for the return to the airport. The following night, we faced another long queue at the airport and missed our connection to El Calafate, without any hotel paid for by the company. We were instructed to request accommodation at a hotel in Buenos Aires, but were only given a voucher for breakfast at the airport. This resulted in an extra 10 hours of waiting at the airport, putting a damper on our planned tour. On the return trip, we faced an additional problem, as the stopover in Córdoba was not informed on the ticket, resulting in a 1-hour delay upon arrival in São Paulo. In short, our experience with Aerolineas Argentinas was highly unsatisfactory due to delays, cancellations, lack of clear communication and inadequate support from the company. We do not recommend choosing this airline for future travel. Nossa recente viagem com a Aerolineas Argentinas nos dias 6, 7 e 11 foi uma experiência profundamente decepcionante. Tanto na ida quanto na volta, enfrentamos uma série de problemas que afetaram negativamente nossa viagem. Na ida, nosso voo programado para Buenos Aires a partir de Guarulhos estava marcado para decolar às 10h50. No entanto, fomos informados abruptamente de um atraso sem orientações claras sobre como proceder. Durante o tempo de espera angustiante, recebemos informações conflitantes sobre o horário de partida, e promessas de vouchers para refeições não foram cumpridas a tempo. Isso nos obrigou a gastar nosso próprio dinheiro para alimentação. Para piorar, nosso voo foi finalmente cancelado, e enfrentamos dificuldades para encontrar funcionários da Aerolineas para obter informações claras. Depois de uma espera exaustiva, finalmente recebemos um voucher para um hotel. No entanto, as instruções para encontrar o ônibus para o hotel foram confusas, e funcionários da companhia pareciam desrespeitar nossa situação. Ao chegar ao hotel, descobrimos que a Aerolineas Argentinas havia pago apenas a passagem de ida, deixando-nos com despesas inesperadas para a volta ao aeroporto. Na noite seguinte, enfrentamos outra fila longa no aeroporto e perdemos nossa conexão para El Calafate, sem nenhum hotel pago pela companhia. Fomos instruídos a solicitar alocação em um hotel em Buenos Aires, mas recebemos apenas um voucher para café da manhã no aeroporto. Isso resultou em 10 horas extras de espera no aeroporto, prejudicando nosso passeio planejado. Na viagem de volta, enfrentamos um problema adicional, já que a escala em Córdoba não estava informada na passagem, resultando em um atraso de 1 hora na chegada a São Paulo. Resumindo, nossa experiência com a Aerolineas Argentinas foi altamente insatisfatória devido a atrasos, cancelamentos, falta de comunicação clara e apoio inadequado da companhia. Não recomendamos a escolha desta companhia aérea para futuras viagens.

### “incredible good seat pitch”
An hour delay, no apologies nor explanations. Quite some occasional turbulences, again no word from the cockpit. What compensated the whole flight was the incredible good seat pitch and the round of drinks and a cookie (definitely much better than what some self-proclaimed full-service airlines deliver).

### "do not lose your money with them"
Not Verified |  Do Not Fly! They will take your money and not refund you. They moved my flight up two hours but sent me an email saying that it was changed to the next day. I called the next day to confirm and they said that it was an error but I would have to still pay for a new flight because I missed the original one that they messed up on. Please please please do not lose your money with them.

### "lousy food in bad condition"
Not Verified | It was an international flight and I received lousy food in bad condition. It's unbelievable that they don't offer a minimum service when the tickets are so expensive. Never again!

### "Non-existent catering"
Not Verified |  Non-existent catering, lousy coffee, a glass of water in plastic elements, non-existent entertainment, and aircraft without USB chargers. The chaotic checkin, and staff with rude appearances. El catering inexistente, un cafe malísimo, un vaso de agua en elementos de plástico, entretenimiento inexistente, y las aeronaves sin cargadores de USB. El chekin caotico, y personal con unas apariencias maleducados

### "they tend to leave on time or early"
One of the best things about AR is that they tend (in my experience on 3 flights) to leave on time or early. Boarding by zones is usually enforced and it works; boarding starts early. Staff on board seem tired, are never well-groomed and generally bored. Friends / other staff seem to be upgraded to Business class regularly on board. Catering is very basic usually - example: "Breakfast" flight of 3.5 hours, leaving at 05:10 served a cup of still water and a small "health" bar. No options like other menu for sale items. Crew disappeared after service. Cabin baggage seems to have no item number control but is weighed rigorously. Free checked baggage allowance is 15kg, unlike most other carriers throughout the world, and carry-on is 8kg. This can be a trap for international guests who usually travel with around 23kg checked baggage allowance. Overweight is charged for on the spot.

### "still haven't received my money"
Worst experience with an airline, ever! Completed booking, completed payment with my bank and got forwarded back to a website that said "error". No confirmation, no tickets received but the money was gone. Called with customer service and got disconnected a total of 6 times while being on hold. When I finally did speak to someone, she informed me there was a booking with reservation number but something on their side went wrong with the payment. She gave me the reservation number and on their website I could find my flight details. But still no tickets. I had to e-mail the ventasonline department who would be able to provide me the tickets. The communication with ventasonline was pointless. They first told me my booking didn't exist and I should book a new flight. I showed them a print screen of my bank payment and the booking with the reservation number and then it all of a sudden did exist, they would write me back about a solution for the money or tickets but they never did. Called with customer service again and they would all say something different or that I had to call back in an hour so they would know more. Did that a total of 4 times when I just lost my patience and the only thing they told me I could do was write an official complaint. As a reply, I received an automated e-mail telling me to contact customer service, so basically super pointless and you're just going around in circles with no one knowing how to help you get either your money back OR give me the damned flight tickets. I always book direct with an airline so that this stuff doesn't happen, but Aerolineas Argentinas apparently doesn't care about their clients and actual customer service. It has been 3 weeks now since booking and still haven't received my money. They tried to make me book a new ticket before receiving the money back but of course I don't have any trust with them anymore so booked with another airline (Air France) and everything went fine. This was my first experience with Aerolineas Argentina and for sure my last. Will avoid flying with them at all costs. By the way, because I paid with credit card my money is safe. I got confirmation from my bank and credit card provider that I was in my right and would receive money back via them. But it's really just pathetic that it has to go like that.

### "I am disgusted and we will never fly this airline again"
After paying over $6K for two business class seats for our honeymoon, we were first told we weren’t able to sit together and that it was our fault because we could have purchased seats ahead of time, even though we could not see anything via the Delta or AA websites that would allow us to change our seats or check in online (also what? We paid business so you mean to tell me there’s even more of a price for seat choice even when you can’t see it online?) Then after an hour and a half wait at the passport control security line (no one seemed to be working at all) an hour and a half delay they had flagged my wife’s boarding pass and made her - a business customer - wait until the entire plane boarded ahead of her before they would let her on the flight. She got on the plane crying. Then the flight attendant was rude about it. I am disgusted and we will never fly this airline again. It’s okay if you’d like to check a passenger again but when they pay for priority and you board the entire plane before them? You are disgraceful. You ruined the last day of our honeymoon and we are disgusted with Delta for connecting us with this airline.

### "no refund has been paid after 5 months"
On 10 August 2022 we purchased refundable return airline tickets with Aerolineas Argentinas from Cordoba to Ushuaia the port of embarkation for a December Antarctic cruise, returning Ushuaia to El Calafate. Two weeks later the expedition company cancelled our cruise citing ship delays. We immediately cancelled our AA flight reservations. The airline confirmed a refund was due under the fare conditions and would be paid within 120 days in December 2022. After hours of follow-up effort and numerous late night communications via Messenger and Translation apps with service agents in South America and their service centre in Florida USA, no refund has been paid after 5 months. How can this airline sell, and charge extra for flexible/refundable tickets if they have no intention of honoring their fare conditions?

### "the worst airline I have ever flown"
Not Verified |  After having traveled NYC to Buenos Aires and two other flights to Ushuaia and back to Buenos Aires, I can say that this is the worst airline I have ever flown. There was no way to contact them; I tried, and every time the phone disconnected. The trip to Buenos Aires was without any Wi-Fi, entertainment system, or way to recharge our devices. The staff had a distinct hands-off attitude and any requests were ignored. I was told they would reboot the entertainment system. Two hours later, they informed me that they still hadn't done this and never came back with further information. The staff were unfriendly and uncaring. I will not be using this company in the future.

### "aircraft in very good condition"
Check in was flawless, aircraft in very good condition but rather small for a three hour red eye flight; on other positive aspect, flight was scheduled for 0150 am but departed around 50 min ahead of time, which is not always desirable specially when People are meeting you at destination airport But what the heck, would you rather be late?

### "my last time flying them"
I was flying red eye from Bogota to Montevideo with a connection in Buenos Aires and my flight was delayed over 5 hours. This caused me to sleep at the airport and have my connection rescheduled so that I not only arrive late at night to where I cannot check in to my reservation and more importantly I miss out on a valuable day of vacation. There was no staff at the airport when I arrived at the gate or anywhere beyond the checkpoint. And no one would show until 2.45am, which is 7 hours after I arrived. No one to help with their mistake. When staff did arrive I asked for any form of accommodation. Sleeping at airport? Nothing. An earlier connection? Nothing. Cancelation (I unfortunately have another couple flights with this airline) since now I only have 2 days in Montevideo? Nothing. Money or points? Nothing. There’s nothing they can do but pass me off to the next stop. This is my first and lasting impression with them and after my trip it will be my last time flying them.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Not Verified |  On a recent trip to Argentina, I flew with Aerolineas Argentinas several times on domestic trips. I was pleasantly surprised. The aircrafts were well maintained and all flights were on time.

### "service was generally unfriendly"
Absolutely disgraceful. The airline made us wait 2.5 hours in Madrid to issue our boarding passes. There is no business lounge. The service was generally unfriendly. Everything was an effort. No flat bed. The food came on a trolley and was most unappetizing. No menu printed and only two options. Poor presentation. When we arrived in Buenos Aires, we had to wait 1.25 hours with no announcement or explanation for our luggage. Our luggage was wet and clothes in luggage also wet.

### "I will avoid this airline at all costs"
A scheduling disaster. Five flights booked, all five were rescheduled. Not only that, but the rescheduling included connections that didn’t make sense anymore: first leg landing after the second leg departs, and with no further options during that day. First, they changed the first flight of five, and only offered to rebook that one for free (even though it affected the following 4) so I had to pay for the change of the following four flights myself. Then, as the dates approached they changed (multiple times) the remaining four flights, up to the point that my last flight is to a completely different city. I will avoid this airline at all costs whenever I have a choice. An embarrassment and a scam.

### "Awful customer service!"
Awful customer service! I booked 5 flights with the airline. 1) Customer Service not responsive: I had to miss my 4th flight due to an unexpected situation. The airline allows change/cancellation if it is >1.30hour prior to the flight time - I have tried contacting the airline by calling and WhatsApp, no replies - I had no choice but to forego this booking and purchase a new ticket from a different airline. The WhatsApp reply came 12 hours later and did not even read the chat above. 2) Unclear policies - As a result of missing my 4th flight, the airline automatically removed my 5th flight from the system - The airline did not allow me to check in and I had wasted 1 extra hour in talking to the sales office. The sales office wouldn't issue a new ticket for me as it is "impossible" to fly today now, the earliest flight available is in 2 days which is unacceptable. 3) Awful service from staff - I complained "how am I supposed to know? that they would remove my 5th flight because I missed my 4th one (they are 1.5 days apart), the staff responded "now you know" - The staff even scolded me for not arriving to the airport earlier.

### "told us we would have to wait 8 hours"
Not Verified |  Having booked flight over a month in advance, they over sold the flight. Did not notify us until we were at the check in counter, 90min before the flight. Basically told us we would have to wait 8 hours and hopefully get the next flight. If you are thinking of booking with this airline please reconsider. For your own peace of mind. Customer service is not in their intentions, only taking your money.

### "I have not received a penny"
Absolute disgrace. By far the most sketchy, unprofessional airline I ever dealt with. Flights canceled due to Covid. Argentinean Airlines have disconnected all phones and no one ever replies on WhatsApp. I mean using a free app to communicate with customers - all you need to know about their level. I have received one reply saying that they have reimbursed me on November 30th. It's February and it's clear that that's a lie - I have not received a penny. By the way, I have paid for flexible ticket, so it was refundable regardless of the Covid situation.

### "still no reimbursement or even reply"
By far the worst customer service I have ever experienced (basically there is none). One of these airlines where things are ok as long as there is no issue, otherwise you are in for a treat. Flight cancelled in April (no reason provided but covid would be the logical guess) and still no reimbursement or even reply to my many requests over the last 8 months. There is no number to contact the company, they only give you a WhatsApp number to call (no one answers) or ask you to do so on Facebook (and again they do not reply).

### "nothing approached business standards"
Buenos Aires to New York. My first and last international flight with this airline. Literally nothing about our experience approached business class standards for a full-service airline: inattentive and rude flight attendants who were absent for most of the 11-hour trip and routinely ignored call buttons; no preflight drinks or even water or hand towels; I had to ask for an amenity kit as the crew forgot to hand them out; they banned the use of the front lavatory claiming it was "company policy" and did not clean the two others very often. The onboard entertainment was non-existent and no one was watching any of the few movies offered. It gets even worse: the meal service was the worst I've ever had in business or first class on any airline. It came not on a plate but in an aluminium foil-wrapped tin container and was inedible. Our flight departed at 11:30 pm and they started meal service two hours later, which is unacceptable for passengers who want to eat and go to sleep. I'm a Diamond Medallion with Delta, so at least I got the miles, but Skyteam needs to seriously rethink having this airline as part of its alliance.

### "our tickets were cancelled"
Buenos Aires to Mendoza. We had booked several flights with Aerolineas Argentinas but me missed the first one due to a cancelled flight to Argentina (not Aerolineas Argentinas). So we missed that flight but bought a new ticket to our first destination. Did not think much of it until we were at the airport for our next destination. We were informed that since we missed the first flight, all our tickets were cancelled. To avoid this we could pay a fees for no-show and other penalties for a total of USD 688 per person. That is more then the tickets cost! There was no email that informed of this. The interest of ground staff to resolve this was zero. it more felt like extortion. It we at least got an email saying that since you missed your flight you have to confirm the rest of your tickets then we would have had a chance to at least avoid a very stressful situation. Our carefully planned vacation is shot. We are trying to get new tickets but will miss several of the planned activities. We are losing time (sitting at airports). We are losing lots of money (buying new ticket) but not Aerolineas Argentinas  again! Avoid if at all possible!

### "comfortable seat for economy"
Santiago to Buenos Aires. Excellent. No problems at all. Will fly again. Great staff at both airport and plane crew, clean aircraft, comfortable seat for economy class flight departed on schedule and arrived 10 minutes before.

### "never book this airline again"
Not Verified |  COR - EZE (Buenos Aires). Our first and last flight with this airline on 12/06/2019. The flight was 2 hours late leaving Cordoba, with no reason given for the delay. We were not informed until after check in and the only information about the delay was on flight departure monitors in the departure lounge. In spite of having a long haul, international flight connection with Air France (a SKYTEAM partner airline) on arrival in Buenos Aires, Aerolineas staff showed no concern that we might miss the connection and when asked whether it was necessary to change terminal in Buenos Aires to make the connection gave erroneous information. (We were told it was necessary to change terminal when in fact it was not). On arrival in Buenos Aires we had 59 minutes to check which terminal our onward flight was departing from and make our connection. No assistance of any kind was given by Aerolineas staff. We made our connection but our luggage did not, inspite of being checked through to its final destination on check in. We understand that our luggage has followed on a later Aerolineas flight, via Madrid, but we have yet to receive it. We received an email on return home from Aerolineas Argentinas, sent on the same day of departure, 3 hours after the flight should have left Cordoba and actually at around the time of arrival in Buenos Aires. It declared that the flight departure time had been re-scheduled! In 35 years of international travel, I have never experienced such utterly brazen incompetence on the part of an airline carrier, whose flight attendants were unconcerned, utterly unhelpful and ignorant of international flight connection arrangements with a SKYTEAM airline partner. Of course, we will never book with this airline again and cannot recommend it in any way.

### "update name from initials to my name"
Not Verified |  I booked my trip via AMEX Web Site to travel from the US to Argentina for the 2019 eclipse. My name on the ticket defaulted to the name on the card using my initials of my first and middle name. I noticed this today, a full two weeks before my flight from the US to Argentina. AMEX and I called Aerolineas Argentinas to update the name on the ticket. The only option was to cancel the flight and rebook to update the name on the ticket. The replacement tickets was $2500 more than the original tickets $3300, plus no refund of any kind. I can't afford to pay another $5500. In addition now I have to cancel 2 more round trip flights that I had booked with Aerolineas Argentinas for domestic Argentina flights for a total of $1500 and I have cancel 7 nights of hotel bookings with no refunds. I'm out $5000 just because the airline could not update the name from initials to my name. Maybe all airlines are like this, but never did I think such a simple change would cause me such a loss. The Aerolineas Argentinas agent first hung up on the AMEX rep and when we called back we got a different rep who seemed to know of my situation and he was unapologetic and extremely rude. He said while I was on the phone that he refused to speak with me.

### "more than 8 hours waiting"
Horrible service, flight from Buenos Aires to Rio de Janeiro supposed to depart at 18:20 on the 31st May 2019 and it was delayed to 2:15am the next morning, more than 8 hours waiting and no one knows anything, gave us a voucher to eat in a poor place called La Churrasquita. Should give a voucher that we choose where we eat, and a place to stay and sleep!

### "Nice experience"
Buenos Aires to El Calafate. The flights were on time. We had a problem with a pilot strike on 30 April 2019, we had to pay for another night for hotel with no compensation. Airplanes were in good shape and clean. Seat were leather covered with good legroom. Inflight service for 3 hrs. 50 min flight was very basic. A cookie and a soft drink or water. In flight Personnel were friendly and professional. They offer upgrade action, but both times we did not accept our bid even though they had available seats. They were not great but were not bad either. Nice experience.

### "the plane was clean"
Cordoba to Buenos Aires. Very professional staff, the plane was clean. Even better now that they are not charging a lot like they used to, and providing a great service.

### "Aircrafts were very outdated and worn"
Dubious business practices from Aerolineas Argentinas - avoid flying this airline. Booked premium economy class tickets and were granted 2x32 kg on the first flight, however on the ongoing flight they only granted us 15 kg and the above amount had to be paid extra at the Airport. Neither the Ticket nor the Boarding Pass states as accustomed to from other airlines the weight of the approved luggage. Aircrafts were very outdated and worn, Crew and ground staff unfriendly especially if you are not Argentinian. Skyteam should seriously think about if excluding this airline from their network.

### "plane looked and felt dated and worn"
You have two terrible choices for flying within Argentina. Latam is a disaster (I'll post more on them - it is truly the worst airline I have ever flown), but not too far behind is Aerolineas. No video, cramped seats, no food even for sale, no beer or wine for sale (this in a country where wine is everywhere). The plane looked and felt dated and worn. Service is indifferent. By contrast, we flew them many years ago where food and beer/wine was complimentary. They have made a decision to go cheap, and it shows in virtually all aspects of the experience of enduring their product. In the US, this would be like flying Spirit, or in Europe, this would be like flying Ryanair. Yes, it is that bad - and I am not prone to exaggeration. At least Spirit and Ryanair don't pretend to be full-service airlines. Aerolineas does, which makes this is even more infuriating. Like I said, virtually all the domestic routes in Argentina are via Latam and Aerolineas. On top of that, almost all the flights go through Buenos Aires city airport (which is actually quite nice). But that means you will have a layover if you are going from one city to another within Argentina that does not include BA. In summary, choosing between Latam and Aerolineas is like choosing between being waterboarded or electrocuted. Just pick the cheaper option, eat before boarding, and just endure this torture.

### "provided the mere basics"
They were essentially no frills and provided the mere basics on a flight. Granted, on a 1 hour flight Air France provides a drink and a croissant or similar pastry, whereas only drinks are provided with the same flight time. For a three hour flight, only a snack mix packet was served. Check in is very fast, boarding passes printed almost immediately, but the lines are long and people seem to turn up very late for their flights often, which means a lot of queue cutting. Boarding is mostly a mess, but bearable. Compared to LATAM’s lines though, Aerolíneas’ lines are relatively short. The 737MAX I flew was amazing. The engines were extremely quiet and the windows were large and gave a great view. The seat is the same as China Airlines. Legroom reasonable for short flights. One thing I am critical about, is that overhead bin space is very scarce. People sometimes have to store stuff 3-5 rows in front or behind them. Flight attendants were such a mixed bag, some were extremely friendly and open for conversation, and some didn’t greet you.

### " Asked to move to emergency row"
Buenos Aires to Rio de Janeiro. Bad service. Asked to move to emergency row because the regular row is too tight for my size (1,93cm) and cause hurt to my legs. The answer was no because I have problems with my legs! Ridiculous. I frequently travel in the emergency row and I am fully capable. That discussion would not exist if they have normal space for legs.

### "Low-end at a bargain price"
Buenos Aires to Rio Grande. When you enter a plane of aerolineas, you immediately fall on the reward of Trip, it gives confidence. Mistake, our 2 flights were incredible, both late (25 minutes for the first and 1:30 for the second), no information, we only warn you when the boarding time arrives, quietly. Following the bad reviews on the forums, and the endless malfunction of the website, we decided to go to the Ushuaia agency to get info on our flight back which was currently nonexistent. ou arrive at check in and there are twenty people at the opening, count 10 to 15 minutes per person minimum. The flight: late, in a dirty plane, the hostesses jostle, splashes and the breakfast is served by running because it seems that it is already very late to do so and for good reason, we land almost at the same time. Add to that the difficulties to pay a ticket on the site, the total lack of communication (no response on any media available), that's a lot for the same company. In short, we are far from paradise. Low-end company at a bargain price! FR: Quand vous entrez dans un avion d'aerolineas, vous tombez de suite sur la récompense de Trip, ça donne confiance. Erreur, nos 2 vols ont été incroyables, les deux en retards (25 minutes pour le premiers et 1h30 pour le second), aucune information, on ne vous prévient qu'on moment où l'heure d'embarquement arrive, tranquillement. L'enregistrement est long, mais long, 40 minutes pour passer une trentaine de personnes. Suite aux mauvaises critiques sur les forums, et au dysfonctionnement sans fin du site internet, nous avons décidé de nous rendre dans l'agence d'Ushuaia pour avoir des infos sur notre vol de retour qui était pour l'instant inexistant... Bin alors là faut oublier, vous arrivez à l'agence et il y a une vingtaine de personnes à l'ouverture, comptez 10 à 15 minutes par personne minimum... Le vol : en retard, dans un avion sale, les hôtesses sont de vraies brutes, on vous bouscule, vous éclabousse et le petit-dej est servi en courant car il semblerait qu'il soit déjà très tard pour le faire et pour cause, on atterrit presque en même temps. Ajoutons à cela les difficultés pour payer un billet sur le site, l'absence totale de communication (aucune réponse sur aucun des medias dispos), cela fait beaucoup pour la même compagnie. Bref, on est loin du paradis. Pour le divertissement, rien sauf leur show : des passagers non-enregistrés qui se présentent à l'embarquement, ah oups, on a oublié une personne en chaise roulante en bas, désolé... Compagnie bas de gamme à un prix classe affaire !

### "did not ship fragile items"
Montevideo to Buenos Aires. Airline act as if it doesn't need any clients in every interaction with the customer. I finally managed to book a flight connecting through their hub in Aeroparque in Buenos Aires. The day before the flight, I managed to check in online after only the second attempt, for the system crashed only once. The bag drop, boarding and flight went reasonably smoothly. However, economy seats are small even for a 5'9" person. In flight entertainment was non existent. On board catering options were bland for a 3 hour plus flight. Connecting in Aeroparque, the international connections terminal is more like a holding pen for tourists with a duty free. Dull uncomfortable seats and one catering option with plenty of microwaveable foodstuffs. Second flight went smoothly, pretty quick hop. On the way back, something I have never seen on any airline belonging to an alliance happened: upon trying to ship a box of fragile items, which I have done numerous times in the past with several airlines (even low costs), the check in personnel refused to do so claiming the airline did not ship fragile items. In the end I had to rearrange the fragile items inside my hand luggage and ship it, and carry a card box full of garments that I had to take out of the bag through two flights and an overnight stay at the airport, all while expecting the worst to my luggage. Fortunately, a rigid bag and smart packing with clothes assured the items arrived in an almost intact state. Never again.

### "action was blatantly robbery"
El Calafate to Ushuaia. We are on a 28-day South America Tour from Australia totalling 15 flights ( 13 with Latam and 2 with air Argentina) and the Latham tickets stated 23kg by 2 pieces baggge per person while the Air Argentina tickets stated one piece without specifying the weight. My wife and I had one piece each of 21kg and no carry on luggage. At check in counter today we were told that the limit per person was 15kg so we must pay 1300 Pesos ( approx 40 USD) and the bags went straight onto the conveyor belt without allowing us to reduce the weight by carrying on some items. We have travelled extensively two to three trips each year and never had a 15kg limit. The airline should have specified the limit if it was below the norm and offered the passenger the option of carry on if over limit at check in. This action was blatantly robbery and deserved to be named and shamed.

### "Avoid this airline!"
San Luis to Buenos Aires. Avoid this airline! Flights from San Luis to Buenos Aires were cancelled throughout the day blaming "meteorologic conditions", even though there was nothing unusual and flights were flying everywhere else with no problem. Customers were advised about the cancellations just minutes before the flight departure (via email), leaving everyone in limbo. When calling customer centre, they were very rude, and said that the tickets did not qualify for reimbursement, only could be rescheduled for another day. Of course, they wouldn't pay accommodation or anything else either. When trying to discuss options with them, they simply hang up. Finally, many passengers opted to take the bus and claim the money later on (good luck with the claim, anyway). Unfortunately, they have the monopoly of many flight routes in the country and there is no competition, so they charge whatever they like for a very poor service. They not only cancel flights with no notice, half of the time there is a strike or some other reason to leave people stranded. Fly this airline at your own risk

### "Nice  plane, welcoming cabin crew"
Asuncion to Aeroparque Buenos Aires. This was a return section and my travelling with Aerolineas after some years. I've read some bad press and I recall long haul on dilapidated 747's and 737s 10 years ago. This was a short 1.5 hr flight but international never the less. I require assistance now and this airline provided it with care to attention and in a dignified manner. Check in is good, you receive an email 24 hours prior "looking forward to seeing you" and even a slightly overweight bag was checked in with a wink. How contrasting to my recent Norwegian experience at LGW. Nice clean plane, welcoming well groomed cabin crew along with a standard seating plan. Basic but complementary snack served by very pleasant crew who didn't seem to struggle with English. On time and disembarking with assistance well managed. A thumbs up and now tempted to return to Aerolineas for my next long haul from Europe to South America.

### "Austral flights were better"
Ushuaia to Puerto Iguazu via Cordoba. I booked three domestic flights with Aerolineas Argentinas and two were on the regional Austral. The flights were closer to being on time than I experienced with other airlines down here, and basically everything went off without problems. The Austral flights were actually better - the Embraer planes are more comfortable and roomy than Aerolineas Argentinas 737s (which looked new but were a bit cramped) and the Embraer seats even have small entertainment screens (can be hard to get earphones though). You get snacks on longer flights, just a drink on shorter flights, and it might be a regional norm that no alcohol is available.

### "One of the most dysfunctional organisations"
Flew Aerolineas from Buenos Aires to Iguazu. One of the most dysfunctional organisations I've ever had to deal with. There is clearly no one who is capable of running a customer focused business who works at this airline. The call centre staff were rude and continuously put me through to a disconnect line. The website forms say 72 hour turnaround times, and no replies are received. I have flown countless airlines worldwide, this is by a very long way, the worst. I would not recommend this airline to people I didn't like, let alone anyone I did.

### "attempted trip back was horrible"
Buenos Aires to El Calfate. My initial flight with the company was okay, if nothing to write home or review about; however my attempted trip back was horrible. The flight was cancelled. I received only a notice the late night before with no explanation. I had no way of getting information as it was a weekend and they do not have weekend hours. When I went to the airport I was informed there were no flights due to a strike. Now while this may have effected more than one airline they did not offer a refund or remedy, or even an apology or sympathy for their clients. I was one of the lucky ones that got in before they left at 2 pm and basically every other passengers had to learn via word of mouth why and how long (5 days before reschedule) they had to wait. Basically swarms of people waiting for information. At the very least there should be an email and apology, truly there should be a refund.

### "the worst I've come across"
I flew Aerolineas on a two week trip with my family from JFK --> Buenos Aires --> Bariloche --> Mendoza --> Buenos Aires --> JFK. I was always a little annoyed with them. I waited on the phone for 30 minutes the day before my flight to reserve seats for the flights and when I showed up to the airport they had no record of my phone call (even though I had gotten an email with seat confirmation) and they had already given away our seats. Given that we had an international flight on our itinerary, we were entitled to two checked bags for each of our flight legs, and every single time they tried to charge us and we had to remind them that we got two free bags - I think they were trying to dupe us. What was most frustrating was that they cancelled our flight home with just over 24 hours advance notice because of a "technical difficulty" with the plane, and instead of having the direct flight from Buenos Aires to JFK that we paid for, they re-booked us (after 1 hour on hold) on a flight to New Jersey. I had a connection from JFK to Boston that I obviously missed, and ended up having to pay for another very expensive flight. I filed a claim and never heard back. I called once to follow up and after 45 minutes on hold I was promised that all claims were addressed within 22 days. 22 days came and went and I never heard back again. I made four additional follow-up phone calls, and each time I was on hold from anywhere from 10 to 45 minutes before I could speak to someone. Every person I spoke to gave a different explanation - from this is the wrong phone number to claims take 2 months (not 22 days) to call Expedia. When I finally started asking to speak to supervisors, two times I was actually hung up on. It is ridiculous that I paid for a flight to JFK, they cancelled it, offered me a flight to another airport, and when I declined, I can't get my money back. I fly a lot, and this airline is the worst I've come across.

### "very happy with them"
Flew with this airline three times domestically within Argentina in November 2017. On the first of these flights, I managed to miss my flight after not hearing the announcement of a late change in the boarding gate. Totally my fault, but Aerolineas put me on the next flight straight away with no extra charge. So had a good first impression of them. The staff all had decent English (which can be rare in Argentina), the interior of the planes are very spacious when compared with what I'm used to from European airlines and the in-flight services were great. Only downside is that the air-fares are higher for non-Argentinian citizens. But that's a common trend in the country. Overall, very happy with them.

### "certainly fly with them again"
Miami to Buenos Aires. Flights on time, food quite good , fresh and tasteful , great service, planes very clean. Entertainment system up-to-date. Only problem : seats are flat-incline which is old fashioned. But airfare was about half of the other competitors. Return trip just as good. Would certainly fly with them again.

### "No complaints whatsoever"
Vast improvement compared to my last experience some years ago. Used Aerolineas Argentinas as a 'feeder' from/to AEP (which is so much more convenient than EZE for my needs) to connect with my Swiss (Edelweiss actually) flights from/to GIG. No complaints whatsoever, brand new, clean planes and enjoyable service both on the ground and in the air. Complementary catering absolutely sufficient for a 3 hour flight with 2 ham/cheese sandwiches, soft drinks and coffee on offer. The only inconvenience was that my reservation number (ticket issued by Lufthansa) wasn't recognized by AR, hence I was unable to make online check-in and reserve seats for the GIG-AEP leg upfront. However, it did work for the return flight once I obtained the locator/PNR code. Overall a good experience and an option I will again take into consideration for my next trip.

### "a brand-new and very clean airplane"
Flew Mendoza to Aeroparque with Aerolineas. Our flight left on time and on a brand-new and very clean airplane. The flight attendants were friendly and the flight uneventful. Only non-alcoholic beverages are served for free which was ok given fair price we paid for the tickets. I would recommend them.

### "Flight attendants were friendly"
Flew Aerolineas from Aeroparque to Puerto Iguazu. A rather good experience. Aeroparque airport is becoming to small for the amount of traffic and hence was rather crammed. The plane looked brand-new and was very clean. Liked the pilots' announcements. In-flight the entire plane sang a cumpleaños feliz. Flight attendants were friendly with one exception. Flight was uneventful. They serve only drinks for free which was no problem given the low fare. I would recommend them.

### "I expect friendly service"
Flew Buenos Aires to Miami. Has to be the worse product flying from South America to the US. Here's why: Product - dated angle-flat seats on a 2-2-2 set up. Most seats were worn out and clearly hadn't been cleaned in a while. Amenity kit very basic and neither the bag or products were branded (vs Coke Hann on AA, Tumi on Delta, Ferragamo on LATAM etc) Food - much less than basic. On the return I was better off having a quick meal at the airport than on the plane. Service - here's my major concern, if I'm paying a lot for business class, I expect friendly service and attention to detail. Anything I wanted I had to ask for it, they would take my glass of wine while they were still half empty and wouldn't ask if I wanted a refill. I had my food tray done for a long time before they picked up Entertainment - basic, ~30 movies (most of them old or Argentinian films). Forget about noise cancelling headphones. Overall impression: I would definitely avoid Aeroloneas as much as I could. I decided to fly with them since I'm a Delta Diamond and wanted to get them miles and Delta only has an overnight flight from ATL to EZE This airline is way overdue for a makeover. Unfortunately, it's government-owned so probably not a chance of any improvements any time soon.

### "The worst kind of service"
Cordoba to El Calafate via Buenos Aires. The worst kind of service I could expect from an airline. We were on a flight from Cordoba to El Calafate via Buenos Aires with a one hour layover in Buenos Aires. First our original flight from Cordoba got canceled (airline's fault) and we were put on a flight which was 40 mins later. This would've meant us missing out on our connection. But when we landed our connecting flight also got delayed by 50 mins. Now the ground staff still refuses to check us in on our original connection with atleast an hour to spare for our original flight to depart. I don't think I will ever fly Aerolineas Argentinas again.

### "one of the worst I flew with"
Buenos Aires to Iguazu return. This company is by far one of the worst I flew with. Service is quite low (nothing is served on the plane at all, no food not even water). Planes are not the newest and comfort is pretty limited. Also, our flight was cancelled last minute because of a strike but no information was given to us until the day before. The first plane to fly back to Buenos aires was 4 days later and it was too late for us. We had to take some bus to go back and the company litterally refused to pay us back for the inconvenience saying that they couldn't prevent the strike. Definitely we recommand to fly other companies in Argentina such as Latam with better service, better planes for the same price.

### "a reasonable experience"
All four legs were right on time. The seating was fine. The A330 out of JFK has angled lie flat seats, which are obviously not the latest and best but which I always find perfectly adequate. The domestic flights were on brand new Embraers with 1x2 seating and ample pitch. Based on this experience, the airline seems to have the basics really pulled together. The only disappointment was the catering. Dinner on the way down was served sloppily (congealed olive oil, no s&p, cling wrap on the dishes) and really unappetizing. And what's with the generic and generically tasting "red or white? wine service? Shouldn't the flagship airline of this wonderful wine country take some pride and feature the best of their production? But I don't fly to eat (and I didn't on the way back), there is pre-departure sustenance in the lounge (though not in AR's own lounge at EZE) and the fares are good. So overall, a reasonable experience.

### "cabin staff were polite"
Buenos Aires (AEP) to Rio de Janeiro in March 2016. Nice flight, check-in very good. Professional and pleasant desk service. Flight departed and arrived on schedule, the flight was very quiet, cabin staff were polite, friendly and professional. The waiting for luggage was a little slow. Nonstop flight and highly recommended.

### "all of them were terrible"
El Calafate to Buenos Aires. We have had several flights with Aerolineas Argentinas. All of them were terrible but I'm going to start reviewing just this last one. We arrived earlier at the airport think we could probably take an earlier flight. Once at the desk of Aerolineas they told us we will have to pay for the change a fee and they told us the fee will be 413 pesos (around $27) which we agreed. They moved us to a different desk to pay and after waiting 30 minutes they told us that the fee was 2800 pesos (around $180) per person. When we said the other person said a different amount they said that this person did a mistake. They had 4 flights before ours and they couldn't have the small gesture of moving to any of them for a reasonable amount. I called the company asking for customer service and they said they don't have customer service. We also did business class from Miami to Buenos Aires with them. I have never seen a dirtiest seat. The tv didn't work, jumping the movies from minute 10 to 30 or stopping.

### "average with room for improvement"
❎ Unverified |  Buenos Aires to London via Rome. I have flown business class in many airlines and this was my first time with Aerolineas Argentinas. The aircraft was modern and business class was average with room for improvement; main issue was that the seats are not fully flat. Food was as expected and the crew were friendly and helpful. Business lounge in Buenos Aires was below average. The one supplied in Rome by Alitalia was superior. Outbound, they left one of my bags in Rome but arrived the following day and a zip was damaged which was very promptly and efficiently repaired at no cost. On the way back it felt like a child care facility with four seemingly unaccompanied children two of whom were visited by a member of the cabin - this type of freebie does not go down well when we have paid a full fee. On the whole, underwhelming but with a bit of more professionalism, it could be up there with the best.

### "worst flight experience ever"
Buenos Aires to Ushuaia via Trelew. Worst flight experience ever had. Strongly discourage any traveller to travel with such an unprofessional airline as Aerolineas Argentinas. We arrived to Buenos Aires at 11pm and that same evening the airline cancelled our 7am flight due to a staff strike the next day. No additional information, no re-routing, no support. Nothing to help international passengers. The next day we spent 8 hours in a queue to get a new flight and were sent o another airport, one hour away from the EZE. Again four hours queue to be put on a waiting list that never provided a flight. After 24 hours waiting, all on our expenses, we were sent directly to Ushuaia (instead of Trelew), lost flights, hotels and car rental, with ZERO compensation. We will certainly avoid Aerolineas Argentinas for their lack of professionalism and mistreatment of clients.

### "nice seating, good service"
A very nice flight with Aerolinas Argentinas from Buenos Aires Aeroparque to Santiago in a brand new aircraft. Very nice seating, good service, sandwich and cold and hot drinks served during the flight. Departure and arrival on time smooth flight. Hope to be on board again soon.

### "food service is very poor"
Buenos Aires Jorge Newbery to Mar del Plata. The punctuality was excellent, the flight departed at the scheduled time. The plane was in excellent condition considering its age since it is a very old plane. The food service is very poor, not a proper service for a passenger who pays the most expensive ticket. The attention of the crew was excellent. The Skypriority service was not very good since my suitcase was last in the airport tape of arrival and in Aeroparque there is no priority queue in the security control. La puntualidad fue excelente, el vuelo salió a la hora prevista. El avión se encontraba en excelentes condiciones y mas considerando su edad ya que es un avión muy viejo. El servicio de comidas es muy pobre, no es un servicio adecuado para un pasajero que paga el boleto mas caro. La atención de la tripulación fue excelente. El servicio Skypriority no fue del todo bueno ya que mi valija salió ultima en la cinta del aeropuerto de llegada y en Aeroparque no hay fila de prioridad en el control de seguridad.

### "not fly Aerolineas Argentinas again"
Buenos Aires to Ushuaia. Aerolineas Argentinas workforce went on strike on 19DEC and suspended activities in the morning until midday; this was not the airline's fault but the airline did not do anything at all to assist the passengers manage the situation before, within or after the event. Just the night before this strike, the airline sent an email confirming flight departure date/time, knowing that the flight would be cancelled due to the strike. At the airport the airline did not provide any support at all to the thousands of passengers affected. All the information provided was that we needed to wait until 1pm to find out what was going to happen with our flights. The airport was a mess of people everywhere. At 1pm when the staff returned to work, all passengers were told to call a toll-free number to get support, no staff at the airport offered to help passengers at all; the toll-free number was congested with calls and there was an automated message asking people to call again the next day - how is that possible when people had flights to take to get back home or to reach a destination where hotels or other items had already been paid. The only reason why we were helped was that we complain so much and remained at the check-in window requesting somebody to help us with our flights, we had to ignore the negative treatment by some of the staff and their management and just held our position until someone decided to help us and put us on a flight - we arrived to our destinations after losing 1 day on our holiday; and upon our return discovered that after that whole situation Aerolineas Argentinas cancelled our return flights which had nothing to do with the original flights impacted by the strike. Once again we found ourselves at the Ushuaia airport being told we had no flights, having to deal with very poor attitude from the airline staff at the check-in counters, but repeated our behaviour as on the first flight and told the staff we would not move until somebody helped us as we had nothing to do with the cancellation of our flights. Finally, a manager agreed to put us an a waitlist and we were lucky to fly back to Buenos Aires. I would not fly Aerolineas Argentinas ever again if I can avoid it; and I have recommended all my relatives and friends to do the same.

### "utter pandemonium and chaos"
Buenos Aires to Florianopolis. There had been a transport strike in the morning, no flights until noon. I arrived at the airport three hours before the 6pm flight. Utter pandemonium and chaos. No staff to direct the thousands of stranded passengers nor the ones with confirmed flights. Over two hours to checkin. Disgraceful. The flight itself was okay. It was 40 minutes late departing, but that seems to be normal for Aerolineas Argentinas. Service minimal, Only good thing was that the baggage arrived at the terminal before the passengers, who were bussed from the plane.

### "Flights went well and punctual"
Booked in September for a December 4-7 Buenos Aires to Ushuaia return thru FlightNetwork. Discovered two weeks later that my flight from USH-EZE was cancelled and cancelled by the airline. Contacted Aerolineas Argentina via their facebook admin with no help but they told me to contact FlightNetwork directly to fix our tickets. After several calls to FlightNetwork and emails our tickets finally got fixed to fly 7th December USH to AEP (Original flight with the same airline was USH-EZE) 7th Dec also happened to be the airline's birthday. Flights went well and were punctual. Plane interiors on my flights were very well maintained. There was the wifi logo at the entrance/ exterior of both planes but there was no such service. For a flight over 3 hours long. They only served normal beverages and cookies. On their birthday, they served an extra but very thin ham and cheese sandwich. Even the bread was sliced thinly. Check-in was functional. 15kg check-in luggage for domestic flights. Pay an additional 150 Argentinian pesos if you luggage exceeds 17kg and up to 23kg. If you exceed 23kg to 30kg, you pay 400 pesos one-way.

### "stay away from long haul"
What started as a very pleasant trip with Aerolineas Argentinas, ended up becoming one of the most bothersome long haul flights I have ever experienced. I flew from Rio de Janeiro to New York with a long stopover in Buenos Aires and a switch of airports in that city. Rio de Janeiro to Buenos Aires (Aeroparque): Aircraft used was a fairly new Boeing 737-800, flight was on time, crew was friendly, decent leg room and the food provided to us was very good (nice sandwich with a traditional argentine alfajor cake) and a good choice of beverages. Nothing really to complain about this flight. Buenos Aires (Ezeiza) to New York (JFK): Aircraft used was a brand new Airbus 330-200. Very modern plane with LED ambience lighting, good entertainment screens with a good selection of movies and music. Sounds great so far right? Well, the downfall begins with the amount of leg room Aerolineas Argentinas have on this plane. I take long haul flights at least 3 times a year and have had experiences with various airlines but I have never seen a plane with such little space as this one. It was really uncomfortable the whole time because of the limited leg room (I am 1,79 cm). Unlike my other flight on this trip with Aerolineas, the food served for dinner was horrible, I didn't eat it at all, worst food I have ever seen on a long haul flight and I heard other passengers complaining about it as well. Breakfast was decent but still overall very disappointed. Crew was uncaring and only offered water during the meal service; not a single time did they pass around the cabin offering water to passengers. My final thoughts? Regional and medium distance flights, Aerolineas does a pretty good job. Stay away from their Long Haul flights though.

### "would never recommend"
Santiago to New York via Buenos Aires with Aerolineas Argentinas. Terrible experience. The flight attendants were rude and not helpful. The seat was small and extremely difficult to sleep in for even a few hours. Worse than the actual flight was the online booking experience. When I landed in NYC I had to transfer to Newark and I didn't realize that in the booking process. So I had to pay $31 to take a bus to another airport after I already landed in JFK. I called Aerolineas to ask for help and I had maybe the single worst customer service rep I've ever dealt with. Aerolineas Argentinas is terrible. Would never recommend.

### "most narrow seat I have ever seen"
New York to Sao Paulo via Buenos Aires. The most narrow seat I have ever seen. My knees came touching tHe seat in front of me during the whole 10 hour plus flight. FA's in a bad mood. Food was just ok but the breakfast was awful. The only good thing I have to tell about them is that the flight was on time and my baggage (which inlcuded a big fragile box) got to destintation without any problems.

### "no assistance to passengers"
Aerolineas Argentinas from Iguazu to Buenos Aires. Abruptly cancelled my flight with no proper notification and no assistance to passengers. Although the disruption was just over 4 hours it caused chaos at the small airport. No notification at the airport was given in English and so some passengers were unaware of what was going on. Staff at the airport initially said the delay could be up to 48 hours. No refreshments were offered and e-mails to the company resulted in their company policy being quoted, basically saying its not their responsibility.

### "you get a disapproving reply"
Flew Buenos Aires Aeroparque to Santiago de Chile with Aerolineas Argentinas; to use up some of my Air France miles. Tried to check-in for my flight from Buenos Aires on their web site, which didn’t work, probably because my reservation code was that of Air France and not Aerolineas Argentinas. When calling Aerolineas Argentinas, in order to find out the reservation code I should use for making the check-in on-line, after a very long wait I ended up talking with the most rude agent I’ve ever encountered. According to her I should have never called AR for this matter since I hadn’t used them for my initial booking. Furthermore, she accused me several times during the call for interrupting her, when I simply tried to explain to her that all I wanted to know was the reservation code that they must have for my reservation in their system. She kept on repeating that she does not work for Air France and eventually, she just hang up! So far so good for Skyteam! Worried about what may be next, I arrived at the airport two hours before departure, to find a nearly empty check-in line. So far, so good! Boarding took place relatively easily, bearing in mind we're in Argentina although by a single bus for a full B-737. Once airborne, a sandwich box and coffee/soft drinks were offered, but of course one shouldn’t ask for beer or wine (despite being a country producing so many great wines), as all you get is a disapproving reply from the cabin crew stating that they don’t serve them on “regional” flights. Well, if their region extends to flights over two hours, I wonder, who made up that policy! At least, landed in time in Santiagio!

### "service above average"
Rosario to Buenos Aires with Aerolineas Argentinas. The service is good. Catering consists on a cookie and a juice. Enterntainment is reasonable for the duration of the flight. Seats are also reasonable for regional flights. Service not outstanding but clearly above average. Priority services are OK given that Aerolineas uses Sky Priority rules

### "biggest criticism was check-in"
I recently flew from Bogotá to Buenos Aires and back on Aerolineas Argentinas. I was not sure what to expect, because reviews are very mixed. Both stretches were flown on their A340. On the outbound route, the seats were very old/outdated, although reasonably comfortable. The in-flight system was very limited with just 4 movies and not the best. On the inbound flight we had a different plane and the seats looked much better, although overall they were the same type, but the video screens were much larger. There was also a bigger choice in movies. On both flights the cabin crew was very attentive and pleasant. The meals, although quite abundant, were mediocre in taste, and in both cases, something or the other was forgotten (like the dressing). Bread was cold and/or stale. My biggest point of criticism was the check-in. I had a carry-on weighing 12.3 kilos. First at the counter in Bogotá they made a big fuss over size, but this particular TUMI bag does fit maximum accepted standards. They insisted I fit it in the thing to measure it and when they saw for themselves it did meet size requirements, they insisted to weigh it and told me to either take out the 2.3 kilos or have it checked. This when on Copa and Avianca they let me take it in on board in Economy, no questions asked, and this was business! On the inbound flight they had 3 counters in Buenos Aires with SkyPriority signs, but all 3 were unstaffed. The last check-in agent just walked away with leaving passengers in the SkyPriority line without saying anything. When I complained to the girl who did check me in at an economy counter, she said I had arrived just during a schedule change (how weird!). All in all it was a mixed bag with the actual flight a much better experience than the experience on the ground. To me their way of dealing with business class passenger in the check-in procedure leave much (!) to be desired. They did not treat us special, on the contrary. It was fussy to say the least.

### "will think twice to fly again"
A domestic Aerolineas Argentinas flight from Puerto Iguazu to Buenos Aires (Aeroparque). The scheduled time of depart was 9:20AM. As we arrived to the airport, no one told us that there is a delay and we were after check-in and security. Finally, we left the small airport at 12:40pm after more than 3 hours of waiting then the excepted. Plane was Boeing 737-700 with easyjet seats which were OK. The snack box was okay and decent for the 1 hour and 45 mins of the flight. Aeroparque's terminal is very nice, clean and comfortable. Next time I will think twice to fly with Aerolineas Argentinas.

### "the good service"
Trelew to Buenos Aires. I was surprised by the good service. I wanted to pay for extra kilo's of luggage since the maximum is 15kgs for an inbound flight and I will fly intercontinental later on. My suitcase was 18kgs but the ground stewardess told me that I don't have to pay for it, 18kgs is no problem at all. I reserved a window seat (5F) and when I came to that place, only 5D was available. My neighbor was a crying baby. In that moment I thought that this was going to be a worse flight. Then a man came to me if I wanted to change seats because he was the father of the crying baby. So: yes please. Still no window seat and I tried to explain that it was rude to take my windowseat, but I don't think he understood. I didn't expect food and drink service for a 1:50hr flight, but they offered us lovely cookies and a drink. Good job for this airline!

### "I am overall pleased"
Buenos Aires to Miami. I have flown Aerolineas Argentinas 10 years ago, and I I was not looking forward to this trip, but since my friends bought it, I was forced to join. To my surprise the airplane was new, excellent condition and even had entertainment. I think it was way better than my Iberia from Madrid to Buenos Aires. The food was very good, I had beef, which is no surprise when you think it's an Argentinian airline. Also wine was great and the crew was professional and efficient. They seemed to be very happy with their job. Entertainment was great on the A330 but not that great on the A340. Of course they are not Emirates or Qatar, but I am overall pleased with this airline.

### "business class seats old"
Rosario to Barcelona via Buenos Aires with Aerolineas Argentinas. Horrible airplane, no plug in for the laptop. Unacceptable in Business Class. Food was horrible, awful croissant and roll, not eatable. Business class seats old, not possible to lay flat completely. It was possible to sleep, therefore with this respect ok. No Airshow, it was frozen after 30 minutes flight and it wasn't reset, even after flight attendants were notified. No chance to know where we are.

### "very good service"
Flew with some friends from Buenos Aires to Iguazu and back in late october with Aerolineas Argentinas. Very good service, specially the cabin crew was very polite and nice and I was surprised by their fluency in german. The flight was comfortable, in time and snacks given was quite abundant for such a short trip. I really can't complain about anything.

### "in-flight service usually good"
Buenos Aires Aeroparque to Mar Del Plata on 17th November, a 6:45am flight actually on Austral E-190. Weather was bad and lightning delayed many flights. Aerolineas Argentinas agents at the gates are either super nice or super awful. The screen says "see agent" for the flight, and the agents don't know anything. Finally after 3 hours they assign our gate and we board by bus and stairs in the pouring rain. Nice Austral E-190 - love these planes. Good knee-room. In-seat video, not a great selection but for the short domestic flights its fine. Flight attendants were all smiles. AR ground service is always bad,   but their in-flight service is usually good. Arrived after 40 minute flight - bags off quick in the small terminal. Arrived safe so that is key.

### "never fly with them  again"
Our Aerolineas Argentinas flight Cordoba-Buenos Aires was canceled during our check in for the first leg in Rosario, the “compensation” was to travel in a cramped taxi with no luggage space, had to carry bags on our laps for 5 hours, to Buenos Aires. We have had no reply to refund request, by what others said, this seems to be usual with Aerolineas Argentinas. Will never fly with them again.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
My flight to Buenos Aires was not full, plenty of room to stretch. Flight to Miami was full because of school vacation, big mistake on my part. The A330 is uncomfortable in economy. When the seat in front of you is reclined, you have the tray table pitted against you stomach, even if you are not fat. The flight attendants should ask everyone to sit upright when serving meals on the A330. Rows are so close that it is impossible to get up from your seat normally. One must slide to the end and climb out. I have flown this aircraft before and they are all the same in Economy - horrible. Considering how packed the flight was, the flight attendants were excellent. The food was mediocre with two choices: pasta or beef, and very small servings. Flight attendants provided drinks generously and water service was available throughout the flight. Bathrooms were kept fairly clean. Movie selection was very good, free headphones were provided. A very uncomfortable aircraft, avoid the A330 Economy. Only seats that looked spacious were the exit row seats. Check-in at EZE was smooth despite crowds and airport chaos.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Flight was delayed 1 hr due to late arrival from Buenos Aires. I used Alitalia Lounge in Terminal 3, modern, large, with limited food options (salads, sandwiches, desserts). I was one of the first to board the plane, so I had to wait almost 30 mins to get any drink/welcome drink, without asking for it, FAs started to give drinks only after boarding was finished. Seat was ok, not full flat, but quite comfy. IFE very poor, only 5 channels available, showing only 2 movies in Spanish/English version, no Air Show with a map available, so had no idea about flight time etc. Cabin crew were nice and smiling, quite senior and during breakfast service, looking very tired and grumpy. Disappointing menu - I was expecting some local dishes from Argentina, some beef etc, and I got green salad with parma ham, risotto or pork with ratatuille or ravioli. I tried first two - all tasted the same, bland, boring, over cooked. No cocktail service at all, as only whisky is available. Good wines. Service in business class is very old fashioned, reminds me service from the 90s, nothing modern as for plating, food presentation, menu etc. Dirty toilet in Business Class. Breakfast started 2 hrs before landing, again - boring tray with fruit salad, yoghurt, bread roll and almost shapeless croissaint, jam and hot omlet with... carrots. Horrible. Generally, very poor business class product. No PA from pilots for whole flight. Not recommended.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
AEP-MTV short 30 min flight. Check in at aeroparque was fast no lines for security line. Boarding by bus 20 min delay no explanation given. Once on board nice FA nice service and arrival nearly on time. Bags short on belt. Good option on this route.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Flight BHI-AEP-BHI August 2014 with Aerolineas Argentinas. A domestic flight both of only 1 hour. Crew were friendly and polite. Catering service was just OK. Aircraft were old but still comfortable (both B737). Both flights on time.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
I was very disappointed with Aerolineas Argentinas. The seats are very uncomfortable they do not have enough space between them vertically. My husband is 6 feet tall and his legs were touching the front seat he had no space to move them. I am 5'5 and was also uncomfortable. It was a long flight almost 9 hours and the TV screens did not function properly. Mine had no image whatsoever. My husband's screen had image but no sound. No entertainment at all for almost 9 hours is ridiculous. We had to take a second flight from Buenos Aires to Bahia Blanca and the flight was delayed 2 hours. On our return from Buenos Aires to Miami the flight was also delayed this time for 1 hour. Even tough the prices of Aerolineas Argentinas are lower I would never use it again or recommended to anybody. I have taken the same flight route with American Airlines and LAN and they are much better. Next time I rather pay more for the tickets and have a more pleasant and comfortable flight.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
AR 1303 April 23rd and AR 1302 April 26th. We were looking for a reasonable Business Class fare from Miami to Buenos Aires we were amazed at how much less expensive Aerolineas was than the other carriers that we checked and were worried that it might be due to an inferior flight experience but decided that since were only flying down for three days to attend a wedding he had to go for it. Well I'm happy to report that with Aerolineas Argentinas you don't "get what you pay for" you get much more. The plane we took was an elderly Airbus that was a bit tattered (especially the bathrooms) but the seats were lie-flat and comfortable the food was above average (much better than American) and the flight attendants were cheerful professional and happy to help with a smile unlike the surly overweight lazy tenured FAs on most U.S. legacy carriers. I would fly Aerolineas again.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
We flew business class (club condor) from JFK on Feb 21 and returned on Feb 28. Great experience. Airbus 330-200 was clean and comfortable. Both flights left on time. Crews were first-rate. Great bargain. Highly recommend it.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
We flew on A330 EZE-JFK-EZE seats are too closed to each other I'm 5 9 tall and had problems with my legs this is what happen when airlines prefer only profit instead of customer service + profit EZE-JFK was 1 hour delayed and JFK-EZE 45mins delayed. Ground staff in both airports terrible neither courteous nor willing to help you. My greatest concern is flight attendants: most of the cabin crew and I mean 90% were rude they got angry if you requested a glass of water or soda (even though you walk to the aft galley to do so). During dinner one female flight attendant offered me chicken or pasta I asked her what kind of pasta and sauce she told me: "sir I'm not the chef who cooked the meals".

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Picked flight based on price. Flight from Miami to Buenos Aires was delayed by 6 hours and then canceled until the next day due to mechanical problem with plane. Re-booked on flight the next day. Luggage did not arrive in Buenos Aires for four days. Return flight delayed by 3+ hours resulting in missed connection. (All flights including connections on Delta were booked through Aerolineas Argentinas.) No help from Miami staff re-booking connection on partner? Delta. Ground staff in Miami sent us to the Delta counter to figure it out for ourselves. Delta would not rebook without us paying for new flight ourselves. Went back to Aerolineas Argentinas counter to find them closed until that evenings flight. Ended up renting car and driving 13 hours home.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
December 22nd 2014. MSP-JFK-EZE-FTE. Flew Club Condor. Others in our party of 5 flew coach. We had the full Monty flying Aerolineas. But the staff handled us well. Flight out left on time but no accommodations for Sky Priority passengers. Charge the gate at JFK was more like it. The food was very good. Service is prompt in that every flight attendant worked to get the job done so they could disappear. We liked how they gave us 3 options for our meals. The ice cream for desert and/or cheese plate were fantastic. And it is true they don't offer mixed drinks. For water they gave us a bottle for the over night flight. Breakfast was again very prompt well presented and the crew when prompted did go the extra step. On the return our child's vegetarian meal was missing. The crew promptly reviewed the menu and told us additional items we could choose from. For the return our flight was changed to add a stop at BRC. At which time we were notified our return to JFK was delayed from 11 pm to 6 am. Sky Priority line did nothing to help us here. We had to suffer with the rest. However they did rebook our last segment with Delta for us and effectively communicated to the crew in JFK to assist us and they did! They offered us a hotel and dinner in EZE. As we missed our JFK connection back to MSP they put us up in NYC and paid for dinner there as well. We turned down the offer for the hotel room in EZE and were able to sleep in the Club Condor Lounge. This is easily better than most First Class Lounges I have seen. Aerolineas in my opinion did much more than Delta United or American would have done for us. Our kids got to spend time touring NYC for the night. Our only downside was the plane could have been cleaner. Sad for a new A330-200. Here the domestic carriers do a better job. For the price we paid on for the ticket and what we got it was well worth it. When this airline makes mistakes they make up for it.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Flew four times over the course of a month internally around Argentina (EZE-El Calafate El Calafate-Trelew Trelew-EZE EZE-Iguazu) and was very happy with service. Check in was prompt and staff were friendly and bilingual. Never experienced any delays in fact we were actually moved forward from a 6 hour change at EZE to a flight departing 5 hours sooner for no extra charge. Snacks and drinks served in all flights and despite the 737-7 seats being noticeably more cramped and less comfortable than the -800 I'd certainly recommend.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
EZE-JFK. The flight was supposed to leave at 11pm. A maintenance issue on the plane but the airline did not announce a delay / cancellation until the boarding time. First the departure time was delayed to midnight and then to 2am. Finally at 1:45am they announced that flight was cancelled. Passport control was closed. Also there were no baggage claim staff. Aerolineas Argentinas decided to reschedule the flight to 6:10am (7+ hour delay vs. original time). After changing the gate and the plane the boarding started at 6.45am and flight left at 7:30am. This airline is terrible. They don't care at all about service.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
I flew with a friend on the 3 December in Club Economy from Buenos Aires to Bariloche with a return booking for 9 December. The aircraft was a brand new Boeing 737-800 and the 2 by 2 sets in the forward Club Economy very comfortable and done in soft leather. A small snack was served by very friendly cabin staff and all was well until the beverage cart rolled by and we asked for some Malbec wine and were told that Aerolineas do not serve wine on domestic flights! One can imagine my surprise that after paying USD $992 per ticket that the flag carrier of Argentina which grows some of the world's finest wines does not showcase this product onboard-they did not even give us the option to purchase wine on a two hour flight! We will be returning to Buenos Aires on LAN.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
For this short 100 min flight from Mendoza to Buenos Aires the economy seat on the 737-700 had plenty leg room and they even served a small lunch box which impressed me. Just beware that row 6 which was behind me has no window. I would not want to be in that seat!

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Flew on Oct 21st from Ezeiza to Miami on AR 1304. Equipment was Airbus 330-200. Traveled in Business Class (Seat 5d) Check in service was very friendly and efficient. Business class lounge was spacious and comfortable and serviced by attentive staff. Boarding was very good and through a separate jet way from other cabin. Welcome on board was very friendly and helpful. Seats are flat but at an angle; very uncomfortable and I kept on sliding downwards. Inflight entertainment was good in terms of equipment but mediocre as far as programming both audio and video. Unfortunately the only WC in business class was out of order so we had to use filthy economy class lavatories. Not good.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
I flew from JFK to EZE on October 2/14. The flight left on time and arrived on time. I travelled in Club Condor. The service was friendly and efficient. New A330 aircraft. The Club Condor seat was an inclined flat seat. I found the seat to be hard and the angle for sleep was not comfortable. I put the seat into a cradle configuration and was able to relax more and sleep for several hours. The food needs improvement - presentation taste and variety were all lacking and considering the price paid to sit upfront I expected better. The entertainment system was good. There were a lot of movies to chose from. There were several places to charge my devices. I would fly with Aerolineas again.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
I flew MIA-EZE-MIA round trip on Aerolineas Argentinas (AeroA) December 24 2013 returning January 7 2014. I bought the ticket online but their website is not set up to allow you to select your seat. So I called their 800 number in the US. I called for 3 days several times each day before someone answered the phone. This agent's English was so bad it took 20 minutes to select my seats. EZE airport check-in at Buenos Aires is chaos. On AeroA all passengers for the MIA flight stood in a single line to be checked-in for only that flight. The same for other flights. We found this out by asking other passengers what to do as there were no AeroA employees or announcement boards present. There were long long lines of passengers snaking through the terminal. Check-in was so slow we were concerned we would miss our flight even though we arrived 2 hours early. It didn't matter though because our flight was delayed 3 hours on a crystal-clear morning. When we arrived at MIA 3 hours late the AeroA gate agents had gone home and there was no one to help us with rebooking our connections to Chicago. The planes both ways were run-down and old on the inside. On the way down a ceiling panel rattled the entire 9 hours. The entertainment system did not work either direction. The flight attendants only appeared 4 times in 9 hours: to serve drinks after takeoff to serve and collect dinner serve and collect breakfast and hand out immigration and customs forms. My advice: 1) Do not fly Aerolineas Argentinas for any reason even if you have to change your travel plans to avoid them or pay more on another airline. 2) If you are unlucky enough to use them and have to fly out of Buenos Aires EZE airport arrive 3 hours early and prepare for the slowest and most disorganized check-in procedure you have ever experienced. 3) If you do not speak Spanish then you will receive only limited customer service on the phone and their web site is primitive. 4) Prepare yourself for old tatty airplanes with no working entertainment system and largely-invisible flight attendants.

Travelled from Madrid to Buenos Aires in May as the starting point of my South-American holidays. Reasonable prices and a remarkably good service all along the flight. There was a wide range of food to choose including delightful Argentinean beef. Check-in was fast and simple and the flight had no delays at all.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Montevideo-Aeroparque-Asunción. I have to say that there is an improvement in the service. Still there are delays and poor customer service on the ground. But on board there are new and comfortable planes and nice and attentive FA. Connecting in Aeroparque (Buenos Aires city airport) is always fast and easy. First leg delayed connection on time. Bags arrived at my destination with me.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
I always fly American Airlines first class in my trip JFK-EZE-JFK. I decided to try the business class (club condor) with Aerolineas Argentinas. I regret to says that the business class of American Airlines is much better. The seat at the club condor are ok not flat bed but ok. We were welcomed with orange juice a cheap champagne and candies. The menu says only one appetizer (no choice) and 3 main courses. Two options are for the breakfast time. The whole experience with the catering was horrible. From the presentation to the quality the food did not respond to a business class. Do not expect to have any cocktails since they only have wine beer and whisky. The dessert was a piece of rock (ice cream) and we received hard croissant and bread in our breakfast. The returning flight did not even have all three dinner options and the food was horrible as well. I wonder how do they plan to compete with such a horrible presentation. They do not provide you with the custom forms for USA.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Even though Aerolineas Argentinas has received too many complaints from customers recently my flight from Sao Paulo Brazil to Buenos Aires Argentina on March 1 2014 in Premium Economy Class was great and I have no complaints. The flight was on schedule the flight crew were polite and helpful. Aerolineas Argentinas' premium economy class is the same as most US companies' domestic first class. The seats are J seats very comfortable and the food in this class was also a great sandwich yoghurt and a chocolate muffin. Compared to service in the same route provided by Brazilian companies I have flown and comparing also the price Aerolineas Argentinas Premium Economy class is far better in service and mainly in seat comfort!

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
MIA-EZE and return Dec. 24 2013 - Jan. 3 2014. A below-average airline. Their website is so primitive it is impossible to reserve seats. Their toll-free number is not manned 24 hours a day astonishing. On our plane to Buenos Aires none of the in-flight video worked for the entire flight. There was a loose panel in the ceiling over an aisle and it rattled the whole 9 hours. The food was mediocre even by airline standards. The flight attendants were businesslike but disinterested. The plane was only about 1/2 full but the FA's were often nowhere to be seen. Our flight back was 3 hours late leaving EZE after a chaotic check-in at the filthy Ezezia airport. At Ezezia you do not stand in one line for all flights and go to the next available agent. Instead there are separate lines for each flight no indication of which line you should stand in and the agents appear when they feel like it. There was no explanation for the delay and no apologies. If you have any other option for flying between the US and Argentina I would take it.

Rio to Buenos Aires AEP on 737. Departure delayed by 30min and arrival to AEP slightly behind schedule. Plane in good condition (must say that the new livery looks better than the old one). Sandwich and drink offered during flight. Crew fine. AEP is easy to navigate. Luggage (priority tagged as FB Elite) arrived fairly quickly and first on band. Was dreading flying AR but flight was overall fine. Planning to fly them long haul in C class from Spain in May.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
SYD-EZE on 29/10/2013 and returned EZE-SYD on 22/01/2014. The check-in at Sydney was slow and inefficient. There is no online check-in option for this flight and no seats are allocated prior to check-in so though you should only need to be there 2/3 hours before for an international flight I actually was told to get there 4 hours before just to get a decent seat and even then I queued for nearly an hour to check-in. Boarding was smooth and uneventful. The plane was clean but old. The in-flight entertainment system is horrendous. Considering this is a 15 hour direct flight there is no seat-back entertainment system. There is one large monitor at the front of the cabin and a few smaller ones spaces sporadically. The picture quality is terrible obviously no option to select subtitles if you are not a Spanish speaker. The movies were the same two films on repeat for the 15 hours. Nothing else. The food was adequate though the ran out of some food options leaving my companion to eat vegetarian or nothing else. Obviously the wine is good - it's Argentinean - but the drinks are just served with meals. If you press your call button it is ignored and switched off. I gave up trying to get some water. Breakfast was terrible none of it was edible. Flying back EZE-SYD was not much better. Check-in was a little easier and fortunately this time I managed to get a window seat. Upon boarding I discovered the plane was not full so I had two seats to myself. The only good thing to happen on this flight. The food was just as bad the availability or lack thereof of drinks was the same as before. The toilets were filthy and were obviously not checked or cleaned during the flight. The call-buttons were again ignored. The entertainment system was the same again this time they showed two English language films with Spanish subtitles a slight improvement but still the same on repeat for 15 hours. I would not recommend Aerolineas economy to anyone.

AEP-MDZ MDZ-AEP in a new embraer. Really satisfied with the service. A small beverage offered with some 'alfajores' to eat. Nice trip in both ways and both legs on time. Really impressed by improvement of Aerolineas compared with its competitors in Europe. Small entertainment offered with Argentinean music videos and TV shows. Fantastic.

AR 2467 from Mendoza to BA on 17/02. Several flights in last 3 weeks. Flights late no information staff unhelpful and couldn't even be bothered to clear the cabin. Missed one connection and took three attempts to get anyone to rebook it. Our luggage went without us. Thought Vietnam Airlines were bad but AA could teach them a thing or two!

I took 3 domestic flights (Aeroparque-Salta Menodza-Bariloche in Y and Bariloche-Aeroparque in C-Class) with Aerolineas Argentinas in the last 3 weeks. Each flight was leaving and arriving on time the crew were nice though not all of the crew members spoke English. The snacks as well as the drinks offered were rather boring but free of charge. The planes were comfortable enough for the short flights especially the brand new Embraer of Air Austral with IFE in each seat were great!

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Took 4 flights in Jan: SYD-EZE - no dramas other than ordinary food and lack of entertainment (a tiny central screen that is off color and barely able to hear the audio on my headphones) on a 15.5 hr flight. EZE-FTE - they changed the airport 8 hours before the flight (from EZE to AEP ) luckily I arrived early and they put me on a bus to the other airport. Delayed 30min. FTE-EZE - delayed 3 hours apparently because of storms in BA that morning but I had a 1630 flight and they never managed to catch up. EZE-SYD - delayed 16 hours initially for heavy rain in BA then they needed fresh crew then the new crew arrived late then missed curfew at Sydney airport. We waited at the airport and departure times kept getting pushed back. Missed my domestic connection but was able to rebooked the next day. At least the airport has free Wi-Fi. Staff do not care and were not helpful will never fly them again!

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Flew to Buenos Aires from Sydney in early January and back in late January. The flight from Sydney started with one hour delay and arrived before scheduled time due to fortunate conditions. Inflight entertainment was on a central screen 2 movies ok. The food was not great but reasonable for economy. I had to change my flight by 2 days going back Aerolineas made that very expensive for me. The return flight was very poorly organised. Check in was extremely slow with unnecessary delays. Subsequently the take off was delayed 2.5 hours without explanation. The flight itself was uneventful with the aircraft arriving 3.5 hours late. Movies on board were the same as on the flight to BA and were repeated. Meals were minimal. No drinks were offered in between meals.

On Dec 18th we left Miami at 7 pm for Buenos Aires. Average flight nothing special. Arrived in Buenos Aires at 5.30 am and went to our assigned gate at the domestic terminal. We were booked on Flight 1880 to Ushuaia that was to leave at 7.45 am (12/19/13) giving 30 hours to catch our 3pm (12/20/13) Antarctic cruise. Fl 1880 was postponed to 8.50 then to 10.30 without explanation. Then told the flight would leave at 3 pm. The flight didn't leave at 3.00 we were then told 8.30pm. What happened at 8.30 pm the postponed time for the scheduled flight is something out of a movie. We were never told that the flight was cancelled we were just told the flight would not be taking off. 2 hours later we were transported by bus out to the tarmac to board our plane to Ushuaia. After stopping at Trelow and taking on more passengers we were scheduled to arrive in Ushuaia about 2 am on 12/20. Landed at a small airport. The captain then for the first time announced that we were in El Calafete instead of Ushuaia. In the early morning hours of the 20th we are waiting in an unscheduled airport not knowing when or if we would arrive in Ushuaia. 2 hours later we board a plane and much to our relief we arrived in Ushuaia at 6am. Needless to say we did arrive at our cruise on time but we had one change of clothes to last us a whole 8 day cruise. We were never offered an explanation for the postponed and cancelled flights and then were diverted to a different airport without warning or explanation. We will never travel this Airlines again.

Dramatic improvement - would use them again. They have obviously spent a lot of money over the past 3 years on new planes with in-flight entertainment. Service was friendly and our flights on time (AEP-SCL).

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Aerolineas Argentinas provide the worst customer service that I have received from any airline. One of the internal flights was cancelled due to a strike by airport staff (Puente de Aereo - Buenos Aires). We had to queue for 6 hours to speak to a representative (during a heat wave where the temperature was close to 40 degrees C). When we did finally reach the front of the queue we were offered an alternative flight for 5 days after the original flight date and were not offered any compensation in terms of a snack or alternative accommodation. Their attitude throughout was "it's your problem". On our final flight back to Bogota they changed the flight time from 6.30am to 5.20am around a month before the flight. We turned up 3 hours before the flight as instructed on the ticket only to find no check-in staff present. We waited 1 hour before a single representative turned up and when I asked why staff weren't present to check us in at the time that we were requested to be there I was told "it's very early". This was another example of their attitude towards customers. As a result the flight was delayed by 2 hours. In conclusion the customer service levels at Aerolineas Argentinas is a joke.

I was booked on flight AR1893 USH-FTE 2nd Jan 2014 departing at 13.35. Arrived at the airport at 12.00 facing a long queue due to problems with check in system. Around 45 min prior the flight departure while still queuing for check in they announced our flight cancelled. They made us wait until 19.00 to tell us that we had to come back tomorrow for more info. We were given no food not hotel organised. Staff at the airport were arrogant refusing to speak English to non Spanish speaking customers and uninformative. Never again!

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
I was on the inaugural flight to Buenos Aires from JFK and while the service at the airport was great and went through without any hitches the service on the flight was horrible. The flight attendants had such a bad attitude and passengers flicked on the service light for the entire flight and not once did I see someone respond. They basically served dinner and then left the cabin for the entire time until breakfast. I was dehydrated and not feeling well and wanted some water and didn't see anyone come so being that I was in the window seat I flicked the service light and after an hour of waiting I finally went to look for someone all the way at the back of the plane and they were all sleeping (it was 7pm). It was such a bad service experience that I will sadly never fly again and recommend that no one else fly either. You have one chance to make an impression and they really blew it with me.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
I traveled to Buenos Aires from Miami on the 8.30am flight on 12/21/13. 5 hour delay no explanation. The cabin was dirty pieces of sticky food on the small video screen. Numerous AR employees and ex employees meandering around the business class cabin socializing with flight attendants and members of the crew certainly not helping the already poor service they were delivering. Multiple FAA safety violations. Example: people standing while the aircraft was moving luggage obstructing the pitch during take-off and landing etc. Service was awful. In addition to leaving 5 hours late it took them 2-3 hours to serve the first drink. When they finally came by with drinks I ordered a whisky. The flight attendant explained they did not serve whisky until after lunch and that that she did not have any whisky in her cart. She did not have the Shiraz wine that they listed on their menu either so I settled for whichever red wine she could give me. Lunch was mediocre and immediately after the service all flight attendant disappeared for about 7 hours until they brought the "snack". Not even a glass of water throughout the flight. Finally while sleeping the flight attendant woke me up because the back of my seat was "bothering" the passenger behind me probably because the seat was "defective and reclined too much". The whole point of paying for business class is for the seat.

Took seven domestic flights on Aerolineas Argentinas during December 2013. Of the seven one (Salta to Buenos Aires) was cancelled but postponed as a new flight the second (from Buenos Aires to Trelew on the same date) was cancelled and the passengers left on the airport overnight for 10 hrs. There were no announcements and the new flight never appeared on the board. We were given a chance of free dinner at a pizza place on the airport but no hotels. We foreigners pay more than twice of what locals pay!

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Traveling with my children from NY to Córdoba via Buenos Aires. The NYC-EZE flight was delayed more than 8 hours. Luckily they emailed me before I set off to JFK airport. The problem is that they forgot that we had a connecting flight and did not make any provisions at all. Calling the Call Center to try to find out what to expect once in Ezeiza (stranded for 24 hours with two young kids? sent to a hotel? put in a different flight from the domestic airport?) was total waste of time. They don't even bother to pick up the phone. In summary: only fly Aerolineas Argentinas if no other option is available. They are unreliable have no customer service whatsoever and will not hesitate to leave you stranded. And never expect an apology.

I flew from Sydney to Buenos Aires and then to Bogota with Aerolineas Argentinas last week and then returned the same way a few days later. The aircraft appeared very new and I have absolutely no complaints about seats or bathroom or cleanliness. The food was as good as any I have had on Qantas and the staff were as good or nearly so.

I took three flights in November. Buenos Aires (AEP) to Cordoba Cordoba to Mendoza and Mendoza to Buenos Aires (AEP). They were award tickets through Sky Team (Delta) points. I was a little apprehensive after reading the comments here but in my case the flights all left close to on time and the aircraft were nearly new. Seating was comfortable and space was adequate. On each flight there was a beverage service and small snack box.

Sydney-Buenos Aires-Rio: AR1181 and AR2254 on 26 Sep 2013. Rio-Buenos Aires-Sydney: AR2255 and AR1180 on 11 Oct 2013. Really bad. Flight was heavily delayed from Rio to Buenos Aires and I missed my connecting flight to Sydney. Meal awful old plane with no inflight entertainment staff very rude. Avoid at all cost better pay $500 more and go with a trusted company.

Flew Austral economy from Sao Paulo-Buenos Aires-Mendoza-Santiago. All in EMB190 jets. Only the Mendoza to Santiago flight were on time. Service was ok and the seats were quite comfortable with a good pitch.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
I've flown this airline 12 times. Something bad has happened every single time. Aerolineas Argentinas has a near-monopoly in many Argentinean markets which is very unfortunate. On my most recent trip the flight schedules were changed an astounding 6 times within 3 months of departure with the final one being a cancellation of my flight and a new departure from a different airport. Once you do have an actual confirmed flight the chances of it leaving on time are close to zero. My personal record was an 8-hr delay causing me to miss my connecting flight back to the US.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Flew Sydney - Buenos Aires and Buenos Aires - Sydney. Pros: Staff helpful. Good value for money. Cons: Seats are old and sometimes broken. Food is average they serve just 2 meals in a long flight so take some with you during the flight. Old airplane and does not have entertainment system. You need to take a tablet with you - they don't allow phones even in airplane mode. Flights delayed.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Rio de Janeiro to Montevideo via Buenos Aires and return via Buenos Aires and Iguazu to Rio. Mixed experience first flight left at 2.40am from Rio to Buenos Aires on an Austral Embraer 190 and due to heavy turbulence there was no inflight service whatsoever on the 3 hour flight no apologies at all from the crew which I found rude. Short hops from BA to Montevideo and back uneventful. The return legs were better. Flights left and arrived on time crews on both Embraer 190 (Austral) and B737 did their job well. Their spoken English is awful if I didn't speak Spanish I wouldn't understand a word of what they announced.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
The flight from Sydney to Buenos Aires was awful - the food was disgusting the toilets were not cleaned for hours - hence the smell. No entertainment other than outdated TV hanging from ceiling distorted picture and mainly in another language that could not understand. Seat in front of me was broken and was on a constant lean. The staff or should I say lack of it spent more time talking to one another or reading a magazine than attending to the passengers. The flight home was no better - it might of been cheaper but had I known what they were like I would of gladly paid the extra and flew with Qantas. I would not recommend that you fly with this airline I certainly will not.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
By far the worst airline I have flown. Flew Sydney to Buenos Aires in a plane that looked like it was from the 60's. It was filthy on the outside and inside was even worse. When I opened my blanket on the plane it smelt. The staff were almost non existent during the entire flight. For the price I paid spending a few more dollars to fly with a competent airline with modern planes would be completely worth it.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Tucuman-Buenos Aires-Tucuman. Two good flights the first on a Boeing 737-700 departed on time and arrived 15 mins early. Flight service is efficient and cabin crew very friendly. Totally recommended.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
The saying that you get what you pay for is spot on when it comes to Aerolineas. Great value for money if you don't have high expectations of the airline in the first place. Flight to BA was fine. No delays and food ok. The flight back however took off 2.5 hours late and then stopped in Patagonia with no explanation as to why so all up the journey took over 18 hours instead of 13.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Flew return MIA-EZE and was a bit worried after reading the post. Have to say was very surprised on the outbound flight as the crew were very nice and attentive the food was good and the "new" business seat OK. The inflight entertainment was the flight map since nothing else worked. The cabin was tatty but clean so all in all ok marks for that. The return on the other hand lived up to everything I have read. This crew would put to shame any US crew when it comes to sitting in the galley doing nothing. Food was terrible and yep got a thimbleful of wine. Glad it was overnight so I got to try and sleep but that was hard given the number of families that the pilot FA's and gate agents brought up to the business cabin. All in all I still think they were an OK airline if you had no other choice.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Arrived at the airport at 4.30am supposed to fly to Sydney at 8.30am had a connecting flight to Melbourne from Sydney. Flight was delayed until 9.30am then until 1pm didn't leave Argentina until 2.30pm now stuck in Sydney airport on the floor because Qantas have a cut off time on the weekend and Aerolineas Argentinas managed to get me after the cut off time when I was supposed to be here at 5pm! If there is another airline out from Argentina I would take that instead if this one. Even the flight entertainment is poor. You don't get your own screen so you're stuck watching these old tvs that the worst picture known to man. The only good thing was that I got 2 seats to myself. Probably because everyone knows not to fly with them!

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
We flew return to Buenos Aries from Sydney. Condor class was not a lot more expensive than economy given the 16 hour trip. We had plenty of leg room and the food was excellent. The seats and everything seemed to function. Flights were on time and our luggage arrived on the carousel. Check in was speedy. As other reviewers noted the planes are old so I needed a cushion for lumbar support and we took tablets with books and movies downloaded. This worked very well with excellent picture and sound quality. Staff perhaps could have done more to keep others under control eg a couple immediately behind us watched videos on their laptop with no earplugs so we got the full sound while we were trying to sleep. Given the reviews we were pleasantly surprised with the trip.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
We recently traveled on 3 domestic flights within Argentina - Buenos Aires - Iguazu - Salta - Buenos Aires. We had no problems with any of the flights. They departed on time and our luggage arrived safely. Check in was super fast. The planes were reasonably modern and staff service OK. Food consisted of a snack box which was adequate for a short haul flight. While the flights were expensive prices were reduced considerably by purchasing discounted tickets before we arrived in Argentina. Given the reviews we were pleasantly surprised with the flights or perhaps we were just lucky. There was certainly nothing wrong with them.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Pretty average flight Sydney-Buenos Aires. No seatback screen food OK. The return flight BA-Sydney was poor. The same movies were showing as 5 weeks previously! The food was awful. The service was ordinary. Nobody appeared to have checked the toilets for about the last 8 hours of the flight - no toilet paper full bins - disgusting.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Buenos Aires to Trelew and back. Overall very good service for the value. Smiling and helpful cabin attendants and good snack box provided on such a short flight. No inflight entertainment only magazines (this point should be improved). Fast and efficient baggage delivery. I would certainly recommend this airline.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Sydney to Buenos Aires return. Plane out very old and needing internal maintenance. A couple of overhead locker taped up with do not use notices. The TV that I could see did not work. Didn't see the cabin staff smile once. Seats are tired and sagged. Food was good though I had taken bits to eat but the meal we got was good. No in flight services after the meal but drinks and snacks available. On the way back we were at the airport 23 hours before the flight (due to our connection) and requested a row of seats together. Couldn't check us in as check-in opened 3 hours before. When we checked in 3 hours before we were sat in different seats over the plane and told there were no available seats! Managed to get the children sat together and myself and my wife were in separate seats. On return the plane was in a slightly better shape a little newer. The TV was working but lost the red so some interesting colours for the films. Reasonable films and one channel in English. Food was again good. The cabin staff were great. All smiles and they came round every couple of hours with water/juice. Value for money was excellent.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Flew home from Sao Paulo to Sydney in January 2012. 4-hour delay departing change of aircraft at Buenos Aires resulted in an 8-hour delay. Passengers asked to wait in a lounge then abandoned. No staff for several hours. After 6 hours we got a rapid announcement in Spanish. Passengers were English-speaking Australians! BA to Auckland was unpleasant. TV screens were not working well. The girl in front of me ordered a vegetarian meal as did I. Of course they did not have it. They never have vegetarian meals. The hostess actually argued with the girl and told her that it was her fault that the meal was not ordered. The final insult was a 4-hour delay at Auckland Airport. I will never fly Aerolineas Argentinas again.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Flight between Sydney and Buenos Aires was pretty good. Staff were friendly and spoke English! Once I arrived in Buenos Aires this changed. Next flight was to Sao Paulo but they refer to it as San Pablo. This flight was delayed a couple of hours but the staff were pretty good. Once I arrived at Sao Paulo the service was not as good but still okay. Staff seem tired and run down. Staff at the gate could not decide which gate the airline was at. If your a person of English speaking background and don't know much Spanish or Portuguese it pays to find someone to translate. I flew to Curitiba and the service was excellent and staff were friendly! We arrived on time. On the way back my flight got delayed and was going to be diverted from Buenos Aires due to poor weather. A nice stewardess kept me informed of this. Staff were very professional with the delay too. Overall a great experience.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Miami to Buenos Aires. The cabin service was a disaster staff treated passengers in a disrespectful manner. Is only worth flying with them if you need leg room and have to take extra luggage. Seats are in a bad condition amenities - many of them do not work at all and the selection is very poor.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
We bought this ticket to fly from Sao Paulo to Sydney everything went wrong from the beginning. Our flight was delayed 10 hours on the way to Sydney and on the way back they cancelled the flight. After 9 hours we were sent to a hotel near the airport no employee of the Airline anywhere. Bought a new ticket from Lan airlines.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
SYD-EZE-GIG-IGR-EZE-SYD Plus AEP-FTE-AEP. What a great airline for the price. We flew Club Condor class ex SYD. Before buying the ticket I researched the airline so I would know what to expect. It exceeded my expectations. Got the above ticket for AUD 3700.00 The only sectors in economy were AEP-FTE-AEP. Of the 7 flights all left on time except one and that only was delayed 20 mins. Food was great service was great. If you wanted anything they were more than obliging to help. Will definitely fly AR again.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Australia to Brazil. I had no problems at all during the flight. No delays service wasn't that bad and staff were friendly. I wasn't able to eat the food served because my agent (nothing to do with AA) forgot to send the request for vegetarian food (must be done when the booking is made) and they didn't have much options for non- meat eaters. There's no entertainment at all. You pay what you get for the price I paid I am satisfied.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
My flight was overbooked and I was forced to stay in Brazil for extra 3 days. Staff at Rio airport are very rude. No apology from staff for not having a place for me and my son to return to Sydney. I also lost time at work which I was not paid for. All of this for choosing to travel with Aerolineas Argentinas for many years. I now will travel with any other airline never Aerolineas Argentinas again.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
We flew Club Condor (business class) from Sydney to Buenos Aires and then on Austral (regional airline) to Rio and back. It is obviously an airline of a country in economic crisis. Aircraft used on the SYD-EZE-SYD route is like stepping back into 1975. Big old recliner seats (not flat) 3 scheduled movies on a continuous loop. No laptop power etc. The service is very basic to other carriers. AA club condor service is similar to what's offered in economy on other carriers. This is an extremely long flight close to 16 hours yet AA still doesn't use their brand new Airbus with lie flat beds I believe this is used to Madrid and back for obvious reasons. The crew on all sectors didn't really want to be there. EZE-SYD is one of the longest flights in the world made even longer by the aircraft and the service. We would choose to go with Qantas/LAN via Santiago in future trips to South America.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Sydney - Buenos Aries 19th March 2013. Quite the worst business class flight we have experienced. Only good things to say about it is it arrived safely on time after a 13 hr.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Sydney to Buenos Aires and return in April 2013 in business class. Yes it's an old aircraft and the seats are only the old lounge chair type. Also the entertainment is limited. But they are replacing the A340-200 with a 300 series later this year so that should solve these problems. The business class check in was performed meticulously and lounge access given at both airports. Priority boarding was strictly enforced. The on board service was friendly and very personal. My coat snatched away and hung up as soon as I arrived at my seat. The catering was adequate and appropriate for such a long flight. Main courses were presented and served from a trolley in the cabin. They did offer fast track on departure but not on arrival. Still the airport in Sydney was so quiet it was unnecessary. One small criticism is that the Sydney arrival cards were in Spanish. Not easy for us Aussies. The price paid for the ticket represented unbelievable value. I'd fly the again without hesitation.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
SYD-EZE no online check in a real mess at the check in even though Qantas were doing it. Food out on the night flight was okay but could only have 1 half glass of wine. Trip back again no online check in be at the airport 3 hrs before but had to stand around for 50 mins before any processing began. Was told 3 weeks before the flight it would be delayed 20 mins - got to the Airport it was shown to be 1 hr delay but eventually the 8.30am flight departed at 11am. Food was dreadful but this time could get more than 1 glass of wine. There was no explanation as to why the flight was delayed. Experienced similar on Austral (a subsidiary) had to be there 2hrs before and it still departed late. Iguazu-Salta cheese sandwich offered which was thicker - the bread or cheese? No online check in but their adds tell a different story.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
My husband and I recently travelled on Aerolineas Argentinas from Buenos Aires. There was no facility for web check-in or to have our seats pre-allocated prior to check-in. We arrived more than 2 hours prior to the flight to be told that the only way we could sit together was to take 2 middle seats in the centre row of the plane. The A340 has a 2-4-2 configuration. In such a configuration 50% of the seats are aisle seats. However it appeared that almost all had been pre-allocated prior to the ordinary check-in opening. In the end we were offered an aisle and a middle seat in the very back row. It is time that Aerolineas recognized that families are entitled to expect to sit together on long haul flights without having to take the worst seats on the plane. Other airlines manage to do this why cant Aerolineas?

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
SYD-EZE-SYD. Only use AR to get from SYD to EZE if you can't avoid it! The seats are rock hard but with better leg room than many. No on-line check-in or seat selection. No early bag drops on transfers meaning I had to wait for 3 hours at EZE before passing through immigration. (At 2am.) No in-seat entertainment and the two in-cabin screens-and sound - only worked part of the time. The same low res movies shown in both directions. The food coming back from EZE was the worst I have ever had on an airline with a tiny dried-up croissant tiny hard roll and insipid yoghurt offered as breakfast and pasta with a teaspoon of tasteless tomato sauce for lunch. I could not even get any pepper when I asked. Red wine was good though. Food out of SYD was much better. Excellent new terminal C at Ezeiza and 57 nice new aircraft in Argentina - pity these advancements don't extend to the Australian part of the operation. Contrary to a lot of the other reviews I found the staff to be friendly and helpful.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Sydney-Buenos Aires. We arrived safely which is about the only good thing I can say about this flight. The first time a crew member smiled was saying goodbye as we left the plane. No IFE to speak of no drinks (water) offered after dinner no snacks lights turned off and staff disappeared. Breakfast was cake and very cold solid bread roll. Very poor. Not looking forward to return flight home.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
I'm a frequent business class customer although on domestic flights this 'business class' turns into 'club economy'. It is hard to understand that the most expensive seats carry the name 'economy' attached to them. The catering service is very poor excluding alcoholic drinks and real food which is replaced by sandwiches served in a a very 'low cost' style box.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Sydney to Buenos Aires. Was travelling on the great unknown with this airline so I kept my expectation's low. Plane full with lots of legroom for 18 year old plane. Food was ok with snacks and drinks which you had to get yourself. Great views of the Antarctica if only the staff would let us see most of the flight the shades were kept down. Bring your own entertainment but they did show a couple of movies. For $1200 round-trip plus 2 internal flights I really can't complain.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
After a six month assignment in Argentina flying almost only Aerolineas Argentinas and Austral I was pleasantly surprised with the experience. Almost 30 domestic flights and no cancellations only one significant delay (3 hours) due to airport strike. Service good to excellent free snack (5-8 dollar value to US domestic standards) beverages offered once or twice (even on flights under an hour) Flight attendants friendly and efficient. I am impressed it is now better than any domestic option in the US.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Sydney to Buenos Aires then to Santiago and return. Flying to and from Sydney the seats were very hard and uncomfortable. The plane seemed very old. Inflight entertainment poor quality TV and screen. Food was just bearable. The only flight that left on time was the one out of Sydney. First and last time flying with AA. Delay in BA to Santiago due to not wanting to fuel the plane in the rain. Delay from Santiago to BA no idea why. A supposed delay of 22 mins which turned into just over an hour from BA to Sydney which caused me to miss my connecting flight. So overall not happy with the experience. Also trying to check in at Santiago to fly to BA took the check-in lady well over half an hour. Real disappointment for a holiday I had waited 1 year for.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Sydney to Buenos Aires return. The aircraft used for this route are old but seats are as comfortable as other airline's with more legroom than most. The meals were adequate if not great with ample self serve snacks. Drinks available throughout the flight and the service was polite and friendly. Taking my own entertainment (on a tablet) was no problem considering the savings being made on the price of the tickets compared to the prices charged by the competition. I also caught several Aerolineas regional flights in South America on new aircraft as it is are in the process of adding new aircraft to its fleet.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
We flew on direct flights Sydney to BA return in September 2012 - the attraction of a lower business class fare than competitors and a direct flight swayed us into trying the airline. The outward flight left early from Sydney and arrived early in BA. The return flight left 30 minutes late but picked up the time on the way home. On both sectors the service was prompt and efficient. Food and wine was good but not presented as top tier carriers would present. The entertainment system was archaic limited and not on demand. This is well documented by other reviewers. We took kindles and an ipad and once we watched one movie we were quite happy to read and play. Views of the Antarctic ice sheet also kept us amused on the way home. Seats are old style business but we did sleep nearly 9 hours on the night flight on the way over. If this one experience is the norm for this sector I would recommend the business class offering given the price advantages - you can overcome the most significant weakness (IFE) by buying movies for your ipad and you can buy plenty for the saving in air fares.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
A340-200 SYD-EZE. I felt like I have stepped back in time when flying with this airline. They need to update the seating in the older aircraft. Very little attention is paid to safety carry on bags were left unsecured on seats during take-off. Seats were broken and reclined without pushing the recline button. Despite the seats being broken passengers were permitted to use them. There was no personal entertainment and it is strictly bring your own. Before and soon after take-off the cabin became very cold. Approx 1 hour into the flight the seat belt sign was turned off for the first time shortly after staff delivered the food. There was no choice of meal (chicken or red meat) let alone a vegetarian selection. After dinner the food trays were collected and the lights turned off and all passengers were expected to sleep. The staff must have also turned up the temperature as the aircraft cabin became very hot and stuffy. The flight was 14 hours and passengers were expected to sleep 10 of those hours. Approx 2 hours before landing the lights were turned back on we were fed again and the cabin became very cold. Trays removed just in time to land in Buenos Aires. Staff were seen at the rear of the craft playing on laptops and not offering any drink runs to passengers.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
FCO (Rome) - EZE. The lack of IFE was an obvious flaw but my tablet computer lasted the whole journey so it was ok. The food wasn't great but the white wine was superb. Staff were very nice and even though I was Australian flying from Italy they all spoke perfect English. Flying Aerolineas was very much what it was like to fly domestic in Australia in the nineties - not great but bearable.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
I recently flew with AR on the new direct SYD-EZE service. I must say after reading the previous reviews here that I was pleasantly surprised. Flights were on time cabin crew were friendly (more so on the return leg) seat pitch in economy was actually very good cabin was clean and tidy. Yes there are no back of seat entertainment screens but for the price you cannot expect 5 star services. If being entertained is an issue bring your ipad or a good book! Food was OK. On the return flight after dinner service sandwiches were self- served from the rear of the cabin and it would be beneficial here to at least offer a selection (for us veggies rather than the ubiquitous ham and cheese). Overall the flight was as good as any for the price – in fact the worst part was actually going through customs at EZE  which took well over an hour. I thought I had landed at LAX! Overall I would recommend this airline if you are after a well-priced airfare – just don't expect 5 star amenities services for a 3 star price.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
I flew from Lima to Sydney via Buenos Aires. My flight in Buenos Aires was delayed 1.5 hours but Aerolineas did not communicate with us at all! They announced a couple of times in Spanish thank you for your patience but that was it. Finally when we boarded it took another hour to take off! The people on my flight were complaining of the terrible service they had already experienced with Aerolineas. When I arrived in Sydney I had missed my connecting flight and so had half of the passengers I was with. We all had to pay for new tickets to our next destination which cost me $170 to Melbourne! Their entertainment was poor they played the same movie over and over and when passengers asked for help staff ignored them! Pretty bad service is an understatement.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
SYD-EZE-SYD. Plane is an older A340-200 - without personal IFE - just a main screen. Economy class seats were generously sized and I was offered an emergency exit seat from SYD-EZE. EZE-SYD was a standard economy class seat. Plane departed on time from SYD-EZE and again EZE-SYD. Staff friendly and always walking around. Food was edible but there wasn't much of it. A small self-serve bar in the galley provided water and snacks during the flight. Both flights the plane landed on time and overall was a pleasant experience. Despite being limited in features I got from SYD to EZE and back cheaply comfortably and if you bring your iPad/iPod you'll be entertained. If there was no price difference between AR and LAN/Qantas etc. consider going on the latter. But AR isn't a bad airline provided you've got some personal entertainment on the long 13-15 hour flights. One final point - the AR website is incredibly hard to navigate and use. Calls to their SYD call centre go without answer.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Well after hearing a lots of negetive comments about Aerlineas airlines I was a bit apprehensive but the fare was almost half from MEL-RIO. I found the service better and aircraft was old but with more legroom. The crew was also good and trying to help passengers as it was a long flight of 16 hrs. Food was OK and they should improve their entertainment service. Overall we enjoyed and would definitely go again.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
They delayed my flight by 3 days and were incredibly rude and unapologetic. I was supposed to fly from Sydney to Buenos Aires via Auckland and Santiago. I turned up at the check in counter in Sydney and was told the flight would be delayed because the plane hadn't arrived yet from Auckland but it would only be a couple of hours. When I returned they said the plane would not be arriving after all and that we would not leave Sydney for another two days. Staff were rude and unhelpful and once we were taken to the accommodation we didn't hear from them again except for a piece of paper under the hotel door telling us to be ready at 5am. After two days we went back to airport there was no staff member there and we had to go from counter to counter trying to find out which flight we were on. After finally checking in and going through immigration we were at the boarding gate when we were told that we would not be flying out after all as there was no plane to meet us in Auckland. No staff representative. I ended up changing to LAN Chile who were excellent.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Return flight (Sydney-Buenos Aires). The fare was really competitive. Flight left on time from Sydney to Buenos Aires. Food was below average (Fish and rice for dinner and very small sandwiches for breakfast and middle snack). On board entertainment is the worst entertainment I have witnessed. Flight attendants were nice. On my way back flight delayed 30 minutes. Food was good (Chicken and rice for lunch. Croissant tea and fruits for breakfast and small chicken sandwich for middle snack). On board entertainment was better than the first flight. Pros: Excellent price - On time flights - Friendly staff. Cons: No personal entertainment nor good screens - Bad food on first flight - Staff didn't allow me to use my iphone in flight mode - not very tidy (though not dirty).

SYD-EZE on July 21. While the aircraft was old and it lacks personal inflight entertainment it was well maintained. Good legroom. Crew were friendly and efficient. Left on time and arrived one hour early. All and all a good experience and extremely good value for money. I'm looking forward to my return in a few days.

Flew AKL-EZE/AEP-GIG-AEP/EZE-AKL. Both long-haul legs were close to being on time but the baggage wait in BA was around 40 min (thus missed the transfer bus to the other airport in BA and had to get a cab). Upon arrival at AEP I was checked-in for the flight to Rio as normal. But 20 min after the schedule boarding time everyone was informed that AR decided to switch the departing airport back to EZE (and this is already at 10pm). So had to re-clear the custom collect our baggage wait for 30 min for the bus take the 1 hour bus ride to the other side of the town re-check in and re-clear the custom at EZE (which took 1 hour). Finally landed in Rio at 3.30am 4 hours late. No compensation was offered whatsoever. The return flights were relatively stress-free. Overall the cabin service was above average but planes are antiquated with no personal entertainment but a leaky roof. Breakfast on the 13 hour long-haul consisted of two pieces of cold bread and a banana. Much cheaper than LAN but definitely not worth the money paid.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Was booked on the flight on the 13th of July from EZE-SYD (which does not go via AKL anymore). I checked- in and everything was confirmed with my seat etc. I was at the airport at 6am for the 8.30am flight. After 1 hour in line I was only half way down the queue. A little bit later other passengers bound for SYD were denied access. The following reason was given: the weather pattern on the route to SYD. Therefore they had to get rid of weight to have a lighter aircraft to make it the entire way. Later we learnt that they had given freight/cargo priority and consequently 80 of us were stranded with the next flight due 3 days later which only had 40 free spots. The employees only spoke Spanish which was hard for people who didn't know the language. Lots of ideas were thrown around but evidently the flight left without us. I had checked the flight the days/weeks before I was due to fly it and noticed that the flight always left EZE delayed by 1-2 hours which could be for similar reasons. Maybe they should go back to flying via AKL to be able to accept all the paid passengers. Their compensation was not good either and I (and several others) decided we wanted a full refund.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
SYD-AKL-BA return. Very old aircraft untidy and looked quite dirty. No personal entertainment unit. Surly cabin crew with very poor service standards. Hardly saw FA's for the entire flight and no effort was made to prepare the cabin for landing. I also took an internal flight with this airline from BA to Ushuaia. On this flight the service was just as bad and my seat was broken. I will never use this airline again.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
We had a scheduled flight from AEP (Buenos Aires) to Resistencia. When we checked in we were told that the flight was on time. Just before boarding time we were told that the flight was cancelled. We were told that all flights were full for 3 days but they would work on something. Long story short we stayed overnight at the airport (with 5 children) and the next day we were flown to Corrientes instead of Resistencia. We received nothing in compensation - no vouchers for food hotel or transportation - and not for lack of persistent trying. We did not even receive transportation cost for travel from Corrientes to Resistencia! We would never recommend this airline.

Buenos Aires to Salta to Iguazu. Bit apprehensive after reading reviews but both flights were fine. Punctual efficient and even a decent snack. Both were on Embraer 190 operated by Austral and the second craft was new - excellent seats and seat-back IFE with personal headsets on a flight of less than 2 hours.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
I have flown a number of long distance and internal flights and am pleased with the airline. The international flight has the biggest leg room and is very comfortable. No TV's but not a problem - bring your own entertainment. Food is mediocre but drinks are served regularly. Internal flights are good - they new Embraers are great and the new B737's have suitable legroom. The Virgin sourced planes are tight in terms of legroom. The website is great and service when things go wrong is also friendly and good.

Business Class return Sydney to Sau Paulo. Great price but pretty basic for the class paid. Worst was the return trip my agent had booked the ticket and I hadn't noticed that the flight home via Buenos Aires landed and took off from different airports. I thought they would arrange transfers - wrong. After much complaining they arranged a transfer with another bus company. We were lucky but others (including a mother and small child) got no guidance and had to get taxi's.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Horrible food hot plane (and I feel the cold) seat didn't recline. No personal IFE had to watch a tiny screen at front of plane one movie wasn't in English. Didn't see staff much so couldn't get drinks. All flights delayed at both Auckland BA for 6 hrs each. Given measly meal voucher at BA that bought me nothing much. BA Airport was horrible and staff unhelpful. I had no personal effects for 24hrs once I arrived in Rio. I flew them to save $1000 over LAN Chile whom I will fly with next time and just spend the extra.

MIA-EZE round trip and AEP-UAQ. Service on the long haul was great from reservation process through check- in and inflight. Airbus 340 from and back to Miami had spacious economy class seats and attentive flight attendants. Onboard entertainment on the long haul was rudimentary at best and food was the worst airline food ever. Embraer 190 used on subsidiary Austral between AEP and UAQ was clean: spacious and had in- seat state of the art entertainment and refreshments. Had mobility issues and Aerolineas staff went the extra mile to take care of me. Favourable contrast in ground service with US carrier on arrival back to MIA was notable.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Salta to Mendoza on E190 and was impressed. On time newish and clean plane snack box with drink for short flight and even some seatback IFE was available. FA's were professional at all times but perhaps a little devoid of smiles.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Flew Sydney to BA via Auckland return plus BA to Lima return. Except for BA to Sydney no onboard entertainment and food inedible. Cabin temperature ranged from acceptable to unbearably hot. Service non existent. Flight from BA to Sydney both seats could not be reclined so spent 14 hours sitting upright with seats in front reclined. Managed to change seats in Auckland. Only positives were flights were close to being on time and baggage came with flights.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
First 6 hours into the flight from Argentina to Sydney - no food or drinks offered to passengers. Audio didn't work food was horrible lots of trays given back full. Staff had little or no courtesy bad movies with the TV screen flickering at all times.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Flew Aerolineas/Austral on a domestic flight AEP-IGR and I have nothing to complain about. Check-in was good. Fairly new planes (E190) with IFE even for this short flight of slightly less than 2 hours. Was served a sandwich and something to drink.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Flying on the now retired Boeing 474-400 from Buenos Aires to Madrid. Even though it didn't have an entertainment device (just an old 15" TV on the roof) the seats were really comfortable with good recline. Food wasn't bad and the service was extremely friendly and helpful. Flight delayed 30 mins but arrived on time. Return flight on the same aircraft.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
MAD-EZE return plus 6 internal flights. Seats a bit worn but everything else OK. Internal flights a nightmare due to constant delays and cancellations. Due to cancellation they paid for 2 free hotel nights + dinner. When we decided to skip one of our destinations there were no sales people available to make the change. The change was done by check-in staff who were very friendly but clueless. It turned out they forgot to delete the one leg thus the system counted us as no-show and cancelled our tickets for the flight back! Luckily the plane was half empty so they could re-activate the tickets at EZE.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Flight from Bariloche to Buenos Aires delayed 7 hours because of weather. We had a connection from BA to Iguazu that was missed despite airline staff at Bariloche airily dismissing our concerns. Staff did not communicate. The next day we flew to Iguaza with no food or drinks. Staff were hostile uncaring and rude. Planes are old and not very clean.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Miami to EZE. No online check-in or boarding pass. I had one carry on bag and they tried to make me check it. The plane seemed old the food was ok 2 movies on overhead monitors however my headset didn't work. Attendants were friendly hardly ever saw them except for the 2 "meals" no diet coke and no soft drinks available for breakfast. Landed 25 minutes late after a 9 hour flight with the announcement "another on-time arrival". Saying it doesn't make it so. I have to return on them but I'll not use them again.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
AEP-FTE in Club Economy. Check-in at AEP was confusing proceeded to departure lounge upstairs. There is no VIP saloon at this airport for Club Economy passengers. Equipment was an old MD88 that was worn. No IFE. Seat pitch was around 35” or so. A lunch box was distributed shortly after take off - a stale sandwich a packaged cake and a pack of nuts. Drink service followed and FA's disappeared. No second round of drinks. Toilet was dirty. For a 3 hour flight I would expect a more substantive meal in the “premium” cabin. My bags were amongst the last to come out despite marked “priority” on the tag.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Booked to fly Sydney to BA 1pm Tuesday it's now Friday and I've made it as far as Auckland. We sat all day at the gate in SYD eventually told flight cancelled due to mechanical problem. After spending 2 nights we left SYD last night only to land in Auckland for 16 hour layover due to crew shortages. No communication other than rumours from hotel staff. Airline had paid for accommodation and meals but very basic. No entertainment onboard other. Due to fly out 10pm tonight. Traveller beware.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
GIG through EZE to USH. Initial check-in took 20 mins per person only 2 people working huge lines. Flight delayed more than 4 hours. No updates from the airline board still read on time. Missed connection in Buenos Aires no Business Class line rep tells me she can't help me reschedule my flight. No offer of meal tickets no lounge access they bump me to economy class and refuse to refund the difference - finally part with a voucher for a disgusting fast food place at the airport then the flight to Ushuaia is delayed 2 hours. Everything was a hassle. The lounge at Rio airport is a marathon to get to and a joke once you're there.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
6 hours delay from Auckland to Buenos Aires and 5 hours delay from Buenos Aires to Auckland. Food was not good the seats were uncomfortable and the TV system rubbish. Staff were not friendly with little customer service skills.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
This airline has no check-in agreements with other airlines if transiting with another airline allow time to clear immigration customs collect bags re-check-in etc because they cannot do it for you. Auckland to BA - toilet out of order. Return flight 7 weeks later same toilet out of order. Ceiling mounted TV was flickering for 13 hours. Service - rude. Movies - they only had 2. They lied to us about how long our flight would be delayed so they wouldn't have to pay for meals and accommodation. When we returned to the airport we found it was further delayed. We paid for 7 flights with AA and they changed departure and arrival times on us and in BA also switched arriving airports which meant we had to cross town to make our connecting flight. Don't order the special meals.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
My flight from Sydney to São Paulo was cancelled and they called me to say they were having problems and if they could change my itinerary. They arranged everything for me with Emirates. My flight back to Australia was ok no delay. The food isn't good. No TVs but it is not a problem if you have magazines and books. The seats are not comfortable. The price is good however staff don't speak English very well. The check-in was very slow it took nearly 2 hours. Recommended if you to want save money.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Flew twice on domestic flights in Argentina and despite all the bad reviews these flights were excellent on time and without any issues. One was operated by Austral on a new airplane which had comfortable seats with IFE in back seat. I may have been lucky but I can recommend them for domestic flights.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
2 hour delay leaving Sao Paulo a further 3 hour delay in the transit lounge at Buenos Aires. No information about this delay. No announcements no staff to get information. The screen simply said 'Delayed'. After 2 hours a garbled message in Spanish was given to take boarding passes to a cafe and get something to eat. I pre-booked vegetarian meals months ahead and confirmed at check-in 3 hours prior to departure. But my name was not on list. The plane was old with poor TV and disappearing staff. This airline runs a good domestic service. Messages in English to a predominantly English speaking transit lounge would be a basic and obvious service.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Buenos Aires to Salta to Iguazu. Both flights were fine. Punctual efficient and a decent snack. Both were on Embraer 190 operated by Austral and the second craft was new - excellent seats and seat-back IFE with personal headsets on a flight of less than 2 hours.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
MAD-EZE-MAD. The airplane is an old 747 that it seems to be torn to pieces. You have great room for your legs while seated in those old cradles. There are rather comfortable though. Inflight entertainment does not work in 50% of the seats and flight attendants will never give you a proper solution. Food is ok but there's not much to choose but wines are superb.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
AEP-USH. The departure time and flight number were different on the e-ticket boarding card and departure screen. Nobody could provide an explanation but in the end that didn't matter as it was 4-5 hours late depending on which time you chose. The aircraft was an elderly MD88 with no APU working hence the interior was stifling when we boarded. Leg room was appalling. The "snack" was inedible and the coffee undrinkable. To cap it all one bag was lost for 4 days.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Sydney to Buenos Aires with AL return a disappointing experience. Both flights left an hour late without explanation. When we booked flights in Australia we chose our seats and our choice apparently accepted. We reconfirmed this at check-in but upon entering the aircraft we discovered this not to be the case and we were not even sitting together. On the first flight the audio did not work on my seat and on the other the visuals were running without audio. Staff tried to speak English but generally had a poor capability so communicating in Spanish was more effective. Some staff were unfriendly and all staff disappeared for about five hours after serving the meal on leaving BA. Snacks and drinks were available in the galley areas but this was not announced so passengers only found out about it through diffusion. We flew a number of internal flights with LAN which is worlds ahead of AL on service.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Auckland-Buenos Aires return on A340. Both flights were delayed no reason was given as to why; communication would have been appreciated. There was a single screen for entertainment but no headphones were passed out during one flight until the movie had run! The movies were old. The food was decidedly average. The plane fittings appeared old - my seat bottom was entirely loose from its frame and two of the bathroom doors I used wouldn't close properly. The toilets were not serviced at all during the long 12 hours flights so they were pretty horrible by the end. The crew were friendly and bilingual but once meals were served they did not really appears. I wouldn't seek to fly with this airline again unless there were no other options. I had an internal flight in Argentina on LAN Chile and they appeared to be a more polished act.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
I am not looking forward to my return flight from Australia to NZ. Delayed 6 hours with no explanation dirty trays chewing gum on the arm rests. The flight crew sat in the departure gate and took up two rows of seats while we all stood. An overhead TV that didn't work and a loud speaker that was so loud we had our fingers in our ears. Nothing impressive here.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
I have flown with Aerolineas about 6 times over the last 4/5 years. Every single flight was either cancelled or delayed. The staff are generally not that bad and they take a lot of stick from people. Food no real issues. The flights themselves are just so unreliable.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
I took two intercontinental flights (MAD-EZE and back) and six internal flights with Aerolineas. All eight flights were more or less on time the planes were clean and baggage always arrived without delay but service on all flights was poor and food all but inedible. There is a difference between the internal and the intercontinental flights however: the cabin crews on internal flights were just indifferent and bored on the intercontinental flights they were rude and in some instances overtly hostile. Ground staff generally falls into the category "indifferent" with a few positive exceptions. Conclusion: Try avoiding Aerolineas for intercontinental flights but for internal flights it's ok.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
IGR to AEP. Flight was showing delayed on the airport website still on time on the AR website. Unable to process web check-in. Complete chaos at the airport since the previous flight had been cancelled and the flight after ours was also cancelled. Not a single AR check-in staff or management available. After one hour of waiting with no announcement in English or Spanish or any AR check-in staff in sight we decided to take an 18 hours bus ride to ensure we get to BEU on time for our flight back to Canada the next day.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
AEP to SLA. Initially scheduled for departure at 18.05. Delayed various times until finally dropped from the monitor after midnight. Flight was cancelled no announcements in English very few announcements in Spanish. Misleading information about new flight the next morning initial departure at 06.30 from AEP then at 09.30 from EZE final departure ex AEP at 09.30. Only compensation for the 16 hours delay a dry piece of pizza and a can of Sprite. Flight was an old B737-500 despite the rebooking we were on standby for this flight and got the last seats on the aircraft.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
The planes left on time and arrived on time seats and legroom are good. A340's don't have entertainment main cabin TV screens are old. Air hostess hide once they serve you you hardly see them - they disappear. This is poor as people have to go and ask for water etc it becomes a kind of self serve Airline. For the price is good.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Auckland-Buenos Aires. Pleased about the leg room however their flights late or just cancelled for no reason. The food was ok hostesses were direct with them wanting to give you hot drinks cold drinks or snacks. Check-in took 1 hr 40 mins so be prepared.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Buenos Aires-Iguazu Falls return. Two good flights the first on a Boeing 737-700 departed 10 mins early and arrived 15 mins early. Flight service is efficient and cabin crew friendly. The return flight on an MD-88 old but in good condition quiet and comfortable with a friendly and helpful cabin crew with the flight arriving at Aeroparque (AEP) 10 mins early.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Salta-Puerto Iguazu domestic flight operated by Austral. Flight a Embraer 190 with personal entertainment with TV series and documentaries and some CD's. The entertainment system failed twice but the crew reactivated it quick. Did not expected entertainment on a domestic flight. The crew offered a sandwich with a drink. Good legroom at emergency exit but the normal seats also offered good legroom for this short flight of 1.5 hrs. Departed 2O mins early and landed 40 mins early in Iguazu.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Buenos Aires-Madrid. Staff were helpful and friendly. Seats comfortable but there is no onboard entertainment and the plane was old.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Three days of delay (Buenos Aires-Madrid). The aircraft is in poor condition and the airline personnel are not helpful. They won't even give passengers an explanation for the delay and told us to file our complaints online.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Ezeiza to Iguazu the plane was quite new a 737-700. No delay at all the flight was nice although no headphones were given. Seats are comfortable for such a small flight 1.45 hrs.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Montevideo to Buenos Aires. Delay of about 2 hours for a flight that lasted 45 mins. saw the plane. No crew member or agent to ask for information. On board the crew were not attentive and paid little attention to passengers.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Buenos Aires to Ushuaia return. I flew from Ushuaia back to Buenos Aires and it was absolute chaos. The previous 2 days flights had been cancelled due to Chile Volcano the airport was full of people and there was no organisation or communication for waiting passengers. There were lots of angry passengers a TV crew and lots of police but a lack of Aerolineas staff.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Sydney to Buenos Aires and had heard all the stories so I was prepared when there was an 8 hr delay in Auckland and for the broken seat and dodgy entertainment. But the price difference compared to other airlines more then made up for it. Foods was ok and the staff were good and if your prepared with a book then this is good value. Because the planes are older there is actually pretty good leg room in Economy. On my return I'd been travelling for 32hrs and they gave me an unexplained upgrade to Business Class. I was finally able to sleep and the service from the crew were great.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Flight was cancelled from Sydney to Auckland on July 28. I knew this as had checked on internet. However when I tried to ring I got cut off 4 times before finally talking to someone. When we finally got to the airport the boy I was travelling with was 'on the list' but I wasn't and was touch an go as to whether I would get a flight at all. All ended well as we finally both got back to NZ even though we were put on different flights. I felt sorry for the staff in Sydney understaffed and under a lot of stress but they were polite and as helpful as possible.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
New Zealand to Buenos Aires. They cancelled our flights and had wait hours in Argentina. The crew were not polite they did not provide accommodation and did not listen to our complaints. I needed to call to New Zealand to get someone from Aerolineas to answer my queries.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Rude Staff old aircraft Lost our bags but didn't care why. We were left in New Zealand and passengers weren't advised of new flight time on different airline - the whole team disappeared from airport and left passengers wondering what to do. We had to pay $100 to get our bags to Sydney with Air NZ because they have a different baggage allowance. Little customer service skills.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Santiago-Buenos Aires-Rome and back. The planes are evidently old and the entertainment system is very mediocre especially for a 13+ hr trip. The food given was good enough and the crew was nice although they didn't offer anything unless you asked them. The biggest problem was the schedule on my return flights the plane from Rome to Buenos Aires was delayed 6 hrs we had to wait 6 more hrs in Buenos Aires to get back on a plane to Santiago (delayed an extra hour). They were good enough to move me and my sister to Business Class from Rome to Buenos Aires because of the problems although this was possible only because my dad and uncle were in Business already. Business class didn't offer many improvements in comparison to other airlines the seats although more comfortable than the Economy ones weren't as good as other airlines and the entertainment system was almost the same as in Economy.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
I have travelled many times with this airline and have not had any problems. However I am disgusted with the way that the airline has handled the problem with the Volcano in Chile. I understand that flights need to be cancelled but Aerolineas is not communicating with its passengers and is also not making any attempts to help those trapped in Argentina due to flight cancellations. The staff were very rude even getting up and walking away. It is such a disappointment to see the way that passengers are being treated. Those of us trying to reschedule our flights are having problems getting through to the call centre. Very unprofessional.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
There seems to be a polarity of views on AR between Australia/New Zealand based travellers and those who use AR regularly for domestic and regional services. It may be the case that both are right but for fairness I have to say that in 15 yrs of domestic flights and regional services to/from Brazil and Paraguay I have never experienced more than 30 mins delay and have always received good service in Economy class.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
I have travelled several times with Aerolineas. Buenos Aires-Rio De Janeiro and Montevideo. Domestically I have flown between Buenos Aires and Mendoza Cordoba and Salta. I only have praise for the staff and organisation of this airline. I have encountered polite efficiency from check in staff and air crew the aircraft were clean and I experienced no delay or problems with the flights.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
This is by far the worst airline. Rude staff most dilapidated aircraft and 13 hours late - need I go on. Cheap rates but not cheap enough.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
During our holiday in Argentina we were unlucky to have several flights with Aerolineas Argentinas. They are by far the worst airline I have experienced. It is a very poorly run state owned airline acting like a monopolist. Customers are treated like dirt. Staff at check in is rude (Puerto Iguazu was the only exception). Flights are nearly always delayed without any explanation given or sometimes cancelled altogether. Even worse some of its planes are in very poor condition and seem utterly unsafe. Follow the advice of some Argentinians I met : always avoid them. It is better to spend 24 hours in a bus (they are very comfortable) than 2 hours with Aerolineas.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
The food was basic but acceptable. Astonished by rudeness of the cabin crew no service at all we were not greeted on the aircraft or off. Crew ignored our need for a glass of water my seat was broken no film or music for a 4 hour flight.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
AEP to Calafate Calafate to Ushuaia: Ushuaia to AEP. I was surprised at the overall quality of the Aerolineas Argentinas operations : online check-in inflight service from friendly and professional crew and the snacks including the quick Calafate to Ushuaia hop. The radar went down at Ushuaia and AR sent three bus loads of passengers on a four hour bus ride to Rio Grande through a heavy mountain snow. As the buses arrived in Rio Grande the Aerolineas Argentinas flight landed and a completely full flight was airborne for AEP in less than an hour.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
We spent 4 weeks in Argentina and took 5 flights with is airline. In this time they lost my baggage for two days cancelled one flight with no previous notice delayed two times and worst of all the last airplane we took tried to depart and stop last minute twice due to technical difficulties. We had to wait for 24 hrs for them to fix it and lost our connections to Mexico. The company refused to assist us to solve any problem and kept saying : there's nothing we can do present your claim on line. I will never flight with Aerolíneas Argentinas again!

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Aeroparque-Montevideo return  4 people at the check-in 2 of them working. The rest doing everything to avoid the customer. Although arriving 2h before departure we almost missed our flight. The queue became so long that locals started fighting with the personnel since they lost their flights due to Aerolineas Argentinas "I dont care attitude". Service onboard is a plastic bag with juice and a fruit-bar. Flight attendants friendly. A country like Argentina does deserve a better airline.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
EZE to Santa Cruz. Everything was fine - no queue to check in flight was on time decent snack on board and aircraft reasonably new. So nothing special but nothing to complain about either.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Flight suspended in Aukland for 24hrs due to an industrial dispute (they told us it was due to an engineering issue but we found out later this was a lie). Although we were put up in a hotel room it still lost us one day out of 10 of our hard saved visit to relatives. Waited in Auckland airport for 8 hrs before they ferried us out to hotel - dinner at 3am and had to be awake by 8 to go again (we had kids with us). Flight home was delayed again at Argentina (captain turned up 2 hours late).

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
MAD-EZE return. On the upper deck on the way to Argentina: service was good food as well - seat worked and slept nearly the whole flight. On the way back on the much smaller lower deck flight attendant was somewhat short-sighted and set everyone in wrong seats - we had our laughs. Seat was a bit broken but found some sleep. Food wasn't so good on the flight back to Europe.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Came To Argentina for vacations. The first flight (Bogota to Buenos Aires) suffered a 12 hour delay four internal flights in Argentine were all delayed (hours of delay) and the last one (Iguazu to Buenos Aires) was cancelled! They took us to a filthy hotel in Iguazu. With these problems it is not worth to talk about service or food.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
I've flown from Auckland to Sao Paulo and return twice with this airline over the last four years - best thing is the price. Food acceptable - I'm not fussy about food. Staff inclined to be offhand and more interested in socialising among themselves. Announcements very thickly accented English - difficult to comprehend at times. Cabin interior - on my first trip the reading light came away in my hand and the projected movie seemed to have been soaked in bleach before screening. On the second trip there was no film at all with no explanation or apology from the crew. Lateness - first trip OK. Second trip a shocker. Six-hour delay in leaving due to unspecified technical difficulties. On late arrival in Buenos Aires confusion reigned with passengers asking each other what was going on as most connections had been missed. By a mysterious process (no thanks to the airline's staff) I found myself on a coach with other mystified passengers thinking we were heading to a hotel for the night (it was very late). Instead we were taken to another airport and hastily put aboard another plane. I got to Brazil but landed in the wee small hours and faced an uncomfortable night sleeping on the floor of the terminal. Aerolineas thereby escaped having to foot the bill for hotel rooms.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
AEP-FTE via Ushuaia check in chaotic use web check in! New B737-700 nice crew on both legs drinks and food service (cakes cereal bar) nice flight on time arrival. Surprised reading other reviews or lucky. Price for internal flights quite high.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Last minute surprise cancellations and huge delays are routine in Aerolineas Argentinas. My short vacation last long weekend was ruined by this airline. Both flights BUE-COR and return COR-BUE were cancelled. In the first I returned to fly next day. In the second (COR-BUE) they sent me by bus (800km). Check with a knowledgeable and honest travel agent before becoming their hostage.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Flew 4 legs from Santiago to Iguazu. First one cancelled and we took next flight 3 hours later. Second one was delayed. The same with third flight. The last one also delayed before we could board and once onboard we had to stay sitting in the plane at Buenos Aires airport for more than an hour in a very warm day.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
EZE-COR and back new Austral E-190 with good legroom and interesting IFE. The flight is only an hour long so I wasn't expecting food the snack provided was decent. Used the web check-in so airports were a breeze. The staff and cabin crew was friendly and energetic. However they still have punctuality issues: both my flights were 30 minutes late and screens at the airport showed that many of their flights were delayed too.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
We have scheduled to fly 6 legs on this airline and unfortunately have flown 7. Five flights were delayed by over an hour and delays averaged 2 hours late. Each time the website reported an on-time takeoff when we checked prior to departing for the airport. The last time we flew this airline we checked the status prior to departure and it stated "on-time" for our flight from AEP to GIG. When we arrived at the airport the screens stated "on-time" finally after an hour in a line that did not move we noticed a crowd at one ticket counter and went to investigate. Our flight had been cancelled without an announcement. They rebooked us for a flight that left from a different airport and that took a detour through Sao Paulo. Our more expensive direct flight from AEP to GIG turned into a 13 hour marathon with us arriving in Rio de Janeiro seven hours late at 2:30 am in the morning. I will not fly this airline again.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Flew domestic with Aerolineas Argentinas on 5 occasions in the space of 3 weeks. Flight length was between 2 and 3hours each time. On every occasion the flight departure was at least 45mins or more delayed. Planes were generally older (late 80's early 90's) MD-90's. Inflight entertainment is non existent and the food served well below average. The problem in Argentina is that apart from the occasional LAN route Aerolineas sit on the whole domestic market so there is generally no choice of carrier.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
I had the misfortune to fly this airline Sydney to Buenos Aires landed in Auckland where the plane had a mechanical problem no communication left waiting at the airport for hours before our tour guide got them to provide accommodation for the night. The plane we flew was very old had no inflight entertainment and the crew were rude. The flight crew left the seat belt sign on for most of the flight. My advice - give them a wide berth.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
Terrible experience - we flew Buenos Aires to Ushuaia and returned 3 weeks later. Both time the flight was delayed by 5 hours. They seem to cancel flights until the plane is full and then let it go. Cabin staff and ground staff could not care less a very poor attitude. Horror stories from many other passengers about lost luggage. I would avoid using them at all cost.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
AKL-SYD one way. I booked this flight with pretty low expectations. The flight was 90 minutes late. However this flight was better than expected. A340s used on this route are old. However the seats were comfortable and leg room acceptable. The complimentary light meal coffee and juice were tasty and appreciated. The cabin crew's English was quite good - some of the crew were young and friendly while there were a couple of more experienced and more gruff senior crew who shouted orders. All PAs are given in Spanish first then English. It was very hard to understand the English notices as the English spoken was heavily accented. There are no personal TVs and on this three hour sector no movies were shown - just the route map on the main screens. Their service is significantly lower quality than their main competitor LAN but they are also significantly cheaper. I think it would be less comfortable to fly the much longer AKL-EZE sector on this airline but for AKL-SYD they were fine.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
MAD to BUE and back in economy class. B747-400 used were really old no personal screens in the seatbacks only small ceiling screens. Furthermore on MAD-BUE flight the inflight entertainment system gave up working shortly after the safety movie so no movie or Airshow at all. Meal/drink service was absolutely minimal no drinks at all during both 12h night flights. Cabin announcements unmotivated and in bad English. The old fashioned seats were very comfortable. great legrooom and recline. Bring your own food drinks and entertainment don't expect anything special from the cabin crew but enjoy the comfy seats which are much better than those ultra-thin seats which most leading carriers offer today.

SYD to EZE via AKL EZE-BOG via LIM and return. Arrived at Sydney airport at 7am for a morning departure to be told flight will be delayed until afternoon. Provided with a lunch voucher I spent the day at Sydney airport flight finally departed at around 1730. Arriving late to EZE I had missed my prebooked hotel shuttle and complained at the airline counter and they gave me a voucher for a hire car to my hotel which was nice. A340 was old seats were well worn and frayed overhead reading lights didn't work overhead baggage lockers difficult to close ancient entertainment system with flickering screen. Food was passable but nothing special cabin crew looked old and tired and mostly stayed in the galley chatting amongst themselves and were not very attentive. The pillow was so small and flat it was a waste of time as was the small think blanket. Every other flight I had within South America with this airline was very late causing inconvenience and disruption to my travel plans. My return flight to Australia was cancelled and I was driven to a hotel and picked up by bus the next morning only to face more delays uncertainty and poor communication from airline staff. This airline is a joke listen to me and many other people here when we say pay the extra money and fly to South America with LAN or Qantas but avoid Aerolineas Argentinas like the plague.

ASU-AEP morning flight on time clean and professional. Not many flights between Paraguay and Argentina and this one went into the city airport Aeroparque saving a lot of time.

Auckland to Sydney. On the way there flight was delayed almost two hours. Staff were rude requested a bassinet for my 3 month old When boarded plane was told there was nothing? Flight home delayed two hours again no bassinet. Staff did not smile when needed pressed the button and waited 20 minutes?

Plane from Auckland to Buenos Aires was old pocket at back of seat was split so mags etc kept falling out seats frayed and the nearest movie screen didn't work. Inflight service OK there doesn't seem to be a choice of meal and it is just plonked in front of one. But had plenty of room as plane was only half full. Return trip from Montivideo was hours late leaving for Buenos Aires. I had to take a bus to the international airport but as it wouldn't have arrived there till 0100 I had to take a car (shared with another traveller) for the 0200 flight which left at 0430! Plane was better than the first as everything seemed to work. Cabin staff do their job but not so friendly as other air lines. Lights out after dinner and don't see cabin staff much after that but there is water and drinks left in the galley area. Plane late into Auckland so therefore missed connection to Christchurch and had to buy another ticket as I had just got a non transferable thinking 3 hours between flights would be long enough. Air fare was about half the price of the other airline servicing that route. Not sure if I will use them again. Have to be aware of delays and we were not given any explanation as to why it was delayed.

BUE to MVD so very short flight. Excellent service very friendly staff. Even got a snack in a handy plastic bag to reuse at security next time - nice idea. On return from Montevideo arrived to check in and was offered a seat on a flight leaving one hour earlier. So great experience. Only negative was very complicated booking process. Booked online but then had to call the office here in France to make payment. Not possible either online or through Buenos Aires call centre. Very strange.

BOG to EZE on a relatively new 737. Flight left on time food decent (two services on this 6 hour flight lunch and snack before landing) although the main lunch was pretty small and all types of drinks free. This airline has a pretty bad reputation for being late but it seems they are buying new planes and things are getting slowly better. For me it was all I could ask for - cheap nonstop and good service. The only change would be to have some sort of in flight entertainment.

Buenos Aires to Bariloche return and found both the airplane comfortable and the crew very attentive. The snack and beverage services were nice too. There was a delay in the departure from Bariloche to Buenos Aires which seems to be usual in Aerolineas Argentinas. It is said that many passengers choose some other airlines instead of Aerolineas because of the habitual delays. I hope it will become more efficient and competitive in time.

Buenos Aires to Madrid - flight delayed 9 hours. Then 15 days later I flew from Rome to Buenos Aires the flight was again delayed 10 hours.

SYD-AKL return. Staff pleasant and polite. Food edible if you are hungry. A good budget airline seats in good condition and comfortable. Only downside would be no in flight entertainment. It wouldn't kill them to put on a movie especially during school holidays.

Buenos Aires to Calafate economy class. Food and drinks were reasonable. Cabin interior was clean. On return the aircraft was MD80 legroom reasonable but as no entertainment service on this 3 hour flight.

### Aerolineas Argentinas customer review
We flew to and from Madrid and we left and arrived on time. Both trips take about 11 hours and the experience was good. The seat is confortable though it is not a flat bed and the food was good. The plane was a rather old B747.

Sydney to Auckland. No inflight entertainment just a snack and drinks service and good legroom which Aerolineas have on the A340. Friendly and engaging crew. Overall a good flight and very cheap ticket.

Sao Paulo to Buenos Aires. Aerolineas Argentinas now offers service to Aeroparque which is more convenient than Ezeiza. We bought business class tickets. Check-in staff at GRU tells us that aircraft assigned to flight has all-coach cabin offers refund. Same happens on the way back. Strong suggestion that Aerolineas Argentinas is selling tickets to non-existent business class seats.

Buenos Aires to Sydney via Auckland. Staff were efficient and friendly enough. The food was fine leg room pretty good. Buenos Aires to Auckland after dinner the lights go off and you do not see the staff often after that but water was left out on the tray. TVs only in the centre aisle but audio was in English. Blankets and pillows on the seat. The plane had been around for years though. A negative is at the boarding lounge gate you handheld baggage is searched and they took all my wife's makeup and threw it away they should have provided plastic bags because it needed to be in an individual bag and she was very upset about this.

Auckland to Buenos Aires. Plane was delayed by five hours after we'd checked in with pretty much no explanation (except that the incoming plane from Sydney was delayed but again no explanation why). We were travelling with two young children so the delays were a bit difficult. Legroom was pretty much as I remember other airlines in economy class. The lack of decent entertainment was a pain (only the old monitors up in the aisles where you had to crane your neck to see) but the kids ended up falling asleep anyway. And the movie they played was in Spanish. Dinner was acceptable. Kids had a kids meal as requested. It was disappointing there was no beverage service during the night for those who were awake. I went hunting for a drink of water hoping they'd give me a bottle to tide me over but no just a cup. Having said all that the staff were reasonably friendly and the fare was much cheaper. It saved us around $1200 as a family. So if you don't mind no-frills it's not a bad choice. The domestic leg from Buenos Aires to Lima was on time and efficient.
