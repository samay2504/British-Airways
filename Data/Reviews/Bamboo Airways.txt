### "Never buy from this company"
The worst Ho Chi Minh City - Con Dao IslandsDomestic If you want to ruin your vacation, this is your company. Do not buy from this company. They are unprofessional. We had flights from Ho Chi Minh to Con Dao booked 6 months ago. They cancelled the flights and nobody told us. The company insists that I sent an email that I never received. In fact, if they had cancelled, they would have refunded my money. They have NOT refunded my money. Not only have they kept our money. If not, they will ruin our vacation. We have had to pay for flights with another company so as not to lose the hotel in Con Dao and of course the return to Hanoi. The company washes its hands. They only give you a contact email. And they have not refunded our money, supposedly months after their supposed cancellation. Never buy from this company or trust them. Lo peor Ho Chi Minh City - Con Dao IslandsDomestic Si queréis arruinar tus vacaciones esta es tu compañía. No compréis con esta compañía. Son unos informales. Teníamos reservados unos vuelos de Ho chi Minh a con Dao desde hacía 6 meses. Cancelaron los vuelos y nadie nos avisó. La compañía insiste en que mando un email que jamás recibí. De echo si hubieran cancelado me hubieran devuelto el dinero. NO me han devuelto el dinero. No sólo se han quedado con nuestro dinero. Si no nos arruinan una vacaciones. Hemos tenido que pagar vuelos en otra compañía para no perder el hotel en con Dao y por su puesto la vuelta a Hanoi. La compañía se limpia las manos. Tan solo te dan un email de contacto. Y no nos han devuelto el dinero, supuestamente meses después de su supuesta cancelación. Jamás compréis con esta compañía ni confíes en ellos

### "still no trace of any refund"
It's been a full year since my flight was cancelled and was promised a full refund. I have received numerous confirmations that my claim was forwarded to the Accounting department, but still no trace of any refund. Just save yourself energy and time and avoid them at all costs. An incompetent customer service that can't do their job right.

### "It's ridiculous"
Not Verified |   Embarrassing! We booked flights months ago that were canceled. I'm still chasing after Bamboo's incompetence today. Only because I went to the counter in Saigon was I refunded one reservation, not both. It's ridiculous and I can only advise anyone not to be tempted by supposedly low prices.

### "Avoid Bamboo Airways at all costs"
Not Verified |  Avoid Bamboo Airways at all costs! They cancelled my flight in August and owe me over £400 in refunds. Despite chasing them weekly for seven months, they've failed to reimburse me. Terrible service and total disregard for customers. Steer clear

### "lack of a reimbursement is outrageous"
Booked an international round trip ticket with direct flights between Frankfurt and Saigon with flights to Vietnam on 14 December and flights back booked for 18 January. Then we were informed in November that Bamboo Airways had cancelled our trip as a result of an internal restructuring of the company, with the promise that the money we had paid for our tickets back in April 2023 would be fully refunded. In mid-December, we received an email saying that our refund had been processed but now, 2.5 months later, we are still waiting for our money to be reimbursed. We have emailed Bamboo numerous times but have only ever received automated messages. Attempts to call the phone hotline have also been in vain. The number no longer seems to be in service. This lack of contact and lack of a reimbursement is outrageous. Please, Bamboo Airways, do the right thing: don't ignore your customers who booked with you in good faith. Get in touch and make good on your promise to reimburse our money.

### “I regret having booked with them”
I booked a flight on 07.10.2023 for 15.11.2023. On 30.10.2023, they decided to cancel without offering me an alternative flight. I had to struggle till 06.11.2023 through their non responsive helpdesk and messenger to get my request for a refund acknowledged. According to their internal rules, they gave themselves generously a staggering 90 days period to refund to the original payment method. Now it is over 94 days since their acknowledgement and over 100 days since they canceled, and they gave nothing. They didn't bother to reply neither to my requests nor to my emails. Everywhere you look in tripadvisor and trustpilot, people got the same hassle and couldn't recover their money. I regret having booked with them.

### "Staff were polite and attentive"
I was sceptical after reading the reviews but I could not be happier with the flight. Staff were polite and attentive, left on time and landed 20 mins earlier. Airplane was new and very clean. I will use them again. Only issue I had is the website that shows I know errors and had to call to ask for clarifications and also to receive the confirmation email.

### "Everything was faultless"
Impressed. Booked a domestic hop at last minute. Much cheaper than it’s competitors. Had my flight cancelled from LGW to HAN earlier this month, I expected the airline to be unreliable/late, how very wrong I was. Everything was faultless, check in was smooth, boarding and departure on time, crew very courteous and polite. Arrived safely and out of the airport in less than 10 min. Overall, given a chance, Bamboo would be my airline of choice while travelling around Asia.

### "I might fly this airline again"
Da Nang to Da Lat. The checkout process was smooth. Although there was a 25 minutes delay due to the late arrival of the airplane, once we boarded everything went on well. The legroom was not that cramped. I found the crew service even better than Vietnam Airlines flight I flew to Da Nang several days before. So, I might fly this airline again on my future visit to Vietnam.

### "Never will I fly with Bamboo Airways"
They misplaced our luggage on our flight to HCMC from Melbourne. We were without the luggage for the entire trip of 8 days and there was no earnest attempt made to locate and deliver our luggage in the next available flight. Instead they decided to keep the luggage in Melbourne to save them the transportation costs. In spite of several emails, I did not receive any communication until the last day of my return. For all the inconvenience and additional expenses incurred on the essentials, we were offered a paltry compensation of $60. It was more an insult than a compensation and hence, I did not accept the compensation. Apparently, that is their policy. As per Montreal convention, which Vietnam is part of, airlines are required to compensate customers for baggage delays with up to $1700 USD. They are misleading people stating that their company policy allows them to compensate up to a maximum of $30 only. They turned our holiday into a nightmare as we had to shop for essentials including basic clothes for three of us, which included a 3 year old toddler. We spent over $1700 in essentials and $60 does not even remotely make up for it. Imagine spending time shopping in an alien country with a toddler when we should have been enjoying our holiday. Not just money but I Iost precious time because of this airlines. Never will I fly with Bamboo Airways.

### "flights were fantastic"
Not Verified |  I travelled via Bamboo Airways to Ho Chi Minh on 3rd May 2023 and returned to the UK on 23rd May 2023. The flights were fantastic, the crew were very friendly and helpful. No complaints whats so ever. Would definitely fly Bamboo Airways again.

### "a very pleasant experience"
A superior Business Class product and very reasonably priced, far cheaper than Vietnam Airlines. Direct flight over was delayed, poorly handled at the gate but well handled by the pilot. Return flight arrived early. The seat is an Aerospatiale-designed pod available on many airlines in a 1-2-1 reverse-herringbone configuration. Extremely comfortable with lots of storage and a lie-flat 6'6" bed, and large television screen. Not a vast selection of movies or television to watch but adequate. Staff beautifully groomed and service delivered graciously and professionally. My request for the bed to be made up was immediately attended to. The return flight included a five-course dinner and later a breakfast of eggs benedict, perfectly cooked. Not a huge wine selection but perfectly adequate. The windows were dimmed - a feature of the 787 - on the outbound day flight, which was a tad discomforting as there was no need to sleep. Luggage awaiting on the carousel on arrival both flights. Overall, a very pleasant experience from a relative newcomer to international aviation.

### "they are not prepared"
Not Verified |  This was my first flight that I used Bamboo Airways and definitely my last. I don't think they are ready for international flights. Everything went wrong because they are not prepared, with only 4 check in staff for an aircraft that size. They could hardly check everyone on time and insult to injury the system broke down as I was checking in. The worst nightmare was going to immigration and security. If they had not helped me to priority exit, I would have had to wait at least over an hour with the amount of passengers lining up. They denied 5 hours to check all passengers and go through Immigration and security.

### "budget friendly prices"
Bamboo Airways delivers unparalleled value and service. With 20kg check in and onboard hot meals, Bamboo provides a full service experience with budget friendly prices. The only minor complaint I have is that on most of the short-mid routes, the planes vary between new planes and older planes. This is given that since majority of their fleet are leased planes, so unless you fly the B787 expect the A320s to have inconsistent interiors.

### "all the mod cons you expect"
Had a second great flight on Bamboo from Hanoi to Gatwick. On time, new Boeing 787 with all the mod cons you expect and fantastic service. Food was good, maybe not emirates standard, but attention from the crew throughout was outstanding. Check in swift and easy and priority bags delivered very promptly at Gatwick. Would definitely recommend them as great value for money.

### "the worst business class experience"
This is by far the worst business class experience I have ever had. On checking at Singapore, I was told I can only check in for the first leg of my trip and my bags would not be checked through. Ok So what happens then, They check you in and you are expected to go through immigration, pick up your bags and re-check in, that would be great if you had a visa. I was stopped from going through immigration and told to go to the transit counter. At the transit counter, I was told, we can get your bags but we can't check you in for 7 hours (layover was 10 hours ) so you will have to wait in the immigration hall, with no seats, no shops, just a room with 10 or so immigration desks, Upon some back and fro with the agent they made a call and said ok ok you only need to wait for 3 hours. Are you kidding me, I did not pay for a self-transfer ticket nor did I pay to stand in a hallway for 3 hours. After more time talking with the supervisor I was told we will check you in, Given a boarding pass, I said what about my bags. We will come and give you a baggage receipt later. Enter the lounge stay there for a few hours, Then told you must leave or pay 45 USD if you want to stay, So I paid as I wanted a shower and had 4 hours left on my Layover. The flight was ok - service standard. My advice do not use this airline if you are a business traveler, Vietnam airlines is far better and worth the extra 200 bucks -

### "I won’t be flying Bamboo ever again"
Not Verified |  45 minutes into boarding they turn off the screens so you can’t watch or listen to anything, they do the same 45 minutes before landing. The head phones are extremely uncomfortable. The food is terrible. I won’t be flying Bamboo ever again! It was uncomfortable, the seat wouldn’t go back, the seat in front of me was broken and hanging where my feet were.

### "reject children and elders to go to Priority"
Everything is perfect for an economy airline, it's much better than Vietnam Airlines by service, flight attendants, and seat quality. Food was served 3 times. In Australia, and Sydney particularly, everyone including the government care very much for elder and young children, they even have special quick line in Custom-service for elder and children. But, when checkin with Bamboo Airways in Sydney, the head manager reject children and elders to go to Priority line, claiming that "if the flight have 150 children, then we have to serve you all in this priority line"! This is what he had to say about that, while we have a 12 months old crying on our lap.

### "A valuable carrier!"
A valuable carrier! Good legroom! A very good one. I took a 1 hr flight so I cannot really review the service. Over all was okay. Boarding was fast and efficient. Nice gesture of having a usb port for the economy seats.

### "Would not recommend this airline"
Would not recommend this airline to anyone. Firstly, my luggage was lost when flying from the UK to Vietnam, and the airline was not helpful in keeping me updated on the progress locating my luggage. I finally received it about four days after initially landing in Hanoi, and was told that I would be eligible for $30 compensation as I needed to purchase essential items that were in my checked luggage. (The price of these exceeded $30, even for essential toiletries, but this was all they were willing to compensate.) However, they are unable to transfer the money to me; the two options are to either get it sent to a Vietnamese bank account, or to collect it in cash in Vietnam. As an international traveller, I do not have a Vietnamese bank account, and I was not informed of the option to collect the money in cash before leaving Vietnam. Therefore, it seems impossible to get my compensation. Second, the food and drink options on board are extremely limited, and despite trying to request vegetarian meals a number of times before checking in there were no options on board, apart from one pot of instant noodles over a 12 hour flight. Furthermore, you are only allowed one alcoholic beverage at meal times, and there is no option to purchase additional drinks.

### "they moved the flight to an A320"
Not Verified |  Booked travel on the 787 and in the end they moved the flight to an A320 (a very old one). Service of the cabin crew was ok. Food wise, wouldn't pay that much for business if I knew they were going to serve me that. If I was not mistaken, it was 2 choices, chicken rice or the beef udon. Total rubbish. Seat was cramped on business too.

### "Never again, what a disgrace"
They will cancel last minute and won’t bother to send customers a courtesy email or text to inform you this has occurred. You’d think crew on the ground would be present to address concerns, of course not let’s make customers line up and find out themselves and send police incase things get out of hand. After speaking and emailing the representative here they apologised and said sit tight the company will get in touch to rebook. After getting home (a few hours later) received an email to say oh wait the flight isn’t canceled come back they are ready to fly now! I think not. Never again, what a disgrace.

### "doesn't position itself as low cost"
Quite uneventful, flight was on a very clean and new airplane. Got a little bottle of water and refreshing towel, probably a little biscuit or even small sandwich would have been appropriate as the airline doesn't position itself as low cost but rather full service.

### "Staff on board were pleasant but extremely untrained and disorganised"
Not Verified |  Disorganised, poorly trained staff, tiny portions of food. Check in at Hanoi, staff member at check in desk was uninterested, sending messages on his phone the whole time he was serving me. Didn't ask security questions, didn't give me a chance to explain that the contents of my luggage were fragile, and didn't even offer a choice of seat. Food - only 2 very very small meals on a 13 hour flight. No vegetarian option. No options to choose meal before flight. Portions were small so an hour after eating I was starving (I weigh 50kg and do not eat much). Other passengers felt the same and staff made pot noodles when requested - so most the flight was engulfed in that nasty pot noodle smell. Dinner was served unannounced an hour and a half after take off, and then nothing until breakfast an hour and a half before landing. Service Staff on board were pleasant but extremely untrained and disorganised. They asked a few passengers to put phones away for take off but rule seemed to be arbitrarily applied. Same with seats in upright position. Half the cabin got offered eye shades, the other half didn't. Some passengers were clearly drunk and kept calling cabin crew who succumbed to their every demand at the expense and discomfort of other passengers. A circus/joke. Luggage Items in my suitcase were damaged on arrival. Positives: new aircraft.

### "terrible airline"
Ho Chi Minh to Quy Nhon. A terrible, terrible airline with awful customer service. Due to Covid-19, I could not fly on Jan 2021; I then requested for a refund. They took 2 weeks for every reply email, and they did not respond properly on Facebook, which ultimately take over 1 year and they still haven't refunded my money, despite my official request via email. Bottom line: choose Vietnam Airline or VietJet instead, don't fly Bamboo Airways. They are new to the market and already have a bad reputation.

### "delighted with this airline"
I was delighted with this airline. Check-in is very fast with no long line due to efficient crowd management (no designated boarding desk, instead one staff asked us which flight we board then directed us to a check-in desk which is empty and fast). Cabin staff is helpful, food selection is rather limited with only a cold sandwich provided for the HAN-SGN route (no hot meal, hot drinks or purchase option). Inflight entertainment not provided.

### "this flight was terrible"
The review for this flight was terrible. 2 times I booked through the bamboo website using my credit card but it always failed, but the payment has been successfully taken. Call to CS they promised to call me back within 2 hours but after 3 hours I was not contacted. I was afraid the price would go up I asked for certainty because I didn't want to double book. My Vietnamese friend helped contact them and according to him I should ordered again, after I made a payment with a different credit card I still didn't receive the ticket. I complained to them via IG and they promised to forward my ticket and cancel another book in the morning. I explained that the price could go up in the future but they promised that I got the ticket according to what I bought. the next day I was contacted by them and they asked me to go to their office and kept on promising that I would get my ticket without having to buy a more expensive ticket, the ticket turned out to be 50% more expensive. after I got there. CS there was not at all helpful and they even admitted that the error was from their website, and what a brilliant service from them I was told by them to buy another ticket at a higher price - they admit it was their fault, and I am the loser because I was charged twice and as a recovery service I have to pay for the 3rd ticket at a price that is 50% more expensive and even their manager doesn't provide a solution, just ask for my number just to check who called me and yet again and also they asked the risk information too regarding my credit card. The food they provide is only 1 type, namely pork sandwiches. as a person who does not eat pork because of religion this is really very disappointing, there is no other food alternative so I don't get a meal. If possible to give 0 stars, i would be love to give it

### "Do not try it"
Not Verified | Disaster, 2 tries, 1 canceled flight and 1 postponed 9 hours. Even Vietjet has more options. They destroyed our holidays twice in 2 months time. Its isn't worth the hassle, and its more costly in the end. Do not try it, you will regret it.

### "The food was good"
Hanoi to Nha Trang. Very good airline, from the airport to the cabin. The cabin crew were friendly and hard working. The food was good for a 2 hours flight. Good legroom, fast service. Check in was quick.

### "no sign of the promised refund"
At short notice Bamboo Airlines cancelled our flight and proposed an alternative schedule that got us into Hanoi late at night as opposed to early afternoon as originally planned. We rejected the alternative flight and were advised that we would be refunded our flights subject to sending confirmation that we did not want the alternative and card details to facilitate the refund, which we duly did. Over a month on and six e-mails later we have still not had the courtesy of any communications from Bamboo and no sign of the promised refund.

### "pay a lot of money for some extra kilos"
Seoul to Da Nang in January 2020. I had booked my flight ticket with an extra baggage and i also paid for it. But the airline couldn't find my reservation, so i have to pay a lot of money for some extra kilos at the checkin counter!

### "Can't recommend the customer Service"
Phu Quoc to Ho Chi Minh City. Can't recommend the customer Service for the airline. The changed 3 different flights that i booked to another days. They offered me on the hotline to get a refund or change the flight if i write them an email, but i didnt get an answer!

### "Very bad service!"
Phu Quoc to Ho Chi Minh City. Very bad service! The changed my flight to the next day, the hotline sayed i can get a refund for the the flight ticket. But i need to write an email to the support, but i didnt get an answer back.

### "Do not use this airline"
Not Verified |  I sent an email to their support and to refund email address about 10 days ago. Then I sent a follow-up email another 5 days after that. I got no response from anyone. I needed to urgently refund my tickets but It seems like they do not have any support and so I will have just lost my money. My country has put a travel ban on international travel so I couldn't take the flight. However, because Bamboo Airways did not reply to me I just lost my money. Do not use this airline.

### "between a low cost and full service"
Not Verified |  Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi. Long queue at check-in. Bamboo really need more check-in desks. Asked to pay additional charge for hold baggage - it wasn't clear on their on-line reservation system that my fare didn't include baggage. Bamboo need to make their reservation system clearer what is and what is not included on each fare basis. Boarding straightforward. Flight departed on schedule (something quite rare in Vietnam!) and, smooth on an almost new 787. Water and small pastry served as during flight. Cabin crew were friendly and efficient. Airline tries to be mid way between a low cost carrier and full service airline - and is successful in this aim but More check-in desks please.

### "the insensitive response"
Not Verified |  Hanoi to Phu Quoc. Requested a review due to visa suspension and holiday cancelled due to covid-19. Here's the insensitive response: "Dear Sir/Madam, Thank you for sending email to Bamboo Airways Customer Care System, After checking your booking code on system, your fare class is Bamboo Plus for domestic route. We regret that we would not apply refund policy for this fare class according to Bamboo Airways Commercial Policy. Yours faithfully.

### "Would fly this airline again"
Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi. The check-in gates are SGN were very crowded, but moved efficiently and I was helped in about ten minutes. No problem with delays/cancellation, and the boarding process went smoothly as well. We were shuttled from the gate to the tarmac as the airport didn’t have enough space for all the planes. The flight experience was a bit bumpier than I would’ve liked, but we were all given a bottle of water and a small egg salad sandwich (which was not bad at all). A huge plus for me was that the economy ticket includes a checked baggage — if you’re traveling across Asia, it’s not easy to pack super light. I booked my flight three months before the travel date, and the price was comparable to Vietjet. Would fly this airline again.

### "bad attitude from the staff"
Phu Quoc to Ho Chi Minh City. Extremely disapointed with the airline. After some early months with advertising and claim to be a good and honest airline, but finally they are very bad with services and attitude. Flight attendant can only communicate badly in English (not native speaker) - aircraft are old. The ticket is not cheap, as they claim themselves as not being a low cost airline - but fastly turn out operating the same way with all low cost airlines - the ticket does not include check in baggage - I felt like I am being cheated - force to buy a stupid pack for check in baggage, even mine is just a little heavier than 7kg. The services is totally not deserved any like their "slogan" states, bad attitude from the staff - I'm sure that this is my last time flying with Bamboo.

### "would prefer a low cost carrier"
Ho Chi Minh to Danang. We did not had to cue at check in because we were travelling with 2 toddlers. Unfortunately, the check in staff could not retrieve one boarding pass in the system and we had to wait at the counter for 24 minutes. 24 minutes for printing 5 boarding passes! The flight was boarded by bus. The bus was overcrowded and we had to wait long time in the heat for the last passenger to arrive. A second bus would have been a good option. The aircraft was clean. The food was a piece of sandwich bread and inedible. The drink choice was none, everyone got a bottle of water. I would prefer a low cost carrier where I can have the drink and food I like but pay for it instead of getting something for free you do not want. The flight arrived one hour late.

### "FAs were all Turkish women"
Hanoi to Hue 5th January on an A320-200. Purchase online was easy and very clear without any hidden costs. A minor reschedule was clearly informed (and adjustable) weeks before departure. Check in smooth though long queues despite 10 counters open. Had to wait 40 Minutes to be checked in. Got offered seat and chose an exit seat as flight was only half full. No issue with luggage like for other low cost carriers, especially the Vietjetair extremely strict luggage policies with several checks in airports. Onboard, 4 FAs and 2 service attendants for 80 passengers. The FAs were all Turkish women while the SAs were Vietnamese and acted mainly as translators. Given water, tissue, magazines. I brought my own coffee sachets to get expresso onboard. 8 business class seats were empty. Flight on time. Bus gating in both ends. Extremely good value for money, paid 33 USD. Attendant were very talkative and extrovert. No IFE on board but flight took only 70 Minutes. Bamboo Airways have their logos and branding everywhere onboard with nice decorations and new uniforms etc. Even the drinking water were produced, labelled and marketed by the airline. Bamboo is considered as an LCC carrier but compares to a 3-star legacy carrier. A meal or at least a snack would have been nice but hard to claim for the price paid.

### "crew were fantastic"
Quy Nhon to Hanoi, Very good from start to finish. The check in was quick. Boarding was also quick. The aircraft was a new A320-neo. The crew were fantastic and service was pleasant, helpful and very friendly. They also offer a complimentary snack and water.

### "service was impeccable"
Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City. I have tried both business and economy class, service was impeccable, impossible to find any faults. Despite being a low-cost carrier, Bamboo Airways still includes in-flight meal and luggage which is much better and exceeds Vietjet Air. I highly recommend this airline to those who want to travel domestically inside Vietnam.

### "attendant really friendly"
Vinh city to Buon Ma Thuat. Bamboo airways is  amazing, flight attendant really friendly, the snacks is not delicious but it quite good. Everybody must try this airline.

### "satisfied with this flight"
Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi. Really satisfied with this flight. Flight was on time. Meal was very tasty. Cabin crew were professional and friendly.

### "Definite value for money"
Hanoi to Danang. Finally an airline that has bought back the service in Vietnam. Impressed and hope they keep it up. Check in seamless, lounge infinitely better than others in Noi Bai. Flight left as scheduled could not ask for more. Definite value for money.
