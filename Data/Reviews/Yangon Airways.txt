### "All in all a good flight"
Bagan to Heho. Very short flight again another ATR aircraft, as a nervous passenger I was not looking forward to the flight but it was great. Seating was 2-2, no seat numbers given as only a few passengers on this flight. No Inflight snack but coffee or cold drinks were supplied. All in all a good flight and would travel again.

### Yangon Airways customer review
Took the 4 tourist flights around Myanmar all flights departed and arrived ahead of schedule. Planes clean with good leg room friendly and efficient cabin crew. On the 2 longer flights a very pleasant snack was served and the best cup of airline coffee I have had in almost 40 years of air travel plus a choice of juice on the 2 small flights.

### Yangon Airways customer review
We were booked to take 4 flights on Yangon in June. A little concerned when we fronted the quaint little desk in Yangon to find it unattended but were assured that there are helpers at all Myanmar airports who take your bag to the desk and deal with it. The next 3 flights on Yangon were good. Planes were all prop aircraft seating about 70. I think we were on the same plane every time. Seats are not allocated which worried us at first but it was not an issue. The sticker to identify patrons in the departure lounge are a cute touch. Nice little snack and drink no matter how short the flight. Staff were friendly and helpful.

### Yangon Airways customer review
RGN-MDL on ATR . We were a bit sceptical when our travel agency booked on Air Yangon because we couldnÂ´t find much about this airline in Skytrax. The plane left twenty minutes earlier than in our tickets stated- so do reconfirm the day before ! No hassle with luggage and weight security checks -as in the whole country- very relaxed but efficient. Comfortable seating on this short trip little snack for those who are extremely hungry. Friendly staff clean plane and very pleasant flight. We felt safe and would fly with them again.
