### "rudeness of the ground staff"
Unfortunately my experience with Brussels airlines has been horrible. The rudeness of the ground staff, combined with the delayed flights made my experience with this airline truly tiring. I tried to complain multiple times but their customer service was simply incompetent.

### "experience has truly shocked me"
Brussels Airlines damaged my luggage, and have not made amends 10 months later. After several calls to their call centers, I'm being told I'm going to get a call back within 24/48 hours, but I have yet to get any call back. They keep saying the same thing "this time you will definitely get a call back". It's like talking to a scam/phishing company, not a well known airline. This experience has truly shocked me. Lucky I don't need to choose Brussels airlines ever again.

### “lack of coordination and communication”
Avoid Brussels Airlines—do not bother to fly with them. I was flying business class from Newark to Barcelona on February 13th, and my bags were lost. They arrived in Florence 10 days later, but Brussels Airlines never informed me, leaving me to coordinate with United, the originating airline. The only contact I received from Brussels Airlines was an email on February 27th confirming my bags were delivered to the town I was staying in, though I didn’t actually receive them until the 26th. Even with my bags in the area, their lack of coordination and communication caused unnecessary delays. Finally, after months of silence, they dismissed my claim on October 30th, citing my two-month stay in Italy as a “permanent address,” despite my round-trip ticket to the US. Their delays, automated responses, and dismissive attitude show a complete disregard for customers—even in business class. I expected far better service, but Brussels Airlines proved to be unreliable and unprofessional.

### “highlight was the crew”
Flight SN2293 on the 21st of October 2024. Efficient boarding, welcoming crew and comfortable seats. The flight left with a slight delay of 10' but arrived 20' earlier in Stockholm. The highlight was the crew. Charming, well groomed, cheerful and carried out an excellent cabin bag management during boarding. The seemed to be enjoying their jobs and their enthusiasm was contagious. It was a pleasure to fly them.

### "Worst customer service ever"
Not Verified | I was travelling from Brussels to Naples. My luggage didn’t arrive. The day after I received a message indicating that my luggage had been located in Frankfurt. I had no news for a couple of days and then received an email telling me that an agent will contact me. An agent never contacted me ; on the contrary, I called the customer service with an Indian agent who told me that the luggage was not in Naples airport. I read reviews online that were saying to go directly to the airport so after several days we decided to return to Naples airport. Nobody at the airport knew if and where my luggage would be but they allowed me at the airport to check in a couple of different rooms. I finally found the luggage in a dodgy underground room. During all those days, I didn’t have any of my clothes nor basic necessities so I had to buy everything I needed. When upon return to Brussels I asked for indemnification for those items I had bought, I received an email from the customer service telling me that I had been notified that my luggage was available at the Naples airport - which never happened. Worst customer service ever.

### "lack of action and customer service"
I am thoroughly frustrated and disappointed by the lack of action and customer service from Brussels Airlines. My flight from Vilnius to Geneva was cancelled on May 12, and I promptly submitted a compensation claim. On May 23, the airline confirmed my compensation entitlement of €400 per passenger. Since then, I have been waiting for payment, which was promised to be processed within 6 to 8 weeks. It's now September 30, and I still have not received any compensation. I have sent over 20 emails and submitted 2 new claims on their website, but have received no response. I've also made 3 phone calls to the customer service center, sent a direct email to the head of customer service, and still nothing. This lack of communication and disregard for customer rights is appalling. Under European law, specifically EC Regulation 261/2004, passengers are entitled to compensation when a flight is cancelled. Brussels Airlines is clearly violating this regulation by failing to honor their commitments. It is unacceptable that an airline would promise a 72-hour response time but not fulfill this or even acknowledge the claim after more than 4 months. This is a serious breach of consumer rights, and I urge Brussels Airlines to finally pay attention to my claim and settle the compensation as required by law.

### “cabin crow was rude”
Not Verified | I was treated badly on flight SN 2103, seat 17D to London at 21:20 on 29/10/2024. I took a wrong way by mistake and the lady from cabin crow was rude. She should have been more polite. She also asked me to weigh my suitcase, which I use every time I fly. The suitcase weighed 10.8 kg, but she said it was only allowed to weigh 8 kg and couldn't be carried inside. I'll be looking at other options for future flights to London, even though I'm a member of Miles and More. I'm also taken three flights per month to London. British Airways offers a better service when I compare.

### "The incompetence is staggering"
Not Verified | Absolutely useless. Not only did they manage to lose all six of our bags, packed to the brim with equipment that we actually need to do our job, but now they’re playing some absurd game of pass the parcel with them. First, they tell me they’ve handed the bags off to a delivery company — brilliant, I think, progress at last — but of course, the number they gave me to ring them doesn’t even work. No surprises there. So, I go online, trying to find any hint of where our bags are, and the delivery company says they’ve never even seen them. Not a trace. It's as if these people take perverse pleasure in making life as difficult as humanly possible. This is hands down the worst airline I’ve ever had the misfortune of dealing with. The incompetence is staggering.

### "business configuration was 2-2-2"
Not Verified |  Surprisingly good experience. Cabin staff were unbelievably attentive and helpful. Food and beverages were excellent for airline food. Boarding and deboarding were well organized. Only downside was business configuration was 2-2-2 and flat bed was not as comfortable as on other airlines.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Check in started very slowly at the airport with the employee getting out of the counter to check the line length instead of working to decrease it. Weird, but it is okay, we are on vacation. Flight was delayed two hours and we spent one hour inside the aircraft just sitting there - took a power nap, all good. But arrived in Brussels and my luggage was completely damaged. Filed a report, got a reference number, went to the Dolfi site as instructed, filled all documentation and waited. Today an email arrives saying: "Dear passenger, Unfortunately we cannot proceed with the case, as the documents required by the airline have not been included or are not complete. Please send us the missing documents via email: - damage report from the airport We can only proceed with the case when the documents are complete. Thank you for your cooperation. We are looking forward to your reply. Terrible customer service!

### "first and last time ever"
Not Verified |  And even 1 star is still too much! Seats booked in row 1 (we thought we saw it from the online photo/drawing) 23 pp there and 23 back, so a total of 92 euros. My husband is 2m+ and also quite coarse and has a problem with his knees due to an operation in the past. I have edema in my legs and fly with support/compression material and then it is not always pleasant to sit in one position for long flights. And they also have to be taken off after a certain moment because otherwise the position will pinch and then stretching is nice. Please note that walking ensures that the legs fill up again and so do sitting back in that position. Outward journey (the day before we received an announcement that we had been rebooked. Immediately reported that we didn't think this was nice because you first make us pay for more expensive seats and then we disappear into a row behind them for 14 euros. The difference is almost 10 pp. About 2 hours Later we suddenly receive an email: do you want to book business class seats with a rate of 190 pp? I thought, how is this possible, because I apparently missed it on the drawing of the seat reservation? Immediately contacted us and Brussels Airlines assured that we did NOT have us for us but a cabin and that business was separate... Well, those people who have now paid 190 euros must have enjoyed this bit of extra service!! 3 glasses of champagne every half hour the question is everything to your liking? And with a length of 1.65 all the extra space? To then sit in 1 in the same room and go to the same toilet and the Seats we had originally booked were NOT involved! And even across the row, other people from behind unceremoniously moved for the business seats!!! The purser did not blink or blush and had even indicated to the stewardess that he found this quite antisocial! Answer, sorry, then you should have paid for more expensive seats and you have more space at the emergency exit (that is not entirely true!) On the return journey the drama was even greater and it is the first and last time ever that I flew with this airline! En zelfs 1 ster is nog te veel! Seats geboekt op rij 1 (dachten we met de online foto/tekening te zien) 23 p.p heen en 23. Terug dus totaal 92 euro. Mijn man is 2m+ en ook best grof en een probleem met de knieën door een operatie in het verleden. Ikzelf heb oedeem aan mijn benen en vlieg met steun/compressie materiaal en dan is lang vliegen niet altijd fijn in 1 houdin te zitten. En ze moeten ook uit na een bepaald moment omdat die houding anders knelt en dan is strekken fijn. Let wel lopen zorgt ervoor dat de benen weer vollopen en terug zitten in die houding dus ook. Heenreis( dag ervoor een mededeling dat we waren omgeboekt. Meteen gemeld dat we dit niet netjes vonden want je laat ons eerst duurdere Seats betalen en vervolgens verdwijnen we een rij erachter voor 14 euro. Verschil is dus bijna 10. Pp. Een kleine 2 uur later krijgen we ineens mail wilt u business class Seats boeken met een tarief van 190!! Pp? Ik dacht nog huh hoe kan dit want op de tekening van stoel reservering heb ik die blijkt gemist? Meteen contact gezocht en Brussel airlines verzekerde dat we GEEN wij voor ons hadden maar cabine en dat business apart was… Nou wat zullen die mensen die nu dus 190 euro betaald hebben genoten hebben van dit stukje extra service zeg!! 3 glazen champagne elk half uur de vraag alles naar wens? En met 1.65 lengte alle extra ruimte? Om vervolgens in 1 in dezelfde ruimte te zitten en naar dezelfde toilet te gaan en de Seats die we oorspronkelijk geboekt hadden dus NIET betrokken waren! En trokken er zelfs aan de overkant van de rij andere mensen van achter zonder pardon om de business Seats!!! De purser verblikte of bloosde niet en had zelfs bij de stewardess aangegeven dit behoorlijk asociaal te vinden! Antwoord, sorry dan had u maar duurdere stoelen moeten betalen en u heeft meer ruimte bij de nooduitgang( dat is dus niet geheel waar!) Op de terugreis was het drama zelfs nog veel groter en is het meteen de eerste en laatste keer ooit dat ik met deze maatschappij heb gevlogen!

### "Best customer service ever"
Brussels airlines is the best! I left my laptop on plane and sent an email to lost and found and 4 hours later when I was at United gate for connecting flight someone brought it to me. I had written an email to the airline’s lost and found. Best customer service ever!! Thank you Brussels Airlines!!! You are the best.

### "poor in-flight service standards"
Flew from Heathrow to Nairobi via Brussels. LHR to BRU no service in economy class, no different to a low cost airline, but arrived on time. Boarding on connecting flight was slow, so departed late for NBO. I was seated in rear economy cabin. Drinks started in front economy cabin first. Normally in my experience the entire economy cabin get their drinks, before the next service starts. But on this flight the front economy class passengers were getting their meals, while passengers in the rear of the cabin had yet to receive even their drinks. Seat tray really small and meal tray so small, made eating difficult. Meal small and uninspiring, wooden cutlery. Service always seemed rushed. On return flight just before landing in Brussels the second service consisted of one croissant and absolutely nothing else, no butter, no fruit, nothing! Just tea or coffee. No hot towels, no metal cutlery. Would not choose to fly them again unless they were the cheapest. I certainly would not choose them again for their poor in-flight service standards.

### "a joke of an airline"
What a joke of an airline. From boarding and putting us in non priority line, to worst chairs, to losing both of our luggage even in business class. The service was OK but express. No entertainment. For 1200 euros you'd expect more junk airline.

### “Cabin staff great”
Brussels-Corfu return. Both flights arrived ahead or on schedule. Old but well kept planes. Good selection of food and drinks at ok prices. Cabin staff as very often with them great! I do recommend them without hesitation and as a Belgian I am proud when I can fly with them. (at the right price off course).

### “lacks the most basic hygiene on board”
Brussels Airlines lacks transparency: the flight was more than 3 hours late, however no communication via email or SMS message was sent. Brussels Airlines treats people like cattle: all people boarding a Brussels airlines flight in Lomé are pre-checked in and directed towards a crowded room, hours in advance, without access to restrooms and refreshments. To get out of this room, one has to pass again the whole security process, taking off the cloths and passing through line ups and a humiliating procedure. In addition, there is no more boarding by groups, instead everybody boards the plane together as a crowd. Brussels Airlines lacks the most basic hygiene on board: the plane was dirty beyond anything I have seen before, garbage and bread crumbles on the floor everywhere, pee on the seats (picture attached) and the table dirty and sticky. When my wife asked for a disinfectant wipe, the crew lady didn’t even answer her. It took 15 minutes and asking twice to get almost throwed one at her, with an aggressive attitude. Brussels Airlines flight attendants are lacking the most basic professionalism and customer service skills, are abusive, random, bully and discriminatory towards the passengers: a culture of impunity seems to dominate Brussels Airlines crews, proved by the lack of any surveys after flights and by the difficulty of finding how to send a formal complaint. In addition, they refuse to show their badge with their name or give you any indicator that may identify them to the airline management. During this flight, I was seated in Economy Premium section, which was three mostly empty. As a result, multiple passengers from the economy section came to seat there and the crew just closed their eyes to this self-reclassification. Since my wife was sick, after diner she came to sit with me for a couple of hours, until I was awakened by two female flight attendants, one dressed in black and the other one in red, yelling at my wife to return to her seat. The comments and the tone of the voice were completely hysterical. I tried to explain that she is sick, and she is just siting there such as multiple other people around without a premium economy ticket did. I asked them to identify themselves and if a doctor was on board. They continued yelling and ignored my requests. She showed them her skin rash on her hands, probably prompted by the lack of hygiene on board. The two lady flight attendants became more aggressive, threatening her that they would bring her back to her seat by force. I asked how about the other people around that had also economy tickets and are seating in the premium section and I got a “none of your business” answer. Again, unlike the other 4 persons in the same situation as her, she just sat 3 hours in economy premium out of the 9 of the whole flight and did not enjoy food or any other privilege of premium economy. She just wanted to be comforted by me while being sick. What impacted me the most was the outrageous behavior of the two female flight attendants, the hate and discrimination they displayed towards my wife (the other 4 persons that sneaked in from the economy class were white male passengers), as well as the self-assurance that nothing can happen to them, no disciplinary action can be taken against them, whatever they do or say on board of the aircraft. Finally, ironically, just 10 minutes later, on the seat vacated by my wife came to seat another passenger from the economy class and he was allowed.

### “very low classed product”
The European business class by Brussels was already an extremely weak and low classed product, however as from 1st April 2024 the obviously otherwordly management did add a new caper. Passengers in business class wanting a second drink have to pay for it - the meals are usually inedible and prior to 1st April you were able to chose something from the list where passengers in the economy have to pay for (sandwiches cookies) So when flying to Barcelona (fare something around 361 €), once again the meal was some Buckwheat with 4 pieces of chicken - no fruit, cheese or sweet added - yes 2 chocolates - I was not so hungry and certainly not in the mood to eat that inferior meal, I requested for some cookies and promptly a bill of 4 € - lucky I did not open the packet yet - I gave it back when paying a business class fare I simply refuse to pay for anything on board! Had a decent small sandwich in Barcelona! I must describe Brussels Airlines as the most scandalous airline in business in Western Europe and it is really the only place where I am feeling ashamed to be a Belgian. Instead of painting their very old planes with hard seats in very fancy colours (Red Devils, Brueghel) the company better should offer a decent business class with an upmarket Belgian meal - 2 chocolates is not enough. Senior management should be very ashamed with its very low classed product in a country with a reputation for great food.

### "fare is unbeatable"
The fare is unbeatable, and staff were very nice. I had a delicious kosher meal and Pita Falafel. Drinks were offered generously. I arrived refreshed and am happy about my choice. If I need to bring up negatives that will only be bus shuttle to a field position at origin airport, and for some strange reason their coffee is very acidic.

### “customer service was extremely rude”
For me, this is by far the worst airline in Europe. How they treat property of their passengers and the passengers itself is without words. I was flying with Brussels from Brussels to Munich. The flight was delayed by multiple hours and the ground personnel was extremely unfriendly. In addition, they lost my luggage and did not want to pay a compensation. This is already bad, but how Brussels was handling my case afterwards was just disturbing and unbelievable. The customer service of Brussels Airlines was not only unhelpful but also extremely rude. The experience with them has been deeply disturbing, not just because of the financial loss (which is significant) but especially because I know after this experience that Brussels Airlines is not an airline you should trust to treat you with fairness. Their unwillingness to provide reasonable solutions or exhibit a basic level of customer service decency is alarming. I urge anyone considering flying with Brussels to think twice. The only good thing with this airline is that after experiencing them, you appreciate other airlines.

### "very bad SN lounge in Brussels"
Good service overall. Professional cabin crew. However, very bad SN lounge in Brussels: the food is really bad and the staff are unpleasant. New seats on A320neo are also not comfortable at all.

### "made me buy a whole new ticket"
Not Verified |  They charged me huge flight change costs, failed to call me back 8 times (after promising to do so) and then made me buy a whole new ticket for my return flight. Turned out to be the most expensive flight/mile I've ever taken.

### “Staff very rude and not understanding”
Not Verified | Awful ground staff! I am extremely disappointed with this company and will never travel with them again! I have been traveling with Brussels Airlines for quite some time. My flight was scheduled for 7:10am, boarding starting at 6:20 am. Having checked in online the day before my trip, I arrived at the baggage drop at 6:10 am. There was a lady before me, so the agent checked her in and labeled her luggage. My turn came, he took my passport to check, then told me to drop my luggage to be labeled. Everything was fine until he told me to wait as he was going to talk to his manager as my luggage wouldn’t make it to the plane because I was late, I could not board the plane and I would have to rebook, I was astonished. I did not understand what was happening! The plane was still boarding. I still had 50 minutes left. Passengers were still coming. They had the same problems as me! The agent refused to take our bags claiming that we were late while we weren’t. There was still enough time! Boarding wasn’t close as it had just started! He then took us to his manager, who did not want to hear anything! She completely refused to help. She told us to go straight talk to the people in charge of bookings! Once there, they told us we had to pay extra for rebooking while we did not miss the flight at all. I had to pay extra £173 for the next flight which was scheduled at 5:50pm then stay overnight in Brussels as my connection was at 12:10pm the next day! They just refused to take our bags while we had already checked in! Then that makes us pay extra money. On top of that, which makes us spending 24 hours for a 9 hours flight! Some people had to wait two more days as there wasn’t any connection availability for them. Staff are very rude and are not understanding at all! It’s ridiculous and very frustrating!

### "not fly with this airline ever again"
Terrible flight and customer service from this airline. Lost baggage, poor customer service and communication when there were flight delays (for departure and then connecting flight) . The flight was expensive given the experience I had. I would not fly with this airline ever again.

### "Overall very satisfied"
Excellent flight. Easy check in. Left on time and arrived early. Very good cabin crew and service. Purchased food and beverage and was satisfied with quality and cost. Clear information from the flight deck. Comfortable enough seats for short flight. Baggage arrived quickly. Overall very satisfied and would fly with them again.

### "had to wait to our luggage"
I did not get my luggage after arriving. That was late, near 23 o'clock. We had to wait to our luggage ca 1,5 hour. I missed my connecting train as well. It was necessary to book a hotel room. Next day I missed my working pass.

### “Crew professional and courteous”
Not Verified | Return flights were smooth and very low cost like. Crew professional and courteous. Comparing to similar flights with KLM I’d say they are expensive and not a value for money Airline perhaps because this is a business route without competition!

### "genuinely shocked by the experience"
I was genuinely shocked by the experience considering this is a scheduled and not budget airline. The plane was old and dirty. The economy seats small and extremely uncomfortable. Usb charging ports did not work. Wooden cutlery was offered with meals and for a 7h hour flight we were only offered drinks and refreshments (alongside the main meal) once - the cabin crew did not check on passengers in between service and disappeared outside of these times. I upgraded to premium economy for the return flight to London. A slightly better experience. However, the premium economy section has no access to its own toilet so you have to walk back 20 rows to use the economy toilet. I was the first passenger to use the toilet after the flight took off. It was dirty and clearly not cleaned between flights. The seats are more comfortable in Premium Economy but not more than standard economy on another international carrier. The brussels air app is useless and doesn't give timely flight updates. Our connection flight was cancelled and I was not notified just rebooked onto a later flight with no offer of compensation or clear notification. Brussels Airline would never fly this standard of plane or long haul service to western destinations e.g. the US. I believe they do it because most of the passengers are non European and they clearly do not care about our comfort or offering a decent level of service - they just want our money. The ticket was overpriced and nearly as much as a cheap business class ticket for other airlines.

### “save your money”
Worst airlines company ever, they give you the option to upgrade your flight from economy to business and yet there isn't any difference inside the plane since all seats are the same. Apparently being seated up front means business class. Also there is no lounge option at the Frankfurt airport. So if you decide to choose this airlines better save up your money by not wasting it with upgrades.

### "very disastrous experience"
Boarding was rather OK. Service in business was extremely poor , even scandalous. Breakfast was a nearly frozen mini croissant and and ice cold mini bread roll with i think 7 gram of the cheapest cheese. I asked for a cola zer, I had to open it by myself, no ice or lemon was offered FA were very annoyed there were a few business pax so that they had to do the service; Once again a very disastrous experience on that airline.

### "cancelled my return flight"
Brussels Airlines mistakenly logged me as a "no show" on my outbound flight and consequently cancelled my return flight. I found this out via email when I switched on my phone shortly after landing. My short break in Brugge was marred by the stress and worry this caused me. I made a total of 16 phone calls to their call centre in India, each time having to go through the whole process again, arguing that I HAD taken my flight, I was calling from Belgium, had the stamp in my passport to prove it, etc. I cried, I begged for help, was promised countless times that someone would call me back, no-one did. On the morning I was due to fly home, I took to Facebook Messenger to ask for help. I was told I had to make my own plans to get home. After three hours of arguing with the representative there, my flight home was finally reinstated, leaving me with a mere four hours to relax enjoy the rest of my stay. I did get a call back from Customer Services - three days after I arrived home! I have launched a formal complaint via their website, their initial reply was that all was OK because they reinstated my flight, and that, in future, if I needed urgent help I should ring their Customer Services! They completely ignored the fact that I had told them that I'd indeed rung them 16 times during my 2½ day stay and no help was forthcoming. Their representatives appeared to have difficulty with comprehension, and quite a few had poor English and accents that were difficult to understand. I have since lodged another official complaint and have stated that I will be claiming compensation. Apart from the Auto-generated reply, this complaint is being ignored, despite my sending several further emails asking for a response.

### “This is worse than Ryanair”
Not Verified | I have never, in a life time of frequent flying, come across a customer service that is so ferociously, exceptionally poor. I have called eight times in five days to resolve an issue with my booking and each time been told that someone would call back that same day to help me with my issue. So far no one has called back. The flight was this morning. This is worse than Ryanair, worse than anything I have come across ever.

### "Appalling customer service"
Appalling customer service! The airline lost our luggage and it was delivered after a week. Upon delivery the luggage was visibly damaged, and all the things inside were damaged by rain and external force. We asked for compensation upon delivering proof of damage, both external and internal. The claim was dismissed since they saw in the photos that the luggage contained one pack of ibuprofen tablets. According to their General Conditions of Carriage, medicine is forbidden to be included in the checked luggage. The logic between a smashed luggage beyond further ruse and an ibuprofen pill is only known to them. Will never use this airline again.

### "see their 3 star status confirmed"
Brussels-Dakar-Brussels. Not so happy with check-in at BRU. I checked online and when at the check in area, a SN lady directed to me bag drop off. While she stood next to me, I had to print the luggage label myself, wrap it around the bag handle and she forgot to tell me to take off one of those little baggage check number stickers and stick it on my suitcase. I didn't appreciate it, I wanted her to do that work! Increasingly we passengers are being asked to pay more for services and now we are being put to work at the airport, just like scanning your own food at the super market! Efficiency is good, but service is better. I have my limits. On the leg BRU-DSS other passengers and myself were surprised at the gate that the plane was an A333 of Eurowings. The flight attendant assured me the seats were the same for economy (but a bit worse for business!). It wasn't a big problem for me, but I think SN should have indicated this on the ticket. Apparently the Eurowings Airbus is regularly deployed to SN's African routes. On the leg DSS-BRU a normal SN A333 was deployed. SN's airbus looked quite fresh and new from the inside so, happy with that. Departures were on time and in both cases we arrived early at our destinations; that was a nice bonus. Flight attendants were friendly but more on 'neutral-friendly' side. Inflight entertainment was a bit limited but with a decent selection. Now comes my main complaint: the food. In both cases, a tiny plate was served for dinner. Consisting of a choice between meat or pasta. I chose meatballs which was two 4cm diameter meatballs and bit of rice. With that, a sub-par quality bread bun, a bit of butter and not tasty cake, which was the same cake in the way back! No cheese, no little salad, no little fruit salad either. No sanitary napkin, no spoons, no pepper and salt. The red wine was not tasty. On BRU-DSS they served an ice cream before landing. On DSS-BRU, morning flight, a simple croissant. Brussels Airlines really needs to do better here, this is where you see their 3 star status confirmed, instead of the 4 stars they could have.

### “too low quality for this price”
Part of trip from Brussels to Gdańsk through Frankfurt, leg from Brussels to Frankfurt was operated by Brussels Airlines. Checkin was fast and easy - Brussels is a hub of Brussels Airlines, so checkin is always open and you can drop luggage at any time. Airline lounge is very nice. Boarding starts 5 minutes before time given on boarding pass. After seating inside plane crew asked me to remove my luggage from overhead compartment and put under seat in front of me because my luggage was smaller than other passenger. During flight there was absolutely no complimentary service. Seats are Ok, but nothing special. Finally flight was on time. Definitely too low quality for this price.

### “disheartening incident of discrimination”
Not Verified |  Today’s flight from Brussels to Yaoundé was marred by a disheartening incident of apparent discrimination during the boarding process. Despite the assigned boarding group numbers, the airline appeared to prioritize boarding passengers from Cameroon over following the established procedure. The disregard for the boarding group numbers was distressing, as it resulted in a sense of unfair treatment and disregard for the passenger experience. Furthermore, the attitude of the airline staff, who seemed unresponsive and unwilling to address the concerns raised by passengers, only exacerbated the situation. As a traveler, experiencing such treatment is profoundly disappointing and casts a shadow over the entire journey. It's particularly troubling that the reasons for this apparent discrimination were not communicated, leaving passengers feeling marginalized and disrespected. This experience has undoubtedly left a lasting impression, and regrettably, it will be my first and last time traveling with SN Brussels Airlines. Discrimination has no place in the travel industry, and I hope that the airline takes this matter seriously, addressing it with urgency and implementing measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. I believe that open and honest communication, along with a commitment to fair and respectful treatment of all passengers, is fundamental to fostering a welcoming and inclusive travel environment. It is my sincere hope that SN Brussels Airlines will prioritize addressing this issue and work towards creating a travel experience that upholds the values of equality and dignity for all passengers. Thank you for allowing me to share my experience, and I hope that through constructive feedback, positive change can be realized in the travel industry.

### "Never fly on Brussels Airlines"
Not Verified |  I booked two tickets on flights from Newark, NJ to Paris, France and return on Brussels Airlines (operated by United Airlines) using Chase Ultimate Rewards for October 2023. The morning after arriving in Paris I received an email from Brussels Airlines informing me that my return tickets had been canceled because I had not flown to Paris. This was quite a surprise since I had been on the flight and was in Paris. I borrowed a phone and called Brussels Airlines. Their call center representative took a long time to understand the problem then to verify with United that we had been on the flight. He then attempted to book me on a Lufthansa (Brussels parent company) flight at exactly the same date and time as my return Brussels flight would have been - clearly the same United flight. He could not successfully do so because  the computer was sure I hadn't flown to Paris. After 45 minutes he advised me to call Chase Ultimate Rewards. I called Chase. Chase disclaimed any responsibility. I was left high and dry with no tickets to go home. I decided not to ruin our vacation and purchased two tickets home on that same United flight for an additional $2,700. Since I got home a week ago I have been unsuccessfully trying to get a refund from Brussels Airlines and compensation for the replacement return tickets. Lessons learned: Never fly on Brussels Airlines (or Lufthansa) and never rely on Chase Ultimate Rewards to be any help whatsoever if you have a problem with a company they booked for you using points.

### "my experience was abysmal"
Not Verified |  I recently flew with Brussels Airlines, and I must say my experience was abysmal. Despite paying a hefty €600 for my ticket and ensuring I paid for my suitcase allowance, I was confronted with unexpected rudeness by the staff. The audacity reached its peak when they attempted to confiscate my suitcase – mind you, the overhead compartments had plenty of space. Their justification? They wanted me to pay for an "upgrade. It's baffling to be treated in such a manner after spending a significant amount on a ticket. Brussels Airlines, you need a serious lesson in customer service.

### "did not see my checked luggage"
Brussels Airlines is the only carrier that offers non-stop service between Bordeaux, France and Brussels, Belgium, not on its own metal but via CityJet. Departure time was delayed a few times, and we were finally off the ground for Brussels. The flight itself was uneventful, until I got to Brussels airport and did not see my checked luggage. The thing was, there were quite a few other passengers on the same flight ran into the same issue. That really screwed up my plan in Brussels as I stayed there for only 3 days. They finally found and shipped the luggage to my home in New York City a week later. There was one positive thing, though. The airline had constantly kept me informed about the status of the luggage search, though it was simply "we have not found it yet, and we are continuing to search". I still recommend the airline for that reason, plus the fact that it offers the only non-stop flight between the cities, where there is no other viable option, including any one-seat train service.

### "A positive experience"
A positive experience with Brussels Airlines. Plane was clean, and boarding was smooth and controlled. Departure was almost on time, as was arrival. Well done Brussels Airlines.

### "seems to privilege friends or family"
Not Verified |  Low cost attitude without any respect for prime customers. Brussels airlines is the only airline where they have somebody who seems to privilege friends or family and often kicks you out of your seat of choice. I am a 1K lifetime gold/million miler on United and my seat was changed twice, without notice on this specific flight. When checking in, the airline staff was even lying and said that the seat I booked was 'defect', while it was clearly occupied when in the plane. I further had 3 more similar incidents this year and will avoid the airline for sure. Unlike the fact that i fly over 100,000 miles per year, cannot even remember such issues with any other airline. Besides this the aircraft are very old A330 with average service. The airline is focused to Africa where low standards may be acceptable but there are much better alternatives for transatlantic. To avoid for sure.

### "Departure delayed by 3h 30"
Departure was delayed by 3h 30' due to a sick captain to replace and technical problems with the aircraft. Despite the terrible delay (I was also flying with a pet in the cabin, imagine keeping an animal in a cage for 3h30' extra time), the company only provided a voucher for 5 Euro (minimum cost of a drink in the airport 5.20 Euro) Reicompensation was refused because the arrival delay was 2h55' In a few words, Brussels Airlines thinks that 5 Euro are enough to compensate for such a disservice.

### "a clear absence of support or assistance"
I am thoroughly disappointed with my recent experience involving my flight booking with Brussels Airlines and the associated travel agency, flysmarter. What initially seemed to be a simple 12-hour journey turned into an inordinate ordeal that continues to persist. My original flight booking was set to have a total travel time of slightly over 12 hours. However, I was recently notified that due to a prolonged layover in Brussels, my travel time would inflate to a staggering 27 hours. Given the unwelcome increase of 18 hours, I felt compelled to cancel my journey. Shockingly, upon deciding to cancel, flysmarter demanded a cancellation fee of 500 NOK, despite the drastic alteration in my travel itinerary by Brussels Airlines. This appears highly unreasonable to me. The substantial changes to my journey were beyond my control and it seems deeply unfair to be financially penalized for such unforeseen adjustments. I've exhausted all efforts to seek resolution through customer service at both Brussels Airlines and flysmarter, but to no avail. It has been a fruitless game of passing the buck between the two entities, with neither willing to assume responsibility. The fruitless back-and-forth communication resulted in three hours of wasted time, leading to mounting frustration. I am deeply dissatisfied with the lack of customer-centricity displayed by both Brussels Airlines and flysmarter. I strongly caution potential travelers to weigh their options carefully before choosing to fly with Brussels Airlines or book through flysmarter. Should your travel plans not unfold as anticipated, it seems there's a clear absence of support or assistance. What's worse, you may find yourself unfairly financially penalized for circumstances entirely outside of your control. I wouldn't wish this disheartening experience on anyone else. Please take a look at the attached screenshot that clearly illustrates the blame game being played by Brussels Airlines and flysmarter. It is a reflection of their incredibly poor service.

### "acting like a low cost airline"
Extremely bad customer service. There are always delays and I have had the problem of adding extra luggage a few times, they say that you can add it for 30 euros (official fee) and when you try, they say it's not possible and that you have to pay 70 euros instead at the airport to do so! They never reply to any emails or messages or complaint forms etc. The tickets cost a fortune and they don't even offer a glass of water for a five-hour flight. The seats are becoming harder, less comfortable and narrower, and Brussels Airlines is acting like a low cost airline which it most definitely is not given the exaggerated fees. What a rip off! Highly disappointed.

### "I am profoundly disappointed"
I am profoundly disappointed by the treatment I have received following the cancellation of my upcoming flight. Upon the cancellation, I was rebooked on an alternative flight that is completely unsuitable for my needs. Seeking assistance, I reached out to the customer service center, hoping for a solution. To my dismay, I encountered inflexibility, misinformation and deception. Such disregard is simply unacceptable, especially when facing circumstances beyond my control.

### "cancelled without a proper reason"
Not Verified |  Flight cancelled without a proper reason. No way to get help after being cancelled, the chatbox is AI, it didn’t help at all. No one picked up the phone from the call centre. No compensation after the journey is highly disrupted. An email from the airlines said there is a voucher for food and drink automatically available on my boarding pass, but it is not available and I tried many shops which listed on the website provided. My flight was cancelled without any reason and it was cancelled 1 day before departure. However, there are 4 flights from Berlin to Brussels on 3 July. Except for my flight, the rest 3 flights are not cancelled, so obviously it is not bad weather conditions or strike.

### "not even water is served"
Easily the worst airline of the Lufthansa group, not even water is served. Luggage policy leads to delays as they asked a lot of people to check in the luggage leading to a delay and then the luggage racks were free. At other Lufthansa group airlines you can pay with miles for the buy on board. Also delay, personal experience, are more frequent. On the flight I was reviewing my seat pocket was broken.

### "never had any serious issues"
Brussels-Barcelona return. I have never had any serious issues with this airline so far and I have flown several times with them. Outbound leg arrived with about 40 minutes delay in Barcelona due to late arrival of the plane in Brussels. Return flight was on time. As always, very pleasant, professional and pro-active crew on both flights. Their food and drink choices are good value as well! The ticket that I bought was the cheapest on those dates.

### "unacceptable sales practices"
When i used the web portal of brussels airlines for purchase, i noticed that each time the web page was reloaded, the prices went up. Since the payment procedure each time got blocked (issue with the backend server that brussels airline side), and the purchase procedure had to be restarted, the price of the particular flight i wanted to book went up from 223 Euro to 248 Euros. This looks like unacceptable sales practices to drive up the prices of the flight.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Based in Brussels, I have no choice but to fly Brussels Airline for business trips. While it’s priced similar to Lufthansa, Austrian, Swiss (all part of the same group), it is the step child / black sheep of the group and is more like EasyJet or RyanAir. 4 out of 5 flights are delayed. They run very few flights and given the popularity of Brussels as the European capital coupled with their monopoly in Belgium, flights are generally full. Your cabin luggage is more likely to be checked in than with any other “normal” airline. You’ll wait a long time to collect your luggage. I’ve often waited over an hour. They cite lack of labor as a reason. 5. Their ground staff have no compassion or sense of customer service. Nothing is free on the flight, a small bottle of water will run you €4. Brussels airline operates like a discount airline, and the only different between it and them are that they are cheaper. if possible.

### "professional and friendly"
Excellent crew, very professional and friendly. Although flight fully booked, departed on time. Connecting flights for passengers announced before landing. Baggage arrived even before I reached baggage claim. Brussels Airlines did an excellent job.

### "Terrible unhelpful staff"
Terrible unhelpful staff. Since checking the passport, the staff was rude and impolite, quite even as rude if you are a foreign, we arrived 40 min later. Too long times to waste, really bad experience with this airline!

### "company does not give lunch vouchers"
My first flight was delayed so I missed the connecting one. A customer representative met me at the gate, told me that I will get an SMS/email with the rerouting and that I can talk to the customer service kiosk. He gave me a new boarding pass and ran away without waiting for my response. Upon examination, it turned out that the boarding pass was for another person (no authentication procedure). The customer service kiosk informed me that I should come tomorrow because it was late, and their system was already closed. They gave me a voucher for the hotel and told me that the voucher includes food as well. However, the hotel showed me that they did not include the food in the voucher. The phone service told me that everything would be included in the SMS/email so that they had nothing to add to that. The new flight was in the evening of next day because all morning flights were booked. They did not give me the lunch voucher because “the company does not give lunch vouchers”. I took a taxi from the hotel to the airport. They asked me why I did not take the shuttle. When I told them that the shuttle was unavailable because it was limited to specific hours, they were not happy with the answer. Most of their representatives at the airport spoke broken English that was hard for me to understand.

### "extremely disappointed by their service"
I was extremely disappointed by their service. I am a professional golfer and was traveling for a tournament in Amsterdam via Brussels. My bag didn’t arrive with me and they said it will arrive the next day. I called to see if it had arrived and they said my bag was in Brussels so I drove 2 hours to go get it. Turns out it wasn’t there. I never received my bag the entire week, a week later when I arrived back at Madrid Barajas airport, my golf bag was abandoned on one of the belts. I emailed customer service about the damage they have caused but they stopped replying after a while AND I never received an apology. Truly disappointing.

### "like a bad low-cost airline"
This is European Business Class further in decline. My flights were from Heathrow to Tenerife via Brussels. While I checked in quickly, the boarding was a mess. There was a sign indicating priority boarding, but once announced, no attempt was made to navigate the economy passengers from the premium passengers queues. This meant a scramble with everybody rushing to board, which also meant delays. This happened on three of the four flights I took. Once on board, I noticed there was no curtain separation between the two cabins. Instead a small card with the sign 'Economy' was stuck onto the third row seat indicating that it was economy class beyond that. It was so cheap and shoddy. The seating has a paltry 29-inch pitch, with the middle seat empty - standard European configuration. After a long wait, we took off to Brussels, and a small unappetizing snack was served, with hot beverages in paper cups, and alcoholic drinks in a glass. The same routine followed on my return from Brussels to London. On the flights between Brussels and Tenerife, which were four hours and fifteen minutes, a hot meal was served both ways. One was overcooked pasta, and the other was a piece of chicken with mashed peas. Both were unappetizing. The wooden disposable cutlery made it difficult to cut the tough chicken. The only thing I enjoyed was the two pieces of Neuhaus Belgian chocolate presented in a little box. There were no refills for drinks offered and had to wait a long time for the trays to be cleared as the crew were busy selling food in the economy section. No smiles or any crew engaging with the passengers whatsoever, as they simply 'dumped' the little tray of food on us. Several of us in 'business' class had to use the call button to get a drinks refill - it was pathetic. This was like a bad low-cost airline with a tasteless meal thrown in. All four flights were delayed from 45 minutes to up to two hours.

### "delays announced with short notice"
Within 2 days flights from Lisbon to Brussels and from Brussels to Stockholm delays of at least 1 h, without any explanation. And of course, delays were announced with short notice before the departure

### "I would fly them again"
The service on the ground is very basic but friendly and due to local infrastructure in Africa there is not much they can do. On board they are very friendly and take care of you. They welcome you with champagne or juice. The seat becomes a full reclined bed, movie selection is not great but they have some 20+ options. They offer 3 kinds of entrees and 2 main dishes with some dessert and a wide variety of wines and beers. One of my options was not available but the FA made sure I would be the first one to be served on the second round and she kept her promise. Flight left on time, overall I would fly them again for sure.

### "such an arrogant company"
Brussels Airlines sells you a seat and then, two days before departure, sends you an email telling you they have given it to someone else! Their email tells you you can still change your seat if you are unhappy, but bad luck when you try to do so; the website tells you you must wait for 24h before departure. This company has no respect for engagement, leave alone for their customers; no wonder their financial situation is terrible, and who would be missing such an arrogant company?

### "one of most awful experience"
The boarding was late for 45 minutes, and after that there was a delay for 2 hours while all passengers were on the plane. The flight attendants passed by me while serving food without bothering themselves to ask what I want to have. When I asked them, simply responded “we’re sorry we didn’t see you”. It was one of most awful experience I had.

### "absolutely no information"
Not Verified | Didn’t even board the flight - was a terrible experience. On check in, all seemed ok however, the queue was not organised, resulting in me and my family waiting longer than others. Whilst this was frustrating, and not a good start, we remained patient and got there eventually. When checking in, the agent didn’t seem to know much about our delayed flight, nor whether she should check our bags and to where. Not reassuring. After security, we received a text to say we had been removed from the flight (baggage handler strikes in Brussels meant we couldn’t go there). We initially thought the flight was cancelled, but learned later it was not. Strange. Anyway, we had to return to check in. Once we did that, we were told we had to go back through security to collect our bags. At this point, I was starting to get angry. When we arrived at the baggage collection point, we waited for ages, and no sign of our bags. Even the staff there had no idea where they were. At check in, we expected to be given accommodation vouchers - but the staff didn’t seem to have any idea what was going on. No vouchers were available (rebooked flight was next day), and people were starting to get annoyed. There was absolutely no information from the airline and we all felt abandoned. Eventually paid for my own hotel - I felt sorry for the check in staff who had no info to give us. This airline treated us all so badly - there was no need for it. There’s no way I’ll EVER book with this airline again. They refuse to pay us compensation for new flights we had to book (in order to get home quicker for dogs), nor did they pay for our hotel, or refund our original booked flights. Never again.

### "a feeling like taking a local train"
Slow boarding as one lady had to do the check in for an nearly full plane. An old A319. A small and rather decent continental breakfast was served in business class, unfortunately with wooden cutlery and carton cups for coffee or tea; FA were very neutral, the faster you could finish the meal the better. No more small chocolates. Did not receive ice or lemon in soft drink. Not a pleasant flight at all - a feeling like taking a local train.

### "whole exchange was extremely unfriendly"
We were flying to my son's wedding. The visas were delayed so had to put departure back two days. Brussels airlines wanted to charge us £1400 - we could get the same trip elsewhere for £600, so asked to cancel the outward trip and retain the return trip. They started by charging us £160 for the both of us, and said they would call us back. They never did. When I called back the price went up to £450 - to keep a flight I had already paid for! I told them I had been quoted £160, but they would not budge. I refused to pay it and bought entirely new flights from another airline. The whole exchange was extremely unfriendly. I will never touch this airline again.

### "poorest short haul business class in Europe"
Boarding was slow - once again caused by passengers bring on far too many pieces of hand luggage. Flight was done in an old A319 . The service in business was extremely poor - simply scandalous. The meal was a kind of a basket in carton filled with uneatable vegetables - nearly duck weed with a few pieces of chicken. Wooden cutlery , and coffee and tea in carton mugs , bread was not fresh. The only nice item were the 2 chocolates. Brussels is for sure qualifying for the poorest short haul business class in Europe. FA did perform an attitude "ok we must serve you" and as fast as possible - no refill for my drink offered. Shame on you Brussels Airlines ! !

### "second one gets cancelled automatically"
Flight comfort is okay in Economy Class, no issue there. From now on I will avoid them as much as I can due to the following experience: I booked a return flight BER>BRU>BER, but due to my own mistake the first flight was booked for the evening instead of the morning. As there are no alternatives with BU, I booked a single flight to Brussels with another company and didn't check in for the Brussels Airlines ticket. If you don't check-in into the first flight, the second one gets cancelled automatically if you don't confirm with their services within a day or so. And the heads up is done with a simple email, on a Saturday morning in my case. I ended not being able to check-in with the flight back to Berlin, calls the support and just get brushed off, that I "should have read the fine prints".

### "I was being punished for being a vegan"
November 10, 2022 I traveled with Brussels Airlines and Lufthansa from Atlanta to Banjul. Two days prior to my trip, I called their customer service to inform them that I was a vegan and would like to be served vegan meals for my journey. I think I speak for many when I say my expectations are always low when it comes to airlines food. Gone are the days when you use to get decent meals on the air whilst traveling. So I really wasn't expecting much. Just a whatever meal until I get to my destination. Well to my disappointment, on all of my transits flights I was only served one vegan meal, that is unacceptable. On the Atlanta flight to Frankfurt, I was served rice with a few vegetables for dinner, which was fine, no complaints there. Then comes breakfast time, everybody was given their whatever meal and I was told that they only have an apple for me, "the flight attendance exact words to me were, "well you a vegan right, I can only give you the apple. I respectfully said no thank you to her. Everybody else was given their whatever meal which was a sandwich, yogurt and an apple. My flight from Brussels to Banjul, again I was served some nasty looking what looked like beans with some red sauce over couscous and that was all I got. For breakfast, they gave me and everyone else a big waffle which I didn't eat because I suspected there might be eggs in it. These airlines should do better in the ways they treat people. I went online and booked my ticket to fit my travel needs and at a price that was affordable to me. So when I tell you am a vegan, you should make the proper accommodations for me, this was a very long journey with very short transit time. It was very intense running from one gate to another trying to catch the next flight, I expected a better service once am in the plane. I felt like I was being punished for being a vegan and it not right. You must do better next time.

### "didn't face any big troubles"
I had heard horror stories about this company. I had four flights with them and didn't face any big troubles. Went to Prague from Faro, with a stop in Brussels. First flight was delayed for a bit more than one hour. It happens, who knows whose fault it was. Second flight was on time. Pretty normal, the whole operation and staff. Good luggage allowance for the rate.

### "nobody of Brussels Airlines did anything"
I tried to fly business class from Tel-Aviv to Brussels on Brussels Airlines. I passed security and customs and took a seat at the Dan Loune. At boarding time I went to the gate and boarded the airplane. There I found out that there was already some-one sitting in my chair which was strange. After reporting to the stewardess we found out that I misbooked my ticket. Never happened, but this time it did. As it was a night-flight I should have booked on the day of arrival, not a day before. Even though there were still seats left I was not allowed to fly and was escorted from the plane. From that point nobody of Brussels Airlines did anything. Middle of the night, left alone, no rebooking, no nothing. Only comments 'your flight has left, your problem, goodbye'. Let me be clear: I passed all security, customs, lounge and final boarding with a passed ticket! If anyone would have noticed I could have rebooked on the spot as I had a flexible business ticket! Brussels Airlines did not care about anything. Just kicked off the plane and left alone. Up to now nobody of Brussels Airlines has responded to my filed complaint. Calling is no use, they only state 'just wait our response to your claim'. I fly over 20 times per year but such a handling has never occurred to me. I know the booking error is on my side, but shame on Brussels Airlines in every way. I will never, ever fly them again.

### "last time I travel with them"
Not Verified |  We arrived at the airport in Israel to check in, some of the hand bags allowed us to get on the plane and some of them claimed that there was no room (actually there was a lot of free space). We got on the plane and there was no air conditioning, when we contacted the crew members they claimed that there is no air conditioning until take off. During the flight, minimum service, we asked for tissues, they bring you one handkerchief, a glass of water, they brought a quarter of a glass. In short, not pleasant at all! We landed in Brussels and suddenly we are informed that the connecting flight has been cancelled. We are waiting for alternative flights and then they inform us that they have a flight but to wait until the next day (it turned out later that that flight was also canceled!). There was someone who did "get" an alternative flight but he got on the plane and was told there was no room! We had a family event that we had to be at and it didn't even matter to them that the happy husband wouldn't make it to the event on time. At some point we asked to go to the management, an official approached us and told us that he would take us there. In practice he took us to passport control and took us out of the airport. Our travel agent arranged a flight for us through London, we actually arrived at the Brussels Airlines station and they ticketed us, after we arrived in London they informed us that Brussels had sent us on a canceled flight and that the connecting flight from London to New York was also cancelled. In short, this is the last time I travel with them.

### "crew was very friendly"
When I saw the airplane with the painting on the plane I was surprised and I love it. Brussels Airlines have a few aircraft painted in a different theme. The boarding was on time, also we landed on time. The plane was really clean, seats comfortable. The crew was very friendly. Only I was a negative surprise that for this 2 hours flight we have to buy even water, but ok that a lot of airlines do that. Overall I was a positive surprise with a friendly crew and a nice flight.

### "poor information from the cockpit"
The flight caught a lot of delay caused by the arguments about the luggage of one passenger. So after 55 min we were finally in the air. Apologies were said in a way "we must do it" unfriendly FA, poor information from the cockpit. You have to pay for drinks and even in business the drinks are served in carton cups. In Hamburg 40 minutes waiting for the luggage;

### "Worst customer service"
Worst customer service we've ever experienced. An agent made an error on a booking amendment resulting in us having to book an expensive last minute flight. We called immediately to dispute the matter and were assured we'd receive a call back shortly. That was almost 2 months ago. We have called a further 5 times to no avail. The matter is still not resolved. We will never be using this airline again. 1 out of 10 in generous. Would give it 0 if I could.

### "they assumed I would not return"
Brussels Airlines cancelled my ticket and did not take responsibility. They said they could not do anything about it and that I would need to buy a new ticket. Yet they cancelled my ticket without asking me if I wanted the flight, having travelled a different way to Lisbon, they assumed I would not return so cancelled my ticket.

### "experience was pretty average"
On July 23rd I flew with Brussels Airlines from Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport to Brussels. My flight experience was kind of average, my ticket costed about 600 Euros roundtrip, which was pretty expansive for an only carry-on luggage allowance ticket, but it was my fault due to late purchase of the tickets. If purchasing in advance, I could've saved 50% of the price of the tickets, which is a pretty good price considering it's not a low-cost airline, well, not exactly. I had an early morning flight, departing at approx. 05:00 AM. The flight was unofficially delayed. It wasn't announced but it did occure, it was a 30 minute delay caused by computers of the airport which shut down, not the airline's fault. We boarded rather quickly and took our seats. I found the seats to be a bit narrow. The staff on board was mostly friendly, especially one flight attendant which her name I don't remember, before take-off when I panicked a bit due to safety reasons talked to me and made me feel safe and calm. The other crew members weren't that friendly, average I would say. After take off it was asked of passengers near the window to close their window shades and let everyone sleep. So until 30 minutes before landing shades were off and everybody tried to take a nap. Fortunately I sat in an emergency isle seat (which I booked in the online check-in, for free) and had some legroom. I don't know how much legroom other passengers had but I imagine it wasn't as comfortable. Before landing a trolly passed for purchasing food and drinks. I ordered a coffee which was dull and not tasty, I think all airlines in the end serve bad coffee, don't they? Overall my experience was pretty average, not extraordinary good, or bad. I would say to sum up that Brussels Airlines is to be treated as a semi-low-cost airline. They weren't harsh on their policies, but it is nothing like a traditional airline, and it was felt. I would fly Brussels again if the fares would be attractive, otherwise I wouldn't make a special attempt to book a flight with them.

### " I am still waiting on the refund"
Terrible service. My return flight was cancelled. I was left to resolve this on my own, I am still waiting on the refund for the cancelled flight being processed (flight was in June!) and redress for the expenses I incurred (travel, hotel and another flight). No-one has any answers. The forms on the website conveniently don’t work and their staff are abrupt, lack empathy or the ability to do anything. To date, they’ve now missed their own deadline of 4-6 weeks for a response. Just horrible.

### "worst airline that one can find"
Brussels airlines is by far the worst airline that one can find. They lost our baggage and no one took the responsibility. There is no one in the US to address lost baggages issues and even if you contact their Belgium’s office no one answers. Our trip was ruined; if I go back, I would never book a flight with this airline; it’s not worth of a penny. Whoever wants to waste money, go for this airline.

### "they lost my luggage"
I do not recommend to fly with Brussels Airlines, please think twice before you board their flights. I took a flight, they lost my luggage and refused to refund anything, they claimed it's totally my fault that my luggage was lost.

### "seating was comfortable"
Flew from Madrid to Brussels and the service on board was professional, courteous and pleasant. The flight was packed but seating was comfortable for a 2 hour flight. Drinks and snacks are for purchase in Economy. Prompt baggage delivery in Brussels was really appreciated. Only downside was the very lengthy check in process in Madrid airport. Only 2 desks for 150+ customers. The staff there, worked non stop but they were simply not enough to process the customers faster.

### "no response from Brussels Airlines"
4 weeks, no response from Brussels Airlines! In Brussels our flight was delayed for 3 hours, during that time we were bounced around between multiple gates with no updates being given unless asked. Finally, when we were able to board it was exactly 3 hours past our departure time, entertainment system didn't work, plane was not owned by Brussels Airlines and it was filthy. Landing to make our connection in IAD, which was already made very close because of the delay, we were held in the baggage hall for 4 hours waiting on our luggage due to Brussels Airlines saying we couldn’t leave? No clarification at all, just that we couldn’t leave without taking our luggage through customs. After 4 hours, no luggage, there was suddenly no issue with us leaving without our luggage? We ran to the gate of our connection on United which was booked with Brussels Airlines, flight had left, went to United customer service, they were no help at all and kept blaming everything on Brussels Airlines, so we had to sort out our own solution, ended up having to fly into ATL and get someone to drive 6 hours round trip to pick us up, the next morning! Nothing offered in way of accommodation, compensation or just a simple response! Only a call center that can do absolutely nothing! We ended up sleeping on the floor of the airport, with our 2-year-old. How is this not your problem? ?

### "canceled my entire ticket"
In June, my flight from DC to Brussels was canceled less than 10 hours before departure, and I was offered another seat a whole TEN days after my original flight. Given this insane rebooking option, I had to buy a new flight on the spot, at double the price that I originally paid. I requested a refund from Brussels for that leg of the round trip flight. It took like two weeks to receive it even though it was totally their fault. Finally, in July, I check in online for my return ticket to DC and the online portal for Brussels shows I’m confirmed on the flight. I receive an email to check in. I come to the airport 2.5 hours before my flight and apparently there’s some issue with my ticket. Brussels canceled my entire ticket when I requested a refund for the flight they canceled. The ticketing agent tried to help me and the line to the ticketing desk is the most ridiculous I’ve ever seen. Also, impossible to be rebooked quickly by phone - they need to call you back and can’t take payment over the phone. I have never ever seen an airline so incompetent, so understaffed, so awful and such a piece of trash.

### "Absolutely rubbish airline"
Not Verified |  Absolutely rubbish airline. Lost my bag on 2 flights already, which i can forgive since these things happen. But they were so rude at the reporting office, as if they had their own bags lost, refused to compensate for things i had to buy since it was lost 5 days and had all my things inside and then refused to deliver to my address like they promised and instead dropped it off at a bus station 2hrs away from my house. Their customer service are clueless and the ground staff rude. Not worth the cheaper prices,

### "worst experience in business class"
The worst experience in business class. When we came to the plane no water and wet tissue was provided. The food was the worst green salad with few cubes of feta cheese which tasted awful. Constant terrible smell coming from toilet cabinet. Worst business class in Europe airlines. Always delayed and started boarding late due to unprepared airplane.

### "Last time I fly with Brussels Airlines!"
Worst flying experience ever with Brussels Airlines! I booked a second flight because my planning didn't allow me to take the first plane. So I booked a second plane and paid for it. Then I got an email from Brussels Airlines: "We have cancelled all your flights because you were not on board". I called the customer service, they asked me to pay an extra EUR 40 to get my flight booked again. Last time I fly with Brussels Airlines!

### "It was my worst trip ever"
Not Verified |  I'm a mother of a 4 month baby boy, I chose Brussels Airlines to be my first travel with a small baby thinking they will provide comfort for me and him. I had paid for an infant ticket (around 100$) so they should provide at least a bassinet - well no! On boarding in Brussels Airport, I asked the counter lady if I can sit in front seat to have a bassinet as my baby is only 4 months! She apologized that there were no seats left in front. The economy class was full full and crowded, they gave me a seat in the middle where there were 4 seats! The seat was so uncomfortable. I asked the crew if I can sit in front to have a bassinet, they responded that they would see if the ones sitting in front would change places (but didn't see them asking though). Anyway, the whole flight that was 6.30 hrs my baby was in my hands (plus they stopped for an hour in Freetown to have some passengers on board) so it was a 7.30 hrs flight with a baby. The flight was full and I'm a breastfeeding mother, I told the crew I could sit in some premium economy seats which were empty to feed and then return to my seat but they refused! They weren't responsive at all, it was so disappointing, I ended up sitting near the bathroom to feed him! They asked me to upgrade my ticket and pay extra 350euros to sit in the premium! It was my worst trip ever.

### "Shocking service on arrival"
Shocking service on arrival from London Heathrow. An attendant shouted at the arriving passengers all African passengers this way. We were literally herded like cattle to one terminal. There was one very basic canteen serving hot drinks in polystyrene cups. I asked a very rude attendant if I could go to the main part of the airport to shop and enjoy a meal. He pointed at a "No Entry' sign and walked away.

### "Staff were friendly"
Brussels Airlines is very similar to Austrian Airlines: slimline seats, buy on board catering but having the benefit of flying to major cities. Anything else is just subpar. Staff were friendly and the food wasn't bad actually.

### "this flight was a real bargain"
With 130 euros for two, just hand luggage, this flight was a real bargain. I liked the fact that Brussels Airlines sticks to group boarding. Also disembarking is row by row and crew sees upon it. Adequate seating, snacks at reasonable prices, announcements in Dutch, French and English, and an on time performance, even with a delayed departure on the inbound flight. Didn't like the endless walk to and from the gate at Brussels Airport though. But all in all very good.

### "Food options (all paid) rather limited"
Flight was smooth. Aircraft clean and crew very friendly. Food options (all paid) rather limited. Lounge at Marseille has significantly improved its offer, and space. On the other hand, lounge at BRU (sponsored by LEXUS) was dirty, food was ugly, non-healthy and barely edible. Usual features (Belgian chocolates, etc) were not available any more. A stunning decadence.

### "Food served was rather minimalist"
Boarding at Frankfurt was on time but without priority boarding for business class passengers. Food served was rather minimalist but tasted well; far better than the ‘Foodmaker’ salads they used to serve. Unfortunately the cutlery on Brussels Airlines flights is nowadays bamboo cutlery which doesn’t give a pleasant feeling when eating. Why can’t they serve meals with metal cutlery in business class as other airlines do. They serve champagne in business class; a cheap one (Duval Leroy) but luckily one that tastes quite well. I was offered several refills by the SN crew which on this flight was surprisingly friendly where often SN crews can be really grumpy

### "below the standards of other airlines"
Check in was smooth and arrival and departure on time. Cabin crew was cool and uninterested. We sat at the first row and had a bit more legroom but seat pitch of the entire cabin is the same standard economy seat pitch. No difference in seat between business and economy as well as no divider curtain; only a movable sign marked ‘ECONOMY’ placed on the back of the last business class seat. Meal wasn’t great but at least better than what it used to be until recent with the uninspired Foodmaker cardboard boxes. Only good thing is they serve real champagne (it’s a cheap one but it’s drinkable though) and you get a small box of Neuhaus chocolates. Given the price paid not really value for money and overall below the standards of other airlines on European routes in business class

### "4h 20 mins flight without a meal"
Not Verified | The boarding was very easy The crew was lovely but that was the only good thing about this flight. It was a 4h 20 mins flight without a meal. The legroom was not good. And Yerevan is the only destination above the 2h without the option to buy a hot meal

### Brussels Airlines customer review
It was one of the worst flight i did in the whole of my life, I got the last seat in the airplane the seat was directly in front of the WC and next to the service area on the airplane so you can imagine how annoying this seat the hand of the chair was broken. For the covid checking EU certificate all the companies check it before boarding the plane, except Brussels Airlines - I had to go to the office to get the boarding pass from them because they don't let me check in online. Bad experience i don't recommend. Notice : if you have travel document check carefully which seat they will give you..

### "I recommend Brussels Airlines"
I recommend Brussels Airlines. The food and entertainment on board might not be the best in the market, but the company's staff is amazing and willing to fly the extra mile to fulfill customers' needs.

### "didn't ask nor check our Vaccination certificates"
Check in at BRU airport went smooth. The check in agent even didn't ask nor check our Vaccination certificates or necessary docs for Spain. Boarding well on time and smooth. Greeted by very friendly cabin crew. Emergency exit seats, space and comfort ok for a 4h30 flight. No inflight entertainment available. Crew passed 2 times with trolley to buy food and drinks. Have the impression that the selection of snacks is severely limited with Corona, and this for a 4hrs 30mins flight. Captain gave information before take off and before landing. Flight was on time

### "Luggage got lost"
Check in in Accra very unprofessional, no separate lane for business class passengers - Akwaaba business lounge is the worst I have ever seen, no service, no food, very limited selection of drinks, charging of devices not possible. This lounge is even worse than Adinkra lounge at the same airport. - Boarding ok - On board seat was acceptable, privacy good, enough space but the seat itself is not comfortable at all. Food quite ok. What I am happy is that flight attendant Olivier made an exceptional job, one of the best I have ever seen so far. Flight from Brussels to Geneva nothing special, not to be compared with some better airlines within star alliance. Now the worst: Luggage got lost. All of the passengers flying from different places in Africa to Geneva did not receive the luggage - The crew was aware already in Brussels, but did not care and started the flight, horrible pilot and organisation - Delivery of the luggage was finally on August 19 th, at 9.30 pm, after having several discussions with Brussels airlines and Swissport. The attitude of the staff of both companies was very rude, unpolite and unprofessional

### "It was a good flight"
It was a good flight and the cabin crew was friendly and will try to help you if you have a question. It was an A320 without entertainment. I remember having more leg space in the A320's from Vueling (low-cost) than I had with Brussels Airlines.

### "another unpleasant experience with this company"
The flight had a delay of nearly 40 minutes - that was entirely caused by the fact a large group of passengers from a connecting flight from Africa was boarding. One attendant at the gate had to do an inspection of all the passports, boarding passes and vaccination proofs or covid corona tests for a fully booked plane. All the passengers were taking far too many and too heavy cabin bags on board so some had be checked in as extra luggage. FA had to do a lot of work. Flight was smooth - at the airport in Hamburg another delay: 50 minutes waiting for the luggage - Once again another unpleasant experience with this company.

### "refused to put on his mask"
I was on flight SN3244 Kos to Brussels where a passenger refused to put on his mask properly before take off. They kept him on the flight and during the flight he even took it off completely without the personnel doing anything about this.

### "A complete disgrace for a service oriented company"
We had the most unpleasant experience at Copenhagen Airport. First of all, we have spent more than 2h waiting for the check in. Once we were finally about to board the ground staff announced a strike of baggage handling personnel. At that stage they have advised that there is no confirmation of how long this might take. Few minutes after this they called all passengers to inform us that the departure will be at 12.55 which we also confirmed once again with the ground staff. We removed ourselves from the gate in the anticipation of the flight. At 12.10 we return to the gate, only to find out that the flight has departed! You can imagine our shock and disbelief. I was not the only passenger affected. Staff were absolutely not welcoming nor understanding, her explanation was resting her shoulders - and that she was not aware what the other person at the gate conveyed to us. At this stage we were re-directed to the customer services of Brussels Airlines for support. After 45 minutes on the phone, the customer service advised us to visit the Ticketing Office at the airport. The only problem is that such office at Copenhagen airport does not exist. The nice gentleman over the phone insisted that the re-booking can't be made over the phone and whilst he seemed understanding of the situation he was still directing us the non existing ground staff for rebooking and the conversation was not helpful at all. The only ticketing services available were from SAS, but they re-confirmed that only Brussels Airlines can do it or else Aviator. Then we went to Aviator again, which has sent us to Lufthansa check in. The problem with that is, that Lufthansa does not have a flight till tomorrow and there is not one single person at the check in counter. After 3 h on the airport, and having spoken to more than 10 people at 6 counters we had no option than to find a hotel for the night and to book the earliest flight to Brussels - all at our own expense. At this stage not a single communication from your end. A complete disgrace for a service oriented company. I would suggest all football fans and all other to avoid booking with you. Our one day flight to Denmark to see a match has turned out to be a nightmare because of your non existing customer support.

### "The cabin crew were faultless"
Any thoughts that I had that my previous experience with Brussels Airlines was a one-off were allayed by this flight. Entebbe Airport handled the necessary covid documentation efficiently and the lounge was relaxing. Boarding was efficient and passengers were greeted by a smiling and chatty cabin crew. This was a night flight and one of the essential requirements is that the meal is dealt with as quickly as possible so that passengers can sleep. The cabin crew were faultless and within a short time of taking off we were being offered a choice between marinated beef or Nile perch sausage as a starter and chicken breast, cold with salmon or basil pasta as the main course. I opted for the fish and a rather pleasant Château de la Grave Bordeaux, preceded by a glass of Duval-Leroy champagne glass of Croft port at the end. This ensured four hours of sleep on a comfortable flatbed seat. The objective of any flight is to get from A to B – the reason for going business is to enjoy some cost-effective luxury and Brussels Airlines excelled at both. Excellent seats, pleasant food and exceptional cabin crew – it was certainly my choice for flying to Entebbe in the future.

### "This was one of the best flights"
I have never been on a flight and thought that the airline had got it absolutely right but on this occasion it came very close. Business passengers were allowed on first and there was a separate line. Documentation (visa and covid) had been checked already. The aircraft had very new seats and having done my research knew which the best ones were – even numbers on the right-hand side – which were window seats with aisle access. There are a number of aspects to the seat design which stood out. Although they appeared slightly unusual at first the designers have got it right. The table slid out easily from the left-hand side; there are two very convenient storage areas to the left and in front; the seat has numerous options and was easy to control; and the 4K screen was beautiful and was positioned exactly right – not too close and not too far. The attitude of the cabin crew was brilliant. They were efficient, smart and attentive but not too overbearing. It would have been nice to have been given a drink before takeoff although the seats all had a water bottle. Meal service was done by giving a choice of two dishes as it was served and all the options looked good. I opted for the smoked duck breast, meatloaf tenderloin and cheese. The wine selection was slightly limited because of the pandemic (something common with most airlines but they served an excellent French red followed by port. Being Belgium’s national airline there was a nice selection of beers – I tried the Tripel Karmeliet which was excellent. Leaving the aircraft was done efficiently and one of the advantages of operating under covid rules is that leaving is done strictly by row and so there was no mad rush to get off or a race to reach immigration first. This was one of the best flights that I have ever had and I would have no hesitation in using the airline again.

### "managed to lose all our check-in bags"
Not Verified |  They somehow managed to lose all our check-in bags (4 whole bags). They left them all in Paris. Their online system did not have accurate updates, so we had to rely on calling the hotline even a few hours to check on the status of our suitcases. Not as much as an email, even when they had finally located our luggage. Mind you, we were moving internationally and had all our belongings in those four suitcases. When they finally managed to find our suitcases, they said we would receive them the next day. The next day we called every few hours (since again they send no email notifications, and the website does not have up-to-date status ( it still said they were searching for our suitcases)). Suitcases finally arrive at Brussels Airport at 12:35 pm, and we were told they were to be dispatched (through the courier) at 5:30 pm, and we would receive them in the evening. After 5:30 pm, we called the courier to see when he would be arriving at our place so we can be sure we don't miss him. The courier informs us he was never given any bags for us. This airline company had 5 whole hours to hand them the bags and could not manage to get even that right. We called the hotline again and spoke to an agent who could not even explain why our bags were still in Brussels Airport, nor could anyone we spoke to tell us what exactly happened and why our bags were left in Paris in the first place. We suggested going to pick up the bags ourselves because at this point we had a meeting and there were important items in the bags we needed in order to prepare for the same. We asked the agent whether we could pick the bags up ourselves and be reimbursed for our Uber fare to and from the airport for the purpose of picking up our luggage. He said we would. I asked again, and he confirmed, stating we would only have to fill out a form, and we would then be reimbursed. So we did just that, filled out the form, and you guessed it! They have some cock and bull excuse as to why they will not be reimbursing us for our fair. They also refused to reimburse us for two of the luggage which they destroyed in the whole process. Luggags that had only been used twice prior to this trip. If incompetence was a company, this would be it.

### "Brussels Airline does not seem to care about passenger safety"
During this Brussels Airlines flight, several passengers were not wearing their face mask. I looked at how a stewardess talked to a passenger who was not wearing his mouth mask for about 30 minutes. Not once did she tell him to put his mask back on. It was surreal. At the end of their discussion, I asked the stewardess if she could ask the passengers to wear their face mask. I complained to Brussels Airlines by email, got an impersonal copy/paste answer after 9 days, explaining how their filtering systems work, how flying is pretty safe, and I was also reminded with hygiene measures. Even during a pandemic, Brussels Airline does not seem to care about passenger safety. I strongly advise not to fly with Brussels Airlines.

### "the staff impolite and the company a complete chaos"
I am not exaggerating if I say that is the worst user experience I have had in my entire life. They cancelled the flight due to corona, which is okay, but since then I am following up the refund of my ticket which still didn't happen. The service is awful, the staff impolite and the company a complete chaos which is obvious now under corona, the "corona" is a cheap excuse that airlines use to cover their disasters but now is the time when you see which are good airlines and which are horrible, in many ways.

### "I do not recommend Brussels Airlines"
I booked a ticket for my son. Flight was cancelled due to Covid. Fair enough, I can perfectly understand. I waited until bailout came and that this airline could start reimbursing ticket. I filled up a form in June, we are in October, I still did not receive anything. Customer service never replies to calls, never replies to mails. They simply do not care at all. Living in Antwerp, I will now take all my flights out of Schiphol which offer excellent service by the way. I do not recommend Brussels Airlines at all.

### "after 7 months waiting for refund"
Cancelled flight, ok fair enough, then refuse to answer emails, phone calls, or most social media chats. Then after 7 months waiting for refund, email to say it has been done, and will be with credit card company within a couple of days - still waiting. There is no intention of trying to rectify any problem.

### "They did not even bother to reply"
My round trip flights on Brussels Airlines from New York to Rome (depart on May 5, return on May 18, 2020) were cancelled by Brussels Airlines due to COVID-19. I filed on their website to request a full refund for this involuntary cancellation ticket on April 22, 2020. Up till now on September 8, 2020, I have still not received the refund yet. They did not even bother to reply my last inquiry e-mail on July 24, 2020. Please avoid this company.

### "Avoid this airline"
This used to be a very pleasant airline to fly with, but now we have had such dreadful experiences with them recently. Here are 3: 1. We plan to travel as a family of 4 to the United States in October 2020, flying Geneva-Munich-New York, and returning New York-Brussels-Geneva. The flight New York-Brussels is a Brussels Airlines/UA flight on October 24. We purchased the ticket online via a German travel agent. Recently, we received an email from Brussels Airlines indicating that the New York-Brussels leg of the trip had been cancelled. Despite extensive and repeated efforts on our part -- and despite very clear European Union rules in this area --, Brussels Airlines refuses to rebook us on another flight. They consistently argue that the travel agent should rebook us. However, the travel agent will charge us a rebooking fee of 49 EUR per person, a total of 196 EUR for a 4-person family. The European Union rules are unequivocal that the airline is responsible for rebooking. Brussels Airlines avoids all responsibility. A second matter concerns 7 travel legs cancelled by Brussels Airlines during the period of confinement March-June 2020, for which I am seeking reimbursement. Brussels Airlines has sent me on a repeated loop, in which the website tells me I need to contact them via Facebook or Twitter, and then Facebook tells me I need to make this request "via the website". Again the EU rules are clear: Brussels Airlines is obliged to reimburse. To date it appears that they are exclusively focused on avoiding their legal obligations. In July 2019, we flew to the US on a direct flight Brussels-New York on a saturday. Brussels Airlines did not manage to put our luggage on the plane. As our girls were starting camp on Monday, we were forced to buy replacement items on the Sunday. Our luggage arrived Monday. Brussels Airlines refused absolutely to reimburse the cost of the replacement items. Avoid this airline if at all possible.

### "They did not refund them"
In March our tickets were cancelled. They did not refund them, although they promised to do so in writing. All further communications are simply ignored. Test aankoop (a belgian consumer protection organisation) started up a file but they also ignored that. Even when the Belgian government bailed them out due to covid-19, they keep the money and ignore us. If you book a ticket, know you enter a lottery and can only hope and pray you won't lose your money

### "reluctant to give money back"
Gran Canaria to Catania via Brussels. They post on Internet flight that do not exist In fact After you Pay they send a mail, in my case to the agency, informing that the flight is canceled, but the flight stay on internet to make more victims when you ask a refund they are very reluctant to give money back. My flight should depart 6th of June, They say maybe give refund in November.

### "distance between seats is small"
Moscow to Brussels, the plane is standard, not large and very old. The distance between the seats is small, suitable only for not tall person. Inflight they give a sandwich and  drinks, although the choice is not large. The staff is good, positive.

### "distance for the legs is not large"
Moscow to Brussels. Anold A320, in the cabin there are thin seats, it’s hard to sit on them, the distance for the legs is not large. Meals are average quality, no choice, drinks limited choice.

### "flight was an absolute rip-off"
Brussels to Vienna. The flight was operated by CityJet. I was seated in the first row where legroom was fine but the width of the seat was narrow. No refreshing towel and a bottle of water after boarding which was the case until recent. The complimentary business class meal was a disappointing and exactly the same as the one I had on business class flights I took within Europe earlier this year. A salad in a plastic container containing mainly salad with a few small chucks of chicken and a dressing. The meal was served with plastic cutlery. Luckily there was a small box of Belgian chocolates offered as well as some cheap champagne that tasted OK. We left on time and arrived on time in Vienna so that’s a good thing but disembarkation was at an apron position so we were taken to the terminal by which took 25 minutes from landing to setting foot in the terminal at Vienna (this was also the case with previous flights I took to Vienna with Brussels Airlines). For the price paid this flight was an absolute rip-off.

### "avoid flying with them in the future"
Brussels to Barcelona. Despite paying a premium price for a so called flex ticket seat comfort and service were just non-existent. My seat was in the second row and I placed my trolley in the luggage bin above me. A flight attendant saw this and got angry and told this bin was reserved exclusively for business class passengers seated in the first row. He took my trolley out and placed it in a bin further down the aeroplane. At the end of embarking bins in the front were still as good as empty and were filled with bags of passengers seated in the back of the plane. After arrival I had to wait and run into disembarking passengers to get my trolley. Luckily the flight left on time and that was about the only good thing. Seating in row 2 was very cramped and for having paid a premium price even no glass of water was offered on this 2 hour flight. The crew just couldn’t be more unfriendly. I’ll just try to avoid flying with them in the future.

### "require some improvements"
Berlin to Brussels. I bought 'Economy Check & Go' ticket for about 99 EUR (11/2019) and won't expect too much service for this fare. Efficiency during boarding was messy and not so efficient at all. This cause this flight with a EOBT delay of 20 min but arrived a little bit late in Berlin TXL. The staff friendliness was average. Food and beverage can only be bought during the flight (similar service as Ryanair), but there was a large variety of Belgian cold and hot dishes. My final verdict, this airline require some improvements especially during embarkment.

### "very rude ground staff"
Milan to Birmingham via Brussels. After avoiding the airline for many years due to bad experience I had in the past, I decided to give it a try again for a flight from Milan to Birmingham (UK) through Brussels. Experience was horrible, in particular very rude ground staff - airline is back on my black list, and that for a good reason. Flight in Milan got delayed due to miscommunication between the airline and the tower in Malpensa, resulting in a late arrival in Brussels. Flight attendant from Milan to Brussels was really nice and professional, confirmed even at arrival in Brussels that this was an issue caused by the airline. Did a sprint from the arrival gate to the departure gate for the flight to BHX, which was still open when I got there, as they were waiting for a connecting passenger from Prague. But Brussels Airlines had pro-actively re-booked on a later flight in the meantime, so they denied boarding. The gate agent tried to put me back on the flight, but failed due to any unknown reason. Instead of putting her best foot forward to get me on the flight - the later flight was not an option, as arrival was past the scheduled business meeting - she told me rudely to go to a re-booking desk and try to get the ticket fixed there. I was not supposed to get over to the departure gate anyhow in such short time. Result: missed the flight, had to fly to LHR and rent a car to get the BHX in time. When I filed a refund claim (EU regulation) they denied due to reason beyond their control.

### "absolutely not value for money"
Brussels to Barcelona. The A319 was a former Air Berlin aircraft with an Air Berlin interior and a Eurowings exterior. I sat on the second row and seating was really cramped preventing me from hardly moving my legs. Where in the past SN still handed out a refreshing towel and a bottle of water at departure to business class passengers nothing was handed out anymore. The complimentary meal offered was a disappointing salad in a plastic container consisting mainly of salad with a few small chucks of chicken and dressing. Luckily champagne was still available on request; although not a premium brand the Duval Leroy champagne served is good (it’s the same Swiss serve on their business class). A small box of Belgian chocolates was handed out as well. The crew was nice and friendly but this has to be obvious when serving business class passengers. Overall the service of European business class just seems to go downhill with cramped seating an rather appalling food. For the price paid this is absolutely not value for money.

### "Would never take again for a long flight"
Not Verified |  Lisbon to Geneva via Brussels with Brussels Airlines. Flight attendants were strict and unhappy. No snacks or water served on 3 hour flight. Everything served was extremely expensive and unreasonable. Had to personally go to cabin to get cup of water. Would never take again for a long flight. Landing was very unsatisfactory, very bumpy and wing tipped.

### "no show for my first flight"
I have never been so disgusted and disappointed with the customer service I received from Brussels Airlines. I took my flight from Edinburgh to Brussels with no issue, I checked in online and the representative scanned my boarding pass. The flight was fine, but what I experienced after was a complete disaster. My return flight (with brussels airline) was scheduled for 2 days later. 24 hours before my return flight I received an email saying that because I did not board my first flight, my return flight had been cancelled. I was super confused as I did take my first flight and was now in Belgium without a flight home. I called the customer service line and was connected to a call centre in India. I told the representative over the phone what had happened, thinking there was a mistake, they would apologize and reinstate my existing flight. I was told that I was marked as a "no show" for my first flight and, as per protocol my return flight had been cancelled. I told the representative that there must have been a mistake and that I was on the flight, offering proof, but they didn't believe me. They didn't know what to do. When I asked for my return flight to be reinstated i was told I would have t pay 40 Euros. I refused this option as none of this was my fault and the representative became rude and completely unprofessional telling me that I may have taken another flight. I asked to speak to a supervisor who also told me that they only way I could get my flight back was to pay 40 euros. I paid the 40 euros and went to the Brussels Airline counter at the airport the next day to complain. The representative was very apologetic and understanding of what happened, and gave me the information to file a complaint insisting that I would be compensated for the issue. I filed a complaint and waited for a reply. A few days later I received an email reply. The representative again told me that the reason I had to pay 40 euros to reinstate my return flight was because I was a no show on my departing flight. I replied and told him that I was on the departing flight. He was not apologetic, and seemed to blame me for the error someone made by marking me as a no show for my flight. He said I would be refunded the 40 euros. I insisted that I be refunded for my flights. He told me that I was not entitled to a refund because I was marked as a no show and did not listen to me in saying this was a mistake. AND THEN I was told that when I went to the airport, the representative told me that in fact I was on the flight and that the no show had now disappeared.

### "forced to put luggage in the hold"
Brussels to Geneva. Despite a half-empty flight, we were forced to put our luggage in the hold while there was plenty of room in the cabin! The staff did not want to hear, so we lost 45 minutes on arrival to collect luggage that returned without any problems in the cabin. Malgré un vol à moitié vide, nous avons été forcés de mette nos bagages en soutes alors qu il y avait toute la place en cabine! Le personnel n a pas voulu entendre et nous avons donc perdu 45 minutes à l arrivé pour récupérer des bagages qui rentraient sans aucun soucis en cabine

### "Horrible experience"
I had a flight from Madrid to Hamburg via Brussels with a stopover of 40min on the 12th December. I only took what was necessary for me in my carry on. The flight was delayed 30 min and I was stressed because there was no other chance for me to go to Hamburg on that day since I was taking the last flight. I needed to be there next day early in the morning. When we finally started boarding the ground staff told me that i needed to check in my carry on because there was no more space in the overhead lockers. I advised the ground staff that the connection in Brussels was too short for the bag to make it on time to Hamburg. He assured me and reassured me that my bag was going to make it. When the doors were closed for take off there was plenty of space in cabin for many other people to bring their carry on. When I landed in Brussels I had to run to make it myself to the flight which was ready to go. so obviously my bag wasn't going to make it. Once landed in Hamburg I went to the baggage belt to pick up my bag and of course it wasn't there. I had to go to the baggage counter and fill up a form and then go without any of my belongings. It was so frustrating the next day because the time I had to prepared myself for my meeting I had tom use to buy more clothes and toiletries. The bag only arrived at the door step next day 8:00 pm all my plans were ruined by this. Claiming the expenses to this airline is a nightmare. i am sure their system is set up so people get tired of filling up the same details over and over. I had to do and re-do the complaint probably more than 7 times because the when you are in the final step to send all documents the systems says: error. Horrible experience with Brussels Airlines. Here I am spending money on international calls because after submitting the claim they told me they would refund me with the money I had to spend. However they did not receive the second receipt. When I sent it via email, no more replies from them whatsoever.

### "really disappointed in Brussels Airlines"
Not Verified |  Brussels Airlines made us dispatch our hand luggage right before entering the plane. I was mad but it was their policy so I couldn’t to anything. I was going to Brazil and had a connection in Madrid so I asked them to send the bag to Madrid, told them my name showed my ticked and all. I told them to only send that bag. When we arrived in Madrid (I was going to Brazil with my mom and dad) we dispatched a total of 6 bags and only one of them should have arrived in Madrid the rest should have gone to Brazil but they send 4 out of the 6 to Madrid I still don’t know where the other 2 are. I am really disappointed in Brussels Airlines not only did they mess up such a simple thing they are also very picky about which bags can go on the plane

### "extremely poor service"
Copenhagen to Brussels. This is more of a goodbye review than a review of one specific flight. Having lived abroad different places over the last fifteen years I have always stayed loyal to the local airlines to benefit from their loyalty programs and hopefully also get something back from the airline - as a thank you for always choosing them. I do not have a specifically high income, but I do have to travel a decent amount of time. That means I always travel economy, except from when I upgrade with miles I have earned. I was a member of SAS for many years, followed by a four year spell in London where I only flew British Airways. During those years experiences nice surprises like a little upgrade every once in a while. I would say at least twice a year based on 30-40 flights! On Brussels airlines I have experienced 0 upgrades in five years. I have qualified as “frequent flyer” every year I have lived in Brussels, which means I’ve always had 30+ flights. I am grateful for the lounge access I have been given in Brussels. But apart from that, all the time I have been living in Brussels I have not felt like I have been given the personal experiences, or dealt as appreciated as I felt when being a member of SAS and BA. I Am still living in Brussels, but decided a while ago to change all my Coming flights back to SAS as I’ve had it with extremely poor service from Brussels Airlines on a general basis. Rude staff, poor service, nothing back to loyal customers. I have it a patient try, but I’m looking forward to SAS which provides their plus program extremely cheap compared to Brussels business service, more miles, frequent free upgrades and better service in general. This last flight was the perfect reminder of the choice I have already done. Both legs to and from Copenhagen provided extremely poor service. No more food on flex and fast, and forced to check in my soft luggage with my laptop due to a full flight. The airlines can thank themselves for this policy..

### "A total rip-off"
Brussels Airline is awful. I always try to book Premium Economy on international flights if I am travelling for 15-17 hours - it has always been well worth the extra money. Have done so on Air Canada, Lufthansa, KLM and had terrific experiences. Brussels Airlines was awful. A total rip-off. Barely any additional leg-room, no amenities (every other airline provides a small pack with a toothbrush, eye shades etc) no water despite having a water holder, no blanket, inedible meal, surly flight attendants, and they don’t even provide milk/cream for coffee!! Seriously. Premium” and a cup of lukewarm coffee after a seven hour flight and you are handed a package of powdered chemicals. It was laughable. They treated us as though we had paid $59 and were making a short hop flight. In fact, I have taken $59 discount airlines in the US and had great experiences! I will never make the mistake of booking with Brussels Airlines again.

### "service levels below low-cost"
Budapest to Brussels. This airline has traditional prices but service levels below those of low-cost ones: there are no extra benefits, just extra problems. I flew with them for 3 times so far in the past two months, between Brussels and Budapest. First time (28th Oct.) we were near the end of the boarding queue with my colleagues, so they took our carry-on baggage on the plane to be put in the cargo hold. After landing, they never turned up on the carousel at Zaventem, until the indication appeared that there is no more luggage coming. We went to their desk at the baggage area, and after making some calls, they said that our items will turn up eventually on another carousel. They did indeed, about half an hour later. The second time (1st Dec.) we departed from Budapest an hour late. There was no apparent reason, boarding was completed on time. What is more, we landed with even MORE delay, which is quite an achievement since arrival times are normally pessimistic. Last time (6th Dec.), when returning from Brussels, by the time of the gate announcement, it was already displayed that we would leave 50 minutes late because of previous delays. At least that remained constant, and we left at the indicated time. I realize that some of these events may not be the fault of the airline, but the overall image is not great. The staff apologized every time, but we didn't get any kind of compensation for all these delays, even though our company is a regular customer (that might change now that we realized that flying with WizzAir and taking a shuttle to/from Charleroi might still be faster, cheaper and more reliable).

### "Hugely regret our choice"
Not Verified | Brussels to Rhodes. Hugely regret our choice for Brussels Airlines. We were going to go to Rhodes with our kids and their grandparents. However, Brussels Airlines canceled our return flight 3 weeks in advance without any force majeure. Purely out of financial gain. Our outward flight (with another airline) therefore became worthless. And now they refuse to reimburse those costs. Never experienced this with other airlines. You really can't do this to your customers!

### "a horrible experience"
My first time with Brussels Airlines was a horrible experience. I was travelling from Bristol to Budapest via Brussels in the early morning today. Everything was fine until I landed in Brussels. I had good one hour to go through security and passport check, but it did not turn out to be enough to get there without having to rush with my huge backpack. Apparently, there was only one security lane open - only 20 people could go through the check within 30 minutes - some people were extremely stressed out as it was their final call and they were only about to move on to passport check, where there were only two gates open at the time. Getting through passport check required another 20 minutes. My luggage had to go through the scan 3 diffetent times during security check in Brussels. The otherwise very friendly gentleman in charge took the time to explain how the cheese and the cocoa powder in my backpack looked exactly like liquids on the screen. He also told me there is generally no way to distinguish liquids from powder and cheese in the system without physically unpacking the entire luggage. At this point, please let me fundamentally question the technical efficiency of the security scanning at Brussels Airport. I managed to get through the security and passport checks (all of them! ), so then I had to rush through the entire airport to get to my connection where I could somehow manage to arrive 1 minute before the gate closed. I boarded to soon learn there were no more room left for my luggage in the luggage sacks - I even had to go and ask the utterly careless stewardess for assistance, who advised me to put all my belongings under the seat in front of me, including my luggage (of 55x40x23 cm size), my coat and small bag. Come on now, Brussels Airlines... Is there no place for everyone's hand luggage on a plane? Anyway, there will be no next time for me, because I will avoid travelling with Brussels Airlines in the future. It has been a terrible, stressful and uncomfortable first experience. I usually pick economy class and know what to expect for that price, but never in my life have I experienced such discomfort during a flight. The assistance, the management and the technical background were all lousy, meaning the company has failed to provide all important aspects of customer service.

### "abolished food and beverages service"
Vilnius to Brussels. Have to use SN frequently for business, because they fly direct to Brussels. My company policy allows economy flex, therefore it used to be my regular choice. Was astonished to discover that they abolished food and beverages service in premium economy without even warning customers. So for price of around 300 euros, one needs to buy even water on 2 hours+ flight. I think this airline deserves to be kicked out of Star Alliance and I will try to avoid them whenever possible.

### "lost me as client for sure"
Vilnius to Brussels. Traveled on FAST&FLEX economy not first time, and really was surprised that since now everything drinks, snacks are for purchase. As no any service (except fast track option) price available tickets VNO-BRU price was double that for lower economy class. In my opinion no more any value to buy this class tickets. Few weeks ago I used SASplus (economy) and I got food, beverages and even access to business lounge at airport for free. So, Brussels Airlines lost me as client for sure.

### "no consideration for families"
Brussels to Birmingham. Rude crew and no consideration for families flying with infants. We have a pram that is designed to fold up smaller than a lot of carry on luggage (a BabyZen Yoyo), but we were told at the gate that their policy is not to allow prams (strollers) on board. Lufthansa, their major code sharer, does not have the same policy - no problem taking it on board with them. Finally, having taken it from us at the plane door, it should have been delivered to the plane door at our destination but it went to the baggage carousel, leaving us to carry our infant through the airport. Very poor service - they need to update their policies and train their flight crew to be more courteous and considerate to those travelling with small children.

### "falling below low-cost standards"
Brussels to Warsaw. Even the expensive Flex and Fast is now falling below low-cost standards I’ve been flying Brussels Airlines frequently flying their Flex and Fast fares that always included a newspaper, a sandwich and a drink. Today, when I flew to Warsaw staff, told me despite the high-cost food and drinks are no longer for free in Flex and Fast and all is for purchase now. The ticket price was still as expensive as it used to be. Brussels Airlines are becoming a real disgrace with extremely expensive Flex and Fast fares and no service at all anymore. Next time I’ll consider flying another airline. Likely low cost may be better as this is even above the current Brussels Airlines standards. This used to be a good airline but they have fallen completely to the bottom and are really the worst I know

### "staff was kind, attentive"
Copenhagen to Entebbe via Brussels, our trip with them was amazing. At the check-in counter the staff was so incredibly kind to put priority labels on all our of bags, even though only one in our group of four was entitled to it. A member in our group was in the need of wheel chair service and the staff was kind, attentive and service minded. Our group was transported from gate to gate with a smile. On the flight a member of our group could not eat the food they served, because it contained tomatoes and she’s allergic. We did not inform Brussels Airlines about this prior to our trip, so they had no way of being prepared for this. However, alternative food was presented by friendly and service minded staff. All in all we are super happy that we chose Brussels Airlines and will definitely do it again!

### "Awful experience"
Washington to Entebbe via Brussels. Awful experience with Brussels Airlines - never again. Tried to pay for two extra bags online one way only for presents. Should have been $154 each with discount online, but they charged $200 each. Then the computer had a glitch and an email showed one extra bag to Uganda and two coming back. But the website confirmed four bags - two extra to Uganda. Computer was flawed because the three bags shown in the email would have cost $554 instead of the $400 paid. Called Brussels Airlines in Brussels and they confirmed there were four bags (two extra) Washington to Uganda on the website but this later disappeared. Brussels Air manager in Dulles said computer no longer showed either of the two extra bags Washington to Brussels to Uganda. He said pay another $400 and they would refund. But they didn't refund and wouldn't answer inquiries about the claim several weeks later. Then they lost the bags in Brussels for two days and failed to track them on the computer when found. The Dulles baggage agent said Brussels Air is the worst handling baggage and might lose them for a week or two. I called Brussels again and found they were on their way to Uganda. Six hours after my call they were still shown as lost on the computer. Bags came a day late and we had to pay a taxi $200 to transfer them across the country to our destination. On return the Brussels - Washington trip was cancelled at the last minute after departure from Entebbe and they tried to send us through Frankfurt instead of switching to United/Brussels to DC. We complained and they permitted the United flight. But we had paid for economy plus and United didn't respect that so we had to pay again. We put in a claim on the day of departure from DC for the double charge on excess baggage but they didn't respond, and when we called after some weeks still didn't respond in spite of promises by the phone rep. They also didn't respond to a request to refund the economy plus fee for the cancelled flight Brussels to Washington, even though the replacement airline (United) didn't recognize the payment to them and charged it again. Their airport reps were friendly and helpful but the Brussels organization is extremely inefficient. They still use the bankrupt Sabena identifier SN. A Belgian friend said Sabena meant "Such a Bad Experience - Never Again. They seem to be keeping up that tradition. This experience was for my wife, though I made the payments and called Brussels in vain attempts to rectify the double charges of $800 on two extra bags to Uganda.

### "I was very stressed"
Copenhagen to Basel via Brussels. If you have connecting flights, be sure you have enough time between them. The fly from Copenhagen was delayed more than 45-minutes. I was very stressed if I will be able to catch my next flight.

### "Always an excuse"
Roma to Brussels, departure 10 mins late. Late again. Always an excuse. One time is because the aircraft arrived late, the other is because passengers took too long to board, one more because there’s a lot of traffic.

### "more like a low cost budget line"
I do not understand anyone purchasing a business class ticket with Brussels Airlines. The business had exactly the same seats as economy. The promise was that a spare seat would be left to give passengers more room. The flight was full, so every place was taken (this is probably always the case) and no difference between business and economy! Due to the airline having to remove luggage from the hold, we were held up for an hour on the plane and we were not offered a drink! I’ve never travelled in any business class where I haven’t been served a drink before take off. On this flight, as soon as take off was done the staff pulled the little cabin curtain and had a coffee together. Some crew had boarded the plane and were all sat in the business section which added to the “no spare seat” situation. It was at least 15 minutes before they started organising the service! There are no staff designated to business so you wait the same for service as in economy except you are served your meal first,  but need to attract attention thereafter if you need anything else. We were served a hot meal .. no choice at all, just handed a box. Not even on a tray with salt and pepper, a cup for coffee or a cheese and biscuit. Just the hot meal in its container and a knife and fork in a small packet. The meal ( mainly potatoes with a few sad pieces of beef) is worth about €11 to purchase in economy, and for that you have a choice! In economy if you buy wine it will cost you €6 and you get a bottle. In business we were served from an open bottle. I can honestly say I am glad that I got my business ticket by bidding to pay €50 more, and that I didn’t pay the incredible price of a normal business ticket on Brussels airlines. Business tickets under this system of bidding, by the way, do not give access to the business lounge in the airport- for that you have to pay €30 per person more. Needless to say I cancelled my bid for a business class upgrade for the return trip. The return was in economy one week later on Thursday 17th October (flight number SN3855). This is supposed to be a national airline or at least represents Belgium in airline terms. It operates more like a low cost budget line. We got on the plane, which was filthy, in Marrakesh. 30 minutes later we had to get off in Agadir so went into the transit area. From there we had to again queue and go through security. Then back onto the plane. We were too early for our take off slot so sat on a hot plane for another 40 minutes. Half an hour after take off the attendant passed with activity books for children. It then took the three attendants another hour and a half to reach the back of the plane with drinks and food. Every time a hot meal was ready it seemed to take them another ten minutes to get going with their trolly again! They stopped to deal with every hot food error (there seemed to be a lot!) and kept the rest of the plane waiting. It was so heartwarming (NOT!) to see that the attendants were having great fun between them, laughing, joking etc. Any idea how annoying it is waiting for some service only to witness the staff giggling and messing around? A totally unprofessional incompetent and inefficient service. S

### "What a disgrace!"
The conditions in the airplane from Tel Aviv to Brussels and back were terrible! No space for legs at all, everything is old and dirty, no entertainment, restrooms are so tiny and very dirty, no service (which was not mentioned in the reservation). They didn't even serve a glass of water! What a disgrace! The flight was one big suffrering and everybody was complaining. We will never fly with Brussels Airline again!

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Warsaw to Brussels. I had a great experience with Brussels Airlines. Legroom and seats very comfortable. There was one disadvantage-no snack, you had to purchase it but they were good quality. I would recommend their service.

### "No food or drink"
Not Verified | Brussels to Barcelona. Worst flight ever. It started with a 1hr delay, no explanation. Then overbooking inducing more delays. No room for luggage. No food or drink (not even a glass of water) for free during the flight.

### "A disaster of a service"
Not Verified |  Flew Brussels Airlines from Brussels to Stockholm. Worst service ever in a flight maybe with the exception of one flight with Ryanair a few years ago. Personnel were an annoyance from the gate claiming I should check-in my luggage because I'd purchased some cookies at the airport duty free shops. Then they were late bringing us to the plane. A disaster of a service. Never again Brussels Airlines. I could never see value to pay more than economy. Now I can see no value choosing this airline unless I am forced to.

### "a very attentive service"
Geneva via Brussels. A great roundtrip with Brussels airlines. This time in their Business class with a very attentive service. On time both ways, prompt boarding, excellent announcements and articulated in a very clear manner. The catering was very decent for these short flights and the chocolate box to be taken with you is very appreciated. I have been travelling with SN for the past 10 years and never have i encountered a delay, mishandled baggage or mediocre service. It is always top notch! I am traveling approximately 10 round trips with them on an annual basis therefore I strongly believe I am in a position to form a very clear opinion on their service standards. While a negative perception can be generated by some fellow travelers if things go south, i believe it is unfair to judge them harshly by one incident alone taking into consideration it might have been out of their control. It is also unfair criticizing them for their buy on board product while their ticket fares clearly indicate the services provided. SN is welcoming, safe, punctual and courteous.

### "definition of unprofessional"
Brussels to Manchester. I would like to start by saying I have been flying for over 25 years. This past week was my first time ever flying with Brussels Airlines and it will certainly be my last. I will ensure I nor anyone I know ever fly with this airline again. I have never had an airline be as unhelpful as Brussels Airlines. My journey home started in Brussels. My first flight was through Brussels Airlines and my flight went from Brussels to Manchester. I had a connecting flight from Manchester to JFK and then JFK to Atlanta. In Brussels, I checked my luggage through Brussels Airlines. It was checked through to Atlanta (my final destination), but I was told once I landed at JFK, I was to pick up my bag at baggage claim and place it on a transfer belt in order for it to go onto Atlanta. Once at JFK, I waited and waited, my bag never came. I spoke with an airport representative in baggage claim who told me she was unsure what to do for lost luggage, my next connecting flight was boarding at this time. I have spoken with numerous airport representatives and airline representatives and no one can assist me with finding my bag. My bag never made it on my connecting flight in Manchester to JFK, meaning the last time I saw my bag it was in possession of Brussels Airlines. Brussels Airlines refuses to assist me with finding my bag because according to their system it made it to Manchester. I cannot file a claim online through their website because it has been over 24 hours since my flight and I cannot file a claim at the airport because I live 8 hours from my final destination airport and Brussels Airlines does not have a representative in Memphis, TN. 2 days later, hours spent on the phone, and still I have no idea where my luggage is. Brussels Airlines is the definition of unprofessional and I am beyond frustrated with how they have handled this situation. They are responsible for my lost luggage and for assisting me in finding it!

### "The price was very low "
Venice to Brussels, with an old A319-100. We checked in at their counter which was served from the S.A.V.E. group of the Airport of Venice, which treats you very sporty, no matter which airline their serving at that moment. As we had two pieces of luggage to check in and two carry-ons, he offered to check for free in the carry on which was not that bad so going through security and all was smooth. Boarding was kind of awful as we had to board by bus, and they got us stuck in the ramp which was under the sun and we had to wait like 20 minutes for the bus. Very surprising I saw that they had one row of Business Class without any type of separation actually, we sat in our seats, 8A-B and we had a good legroom actually and the staff was very attentive as they were speaking fluently more languages, English-German and French. Surprising was the In-flight service, as it was buy-onboard, but at least the hostess gave me some water for free. The price was very low we had a good flight and staff was very polite.

### "worst lost baggage experience"
Not Verified |  Geneva to Venice via Brussels. One of the worst lost baggage experience ever. It is one thing losing your luggage - but the follow up process has been even worse. The flight from Geneva to Brussels was delayed by more than 1.5 hours, leaving only 40 minutes for the transit to the plane for Venice. In Brussels, we repeatedly checked with the ground staff whether the luggage has been transferred on time. The gates for landing from Geneva and boarding for Venice were only 2 gates apart. The ground crew confirmed the baggage had been transferred, but we found on arrival in Venice that the baggage had not been loaded onto the flight. This in itself is a bad experience but worse was to come. The luggage tracking screen kept on showing that the luggage was still being traced for more than 12 hours. When I called the airline at the number provided, the person at the other end asked me to detail everything I had in the luggage - to the minutest detail. I felt it to be a very invasive procedure, and when I asked why he was asking such questions he said the baggage tag may have fallen off meaning the airport staff will need to open the luggage to verify the luggage as the one that had gone missing. I have lost my luggage on countless flights and airlines but never have I been faced with such obtrusive and uncalled for questions. The guy could not tell me where the luggage was, what I should do to follow it up, and when I asked about claims procedures he said that was not his business and I should call another line. What's the point of having a call line if the person can't handle any of the complaint process? Big lesson learned - avoid Brussels airlines at all cost (reading the reviews here losing luggage seems to be a very natural part of their flights), and avoid Brussels airport at all cost. Lastly, do not expect anything from the customer service of Brussels airlines if you lose your luggage!

### "has been the worst experience"
My experience with Brussels Airlines has been the worst experience of my life and I vow never to fly them again. They lost my luggage, denied me and my daughters boarding due to expired visas that were renewable upon arrival, and generally have the absolute worst, most horrible check-in (boarding) staff I have ever experienced in 41 years of extensive world travel. I have lost several thousand dollars being stranded in Brussels for three days while visas were (unnecessarily) renewed to board the aircraft. And the best part of all, we just boarded our new flight now and no one checked for our visas. They have expressed no remorse whatsoever. Never again.

### "poor in flight service"
A flight within Europe on Brussels Airlines is nearly always a synonym for a very basic experience matched with a poor in flight service. This airline cannot decide what they want to be : a regular carrier or a cheap one. So all together the 2 systems in one plane. Business and economy with service, and economy without service , that one with or without checked luggage. The catering in Europe is maybe the weakest in Western Europe. Plastic wrapped food and sponged style sandwiches are proverbial. Even a lot of plastic in business. The gate for this flight was changed to an area where usually cheap carriers and charters are boarding. After the controle of boarding passes passengers had to wait and stand for nearly 20 minutes in open air before a walk of some 250 meters to the plane. FA were very "neutral" with some necessary friendliness to passengers in the front rows - those who paid some more for the ticket. 30 minutes waiting time for luggage delivery in Hamburg. Even for such a short flight far from pleasant- if I can avoid Brussels Airlines I do not hesitate!

### "This is a terrible airline"
Berlin to Douala via Brussels. This is a terrible airline to fly by. First all in Brussels we were kept waiting an extra 35 minutes after we had passed the boarding pass check, in a room without access to toilets or food. When we finally boarded it took nearly 45 minutes to get everything settled for take off. When we got to Douala our luggage was missing for more than half the people who were on the flight. Brussels Airlines provided no information about this or what action to take! If I could rate this airline at -10 I would.

### "Appalling customer service"
Not Verified |  Tel Aviv to Manchester via Brussels. Appalling customer service. Didn’t recognise payments for cases despite credit card evidence. Then overbooked. Rarely answers emails and no information regarding compensation. Refuses to give information regarding legal options or ombudsman. Fails to inform when making payment then find out payment didn’t come in, despite airline being informed.

### "Very friendly service"
Brussels to Toronto. Very friendly service. They helped with our trip planning and were really helpful went it came to handling my daughter's peanut allergy. Many Thanks,

### "A very bad experience"
Marseille to Edinburgh via Bruxelles. A very bad experience with Brussels Airlines. The first flight SN3598 was supposed to take off at 13:20 local time and it did at 14:02 the boarding was delayed for some unknown reason. In Brussels I rushed to the boarding gate of my next flight SN2063, at the boarding gate I asked to check if my luggage was transferred, after verification the answer was positive.After the boarding was completed they had announced a delay saying that the luggage from the airplanes previous flight have not been unloaded yet and after that to load the luggage for the current flight. The initial take off time was 15:50 and it finally did at 17:28 arriving at Edinburgh  one hour and 23 minutes late and without my luggage that they have lost. I opened I file at the aeroport for my lost luggage and called the airline, they told me that nothing could be done at the moment and that I can only wait for them to find the lost luggage. There were several passengers in the same situation as I was. The next day I called them again, they checked and told me that they are aware of the situation, in fact none of the luggage transiting Brussels where transferred, they where still in Brussels. I asked to have them sent as soon as possible and was told that my luggage was not yet scheduled to be sent. In conclusion it was still is a very bad experience (my luggage is still in Bussels after 3 days), I recommend everyone to avoid this airline, the call centre answers after 30 minute, a very bad customer service that has no reliable answer for you.

### "scandalous experience"
Venice to Brussels. It was simply a scandalous experience. The seat was obviously not cleaned, quite some crumbs on it. Brussels Airlines is reducing its business class to experience lower as on a cheap charter flight. Ok, you receive a newspaper and a small bottle of still water. If you want a drink - a gin tonic - FA do serve you the basic items, only later they say that you can ask for the better brands available for sale in the economy class without complimentary food or drinks. The meal was just horrible: you get a paper napkin, plastic cutlery and a plastic box with some salad, a hard-boiled egg and a taste of tuna fish - duckweed is the best description. The piece of bread was far from fresh and hard, no single piece of fruit, cheese or sign of dessert. A small box with 2 chocolates was maybe the only edible item. Coffee and or tea was served in plastic beakers. You do not have any privacy by flying business. This is without any doubt one of the most terrible business classes in Europe. Instead of painting the planes in fancy scenes Brussels Airlines better should offer some decent food and drinks and ban plastic out of the business class. Spending your money on business on this airline is simply a waste in full. Just extremely poor and bad. To avoid!

### "Bag has not been delivered"
Business class from Tel Aviv via Brussels to Berlin. Brussels Airlines offers this connection, so should be able to manage the 55 minutes layover. Flight departed and arrived 30 minutes late, boarding for connecting flight had already ended when we arrived in Brussels. Business class is a normal row with slightly more legroom and no entertainment system. Good food on board. Hotel voucher was given for good hotel near the airport and I was rebooked on another flight to Berlin for the next morning. Waited one hour at Brussels Airport for the hotel shuttle bus. Hotel room was large. Shuttle bus in the morning at 6:55 AM, breakfast from 7 AM. No breakfast voucher, instead breakfast on the plane at 10:30 AM. One of two bags did not arrive in Berlin. One hour of waiting at the luggage belt in Berlin, no information by a company representative whatsoever. Another hour spent in line at lost & found. Bag has not been delivered for four days now. Customer service keeps promising tomorrow. That's what they told me yesterday.

### "cancelled one hour prior to boarding"
Brussels to Lyon. Flight cancelled one hour prior to boarding without any explanation. When asked at the desk, the answer was “operational reasons”. This is the most stupid and inconsiderate response an unhappy customer can get. Avoid this company as much as you can.

### "contents were completely destroyed"
Tel Aviv to Toronto via Brussels. First, they lost our bag. Then, when it was finally returned to us, all of the contents were completely destroyed. We filed a case online, to which they responded that they are not responsible for our damaged items. All they could say was we are sorry for destroying your possessions but there is nothing we can do. See the response below, and the lovely agent that took the time out of his day to respond to us. We have flown several times before with computer equipment and have never had a problem. We very thoroughly and tightly wrapped the equipment. I would never fly Brussels Airlines again, and hope that others think twice before flying as well. It’s all about customer service, and Brussels Airlines lacks tact and basic customer courtesy. They are absolutely disgusting. Here is their response: Dear Mr. Benain, Thank you for your message regarding your damaged items during the flight SN552 from Brussels to Toronto on June 16th, 2019. I do apologise that your items were not packed properly after the inspection. However, the Section 8.6 of our General Conditions of Carriage, which are part of the transport contract, stipulates that, for security reasons, your luggage may be checked or searched in your absence. If these inspections or checks damage their contents, we cannot be held responsible. I apologize again for any inconvenience caused, and hope we can retain your confidence in us.

### "experience was a disaster"
Trip purchased September 2018 from Greensboro to Florence. Upgraded seats purchased January 2019 Internal issues within the airline and the seats I had selected at time of upgraded purchase were assigned to other passenger the day of travel. At check- in incorrect seat assignment (was in economy) and check in staff notified. Told to check at gate at Dulles. Called Brussels Airlines direct and was told that we had been re-assigned to window and aisle but on the other side of the plane same number. At the gate in Dulles the staff were rude and told us some story about cancelled flight from day before and that they 2 flights going to the same destination at the same time and our plane was changed not the same seat plan which was utter rubbish, it was the same plane. We were delayed by over an hour leaving Dulles but we were able to make up some time so we did not miss our connecting flight. The food was appalling, the flight staff less than customer focused the entire experience with Brussels Airlines was a disaster - which was made even more apparent when we flew home from Florence on Lufthansa, a complete 100% difference.

### "Staff was very friendly"
Brussels to Bastia. First time I've flown with Brussels Airlines. Staff was very friendly. I could choose my seat for free and had a lot of space for my legs! The only thing i disliked was the price of food and beverages this is too expensive.

### "Poor service overall"
<✅ Trip Verified |  Paris to Accra via Brussels. At check-in they seemed really strict on allowing only 12kg of cabin luggage. But, as often, in cabin I noticed many people with far more than 12kg. No food or drinks offered on the Paris to Brussels. Poor service overall. I was not able to check in online either.

### "Neither of my flights was particularly good"
Freetown to London via Brussels with Brussels Airlines. Neither of my flights was particularly good. On the outbound flight I had paid for a specific seat in economy class, but the configuration of the actual plane was different than what appeared online, so they instead moved me to a bulkhead seat with no legroom. I ended up paying another $100 inflight to move up to their 'comfort plus' seats. These were very nice, comfortable and spacious, with large TV screens - and will soon be used as Premium Economy when the airline formally rolls out this new class of travel. On the return flight I had again paid for a 'comfort plus' seat, but greatly regretted it. The IFE in my seat wasn't working - nor was it on any of the seats in my row, or the row behind me. I had to ask the crew five times if they could reset it, finally they did, but nothing improved. At one stage one of the crew told me it was "impossible" that none of the IFE were working. The crew on my aisle were quite arrogant and unhelpful. Disappointed by my flights; next time I won't bother paying for any seat selection as I didn't benefit on either leg.

### "Both flights on time"
Catania to Manchester via Brussels. Both flights on time. Pay for catering available but not taken. Staff professional. Change at Brussels was straightforward, and luggage made it as well.

### "very disappointed"
Brussels to Saint Petersburg. I am very disappointed with the flight. The pilot landed turbulently. The cabin crew took my order incorrectly. The seat is comfortable enough to sit. Brussels airport, which is the base of the airline, announces the gate late that I have to rush there, given there is a designated area for Brussels Airlines.

### "disappointed with this flight"
I'm somewhat disappointed with this flight. I flew from Vienna to London Via Brussels, and the service wasn't great. The first flight left on time, and we were soon airborne. However, my window seat was disappointing, as the window was very dirty, and it was hard to see out. The inflight service was efficient, apart from the fact that they didn't accept debit cards, and I had no other way to pay. The layover in Brussels was fairly uneventful, and I managed to grab a bite to eat. After a while, my gate was announced, and I headed to the gate. I got to the plane, and I realized it was the exact same plane, and I was sat on the exact same seat. Dirty window again. After takeoff, the inflight service began, and again I was unable to purchase anything. After a very short flight, we landed into Heathrow, and I was faced with a 55 minute line at immigration, so by the time I got out, I wasn't very happy. I personally wouldn't take this flight again. The service was ok I guess, but I would rather fly on a different airline, as I found the whole flight and crew quite cold, and I didn't really enjoy the flights.

### "didn't have any service"
Boarding process from Toronto to Brussels was good. They actually boarded the people at the back of the plane first, impressive. Once I got onboard and prepared for my flight I found that the phone jack in the arm rest had a connection issue as well at the USB port to charge my phone. It showed charging but and I checked up on it 4 times during the flight and it was not properly charging. Worn out electronic connections. To get full audio on my head phones I had to manually pull the conneciton to the right and this was very annoying for an entire flight. Watched one movie and gave up on the rest. Food on the Toronto - Brussels flight was very good. Seat comfort was ok on the longhaul but the Brussels to Athens flight was hard on the neck on the A321. The main reason for this review was that Brussels Airlines didn't have any service on the Brussels to Athens flight. I paid a full international ticket at full value and I expected a meal and drink service as Aegean Airlines would have privided if they did this specific code share. Not even service of a glass of water for over 2.75 hours flight to Athens is terrible. If you buy a budget airline ticket for 40 Euros to 80 Euros like Ryanair I can accept this but not a full fare ticket with multiple Star Alliance Providers.

### "Horrible service"
Tel Aviv to Brussels. Horrible service. Even water costs money. Snacks cost money. On the cheapest plan, there is no way to change your flight, not even for a fee. There is absolutely no cancellation refund (except for taxes). I contacted customer service. They were of absolutely no use. I would strongly advise considering an alternative.

### "now not even a low budget"
I am a weekly traveller from Brussels to Nice return. Since two years Brussels Airlines is achieving in 85 % of the flights a delay of min 30 min to min 60 min. If you have to believe the cabin staff it seems always someone else fault of the delay. Writing Complain letters is useless since you always get the same letter back (automized). Its a lack of respect for the consumer. Shame on you Brussels Airlines! You used to be a premium air carrier, now not even a low budget.

### "45€ for your trolley"
Brussels to Lisbon. Very poor company. When they are not late, they will make sure that you pay (45€) for your trolley by stating it is not the right size. Their standard size is not standard and many of the bags you’ll buy as cabin luggage won’t fit. Most of the time you will end-up both paying and late. Service is inexistant. Food and drinks of very poor quality but very high price.

### "Nice clean aircraft"
Copenhagen to Vilnius via Brussels. The  trip was delayed by twenty minutes, but this was handled professionally by staff. Nice clean aircraft with good legroom. The food served was good, both with regards to quality and quantity. Cabin staff very attentive and jolly. As far as I am concerned this may be one of the best Business Class airlines in Europe, and the price was fair to what I got.

### "refused me compensation"
Copenhagen to Brussels. Not flying again with Brussels Airlines. After having a flight delayed for 5 hours due to operational reasons they refused to give me compensation. A colleague on the same flight, via a third party received the compensation. I did it the right way, via Brussels Airlines website. Brussels Airlines ignores my emails and calls, having done this for 2 months.

### "avoid this airline going forward"
Not Verified |  London to Prague via Brussels. Full flight and they allow people to bring multiple bags, my soft cover bag is removed from the over head storage and handed back to me so that I can place it under my feet - it's not a small bag. So much for any leg room. I will avoid this airline going forward.

### "service is very nice"
Long haul service on Brussels Airlines is very good and I now have a number of experiences. On the positive side, a number of things: The service is very nice, the crew being very attentive to the comfort of the passengers. Food and wine are always good and nicely presented. The seat is a true lie-flat which is comfortable and the design of the business cabin is quite intelligent as you have the choice of truly individual seats or having a neighbour. The short haul flights between Brussels and Paris has improved since one year. On the negative side, 3 things: the choices of films and music are both limited and not very attractive (I'm not speaking specifically about this flight but in general) and if the commute in Brussels is often a pain it is only because of long queues at immigration with no fast track which must be unique in Europe. And a true shame: there is no business lounge available in Paris even if Brussels Airlines could easily use their Star Alliance partners lounges in the same terminal (LH and SAS). A big cherry on the cake: the price of the business tickets are truly most competitive.

### "wouldn’t allow cabin size bag"
Vilnius to Heathrow via Brussels. The staff at the boarding gate wouldn’t allow to take onboard cabin size bag with laptop arguing the have limited luggage space in the aircraft. Upon boarding it was obvious that 1/3 of luggage racks were empty. Why?

### "seats were spacious and comfortable"
My first experience flying with Brussels Airlines, and I was impressed. The seats were spacious and comfortable, and I slept well when it was converted to a flatbed. IFE was OK, but there wasn't such a large variety of movies available. I enjoyed all of the meals that were served, and they were accompanied by a good selection of wines and beers - I really liked that they stock quiet a variety of beers, including ones from smaller, lesser-know brewers. The crew were all excellent - friendly, polite, attentive and chatty - they were proactive about drinks and refills, which was much appreciated. On my return, the flight was postponed for 24 hours, but the airline was very quick in sorting out accommodation and it was relatively painless. A good airline, made all the better by friendly and cheerful staff.

### "no more Brussels Airlines"
Brussels to Rome. Staff on board terrible, no more Brussels Airlines! I had only one Personal bag with me, no trolley, no bag pack, no luggage. Staff told me he would have helped me putting the luggage in the cabin, instead he sent it to the luggage belt without even informing me. I would have liked at least to be informed about my bag sent to the belt so that I could have removed the laptop.

### "customer service is really bad"
Zurich to Brussels with Brussels Airlines. If everything goes well, you have a nice trip, but as soon as something happens, customer service is really bad. They don't understand very common situations, move you around from one place to another, mail, phone. I had a 1 day trip, fly in the morning, come back in the evening, it had to be 2 different bookings because of these time constraints it seems. My morning flight was cancelled due to the weather. So I had to cancel my meeting and the evening flight back as well. I had paid the proposed cancellation insurance, so no problem right? Right, after communicating everything to customer service you are pointed to the website, then to email, then to insurance company, then back to email, then to another website form, then back to email. Nobody understands this very simple situation, each person knows only his very own confined set of rules and claims he can't help you. This is just really bad customer service. I thought major airlines were past these issues, but apparently, Brussels Airlines still hasn't figured this out.

### "an average experience"
Brussels to London Heathrow. It was supposed to be a short, 50 minute flight, but it ended up taking over 2 hours. When the gate was announced in the airport, the moment we arrived we saw that the plane would depart at 9:55 and not the 9:40 scheduled time. The reason for this was apparently "changing a tire", although oddly the plane was right in front of us the whole time and no tire was changed. As 9:55 loomed, the time of departure was again changed to 10:10, again for the same reason. We finally boarded the plane at around 10 a.m, local time, and departed at about 10:30 a.m. A gentleman sitting behind me lost his connecting flight because of the delays that we experienced, and the  flight attendant was rude with him when he asked for help. I was content with the flight comfort wise. The leg space was surprisingly good. I am 1.87 cm tall and i could stretch my legs. Same cannot be said with the service whilst on board. I tried to buy coffee and a sandwich, but they only accepted credit card and no debit card 'because of a fault in the system'. When i offered to pay cash in British Pounds, they refused. Not quite sure why, but it left me without breakfast. Also note that if you are a non-EU citizen landing in the UK, you will need to fill an immigration landing card, but bring a pen on board because to quote the flight attendant "we have pens but are not allowed to give them to passengers". All in all, it was an average experience. I fly this route almost twice a month, but it has always been with British Airways. My first experience with Brussels Airlines, and I think there are things they can work on and improve.

### "not provide the goods purchased"
Manchester to Entebbe via Brussels. We purchased flights back in February 2018 for flights in December. Three of us selected seats and paid the same day. My companion bought at paid for an 'Extra leg room aisle seat'. This was verified by the airline on an itinerary mailed to us. Over the ensuing months a regular check showed all selected seats moving around the plane for no reason and several long distance calls to "Customer care" failed to resolve what was obviously a computer glitch. We received assurances that all was OK and the seats would be provided only to see that the problem persisted right up to the date we were due to fly. At one point we were accused of not having paid for these selections and it took more conversations and mails of the Credit card charge to convince them that the error was theirs and we had paid for all six selections. So it came as no surprise that on check in we received boarding cards for seats we did not reserve. Attempts at the airport to remedy this were just shrugged off as were further attempt by cabin staff. In short Brussels Airlines did not provide the goods purchased. If there was a negative score possible on this site I would use it. Never trust them to perform the simplest of tasks. Happily the flight crew and plane were OK but the rest sucks.

### "did what it needed to do"
Brussels to Toronto. I booked this ticket as an Amsterdam to Toronto trip. It turns out Brussels Airlines uses the AMS to BRU airport rail link in place of a flight, which is a great option if travelling light. I wasn't expecting much from this airline, especially after the rigmarole I had to deal while trying to check in. There were a number of airport-related issues, and despite having booked in September already, I was somehow placed on standby. I was given a seat at the gate with no issue, but it was a concerning start to my journey nonetheless. Thankfully, the chaos of the airport was just that. My onboard experience was quite pleasant. Clean newish cabin, comparatively comfortable seats with decent headrests and a good entertainment system. Cabin staff were professional and helpful. It was confusing to be spoken to in French, Flemish and English all on the same flight, but that's Belgium. The food was tasty and was warm when it arrived. However, the speed of the meal service was not great. Sitting towards the back of the plane didn't help this, but it was still over an hour and a half into the flight before I received my meal. An interesting note, I was assigned to seat 41D, which is the first '3' row towards the back. This meant I got 2 TV screens to use, and a choice of 3 tables (two tray tables and fold out). There was also a bit of extra leg room. Overall, Brussels Airlines did what it needed to do quite competently. I would recommend a trans-Atlantic journey with them over a raft of other Euro and North American based airlines.

### "never fly with this airline again"
We took a round trip to Mumbai from Brussels. The flight to Mumbai on December 9 was okayish. The boarding process was rather chaotic with poor instructions on how sequential boarding is to be done. The in-flight entertainment system is poor (not much choice) and rarely updated. The food and beverages were just about average. On the return flight, however, SN602 on December 31, our experience was really bad. We had provided our food choices (vegetarian food and child meals), while booking the tickets. Thus, the airline had almost 9 months to prepare our meals. However, they ran out of vegetarian meals, which is simply because of bad planning and incompetence. What I was offered instead was non-vegetarian food; when I said 'no', I was offered just a plate with fruit salad and the dessert. I refused that saying that I had pre-booked meals for the family while booking the tickets. The flight crew was a mix of Belgians and an Indian. The two Belgian ladies serving the food just gave up and one of them was not even apologetic and just said - we cannot do anything about it. After a while, the Indian air-hostess came and offered me the child menu. Again ridiculous, but at least she was apologetic about the situation. The child menu contained soggy french fries - never seen worse french fries before. Secondly, the food service was started quite late during the flight. I have flown with various airlines for the last 14 years and from experience I know that on long-distance flights food service and trash collection is completed at least 20 minutes before the flight lands. In this case, there were people still in the toilet 7 minutes before the landing. I have flown with Brussels Airlines both to India and US. Although, the flights to US are not great compared to other airlines, I see a clear difference as to how the flights are handled and how the crew behaves depending on whether the flight is to/from India or US. The flights to US are a little better managed, serviced as compared to flights to India. This is not good! I am glad that Brussels Airlines is stopping their services along Brussels - Mumbai route. I would never fly with this airline again.

### "it was a great flight"
Brussels to Kigali in Economy on A330-200. Boarding was confusing: gate agents were yelling out rows to board but not many people could understand them because they couldn't here them. Otherwise, the flight was a smooth, physically and mentally. Snack of pretzels and crackers was served about 30 minutes after takeoff. Was okay, a bit dry though. After that, a drink service came, with a large variety of juices. Lunch was served about an 1 hour and 45 minutes after takeoff. Choice was Fish or Chicken, I choose Chicken. The meat was very tender, and was served with green beans, carrots, and potato wedges. The meal was also served with couscous salad, Brie cheese, whole wheat bread roll, butter, with lemon tart for desert. Delicious and filling meal. After lunch I napped for an hour, Seats with very comfortable, with flaps on the headrest to support your head and neck. Seat pitch was 32 inches(81 centimeters)very spacious. Seat width was about 17 inches(44 centimeters), so still not bad. Also watched a few movies and tv shows, selection was good but could be better. The magazine had lots of interesting articles so read, but I mostly read my own book. Halfway though the flight, we were served cookies and a drink service. About an 1 hour from landing in Kigali, we were served with a mushroom calzone for dinner, and another drink service. It was better than it looked, with soft crust and flavorful mushroom, though it was a little heavy on the stomach, would've enjoyed something a little more lighter, but I'm not complaining. Soon after, flight attendants served coffee and tea. Landed it Kigali 5 minutes late, but really wasn't a problem. Undoubtedly, the pros were the comfortable seat, good service, good food, and good selections of entertainment. Cons were the confusing boarding process, the aging cabin, and the late departure. To be honest, it was a great flight, would fly with Brussels Airlines again.

### "too terrible for words"
Not Verified | I have this evening flown from Manchester to Brussels to connect tomorrow morning with SN flight to Entebbe. Business Class. I fly a lot and have never felt so awfully treated. In Manchester, the boarding announcement called business passengers to board but a lot of people clustering around the gate were allowed to board and the 4 business passengers had to simply wait their turn. On arrival at Brussels, I first spent a time to find the lounge on pier B and when I arrived, it was just about closing. No other lounge available. I was directed to a quiet area with beds. When I arrived there, there were 2 beds, like beds in a refugee camp, and they were both occupied. As a passenger with no better choice of connection to Entebbe and paying 3 times the economy fare, I had to rest in the public area until 5 a.m., nothing to drink and eat all night. What a terrible treatment of premium passengers. I have never been to a capital international airport anywhere in the world where a business lounge closes with no respectable alternative for the price I paid. The airline agent suggested to go to the local Sheraton and I took this as an insult. Based on this experience, I shall never fly SN again or route through Brussels. Simply too terrible for words.

### "Excellent business-class"
Toronto to Brussels. Excellent business-class. I had a good sleep quality in the comfortable lay-flat seat. I skipped dinner/breakfast since I wanted to sleep. Coffee was served during approach. Service was friendly.

### "staff was very unenthusiastic"
Brussels to Madrid. Flight was delayed last minute, staff was very unenthusiastic, mid flight very severe turbulence occurred and flight attendant sounded scared when announcing to fasten our seatbelts. Once we landed there were technical issues with the gate causing us to have to sit on the plane for an extra 30 minutes. Might give this airline a second chance but did not impress me.

### "friendly and attentive service"
Toronto to Accra via Brussels. Highly recommend this airline for business class. I was lucky to get a 'throne' seat which offers more than enough space and very comfortable recline. Incredibly friendly and attentive service throughout and an overall very pleasant experience. Food was average to above average, but overall good. My only complaint is the very limited IFE selection that also seemed outdated. Other than that i would use Brussels Airlines again (and have so many times! ).

### "appalled by this airline"
Tel Aviv to Brussels. I am truly appalled by this airline. I will never choose to fly this airline again. They do not provide the minimal needs of the customers such as free water. After 3 hours of feeling very dehydrated and begging for water they provided a cup. I can't believe this is their policy on an international flight to have buy onboard in economy class. I am truly disgusted and disappointed.

### "more than one hour delay"
Brussels to Geneva. I booked this flight for a good price one month in advance for a Business trip to Geneva. I arrived at the airport on time, and so did our aircraft, which was arriving from Heraklion (Arrived at the gate at 4pm and was scheduled to arrive at 4pm). At 4:45pm (instead of 4:25pm) we started the boarding. The lady at the boarding desk claimed that the late arrival of the previous flight was apparently the reason of the delay (really?). Boarding was extremely long and everyone was in the plane at 5:15pm (we were expected to take off at 4:50pm). The pilot then announced that we lost our slot in Brussels. Later on he announced we lost the one in Geneva. We took off at 6:15pm and landed at 7:10pm, with more than one hour delay, on a one hour flight. Punctuality is one of the most important aspect passengers look at, even more on short-haul flights. Aircraft was clean and the staff professional. My return flight to Brussels took off with a delay of 40min.

### "crew was very nice"
This flight was surprise for me. I flew with Brussel Airlines from Brussel to Milano with Sukhoj Superjet 100, the operator was Cityjet. The airplane was new and the seat comfortable. The crew was also very nice. This was early morning flight so during the flight almost everybody fell asleep. The flight was smooth and on time. I would like to fly with them again.

### "not providing a little snack"
Venice to Brussels. Booked this flight, for a really good price. The online check in  was a big struggle, had to re try about 5 times to get my boarding pass on the iphone. As well to see my reservation, as I had to add a suitcase it was often not working on the app, but just from the computer. Once at the airport, the ground staff was polite and basic, nothing special. The best thing is that they board your hand lugagge for free, so you don´t have to carry it around. The A319 was  nice, I had good legroom, and I´m a tall person. Luckily i was not flying business cause the layout of it was not looking worth it. The staff in the plane was  polite and friendly. What´s disappointing for a star alliance airline is that they are not providing a little snack for a two hours of flight.

### "disaster, never again for us"
Not Verified |  Lisbon to Brussels. 8 hours before the flight got an SMS that the flight was canceled. After contacting the helpdesk an alternative: Amsterdam Schiphol and train to Brussels. The flight was 5 hours earlier than planned, but since we wanted to go home the same day, we decided to do so. Flight to Amsterdam delayed more than one hour. In Amsterdam it is not possible to take a suitcase because Brussels Airlines had put Brussels Airport as final destination on the flight tickets which was not recognized by the baggage service in Amsterdam. As a result, the train missed. Have to look for alternative: slow train that took 1 hour longer to pay 120 € yourself. Eventually arrived at Brussels at 1 am at night. The following day an official complaint was submitted. 1 week after returning home our suitcases got back, except our buggy that has never been found. After 3 weeks we received a call again to see whether the complaint had been received with the claim of the train costs and had already been dealt with. Nothing has been heard until today. 120 € and lost a buggy thanks to this company that profiles itself as "more reliable" than Ryanair. A disaster, never again for us. Vlucht Lissabon - Brussel. 8 uur voor de vlucht een sms gekregen dat de vlucht was afgelast. Na contacteren van de helpdesk een alternatief gekregen: Schiphol en trein naar Brussel. De vlucht was 5 uur eerder dan gepland maar aangezien we toch dezelfde dag naar huis wilden daarvoor gekozen. Vlucht naar Schiphol meer dan een uur vertraagd. In Schiphol koffers niet mee omdat Brussels Airlines als eindbestemming op de vliegtickets Brussels Railway had gezet wat niet werd herkend door de bagagedienst in Schiphol. Ten gevolge daarvan de trein gemist. Zelf alternatief moeten zoeken: stoptrein die er 1 uur langer over deed, zelf 120€ moeten betalen. Uiteindelijk om 1h ‘s nachts in brussel gearriveerd. De dag erop een officiële klacht ingediend. 1 week na thuiskomst onze koffers terug gekregen, behalve onze buggy die nooit is terug gevonden. Na 3 weken nog eens gebeld of de klacht met terugeisen van de treinkosten was ontvangen en reeds behandeld. Daar met een kluitje in het riet gestuurd geweest. Tot op heden nog steeds niks vernomen. 120€ en een buggy kwijt dankzij deze firma die zichzelf profileert als “betrouwbaarder” dan Ryanair. Een ramp, nooit meer voor ons.

### "contempt for their customers"
I have waited four months to post this for reasons that will become apparent. I was scheduled to fly on the evening flight from Birmingham to Brussels in June, the flight was cancelled at 4 hours notice and after I had left for the airport. When I arrived I was told 'you are booked on the 10.40 flight tomorrow'; strange as there is no 10.40 flight normally. I was offered no explanation for the cancellation and when I asked was told it was 'crewing problems'. I asked if I could go on the 06.15 flight next morning, they seemed surprised I knew about this and was told three times that 'it is already overbooked by four passengers'. I then asked what I was supposed to do for the night and told to go home; I pointed out that I lived a two hour drive from the airport and was very reluctantly booked into a hotel. On arriving at the airport the next morning I discovered that the 06.15 flight had also been cancelled, so two flights, one of which was 'overbooked', cancelled. A surprise then that the 10.40 flight was only just over half full. The result of all this is that I was delayed by 17 hours and missed a meeting that I should have attended. We now come to the really shameful part of this whole story. I contacted Brussels Airlines they day after my return from Brussels to claim the €250 compensation that they are legally required to pay delayed passengers. After six weeks and several emails I was told that I was due €250 and that I could expect payment in '4-6 weeks' - funny, when I paid my fare it took about 10 seconds. Well, six weeks has passed and guess what, no payment. I was also told that my original flight had been cancelled for 'technical reasons' and passenger safety; strange that they didn't mention that at the airport. I have been flying with Brussels Airlines and its predecessors SABENA and SN Brussels for over 25 years; they have always been at the poor end of the scale but this recent experience is a new low, they have nothing but contempt for their customers.Just for information, I paid £315 for the two one-hour flights between Birmingham and Brussels (by no means the lowest price I have paid over the years): for this I got no refreshments, no hold baggage - nothing except an economy seat. I am pleased to report that the response of passengers when cabin crew came round asking if we would like to buy a coffee and a snack was as you might expect. I have flown with around 80 airlines around the world, including several 'low cost' airlines, I would rather go with any of them before Brussels Airlines.

### "a pleasant experience"
London to Mumbai via Brussels. The gate agent in London was very nice and gave me seats in which no one was seated next to me. The safety video on Brussels Airlines was quite entertaining and captured the spirit of Belgium quite well. We were served complimentary breakfast snack packaged in a box during short flight from London to Brussels. My connecting flight from Brussels to Mumbai was on a dated, but comfortable Airbus A330. The touchscreen IFE had a nice collection of movies for the 8 hour flight, and I was able to charge my phone with USB outlet. The vegetarian meal served on-board was delicious. Since Belgium is famous for chocolates, I was hoping that Brussels Airlines will serve chocolates in economy class (similar to Swiss), but they didn't. Overall, I had a pleasant experience and wouldn't mind flying Brussels Airlines again.

### "everything takes forever"
Had a ticket to Oporto with connection in Brussels. The flight departed 1 hour late and I lost my connection. Had to transform a 3 hours trip into a 10 hours trip. They gave a connection to Geneva and then Oporto that made me spend the whole day in the airport. Lousy airline, doesn’t care about the customers, doesnt care about schedules, is always understaffed so everything takes forever.

### "decent budget airline"
Entebbe to Brussels. Nice clean cabin. Food was decent but nothing special. Free drinks and headphones were provided on the flight along with the usual selection of old and bad films. All in all a decent budget airline.

### "staff totally unconcerned"
Geneva to Brussels. Horrible airline, delay on both ends of the trip, one hour on departure, the next one two and a half hours. Staff totally unconcerned and the excuses are laughable.

### "no luggage was delivered"
Vienna to Manchester via Brussels. Lies, misinformation and appalling customer service. There was a 75 minute delay in Vienna with a stop over in Brussels for a connection to Manchester of 90 minutes. While on the Vienna Brussels leg of the flight I asked staff if baggage would be transferred to the connection. They told me to check at the gate. When arrived in Brussels there was a 45 minute delay on the second leg to Manchester. The staff at the gate in Brussels confirmed that my luggage had already been transferred, when I arrived in Manchester no luggage was delivered. I called customer service and was left on hold twice for more than 29 minutes. No answer. Sent message on messenger and got a 'cut and paste' robot answer stating the airline has 21 days to find the luggage. I submitted online form which took ages from a mobile phone. Other customers from other destinations also had delays. Thus is a cheap, low cost airline, pretending to be the same as a national carrier. I would never fly with them again. Avoid at all costs.

### "Avoid this 3rd rate airline"
Birmingham to Brussels. Avoid this 3rd rate airline at all costs if you want to get to your destination. We were stood for 50 minutes on the bus after leaving the gate, no explanation as to why. When I did ask the response from the rude member of staff was, technical issues, then 10 minutes later it was crewing issues, then 10 minutes after that it was safety issues. So we were then told the flight was cancelled and given a number to ring, 1 hour 30 minutes later on hold no answer. Staff at the airport were more concerned about passengers returning their duty free than offering advice or any alternative flights. I suspect that the real reason the flights get was cancelled was because it was only 1/3 full and it was cheaper to cancel than operate the flight.

### "cancelled full flight"
Not Verified |  Milan to Washington via Brussels. Booked through United for trip to Italy from United States. Did not see in fine print that United subcontracted out to Brussels Airlines. Brussels Airlines cancelled full flight at the time of departure! This caused the entire flight of passengers to get reticketed. There is one person handling for the entire flight. Four hours later, I was rebooked through a different airline and forced to fly into airport in a different state in order to get home. I submitted a claim online as this is the only avenue provided by Brussels Air to do so. It has been over six  weeks and I have yet to receive any communication from Brussels Air for the refund. I attempted to call and actually speak with a person - forget it! I called 3x and each time was on hold more than 30 minutes without anyone picking up. United will not take any responsibility for refunds either since it's Brussels Air despite their business relationship to this airline. Do not fly United or Brussels Airlines.

### "Not flying with you again"
Brussels to Geneva. It’s pointless to “apologize” for the delay and blame it on the previous flight if every single flight we took with Brussels Airlines was over 1h late. If customers bother to take the time to arrive on time you might try to do the same. Not flying with you again.

### "generated huge stress"
Not Verified |  Berlin to Brussels. Flight cancelled after 2 hour queue allocated to a flight 9 hours later. Said flight delayed. And in meantime they allocated a standby status to us which generated huge stress as we didn't know if we would even fly later. Cabin crew blase about the 9.5 hour delay. Nothing special about their treatment of customers at all. I can't recommend not flying with them enough.

### "cancelled without any reason"
Mumbai to Washington via Brussels. Onward flight from Brussels to Washington DC on July 10 was cancelled after all passengers were checked in, without any reason. The airline ticketing counter was flooded with more than 200 passengers. No help/reason for cancellation / apology was forthcoming. Rerouting was an extremely slow process took more than 5 hours as for most of the time only 2 personnel were deployed. The authorities would not deploy more staff. In the process most of the flights for the day left and all got tickets only for the next day. Ticketing staff were unhelpful and curt. Moreover, those without Schengen visas were not given hotels and have to make good in A hall with highly uncomfortable sleeping arrangements.

### "cancelled at short notice"
I regularly fly with Brussels Airlines from Birmingham to Brussels to visit family and recently their customer care has gone from bad to worse. Both flights I've taken this year have been cancelled at short notice with little or no communication. Staff have no clue, are often rude and don't seem to communicate with each other at all, it always seems to be another department's problem. They make raising a complaint as difficult as they can and very little is offered in terms of apology. Will take take flights from a different airport in future so I don't have to use Brussels Airlines anymore.

### "never take this company"
Abidjan to Brussels via Ouagadougou. I do not personally think that SABENA really deserved the motto “Such A Bad Experience Never Again”, but Brussels Airlines certainly do. You are warned. Never take this company. Particularly, if they foresee a technical issue. For the simple reason that they do not permanently have maintenance facilities and, even, a simple technician at the place of the technical issue. Therefore, if anything happens there and they cannot find by any technician hanging around by chance, then they need to send somebody from Brussels, which means by default a 24 hours delay at the place of the technical issue. Can you believe this? No? It is nevertheless true. They admitted it openly during the 30th of June, 2018 flight from Abidjan to Brussels, with a technical issue in Ouagadougou. We remained stacked at picturesque Ouagadougou for a whole day, because, by “bad luck” (as they said) Air France wasn’t that day at Ouagadougou and they could “borrow” their technician (as again they said). As to the assistance at the Ouagadougou airport (about midnight), well, less than nothing; we have to find by ourselves the staff distributing hotel vouchers, to find by ourselves the hotels shuttle busses etc. Does LH which proudly announces the Brussels Airlines participation to the Star Alliance is aware of all this?

### "Take your business elsewhere"
Lisbon to Brussels. I read a few days before my scheduled flight that a strike was announced at Brussels Airlines. I immediately called the call center and they suggested a flight to me at 12:25 am. When I asked which company, the employee answered me 'SN Brussels Airlines'. They are on strike that day? Yes, indeed, but it is 4 days later. Completely worthless and apparently the employee could not find a better option. A little later I received an email that my flight was indeed going to be canceled. In the meantime I had booked a flight with Ryanair myself: they still had tickets available on the day of the flight, but the Brussels Airlines employee could not or could not book them. A few days later I received an e-mail from the booking of Brussels Airlines to a Lufthansa flight 24 hours after my planned date: I could not do anything with that either. Once we were home, we filed a claim by registered mail: except for an acknowledgment of receipt, I was not allowed to hear from them, despite several reminders. The service they offer is now a copy of Ryanair: rudimentary and once it goes wrong you are alone: ​​a worthless service center and non-existent after service. Take your business elsewhere, that's what I will do in the future.

### "No comfort at all"
Mumbai to Toronto via Brussels. In-flight entertainment is poor, be cautious in selection of food at the time of ticket booking. Toilets are in poor condition. Not up to the mark for long journeys. No comfort at all.

### "Will definitely avoid "
I had a Brussels Airlines ticket Lisbon to Edinburgh via Brussels, and Brusselsto  Ljubljana. First flight from Lisbon to Brussels was nice, cabin attendants did really nice job. Second leg delayed, however still fine. The problem with Brussels airlines is their customer service. When I did my check in from Edinburgh to Brussels and Ljubljana despite there was an original departing time in the system, the generated boarding pass from Edinburgh to Brussels was with new later departing time meaning missing my connection flight to Ljubljana. You have to be extremely careful since the only information about the change in departing time was only in the boarding pass. First I called Brussels airlines phone number at Edinburgh Airport. They confirmed new departure time, however not being able to help since they are only an agent and not really Brussels airlines office. After that I spend several hours on the phone and have never ever before experienced such attitude form any representative form any airline. The first phone was to Brussels Airlines in Brussels. Male representative was the rudest possible, stating that I'm obviously lying about the situation, was not willing to help and after several attempts to explain the situation offered me an alternative, flying from Edinburgh to London, then Helsinki and form Helsinki to Ljubljana. He made a clear statement that this is the only possible alternative. Quite strange, since there was possible to get new tickets, much better ones, most of them even with Star alliance members. I refused. Called later Brussels airlines in London. The lady who spoke hardly understandable English confirmed the new departure time, however claimed that the flight from Brussels to Ljubljana, operated by Adria Airways, will also be delayed and that in such cases they are not obliged to rebook me to a different flight. Called Adria Airways in Ljubljana and they were surprised by the information about their flight being delayed. And in fact, it wasn't. She was the second representative of Brussels airlines who obviously lied about the situation. At 1 am in the morning the same day that I had a flight I called London Brussels Airlines again and finally got a lady on the phone willing to help. She changed my flight, even asked about the preferences, so at the end I was able to fly a bit earlier from Edinburgh to Ljubljana via Zurich. I've never experienced such appalling customer service with airline representatives obviously lying just to do noting regarding their responsibilities. Truly frustrating. Will definitely avoid Brussels Airlines in the future.

### "Customer service appalling"
Brussels to Birmingham. Flight supposed to land at 21.35, landed at 2am at night. No trains at that time, hence had to take taxi. 3 weeks later they still haven't even replied to my request for a refund of taxi expenses. Customer service appalling. Avoid.

### "not take Brussels Airlines again"
Not Verified |  Brussels to Douala. Agent was very unprofessional. My sister and I approached her to have our seats next to each other. She changed it to different seats but not next to each other. When asked, she had an attitude that we could take it or leave it. We left for our seats and realised that she had put the same names on both boarding pass. We returned to her, she never apologised and still had an attitude. I was very shocked. What poor customer service. So disappointed and will not take Brussels Airlines again.

### "they just don't care"
Brussels to Orlando via Toronto. This airline is a total disgrace! They informed by SMS 4 hours before departure that the flight to Toronto was canceled and postponed by 24 hours. No alternative offered, no contact number given. I am LH HON Circle member and they have several means to reach me for discussing options. Not so Brussels Airlines: they just don't care! It took me 35 minutes to get somebody on the phone and it took this person another 45 minutes to fix an alternative. Actually at that time only one option was left including a downgrade on one flight sector. In the airport, nobody of the staff felt responsible. The only thing they offered is to write an email using a contact form on their website. This airline does not deserve to be part of Lufthansa group. It should be shut down and buried for ever. Nobody in the world needs such an airline - total disgrace.

### "no-show on outbound leg"
Berlin to Brussels. Change of plans, decided not to board one of the flights on my multi-city reservation (cannot even be considered a proper return flight). Received an e-mail from the company saying that since I had a no-show on the "outbound leg" they had cancelled my "return" flight. Tried to contact costumer service for 2 days with no success (phone - no answer, e-mail - no answer, and facebook messenger - answer with same explanation for the occurrence, no proposed solution presented). Unacceptable. EDITOR TIP: We suggest to check Condition 3.3.3 No Show https://www.brusselsairlines.com/com/misc/conditions.aspx

### "total lack of care or interest"
I understand from thousands of flights in my life, things can go wrong. What I cannot stand is deceitfulness and downright lies. Brussels Airlines through their incompetence, made us miss connections (we went to LHR eventually via Zurich) and had to fly to our ultimate destination Myanmar one day late. OK, it can happen, however we were told three times 'no problem, your baggage is taken care of'. When we arrived in LHR the only representative of the Lufthansa group were some baggage handlers who knew nothing, everyone else was long gone (22.30). When we finally arrived in Yangon a very helpful Thai Airways staff member traced our baggage to Brussels. It hadn't moved and we had been lied to. Since then we've been invited to fill in forms, we've been asked for other forms of which we have no idea, the overall impression is of total lack of care or interest, just do nothing until the complainer goes away. It will be reflected in our future use of this group. The staff they currently have are unable to run a business and need retraining, if the front of the plane staff are the same as the others not sure I want to fly their airline ever again.

### "worst experience ever"
Toulouse to Tel Aviv via Brussels. The worst experience ever! Both of my flights! Delayed and got me to lose days of work. Losing my partner suitcase (hasn't been recovered until the end of the trip). Definitely wont be traveling with this horror-flight company.

### "Flight was cancelled"
Brussels to Copenhagen. Flight was cancelled. We did not get any help or information. The service was very poor, they just didn't care. We stood in line for hours with no help. Just don't do it, it’s not worth it.

### "canceled because of strikes"
I won't fly with this airline ever. The food during the flight is simply unsavoury. Then the first day of my Holidays, i received an email saying that my return flight was canceled because of strikes. I tried to call them 4 times before managing to reach one of their customer support. The guy did not find any ticket to replace my flight the same day (even though Malaga airport to brussels, or even charleroi, is certainly an abusively served connection). I asked him for my refund, as stated in their email, and they just told me to look with the website I used to book the tickets in the first place. So I eventually ended up having to buy an extraordinarily expensive ticket, without being sure to be reimbursed (for maximum a partial amount of the price). They just lost many customers, and forever.

### "Very pleasant airline"
Berlin to Brussels. Very pleasant airline. Great service and nice personnel. We flew on time. The extra service to offer me some lemons in my tea was lovely. Next time I will fly with Brussels airlines. It’s worth the extra km from the Netherlands.

### "quality far below par"
Brussels to Marrakech. Expensive tickets, for quality far below par. You get a the Ryanair service for twice the price. You will pay extra for every extra. You even have to pay for a non alcoholic drink, even when your flight has over an hour of delay. Ground staff was very unfriendly (typical bureaucracy attitude. Very bad experience avoid at all times).

### "No acknowledgement, no response"
Tried to buy one checked in bag via the Brussels Airlines website one day before our flight. Received the message that the transaction was successful. In fact they charged my credit card twice for the one bag. The next day in the airport there was no info in the system that I had paid for the bag. So I could pay again, at the higher tariff. On the way back from Lisbon the same story: no info that I had paid for the bag as check-in baggage. So Brussels Airlines cheated me out of 140 Euros. I complained via their website, giving all evidence. No response. I wrote to their Brussels head office, the only address on the website. No acknowledgement, no response. This was a holiday trip, but do you think I shall ever fly this airline again on business? It is about time that Lufthanse teaches them a bit about customer service delivery.

### "We were pleasantly surprised"
Brussels to Toronto. We had read a lot of bad reviews regarding Brussels Airlines and the service. We were pleasantly surprised by how good it was on our trip. We loved the food and the service was excellent and very attentive. What was a little disappointing was the entertainment on a long haul flight. There was a selection of about 40 movies and if you travel often this can be a bit limited on a long haul flight. Also our kids 10 & 8 were looked after well with a nice sticker book that kept them entertained for a couple of hours. The kids movie selection was even less, 5 movies max, but maybe mine are really spoiled and they have almost seen all kids movies.

### "a budget airline after all?"
I booked and paid extra for an Economy Privilege seat for my flight on the 13th of January 2018, but was not given all of the 'priviléges' that are supposed to be part of this booking. I complained but did not receive a reaction. I had to ask twice for an answer and finally received a 'standard' apology. Not what one would expect, certainly not as a frequent customer (with a frequent flyer status). I think it would have been correct to either: - refund me the extra payment for this 'privilege' (120 euro) - or offer me a privilege upgrade on one of my future flights. More in general: 'standard' answers by a customer service add to the frustration. So a budget airline after all?

### "poor food, poor seats, poor entertainment"
I have travelled extensively on many airlines and Brussels Airlines are the worst I have experienced. Quality overall is low, poor food, poor seats, poor entertainment choice, outdated planes in poor repair. On top of that the service is poor too, a fellow passenger had some dirty looks and loud huffing and puffing from a attendant for talking at a normal level while they were sleeping nearby. My interactions felt similarly unfriendly, with little desire to help, and much more interest in chatting among themselves. You will be better off with pretty much any other airline, I wouldn’t recommend travelling with them if you have any other choice.

### "disgusting lack of service"
They cancelled one of the flights out, after which I requested a refund. Instead of telling me how much i would get back as the refund for the inbound flight, they refused and said they would email me and process the refund within 15 days. Following this, I heard nothing so a week later called them. The lady again refused to tell me what my refund would be, and said I would get an email asking for my iban so they can give me the refund. They refused to let me talk to the refund department and refused to send me anything in writing. So then again nothing received after the phone call, I call again. Here the lady was apologetic and said I would get a refund within 15 days and she took my IBAN down manually. Then I got an email saying they do not give refunds until after a flight is taken, again still refusing to tell me what I would get back, (bear in mind in the meanwhile i had to fork out hundreds of €€€ on a replacement return flight with a different airline, did Brussels care about leaving me in this situation, no) but that she would send something to the refund department and it is in process. A monmth later and I still have nothing. Only when i called again and said i had opened a case with a consumer watchdog did they finally send me in writing what my refund would be. At this point they still haven't sent me anything back. It's one thing to cancel a flight, but to then string customers along and withhold their money and provide a disgusting lack of service or empathy in the meantime is beyond unforgivable. I have had situations with way more budget no frills airlines who have handled it tons more reasonably than these guys.

### "above-and-beyond customer service"
My partner and I flew out on his 30th birthday from Birmingham to Brussels. We did not disclose this fact to anybody yet pre flight during the safety checks the steward stopped to say 'sir I believe it is your birthday today', then presented us with some delicious Belgian chocolates and welcomed us aboard personally offering us a complimentary drink during the flight. We were so impressed with this above-and-beyond customer service. During the whole flight the way the crew interacted with everybody was first rate service. The flight there and back was very relaxing and smooth. Would fly with Brussels Airlines again.

### "worst possible value for money"
Berlin to Brussels. Being Belgian I am ashamed that this company represents us. 1) Delay: I have flown very regularly (around 20 flights last year) with them and there was always (always!) a problem. More than half the times the plane was late, from half an hour to 3 hours (on a 1 hour flight). Not enough time is foreseen between flights so a single problem during the first flight of the day and the whole planning is screwed. It happens so often that they have a contingency plan: a 0,5€ chocolate to make the customers forget about the time they lose. 2) Luggage (responsibility shared with Brussels airport) The luggage’s take forever to be delivered (often more than 1 hour while easyjet does it in 20 minutes at the same airport). My luggage (Samsonite cabin size) was sent twice to the lost and found for no reason. 3) service staff are very nice for business passengers, ok for economy class. Food on board is ok in business. Better than most airlines in economy (must pay). Seats in economy are similar to easyjet. Fidelity program is purposely unclear. 4) Price This is the worst part. The value for money is just bad. Expect to always pay one of the highest price on every route they fly. I value time and especially punctuality very high so for me this is literally the worst possible value for money. I fly a lot for work and I don’t chose the airline. I do see the ticket price though.

### "if possible avoid them"
Copenhagen to Bilbao via Brussels. After being a frequent traveler with Brussels airlines, because of this last incident it will be my last. I traveled with my small cabin suitcase and a small bag (allowed by the rules of the airline) from CPH to Bilbao via Brussels and just before I was going to enter in the plane, I was stopped by a rude staff employee from Brussels airlines, ordering me that the plane was full and I needed to check in my suitcase or otherwise they would not let me in. After I insisted that I had to layover for less than 1 hour in Brussels and the risk of losing the baggage was high they still forced me to check in the baggage. Well, not only the plane was not full, but indeed they lost my baggage at Brussels so I had to wait 2 days to get my personal items back. This is very irresponsible from an airline that claims to care about its customers. I was following their rules and they still forced me to check in the suitcase. If you are flying with them, be very careful with your baggage if you have a layover. And if possible avoid them.

### "Worst airline to travel with"
London to Douala via Brussels. Worst airline to travel with, 1 of my luggage didn't arrived in Douala during my holidays, it took them 10 days to find my luggage. What can I say terrible customer service, couldn't find any customer service number to call, I was told any complaint it's done online which I've done and it's been a month still no contact from Brussels Airlines. I will never ever travel again with this airline, how they treated me up till now it's unbelievable. I can't even call someone from Brussels airline to speak too, so many similar review as mine online, no contact, no compensation, nothing, It's like you are alone. I've spend so much money on my trip and was left without my main luggage, I had to use my spending money on buying essentials and going out outfit and shoes and gifts for friends and family.

### "stress, anger and anxiety!"
Geneva to Birmingham via Brussels. Worst journey I have ever experienced. As a frequent flyer, I have gone through a lot of weird, stressful and tiring flights. This one was the worst. Flight delayed, no information about the connection, overcapacity booking, useless and slightly rude staff on board and at the gates. The only things that came out of that experience are stress, anger and anxiety!

### "left Dakar more than two hours late"
Nous sommes partis de Dakar avec plus de deux heures de retard, l'avion venant de Conakry avait déjà une heure de retard. Vol avec escale à Bruxelles, nous devions redécoller vers 9h40, toutes les 10 minutes l'heure de départ était reportée puis finalement nous sommes partis vers 13 heures, nous sommes montés dans l'avion aux alentours de 10h40 et nous avons attendus dans l'aéronef jusqu'à 12 heures, heure à laquelle nous avons finalement décollé. Des passagers sont même descendus de l'appareil ce qui pose un problème de sécurité car sur le moment il n'y a eu aucune vérification des bagages restants, ce contrôle a bien eu lieu mais plus tard. Nous devions arrivés à 11h, nous sommes arrivés à 14 heures ! ! A Lyon, nous avons attendus plus de 45 minutes avant de récupérer nos bagages qui sont arrivés dans un état lamentables (ils avaient dû rester sous la pluie Bruxelles). Nous avons récupérer notre véhicule avec 3 heures de retard (frais de parking supplémentaires ! !). Nous avons donc émis une réclamation en date du 18/12, le 15/02/2018 nous n'avions toujours pas de réponse, même pas des excuses ! ! Un manque de sérieux, et surtout de respect de la part du service client. Nous avons donc entamé une procédure. - We left Dakar more than two hours late, the plane coming from Conakry was already an hour late. Flight with stopover in Brussels, we had to take off again at 9:40, every 10 minutes the departure time was postponed and finally we left around 13.00 hours. We boarded the plane around 10:40 and we waited in the aircraft until 12 o'clock, when we finally took off. Passengers had even descended from the aircraft which poses a security problem because at the moment there was no verification of the remaining luggage, this control took place but later. We had arrived at 11am, we arrived at 2pm! In Lyon, we waited more than 45 minutes before recovering our luggage that arrived in a lamentable state (they had to stay in the rain Brussels). We recovered our vehicle 3 hours late (additional parking fees!). We therefore issued a complaint dated 18/12, the 15/02/2018 we still had no answer, not even excuses! A lack of seriousness, and especially of respect on the part of the customer service.

### "Nice staff on board"
Flew Brussels Airlines from Brussels to Bordeaux. Arrived at the airport in time, good check-in and nice staff. Punctual trip. Nice staff on board. There is nothing more to say, it was a nice trip. The only thing was the price, as I booked late, the price was a bit above what I expected and I had time constraints.

### "poor service we received"
Billund to Vienna via Brussels. I am amazed at the poor service we received through our entire interaction with this airline. From delayed flights - we were stuck in the plane on the tarmac for 2hrs post our scheduled take off, all the cabin received during this time was one chocolate each and zero updates on take-off or our connecting flights. To lost (and ultimately damaged) luggage - we arrived in Vienna in sub zero temperatures with no luggage, and thus no heavy winter jackets. To extremely poor handling of our luggage claim, we were told that they were only responsible getting us point to point, the fact our jackets didn't arrive and we were forced to take a cab to our hotel wasn't their problem. Plus our damaged luggage claim has taken over 6 weeks for payment still not to be received for our damaged stroller. The only thing this airline seems to excel at is poor customer service and no empathy for the customer throughout the entire experience. Yes they cheap on some legs, but is isn't worth it if the slightest thing goes wrong. Do yourself a favour and find / fly the alternative.

### "would not recommend this airline"
Flew business class with Brussels Airlines and they forgot my checked in baggage in Brussels to my flight on the way to London. I had to wait for my baggage for 5 hours in London Heathrow airport because that was the best option to get my baggage back in time. I would not recommend this airline.

### "staff were not friendly"
Brussels to Kigali. The staff were not friendly and not attentive to the call button for the entire 6 hours flight. It was a meal serving flight but they did not have enough meal for all passengers. The bathroom was not cleaned periodically. Going forward, I will hope that Brussels Airlines will improve their service.

### "they seem to have taken a nosedive"
I have been using Brussels Airlines for some connections from Uganda to European cities (Brussels and London). The quality of flights is basic, but they are one of increasingly limited options. In my last flight (Entebbe to London via Brussels SN467/SN2093 on 13/12/2017) they seem to have taken a nosedive. The airline initially announced that the flight leaving Entebbe would make an unplanned stop at Kigali, before continuing to Brussels. Thus they allowed boarding of Kigali-bound passengers and asked all to ignore the seat allocation printed on their boarding passes. The boarding was delayed and disorganised. Once on the plane, someone worked out that the detour would have exceeded the maximum allowable work hours for the crew. The plan was changed back to the original direct flight to Brussels, but now they had to disembark the Kigali-bound passengers! This caused chaos: loud complaints by the passengers who had been promised transport to Kigali, refusals to disembark, ridiculous threats by some members of the crew that the flight would just take off for Brussels with any Kigali-bound passenger that did not disembark, overall not a very professional image for Brussels Airlines. Eventually all Kigali-bound passengers disembarked after promises of local hotel accommodation and a flight next morning. Then Brussels-bound passengers were asked to move to their initially allocated seats, multiple counts and baggage checks had to be done and eventually the flight took off 3 hours and 20 minutes later than scheduled. I managed to make the connection in Brussels (the London flight was also delayed over 1 hour) but my baggage did not, so in London I had to make a claim at the counter with a number of other unfortunate travellers from Entebbe. The customer service employee apologised for a computer malfunction that prevented proper tracking of my baggage, but promised that I would get the baggage later in the evening, asked for my address and gave me a phone number to call. He said to purchase any essential toiletries and retain receipts for reimbursement. I reached my destination, and in the evening I called the number, but the delivery company did not have any record of my baggage. The next morning, same thing. I purchased some toiletries. The baggage was finally delivered late at night on the second day. I thought I should at least claim reimbursement for the toiletries and went to the Brussels Airlines website, entered my flight details etc. and got an automated acknowledgement email in a few minutes, pre-emptively apologising for possible delays in getting back to me. In fact for 1 month (today is 11/01/2018) there has still not been any reply, despite multiple reminders sent to the customer service department. Maybe this review is a bit long, but I thought I should just let others know about this Brussels Airlines experience.

### "Bad communication"
Freetown to Brussels. Flight 9 January canceled after false start without further explanation - only technical problems. Flight on 10 January with a waiting time of 8 hours! Bad communication. No food or drinks at the airport in the waiting time. Luggage from baggage belt and check in again! No staff.

### "lost my luggage"
Accra to London via Brussels. If you do not want to lose your luggage never use Brussels Airlines. Check in and cabin staff excellent but customer service very, very bad. Brussels Airlines lost my luggage and refused to pay for compensation. They may lose your luggage. Never use again.

### "very chaotic and unorganized"
Flew Brussels to Hanover. Brussels Airline has very poor service and customer service. I would not recommend this airline to anyone. My flight was canceled, I was provided with the wrong informations and a refund was not paid although promised at the airport. The service at the airport was very chaotic and unorganized although this cancellation was very foreseeable. I would never travel with this airline again.

### "seats were comfortable"
Flew London Heathrow to Prague via Brussels with Brussels Airlines. I was searching for last minute flights and this one had a really good price, even though it wasn't a direct flight, but since it was from Heathrow it had a short comute so it was a good option. Aircraft came 20 minutes late, but boarding was quick, but unfortunately Heathrow is really overcrowded and needs another runway, so we arrived 30 minutes late to Brussels and only had 35 minutes for layover. The crew gave all passengers with short flight connections express passes for Brussels airport, which was really nice and not all arlines do that. Second flight left 10 minutes late because we waited for some passangers. Otherwise seats were comfortable and aircraft has nice interior. I would recommend this airline.

### "worst customer service ever"
Flight from Birmingham to Brussels was cancelled due weather condition. (I had connecting flight to Athens). This can happen, it doesn't depend on us and I understand that. People where waiting at the airport 5 hours just to find that out. After that no information provided at all! We where offered to take our luggages back and were told that airlines will contact us for further information, just nobody knows when. Then, 06.44 am I received an email with some information about my gate change (departure 06.15 am) Wait, what? I didn't receive any new ticket as promised. All stressed out I took my luggage and started my journey from another city to Birmingham airport again just to find out what's going on, because their customer service line was just off all this time! So after getting into the airport after 2 hours trip, everything what I received was a suggestion of flight next day (that means 2 days later than my booked flight supposed to be). So again 2 hours trip from the airport (I am not talking only about time, but expenses as well) and now waiting for tomorrow-  worst customer service ever, I will never ever use that airline again!

### "All four flights were delayed"
Billund to Mumbai return via Brussels. All four flights were delayed, ½ hour from Billund til Brussels, 1.5 hour delayed from Brussels to Billund. 1 hour delayed departure Brussels to Mumbai (also at arrival). We were supposed to arrive at midnight in MUMBAI I know the same plane returns scheduled at 0115, so a slot delay. The flight time is scheduled for 8:35 hours to Mumbai and 9:50 the other way? So they are probably calculating in to catch up a delay on their way back to Brussels (and have an advantage in leaving early from Mumbai). We departed 1 hour late from Mumbai and arrived 15 minutes before scheduled arrival. Being constantly delayed causes more extra time in airports since you cannot calculate in permanent delays and need to be in the airport in due time. Brussels - Billund flight were also delayed both times. The airline simply don't have enough aircraft or are over optimistic. Flights are ok, but they the entertainment system is thin - not much to chose from, very few international tv-series and movies. No remote - which causes a constant tapping in your seat from the person behind you playing a game! Food and beverage very good towards Mumbai but not back. Dry-dry chicken. No service on Brussel-Billund.

### "disappointed again and again"
Rome to Brussels. After this flight I found my baggage was lost, and the next day I will leave to Brussels for a long time. Finally they delivery the baggage to my friend's address after two days delayed, at the same time they refuse to gimme the compensation even if I have no towels, toothbrush when I arriving at China. Brussels Airlines's client support and grand handling service was terrible and make us disappointed again and again.

### "used valuable points for this bad experience"
We flew two very different aircraft during our travel from Washington to Madrid via Brussels. The first and last flight (out of four) were on an A330-200 which are configured for business and economy only. We traveled in business and hoped for a good experience as we used valuable star alliance points. The service was very good on our first flight to Brussels: flight attendants were wonderful and fun, food was ok, entertainment ok (but system is great) and it was easy on and easy off. The seat and cabin left much to be desired. The aircraft was uncomfortably hot, sweltering hot, and I just couldn't get comfortable enough to sleep well. The seat itself is awkward to say the least. I've traveled both business and first, trans-Atlantic and Pacific, in at least 9 other airlines, some frequently, and this seat was by far the most clumsy and uncomfortable. My husband and I are both tall and we found the way the seat reclines forces your feet into this very small compartment in which you then need to push yourself back up from to reposition yourself properly on the reclines seat. My husband’s feet could not move within this small compartment as they fit in like a glove and limited his ability to move around and settle. In most airlines you have two controls for you seat: one easily accessible when seated and one when lying down. Same here but during your repositioning neither becomes easy to reach and you have to hoist yourself up to reach again. There is no mid-range adjustment either. They have a recline position but if you don't like that one you have to choose between completely upright or full recline; no in-between or other adjustments! You can, however, just raise your leg rest. Little to no storage except in that little foot compartment I mentioned, which by the way goes away when you recline to flat bed. No place for your laptop, handbag or iPad when you sleep. I felt cramped. The food was ok. Wine and beer choices excellent. Entertainment choices were very weak but they did try and provide a good global sampling. The screen was very easy to use, sound good and no technical issues. On our trip back we had a less than pleasant server. I felt the simplest of requests (that I only have an appetizer and not dinner and receive my cheese course for a main) was met with a huff and near eye roll. I did notice our particular flight attendant complained to everyone working on board in ear shot of passengers about her job, conditions, other 'issues' on the plane. Fortunately not about passengers. Perhaps I just had ‘grumpy’ as my attendant. Again, this second flight was hot and uncomfortable. Several of the passengers complained and there was one flight attendant trying to communicate this to the pilot and we did receive some relief for a few hours. In general if you are traveling from the USA to Europe I think I would try and avoid Brussels Airlines. My husband who travels internationally most weeks, always business or first, said Brussels is his least favorite. I know it is hard to complain when we have the ability to fly in a premium cabin but we usually pay dearly for them. I am sad we used valuable points for this bad experience. On a positive note: Brussels airport is a dream. Lovely and easy to get around, not as overcrowded as Paris CDG or Frankfurt, and flights per our experience were on time and pleasant to board and go to connections. I’m sure that is in part because of Brussels. My hope is they better themselves

### "do not provide you any service"
I am a Star Alliance Gold member and picked Brussels Airlines for a connecting flight via Brussels Nürnberg believing in Star Alliance Quality level. Well, if you book Brussels Airlines you sometimes do not get Brussels Airlines. They have some flights being operated by BMI British Midland Regional which is a rather low budget carrier from the UK with small old planes. Bad service on the ground. At Brussels Airport for example they do not provide you any service. We came from overseas and had our bags we wanted to get rid of, Brussels Airlines refused to check them in and said it was BMI that we should talk to yet they only open 90 minutes previous to flight departure. I told them I bought a Brussels Airline ticket so why can not check in with them, they responded, no it is operated by BMI so go to them. I could not use Brussels Airlines machines neither the counter to check in. You book and pay for something you do not get, so why bother buying a ticket from that airline at all?

### "did what it said on the box"
Zagreb to Manchester via Brussels. On time arrivals and departures which seemed to service the Friday evening return home crowd. For this two segment flight we were not looking for anything special. There were proper announcements from the flight deck and opportunities to buy from their menu. In short, it did what it said on the box.

### "was the best flight"
Vienna to Brussels. That was the best flight in my life. Everything was super. I had economy plus so next to me was emply seat. I had very cute box with breakfast. The cabin crew was very friendly, airplane was very clean and nice.

### "Food could be better"
Brussels to Mumbai. Food in the Economy class could be better. After the Premium economy were served lunch, the non vegetarian option was no longer available. there was no choice of Indian or continental. Then the snack was over before the last five rows got it. No information given or even any attempt for the staff to make an alternative arrangement.

### "rude and unsympathetic"
Brussels to Malaga. The airline didn’t let me carry my hand luggage in the cabin because the plane was full. I politely explained that I needed to run after landing because I needed to catch a bus to my next destination and time was short, so checking the bag in was not an option. The staff was rude and unsympathetic and didn’t do anything to accommodate me. They threatened to leave me on the ground and forced me to check the bag in. As a result, I lost precious time waiting for my bag to appear in the carousel in Malaga (a very slow airport for baggage handling) and missed my bus. Absolutely unacceptable.

### "staff have an appalling attitude"
London to Berlin via Brussels. Brussels Airlines staff have an appalling attitude toward their customers! Staff seriously need to do the training for common courtesy. I have flown this route hundreds of times with other airlines and very seldom experienced such obvious contemp for passengers, or such apparent low-morale amongst Brussels Airlines staff. I am returning this same route with Brussels Airlines and frankly dreading such a lack of manners. I will most certainly not be flying Brussels Airlines again!

### "utter rubbish service"
Brussels to London. So for the second time in a day Brussels airlines mess it up, they change the flight to a gate miles away and only tell people 5 mins before, the mass panic that ensues and then, to cap it all it's 40 minutes delayed! No mention of this on the screens however, nothing! When you ask staff the question why don't you tell us in plenty of time they say they don't make the rules! I fly a lot with business and never felt I should leave a negative review - now twice in one day , both Brussels airlines. What utter rubbish service.

### "uncaring of our situation"
Moscow to Brussels. The plane was late, nearly an hour late, so it started badly. I was then in an unfortunate position, 3 children had been left with no adults on the row behind me, they kicked the backs of our seats as soon as we sat down and it did not stop until we landed 3 hours later. Now you may argue that it's not the airlines fault, but twice I asked for assistance. The first time I was completely ignored so I had to press the service button again once having wait ages. So second time round I asked if the attendant could find and have a word with either the parents, or the children. Well I'll see what I can do" was the response. Obviously he didn't care, I set on the edge of my seat the whole journey, almost crouched on the Brace position to get some relief. I tried again later when the attendant came past, he said one moment sir - I am now disembarked and wonder if I should still wait for them or just crack on with my journey. When I say it was hell it was hell, the staff were simply uncaring of our situation and I am dreading my onward journey with this same airline, never ever again will I choose this bunch of amateurs. Customer care means totally nothing to them.

### "Avoid if at all possible"
Traveled from Stockholm (SAS) to Lyon via Brussels. A party of four business travelers on separate tickets. In Brussels we were on the ground for nearly 2 hours. There is no excuse for our luggage to be left behind in Brussels. Baggage personnel in Lyon could not have cared less. Avoid Brussels Airlines if at all possible.

### "comfortable and quiet journey"
I flew from Edinburgh to Brussels on the new Sukhoi Superjet 100 operated for Brussels Airlines by Cityjet. The aircraft has a 2x3 seating configaration with plenty of leg room. The flight was full and left and arrived on time. Overall a comfortable and quiet journey. I did make any refreshment purchases. Crew good.

### "crew is very friendly"
Brussels to Athens. First at Brussels Airport there is a good member lounge, the lounge clean and bright and tidy, with delicious bread, tomato soup and all kinds of juice. And this member lounge is not far from the gate. Because of the reasons for the time difference, boarding, I directly put on the eye mask to rest. But when I woke up the crew asked me if I want to eat something, I had the pasta, toast, as well as desserts and chocolate. The crew is very friendly, it is a good trip, that is, the aircraft seat spacing is not large.

### "aircraft was comfortable"
New York JFK to Brussels. I took a long haul transatlantic flight with them and was not disappointed. The aircraft was comfortable: pillows, blankets, headsets provided and a personal IFE screen with a selection of movies, music, games and EuroNews to keep you occupied during flight. Hot meal was served shortly after a take off and another snack service right before landing. Flight attendants were very professional and never rude. Both flights were on time. The lavatory was clean.

### "is the worst airline"
Copenhagen to Marseille via Brussels. Brussels Airlines is the worst airline I have ever had a misfortune of flying with. My flight was delayed for over an hour on the tarmac and we received no information about what was happening. The flight was uncomfortable, with no entertainment or food/beverages offered. Upon arrival, myself and dozens of other passengers were informed our bags were lost. I filed a lost baggage report and tried to start my vacation without any of my possessions. It has now been 7 days filled with some of the most frustrating interactions of my life. The tracking website has been down for 4 days and there is no signs of anyone doing anything to fix it. As well, after a situation where thousands of people lost bags, the entire baggage help team took the weekend off and offered no information on how to get help tracing your bags. Today is day 7 of waiting. I have spent over 10 hours on the phone, I have sent dozens of emails, and still Brussels Airlines will do nothing to help other then to tell me to "be patient. If you are considering flying with this airline I urge you to to take any other form of transportation possible to get to your destination. If you fly with Brussels Airlines, you will be severely disappointed.

### "awful inflight entertainment"
Berlin to Mumbai via Brussels. Check in at Berlin for the flight to Brussels opened 30 mins after I had reached the airport and there was already a queue formed. Slow check in with one lady handling it all and then slowly built to 3 people checking us in. Asked for a paid upgrade to Premium for my flight from Brussels to Mumbai (as per the many emails they had sent me encouraging me to do so) but was told this can only be done in Brussels. (I had tried online- but even that's not allowed). Flight to Berlin okay. No food, no water. At BRU they forgot to send stairs - a 20 minute wait in the aircraft. Transfer at BRU chaotic and finally reached then gate - tried for upgrade again but was told the flight was full. Once boarded, we had a 35 minute delay as their connecting passengers from Manchester had not arrived.Flight to BOM was okay. Nice clean aircraft and enough room to sit. Food okay, nothing special. They serve alcohol only once. What is really awful is the inflight entertainment- there were very few options to watch. Staff were okay - friendly at times and quite surly at other times. As the airline has just introduced Mumbai to their flight map as their first destination in Asia, maybe a slightly better service would be called for.

### "increasing insult to passengers"
Budapest to Manchester via Brussels on the 9th Aug 2017. Manchester, arriving at the carousel we found all luggage piled/dumped, half on the floor, half on the carousel; which on enquiry, had broken down. My daughters case was amongst the pile. I proceeded to lost luggage where l was asked to fill out a form and told that the flight containing my luggage would be on a flight arriving at 5.30 that afternoon. The assistant asked if he could phone me when the luggage was in the office; I replied yes, of course! Needless to say l didn't get a call. It was now approx. 11am. I live in The Lake District. Due to pre-aranged business plans l had to be back home that same night, so I insisted that I would return to collect my bag. Before leaving l asked if anyone behind the counter could shed light on why so many pieces of luggage from all airlines goes "missing"? We've "no idea"! Could be many reasons, one of which is that customs can hold it back". So am I being told that customs can randomly withhold anybody's luggage at the risk of causing serious disruptions to that persons life? Nowhere does it say in the contractual agreement that your luggage may not arrive with you at your destination. Whatever the reason for this deplorable and escalating problem I was determined to find out. I tried to call Brussels airline via customer services. Via email. Via an online complaints procedure. I completed this twice but each time l tried to send the screen told me that an error had occurred. To be honest, what I really believe happens is that Brussels Airline at least, has made it impossible to contact them about anything other than spending money with them despite all the bumph on their website announcing how customer friendly they are and how you can complain and indeed even make a claim for compensation! The process of trying to have your voice heard is time consuming and excruciatingly frustrating. The airline achieves its goal and the customer gives up! Can anyone out there shed light on this increasing insult to passengers?

### "in the race to the bottom"
Berlin to Porto via Brussels. I really do miss Sabena. They had a fantastic product in business and economy. Brussels Airlines is a low cost airline that wants to be a classic airline. Their economy is really not different to Easyjet and Ryanair. Your ticket contains nothing, nada, zero. I feel they are in the large group of airlines in the race to the bottom.

### "shouldn't market better service"
Copenhagen to Venice return via Brussels. The inflight experience with Brussels Airlines was very good. The cabins looked new, and are comfortable with plenty of leg room. The food service was good, prices are reasonable and the staff friendly. But on the ground and in timeliness, the airline does not deliver. Four out of four flights were delayed, and on the outbound journey, our luggage arrived four days late. The b.famliy concept seems to be only a marketing stunt. The kids only received a small surprise on one of the four flights, and Brussels Airlines did not board families first in any of our four flight boarding experiences. So basically just the same as many other airlines - but they shouldn't market better service.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Geneva to Brussels. The flight was scheduled for 11:15, we took off at noon. Arriving at destination (Brussels), we do not find our luggage and or any person to tell us where to go. After having managed on our own, we learn that the luggage is still in Geneva and we should receive them soon. Total lack of information and organization. Very disappointing for such a large airline.

### "never recommend this airline"
Berlin to Florence via Brussels. Our 3 bags were lost due to a breakdown of the luggage handling equipment in the Brussels airport on June 15th. We arrived in Florence at 11:50 AM and filled out the forms to have them delivered. We had a set itinerary and had already booked our lodging throughout our week + in Italy. We were only 1 night in Florence and then we moved onto Siena. We waited and waited and no baggage, no text, no info. The baggage service at the Florence airport is only open for 1 hour in the morning and 1 hour in the afternoon so getting ahold of someone is extremely difficult. I managed to get the name of the courier company but no one there EVER answered the phone or respond to emails. On Sunday my Italian friend managed to get the couriers personal cell phone number and talk to him. He wasn't going to work that day since it was sunday  but she begged and pleaded and convinced him to return our bags to the Florence airport where we had to go back and get them before we departed for Venice, 4 hours later than planned. I purchased underwear and toothbrushes the first day or so. But after 2 days with no word from anyone I purchased some clothing and shoes. You really need to get better couriers in Italy as having our bags for Friday Saturday and Sunday and no word and then only through my luck at having local friends was I able to track down the courier and get him to return the bags. Other passengers would not have been able to get that to happen. After some difficulty I was able to file a claim for the expenses incurred while without out bags (underwear, a shirt and toothpaste) It has now been 3 weeks since the claim was filed and reference number was sent. There has been no communication from Brussels air despite repeated attempts on my part to see where we are in the reimbursement process. I have emailed repeatedly and tried to call only to discover you can’t actually call the customer service center. That to me doesn’t say “great customer service”. I have called the Brussels airlines number and spoken to various people in any department I could reach an actual live person. They have either promised to call me back and didn’t, or said they would have someone in customer service call me back which also didn’t happen. I would never recommend this airline to anyone.

### "return trip was a disaster"
Berlin to Brussels. The 17:00 flight to Brussels left after 20:30, the time our flight there was supposed to leave. Ours was then rescheduled for 21:45. No explanation was given to any passengers from either flight, though I saw multiple people try to ask. After a pleasing experience on the way to Berlin, the way the airline handled the return trip was a disaster.

### "very impressed"
Brussels-Toronto in business. First time on Brussels Airlines and very impressed. Seats are fairly comfortable (a bit too easy to accidentally hit the control pad though). Was traveling with my wife so window/aisle configuration was not an issue otherwise it would be awkward having to climb over the aisle passenger. Food was good and plenty of drink runs (including very good quality champagne). Overall cabin service was excellent. Only negative is limited choices on the entertainment system - good choice of music (easy to create a play list), limited number of new release movies, very poor choice of TV shows; ear phones provided are pretty basic compared to other airlines. Nice touch is the box of Belgian chocolates handed out at the end of the flight. Would definitely consider them again (although having to go through Brussels airport with its endless line ups is another matter).

### "I am still missing a bag"
Checked in at Edinburgh airport for flight to Mumbai, with overnight stop in Brussels. Checked 3 bags to Mumbai, 1 bag for overnight use to Brussels. Upon arrival in Brussels, last bag was missing. Reported the loss, and was not given any compensation, but when produced my Star Alliance Gold card for myself and my wife, we were given small 'overnight' bag which held a T shirt, and some basic accessories like toothbrush, paste, brush, etc. It has been 3 days and I have not received my bag yet, and my next flight out of Mumbai is tomorrow. The stewardess behave like they are doing you a favor. Press the call button and they walk past without stopping, or stop to shut the light without asking why we called. Seat does go flat but cranky, does not always work, and it is hard to get the setting just right. There are 3 fixed positions, upright, lie flat, and an intermediate position. Seat is quite narrow, and for anyone with wide shoulders, it is pretty uncomfortable. Food Mediocre at best. End of meal cheese selection not altogether bad. Give this 3 stars - overall I would rate this airline 2 stars at best. Not one area of the airline excels or stands out, except in a negative way. The only good thing was there was a buggy waiting outside the plane to transport passengers to the immigration counter, but it was 1 buggy, so you have to scramble to get on it, but I understand other airlines have a similar facility so it may be a Mumbai airport facility other than Brussels Airline service. At time of writing I am still missing a bag.

### "aircrafts clean with acceptable legroom"
Brussels-Barcelona return. Outbound flight left with a delay but arrived on time. Return flight delayed about 40 minutes but sales in the cabin for drinks and food were offered at lower prices because of the delay which was a nice geasture. Both aircrafts clean with acceptable legroom and fine cabin crew service (like most of the time). Brussels Airlines should change their hand luggage allowance, 12kg on European flights is just too much!

### "Hated the flight"
Brussels to Geneva. Paid a higher class ticket (Light&Relax) in order to have a window seat in front rows reserved. At boarding the staff informed me without any excuses that my seat got changed form 6a to 19B. They could have chosen discounted tickets to move seats instead of a more expensive ticket! I always pay a premium ticket to be in front, window or corridor. Hated the flight and not sure I ever would favour again SN over low-cost carriers in fact.

### "total lack of organization and service/support"
Brussels Airline canceled my May 2017 flight from Washington Dulles airport to Florence via Brussels due to weather conditions. We sat on the runway for nearly 3 hours. Other (larger) jets took off after the storm but Brussels Air claimed not enough jet fuel to make the trip after the storm passed. This is somewhat understandable, but the airline - at 11.00pm at night - had one scheduling/booking person to handle a line of 250+ passengers requiring re-booking. Worse - attempts to call the airline reservations/service desk by phone resulted with a "we are overwhelmed with calls. Call back tomorrow" message. To reach my destination only one day late (versus two to three), I had to accept a flight the next day out of NY Kennedy at 2am in the morning and I had to drive to NYC myself from Washington DC. At 7am. I was told the flights to Florence from Brussels to Florence were booked for the next two days unless I shifted to Lufthansa out of NYC traveling via through Frankfort. Working with the excellent Lufthansa was ultimately a great relief after the total lack of organization and service/support at Brussels Air. I am a very experienced traveler, and will never fly this airline again under any circumstance.

### "traumatic experience"
I am a frequent flyer. Unfortunately with my 3 month old baby, the flight I usually take Toulouse to Moscow was full so I took Brussel Airlines via Brussels. Crew were obviously more shop keepers than flight attendants and don't give a damn about their job of caring for their customers. Traumatic experience for me and my baby.

### "Terrible experience"
Brussels to Strasbourg. Terrible experience, on month after issuing the ticket they cancelled the flight and move me on the next day. I had to pay extra night hotel. On departure from BRU we had 45 minutes delay. On returning to BRU we had 1 hour and 20 minutes delay. What can I say for them, for such a short flight such hassle.

### "very impolite staff"
Brussels to Tel Aviv with very impolite staff. Paid USD 400 for a 4 hours return ticket, only to discover that no food and not even water was included. When I questioned the company's new policy and mentioned that this was not a low cost flight some staff from 'Supply' crew retorted this was in fact 'great for the company'. I was simply astounded. It is very debatable how great this is going to be in the long run. As soon as real low cost companies start the route let us all switch to those. We will see then how this absurd policies and ill treatment of paying customers will turn to be not so great for the company.

### "add some perks to compete"
Porto to Budapest via Brussels. Check-in at Porto was easy and fast. Their ground staff were friendly and helpful. There wasn't a long wait. My checked bags went through to Budapest. Brussels Airport was kind of small and lacked amenities, but the rail link to downtown is excellent. Was very disappointed that neither plane I flew had in-seat or shared entertainment. Considering that they're not as cheap as the real discount airlines, they should add some perks to compete. Second flight from Brussels to Budapest was delayed by over an hour, but that was made clear.

### "crew was very friendly"
Brussels to Warsaw return on new A319. Both flights were on time, and return one arrived even a bit earlier than scheduled. Check-in without any problems and offered several options (via mobile phone, online or in kiosk at the airport). Cabin crew was very friendly and some of its members spoke several languages. Due to new Recaro seats there was relatively much legroom. However, they would really improve their service if served even a small complimentary drink.

### "customer service is extremely poor"
❎ Unverified |  The airline's on ground reservations and customer service is extremely poor, in fact it's pathetic. You cant book your tickets online, website simply crashed and any attempt to email customer service left me with "message undeliverable the email address doesn't exist". I have had to call the reservations desk in U.S. for 3 days in a row and got no help. Third day and still no tickets. This is extremely disappointing, they kept increasing flight fares so the by the end of 3rd day they are asking me to pay more! I do not recommend this airline to anyone. You are better off spending your money on others like Emirates, Qatar, Air France etc. They do great customer service and online booking is a breeze.

### "leg room was sufficient"
London Heathrow to Brussels. Short flight of about 40 minutes from LHR to Brussels and that as well on a BAe146 for the first time. Despite the small size of the aircraft, I felt the leg room was sufficient. Staff were tentative and gave us small cup of orange juice/water. Shirt and sweet experience overall.

### "excellent leg space"
Edinburgh to Washington via Brussels. Economy Class with excellent leg space. Economy Privilege the same as Economy (I did not notice any additional leg space), a better dining experience than Economy, same entertainment as Economy, a hot towel handout (timing of handing out the towels is odd though), a glass of champagne with meal. I personally wouldn’t pay an additional EUR 100 just to get a better dining experience, a hot towel and a glass of champagne. Cabin service excellent, could not fault Cabin atmosphere: Again, could not fault in anyway. Value for money, what I paid was half that of British Airways. Brussels Airport is a lovely airport which is being upgraded. Very clean with all the amenities one needs including charging ports on pretty much every seat! A330-200 in excellent condition. I would not hesitate recommending Brussels Airlines. They would get a 10/10 only if Wifi was available onboard.

### "very poor communication"
Round trip from Rome to Brussels with Brussels Airlines. First flight had 1.5 hours delay with very poor communication. We knew about the actual leaving time only after having waited in the queue for more than one hour. Return flight was event worse: the airline communicated a delay but then started the boarding before the time initially expected! The ground assistance was very rigid. They didn't allow a small bag as cabin baggage saying the cabin was full and the bag was too big to fit below the seat. I have flown several times always putting that bag under seats and also with Brussel's flight I could do the same. At the end I had to check in the bag but there were several empty spaces in the cabin. Arriving in Fiumicino I lost a bus connection because I had to wait for my bag at the belt.

### "there was no service
Athens to Brussels. New A319 but with no drop down screens. Seats were untidy and over used. Seat pitch was ok. Crew were indifferent and there was no service. You had to buy everything, when you were asking to buy something the crew were smiling to you and they were friendly, otherwise were indifferent. Both flights were on time but embarkation and disembarkation were with buses (no air-bridges were used). If I had a choice I would avoid them.

### "could have served a small soft drink"
Brussels to Warsaw return on refurbished A319. Check-in was very quick and convenient and I was able to order for free a digital newspaper for my flight and relevant info on my mobile. Information at BRU very well provided - the screens were even showing an approximate time of reaching the gate. The crew on flight BRU-WAW seemed to be little absent - one passenger had a small problem with his seat selection and no flight attendant helped him. On the leg WAW-BRU it was better - the crew was very nice and smiling. The aircraft themselves are well equipped - new thin Recaro seats are very comfortable and provide enough leg room. On the other hand, they could have served even a small soft drink included in the price of ticket in economy class. At such price a complementary tea or coffee would be nice.

### "top service on board"
Geneva to Brussels in C class. Another great flight with Brussels Airlines. Top service on board and impeccable manners by the cabin crew. Despite the short flight time they provided full meals service and endless drinks. Very good public announcement. Departed and landed on time. Will be flying with the soon again.

### "The worst airline"
Brussels to Tel Aviv. The worst airline. Never fly this route with them. They use a tiny plane with miniscule lavatories for a 4 hour flight. The lavatories are so small. The service is terrible and extremely unfriendly. They do not even serve you water. This is for a €240 euro 1 way ticket that they for whatever call a low budget airline. I flew Ryanair and liked it. They are terrible. I also flew to Brussels to New York. While the plane and service were much better they lost my luggage and it took them 5 days to get it back. They kept on promising to bring it and kept me waiting and wasting my time and lying to me. I finally got it and some things were damaged.

### "excellent inflight service"
Flew Brussels Airlines, flight 551 from Brussels to Toronto on the 21st Feb 2017. Excellent inflight service. Cabin crew were helpful and friendly. Food was very good and following after another long flight the crew went out of their way to make me feel comfortable. Keep up the good work.

### "a very good experience"
Brussels to Toronto. Business class on Brussels Airlines A330 alternates rows seating 1-2-1 with rows seating 2-1-2. When seated at the window seat of one of the 2-1-2 rows, the passenger can only enter or exit his/her seat by "walking over" the fellow passenger: this is quite awkward, specially when not travelling with a partner. Fortunately our flight was only half full, so I could move to a single window seat. Apart from this, the plane is spotless, flat seat very comfortable, service punctual and very courteous, food excellent although somewhat limited choice. An added touch - perhaps not a permanent one - a gift of a nice Belgian chocolate box to each passenger. Overall, a very good experience.

### "very pleasant experience"
Brussels to Prague return. Both flights operated by A320 aircraft painted on the Red Devils livery which  is impressive. Check in services in Brussels a breeze with polite and helpful staff. Boarding the same. Onboard welcomed by a smiling crew. Since I was traveling on a Flex fare I was offered on board catering which was delicious. Information provided from the flight deck and also shown on the IFE screens. The crew was attentive, professional and well groomed. Flights on time. Baggage delivery swift and honored priority baggage delivery on both airports. Overall a very pleasant experience. Will be flying them again soon!

### "fly Brussels Airlines again"
Krakow to Brussels. I booked this flight with the purpose of flying the Avro RJ100 before it's phased out from Brussels Airlines' fleet. The boarding was fast and the departure from KRK occured earlier than it's been planned. The purser of the flight welcomed us and was friendly during the flight. The only complaint I have is about the quality of the catering products. The seats on this old aircraft were extremely comfortable with a large legroom. The flight time was less than 2 hours and the flight was basically uneventful. We arrived at BRU before STA. To sum up, the flight was pleasent and punctual and I had a good customer service experience. I'd fly Brussels Airlines again.

### "service as good as this"
Dakar to Copenhagen via Brussels. My son fainted at check in Dakar. We don’t speak French and the situation was very unpleasant. A staff member from Brussels Airline came to our help. He arranged that a nurse came and my son was taken to a medical clinic in the airport. Soon it was clear, that we could not fly that evening and my son had to go to a hospital. The staff arranged that baggage was delivered back to us and helped with hotel and transportation for 4 other members of our family. He followed me and my son to the hospital in the ambulance and told us to contact the office when my son was ready to fly. Next day my son was ready to fly, but the plane was fully booked – Brussels Airline office told us they would find a solution. 3 staff worked to rearrange passengers to ensure that we could sit together. We got 6 nice seats in the plane – better then the ones we bought. And the price for all this; “don’t worry about that, just have a nice flight”. I have never experienced a service as good as this! When you are in deep problems, you can be very happy to have Brussels Airlines Senegal at your side.

### "they swapped my ticket with no fees to assure I got home safely"
We we're meant to fly to Milan last night, flew in from Birmingham and we were changing in Brussels. When we got to Brussels I received some bad news so I could no longer fly to Milan. I had to get back to Birmingham asap and the last flight of the night was leaving in 15 mins and I hadn't even got a ticket. Brussels Airlines got me on that flight with no delays and were so kind and helpful about it! I am still amazed that they swapped my ticket with no fees to assure I got home safely.

### "flex and fast product is pointless"
Brussels to Manchester with Brussels Airlines. Horrible company to fly with. Their flex and fast product is pointless as you will have to queue like anybody else. The staff look a bit miserable and unhappy, it really feels like they aren't even trying to make an effort. I would rather fly Ryanair and save my money.

### "zero respect for passenger"
Manchester to Toronto via Brussels. Zero respect for the passenger. Lost both of our suitcases one for six days and the other until the day before our return. Spend 4 hours trying to record the loss of our luggage as 40 other people had not got theirs either. Cost me 50 CAD for the parking £75 in phone calls to try and trace the baggage as well as every morning wasted attempting to call either Toronto or Brussels to see if the baggage had been found only to be told two days before I returned that the baggage had not left Brussels. I have lost both of those cost as they do not have to pay incidentals even though the cost was incurred due to the fact that they had lost our luggage. The response from the airline is almost as if they are immune to all that may cost you due to their incompetence. Food was distinctly average even though the staff were very pleasant on board. there truly is nothing good about this outfit other than that.

### "most disorganized airlines"
One of the most disorganized airlines. On my flight to Geneva from Prague we were marooned on one plane in Brussels for two hours after being told that "there's some slight technical problem". Then we were moved to another plane, where we kept being marooned for the next 3 hours. As the result I was 6 hours late when finally arrived. On my return flight, another delay due to which I almost missed my connecting flight. What kind of a service is that? Steer clear from this company unless you always want to be late, hungry, thirsty and angry at your destination. I give this airline the lowest possible score. One other note: You have to pay for food and drinks aboard. The cabin crew is polite though.

### "Totally awful experience"
We flew out of Manchester to Nice via Brussels. On arrival in Nice our baggage had not arrived along with a dozen or so other people. Very unhelpful staff on the baggage counter. Brussels Airlines simply did not want to help or offer any aftercare. We were skiing and staying two hours from Nice up a mountain. We had to spend 3 days in the clothes we stood up in. Brussels Airlines offers no help and I had to phone the baggage helpline twice a day myself. After 3 days 4 of us were re-united with bags. They had actually arrived in Nice the day before apparently but nobody could be found to make the 2 hour journey to our accommodation . One of our party still doesn't have her bag. On return home they then lost one of the bags again. I am now trying to engage with Brussels Airlines to find the lost bags and make a complaint and seek compensation. Our holiday was ruined as we were unable to ski for 4 out of the 6 days we were there. It is impossible to actually speak to anyone and impossible to find an email address to send a complaint letter. This company really does not care about it's customers. It does not care about your luggage and has no coherent procedure for reuniting you with luggage should it go missing. Totally awful experience and I will never fly with them again.

### "crew seemed quite agitated and stressed"
Flew Manchester to Tel Aviv via Brussels return. The way there was okay besides that we got a small cold snack when we were expecting a warm supper on a four hour flight. On the way back the incoming flight was delayed and there was a further delay leaving Tel Aviv. The cabin crew seemed quite agitated and stressed. We once again only got a snack served. At least we had brought some food along because we doubted we would be served a proper meal. Might as well fly a low cost airline where I don't get a meal served. When I asked one of the stewardesses for a cup of hot water I was told to get it myself in the galley! Another stewardess could not be bothered to help a father who was trying to pick up some food his child had spilled. She just stood and watched. Due to delayed arrival in Brussel doubted I would get my connection to Manchester. Was told by the ground crew to run and you might make it! Why could they not get me there on a Buggy if the plane was specially waiting for me as they made me believe. Lies! Plane hardly waited for us as one of my fellow travellers on the Brussels to Manchester leg told me. Boarding had been delayed on that flight and passengers had just settled down when I came on the plane. The suitcases of course did not make the connection (be warned Brussels is notorious for this!) and arrived late the next afternoon almost 24hrs after we arrived and would you believe a new suitcase got damaged.

### "great experience"
I flew with Brussels Airlines on an earlier occasion, from BRU to BJM and back. This time around I went to Birmingham to spend some time with family, both flights were aboard an Avro RJ100 1st flight, OO-DWA and on the return OO-DWB; was quite rare to have exactly the same flight crew on both flights. Nice flight, skilled pilot who executed soft landings; he made some sharp turns returning to BRU during the climbing to 28.000ft a bit uncomfortable due to the g-force. You have the possibility to choose your own seat when checking in at the airport. Great experience. Had to book through BMI Regional, because it's cheaper to book through them for the same flight. That's a bit odd, BMI stated operated by SN Brussels Airlines, but booking through Brussels Airlines would've been a few hundred euro's more expensive.

### "the service offer wasn't great"
Travelled to Toronto for Christmas 2016. Brussels Airlines was chosen almost entirely on price, and from other reviews and word of mouth I did not have high expectations. The ground service was average, in-flight crew were better (quite friendly), but the service offer wasn't great. At the end of the day, our flights were on time, we were quite comfortable, and all our luggage made it there and back again; would fly them again for sure, but can't rank them up with the best. The only really bad thing that happened was at Bristol Airport when we heading off on holiday. Flight departure scheduled for 6.05am, so we got there at 3.30am expecting to be able to check in and then relax in the departure lounge, this was not to be. The check-in desks didn't even open until 5.10am, which meant that not only were we stranded in the check-in hall (lots of other passengers waiting too), but it was a mad rush from check-in, through Security, and to the departure gate! Not the relaxing start to our holiday we were hoping for, and other airline desks were open, so it's not standard for that airport.

### "old and worn aircraft"
Flew Brussels Airlines from Málaga to Brussels. I guess it cannot get worse than this in Europe: For an 800 Euro ticket I got: No priority boarding, old and worn aircraft, mediocre Economy style food with tons of allergens, plastic cutlery, lost luggage and multiple hour delays. Seat was average and the crew, at least on the outbound flight, was trying but it remains beyond my comprehension how this airline can be a member of Star Alliance.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Copenhagen to Brussels. I got to the airport, only to be told that me return business class ticket had been cancelled as it was a "duplicate". I was offered no assistance, no offer to rebook the cancelled ticket as it's fully flexible and was simply told that I could try at the third party ticket counter at CPH. I got there and was told there was nothing they could do. They pointed me to a pay phone, but then I ran out of DKR for making phone calls. I asked to use their phone and was told over the phone that I couldn't be helped and that my best bet was to buy a new ticket at the counter for flying, which I did. I was then told that my refund would be processed upon arrival at Brussels Airport. Upon arriving at Brussels airport, I was told that I couldn't be helped. I booked the same flights there and back. I found that they had cancelled my ticket because they wanted to sell all of the return flights seats as Economy. That's why my business class seat was cancelled. It took three months to get a refund of the ticket price. Lufthansa was gracious enough to refund me the booking fee, as Brussels Airlines refused to. It then took me until December to get the EU mandated compensation out of Brussels Airlines. Avoid at all costs.

### "would not use unless I had to"
The journey with Brussels Airlines started badly as the Brussels-Douala flight was overbooked and I was relegated to standby. After a very stressful wait at the gate I was the last passenger to get on. This is the first time this has ever happened to me and it was very unnerving. Once on the plane things were ok. Cabin service was efficient, if a little graceless. The return flight was ok, particularly as I had managed to get an upgrade to Premium Economy. I don't know if it's the same on other airlines but there were only 4 toilets in the economy cabin, and on the return leg one was out of order before the flight even took off. This caused long queues in the aisles which must have inconvenienced both the cabin crew and the passengers seated nearby. All in all things were ok but I would not use this airline unless I had to.

### "never fly Brussels Airlines again"
We had booked a flight between Manchester and Billund via Brussels. First, on the return leg, the 21:00 take-off from Brussels was delayed 15 min for some reason. Then one of the stewards had some kind of health problem. This is force majeure, but what happened next is not! It took them more than one hour to decide that the flight had to be cancelled altogether. Next, it took them 1.5 hours to give us new boarding passes for the following day and get us to various hotels in the vicinity. We were in our rooms 23:50. We were told to be ready in the reception 05:00 (way too early to get anything to eat) even though our new flight were scheduled for 07:26. Sure enough, we had to wait almost two hours in the airport. We were not offered breakfast or anything else for that matter. And on the flight home the cabin crew just pretended everything was fine - trying to sell us stuff. And answering rudely, when we enquired about the breakfast meal we were entitled to in accordance with EU regulations. It was obvious that their plans for handling such an event were weak, but what really bugs me is the fact that they were too cheap to acknowledge what was a massive inconvenience in a suitable way. And did I forget to mention that the new flight was delayed more than half an hour? I will never fly with Brussels Airlines again.

### "cold efficiency from the crew"
Brussels to Moscow. With Brussels Airlines, based on experience, I can only expect cold efficiency from the crew, ground or flight. FA service was standard. Food served for this more than 3-hour-flight should be reconsidered.

### "this redefines cattle class"
Flew from Brussels to Berlin. Never been so cramped in my life. I fly over 100 times per year with all kind of airlines but I have never felt as constrained and suffocated as I did with this Brussels Airlines flight. The seat is tiny, my legs were squashed up against the front seat. This redefines cattle class. I will make sure not to fly this airline (late on both stretches of the route) again.

### "negative is not available."
Had my flight delayed out of Oslo to Brussels, which made it very likely that I will miss my connection to Geneva. Tried to find someone to help at Oslo airport, but there was no one from Brussels Airlines and their alliance partner SAS (although serving other members of the alliance) did not have an agreement with Brussels Airlines. I then called their customer service desk in Belgium, but had no help. All they told me was to find help from the airport even if I told them many times that it did not exist. They told me I will, indeed, miss my connection but refused to suggest an alternative. They actually went as far as telling me that all flights the following morning were fully booked. This turned out to be an outright lie. They also refused to commit to any overnight accommodation. So I boarded their plane in Oslo knowing that I had no connecting flight but without knowing what to do in Brussels. Their transfer desk very easily found me a flight the following morning (note I had been told earlier that all were fully booked) and directed me to a hotel for the night. Finally I got to Geneva in the middle of the following day, as opposed to 22:00 in the evening. I contacted the airline after my arrival. Initially they denied any responsibility as my flight was less than 3 hours late (they only looked at the first leg to Brussels), and now after more than 2 months and numerous emails, they had "completed their investigations" concluding that my flight to Geneva was less than 3 hours delayed. Having spent the night in Brussels and arriving some 13 hours late, I found that a very interesting conclusion. Generously, they offered my €25 as a commercial gesture. I had to rate them as 1 out of 10, only because 0 or negative is not available.

### "overall a very good flight"
Brussels to Vienna. The Loft Lounge at Brussels airport was excellent with very good food choice. Flight impeccable, with very friendly cabin service in flex&fast with drinks served several times. Good legroom and overall a very good flight. Neuhaus chocolate after dinner snack!

### "one of the worst airline experiences"
Tel Aviv to New York via Brussels with Brussels Airlines. This was by far one of the worst airline experiences my husband and I have had. On our flight to the US from Tel Aviv via Brussels we did not receive our Kosher meals although we made sure to order them with our ticket. We were told on the flight that we had to have confirmed the Kosher meals when checking in, although no such confirmation option appeared when we checked in. It does not make sense that a passenger who ordered a special meal would suddenly not want it when checking in and that the airline can assume that they can remove that special meal. To make matters worse, we just checked in to our flight back to Tel Aviv that is scheduled for tomorrow. We had planned to add an extra bag each for the flight and pay for that ahead of time. No option was available in the check out process so we finished checking in and called the airline's customer service for assistance. Not only did the representative put us on hold for every question we had but she told us we would have to pay more to add the luggage since we had already checked in. Even though we had never encountered this before we agreed. However, when she wanted to charge us 100 Euro per bag on the phone instead of the 75 Euro listed on the website we declined. We are hoping to simply pay the 75 Euro tomorrow at the airport, although at this rate I am wary to believe anything that Brussels Airlines says. We will surely never fly Brussels Airlines ever again.

### "the worst airline ever"
This is the worst airline ever! Our flight from Toronto to St Petersburg Russia had a plane change in Brussels. Once on new plane the pilot announced we would be taking off momentarily since some of the luggage had been loaded? When we arrived at St Petersburg, 1 of our bags did not arrive. The reason we were in St Petersburg was to run in the White Nights marathon. Unfortunately, the bag that did not arrive contained all of the running clothing and shoes in addition to the clothing needed for the remainder of the week's vacation. After being given forms at the LED airport counter to fill out in Russian (which we don't speak) someone provided us with a form in English to complete and a tracking number. Every day we called this number and were told the luggage had not arrived. Six days later, on the last day of our stay we were told that the luggage had arrived and we could come and get it. We were leaving that night for the airport so we said we would just pick it up when we got there for our return flight home. Once we returned home, I submitted my claim for reimbursement. The claim included the minimal amount of clothes that I purchased to get through the week, since each day we expected that our luggage would arrive. Brussels Airlines has now declined our claim submission twice as it is their position that a power failure caused the delay and they have no control over this. I have wasted much time and energy to only receive a form letter back advising that they can not reimburse me for what I was forced to purchase. I will never fly on this airline again and can only hope that others don't find themselves in a similar situation with them!

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Edinburgh to Brussels with Brussel Airlines. Not a bad flight. We left about 15 minutes late, due to a delay with the incoming plane. The gate crew kept us up to date with accurate departure times. The plane seats 3 x 3 across. The seats are leather and very comfortable. Plenty of leg room. No electronic seat display. The flight is only about an hour and it was a very smooth flight. There are no free beverages, the flight crew was very businesslike. There was a delay on arrival because there was no one to get the sky bridge exit ramp attached to the plane. They were busy. Really! Luggage was speedy. Still, I don't have any major complaints.

### "clean aircraft, superb cabin"
Brussels - Barcelona return with Brussels Airlines. Both flights had a delay which was the only minor point. Online check-in and mobile boarding pass worked like a charm. Clean aircraft, superb cabin crew like most of the time. Food products are from the brand "Foodmaker" which is a huge improvement. Still like to fly with this airline, despite the delays they have most of the time.

### "how horrible they could be"
Toronto to Brussels. 4 years ago I flew with Brussels Airlines and had a horrible experience with customer service after me and my teams flights had to be rebooked due to flight delays. I vowed to never fly with them again, but It's been so long it seems I forgot just how horrible they could be - until my recent flight. Flight attendants rude and disrespectful for no reason. In addition they skipped over me for both meals and when asking them about it I was scolded for getting out of my seat. Please give your business elsewhere.

### "a flight with a terrible crew"
Paris to Douala via Brussels. I asked to change my return ticket. After 1h30 on the phone I was informed that it would cost 171€ for the change of ticket. I received another call 1h later informing me that the change would actually cost me 249€, I agreed on paying this amount, insisting with the person on the phone to confirm the cost would be 249€ IN TOTAL and not 249€ + 171€. She confirmed. I received later a bill of 130€ for the change of ticket + 290€ for the cost difference, which is equivalent to 249+171€, so 420€, that I would never have accepted to pay! Since then I have called the after sale service 4 times in 6 open days to ask them to listen to my conversation and correct their mistake. They told me each time that my request is being processed and that they will call me back in the afternoon, which never happened. With regards to the flight, I had a flight with a terrible crew that looked annoyed at each request and that was being very unskilful - my neighbor got wet with wine&water after the hostess tried to serve him drinks and I got water on my computer too and never got an apology.

### "never encountered a company like this "
Copenhagen to Brussels. I flew Brussels Airlines in July 2016, due to strike action our plane was more than 2 hours late and our luggage was left behind. I understand these things happen but what I don't understand is the lack of care shown by staff. We were a family travelling from the other side of the world we had nothing and we weren't even offered a tooth brush. No one would reply to our emails our phone calls etc until we wrote on social media (something I have never done before but we we desperate). Our luggage has been previously left behind by Air France but we were kept up to date every minute until our luggage was returned. We are entitled to compensation and we have this in writing. We provided all documents requested and they then asked for our bank details on 1 August 2016 which we provided and we have not heard from them since then. I have never encountered a company quite like this - no wonder their staff go on strike. I would think twice about flying this airline. Even after the delay leaving our luggage behind you are not even offered a complimentary glass of water!

### "just don’t quite cut it"
London to Toronto via Brussels. Flight to Brussels in economy on A320. One hour late departure because of aircraft late arrival. Not particularly friendly staff who seemed to just go through the motions. Arrived one hour late in Brussels and faced a one hour delay for luggage. All passengers on the flight were affected. It would have been a lot faster to have taken Eurostar. I had an issue getting a seat assignment when I purchased my ticket with both airlines (Air Canada and Brussels Airlines who code shared the return flight), telling me that the other was responsible for the seat assignment. Both Air Canada and Brussels Airlines told me that I would not be able to get a seat assignment except on the day at the airport which turned out to be baloney as I was able to choose my seat 24 hours before takeoff on the Brussels Airlines website. Highly amateurish behaviour on both airlines part and bad service for the cost. Brussels to Toronto in Business Class on A330. Brussels Zaventem is a mess of an airport since the terrorist tragedies. Huge lineups just to drive into it, more lineups as one has to go through a security station before one enters the Terminal building, again huge security lineups to go to the gates, lineups (mine was 35 minutes) to go through passport control and unbelievably more lining up before boarding aircraft to have one’s passport stickered. It took me nearly two hours without pause from the moment I arrived t the airport to get to board my flight. The flight ended up being pleasant enough however the configuration in Business class is not comfortable. Three rows (left, middle and right) of two seats together and one single seat alternating down the row. The single seat has lots of surface room on either side compared to the two seats together that are fitted in a space equal to the single seat. Luckily I had a single seat but witnessed the unhappiness of two fellows behind me trying to get comfortable in the limited space they found themselves in. I peeked into the economy section and counted my blessings when I saw the sea of sardines. The service was good and the food edible though not terribly original for a much touted Michelin starred chef that was supposed to have created the cuisine. If I was to redo the trip I would fly back to Toronto either through Amsterdam or Paris to avoid Zaventem and choose Air Canada or Lufthansa over Brussels Airlines who just don’t quite cut it in spite of being the only direct flight in and out of Toronto.

### "old legendary Sabena stupidity"
First leg was a night flight from Toronto to Brussels. A330 was in good state, decent seats and IES , however the crew quickly dissapeared after serving lunch with the exception of a middle aged hostess who helped with crying children over night. The short flight from Brussels to Milan was the most ridiculous experience in 30 yrs: they found a technical problem when approaching Milano and decided to fly back and land in Brussels to save some penny on maintenance costs! But at the cost of passenger's time. It's still the old legendary Sabena stupidity. They shall be desperate of money or close to bankrupcy. Never again.

### "certainly no value for money"
I flew the Brussels Vienna route several times recently and always travelled with a Flex&Fast ticket. Advantages of the Flex&Fast ticket is bookings can be changed which I may have to do as I fly for business purposes and duration of my trips is often uncertain. Price paid for Flex&Fast is always premium (high). Apart of the flexibility Flex&Fast also allows Fast Lane Access in Brussels and Vienna which is nice. Also travelling in Flex&Fast you have priority boarding but both in Brussels and Vienna it happened several times transport to the plane is by bus so the only benefit you get then is you get on the bus first. A meal is included as well but having flown this route frequently the meal (a salad in a plastic box) always has been about the most horrible food I ever got served on an airline. I see several other passengers just like me open the box, take one bite and they are finished then. As a compensation usually the crews are enthusiastic and joyful. Flights are more or less on time though I already had a couple of delays of almost one hour in Brussels due to so called heavy traffic. Given the price paid certainly no value for money.

### "still no response for our claim"
Budapest to New York via Brussels. There was a ground staff strike during our trip in Brussels Zaventem Airport, so we had to sit 3 hours on the plane before take off waiting for the luggage load. After 3 hours the staff told us that they only loaded the cargo and all the passengers luggage were left behind in Brussels. We got no information in New York JFK what we should do, only a paper with a token for baggage tracking (what didn't work properly). After 50 hours we got back our luggage. But, this happened in June, still no response for our claim. Nothing. And they aren't reachable on phone or mail. The onboard service is ok (not superb just ok), but that's all.

### "Brussels Airlines didn't seem interested"
London to Zagreb via Brussels. I was only carrying hand luggage, as I prefer to pack light. Brussels Airlines staff made me check in my bag into the hold as the plane was 'exceptionally busy', despite being very early for my flight. My bag did not reach Zagreb the same time I did, and had to be delivered on another flight. This pretty much ruined the first part of my holiday. They had to deliver it the next day to my holiday accommodation, but we had booked an expensive day trip, which was also ruined as we had to wear dirty clothes, which were not suitable for the Croatian weather, was wearing glasses (couldn't see anything due to the glare). I understand mistakes happen, but Brussels Airlines didn't seem interested and refused to consider compensation for the inconvenience caused.

### "We were truly disappointed"
Venice to Madrid via Brussels. Had a terrible experience wasting whole day due to the sudden delay from Venice to Brussels for doing the transit to Madrid both with Brussels Airlines. We supposed to traveling around in Madrid! The service and communication were not well done by the company. The delay was not our fault but we were forced to change flight as the original plane was departed without us. We ran here and there in the airport and finally been arranged to board Iberia one hour later while leaving our luggage behind. The staff told us that the luggage will either reach on time with my arrival or I have to do a claiming. Above all was still fine until we had been told our luggage (which had all the important stuff, we had no single clothings with us) will only be sent to us next day afternoon! The 'next day afternoon' was still an uncertainty, we have to waste another half day tomorrow to wait for the luggage in the hotel, this was absolutely unacceptable, never had this kind of flight experience in our life! Brussels Airlines staff should have warn us so we can make better option and at least apologise! No compensation was done on this occasion. We were truly disappointed and upset!

### "not show any care for its passengers"
Hamburg to Brussels. Without any previous notice Brussels Airlines changed the Avro jet by a noisy Dash 8 with props operated by low cost carrier flybe. Even with the inconveniences of that change not all passengers were granted a free drink and when you eventually did want a drink you only were available to pay by credit card. Flight with some 35 minutes delay - once again Brussels did not show any care for its passengers.

### "need to offer a better product"
Last-minute booking from return London to Aberdeen produced a fare of nearly £300, but Easyjet and Flybe did not fly Saturday or had similar prices. Like budget airlines, I paid extra (£8) to reserve seat when booking. On the return flight a young family had the two seats next to me, and one over the aisle. I had paid extra for that window seat. They asked if I would take the aisle seat so they could sit together, which I did, but there is something wrong when I paid extra for that seat. I hate these extra charges precisely for these reasons, they cause more problems than they solve. It was better this family sat together ,but I was ripped off for that extra (small amount though it was). The crew on both flights were excellent, friendly and efficient, serving drinks (including alcohol) and a biscuit or crisps, the "included" offerings would cost around £5 on the "low cost" alternatives. If BA want to stand out from that crowd (And it should) they need to offer a better product than this..

### "with and without service"
Brussels Airlines still does try to be regular carrier and cheap carrier in the same cabin so : business called BIZ, economy with and without service (the last with and without luggage ) the economy without service is called "light" and passengers have to pay for drinks - even for mineral water - and some snacks the meals in the economy with service "flex" are disgusting and drinks are served out of big bottles. In business plastic cutlery however on the flight to Hamburg a lot of passengers from a connecting flight were seated in the "light" area and it appeared those pax are eligible for free drinks. So the following situation did happen your neighbour did receive free drinks and you had to pay 3€ for mineral water. 50 minutes waiting time when first piece of luggage came out

### "low cost with a bad customer service"
3 Hours delay in Brussels due to a thunderstorm, very bad communication. We had to wait in the airplane for almost 3 hours and we received one glass of water. When you fly in economy like we did, you have to pay for everything and the drinks and meals were very expensive. The crew was not friendly. The flight from Malaga to Brussels was a flight without luggage because there was a strike in Brussels. We couldn't check in our luggage so we decided not to fly. We rebooked the flight for free but we had to pay for an extra night in Malaga. I made a complaint and I am still waiting for an answer but they have a very poor customer service. Brussels Airlines is a low cost company with a bad customer service and they have most of the time delays. I would not recommend this airline.

### "extremely expensive for a basic service"
If you travel with Brussels Airlines on a route where there is little/no competition they are extremely expensive for a basic service. My most recent experience from Bristol-Brussels return (the flights are provided by BMI Regional) cost the usual several hundred pounds for the cheapest ticket and for that I got no flexibility, no hold luggage and very basic catering (a drink and biscuit). The outward flight was delayed by 45 minutes with little explanation and the return by three hours due to a ground crew strike at Brussels. I am sure the airline will claim this was beyond their control, though some flights appeared to be leaving on time. They did nothing to ease matters, and only very reluctantly issued drinks vouchers, to those that asked, after two hours - they are a legal right. Premium prices, below average service.

### "service on board is fairly basic"
Took four flights with Brussels Airlines over the course of a long weekend from Birmingham to Nice via Brussels. Check in at Birmingham took about 25 mins which felt a long time because there were only 10 or so people in the queue and most of them had checked in online. The online check-in process allows you to select seats which is obviously better than a free for all when you get on the plane. My bags were automatically routed through Brussels though which was good. The service on board is fairly basic, but my flights were only 1 hour or so long so it didn't bother me. I did buy a coffee on the first flight which was 3 euros and was more than adequate. The leather seats were very comfortable with plenty of leg room. The punctuality of the flights was the only negative, although it didn't directly affect me. All four flights were between 15 to 45 minutes late leaving, which meant that for some people connections at Brussels were a lot tighter than they should have been. The cabin crew did call out the gate numbers for selected flights when we were taxiing to the terminal at Brussels but I do wonder whether the bags would have made for those passengers with tight connections. Overall, I would recommend this airline, but be wary if you have less than 1 hour connecting in Brussels because in all likelihood it will be less than that in reality.

### "a bland experience"
Porto to Brussels with Brussels Airlines. First and lasting impression was that Brussels Airlines is akin to a low-cost carrier. Only 2 flight attendants were present, one warm and the other grossly uninterested - both disappeared 40 mins into the flight. No entertainment, only buy on board food which had 1 vegetarian option - a brie sandwich. Flight was uneventful. Quite a bland experience.

### "is good value for money"
Budapest to Malaga via Brussels with Brussels Airlines. The plane was delayed half an hour. Despate the delay I could reach my connection. My baggage arrived. The flight attendants were smiling. There wasn't a food choice - only one sandwich or one warm food so I couldn't choose what I wanted. There was a lot of food in the magazin but available only from July or they didn't have it. The route wasn't shown on the monitor, I missed it. The seats are not comfortable but good for a short flight. The ticket was cheap -  if you want a cheap flight and don't want a low cost airlines in this case it is good value for money. But you should consider delays.

### "my luggage did not make it"
I flew from Toronto to Billund (Denmark) via Brussels and my luggage did not make it on to my flight, Hence I'm without most of my shoes, trousers and all of my shorts. It's not because there was very short time for my luggage to be transferred from one plane to the other. In fact they had over two hours. In comparison my initial outgoing flight with Lufthansa was delayed by an hour, which meant there was about 15 minutes for both me and my luggage to make it on to the connecting flight in Frankfurt. But even within that timeframe my luggage made it. It needs mentioning that I was not the only one who didn't get my luggage. I counted at least 15 people who had to contact airport staff at Billund Airport. 15 might not seem to be that many, but it's too many. And since this was a Dash 8 with many unoccupied seats, I'm guessing it could be as much as 50% of passengers who left the airport without most of their belongings. The flight from Brussels was the first of three scheduled flights to Billund. All with Brussels airlines. Another flew Saturday arriving 11.20 (June 11th). However, my luggage has still not even made it Billund Airport (who I contacted 16.19 on June 11th). Even if my luggage makes it to Billund Sunday (June 12th) it might take a day before I get it and then I'll be traveling to 28 degree Rome without shorts. On another note my seat (Seat 37K Flight No. SN552) was terrible. The headrest is so big that when the seat is an upright position you're simply unable straighten your neck. The headrest couldn't be liftet up as it would then fall down again. I do have a few positive things to say about Brussels Airlines. In-flight food and service was great, the airline does provide tickets at a low cost, the online check-in is simple and changing/choosing seat was easy to manage.

### "do not serve complimentary water"
Vilnius to Prague via Brussels in mid-May 2016. Boarding was quick and efficient at Vilnius, cabin crew were polite and helpful on the A319 used on this route. Much to be desired from the seats which did not provide the best comfort. Arrived in Brussels with on time. The cabin crew on the connecting flight to Prague were warm and friendly, but due to delayed departure from Brussels the arrival into Prague was pushed back by 20 minutes. Seats on the Avro RJ7 used on this flight were more comfortable than their A319. Bags arrived on the belt within 10 minutes of disembarking aircraft. I was a bit surprised that they do not even serve complimentary water or non-alcoholic drinks to all passengers in Economy class. I understand that these days airlines are trying to cut costs to achieve a bigger profit margins, but even juice or a nice hot cup of tea on Brussels Airlines would be welcome sign that they're not Ryanair or EasyJet.

### "random seats all around the plane"
In past I had some non-pleasant flying experience with Brussels Airlines, but these two flights (Lisbon-Brussels and Brussels-Oslo) were outstanding. There were three of us, on two different booking numbers. We managed to choose adjacent seats via online check-in, but a woman at the bag drop in Lisbon provided us with printed boarding passes with random seats all around the plane. We naturally complained and the woman behaved in an unprofessional manner, literally shouting at us and claiming that the airline is in process of changing internal system, so she could not do anything (she said that it was not possible to change our seats from the ones assigned by the system). She also refused to call responsible person to solve this situation claiming that there is nobody who can solve this. Eventually we had to fly on non-adjacent seats, but it was still possible to scan old (mobile) boarding passes (with somebody else seats) on the security check

### "Overall it was good"
Brussels to Agadir, and first time to fly with Brussels Airlines, was a little concerned as to other reviews I had read. Yes, they are of a low cost model, but they were fine. Crew were pleasant and efficient, there were 2 separate snack/bar services during the flight which is better than most airlines who only come around once. The selection of soft drinks and sodas were limited as was the sandwich selection, while the flight is technically an "all economy" service they have an enhanced service called Bizz+Class which I was sorry I didn't avail of. Overall it was good, just its a pity on flights that are 4 hours plus that there is no wifi, as it gets very boring.

### "seriously underperformed"
Flew Brussels Airlines from MAN to GVA via BRU. Caught an early flight because I needed to be in Geneva by midday - so much for that. Boarded as usual, only to be told after boarding finished that we would be delayed (held on the ground) for an hour due to fog in Brussels. This stretched out to 2 hours (with minimal communication from the crew). Crew didn't really seem to care about passengers missing connections and said they were being "generous" by offering a "free glass of water". On any other airline that'd be offered without even making a point about it. No food or water otherwise offered during our 3.5 hour stay on the aircraft. Missed the connection to GVA by miles, despite our flight being held for ages every other flight left with minimal delay. Had to feel sympathy for people flying to America who'd missed the only flight for the day. Rebooked on to a later flight, eventually arriving in GVA 3hrs after I was scheduled to. Likewise on the GVA sector no complimentary food or drink offered. Brussels Airlines really might as well call itself a low cost carrier, it sure acts like one. Compared to other Star carriers I flew this trip (Star, Swiss) where they came around with multiple drink services and food, Brussels Airlines seriously underperformed. Given some of the prices they'd charge, I'd expect better service than easyJet. SN certainly didn't deliver.

### "choose another airline"
We travelled home from Brussels to Manchester, and quite the most awful airport/airline experience we have ever had. Our flight was rescheduled over 3 hours earlier with less than 48 hours notice and due to the airport only being accessible to cars and taxis we had to pay an exorbitant taxi fare (more than the cost of our flight!). Unable to rebook on a later flight as Brussels Air agents` phones continuously engaged throughout. Utterly excessive security at the airport, we had our boarding cards and/or passports checked 6 times en route to the plane, and had to queue in the rain just to get into the terminal. No signage as to the revised parking/access arrangements outside the terminal so the taxi went round in circles clocking up more tariff! We have every sympathy with the lovely Belgian people over the recent tragic events but Brussels Airlines and the airport authorities appear to have ditched all concept of customer care in the aftermath and are leaving travellers with no choice but to like it or lump the bills. Best to avoid Brussels Airport completely until it`s all back to normal, whenever that will be, and choose another airline when it is.

### "without doubt our last experience"
Edinburgh to Lyon via Brussels, our first experience with Brussels Airlines and without doubt our last. I booked with this airline to ensure we had a maximum amount of time in Lyon, generally I would prefer a direct flight but arrival at 11am meant we could make the most of our time in the city. Delayed by 45 minutes on the outward flight, there was no attempt to allow people attempting to make connections priority exit from the plane. The airport is vast and because we were flying from a non-Schengen country to a Schengen, we had to travel between the A and B areas, and had to negotiate Security again, the only concession to our connecting Brussels Airlines flight was an 'express' pass which made no difference whatsoever. Boarding had been closed for a matter of moments when we arrived at the gate, we and a number of other delayed passengers were refused boarding. I know the constraints placed on airlines and pilots but the airline knew we were all booked on that plane and had been delayed due to their own airline's delay. We were then shuffled off to an enormous queue at the service desk, a poorly organised and somewhat shambolic affair. Eventually when we reached the front of the queue we were told they'd re-routed us via Munich, adding yet more time to our journey. We were delayed again on the return flight, I fully accept that there are matters outwith the carrier's control but there was no communication at the gate, very frustrating, particularly after the poor experience of the outward journey.

### "catering is probably the best part"
Return flight Brussels to Kinshasa in business class. Seat arrangement is 1-2-1, then 2-1-2, and so on. All seats have direct aisle access except for the window seats paired to an aisle seat. Cabin crew very good, and catering is probably the best part with a good choice of sdishes, nice wines, and plenty of tasty Belgian beers to choose from. The aircraft was clean when boarding, so were the lavs through the flight. The seat, although converting into a flat bed, is not really comfortable, and can only be moved as whole between different positions (take-off/lounge/sleep), so not possible to move the back or the footrest independently from other parts. Okay for flights up to 7-8h, but not longer. Expectations for the IFE were high were spotting the large touchscreens and taking the classy remote in hand, but movies, tv shows and music available are very limited, and somewhat dated. Moving map however is excellent; but better bring your own music with you, or movies on a tablet.

### "looks like low cost"
Unhappy, about flights from Brussels to Gran Canaria return. One front toilet available, so continuous row of people next to business class passengers. On line check not working for Gran Canaria to Brussels sector. No lounge access since the company did not make an agreement for a Gran Canaria lounge. Service mimimal and in a hurry. For a 4.5 hours flight, one would expect a pre-dinner/lunch drink. Quick warming of lunch on LPA BRU flight, drinks came later. Lufthansa much better service on the Munich to Gran Canaria flight. Brussels Airlines looks like low cost.

### "aircrafts clean"
Outbound Brussels Airlines flight from Brussels to Rome FCO left with a delay of about 20 minutes but landed exactly on time. Return flight had a delay of about 1h30 due to medical on board and lightning strike on the right wing. Because of this delay, staff offered drinks for free and handed out chocolates which was a nice gesture. Crew on both flights very friendly as usual. Aircrafts clean on both legs as usual.

### "sometimes with a nice smile"
Brussels to Rome with Brussels Airlines, cabin crew was not interested in service, no smiles, not rude but you could see, they didn't like their job. Return flight with a very nice cabin crew, smiles and good service. The opposite of the flight from Brussels to Rome. Brussels Airlines brings you for a cheap fare to somewhere in Europe, sometimes with a very nice smile included.

### "on-board service poor"
Seasonal flight from Napoli NAP to London LHR via Brussels BRU. Brussels Airlines failed to manage summer holiday crowd. Flight from NAP to LHR was delayed for 40 minutes. I barely made it for second leg to London, but my suitcase was left behind by the airline and delivered to my house exactly 24 hrs after. On-board service poor, seats very thin and hard. I wouldn't take Brussels Airlines if it's not part of Star Alliance. At Brussels Airport there is no priority boarding for Gold passengers. Quite disappointing.

### "such a bad experience"
Washington to Yaounde via Brussels and this has been such a bad experience with Brussels Airlines. Customer service is so bad. I don't yet know when I will be issued a new ticket when my flight got cancelled due to a storm three days ago. They keep telling me to call United Airlines which is not helping at all but by law Brussels is the ticket holder and should be the one to try to find me a flight. Brussels Airlines is useless if there is a problem with your flight especially when they bundle it with another airline.

### "don't enjoy their work"
I flew Brussels Airlines from Hamburg to Manchester via Brussels. Well what a dissapointment. The ground and cabin staff who represent Brussels Airlines in the air and on the ground have attitude and act like they don't enjoy their work. The food selection that you have to buy is very limited. The planes themselves are nice and clean. I had a connection time off just 1 hour and trust me, if they try to sell you a connection ticket for under 1 hour you won't make it, I have long legs and am young and only just made mine - you have to clear security again and are not entitled to a fast lane. Overall would rather fly an airline such as Easyjet where staff are great and they have a extensive buy on board program.

### "never will fly again"
Birmingham to Budapest via Brussels. Despite asking when booking and when checking in if there was enough time to change planes at Brussels, I was sold a flight to Budapest with 50 minutes to get between the two flights which is clearly not enough time because you have to go through all security again. It was an early evening flight so it wasn't even busy but there was just not enough time to get through all of the security checks. Brussels Airlines deliberately book you on flights through Brussels when they know that many people will not be able to make the connection. On the day I travelled there were approximately 60 people checking into a hotel for overnight stay because they had not been able to make their connections. This is only one hotel, I believe that they use multiple so the true number was obviously more than this. I have never flown with Brussels Airlines before and never will again, but I heard people saying that the happened all the time with Brussels Airlines. I raised a complaint with Brussels Airlines in October but am still waiting for a response three months later, having sent reminders three times.

### "does not care about customers"
Copenhagen to Geneva via Brussels with Brussels Airlines. I have never travelled with such an incompetent airline. Everything went wrong from the moment I had paid my tickets. In spite of writing on their web page that change to an earlier airline on the same day, they charged me. They had given me seats up front at the booking time, but at flying time I was given other seats further down. Flying back I was called in earlier because of bad weather in Geneva, and they managed to lose my luggage, which turned two days later. I started writing customer service about the initial things in October 15 and I have not heard anything yet. Brussels Airlines does not care about their customers.

### "food and drinks very high quality"
Flew Brussels Airlines from Brussels to New York JFK. We had a perfect flight. After take off, an appetiser was served. We took a Gin and Tonic. Afterwards we were served a very good dinner. Further during the flight we were served an ice cream and right before landing we got a mini pizza. All food and drinks were of a very high quality. The crew were very kind, we talked with them for a while and had a pleasant conversation. We even received some good tips for New York. The inflight entertainment system is modern and responsive, however the choice of movies is rather limited. That was the only downside.

### "is this a low-cost carrier? "
Flight was not a good experience at all. Is this airline a low-cost carrier? Brussels Airlines charged me 35 euro to check in one bag even though I am Star Alliance Gold. Ground staff were very grumpy and chatted amongst themselves - lacked customer service skills. Plane was new but had no IFE and service was non existent. Ordered a glass of water and they tried to charge me 3 euros?! This is not a good airline at all and should not be apart of the Star Alliance!

### "crew and their attitude"
Entebbe to Marseille via Brussels. Nov 2015 I flew from Uganda to France with Brussels Airlines. I was in a bad shape having been hit by a very bout of malaria 2 days before and still suffering from it. I felt tired, in pain, in short very lousy but I had to travel. In Entebbe, I told the crew about it and asked them if I could buy a business class seat with my frequent flyer points. They said they were sorry as it was not possible after boarding. However, as soon as we took off and the seat belt sign went off, a flight attendant appeared and told me they had set aside a row of 4 seats in the back for me to able to lie down and sleep. I thanked them many times as it made the trip so much more bearable and promised myself I would post a positive review. Yes, believe or not, Brussels Airlines can be swell! That is if the right crew is onboard, of course! As a side story, on the way back there was a call for a doc as a passenger had had some sort of seizure. I am a doc (yes even docs can fall sick!) so I got up to attend to the passenger in question. There, I surprisingly met a colleague of mine who also volunteered to help. We were both a little surprised that the Brussels emergency kit lack drugs as elementary as Valium pills which were indicated in this case (they only had injections), and when we were done, all we had was a cursory 'thank you' from one of the attendants! We didn't expect the moon but still, it just shows you it's all about the crew and their attitude.

### "headrests extremely uncomfortable"
This was an overnight Brussels Airlines flight from Entebbe to Brussels, which because of the peculiar headrests extremely uncomfortable. The only way I could get any sleep was to pull down the tray table and put my head in my arms on it. The staff were as helpful as they could be and specifically asked me to draw attention to this problem - as I am not alone and hopefully another complaint will help to bring some action from the airline.

### "cabin baggage problems"
Brussels Airlines from Brussels to Lisbon. This time not just delayed, also unfriendly and not professional. Even the bus driver from the gate to the aircraft had an urge to show his unfriendliness. Boarding by bus to the airplane from Schengen to Non-Schengen part of the terminal is a total mess, bussing from the gate in a cramped bus, waiting in the bus, than later on in the rain to get to the staircases which lead to the airbridge, waiting inside the airbridge since the aircraft has not been ready (cleaned) yet, then in the aircraft to get a slot since we missed the original one. Cabin crew not helpful, especially when it comes to cabin baggage problems. And this happens especially since they introduced the new fare concept. The baggage was on the belt 55 minutes after landing.

### "not what we expected"
We went to Vienna last year with Brussels Airlines to celebrate new years evening in the magnific city of Vienna. Because of the snow and cold weather the engines were frozen and they need to de-froze them. So, we had a delay of +2hrs. Actually, we had to sit down for 2h in the airplane. The staff was not that friendly and there were noisy babies aboard. The flight was not what we expected, because we arrived late in Vienna. The plane comfort was okay. I had good flights in the past with Brussels Airlines, but this was really not okay.

### "a low cost airline"
Is Brussels Airlines a low cost airline? Booked a flight from Brussels to Davao (Philippines) and back with Singapore Airlines. First leg was Brussels to Frankfurt, one hour flight on an A320 (Lufthansa), with snacks and drinks served for free. Frankfurt -Singapore with an A380 (Singapore Airlines), of course as much foods and drinks you want for free. Singapore to Cebu with a Boeing 737 (Silkair), three hour flight with warm meals and drinks for free. Fourth leg: Cebu - Davao (B 737 Silkair), 45 minute flight with snacks and drinks for free. Return flights, once again foods and drinks for free. Then Milan to Brussels on Brussels Airlines A319, one hour flight and to my surprise I had to pay for drinks or snacks. When we fly low cost airlines like Ryanair or Easyjet we know we have to pay extra for drinks and/or foods. But if I pay 1000€ for a world flight I expect to have drinks included. I will surely do my very best to avoid flying Brussels Airlines again. Expensive flights and no service.

### "Till this day I got no answer"
The Brussels Airlines Business lounge at Brussels is terrible! Friendly staff in the airplane. Seats are not very comfortable. Food is moderate. I forgot my reading glasses in the plane. The same day I reported this to the service desk with the exact place were I forgot this. Till this day I got no answer.

### "terrible experience"
I was traveling with Brussels Airlines from Venice to London, with a quick stopover in Brussels. My first flight from Venice to Brussels was delayed. A flight attendant onboard told me I would make my connecting no problem. Nonetheless, I still ran to my gate after security took forever and I still missed my connecting flight from Brussels to London because of the first delay. I then had to go to their customer service desk to find a new flight I could go on. The desk only had 1 person working there with at least 3 or 4 people waiting. After about 30 min or so, one more person came. The line was reaching to at least 10 people with each person taking around 15 to 45 min. I waited in their line for about an hour. Then they sent me on a British Airways flight 5 hours later. I asked twice if they are sure my luggage would be in London when I arrive, they replied "absolutely". I eventually got to London (after another delay from British Airways) and they did not have my luggage there. It got delivered the next day with one my zippers broken. A terrible experience with this airline.

### "low cost subcontractor HiFly"
The big issue was the fact that Brussel Airlines had to provide a low cost subcontractor (HiFly) for the flight SN205/206 Brussels to Dakar operated on the 16th August with 2 hours 10 minutes delay. We paid to fly with Brussels Airlines and not with an other airline (Hifly) which does not meet the kind of services I was expecting during the flight. No vouchers provided to us in order to get a snack during the delay time.

### "bags never made the transfer"
Tel Aviv to Washington Dulles via Brussels, Once on the aircraft, I liked the entertainment, food was okay, and crew was very pleasant. On the bad side, their customer service, or lack of it, was a major problem. Given their limited phone hours I was never able to connect with a person to obtain a seat assignment. This, in spite of a week of calling at long distance rates. Horrible. Additionally, on my flight over, my bags never made the transfer. Although not the fault of the airline (my flight from Dulles was delayed, so there wasn't enough time to handle the transfer), the company handling baggage was horrible. After registering with them, you are given a receipt and told to check their website for the status of your baggage. No phone number to call. Additionally, while standing in line to talk with someone, I noticed that they have a window for First Class passengers. When I saw that they bothered to have a special window for them, I knew I was in trouble. I wish to ad that while my luggage appeared the next day, my friend's baggage did not arrive for days. Finally, the company is in the process of eliminating regular check in at Tel Aviv. They expect you to use a Kiosk. I "assume" that will mean no staff, which is funny since during my check-in they could not issue boarding passes for 15 minutes due to a systems glitch. Standing there I had to wonder what people are expected to do if faced with a non working kiosk. In conclusion, prior to booking with them, I would try calling them to determine if they are now reachable should you require help, and ask if they will have staff at your airport should you encounter any problems. And finally, I would bring along a carry-on with everything you need to get by for a few days, should your baggage disappear.

### "overall it was good"
I flew with Brussels Airlines to Angola via Belgium and overall it was good. Although the flight attendants mainly spoke French with only a few being able to speak English (which surprised me because Angolans speak Portuguese and not one of the attendants could speak Portuguese) which meant that I had to translate a lot of things for other passengers who only spoke Portuguese. The food was good considering its airplane food and the flight attendants were generous with the drinks. The inflight entertainment was one of the best I've come across in a very long time with a wide range of movies and TV shows. The plane did get cold during our night flight but the attendants gave us blankets when we asked which was nice. Very comfortable seats which reclined well and enough leg room for me (5ft 6).

### "just ignore their customers"
In general, flying with Brussels Airlines is ok. However, if you have a problem, that's where you run into trouble. The airline has no customer service contact number - you have to call reservations and get them to handle issues (lost baggage, cancelled flights etc.) The phone centre staff are poor, they quite simply don't know what they should do. If you send an email - you'll be waiting 3 or 4 months for a reply. Generally, they don't want to deal with problems, they just ignore their customers.

### "service decent"
Flew with Brussels Airlines from Prague to Manchester and found them to be accommodating and friendly. Overall, the flight was on time and service decent. Would consider again if doing a short haul in Europe.

### "excellent service each time"
Fourth time we have flown with Brussels Airlines from Bristol to Brussels return this year, visiting our son in Belgium. We have received excellent service each time with the plane departing on time. Even though the flight is only one hour, we are given a free soft or hot drink and a snack. A special mention to one of the cabin staff on our last flight out and back, she was friendly and efficient.

### "waiting 2 years for response"
In December 2013 I flew London to Brusssels with my thirteen year old son, using two different booking references since he was subsequently returning to London and I was not. Our plane was at first delayed and then we were allowed to board. We sat in the plane for almost two hours without the taking off. During this time we were not allowed to use the lavatories or being served anything to drink or eat before finally being told that everybody had to disembark due to technical problems with the plane, and that everybody would be put on various different other planes to get us to Brussels. Given that the plane was full I queried that we would all fit in on that day's remaining flights since this was already quite late in the evening due to the long wait. I was told not to worry. Some people were then given changed boarding passes and were told to transfer to another aircraft. We did not get any new boarding passes and we came to the aircraft there were no more places on it. We were told that we had to go to a hotel in London for the night. My teenage son who had his own booking reference was told the same. Nobody seemed to query that it might not be suitable for thirteen year old to spend the night alone in a hotel in London and whether he would be capable of finding his own way back to the airport the day after. I insisted that we had to be on the last plane leaving for Brussels since I was injured and on crutches and had difficulty moving about and since we had to be in Brussels that evening. Finally they took somebody else's boarding pass and gave them to us instead, not even changing the names on the passes. This meant that some other people would have been forced off the flight. This procedure is totally against all rules since everybody should be given a chance to elect to stay behind against compensation, and the airline staff should not randomly select who gets to board and who does not. When my son was about to return to London after the holidays, his booking had disappeared and when I called the customer service I was told that his return flight had been automatically deleted since he never boarded the flight from London to Brussels and the system then deleted the return flight. When I informed them he had in fact boarded that flight but that the flight never left due to technical problems and we had to be put another flight they at first did not believe me. Finally they reluctantly and without any type of servicemindedness grumpily agreed to reinstate him on the return flight against a rebooking fee. When I queried this fee they finally gave in and waived the rebooking fee. After this a filed a complaint with their customer service and got an automatic message saying that I would be informed of the result after two week. This was almost two years ago and I am still waiting for any type of response from Brussels Airlines.

### "a journey from hell"
Traveled from Freetown to UK recently with Brussels Airlines. Customer care and service I received in Freetown was excellent. The staff were friendly and check in was quick and trouble free. On this flight there is a 40 minute hop to Monrovia where boarded passengers have to wait an hour before continuing on to Brussels. After an hour stop over we continued to Brussels and the crew began the evening meal service. It was clear they wanted to sling their meagre fodder and get passengers  settled down so they could do whatever cabin crew do. On previous flights they usually offer you a drink from the bar and offer another while you have your meal. I had one glass of wine and about a quarter of a pint of water. At 5 hours after boarding, I tried in vain to catch a stewardess as she rushed up and down the aisle to get another drink and was eventually informed that if I wanted one, I had to go to the back of the aircraft. So I asked for a drink from the bar and some water but had unfortunately interrupted one of the crew eating her meal. Whilst waiting for my drink I chatted briefly with a colleague who been similarly instructed to seek out water and the stewardess, tucking into her business class food platter, ordered us to be quiet as crew were sleeping! I mean we were about 2 hours out of Monrovia and the crew were already asleep? It must be a very tough job serving one drink from the trolley! The onboard entertainment was very poor and as usual with this airline I couldn't wait to get off at Brussels despite Brussels airport being the most miserable transit in Europe. The transit from Gate B at 5 in the morning directs you to bunch of G4s staff having breakfast who order you to ignore the signs and continue further on. 4 hours in this dirty and soulless place where the staff are ordered not to talk to you, look you in the eye or smile. Then came boarding for Heathrow. The flight had a large number of West Africans in transit to the UK and both airport and airline appear to have a policy to treat these passengers with disdain. They announced boarding about an hour before the flight so we queued and waited half an hour while the boarding staff chatted. Another half an hour to check travel documents and boarding passes but somebody had forgotten to open the doors to the ramp so passenger just backed up and waited resulting in an hour late departure. On my outward journey I noticed that they herd all Africa bound passenger to T Gate where there there is a glass divide with some facilities but no shops, eateries or duty free shops for waiting passengers. In a conversation with an African colleague he commented that Africans are poorly treated at Brussels airport and I have heard this many times over. On the final leg we were lucky enough to have one passenger who chose to scream out biblical passages and sing hymns at the top of her voice. The cabin crew could have politely asked her to respect her fellow passengers but they just ignored it. A journey from hell with the unfriendliest airline and airport. I would like to say "never again" but options to Freetown remain limited. I am looking forward to the commencement of another carrier in Nov 15.

### "more nightmares occurred"
The flight was nice enough with kind staff, but more nightmares occurred. Firstly we were promised a bassinet for our 5month old baby-we spoke to several people who promised we would get the bassinet - but when it came to it we did not get one. On neither flight to Brussels and back to JFK. The flight arrived in due time but not our luggage. We waited for 2 long hours for our luggage. The basement was hot and stuffy, our baby was cranky and tired we were all jetllagged but we had to wait for our luggage 2 hours. Our car service driver charged us a hefty sum for all this extra waiting time as well. When our luggage finally did arrive, not all of it was there. We were busy looking for a box we took a long and couldn't find it. Nobody was there to help us, we tried talking to people but to no avail. Nobody knew how to help us and how to handle the situation. So we left without the last piece of luggage. We called the airport to file a missing item, but no one was willing to help. It took us several days and several trips to the airport to track the missing luggage. We spent the first week of our vacation tracking luggage. We weren't helped by any airport or phone staff, and were left spending loads of money on car services back and forth from the airport to find the missing luggage. Finally when we did track the luggage the airline didn't want to pay for the delivery. It certainly wasn't a great way to spend vacation. We have spoken to many people since from Brussels Airlines that weren't a great help at all.

### "clean aircraft, nice crew, spacious seats"
On short haul flights (BCN to BRU) Brussels Airlines offers cheap tickets as from 69 euro, but that means you'll get a no frills flight. So no snack or drinks and so on. But however there is a difference between Brussels Airlines and a low cost carrier: clean aircraft, nice crew, spacious seats. Definitely good value for money on your trips trough Europe.

### "my first and my last trip with Brussels Airlines"
Copenhagen to Brussels with Brussels Airlines. The flight attendant who greeted us when we boarded the aircraft hardly smiled. Seating comfort average. Once airborne, the purser served the 4 (four) passengers in business and economy plus and was not seen again. Two flight attendants served the remaining passengers. They stopped at row 4, served coffee to a couple, then rushed 10 rows further down to the rear and never came back. We sat in row 5 and were never asked if we wanted to buy something to eat or drink. The female flight attendant later on rushed to the front of the airplane where she started chatting with the purser. Nobody was interested in the passengers. Before landing, we received a connecting flight information via the PA. It went like "information on your connecting flights is available on the screens inside the terminal. Very helpful! When we left the aircraft, the purser tried hard not to look at us and pretended that she was busy with something. Of course none of the passengers received a "Goodbye". This was my first trip with Brussels Airlines and it is going to be my last. I now understand why the predecessor of Brussels Airlines, Sabena, went bankrupt.

### "Staff very professional and dedicated"
A daytime flight on Brussels Airlines from Brussels to Ouagadougou. Business class Lounge (The Loft) in Brussels was very nice lounge with quite good selection of Belgium beers. Onboard, the business class seats are the same layout as Swiss or Austrian, best seat are 1A and 1K or any throne single seat. Seat transforms to lie flat bed. The menu had 4 choices as main courses (Fish, meat, vegan and pasta). Wine selection was French wine. Good selection of Belgium beer. The food was tasty and served quite quickly. Entertainment is big screen 16 inch, movies selection is quite limited, should be improved. Staff were very professional and dedicated. Very nice flight, and they offer you a gift before landing (box of chocolate), very well appreciated.

### "real difference can be the crew"
Quite average flights on Brussels Airlines, from Venice to Porto via Brussels return. From the price-quality relationship Brussels Airlines is an airline with very basic service compare to the price of the product in the European market (transfer flights via Brussels). The real difference in that scenario can be the crew. On the first segment VCE-BRU the crew members were exceptional. Great job from the cockpit and from the cabin crew members, especially the purser. 10/10 for this segment. All the rest unfortunately just okay, or in the case of the last segment BRU-VCE not even that, cabin crew on this segment not really interested in passengers at all. Totally disorganized check-in, both in Venice and in Porto, in Porto also unfriendly.

### "aircraft are old and worn"
Have been shuttling back and forth between BRU and BCN with Brussels Airlines for a while now, a route that is well served in BRU. Brussels Airlines advertised 69EUR fares that were mostly inexistent on the website. The aircraft are old and worn. My ironing board is probably more comfortable than the seat that is offered. Crew were distant and cold and my bag was offloaded at the door and had to be collected on the baggage belt in the airport. To be honest, my experiences on Ryanair on the same route have been more pleasant. We go the extra smile" in my case just meant: We take some extra money (for the same or lower service).

### "they lost my luggage"
The Brussels Airlines flight was okay, but they lost one of my luggage and still never resolved this to date. I was the one always chasing them for an update, and there's no phone number for customer service and the email address they provide works, but took over 3 weeks for a reply. It's now over 3 months since my luggage was lost I still haven't heard anything conclusive and was told 4 weeks ago that they were still investigating. On my way back home, one of my luggage did not make it on the plane and was left in London. Now am just hoping they will find it and give it back in a good state. Last year when I travelled with Brussels Airlines, one of my luggage arrived 2 days after me - I thought it was just a single incident but with what happened this year I don't think I'll be using Brussels Airlines again.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Once again, on the long haul from Europe to the USA, a great flight. The aircraft very clean and comfortable. The real strong point was the cabin staff. Friendly, alert, and attentive. No request was too much for them. Outstanding cuisine, and a great choice for all passengers. Spotlight on local Belgian beers. I really felt welcomed, and would not hesitate to recommend to friends and colleagues.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
The flight was fine, if not a little bare on amenities. The seats were incredibly uncomfortable. The shape of the seat was almost concave when sitting upright which forced you to hunch over. There was also a bar that I could feel through the seat right at my shoulder blade.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Had to change my travel plans so booked the flight 48 hours in advance. Only the most expensive of 3 economy class ticket categories was available. There was still a supplementary charge for paying by credit card. The ticket provided fast track security although there was no fast track available at the time I was in the terminal building. I was also allowed priority boarding. As we were bussed to the aircraft I was able to board the bus first. The full fare section of the cabin had no more personal space than the rest. I had an aisle seat with a rather large gentleman wedged in the middle seat encroaching on my own space. The seat itself was not vey comfortable, a bit like leaning on a leather covered ironing board. I counted 10 unoccupied seats in the section of the cabin allocated to the cheaper tickets. My luggage was one of the last on the carousel 40 minutes after getting off the aircraft.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Almost always flying longhauls for business, it had been a time ago that I flew short distance, and with my own national airline. Brussels Airline are very cheap, also when booking only a few days before flying, and the online booking/check-in tool is vey clear and easy to use. Flew 2 BRU-BCN return trips within 30 days, on weekdays and weekends, very early, mid-day, and late evenings. Flights were always on time, friendly service, food/beverages receiced orcoaid for in line with booking class, good seats, tidy airplanes. Exactly what I need and expect for 1.5hr flights. Felt a happy traveller.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Brussels Airlines, please don't sell ticket connections that require you to jog through the airport to make. 45 minutes between landing and the next flight departure time is not sufficient to wait to get off the plane, be loaded on to a bus, do a circuit of the airport, jog between terminals, go through Passport control, jog some more, then go through security and finally attempt to find our next gate. We were the last people on the plane through no fault of our own, and to make matters worse our luggage didn't even make the plane. So we were without luggage for the first 3 days of our holiday. I am a frequent traveller for work, and have been for many years and this is the most stressed I have ever been whilst travelling. The return flight process was almost as bad yesterday, but at least this time our luggage made it.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
We booked a trip from Cincinnati to Nairobi, Kenya. Everything went well except on August 7th our flight from Brussels to Washington was delayed for 4 hours due to technical problems. We missed our connecting flight to Cincinnati. We were then able to fly to Columbus, Ohio but from there rented a car to get to Cincinnati. The Brussels Airlines ticket agent in DC told us that if we submit the rental car receipt we would reimbursed as quickly as possible. It has been over three weeks and there is no response to our multiple emails to Brussels Airlines customer relations.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
All flights on time, excellent food and service on the Brussels - Kigali and return leg (London to Brussels OK, but too short for the airline to differentiate itself). Business Class seats are in a staggered configuration and go fully flat, though the legroom is a bit restrictive and limits the range of sleeping positions. One criticism (of Brussels airport rather than the airline) is the limited number of flight information screens and airport maps. Given that this is an airport which clearly relies on a lot of transit passengers, I was surprised at how difficult and time consuming it was to find out where to access my connecting flight and how to get there. I'd imagine that inexperienced travellers could have problems, especially for a tight connection.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
CPH-BRU-IAD. The cabin crew was attentive to economy passengers, and food was great. Since we were close to the emergency exits, we had a bit more room to stretch our legs. However, we wished the seat pitch could have been a bit more generous, and the headrests did not angle downwards. Aside from that, Inflight entertainment was great as my partner was able to catch up on movies and I was able to relax and listen to a selection of their music. We enjoyed our flight with Brussels Airlines.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
LHR-PRG via BRU. Old A319. Both flights delayed by over an hour due to operational reasons. Cabin crew were rude when I asked for a free water, they said "no. Cabin temperature was too hot, one man sitting 2 seats in front of me suffered overheating, and cabin crew rushed to get him water and an ice pack. This airline is of poor quality considering they are a Star Alliance member. Never again.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
The flight attendants were polite and spoke English well. Although the plane was quite old, the seats are quite comfortable. Me and other passengers travelling in Premium economy (Flex&Fast) received a Business class breakfast.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Excellent airline. Plane departed on time, staff was very friendly, legroom was good (I'm 1.93m, so for me that's important). 2 friends of mine had too large hand luggage. Instead of paying for it (like with a budget airliner), they offered to make it check-in luggage, without paying for it, since the plane was not full. Great service.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-IAD return. Online check-in worked good. Brussels Airlines A330 seats are clean and comfortable. Cabin crew professional and helpful. The food was delicious. Inflight entertainment is up to date. Unfortunately no wifi available.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
No check-in at the airport so you are forced to check in online. I don't have a printer. I had to run around a day before departure doing a job that used to be the airlines job. Online check-in should be an option, not a must. Boarding was late and there was no information as to when we would board. Left Tel Aviv late due to "traffic". In order to make my connection in Brussels, all I received was a "Fast Connection voucher. It still meant that I had to navigate my way through Brussels Airport, run for miles, cut in line at the hand-luggage check-in and made my flight. I do not understand why they have to check hand luggage again if you change terminals. The rudeness of the staff was incredible. When I received the wrong food and asked to exchange it, the flight attendant acted insulted, just motioned to me to hand her the food. An apology would have been nice. Also, when I needed extra explanation of what exactly I was supposed to do to make my connection, she acted annoyed. My luggage didn't make it and arrived in Berlin two days later, shortly before I was leaving the city again.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Fleet of A319 and A320 in this route. Fast check in and fast track, what fast track! Took longer that other pax! Good lounge and well services and staffed one. Boarding ok, flight itself lacks the extra mile, they have no time nor the wish to make your money worth it. Same shame on the return. Bags first out which was a surprise.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Flying on one ticket with my wife, but our seats were 10 rows apart. No way to fix it with ground staff at Tel Aviv airport.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Avoid Brussels Airlines at all costs if you are connecting through Brussels. Even though one of the runways is shut down for long term maintenance, the airline has not changed their schedule of flights. The end result is a guaranteed landing delay or sitting on the tarmac at the origin until a runway can open up. I missed two connections in three days because of this!

### Brussels Airlines customer review
I have flown Brussels Airlines many times and generally been happy with the service. However I will never use this airline again, because quite frankly they are a rip off. I booked a complete package online, not knowing baggage was not included. Contact Brussels Airlines today to find out that I had to pay 35 euro per bag, thats a total of 140 euro, if I had booked direct with Brussels Airlines the charge would be 60 euro. How can Brussels Airlines justify more than double the price for the baggage. Brussels Airlines on baggage are a total rip off unless your book direct with them. I know they will do nothing about it as Customer Service and Brussels Airlines don't go together.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Check in was fast. I was able to check in 2x 23kg cases, plus 1 x 12kg cabin bag and a personal bag for computer and other stuffs. The flight attendants were polite. The seat was comfortable (seat 7A).

### Brussels Airlines customer review
We were 2 pax traveling Oslo to Luanda via Brussels. We did have some negative vibes after having read some reviews but the connection was good and price attractive. Turned out to be a wrong choice. It started out with an overbooked flight from Oslo and an advice that one of us would have to stay behind. Only after reminding the ground crew that Luanda is an not an easy destination to reach, that we had confirmed tickets and that we hold Star Alliance did we get on board. The flight from Brussels to Luanda was just not good. The cabin looks and feels fresh and clean, food is acceptable but there end the positive comments. The seats are nothing but horrible. In theory they may be ok but that's only on paper. You feel cramped with little legroom and the backrest has a hard area that sticks out and makes it difficult to lean properly back. The recline is ok but as long as you have someone behind you, reclining is not an option. The fact that my traytable was very loose of course did not help. In my 40 years of intercontinental travel, I've experienced worse seats but that was a long time ago.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Early morning flight out from Manchester to Brussels delayed and we missed connecting flight to Gotenburg. Had to spend 7 hours in Brussels losing a day of planned activity. Return flight on Sunday evening cancelled as we would again miss connecting flights. Switched to Lufthansa with 3 hour delay. 15 Euros to spend in Brussels airport. Regular air traveller but will not use or recommend.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
I flew outbound with Ryanair and this was the return leg which I assumed would be far superior. SN has a superior hardware product and better facilities. However the crew let the trip down. Efficient but not friendly. The purser seemed to spend a lot if time scanning passengers and was even individually telling people off for not obeying the seatbelt sign long after the turbulence had passed. With crew it is luck and maybe they were having a bad day but for me this one experience has affected my image of the carrier.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Flew out Baltic Air impressed by website, online food reservation, professional staff and smooth transition. Return via Brussels awful. Had booked online food because of timing but none materialised. Transition through Brussels dire-dropped at terminal A for terminal B departure signage ran out around the baggage hall-eventually found my way to departure terminal to find flight delayed, no info on how long and few seats available to wait. Cafe closed at 18.00!

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Second time in two weeks I have missed connecting flights due to "late incoming aircraft" both resulted in 4 hour trips becoming over 8hrs. This is bad - but even worse is the customer service: summary below. 1: no info given on arrival, had to find way to service desk through the disgraceful Brussels Zaventum airport (building work all over) 2. Given a €15 meal voucher which doesn't even buy a beef burger meal, drink and a coffee. I should have been in Marseille at 4.15 and will now arrive at 20.30. 3. Refused lounge access (I travel twice a month with Brussels Airlines) These are £300+ flights!

### Brussels Airlines customer review
If you like the service level of low-cost airlines like Ryanair but don't mind paying a multiple of their prices Brussels Airlines is right for you. I'm a regular traveler between Berlin and Brussels. The fare is usually around EUR 450 when booked 2-3 weeks in advance. You might think that this entitles you at least to a free cup of coffee but not at Brussels Airlines. No inflight entertainment. They call this 'service' concept 'branded fares' and probably paid consultants millions for this brilliant idea but for me it's Easyjet on this route from now on.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-NAP return. Online check-in worked very well this time, so a big plus! Very clean and comfortable Airbus A319 aircraft on both ways. Cabin crew extremely professional, friendly and helpful. Both flights delayed due to atc restrictions (out) and one runway closed in Brussels (return). Recommended!

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Living near Brussels often obliged me to book Brussels Airlines (BA) for short flights. Although being a FF, nothing really distinguished me from the once-a-year tourist flyer. BA often changes my (chosen and paid for choice) seat. Its frequent delays ("due to late arrival" - I add "of the BA flight") are nerve-racking as they
never inform you - even if they have my smartphone number. It uses subcontractors in other airports who simply don't know what they stand for (when I have for instance a golf bag, it takes an extra 15 min for check in to verify why I don't have to pay). It never serves a drink or snack in economy (or what is equivalent to it). And
when you have to pay for it, often your choice is not available. No onboard newspaper (standard with normal commercial airlines economy). Excellent in sending excuses and offering (worthless) compensation. Many incidents on its booking sites (so that you can start all over again at higher prices). Too costly for very low value. Avoid
it if you can. I decided never to rely on it anymore preferring connecting flights than direct flights with this kind of company.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Flight from Florence to Brussels total chaos. Half the passengers were not allowed to board as according to the captain they did not have enough fuel and needed to reduce weight. All luggage was offloaded and so none arrived in Brussels. Still waiting as there is only one flight a day. When SABENA was alive most things went wrong but no one understood why. With SN they tell you why but it still goes wrong.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
SN2318 GOT-BRU on 18/05/15. Checked in 20 hours before departure and only 4 seats left! Boarding planned at 5.40pm which is the time the plane was supposed to land from his previous flight (SN2317 BRU-GOT). So of course boarding started late. Passengers were then asked to board fast with the result of being stuck for long minutes in the boarding tunnel. Enjoyable! Plane was fully booked with many noisy babies on the knees of their parents. Some trash of previous passenger were left at my seat. Inflight magazines were dirty with ripped pages. Service in economy started after 35 to 40 minutes (on a 1h30 flight!) with no other reason than a bad organisation. Only one sort of sandwich left when it was my turn. I had to decline even if I was starving. No excuse from staff. Nice smooth landing I have to say. On short-haul flights Brussels Airlines is more and more a low-cost airline with low-cost service at expensive prices. The return flight BRU-GOT-BRU without checked luggage (check and go) booked more than two months before departure cost me 225 EUR (far from the loss-leader price of 69 EUR)! As member of the same group they should see how things work with Lufthansa or Swiss!

### Brussels Airlines customer review
27/5/15 - SN3722 MAD - BRU then SN2177 BRU - MAN. First problem was poor organisation at the airport 1.5 hours until connecting flights and final destination Brussels passengers were separated. This could have been done immediately and would have reduced the delay to passengers. Problem two we were lied to by the assistants at the help desk after 2.5 hours waiting. We were told that no flights left Madrid for the UK in the afternoon then when we complained we were offered Newcastle as our only option rather than Manchester then the passengers next to us were offered a flight to Manchester so we complained again and after 3 hours were offered a flight to Manchester. We arrived 5 hours after our original flights. While the issue was not the fault of the airline the poor organisation and lying of the Brussels Airlines was the fault of Brussels Airlines. Totally unacceptable.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
FCO-BRU in Economy A319 aircraft early morning. Departed on-time landed on-time that's all. Low-cost carrier at its best no free water provided no IFE no smiles and lots of attitude from cabin-crew (except for one member) awful seats old aircraft. It is fine for short flights less than 2 hrs time I guess long-haul flights on A330 are different but will try to avoid it in the future.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
SN 465 20th April EBB-BRU and SN 465 BRU-EBB 25th April. It beats my understanding why those head rests were added on the seats. A head rest is supposed to give comfort not torture. One needs a pile of pillows to support the back otherwise one has to sit hunched like a monkey. Fares to Brussels are much higher than some airlines but I decided to fly SN thinking it might be a better choice. The moment I boarded and sat down I regretted my decision because I realized I could not sit straight neither could I recline on my back. I inquired from a flight attendant if this "slab" could be removed but he said it was not possible. I had to resign to my fate and endured the torture for more than 16 hours (to/fro).

### Brussels Airlines customer review
IAD-BRU-LYS in economy. Brussels Airlines was the low-cost provider and I cannot say anything super negative about them. Flights were on time food was decent and AVOD was more than adequate. FA's were not overly friendly but were helpful enough. Perhaps my cost-conscious flying experiences recently have lowered my expectations a bit too far but I thought Brussels Airlines was fine. Would definitely recommend and use again.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Vienna to Brussels - in the same cabin this airline does operate business economy with service and economy without - the last one with checked luggage or hand luggage only. I did receive a newspaper and a coke with one ice cube. Must describe FA as correct but not friendly - cold meal was horrible cold stodgy rice with some shrimps and a sweet and sour sauce - lucky there was a very small piece of cheese and 2 chocolates - plastic cutlery in business class. Choice of drinks was not presented - so I went for a second coke once again with one ice cube. One of the poorest business class services. Luggage was delivered in less than 20 minutes.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Had a flight from Brussels to Ouagadougou Burkina Faso which was scheduled 4 hour and 55 minutes. They re routed us with other flights to Accra Ghana then to Abdijan then to Ouagadougou to pick up more passengers. We flew right over Ouagadougou and this added 5 hours 20 minutes to our route. They did not apologize or care for the huge problems it caused or keeping us on a plane against our will for an additional 5 hours 20 minutes. I will never fly this airline again!

### Brussels Airlines customer review
MAD-BRU and BRU-BUD. Fare was competitive with the direct services of Wizz and Ryanair. Earned Star Alliance points for both segments. Crew were excellent and efficient. No IFE and the food and beverage is pay as you go (I had a cold drink). This is a regional low frills carrier but several steps above the budget alternatives available. Was nervous about a 30 minute connection in BRU but made it with time to spare and my bag made it to Budapest as well. Would definitely fly them again short haul.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Had a flight MAD-BRU on 20/02. As a Star Alliance Gold Member I had access to the lounge in Madrid. Priority boarding went smooth. Comfort and service inside the plane were OK for this short flight. Satisfying experience over all. Only negative point is that the five pieces of luggage with a priority tab were delivered last upon arrival in Brussels.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-BCN on 13/02. Easy and fast priority check in (Senator). The new SN lounge The Loft is a great place for having a drink and some food before the flight. Plane was A320. Comfort OK for the short flight. No IFE. Friendly staff.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Our outward flight to Barcelona from Birmingham was delayed by 6 hours without explanation. The return flight was delayed by 14 hours once again without explanation. The seats are uncomfortable. The hotel that we were put up in was a cheap transit type hotel with poor beds bedding and pillows. There were no curtains at the window either. The airline is trying to portray itself as a large national carrier but it is nothing more than a “tin-pot” disorganised budget airline. However the staff were friendly and did try to assist with our questions. I will never fly with this airline again and would suggest if you read this you heed my advice.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
PRG-BRU-EDI Brussels Airlines is effectively a low-cost airline disguised as a proper national flag-carrier. Cramped aircraft with extremely uncomfortable seats and on both legs of my flight absolutely no overhead luggage space meaning that I had to keep my briefcase under my feet. There were two of us in our party and yet somehow we weren't seated next to each other - and the issue was explained to me as being unsolvable by ground staff. Absurd amounts of queuing for boarding and disembarking although the way boarding was called- one would believe that there was some logic being employed. Absolutely nothing is handed for free if you are flying Economy - not even water which again goes back to the point that they are operating as a low-cost carrier. Cost of a tickets is slightly lower than the cost of ticket on e.g. Lufthansa but not as low as Easyjet or Ryanair both of which in my opinion offer a direct service superior to Brussels Airlines. Also on a side note - Brussels Airport which is the airline's hub is a nightmare.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
LHR-BRU return on A319. Small old aircraft. Seats unbelievably thin and hard even less comfy than LCC like AirAsia. Both legs departed late. However cabin attendants were friendly and helpful. It is obvious that they are doing cost-cutting but they still give water and pieces of Belgian chocolate for free. For a very short flight not bad at all.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
We flew the LIS-BRU flight leg thinking it would be a TAP flight. Unfortunately we got to experience the true horror of flying low-cost and paying normal carrier prices. No free food or drinks included. The seat must have been the worst seat I had ever sat on during a flight. Like somebody else said an iron board with a leather cover. They revisited the concept of a head rest and installed instead a flat rock to rest your head on. I guess the hard plastic of the front seat in my knees came should not have been a surprise after this. In BRU airport we were taken to the non-Schengen terminal and then with a bus to the luggage terminal. Outside through rain and snow. Overall one of the worst and deceiving flight experiences.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Hamburg-Brussels-Warsaw. Worst flying experience ever and I am quite experienced with low-cost carriers. The Hamburg-Brussels flight was late and they didn't bother to inform us until 1 minute before the gates were supposed to be closed. Thankfully Brussels-Warsaw was also late and it the only reason I made it to the gates on time. This and that I was able to run and without kids. On this flight there was not enough space to put my bag in overhead compartment designated for my seat. I asked FA to help me and she just said "You will have to keep it under your seat" without even bothering to check if any space was available. We did made it on time to Warsaw but it was horrible experience. If I missed flight to Warsaw I would have to spend night in a hotel. Never again! I'd rather fly Ryanair!

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Brussels-Lisbon 9 Nov 2014 and back 12 Nov. The plane was an A320 both ways. Departed with a delay of 10 minutes in Brussels and arrived 10 minutes early at Lisbon Airport. Plane was not full that Sunday morning (departure was 11.20). Entertainment was the flight info and some cartoons played at the general screens. FA's were very professional and friendly. For Light&Relax food and drinks were for purchase. Luggage arrived in Lisbon 30 minutes after landing. The return flight to Brussels (departure 13u45) was completely full. This time no entertainment for the 2h25 flight. Departed and landed on time. FA's this time were also very friendly and professional. One of the FA's on the flight to Lisbon recognized us and asked how was our trip to Lisbon. Arrival in Brussels was at the B- terminal (non Schengen) and we must go by bus to the Schengen terminal. Before arrival the crew announced the connecting gates for passengers in transit. Luggage was already at the belt when we arrived at the Luggage claim area.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Brussels have downgraded their intercontinental economy passengers so they don't even qualify for a snack on the connecting flights to Brussels. The flight attendants have no idea about the small print that says if you show a boarding card for the intercontinental leg you get a complimentary drink. A complete shambles Brussels reinstate the flex&fast rate for intercontinental passengers. Obviously a decision made by bureaucrats in Brussels who never use the connecting flights.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Had to fly from HAM to BHX with Brussels Airlines due to no other flight available on short notice on a Sunday. Booked the last economy seat on the flight for whopping 560 Euros. Personal space was poor and the aircraft seemed configured for the maximum seat count. Flight was 1-stop with a stop at their depressingly dull and chaotic Brussels where I had to wait 3 hours for their delayed connection to BHX. The plane turned out to be a Dash-8 Q400 turboprop. Other airlines inform you about the plane in use Brussels Airlines does not and I wouldn't have booked an insanely expensive but poor quality flight if I had known what kind of airline this is. I will certainly never fly Brussels Airlines again.

BRU-GVA-BRU C Class. Quick check-in fast lane for security and new lounge looks good but still over crowded. Boarding fast and although quite a full c cabin service was done by very experienced service. Return good check in and fast track for security plus rather good Senator Lounge in GVA. Once on board hoping to get same great experience but wrong was I only 1 row of C class and with 3 pax. Service was appalling and uneventful. Quick flight. Ambiguous feelings with SN is like a lottery ticket never know if you will win but always hoping for it! Not a continuous good service a real shame.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
We were two couples flying to Milan to celebrate a 50th birthday of one of the wives. Arrived at Manchester checked in for 6.25 am flight to Brussels. We sat on the plane for over an hour waiting for other passengers to be boarded due to lack of check in staff at Manchester. We finally took off an hour late at 7.25am. Prior to landing announcement on plane stated that New York flight had been held for passengers but all others would have to be transferred in other words we had missed our connecting flights! Upon arrival we were met by a female Brussels airline employee who just handed us new tickets and said we had been re-routed via Munich to Milan and to make matters worse to Milan Malpensa airport and not Linate airport (Linate is much nearer to Milan). She could not explain why it was okay to hold the plane in Manchester for over an hour to accommodate late passengers but they were unable to do so for us and the other passengers who missed connecting flights. We were not even shown where to go to check in for the rescheduled flights. Appalling customer service! We did try to complain at the Brussels airlines "help" desk but where met by a wall of indifference they did offer us 8 euro food vouchers. To cut a long story short we lost almost a full day of our holiday. We will never use them again.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Very pleasant flights - Venice Italy to Washington Dulles by way of Brussels. Flights were on time aircraft were clean and in excellent condition and cabin crews pleasant and attentive. Transatlantic sector was flown by an A330-300. Legroom was in coach was about 33-34 inches the most generous I've seen in recent memory. Food was good and reasonably plentiful and cabin staff passed through the aisles at least once every 30 minutes to refill water cups. Seat-back IFE was good but somewhat limited compared to other carriers' offerings (no games and a total of perhaps 30 to 40 TV shows and movies available). Would happily fly Brussels again.

BRU-VIE C class on 26-9-14. Check in a disgrace rude handler of passenger lack of staff in business counter and rude staff checked me in in eco. The employee on purpose did not print my Senator number on my boarding pass and had to re-issue the boarding pass in lounge. Temporary lounge a total disaster overcrowded and with service staff that shout and interact in between them. Usual messy boarding with no priority and once on board realised Business class was just the one first row. Crew staff totally uninterested. except a junior stewardess who kindly helped me. For the rest will not recommend.

This was a short chaotic hop from Brussels to Heathrow - Flight 2093 - on 4th September 2013. Boarding was via coach between the terminals and was chaotic. There was no priority boarding for business class it was pretty much a free for all. We were greeted by a friendly purser who showed us to our seats but did pretty much little else even when someone tried to help themselves to the free middle seats in business class until I asked her to. The plane took off 35 minutes late as then kept trying to cram passengers on consequently there was no pre flight drink. Breakfast was chucked at us 10 minutes into the flight. It consisted of half a roll with cheese and ham a yoghurt and a fruity selection which was served with a glass of champagne served from a big bottle. Service was pretty indifferent but in their defence the place was completely full. We landed at Heathrow 30 minutes late with baggage arriving in my case 20 minutes later. In my partners case 35 minutes late as despite being tagged priority was last off.

JFK to Brussels on September 3rd in Business class and were seated in 4A and 4C. We boarded the plane and were greeted by a lovely female member if crew who took our glasses and offered us a Kir Royale before takeoff. I noticed that on this run we were only offered the one rather than refills. The flight took off from JFK on time after a long taxi. 20 minutes after the seat belt light was switched off we were offered a drink which was served with a bowl of olives. Probably a figment of my imagination but the drink service didn't seem as generous on this flight and the meal service seemed to have been downgraded - for example there was no Star Chef selection on this flight. The monthly cocktail also has been downgraded to a monthly beer. Menu cards were distributed and an amenity kit with not much in handed out - usefully though it doubles as an IPad holder which is a nice touch. Twenty minutes later the meal service began. Starters were a choice of Smoked breast of duck or Green tea dusted seaweed wrapped scallop. I had the scallop which was terrific. Mains were a choice of Sesame Crusted Beef with butternut squash purée or Herb crusted seared salmon with a tomato courgette gratin or Blue Cheese Gnocchi with sautéed spinach. I had the beef which could have been hotter to be honest but was still excellent. I chose an excellent 2012 South African Chenin Blanc which was recommended by the purser and was a great choice. This was followed by a cheese plate. The meal service took about an hour of the 6.5 hour night flight. After dinner I stretched out in the large lie flat bed and settled back to watch a movie as I thought it was pointless to try and get loads of sleep. Crew came round a couple of times with water. The seat is very comfortable and the massage function nice. There was also a better selection of films on this flight that were more up to date than my previous flight. An hour before landing we were served a continental breakfast of fruit yoghurt and warm bread with fruit juice and coffee before landing in Brussels around 20 minutes early. The crew were lovely on this flight led by a male purser they were warm friendly professional and respectful which I liked. I noticed that the box of chocolates given on the outward flight was replaced by a much smaller packet of Almond Thins. The service offered by Brussels Airlines for the price is brilliant. It takes you back to days when airline actually cared about their customers which I found refreshing and enjoyable.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Brussels to JFK on SN501 on 24th August - we travelled in Business Class - seats 2A and 2C. Upon boarding the flight our jackets were taken and stowed by friendly crew and we were offered pre take off drinks including Champagne and a delicious Kir Royale. The first thing that grabbed me was the size of the seat which has a great amount of space around it and the large TV screen in the seat which is great. The flight took off on time and shortly after pre lunch drinks were served with a smoked salmon and caviar appetiser. The crew distributed the menus with food including dishes created by Michelin Star restaurateur Thomas Locus. The lunch menu consisted of a starter of either Romaine Lettuce Salad served with North Sea shrimp and avocado or Middle Eastern Style Lamb served with baba ghanoush. I had the shrimp it was one of the most attractively presented dishes that I have had in a plane and it was delicious. Mains were a choice of Waterzooi style farm raised chicken with IJsvaller watercress and ravioli with ox heart cabbage or Fillet of Cod with verge sauce and roast potatoes with Rosemary and sugar snap peas or Agnolotti pasta with arugula sauce. I had the chicken which was succulent and juicy and delicious. It's also worth mentioning that my travelling companion had ordered a Lacto Vegetarian meal which as a main was a superb Mushroom and Spinach curry. We were then offered a cheese plate and dessert. There was a decent selection of wines available which were generously topped up throughout the meal. After lunch we settled back to relax for a few hours - the seat extends into a bed which is very comfortable and enabled me to sleep. Crew served ice cream and drinks runs were regularly offered. The big let down was the inflight entertainment which was pretty disappointing with a mediocre selection of film and TV series available - luckily I had my trusty IPad so was able to catch up on some stuff I had downloaded. 90 minutes before JFK a snack was served - this was a goats cheese salad with duck and apricots which was delicious. Crew were lovely throughout and provided a great unobtrusive service. A nice touch was we were given a box of Neuhaus chocolates each to thank us for flying with them. We arrived in JFK 45 minutes early relaxed and refreshed having thoroughly enjoyed the experience before bracing ourselves for the hour long queue at Immigration.

BRU-BCN in B flex economy. I booked well in advance at a low priced one way and did an upgrade bid to B flex. This entitled me to fast lane security and a snack (pizza) on board and drinks included. Additionally you could buy lounge access at another 15 euros which I did. Lounge at gate A section was on the small side but standard snacks/sandwiches provided. Staff onboard/lounge/check in were very friendly and able to communicate in Dutch. Flight was operated with a 319 and I was seated on row 2. Leg-space was minimal and no separation was made on board (1 row c class-1 pax) row 2-3 Eco flex rest economy with BOB. I did find I got value for money especially including lounge access with free wifi. On board magazine and newspaper offered. No taxfree/shopping service. Just 3 crew members. A decent 3 star airline. Flight was delayed by 30 mins.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
We flew from Brussels to NYC and it was a very unpleasant trip. The attendant was unprofessional and little help and assistance was given to families. Myself and young child sat at the front while my husband sat at the front. There are many airlines that flight this route and have choices. Little entertainment for young children. We were in transit and not enough time to get to our gate. I would not recommend to family and friends.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
A very pleasant quick 40 minutes hop from Heathrow to Brussels seated in rows 1A and 1c - greeted by friendly staff who served a glass of champagne before takeoff take off on time and inflight service was an acceptable continental breakfast for a short flight with champagne - a better option is the vegetarians special breakfast which is a fruit plate. Friendly discreet non intrusive service was good and we landed in Brussels 10 minutes ahead of schedule.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Party of two business class on an Avro RJ from Stockholm-Bromma to Brussels. Facilities at Bromma are quite desolate and overpriced though I don't suppose that's Brussels Airlines fault. However they probably have enough influence to put in some more chairs. Despite the fact that the terminal is essentially a re-purposed hangar it is in a great location and for that reason we were thankful that Brussels Airlines flew there instead of the more crowded and less convenient Arlanda Airport. Once we got on board we were somewhat surprised that the business class seats were identical in their physicality to those in the economy sections. However our fears that we had not gotten what we paid for were lifted once we discovered that the seats were quite comfortable and the legroom between the seat and the bulkhead (The Avro’s sole row of business class seats is the front-most row just behind the bulkhead) was more than adequate and the flight attendants were very attentive spoke decent English and served meals that were in their quality above the normality for short-haul flights. Hot washcloths were available at the beginning of the flight and later on upon request. No "real" IFE but newspapers in a variety of languages were given to the business class passengers as were various magazines some published by the airline some not. I read the New York Times and the Economist both of which were available in English. The airline also had a magazine in English French and German highlighting its various destinations. Overall the experience was very pleasant and we would do it again.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
With one exception most aspects of my flight were either good or average. Unfortunately the ill-designed seats on their long haul flight mean that I wont be flying with them again until I am certain that their fleet of Airbus A330's have been replaced. The seats have hard and thick adjustable headrests which appear to have been added as an afterthought meaning that the head is pushed 7cm or so forward of the shoulders. This affected all of the similarly disgruntled passengers in my vicinity with the exception of children not big enough to reach the headrest. If you are planning a trip with Brussels Airlines try sitting with your head stuck out 7cm forward of your shoulders whilst going through the booking procedure and see how it feels. Then imagine how it will feel after 8 hours and book with a different airline. There are about 5 airlines running between Europe and Uganda now and nothing would make me choose Brussels above the others. It is a shame that something so easy to get right as a seat which is the same shape as a human being renders this airline unusable because the rest of the service was fine and timings excellent. The crew were great the food acceptable and entertainment good.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-CPH. Economy flex. Brussels airlines operates this route as a duopoly with SAS and it shows in the fares that are charged. My travel plans depended on the weather forecast in Denmark so I was only able to book 72 hours in advance. The cheaper of the two economy cabins had sold out on all 3 flights. The flexible ticket cost about 3 times the advertised minimum fare. Despite this I was charged 8 euros for paying with a credit card (none of my debit cards were accepted by the airline's web site). The ticket allowed fast track security although as this lane was merged into others there was no advantage. Extra cabin baggage was also allowed but as the ground staff did not enforce the cabin baggage policy this was again no advantage. The flight left 20 minutes late as the handling agent had not loaded the bags in time. The seat had no head rest and felt like it had almost no padding a bit like resting on a leather covered ironing board. There was no magazine in the seat pocket. The advertised free light meal/snack was a bread roll with two slices of cheese with terrible coffee served in a small paper cup. The stewardess even had the nerve to tell me to enjoy my meal as she handed me the bread roll. In my opinion this airline provides budget service at legacy carrier prices.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Malaga -Brussels in business. Flight delayed by 1hr average service not enough attentive to customers needs. Separation between business and economy b flex does not exist no privacy. Food is very average nearly bad and non tasty b flex meals seem better. The quality / price ratio was very bad a return ticket for a 2h45 flight is around 900 euros. Experience is not worth the money spent.

JFK-BRU C Class. Just one word to describe SN and its services on Transatlantic routes - vile! All is wrong check-in lounge boarding and once onboard is all total chaos and inflight service is so average! They have lost it completely only fly them when there is no other alternative available. Will not recommend.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
We recently flew with this airline from Brussels to Lyon France. An hour before departure with our boarding passes already in hand we discovered that the flight had been cancelled. A half-mile trek back to their desk and we were informed that we would be put on a flight to Geneva and then a bus to Lyon. There were about thirty of us and when we arrived in Geneva we had to wait in the baggage claims area for an hour and a half-standing until the bus arrived. We arrived about 4 hours late in Lyon. No excuse was given for the cancellation and when I wrote to the airlines for an explanation I received no reply in return.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
I flew a few days ago from BRU to Cagliari and back. I didn't check-in online on purpose as I wanted to see how the ground staff were. Both were very friendly professional and polite especially the purser on the way back from CAG. Definitely a positive experience regarding customer service but poor catering service for the price paid. Would expect more for sure. Anyway very satisfied with everything else including the legroom on their Airbus A319.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Took morning flight GVA-BRU on 4 July 2014. The plane A319 was clean and well maintained however legroom could be better. Departed and arrived at the gate in BRU with slight delay. Cabin crew very professional and efficient. The food they serve in premium economy - a microscopic sandwich with margarine and cheese - is absolutely deplorable and is the worst sandwich I ever had. So the airline that claims having the best economy premium product in Europe should be ashamed. Taking into account the price they charge for premium economy on this short flight and substandard food quality I definitely can not recommend their premium economy service to anyone.

TLV-BRU in C class terrible check in staff are rude attitude. Lounge is "Dan" which is crowded and sadly dirty. boarding a mess! Once on board their little Airbus is better that LH mother company. Did some shopping on board nothing worked rightly their card machine and the loyalty programme card neither vile but rather sorry staff tried to compensate with smile thanks but no thanks I want my miles end of story. On board not so bad on time and good baggage delivery although will not recommend. SN get your act together if you want loyal pax.

Excellent. Service on plane was attentive and friendly. Food was good and plentiful. Customer Service very good. We left a fold up stool on the plane at Brussels. When we got home we contacted customer service. They returned the stool to my home airport. We were very happy with Brussels airline and would recommend it.

BRU-FLR. Online check-in did not work as ticket was issued on Lufthansa resulting in having bad seats. Cabin crew made the pleasant and the stewardess apologized for the bad seats. Flight left with delay but arrived on time in Florence. Brussels Airlines but their product and seat comfort is not to be compared with for example Swiss and Lufthansa especially not within Europe!

### Brussels Airlines customer review
I flew from London to Nairobi and back. My flight was late to depart once in the air my inflight entertainment never worked. I informed a few stewardesses but none seemed to do anything about it and needless to say it was a long flight for me. The food was great but the attitude to my issue by the flight crew made me have a very displeased view of the airline. I got to my destination and my baggage was nowhere to be found misinformation by their Nairobi office made me make two unnecessary trips to the Airport and finally after 5 days I got my belongings. My intention for this trip had been delayed for that time and needless to say I could not make it back as planned since I had to finish the business that took me there. The Airline refused to reschedule me on another flight as they were booked but had a seat for the full price if I did not want to wait another week to get a rescheduled flight with minimum penalty. I paid them and vowed never to fly Brussels again it was my first time using them and I have not made that mistake again.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Flew BRU-VIE-BRU and the experience pretty much equalled to a low-cost airline. They do not even serve any water or juice. Staff in general quite cold I was completely ignored when boarding my flight to Vienna. Planes were rather old. Inefficient boarding. Overall experience is fine but knowing you have other options for less amount of money does not make Brussels Airlines a company to recommend.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
I flew PRG-BRU and SN proved again to be the most expensive low cost I know. When people were boarding 5 minutes before scheduled departure I knew it was going to be delayed. It was eventually delayed one hour (only partially because of some problem with the towing truck). All food for purchase in Economy - that came with no surprise (unfortunately there is not much option between BRU-PRG so I have to fly with them occasionally) but the smell of food coming from "business" was not good (I sat in row 7). The reading light did not work and the plane interior felt old and dilapidated. When we were waiting (approx. 30min) for fixing the problem with the towing truck and the de-icing they did not bother to switch on the lights for people to read. The staff must be paid not to smile and to be rude.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Flew LHR-BRU-ABJ return in December on business class on way out flight was operated by FlyHi of Portugal without very low standard of business class old plane poor staff no in flight entertainment but at least some additional legroom and reasonable food. On return at check in was told "business class not up to usual standard" so I assumed it would be the same as outward leg. On entering the plane (again FlyHi) I found it was all economy. I am surprised Brussels Airlines don't have one spare plane to operate the service!

I was flying from Brussels to Abidjan / Cote d' Ivoire and back in December 2013. The original plane had broken down Brussels Airlines used a subcontracted charter - Hi fly on both trips. Despite a business upgrade on both flights only economy service with "business seats". Seats uncomfortable and not adjustable. Crew extremely unfriendly. Lounge in Abidjan a catastrophe. Flights in both directions delayed by about three hours the flight back starting around 3 am in the morning.

BRU-JFK A330-300 Business Class. Efficient check-in very friendly staff most comfortable seats superb lunch with excellent wines full box of Neuhaus pralines as present. Arrival on the dot. Only negative side of this flight: 1hr 15 queuing at US immigration but that is beyond airline's control. JFK-BRU A330-300 Business class cabin crew coped well with full house supper and wines on high level good full flat sleeping seats. Overall a most enjoyable experience recommended.

Washington-BRU on Nov 21st. Newly equipped Airbus for this flight. Perfectly on time. I am a frequent flyer of Brussels in Europe. The worse disappointment on this airbus is the poor comfort of the economy cabin. Compared to Lufthansa you seem to sit on a wooden bench! The video equipment is latest generation though the least as you can't manage to sleep!

I flew with Brussels from GVA via BRU to DKR and thereon from PNR via BRU to GVA. I have to admit that this was a very pleasant experience. The inflight personnel were very polite and helpful ready to attend to any request. The only question that they were unable to answer on my flight from PNR to GVA via BRU was which city would organize the Olympics of 2020 since I was flying back on that exact date. Having flown with SQ/LH/AF/TK/LX I would rate them equal to SQ business class.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Brussels-Dakar return in economy. Very pleasantly surprised. Smart new cabins on A330. Comfortable seats with adjustable headrests and best economy class legroom I encountered for a long time. Very tasty food outbound (nasty in-bound) no problem getting top-ups on drinks. Flights on time both ways cabin crew friendly and efficient. Brussels airport a much nicer place to be than Paris CDG the other main hub for Africa flights. Only let-down was the in-flight entertainment. It's a modern on-demand system with a nice big touch screen and useful USB port but choice of movies and music was poor and the flight map function too clever for its own good - it seemed to endlessly show places hundreds of miles away with silly captions like 'historical city of Venice' and only occasionally made it clear where you actually are!

### Brussels Airlines customer review
I flew with Brussels airlines yesterday evening from Brussels to Venice. Short delay of 10 min flight quite empty so had two seats for myself. Aircraft looked old when choosing the seat via online check- in it showed an emergency row seat with extra legroom but there were no emergency exits in the middle of the plane. In economy light drinks and snacks only for purchase which I think is poor for a proper airline - especially when € 150 more expensive than Ryanair. Staff pleasant enough.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
FLR-BRU 7th October. Checked in at 10.30 for this flight which was scheduled for departure at 12.30. At 12.30 no plane and announced a departure at 12.50 but at 12.50 still no plane. After a while we found out our plane landed in Pisa. Information was limited and unclear. At 14.30 we were bussed from Florence to Pisa (where we had to go through security once again). In Pisa our flight was not on the board but after a while we were called to the gate and finally took off at 16.20. Pilot excused for the delay and said he had to land in Pisa due to bad weather above Florence and he only had for 15 minutes spare fuel. I heard about limited fuel amounts with low cost carriers but prices at Brussels Airlines are all except low cost. As compensation for the almost 4 hour delay we were offered as compensation one free coffee tea water or soft drink! We were handed a menu as if we wanted some food we could buy this from the menu. I do not understand what Brussels Airlines is doing in the Star Alliance Group I am a frequent traveller but SN just always leaves me with very bad experiences. This flight certainly didn't make it any better and I will try to avoid them in the future as much as possible.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
A big disappointment: Check in was a total disaster with a messy line up lasting for ages and inefficient attendants. Seating and staff service on board are like those of a low cost airline. Food and beverages were the only part of this flight that was not below average yet that does not help much when the whole journey is so uncomfortable.

12-15 September 2013 - MAN-BRU-MAN. Outbound flight was on behalf of Flybe Dash 8 - delayed by 40 mins plane interior bright. Flight attendants very helpful complimentary drinks and snacks provided on return journey also. Pleasantly surprised with seats - wide and plenty of leg room. Downside is that seats were bookable upon check - in online 24hrs prior to departure. Return journey from Brussels - Manchester - the departure gate was changed twice and on both occasions only notified 20 mins before we were due to depart. It was our first time using online check in - smooth transaction good inflight service. I would fly with Brussels Airlines in the future.

I would highly recommended to fly with Brussels Airline and I will definitely fly with them again.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Flew BRU-PMO return this past week. Airline embraces a big "economy" tag charging for even drinks (a cool 3 Euro for a soda for example) and not allowing advance seat selection unless you pay extra. It also at least on what are considered "short" flights-and I'd suggest that the BRU-PMO route at 2.5 hours is pushing the limits of this-has some very thinly padded economy seats. No in-flight entertainment. But enough of the complaining: the planes were clean staff was professional baggage got delivered and best of all flights were on time. So a good experience and a recommendation.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Brussels Airlines canceled my flight from Washington Dulles to Brussels the day of departure and never notified me. I called the airline to confirm my seats in the afternoon. On the way to the airport my son saw that the airport website said it was canceled. I called the main Brussels Air # and the automated message said that it was on-time so we continued toward the airport. I decided to call back and talk to a person who said that yes it was canceled due to a mechanical fault and the plane had never left Brussels for the US. Thus when I called about the seats the airline already knew there was no plane but the agent who confirmed my seats didn't. I asked to be re-booked but was told that since my flight was booked through United I had to call them. After over an hour on the phone with United we got a flight to Paris the next day. Never made it Brussels and never booking on Brussels Airlines again.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-IAD this past week in economy. Flew in A330 in Economy class. Seats were a bit cramped-as to be expected in Economy. In light entertainment was good; service was very good. Flight was on time and luggage arrived. Based on this experience would recommend for long-haul flight would fly again.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
I flew Brussels Airlines on a code share trip with United (where I am a mileage plus platinum) and was very disappointed. Brussels Airlines employees don't care about customer service. They did not assign me a seat until I was at the airport and by then only a middle seat was available on a 6 hour trip to Yaound Cameroon. There is no customer service phone number that works so you can't even complain. Their service is below standard. By contrast on the return flight the United code share airline was Lufthansa who upgraded me to business class without my asking for it.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-NCE-BRU: Flight booked using miles. Was booked in B.flex. Seats in the front of the plane free middle seat on both flights. Outbound flight was in the afternoon with tasty pizza and several drink services (received a couple of wines). Inbound flight was an early morning flight on which we received the typical monty's breakfast wrap. Neuhaus chocolates on both flights. Both flights arrived early. Only negative: long wait for the luggage in Brussels.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-Porto. Despite checking in on-line the queues at Brussels were painfully slow and long with check in desks (particularly luggage drop off) woefully undermanned. The situation was not helped by the new weigh your luggage and print your own luggage tags check in desks which people appeared to be struggling with. Despite a late change of gate flight took off almost on time and was pretty uneventful. The A319 makes a nice change from the Avro 100s. Service was pretty perfunctory from the usual Brussels Airlines older hostesses who whilst being professional showed little real interest in passengers - and certainly not those in B lite economy! Brussels Airlines have become very expensive and I will only use them again if I can find a reasonably priced ticket and because they fly from Brussels (and not Charleroi! ).

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Brussels BRU - Moscow DME - Brussels BRU. Good service clean and modern cabin comfortable seats (even in economy) and good food and drinks. The chocolates you get with your coffee made by the prestigious Belgian brand Neuhaus is a nice touch. The crew handled a drunken passenger very professionally and correctly. No entertainment but short haul so not really necessary. In comparison to other airline companies fair price. Will fly again and would definitely recommend.

BRU-DME-BRU in b.light (lowest economy fare). Enjoyable flights on nearly full A320 aircraft.

No in-flight entertainment. 45 minute delay on leaving Moscow no explanations given by ground staff. Excellent value.

Brussels - Toulouse in B.Flex. They have great staff at check-in at the gate and in the air! We were seated in the front of the cabin as we had a B.Flex ticket. We received a warm and tasty snack together with a drink. We had the choice between wine soft drinks beer coffee and tea. After the service the friendly purser asked if we would like to have an other drink. Before the descent the came with Neuhaus chocolates. Captain and purser were saying goodbye when we left the aircraft.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Prague via Brussels to Lisbon. We had bought our tickets several months before the trip. During that time the flights were changed at least 5 times. New departure was worse and worse. We chose the flight only because of the time of departure. From both noon or afternoon departures they changed to the first morning flights which was after 6 am from Prague for example. We did not agree they offered us to return money only or to take their stupid early flights. On time when they offered us to return money for tickets the price was about 100% higher. This is the only airline where staff do not say good morning and good-bye to passengers.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Toulouse to Brussels on 4 August 2013 was 3 hours late. I had a b-light ticket so expected no service (I live in Belgium and know the airline). However I found out entirely by chance that there was a delay - SN knew because the delay had started at the Brussels end - but there was no attempt to inform passengers at any time. The monitors announced boarding times and "Go to gate" at the normal time but no staff no plane. No attempt at any time by SN or other staff to inform or provide even water or a snack. When a bored lady appeared at the gate (the plane had landed at last) she treated the passengers' complaints/requests with bored derision. Same thing on board: a free drink as long as it was water or a Coke. I asked for a sandwich. Sure that will be 3 Euros please etc. Avoid this airline.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
JFK-BRU upgrade in Business Class. JFK-BRU is a flagship route of Brussels Airlines featuring their new cabin. Seats in Business are excellent full flat bed with a lot of space. Actually gives an impression of more space than on the seats in diagonal you can find in many business class cabins (e.g. Air Canada). Food was very good decent choice of wine. Good to see Belgian items on the menu (even from JFK): spa water neuhaus pralines a taste of home abroad.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-CPH return and BRU-BUD return c cabin 1 row only in all 4 legs either Avro or Airbus! Vile check in although Senator status. They seem to have a problem with lounges access in Europe. BRU lounge in the Schengen Terminal is always full packed and badly serviced! In other capitals the lounges are atrocious! Once on board staff are correct but not top notch. Bar service is ok but food is inedible. Seats need in all services either c or light or eco revamping like yesterday! In fact is the same seat although the policy one in - the middle free. Unfortunately they seem to be going down the drain. Heard they are a lot better with long distance services. Short and medium haul are just a laugh and they are not competitive on prices timetables nor service.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
JFK-BRU-JFK in January 2013. Check in very quick both ways. Lufthansa Lounge at JFK was nothing to write home about however the Sunrise Lounge in BRU was very good. Seats are very comfortable and adjust to your body's sleeping position. Single seats in row 1 are best as you get the most room for your legs. IFE was pretty good. Food wise I ordered a special meal (Lacto-ovo vegetarian). Surprisingly the catering was better out of JFK. Lovely mozzarella pearl salad with tomatoes and cheese ravioli among other things plus a beautiful fruit plate and various cheeses for dessert. Standard breakfast tray with a warm croissant and yoghurt etc was simple and tasty. Catering out of BRU was disappointing. Served a vegan meal which did not suit my needs. Despite efforts to find alternatives the only thing that could be found was fruit. I was given an unopened bottle of champagne to take with me and was urged to complain which yielded 2000 miles. Service overall was pretty good. Would I recommend Brussels Airlines? Yes.

Flight b flex BRU-TLS and TLS-BRU. Baggage drop off in BRU complete chaos an arrogant (and rather stupid) young employee of Brussels airlines sent people to the baggage drop off queue for the Africa flights where the line was even much longer. No difference was made between b light and b flex passengers. Flight was OK in old Avrojet. Catering in b flex is a joke the same small pizza on both flights. Once the company named b flex the best economy class in Europe. Forget it. Only plus point: staff are extremely friendly.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
We flew from Venice to Brussels this week on SN. The ticket was purchased with United Airlines as a Star Alliance code share (I am Star Alliance Gold). The paperwork clearly said "snack" - which I assumed to be a drink and light snack as Swiss Air provided us a few days earlier on another code share flight. However the flight attendant said we had to pay 3 Euro each for a bottle of water. He said I should have read the SN web site and not the code share ticket information which he said was wrong. Why should code share customers have to understand all this? I really just wanted some water for our child and decided on principle that I wouldn't give 3 Euros. SN is inconsistent with its star alliance competitors in Europe - I would not recommend them if you are buying code share flights.

Flew from Brussels to Kigali on 13 July and found the service to be very good. Food was tasty good selection of movies plane was very clean and seats comfortable. Only downside was the Brussels Airlines ground staff at Brussels Airport who are not very helpful.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-TLV May 2013. C class cabin although using A319 on this route service was really bad food inedible and audio and video a shame. They need to get their act together in order to be a good airline with competitive service and pax satisfaction. Sorry but would not recommend although have reached Senator status.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
I had the pleasure of flying SN 515 on 25 June BRU-IAD. From the check-in staff to the cabin crew all were more than professional. The cabin crew were outstanding! Never once did I have to ask or ring for them. The food was excellent and the wines perfect. The real charm was a large box of Belgian chocolates as a gift for being their guest. Highly recommended.

MAN-BRU-ATH. Can't say much about the first leg all I know that it was a Dash 8 the service was good and it was bumpy. The second leg was better. we were impressed with the service; that's all I can really say. It was the cheapest we could find.

SN 2624 HAM-BRU on 24 May 2013. SN 3816 LIS-BRU on 26 May 2013. SN 2629 BRU-HAM on 26 May 2013. Nice new Airbuses. Good Recaro seats throughout that provide ample legroom even in Economy for a 189 m tall person. Friendly staff and departure on time. A really bad downturn however is that in the lowest fare class not even a free soft drink is provided! Its not a no-frill airline but a full star-alliance member. On the second leg with TAP this was no problem even alcohol was served for free.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Low cost airline but without low cost. After 3 hours sitting on the plane the staff came and asked everybody whether anybody wanted to buy drinks! Credit card accepted. On a low cost airline like Ryanair I would understand this that's their low cost strategy. Brussels Airlines is an airline like Lufthansa Swiss and so on and are not cheaper at all. On all other airlines you get at least drink.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
FRA-BRU-FIH and back in business class. Service in Business class improved a lot since last year! I find Brussels Airlines better than mother company Lufthansa. Service in Business class is almost at the same level of Swiss. They have great seats on board very good food and excellent staff at the gate and on board. I was greeted with a smile while entering the plane during the service and when I left the aircraft. The dinner service was quite good especially for a 6hr 30 min transatlantic flight. Brussels Airlines is a small but very nice company I will fly them again in the future!

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-JFK A330-300. The flagship route of SN but a decidedly mixed experience. While the seat pitch was excellent for Y and AVOD was decent food was pretty mediocre and staff service was poor even by American standards with rude flight attendants who ignored passengers and forgot the simplest requests.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Oslo-Brussels-Banjul. First time travelling with Brussels Airlines - certainly not the last! Enjoyed the service from Oslo with easy connection in Brussels. Most impressive though the service from Brussels-Banjul. Brand new aircraft. Very comfortable and relaxing. Staff did their utmost to serve passengers. Will use Brussels again. Only negative - the "pillows" attached to the seats. A little uncomfortable should have been a little bit softer.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
I flew with this airline from Brussels to London. The check-in process was fine as was the bag drop too. Queue management was not very good at all and caused a few concerns to say the least. I found the cabin to be clean and tidy and in good order. The crew were pleasant and efficient if rather lacking in ability to deal with 3 rowdy passengers. I had the cheapest seating option and for a short flight it was tolerable!

### Brussels Airlines customer review
I flew BRU-JFK-BRU in Business Class. From check-in to de-boarding the crew were very nice and service minded. The sunrise lounge in Brussels is great and offers a nice view. The new cabin is very nice and offers full flat beds. Flight was to short to try all the features. Great food and wines! Would recommend them and I will fly Brussels Airlines again.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
FCO-BRU-OSL. Early bird flight out of Rome A320 boarded last and ignored assigned seat in crowded forward section aiming for empty row at back of plane. Ended up in last row. Excellent legroom! And recline! A pleasant surprise! Seats are the new light-weight paper-thin plastic buss-like product so many low-cost carriers adore - hence comfort is in accordance. But the legroom and the recline on the last row of this A320 was superb. Downside Cabin staff yapped without pause in aft galley for the duration of the flight. BRU-OSL: A146. Like stepping into a time-warp. 1994-style cabin (at best) but again great legroom and recline! All male cabin staff - friendly. If price is right would fly again - solely because of the ample legroom and comfy recline. Which are the only things that separates this carrier from below par low cost everyday standard air travel.

Brussels-Rome return. Good fare excellent flight new plane comfortable seats polite and helpful staff both flights left on time.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
We boarded in Brussels (20-01-13) and sat in the chilly cabin for 5.5 hrs and waited before we finally departed. No free drinks or food served and very little information was given about the reason for the long delay. Once we landed in Copenhagen we were not informed that no ones luggage had been loaded onto the plane. Naturally everybody went to retrieve their luggage at the pickup area with the official information saying that our luggage would be arriving on the belts shortly. Everybody ended up waiting almost another 2 hours for their luggage to arrive with another plane with no official information given about the reason. So in conclusion: Brussels Airlines is poorly managed even down to the most basic services. I would much rather pay a bit more for my plane ticket next time around to avoid using Brussels Airline.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-PRG Airbus A319. In business class the space between the seats (I was in the second row) was no more then in economy class. Food was nothing special 2 wraps and half a sandwich. I choose an airline for good quality at a good price so this was my last flight with Brussels. Service needs to improve!

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-NYC in Economy. Very nice experience over all. Check in and pre-boarding a bit confused but ok. Seat pitch very nice for economy and being quite tall really a plus. Cocktails and snacks served after take off followed by a quite good meal for economy. Followed by coffee and the and ice-cream. They could have come through the cabin with water more often and in general the cabin service was correct but somewhat reserved. In-flight entertainment quite good with personal screens and a nice selection. Altogether a very nice economy experience.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
We flew from Brussels to Yaounde Cameroon. The plane developed engine trouble and Brussels Airlines kindly provided luncheon vouchers. When it became clear that our flight wasn't going anywhere we were bussed to a very nice hotel for an overnight stay and given dinner and breakfast. The flight took off the next morning without delay. The service was first rate and they even gave us chilled champagne in economy class! The food was hot and tasty the entertainment units were very good the seats were comfortable with more legroom than Air Canada and the cabin crew were friendly and accommodating. The return flight was just as good. It's Brussels Airlines for us in future!

SN 3292 TLV-BRU Mon 12 Nov 20122. SN 3291 BRU-TLV Fri 16 Nov 2012. Basically OK. The seats are fairly comfortable though I wish they would recline more service OK security good food bearable the main con being the lack of entertainment.

SN Brussels Airlines - C class Bristol Brussels. Terrible check in and boarding unused c class counter agent was a disgrace and rude. Not at all apologetic. Some golfers flying cattle class were checked in first. Wonder why? The whole process including "fast lane" is a laugh - a shame because later on all went well. SN were using BMI plane for this very short leg Bristol Brussels cabin service was quite ok smallest commercial pax plane I have ever boarded. Only me C pax in cabin Very experienced and pleasant crew - Bristol based. On time at arrival and luggage too. Would fly SN again and would recommend!

### Brussels Airlines customer review
LHR-BRU-LHR. Almost empty on the way out almost at capacity on the way home. Both flights on time and although the seats were reasonably comfy the leg room was pretty tight. No inflight service for economy everything is for purchase but as it's only 45 minutes or so in the air this isn't a huge issue.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-LHR on what was supposed to be a short flight but given the usual LHR delays arrived half an hour late. Basically no service onboard flight half-empty. Besides the free checked bag minimal difference from any true budget carrier. Comfortable seats clean interior nothing to recommend besides.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
As a family traveling with a pair of baby twins we received a tremendous amount of help from the crew. My husband and I (and 8 month twin babies) traveled from New York to Hamburg via Brussels for 3 hours. We felt un-rushed between flights during our layover and onboard. Greeted with smiles and remained that way through the flight even holding my meal in the back until the babies fell asleep. Flight was full 8 hours and they made it comfortable for everyone.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Booked trip PRG-SXB via BRU return short connection (1 hr) confirmed as sufficient. Web check reminder came exactly 24 hrs before flight by e-mail. First leg delayed by technical reasons for about 30 mins. RJ100 not very clean sunshield broken. Upon my request the crew denied to arrange any fast transfer to connecting flight (hand baggage only). Despite the staff attitude and thanks to the same gate concourse in BRU I have just made the boarding. Second leg operated by Flybe crew but SN plane (Dash 8 Q400) only 20 pax on board small snack provided (opposite to the first leg). On return I tried successfully mobile webckeck but no one was able to answer in advance whether this will be accepted by the Strasbourg airport - I was recommended to check-in at the SXB though but on the spot was informed this is alright. Some 1 hour before departure it was clear that flight to BRU is delayed. I just managed to check Brussels airport website to find out that expected delay will result in missing the 1 hr connection to Prague (and having night in BRU and morning flight to PRG on the SN costs naturally). Immediately I received call from SN booking center with offer of replacement direct flight by CSA taking me home 2 hrs sooner than original schedule without additional charges and swiftly received new e-ticket and proceeded to check-in. Therefore despite not being in the same alliance as CSA SN has made great service on the return and will not hesitate to fly with them again.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
NCE-BRU-NCE. Check-in efficient. A little delay due to a technical problem and a lost passenger inside the Nice Terminal. Economy seating quite spacious in an A319 and surprising amount of legroom. Food and drinks are for purchase however the choice offered and the quality proposed is largely worth the expense. Flight arrived with a 20 minute delay however the disembarking process went on quickly. As always at BRU bags tend to take some time to arrive but the labyrinth that gets you there does somehow reduce the sense of wait. Return flight even better. Same quality service as outbound without the delay in an A320. Worth both your money and your time. Even with buy-on- board food.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
New York City to Bilbao Spain connecting through Brussels. The flights were wonderful - punctual check-in and boarding times excellent service from friendly staff very good beverage and food service. The entertainment on the flight New York to Brussels was great - each seat has their own screen and a good selection of films audio or games to choose from. On the flight Brussels to Bilbao (about 2 hours) we were served beverages and a warm meal. That just doesn't happen anymore on flights within the United States so it was a welcome surprise. No charge for anything in- flight - alcohol headphones pillows blankets. The way it used to be (and should be).

### Brussels Airlines customer review
LHR-BRU-VNO.A319 to BRU then RJ100. Leg room better on RJ. Food and drink to buy. This is my only gripe as flights booked through Lufthansa.com but without Lufthansa service due to code share.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
TXL-BRU-BJL-BRU-TXL. European flights in b.flex intercontinental ones in business class. Since I last flew Brussels Airlines in b.flex there has been a significant decline in service. A year ago you received a little tray with a salad a cold meal and hot bread rolls. Now it is down to a sandwich or a croissant depending on the time of day. European business class seemed to be down-graded too. In business you get now what you used to get in b.flex. Intercontinental flights in business class however were quite a different matter. On the way out to Banjul the plane was equipped with the new business-class seats. In one row the seating arrangement is 1-2-1 in the next 2-1-2. Beds are fully lie-flat beds now. Meals were of an excellent quality for airline food and flight attendants were attentive and constantly refilled your glasses. On the return to Brussels the cabin layout in business class was the old 2-2-2 seating so no lie-flat beds which was a pity as it was a night flight departing at 22.45 local time. Service was a bit rushed but then everyone was eager to get at least a couple of hours of sleep before breakfast was served at 5.45 CET.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-MAD-BRU in b.light. Both flights on-time with friendly crew. Remarkable only a 2-minute wait for luggage in Madrid. Space extremely tight on nearly full B737-400 which makes for two very uncomfortable two-hour flights.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Brussels-Bilbao-Brussels on Avro 100 in b flex (economy plus service). Cabin crew on the outbound flight were great very warm and service was of a near business level (excellent food pre flight drink multiple drinks excellent for such a short flight). Inbound flight crew seemed more hurried and less interested but service was still superior to many other airlines. The airplane was getting a bit old but had a very comfortable 2-3 set up.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
I am happy to note Brussels Airlines have renovated their Fleet providing more comfort for travellers. Return flight from Nice to Brussels in Business Class (A319) on 12th May was well run with a friendly and efficient crew. Afternoon snack was tasty and appreciated. This Airline is worth trying.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
LYS-BRU-LHR first flight on Avro RJ100 second on Avro RJ85. Good flight though 2nd a little late due to aircraft late arrival. Both crews professional and friendly with interesting en-route information in 3 languages. Food and drinks prices correct despite limited choice. Good value but long transit in Brussels (4 hours). Luggage delivered quickly in LHR. Bus shuttle from aircraft to terminal in LHR unfortunately adds to the delay and no remarks from crew to the passenger in front of me who didn't put his seat in the upright position on landing apart from that a smooth flight.

### Brussels Airlines customer review

BRU-MAN-BRU in b.light. Straightforward hassle-free lights. Outbound flight in nearly full RJ 100 return flight RJ 85. Easy mobile check-in no delays and remarkably no wait for luggage in BRU. Food for purchase menu totally uninspiring. Reasonable value for 137 euro return.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-LHR and FCO-BRU. Avro RJ85 on first leg and 737-300 on second. Both aircraft looked tired old and in need of reconditioning. Brussels Airlines is really a low cost airline "dressed-up" as a major. Not a single cup of water offered onboard. At FCO hand luggage was weighted and as there were the 4 of us they forced us to move bits from hand luggage to checked baggage. As a frequent flyer I travel 3 times a year over the Atlantic and have flown many airlines but Brussels Airlines is at the bottom of my scale.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-Toulouse-BRU in B Flex economy +. Both flights on time on the very old Avro 100s. Whilst glad to report that the Brussels Airlines crew still offer a fairly professional service the B Flex product is hardly attractive - a free drink and a 'snack' - a small packet of Doritos! A newspaper if you are lucky but no extra legroom. Best to buy a B light ticket and purchase drinks/food. Sadly I rarely use Brussels Airlines these days due to the unrealistic economy fares they offer on my regular routes and competition from the likes of Easyjet and Ryanair. They need to improve their product and their pricing.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-BCN return in b-light. On time departure and arrival online check-in very efficient quick drop-off luggage in BRU friendly staff and attendants. Smooth flight enough legroom drinks and snacks available for a decent price. A very good experience.

We flew from Brussels to Seville in B.Flex economy plus. Check-in in Brussels was very fast and friendly at the dedicated B.Flex counters. Service onboard was very nice. We received a breakfast with complimentary drinks. Great staff. Looking forward to try their new business class on long haul!

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-BCN return. Both legs on Airbus A319 aircraft's with the new recaro seats. Seat pitch was however much better on the outbound then the inbound where it was charter style. This is unacceptable for a national carrier. Both flights arrived ahead of schedule.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-LHR and MXP-BRU. First leg on A319 second leg on Avroliner. Both legs on time. Bus-to-aircraft used both ends at BRU as well as at MXP. Business Class has an amateur feel about it; especially on the second leg the crew were giggling like children and missed collecting hot towels. Small detail but makes an impact on how you feel about the experience. The gourmet food promised was anything but.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
NCL-BRU-AGP-BRU-NCL in b-light (discount economy). Newcastle-Brussels sectors operated by BMI regional. Check-in online 24 hours before no queue for drop off. Outbound FA fairly surly but extremely bright and cheery on return. Coffee and waffle perfectly adequate. Fairly long trek at Brussels from non-Schengen to Schengen gates although little in the way of queues. Aircraft substitution and baggage reconciliation issues meant a fairly farcical situation at gate several duplicate seat assignments added to confusion although onboard crew were extremely efficient and apologetic. Ageing 737 into Malaga not particularly comfortable. Return on newer A319 with new slimline seats and all on time. Catering on BRU-AGP sectors was BoB which was fairly expensive. Overall very good service for the price and will certainly consider using SN again.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Early-morning Geneva-Brussels flight on A319. Comfortable slim line leather seats. Efficient and professional cabin crew. One complaint only: hot beverages unavailable due to water tank left empty because of extreme freezing temperatures in Geneva.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Prague to Brussels return. Travelling as a party of 7 and got a great fare. Outbound flight on a freezing Avro RJ100 - even the FA's had to wear coats in the cold cabin until the temperature rose to an acceptable level some time after takeoff. No complimentary service in b.light but that doesn't matter on a 1.5 hr flight especially when prices for snacks/drinks are quite reasonable. Return on a RJ85 30 min delay from BRU with no explanation given. Both aircraft clean with comfortable leather seats (2+3) and decent legroom for a regional jet.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Brussels to Dakar. On the outbound flight we only learned upon entering the lounge that this flight would not be operated by Brussels but by HiFly! Leg space was poor for a six-hour flight. The crew which consisted of Brussels and HiFly was nice but couldn't really change anything. Inflight entertainment was not available. Quite surprisingly (or not) it was the same for the return. If I can avoid it I will!

### Brussels Airlines customer review
I fly BRS-BRU by Brussels Airlines (actually operated by BMI Regional) 3 or 4 times a year. The flights are good; punctuality excellent efficient online check-in comfortable seats and crew efficient. Frankly though they should be as the standard fare (BFlex) is over £600 for two one-hour flights. They claim a cheaper BLight fare exists but even booking 6 or 8 weeks in advance it never seems to be available. To add insult to injury after paying £600+ you are charged £5 to use a credit card that is just extortion. Premium fares and low-cost money grabbing tactics do not go well together.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
One of the main problems of this airline is the inconsistency of its product. The fleet has been modernized in the last two or three years but they still dispose of many ancient B737s and Avros. Seat pitch is better than with many competitors but broken seats can be found much too often. FA's sometimes are overwhelmingly friendly but as a rule they are uninterested and rude. My last flight BRU-TXL-BRU was quite typical: Outbound flight on a relatively new A319 extremely unfriendly chief purser other FA's indifferent. Inbound on an old Avro but FAs very friendly. Unusually cordial welcome (and farewell) by the Captain and we arrived half an hour early. All bets are off with this airline - expect the best and the worst.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
LHR-BRU return in B. Economy flex. On Airbus A319 and Avro RJ85. Economy flex is essentially economy class on a flexible ticket but has a few advantages. Fast track security is available at both Heathrow Terminal 1 and Brussels which is helpful at peak times. Seating is allocated with an empty middle seat if available which it was on both flights making it similar to business in that sense. Onboard there is complementary food - in the morning a rather bland cheese roll and a pain au chocolat in the afternoon it was two sandwiches and a cake. Still drinks included complementary wine and beer which is welcome. Overall reasonable for what is essentially a 50 minute flight with time built into the schedule to take into account expected delays at Heathrow. Competitively priced with BA on same route and the fully flexible Eurostar fares.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Flew Manchester to Brussels at 06.30 in economy class for business during the cold and snowy 2010 winter. I was expecting delays but check-in staff at the boarding gate had no information as to when the flight would be ready to depart. When finally on the Avro RJ85 aircraft we had to wait for the plane to be defrosted for over 45 mins and then we were put to the end of the queue for take-off. Flight attendants were ignorant and inattentive. Bad flight maybe due to the earliness of the flight and the bad weather. I do however stay loyal to Brussels Airlines due to their great brand image and other reviews.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-MAD. Booked two months in advance yet still relatively expensive compared to Iberia. Therefore expected a better onboard product which was a big mistake. No entertainment not even a newspaper food and drinks had to be paid for even for a glass of water. Staff not overly friendly but did their job. The flight departed and landed on time. Overall an okay airline but I am puzzled about their pricing strategy of maintaining full-service airline prices and delivering low cost product standards.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Dec 2011 Nairobi-Manchester via Brussels. Roomier than most airlines even in economy class but no individual inflight entertainment console just one for the whole area and no choice of movie etc. Food was good nice and hot and a good selection despite it being a diabetic meal. Breakfast was also good. Staff were friendly and helpful but check-in staff at Nairobi were not fantastic and gave me the wrong information about check-in time so I was left standing at the desk for 2 hours. These staff then turned out to be from a different airline. So far I'm happy with the service and value for money.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Geneva-Brussels. Bujumbura-Kigali. Brussels-Geneva. Brussels airlines is one of the few airlines flying these routes from Europe. Their business class product is average and given the lack of competition on these routes it is fine. The seats have seen better days not fully reclining so not the most comfortable. The entertainment system is not AVOD and not very good. The choices were limited. Catering is fine good wine selection and reasonable meals. FA's were friendly and professional. The lounges in Brussels airport are quite nice with good views on the runways plenty of light and a reasonable selection of snacks and drinks.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-BKO return - Economy. 7 hours delayed arrival due to unforeseen schedule changes. Oral apology given not really acceptable for 7 hours delay. No vouchers no miles no meal provision as a token of apology. I tried this flight option because it is the newest airline to be added to Bamako and the cheap fare is what you pay for - cheap service! No VOD old seats and apparently a day trip to Ghana and Benin on the way to Mali.

Brussels to Yaounde was diverted to Douala then to Kinshasa and only then back to Yaounde without notice. I was told a letter was handed to passengers upon boarding in Brussels however I never received one. No announcements or apologies from the crew. Arrived with a delay of 8 hours. Service was poor food was bad. Due to the diversion to Kinshasa we were served the same sandwich twice. Toilets were constantly dirty entertainment poor with main screen only bad image and poor sound system.

A wonderful flight from BCN-BRU. Aircraft A319 was clean and the cabin comfortable. The ground staff in BCN were courteous friendly and handled check-in and boarding efficiently.

Fly frequently to Africa. Service onboard and at the airport is good often very good depending on the crew. Food and beverages are excellent and I always request diabetic food. The aircraft although well maintained seems to be old. They don't provide private screens to passengers only overhead monitors with general/sometimes boring entertainment.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-TXL-BRU. Comfortable flights on full A319 in b.light economy. Very generous legroom on outbound flight (row 22). Buy-on-board catering only - reasonable prices but food not appealing. Announcements by purser very sloppy she was even mixing up languages. All male flight crew on return flight provided excellent service. Impressive and clear on-board announcements in four languages (not taped announcements). Both flights on-time. Baggage delayed in Brussels when carousel broke down for 15 minutes - no staff to be seen no announcements.

Brussels to Catania. Arrived early unpleasant check-in staff who appear obsessed with luggage weight then 2 hour delay where we were sat on the plane on a hot sunny day.

A 2.5 hr flight from Malaga to Brussels. Aircraft was a 737-400 getting rather long in the tooth nowadays the seating cramped seemed more so than the A320s and Avro regional jets SN Brussels have in their fleet. The flight departed on time with good information from the flight deck. Cabin staff appeared aloof and disinterested 2 young men at the rear of the aircraft dancing and joking about behind the closed curtain one holding a small bottle upside down and imitating a singer. Asking for a coffee seemed to be a big effort and the attendant brought it reluctantly. Service levels seem to be hit and miss.

CPH-BRU. Cabin crew went through the motion of welcoming passengers. A noisy cabin was chided by the chief purser for making noise whilst she was trying to make an announcement. When she finally made the announcement she said "we warmly welcome you". Service was the worst I have experienced in Business on European airlines.

Yaoumde to Oslo. 24 hour delay departing from Yaounde. Check in took 2 hours. Child age 3 and parent were given separate seats. No help from anyone trying to get seats together. Upon arrival in Oslo luggage was lost - including child car seat. Took 3 days to arrive. Brussels Airlines refuses to pay compensation for delay and will pay only a fraction of costs incurred as a result of being stranded with no belongings for 3 days. Will never fly this airline again.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
As the only airline operating direct flights from Europe to Bujumbura (Burundi) I have flown SN Brussels Airlines many times over the last 5 years. My experience is unpleasant because the cabin crew are unfriendly with poor customer care. No attention to passenger comfort at all. The Bujumbura Office is awful with staff who have a very bad attitude. They need to stop the low cost service at full cost prices.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
I have flown Brussels airlines short haul regularly for work over the last 3 years. The planes are old and shabby. The Avro RJ fleet that is used for most flights are particularly awful. The check-in service is ok and the flight attendants polite but the fleet is old.

As I was going from Brussels to Cotonou I feared it might be an unpleasant experience. Luckily I was mistaken. Although flights to Africa tend to be chaotic and often delayed this wasn't the case. The flight itself was very pleasant I had a very comfortable seat in Business class combined with an excellent service and great meals. I especially remember the Neuhaus-chocolates and Leonidas ice cream thoughtful little extras. On the other hand inflight entertainment was rather poor but I remain having a positive about the flight.

At Brussels airport I missed my SAS flight to Zurich via Copenhagen. SAS has NO ticket office in Brussels and since I was asked to call a number in Sweden to rebook my flight by phone (what a great service indeed) I decided to cancel the whole thing and just by a new ticket back to Switzerland. I ended up on the 7.10pm flight to Geneva in an A320 with ultra light but confortable seats - leg room was great in ECO. Also the service and the late evening snack was really nice and enjoyable not like a prepacked sandwich or a peace of chocolate.

BCN-BRU Business Class. At the check-in gate they had merged the 2 fast bag drop counters and Business Class together. This was frustrating as most people check-in online these days so I had to wait a good 10 mins despite being a Business Class customer. At the check-in the airline had moved another passenger to their seat preference which resulted in my partner and I not being sat together despite the same Business Class booking. Once on board the old B737 was rather dated and there was no separation between Business and Economy. It felt like being on a Ryanair flight with a clear view down to the back of the plane. The only sign of separation was a small label a few seats back which said B.Flex class (Economy) starts here. The seats were standard Economy in 3x3 configuration. There was no attempt to at least relocate the armrests to use up the middle seat and provide a wider seat. The legroom was decent but it still felt tight. The cabin crew were polite and attentive and made up a bit for the disappointing check-in service and seating. Arrival into Brussels was fine. Though we had to wait about 10-15 mins for out bags to arrive after the first bag appeared on the carousel. This was once again frustrating as Business Class bags should get higher priority and were labelled with this sticker in Barcelona airport. I wouldn't recommend flying with Brussels airlines in Business Class (at least on short-haul). This is clearly not an area of focus for them and would save money and fly in Economy.

CPH-BRU-CTA return on b.flex economy+. Excellent flights and consistency with the product. Great leg room free newspapers catering full bar service and attentive cabin crew and informative cockpit crew.

Brussels from Lome Togo to Brussels in Business Class. After two months I had not been credited for the miles on my MileagePlus account. After complaining to United I found out that Brussels refused to credit the miles to me saying that the flight "is not a valid route. Apparently Brussels claims that they do not fly to Lome. The flight was operated with their plane their crew. They clearly fly to Lome. They should be ejected from Star Alliance.

Brussels to Geneva A319 economy class not much legroom but the empty seat beside me was a bonus. You have to pay for food / drinks but that is the case with many other non low-cost airlines too in economy class (such as Iberia / Aer Lingus etc). Staff were pleasant enough flight landed on time. Return flight from Geneva was in a newer A320 with more leg room. Again the staff were pleasant and flight departed on time and landed ahead of schedule.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Low Cost Service at full cost prices. Brussels Airlines charge you 4 Euro for a Muffin and they are quite rude at checkin and obsessed with their baggage weights. If I would like to fly Easyjet than I also would like to pay their price. But Easyjet service at Lufthansa prices? This is ridiculous.

FCO-BRU-FCO clean refurbished 737 kind crew. Competitive fare (93 Euros return) compared to Alitalia but no snack offered and poor legroom low-cost style.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
GVA-BRU-MAN. On time service from Geneva short 1h flight with nothing distinguishing. Pleasant FA's. Disappointed by the lack of onboard service considering it is not a low cost carrier and fare wasn't cheapest. Departure from Brussels slightly early on empty Avro RJ plane quick and easy arrival into Manchester. Overall an average experience.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
CPH-BRU-Bujumbura. Excellent trip lots of space. Long haul new aircraft quite noisy cabin clean staff professional a bit rigid and no smile were noticed. Servings fairly frequent enough drinks. Serve even a good sparkling wine on economy class but only on day-flights. Food exceptionally good special request met to perfection. Good information from captain. Economy flex tickets do not provide additional benefits on board - there is just one monkey class on the long haul. Airline seems now to have finally decided to become a full service carrier and have dropped discount modality.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
CPH-BRU-AGP in b.flex economy+. CPH-BRU excellent leg space and inflight meal complimentary bar service. BRU-AGP on B737-400 very tired interior but warm meal with full bar service.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Brussels-Vilnius return clean Avro with decent seating. Flew B-Flex this time and offered a nice warm meal. Crew professional and language skills excellent. On Brussels Airlines you get what you pay for: B-Flex offers economy class with some extra perks (fast lane) B-Light are the cheaper fares. In B-Light you can buy drinks and snacks on board.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Brussels-Porto. B-light economy ticket for 100 euro return. Online check-in crashed but I got my seat (emergency exit). The plane was half-empty so nobody on seats next to me. Good flight but pity you have to pay extra for food or drinks. Strangely enough my Etihad Guest card was not accepted.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
The flight to Zurich costs over €1200 in economy - a destination once served by Virgin Express for less than €100 return! This disgrace compounded with the fact that the Brussels Airlines plane is a very cramped old dirty plane!

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-TLV. Service ok plane on time but Brussels Airlines operates A319 on this route. This is a very cramped plane seat with small pitch and hard cushion. Almost impossible to sleep on this night flight. Business seat is a joke - at least fare was competitive.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Brussels to Philadelphia on Christmas eve or at least we tried. Brussels Airlines was supposed to get us to London so we could get our connection with US Airways. Due to weather conditions flight got cancelled. I am not complaining about the cancellation weather conditions are beyond anyone's control however I am complaining about the lack of information and help given to us from this point on. We were rebooked re-cancelled they lost our luggage on the way and there is no way to get through to their luggage tracing department they just do not answer any calls! When you send an email to their Baggage department you do not get an answer either let alone an automated message saying they received your mail! It does not stop there. Brussels Airlines changed my return flight to London with US Airways without consulting me and decided to change it to return to Brussels even though I live in London. I still to this day do not know why! They had to add a flight to my itinerary so I could get home to London. To this day I still do not have my luggage and have not been contacted once. My emails and calls remain unanswered. I have never had to face such problems in all my previous travels with any airlines.

Brussels to Bilbao on 25 December. No delays were indicated on the website nor at check-in. But when departure time arrived things got wrong. A 1 hour delay was announced. After a while change of gate and an airplane was there but no crew! On Xmas day there was not much traffic and runways were active. Some passenger had been going to the airport for the 3rd consecutive day due to cancellation linked to snow. A new 1 hour delay was announced with no clear indication that the flight would leave. There were children old people and a pregnant woman. We had to pressure and harrass the airline agents to get food vouchers as legislation provides for. Eventually we left with a 3 hour delay. Information was non0-existant. Flying with Brussels Airlines is a poor experience.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
MXP-BRU. Very average at best. We were 45 minutes late leaving due to weather (ice) at MXP and will give them credit for the updates. Of course all had connections and this created havoc on the plane with questions from many passengers. Will say the Purser handled this with dignity and answered all with a good attitude. Surprised at the amount and size of carry on baggage that was allowed. This was a smaller plane and noticed many oversized pieces that were not able to fit any where. Many people had piled their pieces on empty seats and left them there. Nothing said by crew. No inflight service at all in my section. They did get me there and transferred my luggage so happy about that.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
LHR-Bujumbura. Overall a very poor experience. Service and facilities on the ground in Brussels were very poor. I had to queue at the Brussels Airlines desk for an hour to get a boarding card whilst the sole employee dealt very slowly with the 2 or 3 people in front of me. On the flight seats were uncomfortable with limited leg room and very little recline. The inflight entertainment was near non-existent - at least the screen was so far away that it was impossible to watch. Food was average.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-LFW/ACC-BRU. Mixed experience overall and not up to what I would expect. Online check-in did not work for either leg. Boarding in Brussels well organized in Accra was complete chaos with the airport trying to board three different flights through the same gate at roughly the same time. No information screens or announcements people milling around and gate agents shouting instructions but only managing to add to the confusion. The aircraft interiors were old with no PTVs and just a single screen at the front of each cabin. The food on the flight to Lome was horrible - worse than US-based airlines. The food on the flight back to Brussels was much better. Cabin crew were also variable with a few trying hard while others were disengaged and uninterested. But since the fare was the cheapest by far I got good value for my money overall.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Business Class seats are very average no flat bed position and not very comfortable if you happen to be tall. During our outward bound flight my seat (03C) malfunctioned and became immovable. I brought this to the attention of the crew and without apology was rudely informed that I should choose another vacant seat for the remainder of the flight. I found this unacceptable as there were no free seats accessible for myself and my wife to sit together. Eventually after complaining once more a member of the crew was able to correct the problem by resetting the mechanical unit under the chair. I would also add that the screen in front of my seat was also faulty cabin was dirty and the quality of the food was well below Business Class standard. On our return flight to Kigali before taking off we noticed that both our seats were malfunctioning and once again advised the flight crew. A member of the ground technical staff was called on board and together with the cabin crew attempted to repair the seats without success. At this stage we were politely asked if we would mind moving to the free seats one row behind. We complied with the request only to find that these seats (4A & 4C) were likewise not operational and were finally relocated to 4H & 4K. The crew on this flight were attentive apologetic and informed us that the problems with seats in Business Class are recurrent and assured us that a report would be filed. I personally bore the expense of upgrading our tickets to Business Class in order to enjoy a more comfortable and relaxed journey. Unfortunately this was not the case as we were troubled by the overall poor condition of the aircraft cabin and casual disregard for the comfort and safety of passengers by Brussels Airlines.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Even though I had a low-cost ticket I enjoyed nice service in the old Sabena style on a flight BRU-Nice in A319. I was lucky to book two exit-row seats using online check in so plenty of space. Did not use the meal or drink service. Four stars not five.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
B-Flex (the Premium Eco) can be a good deal but be very careful never to take a codeshare flight. I did it with a flight to Lisbon using TAP and I must say that the website of Brussels Airlines is very misleading you would need a magnifier to note that this is a codeshare flight. As a consequence you are denied any of the B-Flex perks: staff at Brussels Airlines check-in does not even recognize you and send you to make the full queue at TAP check-in. You receive no fast track at the security. You receive no preferred seating no snack not even a drink. You are basically a simple economy passenger stupid enough to have paid a B-Flex fee instead of the cheapest economy fare. I got the Brussels Airlines flight on my return and then had nothing to complain I received all the perks and was quite happy of the flight. In my view the Brussels Airlines website is totally dishonest as even their confirmation told me about those perks I was not going to receive on the TAP flight.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Flew NCE-BRU and BRU-NCE b economy flex. Good onboard service with free coffee drinks and snacks Brussels Airport convenient and easy to use. All this with a low ticket price. A good choice also if you want to connect to Africa cheaply.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRS-BRU return (twice). These flights are operated by bmi aircraft and crews. All flights on time or a little early. Embraer aircraft are a fairly small but I like them particularly if they are not full (only one of these four flights was nearly full); they are light smooth and the leg room is fine for a short flight. My one complaint is the price one of my trips was economy (B.Light) and the other economy plus (B.Light+). Although the latter was over twice the price (and even economy is not particularly cheap) there was virtually no difference in the quality of service - a bit more food and that is it. I believe the hand luggage weight limit is a bit higher but if you check-in online nobody knows. So my advice is buy the cheapest ticket; though as previous commentators have said that is not always possible.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-NCL-BRU in 'b.light economy'. Booked tickets through their website and as usual the cheaper fares were sold out so ended up booking a rather expensive ticket. I used the online check in to Newcastle but when trying to check in online for the return flight to Brussels I got a message 'pick up boarding pass at airport' meaning I had to be even more early at Newcastle airport for the 6.25 morning flight. A positive point is flights between Brussels and Newcastle are operated for Brussels Airlines by BMI who fly Embraers on the route. These may not be the most comfortable planes but a lot better than the outdated AVRO's Brussels Airlines used for this route.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Travelled two days ago with an elderly disabled friend from Oslo to Brussels. The plane was twenty minutes late taking off - which was worrying as we had a short time connecting flight to catch in Brussels. To be fair Brussels Airlines put us in a car and dropped us "near" - their words - to the security check in. In reality it took twenty minutes to navigate through the confusing Brussels Airport and the extremely arrogant Belgian security staff. We just made our connecting flight in time. My disabled companion was extremely stressed and needed his heart medicine more than once.

Brussels to Entebbe via Kigali in business class. Seats standard business no possibility to lie flat and primitive video system (no VOD). Service excellent attentive sufficient number of attendants food extremely good. Wine list small but high quality wines in all a very nice trip.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-LHR.Checked in online and walked straight to the gate. The bus driver didn't seem to know where the RJ100 was parked and drove us around almost every corner of the airport. The suitcase (even though it is within cabin luggage size limits) does not fit in the AVRO overhead lockers. Typically FA's place it in the front of the plane and hand it over when leaving the aircraft. Last week the flight to LHR was delayed by more than one hour There was no food no coffee no tea due to a strike at the catering company. When leaving the aircraft I asked for my luggage and was told to get it on the conveyor. After passing the IRIS scan instead of passport control (which is a real time saver in London) I could wait for over 30 minutes to receive my cabin luggage back. Usually SN Brussels Airlines has a very good staff and service but this time a was slightly disappointed.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
NCL-BRU in Economy Flex. The small embraer plane is operated by BMI Regional. Very punctual service only one cabin crew each way but they were excellent. The food was good. My only gripe was that I wished I'd flown Economy and saved money. The seat is exactly the same as is the leg oom. In reality the extra money (which was considerable) is really for a newspaper a couple of drinks and a cold meal. If you are on a flight for less than two hours then I would recommend economy.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
CPHBRU-BRS return in economy classflights on time. Cabin staff very service minded and helpful. Seat pitch more than adequate. Even though I had to pay for drinks and snacks the prices were OK food fresh and a good selection of Belgian beer. There's also diabtec friendly food and a vegetarian option. Only moment of irritation was transfer at BRU which when transferring from Schengen to Non-Schengen requires at least 25 mins of walking.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
ATH to BRU in B-flex. ot stuck in ATH with so many others due to the volcano eruption - very well taken care of. Brussels Airlines arranged accomodation for us very well informed and promptly rebooked and sent home as soon as operations resumed. Very nice cabin crews in both directions.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
MAD-BRU-NBO return with my Miles & More miles. Short haul flights on old 737s but cabins were clean and decent. We were on b-flex economy so were offered a meal which was nice. Long haul on A330-300 with nice pitch but no IFE which would have made a big difference and ok meals. Cabin crews very good except for NBO-BRU where more veteran FAs not so nice. Overall a reliable airline with acceptable service.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Brussels to Berlin in b-light and back in b-flex. Clean and comfortable Avro's with good legroom and wide seats (only 5 seats in a row). Crew friendly and with good language skills. Food in b-flex nothing to write home about but drinks of good quality and plentifull. Check- in in Brussels quick and easy thanks to my silver status with Miles and More. Completely other story at check-in in Berlin. One attendant only arrived two hours before departure and as there was only one row nobody cared about priority check-in for premium passengers. Unacceptable.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-GVA-BRU in b.light. Outbound flight on nearly full Avro RJ 100. Only two FA's but very friendly service. Flight arrived on time. Return flight on ageing B737-300. Departure delayed due to late arrival of aircraft and further delays due to heavy traffic at GVA. Arrived in BRU one hour late. Only three FA's on this full evening flight very poor service. Maybe not if you were in business or b.flex (one third of all passengers). Sales of drinks and snacks in b.light by just one FA (what were the others up to?) started just two minutes before descent into BRU. Very rushed service as a result. Service in general mostly non-existant unfriendly and disinterested. Simply not good enough given the fact the return fare was EUR 250. Taped announcements very annoying. Live announcements in Dutch virtually incomprehensible.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
I fly regularly between Porto and Gothenburg via Brussels with Brussels Airlines. The time table suits me the way you are treated is very good cabins are clean and comfortable and as far as service is concerned you get what you pay for. And the prices are very good compared with other options I have.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Problem of Brussels Airline is that they have to decide if they are a low cost or a standard airline. Low cost prices are not so low but if you are travelling at full price you are served like a low cost airline this applies in particular for ground services in the airport: long queues bad info personnel not trained to handle unexpected events such delays or cancellations and very few people at the help desks. Before from Brussels there was the choice between SN Brussels and Virgin Express both company were delivering good value for money - when they merged together they took the worst of both airlines and put it on the same plane!

### Brussels Airlines customer review
The biggest problem of Brussels Airlines is that in a mostly small Avroliner cabin three classes are done. Passengers in business do not even have the privacy of a curtain. In business a very cheap champagne is offered. The meal service in so called B flex is usually rather poor - a company that started very good after the Sabena disaster as SN Brussels even offering hot croissants in economy now approach the level of a cheap carrier.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
GVA-BRU-GVA on Brussels Airlines in B.Flex cabin. Airplane old 737-400 going to BRU and a B737-300 on the way back. Airplanes were showing their age but are ok. Seat pitch was ok in B.Flex class. Service was very good with a good snack full beverage service. Cabin crew were nice and multiligual. B.Flex product is very good - almost the same level as some other airlines business class. You can't access lounge for free but you are allowed to use fast lane at security at Brussels which is very good.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Had a B-Flex with Brussels Airlines. Plane was delayed 5 Hours because of snowfall in Sweden so we missed our connection flight. Our onward ticket with a 5-star airline got rebooked to a low cost airline (economy) with non-existent service. Also we had to pay for hotel 1 night in Brussels that Brussels Airline refused to pay. I cannot recommend this airline to anyone.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
My wife and two kids left from Kinshasa to Toulouse via Brussels. The plane had three hours delay on arrival in Brussels and they missed the connecting flight. The next flights were full one was cancelled the last flight at night again did not take off. They refused hotel or any support claiming always there would soon be a flight. They slept on the floor in the airport. The next day same story no assistance no help - flights leaving to Toulouse booked out. She left finally at 6pm a delay of 36 hours in which no assistance or help whatsoever was given to them. Brussels should be ashamed their service is non existent.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
BRU-OSL in economy class. Check in on-line and printed my boarding pass before arrival at the airport. Luggage drop off at a designated counter was quick and hustle free. Flight was on time. Staff friendly and helpful. Food available for purchase on board. Overall experience was quite positive except for a loud noise made by an old Avro RJ100 engines during the entire flight. If booked in advanced fares are normally affordable.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
LIS-BRU. Brussels airlines is downgrading its product which is becoming low cost with old and tired 737s from former Virgin express with very cramped seats and one of the worse pitch. Inbound flight with TAP and you could size difference for seat comfort and overall package. Will try avoiding this company when possible until fleet is upgraded and they become more competitive. .

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Brussels-Venice return. Worth noting that in theory BLight pax have less cabin baggage allowance than BFLEX and only the overhead lockers down to row 4/5 are large enough to hold a standard carry-on suitcase. So get on early and grab one of these lockers! Online check-in is a real bonus when flying at the crack of dawn. It meant I could take the first airport bus arriving at 05.35 go straight to security and arrive at gate A71 (somewhere near Mechelen) before loading started.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Tel Aviv to Brussels and on to Barcelona and back. All flights were on time - three on A319s and the other an Avro. Service polite friendly and efficient. Meals and refreshments were free and fine on longer legs. No videos or music was available. Price was keenest of all airlines on the dates travelled. All in all a good package with nothing meaningful to complain about.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
CPH-BRU-CTA return in b.business. Champagne on boarding Cold meal CPH-BRU-CPH - and warm lunch BRU-CTA-BRU. Huge difference between service and attitude of crew which gave me an inconsistent impression. Satisfying experience - food was really good.

### Brussels Airlines customer review
Brussels to Budapest B-Flex: seems the additional cost of B-Flex compared to B-Light is worth when you fly on a B737 as you have a probability to get the seat next to you free. However if you fly the Avro the flight is almost always full and you are in exactly the same cramped seats and suffer lack of hand luggage storage space like B-Light - so you pay much money for the privilege of a regular food tray and apple juice. I had to fly with my handbag under my feet and it was far from comfortable. SN Airlines is basically a no frills airline but to be fair they have good schedules and are timely.
