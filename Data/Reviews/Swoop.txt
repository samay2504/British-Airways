### "a cheap flight and not much more to be expected"
Not Verified |  Not a long flight, our row was ignored every time for some reason when passed by for food, drink, and garbage? I specifically booked a window seat because I'm neurodivergent and have trouble feeling safe if I'm not stuck up against the plane wall, or simply put, for comfortability so I always make sure to grab a window seat on any flight I've taken. Initially I was seated wrong due to my own mishap and I simply moved to the row in front of me, I had a window seat booked on this flight as previously mentioned and was assuming the elderly woman in my spot would get up to allow me in because it's simply not her spot, she did not, so I said something along the lines of "excuse me, sorry to bother but this is my seat" to which she just stared at me, a flight attendant was beside me and told me "can you please just sit down in the middle, she's already taken that seat" I'm not one for confrontation so I just said "I guess so" and took my spot in the middle mind you the elderly woman's patting the middle seat gesturing for me to sit down while I'm getting situated which I found inappropriate, she stared at my screen quite frequently through the flight which made me uncomfortable, and then started pushing up against me to get me to move (everyone else was stationed still waiting for conformation to move) when waiting to exit the plane. I am in no means wanting to disrespect any of the elderly community but I'm tired of older people treating everyone younger than them rudely just because they're older, I will not respect you until you respect me. I paid for a window seat and I expect a window seat, let alone the lack of guidance from the flight attendant. Alas it's a cheap flight and there's not much more to be expected.

### "don’t want to refund my money"
My flight was cancelled a few hours prior to departure, then I had to book a similar flight with another airline. Two hours later Swoop send an email apologizing and telling us the flight was ok now. I ended up with two no refundable flights. They did not provide any support, was impossible to talk to customer service, no phone number to call was available. They don’t want to refund my money.

### "won't give you any compensation"
Not Verified |  Arrived at Hamilton airport September 9th to find out that our flight had been cancelled. We were told that we would receive an email with our options. One being a flight out of Toronto or a refund. I waited for almost 2 hours for the email which finally appeared in my "JUNK MAIL". I had previously received emails from Swoop which did not go into my junk mail. I went to book the flight with WestJet out of Toronto for that same afternoon and the flight was fully booked. The next option for me was for a refund. I chose the refund. Now, I paid an uber driver to drive us to the airport, then had to have my nephew pick us up to take us back home. Now we had a week booked off for our vacation and my husband and I both lost a weeks pay for nothing! My sister was upset because now we couldn't go see her. Very unreliable and won't give you any compensation.

### "Such a horrible service"
Never fly with Swoop ! There's no counter person at the airport. Didn't do online checkin thinking one hour prior showup would work as they mentioned in the website. When we continuously trying to find the counter person, flair and PAL counter people also joined to search the counter person. Rang the bell infront of counter continuously. Then the boarding was closed finally. We missed the flight. Nobody was responsible. I have the evidence to show that I came 45 minutes before to the counter because I got a long term parking ticket for my vehicle from the airport. In that the time was there. I booked four tickets. Swoop didn't even respond to my emails. Had to rebook. Such a horrible service.

### "never be flying with Swoop again"
Not Verified |  I will never be flying with Swoop again. They cancelled our flight and promised to reimburse food, taxis, and hotel stays. They are not following through with their promises and the customer service is terrible. I would never recommend swoop as if you have any issues with your flight they are of no help and will just ignore you and not follow through on promises made for reimbursement. Pay the extra and and fly with literally anybody else.

### "all very dirty. Disgusting"
I was perfectly fine with no skin problems when I boarded the plane. After a four hour flight I got off the plane with six extremely itchy bug bites on the back of my right thigh, one on my right hip, and one on the back of my right arm. Fleas? I don't know what kind of bug it was but the seats, arm rests, trays, floor, etc. were all very dirty. Disgusting! I'm just glad I didn't rest my head back!

### "I would fly with them again"
I had read many bad review with Swoop so I booked with an open mind primarily because of the low cost of flying with a family of 8. We had a 15 month old with us and had her gear in tow (car seat and stroller) we were told it would be easier to gate check the baby equipment. Right from our first interaction with the staff they were very accommodating with our situation and the stewardesses were phenomenal in explaining the safety protocol with a baby. Our outgoing flight was smooth and no issues, our return flight was delayed 40 mins because of weather but we were given ample notice. Once we were cleared to board we were delighted to see the same staff who recognized us and came over to say HI!! It's a shame that Swoop will be no longer. I would fly with them again.

### "fly Swoop while you can before it shuts down"
Not Verified |  If you're on a budget going on a trip to Jamaica, fly Swoop while you can before it shuts down! I don't know what a flight is like going to other locations but flying to Sangster airport in Jamaica was perfectly fine. It was $550 after tax roundtrip for a 4 hr flight. I know there a ton of negative reviews about Swoop but perhaps that's dependent on location? It's a low cost flight so YES everything is going to cost you, but you can't fault them for that. You have the choice to pick who you fly with. The flight attendants were nice, seats were actually very spacious. The only unfortunate thing is that our return flight was cancelled but that wasn't even Swoop's fault (the airport was doing construction). Ended up being a blessing in disguise. Swoop covered a free stay in Montego Bay since we had to wait for following day to fly out. It was pretty seamless to be honest. I don't know why some other passengers didn't have it sorted (maybe they didn't book through swoop), but I got the email for a complimentary accommodation and they gave me 3 options. I picked the 1 that's a 10 minute drive from airport and it was perfect!. The hotel manager was there waiting for us and everything worked out great; we had booking # and she checked us in. It was awesome, another day in Jamaica I couldn't complain. The return flight next day was fine. I'd def fly with Swoop again.

### "No communication from the flight staff"
Not Verified |  First of all, our flight got cancelled. The only options to rebook given was Hamilton to Calgary and Calgary to Victoria. I am not sure why we were given a ring around flight as I have 2 small children with me. But after waiting on line for so long I was told that was my only option or I have to rebook with another airline at my costs. This was a long weekend so obviously all local flights were up like 120%. No choice to get home we took the flight. With little windows of opportunity to connect, guess what? The flight from Hamilton sat on the run way for 35 mins making us miss the connecting flight. No communication from the flight staff as to what is happening at all. Once landed we found out that the Calgary flight decided to leave 10 mins earlier. Appalling and disgusted, now I have to stand in a long line ready to argue with the agent on the issue as now I have no idea where my luggage is. How is it that Calgary has daily multiple flights to Edmonton but we need to go to Victoria and then to Edmonton? What century are we in? Finally we were able to get a direct flight from Calgary to Edmonton but had only 20 mins to board. I had to run as fast as I could with 2 young children minutes before the gate closed. What a horrible horrible disgusting experience.

### "won't pay me for booking another flight"
Not Verified |  I flew to Ontario from Edmonton and was supposed to be a return when I got to the airport to go back to Edmonton the security told me that the airline cancelled the flight, there was no one there at Swoop to talk to so we could make arrangements to book another flight, so I had to book another flight with another airline. Now Swoop won't pay me for booking another flight. There is nothing cheap about this service, never did I hear that you have to pay for your seat and all your luggage. They are trying to tell me they left 3 hours after they cancelled their flight, how could I have knowing that when no one was there to talk to.

### "Swoop cancelled our flight"
After a delay, right when we were about to board, Swoop cancelled our flight and rescheduled for 7am the next day. We were stranded in Abbotsford and they offered us hotels in the US or one in Chilliwack (30 mins away). I decided to take my toddler home (1 hour away) using Uber and leave my house at 4:30am the next morning to go back. Swoop is refusing to cover my Uber/Taxi rides because apparently they only pay for transportation to the hotels they offered. They single-handedly ruined my trip. The domino effect this had on my trip wouldn’t fit in this box. This airline is a joke and no one should ever fly with them.

### "they have no customer service"
Not Verified |  Right after booking my flight with Swoop I learned the airline was going out of business and couldn’t confirm I would reach my destination in time. For weeks I tried to contact them to cancel my flight but they have no customer service, The messaging and robots was not successful. It is a blessing that this atrocious airline is folding.

### "Terrible customer service"
The very worst. Terrible customer service. Terrible attendants, and to think they call the 400$ ticket (excluding baggage) to Moncton from Hamilton low-fare? I got to check in 43mins instead of 45 minutes before departure and the ladies at the check in said since it was my fault that I was 2 mins difference, I wouldn't get checked in, nor get a refund, nor get issued another ticket. It was their non empathy and gross disregard that is very appalling. I still had 43 mins to get on the flight, but they insisted there was nothing they could help me with.

### "cancelled our flight in air"
On Thursday May 18 I started on my journey with my daughter to meet my grandchildren. We were able to go because Swoop had a big sale. We were in the air on our way pilot came on said they had to turn around the pilot strike was the next day they cancelled our flight in air. Never booked another one - no customer service only option was to book a flight out of Toronto the next day for more than double what I paid. I had to request a refund on the cancelled flight to pay for the next one. I asked for the difference being 700$ more I asked for 500$ Swoop dollars so I could make up the valuable 1.5 days I lost. They told me because I needed to have that money that's letting them off the hook to do anything for me! They're disgusting

### "it was a great experience"
Not Verified |  I recently flew Swoop from Abbotsford to Edmonton and back last week and it was a great experience! First time flying with them and I was very happy with the super friendly gate and flight staffs both ways. Plus, both flights were on time and we even landed a little early each way. A 180 degree difference from my last 2 flying experiences in the US!

### "ignored any of our communications"
Swoop changed automatically our return flight to earlier days and placed $452 CAD charges on our credit cards. While reaching out to them we faced only a Bot called Donna as their customer support and eventually, after days of research could get a hold of robotic human support named JB on Facebook Messenger who was extremely ruthless, rude, and very heartless. We mentioned we have an appointment with a doctor on later dates for our 1 yr old son and must stay here as a pregnant mom along with my nanny and husband to visit our doctor. They only rejected us with a phrase asking to pay again $452 CAD to change the dates back. Finally, to make the matters worse, they asked us to stop chatting with them based on their terms and services and then to our shock totally disabled our ability to even make any new changes to our flight to be returned back to the original date even when we accepted to pay for it again. Despite mentioning we have to deal with a brain tumor of a kid and it is an urgent trip which was planned precisely with doctors, they ignored any of our communications on their Facebook messenger (only channel). There is no phone to call and nothing else to work with to get a hold of anyone. We asked for their managers and their support said I am the only boss here and you have no one else to talk with whatsoever.

### "deeply dissatisfied and frustrated"
My recent encounter with Swoop airline left me deeply dissatisfied and frustrated. My family and I had booked flights from Toronto to Punta Cana, departing on June 10th and returning on June 25th. However, only three days into our trip, I received an email notifying me of a change in my return ticket to June 17th, accompanied by an unexpected charge of $452 CAD. This sudden alteration and additional fee were shocking and unwelcome. What aggravated the situation further was the lack of accessible communication channels with Swoop. Their customer support offered no direct phone line, leaving me with no choice but to navigate through their automated bot, Donna, for hours on end. Finally, I managed to connect with a human representative via Facebook Messenger, only to be met with rudeness and a robotic demeanor. This stark contrast to the helpfulness of automated systems made me yearn for the efficiency of bots once again. Regrettably, despite my efforts to address the issue, the Swoop customer support team failed to provide any satisfactory solutions. Their suggested resolution was to pay an additional $450 to revert the return date back to June 25th. This lack of accountability and refusal to rectify the problem only added to my disbelief that an airline in Canada could conduct business in such an unethical manner. In conclusion, my experience with Swoop airline was extremely disappointing, with their practices falling far below the standard of professionalism and customer care expected from a reputable carrier. I caution fellow travelers to carefully consider the potential risks before booking with Swoop, as their questionable practices and unhelpful customer support may lead to significant inconveniences and financial burdens.

### "also lost one day of work"
Not Verified |  On Friday May 19th the flight 0638 departure time 3:20PM from Toronto got cancelled and we got notified by e-mail at noon time on that day which was not enough notice to rearrange our plane as we already went to the airport. We also lost one day of work as we could have gone to work that day.

### "Still waiting for response"
Still waiting for response to request for refund after 4 Months. I paid for an extra leg length seat but when I got on aircraft the seat was no different than the standard seat. The flight attendant recommended I ask Swoop for a refund. I paid to check baggage on my outbound and return flights. My return flight was cancelled and when I re-booked the return flight I paid again to check a bag. I requested a refund at the end of January. I'm still waiting.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Avoid at all costs! The customer service is absolutely terrible. Companies like Swoop are the reason travel has become so stressful. They lie and scam. I was midway through my flight when they had mechanical issues on board and returned to the original airport. They had absolutely no other flight options to get my to my destination within the next 72 hours. You can't call and speak to anyone and we were told at the airport to just go home by Swoop employees. We were told we got flight and hotel coverage with emails to prove and now swoop won't reimburse. They also couldn't do anything about my return flight that was impossible to take because they never got me to my destination. Have never had such a bad experience with an airline.

### "The worst customer service"
The worst customer service and only automated responses. I made an error in booking last week in distress and immediately tried to rectify this (wrong airport code). Was told Swoop would not assist as once booked, regardless of the situation they will not assist under any circumstance. I just wanted to change the destination (Airport Code which was similar to the incorrect one I accidentally entered). They told me I would have to rebook a new flight. So I had to eat $550+ and rebook which I did on another airline. I am a frequent flyer and this was my first encounter with SWOOP! Will never recommend!

### "Staff was very nice"
It all went smooth. The price was 1/3 of the major airlines. We added nothing extra. Our personal item, just a little smaller than a regular carry on was free and we were seated together. Easy boarding, they do tag carry on bags to ensure you paid the extra for them. We took two flights, a return journey, both left on time and arrived early. Staff was very nice. They did what they were supposed to take you on time to your destination as an economy air carrier.

### "one of the most unreliable airlines out there"
Swoop is one of the most unreliable airlines out there. I am a travel agent and have sold WestJet vacations packages that include Swoop flights. Most of them were cancelled and no help offered to my clients. I am now sitting in Pearson airport with about 5 gate change emails then a 2 hour delay email. They offer you meal vouchers but you go to the swoop agents and they pass you off to someone else so not one swoop agent would actually produce these meal vouchers as per my email. I do not recommend anyone use this airline if you don’t want to deal with major delays and or cancellations. The only positive I have is the staff on board flights are amazing, funny and extremely friendly.

### "disgusted, outraged, exhausted"
Not Verified | We tried to fly out of Varadero, Cuba yesterday to Vancouver through Toronto but you had 6 hourly delays resulting in us having to sleep in their airport and not leaving until 10 hours later. Because of this we missed our connecting flight from Toronto to Vancouver. In Varadero, we had no food or water and my pregnant wife was forced to stay awake all night. We are absolutely disgusted, outraged, exhausted.

### "Swoop has the worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Swoop has the worst customer service. There absolutely no one to contact if you are having trouble signing into your Swoop account as you need to be signed in to your account to access customer service! Also, when you try to reset your password the temporary password always includes an o or a 0. So you have to try it several ways to figure out if it’s a number or a letter and the passcode is case sensitive so then you have to try lower case and upper case. In the end it just doesn’t work. I asked at the Swoop counter when checking in for our flight if there is a customer service number I can call for any assistance and I was told there is not. We fly to Florida often and have family across Canada. We will be using other airlines until Swoop can figure out their customer service issue.

### "I am shocked by poorly this has been handled"
I wish that I had paid attention to the bad reviews. We travel frequently, and this was our first experience flying with Swoop. I have flown with WestJet (WestJet owns Swoop, same company) and I always had positive travels with them. I will never fly with WestJet again, I will never fly Swoop, and I will never recommend this airline to anyone - professionally or personally. They bumped us, lied to us and refuse to acknowledge their responsibility for $400+ they owe us. The ‘discount’ airlines have lots of hidden fees and if, as in our case, things go terribly wrong Swoop will hide in legislative ‘loopholes’ and do everything except the right thing - which is pay what you owe to a passenger. We are 7 weeks post-trip now, and after multiple weeks of waiting, and multiple condescending correspondence’s, we remain without the money. I am shocked by poorly this has been handled. Avoid SWOOP, there’s so many better choices!

### "we will never fly with Swoop again"
Worst managed, organized, and most frustrating check-in service ever! We arrived at the Toronto airport 3 hours prior to our flight as required by the airline for international departures. We were on a direct flight heading to Las Vegas. We had a few people ahead of us and there were four reps at the check-in counters when we arrived. We waited in line for over 1 hour as the Swoop check-in reps called people heading to 3 other destinations, Montego, Halifax, Kalona, ahead of us as apparently their flights were on last calls. Why there weren't separate lines set up for these 4 flights, how could there be so many people, and all 3 flights where on last call was beyond everyone's understanding who were there on time for the Vegas flight. Instead people who decided it wasn't important to be at the airport on time for their flight where called ahead of those who followed the rules and to add insult to injury we had to wait longer in line because we followed the rules. To make it even better, it was at this point that the check-in reps decided it was time to leave and we were down to one rep for a significant amount of time while the line kept growing behind us. So what this tells us is that the airline has no consideration or respect for customers who comply with their regulations. Truthfully you're further ahead to not inconvenience yourself show up whenever you want, you'll be treated better. The final topper was when our luggage was finally checked-in we had to haul it all the way down to US customs at the other end of the airport. Nice! Thanks Swoop! FYI, we will never fly with Swoop again and don't recommend it either, unless of course you're one of those entitled stragglers that feels the world revolves around you, then Swoop is the perfect airline for you. They bend backwards to accommodate you. Wonder if there's enough of you to keep Swoop in business?? !

### "Worst flight we've ever had"
Worst flight we've ever had! We (my senior citizen mother, my husband and I and our 5 year old daughter flew from Toronto to Las Vegas on April 3, 2023. We asked for seats together with our 5year old daughter but all of us were scattered. Worst was my daughter was put to Seat “20F” alone. Us adults were put at 30C/31C/31F. This is the most stupid thing we’ve ever seen.

### "Extremely disappointed"
The flight was supposed to depart at 11:10 am but it delayed 3 times and finally departed at 1:46 pm. I wish to get some sort of compensation from the airline because such carelessness are not appreciated. This airline is meant to be cheap but honestly it was not as cheap either. A one way ticket from Edmonton to Abbotsford cost me 119 dollars. Whereas I have taken flights with other airlines before which could give me a round trip in less than that price. Extremely disappointed.

### "The staff were wonderful"
Not Verified |  I flew to Victoria on March 19th returning on April9th. The staff were wonderful. They met me with a smile, were professional and I got the impression that they enjoyed their job. It was a stress-free trip both ways and I really appreciated all their efforts. I will most definitely fly Swoop in the future.

### "never fly with Swoop again"
I am type 1 diabetic. An hour into my flight I had a very bad low that was crashing. I had eaten my own snack but that did not suffice. I asked an attendant if she could get me a glass of apple or orange juice and she proceeds to tell me most people carry their own snacks, I explained to her I did and it's still crashing, I just need sugar. She said she could get me water. I had to tell her again I need sugar not water. Eventually another attendant comes and gives me 4 squares of chocolate. I was never checked on or asked if I needed anything else. I will never fly with Swoop again.

### "No more Swoop for me"
As usual, Swoop can't count. Its either a mad rush to check in at the gate with no controls or, today they loaded the complete plane and the last people on were Zone 1. I choose Zone 1 and pay extra for it because of a handicap. I don't need to load first as I don't want to take away from people worse off then me. I thought if I paid for zone 1 I would be okay. Get training for the imbeciles at the gate! No more Swoop for me

### "Communication is non existent"
Our flight was delayed by approximately 4 hours. I have tried to contact them to be compensated for this and I have heard nothing back from them. They had already delayed the flight by almost an hour 4 hours prior to departure time and then delayed it again shortly before that departure time. By the time we left people had been waiting so long that some were escorted off the flight for inebriation. Communication is non existent. I realize it’s a budget airline but this is unacceptable

### "Such terrible customer service"
It has been over 30 days since Swoop lost my luggage. I filed a report at the airport, sent multiple emails, tried calling their customer service (which is just an automated voice that tells you to email them then hangs up the call) and there is still no response. Such terrible customer service. This was my first flight with Swoop and I will never make that mistake again. It is a scam of an airline and needs to be shutdown

### "we will never ever fly Swoop"
Not Verified |  When I thought that I had a bad experience with Sunwings there comes Swoop. We started our vacation on 13 Mar 2023 flight WO0638 to Cancun. We waited after we boarded more than one hour on board without knowing why we don't take off. It is true that the captain made an announcement , but in so low voice that was hard to understand. Asking the flight attendant why we don't proceed to take off she was annoyed, I guess, and said that the captain already mentioned that. I did not understand neither did my wife. Finally we got to Cancun late more than one hour but they ran out of Mexican immigration forms and we had to figure it out at our time expense, adding more time to be late in the resort. No complimentary anything was handed to us to compensate a bit all of this inconvenience. Now comes the part when we return from Cancun, 18 Mar 2023. Getting to the airport we noticed that our flight 641 has been delayed for more than 5 hours let alone the line up time for checking in. Please note that no email has been sent to us to let us know the flight is delayed. Then when we've got to the check in counter and we started to ask questions one of clerks took us on a side and issued us vouchers for the 3 of us worth 60$. and we were told to check in around 21:00 since the flight was delayed till after midnight. But no plausible explanation has been given to us. Checked out the hotel at noon, got to the airport around 16:00 the flight was at 20 minutes past midnight so more than 12 hours wasted because some clerk in Canada did not do its due diligence to send out an email. When we landed in Toronto we spent more than 20 minutes for the ground crew to attach the ramp, because they did not have personnel. To conclude we will never ever fly Swoop, and there is no word of lie here.

### "such a bad experience"
I had such a bad experience, they let my kids seat alone without my parent, I had to beg them for me to seat with them. I would never recommend it, as well as we had 3 hours delays without informing us what happens

### "a huge inconvenience"
This is the second time this year Swoop has caused flight cancellations disrupting important family events. It is impossible to contact Swoop to speak to a representative. My daughter bought a Swoop ticket from Toronto to Victoria for a reasonable price. She was flying out for our family reunion and her sisters milestone 50th birthday and was coming 4 days early to help us with all the plans. The day before she was to leave, Swoop cancelled, "Due to Unscheduled Maintenance", without the courtesy of a 24 hour notice. (Swoop sent a second email stating the reason for the cancellation was incorrect and then gave a second reason for the cancellation!) The flights Swoop offered to re-book were all a minimum of 9 1/2 hours as opposed to her original 5 hour direct flight. Swoop said she would also have to pay the fare difference at this very late notice. The only flight she could get to Victoria to make it on time for the family reunion, arrived late afternoon, on the day of the family gathering. She arrived here at 2:30 pm. As a result we had to scramble to do all the event planning which our daughter was going to take care of. My husband just had a knee replacement and I am working in my older years so this is a huge inconvenience and disruption for all of us. After the stress and disappointment, if you can imagine this, there was a second cancellation at 4pm Saturday. She was to leave at 8:00am the next morning with no possibility to re-book. In order to get to Victoria on Sunday, the day of the family celebration, she had to book a one way ticket with Air Canada and Lynx Air from Toronto to Victoria with a 2 1/2 hour stop over in Calgary for $800. The original Swoop flight was listed at $120. My daughter investigated her cancelled flight and discovered the Swoop flight was not cancelled but was "fully booked" (see screen shot). We believe that Swoop bumped her lower fare ticket in order to accommodate later higher priced tickets. This poor treatment has happened to many people. We've spoken to a large number of friends about Swoop's unprofessional business practices and now both a friend and another family member have just decided to cancel their Swoop tickets because they are afraid their plans will be ruined too.

### "massive delays and unknowns"
NEVER AGAIN! Second time flying Swoop and second time with massive delays and unknowns. We’re currently stuck in Puerto Vallarta, didn’t have an update about any delays prior to getting through security and to the gate. Now been three hours and no communication what’s going on. We’re travelling with two kids under 6. We just want to get home. We’ll 100% never fly Swoop again. For the record, we didn’t fly Swoop with intention to save money, it was just the provider that was included with the vacation package booked. We flew WestJet down.

### "Worst experience, round-trip"
In 28 of February, I and my wife and my little son went to Toronto Pearson airport to get flight of WO0640 Swoop to have vacation 4 days to Cancun. First they told us your flight has 4 hours delay but They changed it to five hours delay, the thing is almost all other flights were on time and only this flight had such a long delay? and finally after six hours delay (in total nine hours staying in the airport and crying my baby, finally we went to airplane to go to Cancun. But the nightmare started when we wanted to turn back to Toronto. Our flight time was for 10:10 PM (4th of march flight # WO0679 ) a few hours before flight time, I received an email from Red Tag company that your flight is cancelled and is changed to 4:45 AM then a few hours after that I received a second email directly from Swoop that your flight is cancelled and changed to 2:15 AM. So around 12 o’clock in the midnight we went there, but there was no agent or front desk agent of Swoop and not even anybody to answer our questions. Finally a airport security who helped us told me your flight has 25 hours delay and you should go and turn back tomorrow night at 11 PM We got a taxi to find a hotel for us but all the hotels are full, after finding no hotel he was driving and taking us to a very dangerous looking place in the middle of a jungle but I asked the driver turn back to the middle of the city. He dropped off us with our luggage and are backpacks and three years old baby crying all the time in the middle of the city. We were searching for a hotel which all of our packages up to 7 AM. Finally around 7:30 we could find a hotel . From other hand at 10 o’clock in the morning of Toronto I had 27 students because my business is teaching art in only Sunday and Monday. So I lost a big part of my income in that day. The comedy part of this nightmare was the compensation of Swoop, when we wanted to turn back to Canada at 11 PM (5th of march) they gave us a $20 meal coupon only. I and all of my family will never ever, and in any situation will travel with this airline in the future. Worst experience, round-trip.

### "Insanely unprofessional"
I had booked a round trip from Toronto to Edmonton 4 months before my trip. I was supposed to leave March 10th 2023 except both of my flights were cancelled. I had no emails from them for confirmation and no help when trying to contact them for months to make sure my trip was still as planned. 4 days prior to me leaving I finally found my reservation number through a screen shot I took luckily. I looked up my flight and both were cancelled. There were no other alternative flights available and the flights with other airlines were now $1000 and up. Originally my flight was $200.00 for 3 days. So there was no way I was doing that. The only way to contact them is by email and Facebook messenger. I emailed them many times over those 4 months asking for my itinerary and no response. I was so upset that I was unable to contact anyone to have an option to change my flight times and now I’m missing my best friend picking out her wedding dress. They’re extremely unprofessional and ridiculously hard to contact. I’ll never book swoop again. Insanely unprofessional. Worst airline ever.

### "not be flying with them again"
Took Swoop in Jan 2023 on a domestic trip Victoria to Toronto with 3 flight delays arriving more than 6 hours later than planned. On my return trip home in March the flight was canceled two days in a row with only offering WestJet options with layovers when the flight was initially direct. Customer service is appalling, no compensation for lost wages, hotels, etc. for having to wait 3 days to travel. Will not be flying with them again.

### "rude and confrontational"
Terrible people skills from flight attendants - they were very rude and confrontational. Multiple delays to flight. Seemed to cut corners to save time, instead of checking that all carry on items were stowed under seats, they made an announcement saying they don't have time so please stow your things. Same for seatbelts.

### "don't care about customers at all"
After 4 delays on the way to Edmonton, we waited in the plane 20 minutes. When we got to Edmonton we sat waiting for the crew to show up for 15 minutes at 4:00, instead of scheduled 12:25 arrival. Then the return trip March 5/23, 2 delayed then load, de ice, wiper issue, then back to airport, deplane and finally cancelled. No accommodation offered, No offer to get you on another flight, you’re on your own and then ticket prices tripled within an hour for the next flight. They don't care about customers at all.

### "flight rescheduled 4 times"
This airline company should not exist. Never tried it before and will never use it again. There is no phone# to call. The email or messenger has no value as no one will respond. Our flight got rescheduled 4 times and last night was changed again and our last day of our vacations has been a disaster. All day in airport and we are supposed to leave at 11.15pm and arrive maybe at 3am, originally scheduled to arrive by 7.30pm. There is no consideration from this company to any customer.

### "what a terrible experience"
Lord, what a terrible experience we have had with Swoop! They cancelled our flight at the last minute leaving us stranded. Now, I realize this is an ultra low cost airline and it serves us right to have succumbed to the lure of saving 50 bucks but this is preposterous - it seems, there are no human beings that work for this airline! None! This might work when things go OK, but when things bad it's a nightmare. I won't go through the whole ugly process of finally getting to PV or the downstream effects on things like car rentals and Airbnb rentals etc., but I will encourage you to NOT entrust your vacation to this bizarre enterprise.

### "by far the worst airline"
Not Verified |  Believe everything that you have read. Swoop is absolutely by far the worst airline I have had the misfortune of booking with. The flight was cancelled due to ‘weather’ when it was going to be/ was a perfectly lovely day. The snow from the previous day was not bad, stopped before 7 am, the flight was scheduled for 6:40 PM. While an email did arrive almost 24 hrs in advance there was no opportunity to get in touch with someone. I stayed on the chat for over 2 hours. Their auto-assistant chat did not even have an annoying pop up saying that an agent would be with you, every 15 mins I wrote in chat to see if it was open. I did not get through to support. I submitted a refund request, with ironically said it would be reviewed by customer service. Seeing as multiple people have alluded to, this seemed ominous given there was NO customer service or human beings that you can actually contact. No emails as everyone has noted, you pay for everything on this airline more than with the bigger brand carriers. I now see why they are able to charge so little, they cancel many flights, re- book a small percentage of passengers from multiple flights and do not credit or refund you, they are impossible to get to.

### "9 hour flight delay"
9 hour flight delay without any explanation or notification. Had to sit in the airport and wait all day. Could not speak to anyone from Swoop and online chat said someone would respond within 48 hrs. Brutal

### "I’m not sure if Swoop intends to repay us"
March 9, 2022 I booked 5 flights for myself and my family with Swoop from Toronto to Orlando for a family vacation. The flight was on Saturday May 21, 2022. The flight got delayed numerous times that day and ultimately got cancelled. That same day Swoop emailed passengers with the following message: "You may also submit a hotel receipt for reimbursement up to $250CAD. Please email your receipt to [email protected] and include the following: First and Last name, reservation code, Email address and phone number on the reservation. I submitted this information on May 24, 2022 then followed up again in August and then November but still haven't heard back and haven't received any refund. I’m not sure if Swoop intends to repay us for the hotel expense.

### "Book with a better airline"
Not Verified |  Do not book a flight with Swoop! They are so unhelpful. I booked a flight from Montego Bay to Toronto. I went through security, and the flight was delayed several times until it was cancelled. We all waited around for so long and there were no swoop representatives to help us or direct us in any way. We just kept searching for hours for anyone to help us. There were no announcements made about the cancellation either. We all found out through email. After many hours, we were let out of the airport and had to find places to stay, pay for them (with no compensation at all from Swoop), and told that they would email us when our rescheduled flight would be. We eventually got rescheduled for 9AM the next day and ended up actually departing around 10:30 AM. Once we arrived in Canada, there was a delay for the plane to arrive to the gate and our luggage was extremely delayed. Again, there were no swoop representatives to help us. No announcements were made about the luggage either. Almost 2 hours after landing, I finally was able to find my bag. I have since reached out to Swoop through their FB 'customer service'. They have told me that there will be no compensation through them because they said the cancellation was uncontrollable, but in reality, we were told that the airline couldn't leave because when they arrived in Jamaica, the crew was over their time. This is so unacceptable and ridiculous. You also have to pay separately for your bags and if you want any food or drinks on the plane. It's marketed as an ultra low budget airline, but it is not worth it. You end up spending more due to all their inconveniences. Book with a better airline.

### "worst customer service"
Not Verified | Our flight was leaving from Toronto to Cancun at 6am so we had be there 2 hours early for check in we live 4-5 hours away from airport so we drove all night without sleeping, they checked us and boarded the plane FULL. Told us were waiting for luggage to load, about an hour later captain says he is canceling flight everyone off plane. Swoop has no answers or refunds or other flights to offer anyone on the plane so most of us just kind of stuck here. No other flights heading to Cancun until the next night - basically ruined my trip. My hotel was cancelled as it was an all inclusive trip, flight and hotel. Swoop has the worst customer service couldn't get thru to them online, by phone and even the representative at counter had no answers for all these angry travelers. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BOOK WITH SWOOP.

### "They were unsupportive throughout the entire process"
Absolute nightmare. They cancelled my 7am departing flight at 1am when I was sleeping. Wake up to the automated email notifying me they have automatically rebooked me on the same flight the next day. This doesn’t work for me. Their chat is unavailable overnight so can’t get a hold of anyone. Finally make it to my destination 9 hours later than supposed to after a whirlwind of a morning, rescheduling hotel, rental cars, split off from the individuals I was travelling with, and a direct flight from TO to Kelowna now takes me to Vancouver then Kelowna. The extra leg room and baggage I purchased with Swoop does not transfer over to my WestJet flight and there are no upgrade seats even available for me to purchase with WestJet. If I thought this couldn’t get any worse the same thing happens a few days later on my return flight! Same exact 1am email for a 7.30am flight! I swear they were both automated and cancelled because the flights were not full. Again no support. I eventually arrive at my home destination 18 hours after originally expected, again with a layover. Miss Superbowl with my family and friends and an extra day of work. I reach out to Swoop regarding compensation and they denied it. They were unsupportive throughout the entire process and I am not exaggerating when I say this was a living hell to experience. All I can say is thank god I was not travelling with small children at the time. I will never fly swoop again. I will always pay the extra dollar moving forward if it means I can just call someone on the phone. Swoop does not have a phone line and will take sometimes 45 minutes to an hour to respond to a simple question for help! Save your sanity and don’t fly Swoop. These guys need to be put out of business they are a joke of an operation.

### "There was no customer support"
I had heard mixed reviews on Swoop but decided to give them a try, I bought round trip flights from Abbotsford to Puerto Vallarta. The flights were reasonable but they ding you on everything else. You are required to pay 60+ dollars for a carry on AND 70+ for your checked baggage, then you also need to pay for seat selection. So, when all is said and done you’re paying the exact same as a non-budget airline. That’s not even the worst part, our flight was delayed on our trip down, which was inconvenient but we figured things happen. Then the evening before our return flight going home we got a notice that our flight was delayed again, we sat in the airport all day and our flight was delayed a total of 5 times. Just as our extremely delayed flight was supposed to be boarding, a flight attendant deplanes and announced our flight was cancelled because the staff was “too tired”. Now I understand a long day, but then there was no follow up on what we were all to do. She said we would receive an email with instructions and that was it. There was no customer support or anyone willing to assist all the stranded travellers. Every single passenger had to scramble to find themselves a hotel for the night at 9:00pm with zero help or care from Swoop. The promised email was not sent until 2:30am, stating our flight was now going to be leaving at 8:30am; if I had not been up and waiting for said email we wouldn’t be getting home. Once we arrived at the airport, we were greeted with more staff and flight delays.

### "Worst experience ever"
Worst experience ever, I wouldn’t recommend this airline to anyone. Flight was delayed both ways for hours. No food. Everything takes forever. They charge extra for everything so it makes just as expensive as any other airline.

### "Swoop is a joke"
Got to London no issues, flight on time, weather perfect in both locations. 100pm they cancelled our 120pm flight. Set it back up for the next morning at 7. Reason being they set the flight times to late and they can't get us through Sanford customs before 5pm when they close. I see I'm not the first person to have this review. They won't do anything about expenses in Florida or the lost time for the travel day in London. Gate staff were good but just minimum wage employees that have just about as much info as we have. In the shop and I don't care about the flight quality or leg room because if you can't even set up a flight schedule that works I don't have a lot of faith in anything else you can do. Swoop is a joke.

### "Customer service is non existent"
Terrible. Flight cancelled 10 mins before take-off. A problem we find out is very common because they have no clout to keep US customs open 20 mins late in Orlando. They just see this as a minor inconvenience to customers. Flight staff flew the plane back empty. Now sure how that helps with the low cost model. Customer service is non existent. Apparently there’s no chance of refund. Everyone at the gate complaining of frequent cancellations. Do not book if you need your plane to take off with you on it. Will never book Swoop or WestJet again.

### "such a bad customer service"
Not Verified |  Flight was ok although delayed. Landed at 2.20am. No luggage. No agent. An officer asked us to go out to departures to enquire. Went to departures, nobody available. Spoke to someone, took a pic of the tag to enquire. 3am. Swoop opened for another flight check in. Spoke to agent. Already 4am. She acknowledged someone called a supervisor and we needed to wait. We asked for a follow up call as it had been 1 hour already. She asked to wait 30 mins more as "there had just been a call" although the call x supervisor had been 1 hour ago. Another swoop agent arrives to check in. We go and tried to speak to her. She is upset asked us to wait. She comes back 15 mins later and asked us to go to domestic flights and wait there. We explained it was an international flight and the reason to go to domestic and wait. She answered I am telling you what I was told. I do not know or can do anything. We reiterate the flight was from Cuba and asked why we need to go tp domestic. She stops and thinks and said she would call supervisor again. It is 5am already and nobody knows anything. We tried to ask several times what we are waiting for there. Both agents are very upset and extremely rude. Supervisor shows up at 5.30 because there was a big issue with another entire flight. She says they know nothing and have no idea where our luggage is in Canada or in Cuba and can't be tracked. So, from 2.30 to 5.30 am they just kept ignoring us and being rude. I have never witnessed such a bad customer service at the airport or with any airline. I'd rather pay more to fly with another airline and get a better service. And our luggage is still missing.

### "Most unprofessional airline"
I will never fly with Swoop again. It took them until we were inches off the ground in PEI to figure out the weather was too bad to land. They rerouted us to Quebec where we sat on the tarmac facing issue after issue. We were stuck on the plane for 10 hours being given no info. They stated that we could get off of the plane but then we would not be eligible for a refund or nightly accommodations, so most of us stayed out with these expectations in mind. There was no accommodation in Toronto. They just rebooked our flight for Sunday morning vs Friday night and left the entire flight of people stranded at the airport for over 24 hours with no place to go. We were lied to and passed off to different people for hours and hours, each one telling us the last person had given “misinformation”. Then on top of that, they lost our luggage for hours when returning to Toronto. Swoop is responsible for the WORST travel experience I have ever had, and refused to offer a refund or credit as “the flight was rebooked within 48 hours due to weather”, ignoring all responsibility for previous info/statements they had made to our flight. Most unprofessional airline ever.

### "will never fly with Swoop again"
Let me start by saying I will never fly with Swoop again. We took a family vacation to Jamaica in January and there were 5 of us coming and going and ALL of our 5 flights got changed from 3 hours to 7 hours and we received NO compensation whatsoever even though I submitted my claims. Absolutely unacceptable and I had to rebook on different airline and lost my money. I have never been so disgusted with an airline and will NEVER fly Swoop again. I attached an example of the change: On January 15 I was scheduled to head back to Toronto to work for 4 days and depart at 1:20 in the afternoon as I needed to be at work at 6:00 am the next morning and they changed my flight until 7:25pm by 6 HOURS and by the time I flew home and waited 90 minutes for my luggage and got home it was 3:00 in the morning and I had to be up at 4:45 for work. I was told I would not be reimbursed which is ridiculous. 4 other members of my family also had all the flights changed to late day flights as well. Most horrible experience!

### "when it comes to service, no one is responsive"
Could say the worst flight I've ever been to. They pretend it's a cheap flight and you end up paying more than most airlines, they charge you for everything you could imagine they have disastrous quality. When we landed to Toronto airport from Cancun Mexico, our luggage was delayed for 1.5 hours for no reason. Around 200 tired passenger were waiting around the conveyer and not a single customer service member showed up to let us know what was going on. Staff in the airport even called for the customer service and no one showed up. They charge you to the last cent when receiving the money, but when it comes to service, no one is responsive.

### "flight was absolutely amazing"
Flew with Swoop from Abbotsford to Baja California, this flight was absolutely amazing. The flight attendants were cheerful and happy which made the flight great. There was snacks and drinks for purchase, the seats were comfy! Plane was on time and landed in Mexico 20 mins early! Luggage was all there! I highly recommend swoop. For all the negative talk and reviews on swoop from people, I did not experience anything negative about this airline. Everyone has their own opinion and Swoop was a wonderful airline! !

### "would never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Honestly I would never fly with them again. They changed my flight twice by a day each time, as well as my return flight by 2 days. When I contacted them about this they were extremely unreasonable and gave boilerplate responses. Forget trying to get them on the phone, they charge for that.

### "I will never fly Swoop again"
Not Verified |  Once I had my flight booked with Swoop, I started receiving multiple promotions daily to my email. After weeks of endless junk emails, they notified me that my flight had been changed and moved a full day ahead of the date I had booked. They notified me of this, via email, which was lost in the clutter of endless junk mail I had been receiving from them. No phone call or any other for of message was used, and they charged me full price to book another flight since I had missed the one they moved. On my flight back, they rescheduled my flight 3 days ahead of what I had scheduled, but this time I was ready because they already had robbed me once. By the time you pay for baggage, you hardly save any money versus the cost of a regular air line, especially when they charge you for a flight they rescheduled without notifying you properly. I will never fly Swoop again after my experience

### "never recommend flying with Swoop"
Not Verified |  Terrible experience. 3 flights over the last 3 weeks gave been canceled outright. Reasons, such as 'unplanned maintenance' don't always warrant compensation, so you're left with few options. Our flight over the holidays was canceled, and then re-booked for 6 days later. En route to the airport (2.5 hour drive for us) the flight was canceled again. A single night in a hotel and $30 in airport vouchers did nothing to compensate for the 6 days stranded, and worse, missing Christmas with our families. The return flight was also canceled 1 hour prior to taking off, which meant that most customers were already through security. If you're fortunate enough to reach someone over their messenger system that isn't a robot, then prepare to have your excitement burst. They were entirely unhelpful. The price is competitive, which is a huge draw. But unless you're willing to compromise your schedule, plans, and ability to get to work, I would never recommend flying with Swoop.

### "amazingly terrible experience"
I’d like to personally thank Swoop for the amazingly terrible experience I’ve had on my trip. Get to the Cancun airport to return home and my digital boarding pass is not accepted at security so I had to wait in the check in line with every other passenger on this flight. The flight is delayed over 3h and they did give everyone a voucher for food which was useless because its not valid for Alcohol and all the restaurants at Cancun airport close between 9:30 and 10pm. Then get to the gate area and it just says departure at 00:18+? Originally planned to depart at 19:45. I have travelled a fair bit and never seen a plus next to the expected departure time. The staff were rude and considering it’s a discount airline a lot of stuff I could let slide but they treat you like herded cattle.

### "Customer service is the opposite of nice"
We came to the airport two hours early, waited till around 4.30pm, which is when we were supposed to board. The plane just comes into the stand, and no one is seen deplaning. We got an announcement that we were delayed due to customs because our aircraft came from Mexico. At 5.40, we started boarding. Legroom is very tight. No space to squeeze in backpack and jacket. The Menu Prices are rip offs. $4 CAD for a water bottle? We departed at 6.05pm compared to 5pm (original), Bathrooms are tight, nothing much fun to do. Hard landings, but very nice cabin crew. Customer service on another hand, is the opposite of nice. Their Boeing 737 MAX'S don't even have USB Ports. Honestly crazy. The Legroom on the MAX 8 is way worse.

### "a complete nightmare"
Not Verified | They don’t know what customer service is! My daughter flew to Halifax to see her friend and was so excited. They lost her suitcase! When she emailed them, they said they would deliver it to her friends house, which never did happen. The suitcase just sat at the Halifax airport. My daughter is 21 years old, and had crucial medication in her suitcase. For the five days that she was away, she only had the clothes on her back and had to arrange to get medication, which was very important and very difficult to replace. When you call the customer service line, no one answers. They then ask you to message them on Facebook. I tried that and it’s a computer talking to you. You can’t get an actual real life human being to discuss your issue. When the computer asked for the flight information, my daughters name and email address. It said there was nothing found to match the criteria , it turns out that her suitcase was in Halifax the whole time, and they didn’t bother to even attempt to deliver it to where she was staying. In fact, they didn’t even tell her that the suitcase was at the Halifax airport to give her the option to go pick it up. The whole thing is a complete nightmare, and I would highly recommend that no one ever use this airline. It’s absolutely disgusting.

### "so disheartened by this experience"
Not Verified | I flew in on Christmas day and paid extra for my bags and an additional fee for overweight luggage. First we were delayed over 4 hours! When I got to Kingston only 2 of my 5 bags arrived with no apology or explanation. 7 days later and still no luggage or response from Swoop. As I write this, my luggage is still lost (presumably in Toronto). The multiple numbers that I have called have been unresponsive as they are automated numbers. The customer service representative in Kingston is very nonchalant about the hundreds of bags left in Toronto (her words, not mine). Her attitude is disrespectful and she has no true understanding of customer service. I am so disheartened by this experience.

### "waited over 2hrs for our luggage"
We arrived today Dec 29 at 910pm. After a brief delay we were finally able to go get our luggage. We waited over 2hrs for our luggage with no news updates from the airline. I had to ask one of the baggage handlers for more information. Apparently there were no handlers to take the luggage off the plane. Furthermore, there was no one working the swoop desk to get information from. Finally a Swoop representative came in and she had no clue what was going on as she was just called in.

### "will never travel again with Swoop"
Our Swoop Flight WO745 from Las Vegas to Toronto on December 24 departure @ 2:30pm to Toronto @10:20pm Was delayed from 3:20pm then again to 4:50pm and again to 5:35pm and finally cancelled. And all they offered to us was a disgraceful $10 USD voucher per person. When ask for help at the check-in station they only provided us with a customer service call centre number which no representative pick up the line and directed us to email all supporting documents to their support centre. Our flight can only be rebooked for December 26th departure. From Saturday December 24th we have to stay at Las Vegas until Monday December 26th for the next available flight to Toronto. I’m so displeased with our Canadian base airline that can’t support our Canadian Citizens. The worst airline in the history of Canadian transportation community. Definitely will never travel again with Swoop.

### "a poorly managed airline"
Swoop airline gave me no options during a critical time when we were canceled on December 23rd. There is no customer service and no options for my family to fly to Puerto Vallarta. In their website they say that they will put you in a flight from WestJet if there is no availability but they canceled two flights and expected people to find a space in an already booked plane for later days. With a family of 4 thats not possible, is hard to find a spot for all. At the end i ended up losing all my reservations in Puerto Vallarta because a poorly managed airline.

### "been an absolute nightmare"
Booked the flight 2 months in advance then out of the blue canceled and changed to a different day. Trying to change it was impossible let alone cancel it. When we get after we got delayed for 2 hours and then once we got there our luggage was missing. We reported to get it back but it is apparently still in Canada even though we are in Mexico, not to mention with this we lost our connection flight because of this, didn't even offer a hotel or food, just $100 dolloars for the lost luggage that used need to wait 48 to even use been. Has been an absolute nightmare and don't recommend. You are wasting more money then you are saving with them and you ONLY buy the seat nothing else.

### "Avoid this company if you can"
Not Verified | The booking for travel on the 23rd was made as far back as October. The weather became very bad, and after numerous re-scheduling, the flight was finally fully cancelled for the 23rd of Dec. I had no choice but to inform my family who were waiting for me at the Edmonton airport that I was not travelling to Alberta this year. They then left the Edmonton area and drove off to Red Deer, Alberta about two hours away from Edmonton to celebrate Christmas. Swoop Airlines send me an email on the 24th indicating that they had rebooked me on one of their flights departing Abbotsford on the 24th. I had no way of travelling from Edmonton to Red Deer, so it made no sense for me to fly to Edmonton on the 24th. Apparently as it turns out, Swoop gets to keep my money, since this was a weather related cancellation and they offered me a flight a day after the day of my planned travel. I have flown with Swoop on numerous other previous occasions. It was tolerable for a short one hour flights. Generally pretty awful company and cabin habits of the cabin crews leave a great deal to be desired. Plus this policy of; The hell with your money, we offered you a flight the next day, if you didn't take it, that's not our problem, so we are keeping your money. Naturally I won't be getting my $577.00 back. So that 's a huge loss. But I don't ever have to travel with this company. There are other options. Avoid this company if you can. I'd give it zero stars across the board if I had the option.

### "the most unreliable airline"
Swoop is the most unreliable airline you could find. Shame on West jet. I booked a trip to Montego Bay in March 2022. The trip was supposed to be 5 days, Swoop changed the flight to 7 days then I had to rebook with West Jet and pay more money for the 5 days that I wanted. I booked a family vacation to Alberta in July 2022. My flight was cancelled once again. I was placed on a West Jet flight 2 days later. I lost money on car rental and hotel with no compensation from Swoop. I once again got ditched by Swoop yesterday December 22nd 2022. My family trip was cancelled, I don't know the reason because the weather was fine, many other airlines was going out of Pearson, my relatives prepared and payed for transportation. Swoop will spoil your vacation and your plans. Do not use this airline, they will disappoint you. Never again, I have learned my lesson the hard way 3 times in a row. Shame on you for always ditching your customers.

### "cancelled all their flights"
I have been nervously watching my upcoming Swoop flight from Toronto to Kelowna. I just looked at Toronto departures, and I found cancelled flight after cancelled flight. And it was around the 3rd flight that I realized all the flights I had seen were Swoop. So I searched Swoop specifically - it is currently 1:15 am on Dec 23 and Swoop cancelled every single one of their flights out of Toronto today. Every one. Including the very late flights, flights that don't leave for another 22 hours. Flair? One cancellation. WestJet? A few out of many. Swoop is the only airline that cancelled all their flights. Swoop is not a reliable airline.

### "lack of empathy and customer service"
Not Verified | The WORST airline and customer service. I had a flight booked for Thursday, found out on Sunday a family member had passed away. I wanted to try and move up my flight so I try calling the customer service line, they aren't taking calls... annoying but fine. I am told the way I need to speak with an agent is through Facebook... also frustrating but fine. I message the agent and explain the situation. When they respond there is no "sorry to hear" or sympathy regarding my situation just "there are no other flights available". When I ask if I can be added to a waitlist or standby they tell me no, that I would need to just keep checking in through Facebook...what kind of service is that? Extremely frustrating. I ask if I can look at changing or cancelling my flights they tell me I am going to need to pay a large fee. I ask again if there are exceptions as I, again, had a death in the family. Once again the agent responds with the same robotic response. I then air my frustrations, letting them know that I am disappointed in their lack of empathy and customer service. Not even a "sorry to hear" or "sorry for your loss but..". The agent then responds and basically tells me that because I paid for a "budget" (I paid almost $950 for my round trip from Toronto to Kelowna - which is absurd) I don't get the same "perks" that come with a full price flight. I took that as they don't offer compassion or just common customer service because I didn't pay for it. DISGUSTED in this airline, as someone who flies 8+ times a year and books for many family members I will NEVER book Swoop again.

### "worst airline I have ever used"
By far the worst airline I have ever used. The flight was delayed by over an hour to debag someone's luggage, which would normally be fine but then they must have left half the planes luggage on the tarmac. There was no one at the airport to even tell us that the luggage was not on the plane and it has been 4 days and no one will even answer as to where the luggage is or when it will be received. There is no one to reach by phone and they are not responding to social media msgs either. Do not check your luggage. The savings is not worth the loss of your belongings if they are more expensive than the extra $300 off the cost of the flight

### "Most dysfunctional airline"
Most dysfunctional airline to date. Pre check in not functional leading to long lines and poor support at airport. Over 90 mins to checkin to airline alone. Dozens of people left without service or luggage support No available customer service or consideration throughout booking process. Flights delayed 5 times, every delay notice coming 20min after scheduled departure. Not worth any discount as once fees for luggage added up, might as well have gone with one of the big three.

### "such a terrible airline"
Not Verified |  I've never experienced such a terrible airline before, and I've traveled to 40 countries. We were supposed to fly out of Hamilton today, and the flight was delayed because a staff member was late (delay due to "crew resources"). Finally boarded, only a few hours late. We were taxiing the runway when they decided the staff were going to time out and took us back to the gate. Had us go collect our luggage, kept us waiting in arrivals for 1-2 hours with minimal updates and mixed messages (just airport staff saying there may or may not be a flight), and no way to get food. Then they got our hopes up and had us recheck our bags and go through security yet again, to finally have the flight cancelled. All the staff said they worked for the airport and not Swoop, so they couldn't help us with anything but vague answers, and no ability to help with bookings. Basically told to wait for an email that would give us details. Swoop customer service phone line closes at 430 so of course no help there, and their messenger bot says it can take 72 hours to get a human. If they had just cancelled it instead of faffing about for six hours it might have been a less miserable experience. The next available flight we could rebook was in two days, so we got a refund and will fly another airline. I definitely won't fly Swoop again.

### "cost us a lot of money"
Not Verified |  Our Agency booked the whole package to Las Vegas flying with Swoop. Our flight was Dec 10 to Dec 15. When we were about to check in on Dec 9 on SWOOP website. It says our flight has changed to Dec 12 to 14. We already had everything booked and paid for including our hotel and activities. Swoop just changed our flights without any notice! Dec 12-14? So they expect us to fly there and come back in one day? How ridiculous is that? When we tried to contact SWOOP by phone, there's no one there to pick up the phone. There's no email to contact. The only way is through Messenger and after waited for a long time and repeated myself 5 times, they finally got back to me and told me to just cancel the flight. Now I have to cancel everything and some of the activities have no refund. And hotel cancellation has to be at least 48 hours or no refund. Swoop totally screwed us over. Ruined our trip and cost us a lot of money!

### "refused to refund the upgrade fee"
We paid extra to upgrade to seats with extra leg room. When we boarded, our seats were regular. On both departing and returning flights. On the return flight, we asked the agent at check in to make sure our seats were extra leg room. She confirmed they were. They were not. Contacted swoop and they refused to refund the upgrade fee. They also rescheduled both our departing and returning flights, shaving an entire day off of our vacation. They don’t even give you water on these flights. Just pay the $50 extra to fly with the regular airline.

### "yes believe the bad reviews"
Well, I was warned, yes believe the bad reviews. Our original flight out of Abbotsford was supposed to be in after nine then they moved it to 1:05 PM. I am literally sitting here now. They’ve now just delayed it again. They said because they can’t find the de-icer truck or the driver to drive it, nice, these people have basically ruined my vacation I already had to change airlines on the way home, because Swoop could meet their criteria to pick us up. Do yourself a favour spend the extra money and go WestJet and/or any other airline do not I repeat, do not let the cheapness of this airline fool you they will ruin your vacation.

### "their chat service is USELESS"
Not Verified | Do not fly Swoop! I booked a flight home for the holidays months ago because the price was great. My flight was cancelled 10 hours before the flight "due to weather" (it snowed in Vancouver) which is fine but the flight was rescheduled for the following day at 4pm! I had another (more expensive) flight to catch at 10am in Toronto so I had no other choice but to fly with another airline. Swoop is not available via phone and their chat service is USELESS. They will not give me anything but robotic answers. I understand the weather is out of their control but since I wasn't on the flight period I'd hope they'd give me a future credit or at least refund my $64 bag that wasn't on the plane. Do better Swoop.

### "why pay for a seat"
My experience with this airline has not been good. First off they cancelled my flight but agreed to move the date to another day and lucky for me I was flexible. I paid for my seats both ways and when I checked in the seat I paid for was correct and was listed on my boarding pass 2F. When I got to the gate and I went to board she said that was not my seat and they had no more window seats. I’m like how can that be, she had no answer. I was super angry because why pay for a seat when they just give it away.

### "Flight attendants were sub standard"
Not Verified |  Worst airline I have ever flown with. Do not expect anything at any time along the way. If you fly with them, do your research. I thought I did. Ticket agents were terrible. Flight attendants were sub standard. I could list a dozen things along the journey and back. Some of which were beyond there control but do not expect any customer service. Its just not there. The indifference was what really got me in the end.

### "Disgusting way to treat customers"
Not Verified |  Do not waste your money flying this airline. The savings in the fare is not worth your vacation. The check-in counter was busy when we arrived and by the time it was our turn, it was 57 minutes before the flight and they refused to accept our prepaid luggage. Had to fly with nothing, no help, no alternate options, no empathy and no refund for prepaid luggage. Disgusting way to treat customers. Customer service is a bunch of robots who copy/paste responses. They refuse to call out, saying they don’t have capabilities. I have never been treated so poorly and want anyone out there to avoid this stress. Do not fly with Swoop!

### "It was really a bad experience"
It was really a bad experience on the first and last flight with Swoop. On the flight date, there was confusion, even among Swoop representatives on where to go for US flight Swoop, when they are going to open accepting passengers' documents/tickets, and then it was a long wait to figure it out. At first, the Swoop representative couldn't find my seat, even though she saw my name, and then she asked me to book again at the booth and I did. But then because of some new regulations at the border for some passenger's documents, even when a CBP officer came with me to the Swoop booth and advised them and they took notes and they made sure I will get the refund but when I sent my claim, they replied me they are not going to refund me, even with those notes and CBP advise. I didn't even have a chance to do the flight to write a review for that, and I am not sure how that would be!

### "made a tough trip much more positive"
Jason was our lead attendant tonight and he was such a wonderful leader! I enjoyed his positive energy and the whole team made a tough trip much more positive. Thank you again to Jason, Gabbi, Warne, and Heidi from flight #561!

### "Will definitely recommend them"
I came to Abbotsford due to family emergency and booked my ticket last minute, my friend scared me that these flights cancel and lose the luggage too but my experience with them was great. The airport staff was very polite and understanding. And everything went great. Will definitely recommend them to friends and family.

### "done losing my time and money to them"
Not Verified | I have chosen Swoop 4xs and of those times, 2 have been cancelled/delayed until the next day. It is a 50/50 risk of cancellation with Swoop. Despite there claim of a live rep you can call 24/7, there is no live customer service — it is a recording that directs you to their social media. Messages can take up to 3 weeks for a response (despite their claim to respond within 72 hours). Bookings must be changed within 24hrs if you need a refund, but they do not respond within that time frame. With their constant time changes and cancellations, Swoop takes advantage of customers. I'm done losing my time and money to them.

### "don't know what they are doing"
Not Verified | These clowns don't know what they are doing. Typically you board from the back of the plane forward after doing business and/or first class. We sat in zone 1 which is more to the front of the plane. Due to sitting in an aisle seat I was hit by almost every person walking by including the flight attendants. On top of that I had my back pack removed from the overhead compartment to make room for someone's else's. In all my years of flying if the over head compartments are full they normally take the carrying on luggage and put it with the checked bags. In this particular instance we had elderly people with back problems having their backpacks removed from over head compartments to have their backpacks stored under the seat in front of them. This poses as a problem for people with back and knee problems as you feel like a sardine in these already crammed planes. These people are apparently young and inexperienced and use a major lesson in customer service as it is us, the paying customer, that is the reason why they have jobs!

### "could not care less about customer service"
Not Verified |  Do not fly on this airline. I know that no airline is perfect and that there are tons of things that can go wrong from a logistical standpoint, but how the company handles this is important. Swoop could not care less about customer service. There is no working phone number to speak with a CSR. Emails are unanswered. Tweets are promised a 72-hour turnaround time. The FB Messenger bot is useless. Do not fly on this airline. We were actually booked on another airline LAS - YYZ but wanted to go home earlier. Swoop had an early afternoon flight (as did AC and WestJet, but we wouldn't be able to sit together). We booked it with extras - checked & cabin baggage, priority boarding. When the agent took our bags only then were we advised that the flight was delayed several hours. Although it was about 2 hours before the flight was originally scheduled to depart Vegas, the inbound aircraft had not even yet left Toronto. The departure was ultimately put off to 5:30 pm and we were each given a $10 meal voucher for our trouble. My originally booked flight, which I had to cancel, departed on time at 5:05. (Flair). When the aircraft arrived at the gate, the boarding process began with our zone 1. We passed through boarding pass scanning, and were met with a long line of people waiting to board in the jetway. We were towards the back of the line, near the entrance to the jetway. We waited there about 15 - 20 minutes before some people in hi-vis jackets passed by us and then quickly came out to abruptly tell us the flight was cancelled. We immediately re-booked on the later, red-eye AC Rouge flight 1704 (which was excellent and on-time, by the way). We had to be in Buffalo by 11am on Saturday. That red-eye was our last chance to meet that deadline. Swoop later emailed us with a link to book an overnight room and rebooked our flight to the next morning, Saturday Nov. 12, at 10am. It ultimately left late, at 11:50 am, arriving in Toronto at 6:30 pm, about 24 hours later than originally scheduled. Do not fly this airline. Literally choose anything else- rent a car one way if necessary. Since we had only just bought our ticket that same morning, I certainly assumed that getting a refund would not be a problem. It has now been well over 72 hours with no communication whatsoever from the airline in response to our many inquiries, and no real way to reach them. You are better off walking. Although Swoop said that the delay was somehow due to customs & immigration delays (even though the passengers on the inbound flight YYZ - LAS would have all precleared US customs in Toronto), I suspect that the real issue was that the delay had taken the crew out of its allowed time for service, and they had a mandatory rest period before the flight could resume on its way back to Toronto. Why do I think so? Because I sure didn't see any new crew show up and I was at that gate literally from 11:30 am - 5:30pm. So, they'll try to avoid having to make refunds by lying about the reason for both delays - inbound to LAS and outbound from LAS.

### "Horrible customer experience"
I had reserved a ticket with Swoop in advance but the flight was canceled for "unforeseen safety reasons". Not fun but not the end of the world either. However, they asked me to chose my seat again for the next flight which I did and got a seat with extra leg space. So I get on my flight and low and behold, they give me a regular seat. Now that in itself is not a big deal, but definitely not fun for a 6'3"ft guy who paid extra money for that extra space. The air attendant told me that they had to change plane last minute and couldn't give me a seat like that but that Swoop will refund me. Ultimately, I've tried to get a refund to no avail. I've tried emailing, calling and Facebook messenger and still can't get a good answer. Horrible customer experience and they will charge you for things you don't even get. Save your money and go on a reputable airline. To summarize, I was delayed 3 days on my trip, charged a seat with extra leg room and ultimately not able to reach a human by phone or get compensation or a refund. I will post this horrible experience everywhere I can write a review.

### "Anger, frustration, missed flights"
Flight has been delayed several times. It is supposed to take off at 11. After 3 postponed departures now it is scheduled for 5.30 Hope they won't cancel it on me. What a nightmare. I am still stuck at Las Vegas Airport. Earlier, 2 flights have left for Toronto already. I made a mistake choosing Swoop. A word to the wise: Do not - repeat- do not fly this airline. Anger, frustration, missed flights will result.

### "This company has the worst customer service"
Not Verified |  This company has the worst customer service - I want to change a name on a flight, simply remove a middle name so that the ticket matches the passport. It has taken me 3 weeks of trying to contact customer service via their messenger platform. The phone number provided simply states we can't take your call and visit xxxx online for Bot assistance, first attempt I provided flight info, booking confirmation # and the request, the rude reply was unbelievable. The cost of the flight after all the hidden fees, turns out to be equal to or more than AC or Air Transat. Hire staff or truly make this a discount airline instead of roping customers in and then hidden fees! Seriously $15.00 charge to speak to someone! Just remove the name so the ticket matches the passport (btw the name was auto populated on their booking site from the previous name booked. I have never written a negative review about anything in my 65 years, this is unacceptable and I will never fly with this airline again.

### "none of them checked my hand luggage"
I have a complaint to report: The reason for writing is to expose my discomfort from a very bad experience I had in the service in this airline. I have traveled for work reasons on June 9, 2022 from Toronto to Halifax. and when I got to the area where the staff checks the luggage a young guy told me that the luggage of my suitcase that I had paid for was fine. But in the carry-on bag that I had with me I had a 15.6-inch laptop, he made me pay $67.80 for it, that’s more than the cost of my baggage of several kilos of weight. you should have more control of your staff. That’s why I’m leaving my review here and I believe that those people like me will never again travel on your airline including that I already asked my family and friends because these experiences are discussed at family gatherings and social. It is very uncomfortable and annoying that your review staff does this with consumers because you owe it to the consumer and with these actions many people move away and avoid traveling on your airline again. Then I traveled 3 more times between Halifax and Toronto on other airlines and none of them even checked my hand luggage, much less charged me a cost for said bag. if it passes the formal airport review it’s fine, but we are NOT charged extra by travel agencies. Guide your staff better or renew them constantly because it seems that they are NOT happy doing their job. R.B.

### "Not impressed and never again"
Swoop is the worst airline I have ever flown with. Never Again. We booked the flight, weeks in advance and the flight got cancelled twice. The second time was less than 24 hours from check-in time. When we did check in for the second time, no qr code boarding pass was emailed to us and we couldn't access it through their poorly made website. Our friends flight also got cancelled and were asked to rebook, however after checking in their luggage, their flight got canceled 30 mins before take off. They rebooked their flights for the next morning when the concert is tonight and I highly doubt that they will ever be reimbursed. The flight we are on has empty seats even though my friends were told that the plane was full. After talking to the flight attendant asking why they couldn't board, apparently it was too late but they had already checked in and made it past security. Not impressed and never again.

### "by far was the worst experience"
This by far was the worst experience I've ever had on a airline. Our plane from Edmonton to Toronto was 135 min late. The lady couldn't do a tag for our luggage to get switched at the swoop desk. This is new to me same airline multiple places should be able to switch luggage on a connecting flight. We landed I had less than 1 hour to switch luggage because Edmonton was unable to. The swoop check in bag person just looked at me said nothing I can do. So I guess it's acceptable as a airline to be 135 min late. Half the people on our plane missed flight to Vegas. I guess I'll have no clothes in Jamaica for a couple day's and that's all good for the people who work at swoop. Save yourself the hassle not the money don't fly swoop first experience was Terrible. Zero customer service zero help people just looking at me and making me feel stupid.

### "legroom was more than I expected"
On-line check-in failed. Had to check in at airport. Long line at check in, which is typical for a LCC. Seat pitch left me with one inch of legroom, which was more than I expected. Seats did not tilt. Flight was delayed by almost an hour. After take off many people ran to the front of the plane. Was not expecting this. All seats had in-seat power, which was nice and unexpected.

### "Checkin system seats everyone in the back"
Checkin system seats everyone in the back. Upon boarding, the flight is delayed because they have to shuffle passengers to the front of the plane because of a weight imbalance. Safety first right. Just a coincidence how all the front seats are more $$ to sit in then the back and people don’t wana pay to sit in the front so the system seats 90% passengers in the back. So we spend 10 minutes shuffling passengers from the back free seats to the front paid seats then the flight is delayed due to a “airport” issue. Go figure. Profits over safety is the underlying moto for all “low cost” airlines.

### "Great customer service"
My first time traveling with Swoop and the service was amazing. Great customer service and a wonderful pilot who displayed such grace and respect. Thank you for such excellence and looking forward to Travel with you soon.

### "it will cost you more than booking with a reputable airline"
I am gobsmacked by what happened to us. We booked Swoop to go from Victoria to Toronto October 27, 2022. We were planning to go to Kingston for a reunion and return by Air Canada October 20 as that was the flight available so I could get back to work the following day. Our booking involved a rental car, a hotel and a return flight. The outgoing Swoop flight had been changed to two hours later than the original flight, we endured 90 minutes of line ups, stressing us about missing the flight, only to find out the incoming plane would not land due to wind so went to Vancouver instead. No other airline had this problem. They kept us on hold until for another 3 hours whereupon they canceled the flight and rebooked us for the next day. Unfortunately, that would get us to Kingston too late to get to much of what we were going for so we decided to cancel the trip as it seemed we would be spending most of it on a plane. We were able to cancel with Air Canada for the return, the hotel, and the car rental without much problem and get refunds or credits, but not with Swoop the cause of the problem! Furthermore we were unable to contact Swoop at all to cancel, so I had to physically return to the check in at the airport the next day to cancel with the check in agent. Stunningly, Swoop would offer no compensation, unlike all the other providers who had no part in causing this problem! I think that aside from extremely poor business practices this is a sign of a company in financial trouble that is soon to declare bankruptcy as they clearly do not care about PR. My advice is do not book with Swoop - it will cost you more than booking with a reputable airline.

### "My experience was great"
Not Verified | I read the reviews and they were most negative. Travelled from Toronto to Halifax. My experience was great, the flight was on time, customer service was great, tickets were very reasonable even with paying for seats and baggage. Will travel again.

### "I will not book with Swoop again"
Paid for "Modifly" as they were the only airline flying out of Hamilton to Vegas we wanted to try them for the convenience of the Hamilton airport. Unfortunately 2 days before the trip 2 of the 3 people in our party came down with Covid and as I was also exposed we decided not to go. When I went online to change our flight date we were unable to use the online system despite numerous tries, it kept showing an error code every time we tried to confirm at new date. There is nothing on the web site giving a phone number to call but we found one online which I called and got a message stating they would could not answer but gave an email address or the option to contact on Facebook, twitter. The email bounced back so I messaged on Facebook, to date I have not received a reply. I should be noted that you have to make the change a minimum of 24 hours before the flight and we are now past that time. I did not object to all of the extra charges we used most of them and find I think as long as they are not hidden there should be no objection. I will not book with Swoop again.

### "Hidden fees everywhere"
Don't use swoop. Hidden fees everywhere than they do not allow any cancelations without a compete loss of all money. We paid 911$ for a round trip to Vegas. Due to unforeseen obstacles we were unable to make it. We then tried to cancel and they wouldn't cancel or refund anything. Complete waste of 911$ for nothing. I will not ever use swoop or West jet again. As they are the parent company who allows this type of business to operate

### "No customer service"
Not Verified |  Absolute excuse for an airline. No customer service and the most horrendous attitude of all. My boyfriend had a serious medical condition and I wanted to change the date of flight. Because I missed "72hrs" window (literally 10 mins left for the window to be closed) it kicked me out of the website and no matter how many times I called and asked no one got back to me because it was a weekend. This terrible airline tricks you with cheap tickets and you're stuck with absolutely no options. They even wanted to charge us for personal item!

### "They have zero customer service"
Had my flight cancelled at Halifax airport. Within 12 hours, they rescheduled four times claiming operational and safety issues. We were supposed to fly out Saturday evening and the flight we were on eventually flew out Monday. We rebooked with another airline that got us home Sunday evening because we had to get back. There is no compensation for the return flight. No compensation for the extra night at a hotel. No compensation for meals or taxi fares. By far, this is the worst carrier I have ever flown with and I have traveled with dozens of airlines. Further more the taxi vouchers they provided to us in Halifax to get to our hotel were not accepted by the cab drivers because they said Swoop does not compensate them, so we had to pay taxi fares with our money. They have zero customer service as you cannot talk to a live agent. It is all done by electronic recordings sending you back in circles. When we flew with another airline, we noticed the departure flights screen for Swoop at the airport had two other flight cancellations. I thought how many times do they do this on a daily basis. This company is a scam. They are quick to take your money and send you travel ads but when you want to contact them, they don't exist. Spend the extra $100 on a ticket and book with reputable airlines. In the end it will save you money, time and all the hassles and headaches of of having to re-plan your travel plans on your own because they do not help you find alternate arrangements. You are left at the airport having to fend for yourself.

### "Changes of this magnitude are totally unacceptable"
Not Verified |  Never again. Do not fly with Swoop, the money you save in airfare will be used up in inconvenience, lost accommodations and car rentals. They changed our flight from 8am to 9.20pm arriving in Hamilton after the rental car counter was closed. That means an extra night in Hamilton even though our hotel in Niagara on the Lake is already paid for. Changes of this magnitude are totally unacceptable and not deserving of continued loyalty. I would give them all zeros if I could.

### "all I see is an airline that doesn’t stick to what they are offering"
I have flown Swoop a couple of times but never without an issue. I had an upcoming flight booked to San Diego this month and Swoop cancelled my flight all together. They just decided they were no longer flying there. I have another flight booked to go to Ottawa in November and I just got notification today that they changed my ticket to completely different days. It’s my sisters birthday and I was planning on being there for it - now my flight doesn’t come in till the next day so I will now only be there for just over 52 hours because of the the flight changes. Swoop is fine if you don’t care to make plans and you’re a willy nilly kind of traveller. It’s ridiculous how they advertise great deals on flights but they never stick to their schedules. You will end up spending more money like my daughter did when her return flight was cancelled a few days before her departure and she’d scrambled to get another flight that cost her way more money in the end than she would’ve spent going with a more trustworthy airline. I do not know how they stay in business. I was very happy to see the flights I could get out of Edmonton when they started, but now all I see is an airline that doesn’t stick to what they are offering and in the end you will only be disappointed. And you cannot speak to a customer service agent ever! So Frustrating!

### "I would never fly Swoop again"
Not Verified |  I would never fly Swoop again. They will change your flights to completely different times and dates with only 2 weeks notice at best, and they won't compensate you in any way. Sometimes they change your flights the day before. They explain that it is a schedule change, not a cancellation, and therefore you're not entitles to any compensation. They won't book you onto WestJet or any of their affiliates, so don't count on that. If you get anything back it's in Swoop credits only, so you have to deal with that nightmare all over again. Friends had their flight delayed 9 hours with 3 hours notice and got compensated, after 3 weeks of arguing, in credits they'll never use. Also their apps and system constantly crash. We were stranded at the airport once because they changed our flight last minute and we couldn't load the new boarding pass. Of course their check in terminals were closed because they bumped our flight up an hour and now we were 'late', so we were considered to be the ones in the wrong even though they changed our flight.

### "Will never be flying Swoop again"
Not Verified |  Worst airline customer service I have ever seen. My flight was cancelled (after already being rescheduled once by a whole day which made me incur hotel more costs for another night) which left me scrambling to purchase another flight to get home. I requested a refund or credit at minimum and was told that I was not eligible for either well over a month later. Will never be flying Swoop again.

### "She was so helpful and kind"
My family flew with swoop for the first time from Edmonton to Halifax and today we are flying back to Edmonton from Halifax. The lady at the counter who checked us in was the sweetest person ever! She was so helpful and kind. Our flight seemed to have bigger seats and more legroom than WestJet (who we typically flew with). There are no bells and whistles on this flight but that doesn’t matter to us!

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service, you can't actually speak to a human, their auto-bot replies come weeks after you make an inquiry & after going back & forth for 8 weeks I'm not entitled to any cost reimbursement for our trip despite paying for the additional medical or baggage insurance. Also our return flight was delayed. I was traveling for business while my family was tagging along for a vacation. I thought this would be low cost option however by the time you pay for all the fees (don't forget to pay for your seat selection so your aren't separated from your child - as stated right on their booking website?!?!) and ALL baggage - carry on included, it works out to be the same or more than flying with a real airline. Lesson learned however it meant getting the times required so I figured lesson learned. Next I paid for Swoop's extra baggage & cancellation insurance (provided by CHUBB Insurance Brokers) just in case. Prior to leaving our one family member fell ill and was subsequently diagnosed with lung cancer. To accommodate specialist appointments our travel dates changed and the affected family member was no longer going to join the trip - I couldn't simply modify the booking but was advised by the customer service department for the CHUBB Insurance (Swoop's bot directed me here) to rebook the flights for the new dates & submit for reimbursement to their claims department after we returned. However, you cannot simply book for only those going but rather for the entire party even when 1 passenger is no longer going on the trip. At flight check in time, we had to advise the boarding desk of the 1 passenger not joining (should be a simple task) however take off was still delayed both ways as the check in desk didn't inform the flight crew so they were trying to track down the missing passenger. All on board purchases were very expensive & must be paid for by credit card. The plane itself was very small & seats felt cheap & uncomfortable. The onboard wifi was choppy and kept cutting out and the cabin crew were very rude. On return departure a ground crew member was complaining loud enough that us other passengers could hear how annoyed they were at having to help a passenger onto the plane that was in a wheelchair! I have flown other budget airlines before and found their service & planes much better. So since nothing (flight change fee, new flights for all 4 passengers even though only 3 were traveling, additional insurance) was reimbursed even though I paid extra for this optional insurance, I am now out $3348.17 plus the costs of the multiple physician notes the insurance adjusters kept requiring (had to send in 4 different notes over the course of the 8 week claim battle). This company and it's optional insurance is a joke. Way to take people's money for nothing. I am hoping to save someone else their hard earned money.

### "not entitled a refund or compensation"
Not Verified |  My husband and I booked a trip to Winnipeg to see our son. When flying with Swoop to Winnipeg, the flight was good and the accommodation was excellent. When it was time to return home, received an email from them that our return flight was canceled. I tried to get a hold of someone to see what would happen next. This was not to be. I request for a refund as the next available flight was not convenient for us. When I finally was able to get home, I sent a request for a refund and compensation for another night of accommodation, difference in flight cost and the Uber ride we had to use to get our car that was in Hamilton. I have just received an email stating that they are sorry and that it was not their intention but it was out of their control. ( resources) and I am not entitled a refund or compensation. This Company is offering a service, taking your money then not providing the service. I want my money you owe me SWOOP

### "no service at all in my case"
Worst service ever - actually no service at all in my case. I had to fly from Edmonton to Ottawa. Got my breakfast close to gate for departure. Did hear any advertising for starting this boarding, end of boarding, no "last call". On the same time I did hear the advertising of another air companies . Finally came to the gat#68 at 10:35 a.m The the supervisor didnt give me to get in. The flight has departed at 10:51 a.m. Supervisor didn't try to do nothing to let me walk in. So, the low cost came on account of service.

### "Do not fly with Swoop"
Do not fly with Swoop, Horrible and unreliable personnel and flights. July 2nd father with 3 teenagers travelling from Pearson to Las Vegas for a 6 day trip including a surprise birthday party being held on July 3rd. July 2nd 7:00 am- receive the itinerary and receipt via email (paid for 3 carry on bags ($186.00), 4 modifly ($40), 4 selected seats $108.00)- Total $334.00 departure time is 2:55 pm (airline recommends arriving 3 hours before) 12:09 pm-receive an email of flight delay. Now departing at 3:30. Board the plane along with the other passengers at approx 3 pm. 4:04 pm-receive an email of flight delay. Now departing at 4:15 pm 4:16 pm - receive an email of flight delay. Now departing at 5:15 pm - 5:02 pm-receive an email of flight cancellation! The best is that they use the reason "unplanned maintenance" which apparently gives the airline the right to refuse any claims for compensation. All passengers were told that the airline would pay for a hotel if needed. My family got into a taxi and returned home, stopping for a bite to eat as we were all quite hungry after being in an airport for 7 hours! I Was not able to get another direct flight until after the weekend on West Jet thus missing the family birthday gathering and shortening our vacation by 2 days. Swoop refused to reimburse the extra costs paid for the flight that was cancelled nor any reimbursement for expenses incurred as a result of 3 delays and 1 cancellation! July 11th filed a request for reimbursement-no response September, filed a 2nd request and received a reply denying any reimbursement. No verbal communication nor is there a phone number for customer service!

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service. Impossible to speak to a person when you have a problem. Flight was rescheduled and changed several times. They changed the flight to Sept 12th when I went to check in on Sept 10th for my original flight departing at 9pm in Sept 11th. The email and website says new flight is Sept 12th at 2:26pm. On Sept 11th I go to check in for flight and find 5 emails saying they miscommunicated the date of the flight starting from 2am the morning of Sept 11th. It actually leaves on Sept 11th at 2:46pm. It was impossible to make it to the airport on such short notice. After trying to contact them for 5 hours so I finally booked a new flight. They are are refusing to comp the new booking even when they miscommunicated the new departure date. Horrible.

### "Last time I fly with Swoop"
Last time I fly with Swoop. The potential saving are minuscule compared to the potentially awful situation you may end up as a result of this company's absolute lack of customer service or the staff's care for others. As a result of this I am now stranded in Edmonton (instead of being in Ottawa). Going into the details would be lengthy and wouldn't paint a accurate picture anyway, but I will say that as I was instructed to go buy a new highly priced ticket at their counter, there were other people trying to resolve unrelated issues with Swoop. Seems like every time I've interacted with Swoop people have Major issues with it, this time it's me, and I must say, the way they handle things is enough for me to give up the Swoop savings. PS. I also learnt in the process today that they are not part of Star Alliance, which essentially means they can do what they want and not care about any quality, which from the looks of it is exactly the method they've adapted.

### "customer service is non existent"
Not Verified |  I needed to cancel my ticket within the first 24 hours and wanted to discuss my options with an agent. I spent an hour working with the bot trying to figure it out. So, frustrated I went to look for a phone number. No number on the site, and I had to Google it. The number rang forever, and finally got a machine that said not available to take calls. Sent an email, and was told 72 hour wait .. to cancel a ticket that has to be cancelled within 24 hours. Finally I bit the bullet and logged into my unused FB account in order to send a message. Because it took more than 24 hours. I was told No refunds, you either fly, or we will still take your money. You can't change flights for a fee or cancel for a fee. The customer service is non existent.

### "Last flight with Swoop for us"
Always delayed. Last flight with Swoop for us. It’s a bargain that will cost you time so just do yourself a favour and fly any other airline. It’s not worth the headache.

### "Steer clear of this airline"
Not Verified |  If booking with this airline, make sure you've got everything in order! Even in the midst of covid they dont do anything for their customers. Sorry, nothing I can do is what you'll hear, they'll take your money and no even that sorry or a cheeky thank you. The story is with my booking for last December. Still deep in covid. Change of plans means fend for yourself. A week before the flight I try to call and cancel. I'd gladly pay a cancelation charge but there was no option. I hear "I cannot cancel the flight, there's nothing I can do" This is after trying literally for HOURS. Over the course of 3 days. They must have only 1 guy I their call center. Their no refunds or cancelation policy has to change. Tried to cancel a week before, I get NOTHING, they take my money and nothing. Steer clear of this airline.

### "We were stranded in Kelowna"
Not Verified | Our flight from Kelowna to Toronto was cancelled. No offer for another flight, could not get a hold of anyone to speak to. We were stranded in Kelowna and it cost my husband and I an additional $1600 and a layover to get back home the following day. This is an absolute disgrace and they should not even be allowed to fly. I will never fly Swoop or will I ever recommend Swoop to anyone

### "expect a worse case scenario"
This has been the worst experience with an airline I’ve ever had. I purchased tickets through Swoop for my families vacation. We are travelling from Victoria to Toronto and chose Swoop because the airfare seemed to be a good price. However, once you purchase your ticket you find out that a carry on bag is not included, we were travelling with a family of 3 and had to pay an additional $300 approx. to bring a carry on! Not checked bag. This defeated the point of purchasing with Swoop. They cancelled our flight less than 24 hours before take off due to unscheduled maintenance. the only options were to select a Westjet flight that didn’t leave anywhere near the same time. Our original flight was scheduled to leave at 9:50AM and arrive in Toronto at 5:30 PM… the earliest flight offered was leaving Victoria at 6:40 PM, arriving in Toronto the next day at 6:00 Am. Our original flight was direct, the replacement had a stop with 3 hour layover. Arriving to our destination a day later caused us to have to reschedule our car rental, our hotel which we are out of pocket $ We have one less day for our family holiday and the inconvenience to have to reschedule the entire week with our extended family. My time is valuable and I had scheduled my time off work where now I have lost wages for a day I could have been working. To add to it, you can’t get ahold of any customer service agents. They have a messenger service which response was that an agent would get back to me in 72 hours. I will never support this business again and anyone who books with Swoop should expect a worse case scenario. I wish I would have read the reviews first.

### "expensive airline for an economy airline"
Swoop is an expensive airline for an economy airline. All of the extras soon add up. Despite this I am not leaving a bad review. I enjoyed my flight home. Much better than the flight out on a 737 Max. We had paid for extra leg room on both flights but the 737-800 had way more leg room than the Max. The flight attendants on both routes were fantastic but I have to say that on the return flight they were magnificent. So helpful and friendly they were a credit to their profession. The choice of food for a 4 hour flight could have been much better but we were prepared and had eaten before our flight. We did get some snacks that were expensive, but again we were prepared for that. The seats were more comfortable on the 737-800 than the Max. We will fly Swoop again but won’t pay for the carry on bags as we were told they would have been free. We will try to get our money back for the carry on bags but if we don’t it’s the cost of a lesson learned.

### "Will never use Swoop again"
Booked round trip direct flight tickets 4 months in advance. Checked in online at exactly 24 hours before flight. 10 hours later (14 hours before flight) received an email from Swoop that flight was cancelled for "Unplanned Maintenance". Was heading on family vacation for a week with an AirBnb booked (which is no longer refundable), as well as non-refundable baseball tickets and attraction tickets paid for. The email included an option to rebook with West Jet but the only options were 15 hour travel time flights with 2 stops (vs the 2h55m direct flight). We also would arrive 1 day later, so also lose a night of our vacation. Tried getting through to them on both their phone and messenger but call center already closed and simply no response on the messenger service after a full hour. Ended up going to the airport. Found out their "unplanned maintenance" was simply regular maintenance they simply did not get completed by the deadline, according to a Swoop pilot that was at the West Jet counter trying to rebook his flights. And the West Jet agent nodded in confirmation as it also impacted 5 West Jet planes. How is that unplanned maintenance when it was regular maintenance they simply didn't complete when they were supposed to? And why do the passengers pay for their mistake?? Ended up paying a ridiculous amount to fly with another airline and arrive 5 hours later than planned. Prices with Swoop are great but they mean nothing if all their flights are cancelled. Will never use Swoop again.

### "lost count of the changes to my flight"
I lost count of the changes to my flight. In the end, I list a full day off my trip. When I had to reach them their phone message actually said they were not answering calls. Westjet should be ashamed. You can’t run an airline with bots.

### "hope to get the return flight refunded"
On March 14, 2022 my wife and I booked our flight from Hamilton to Halifax July 31, return August 9th, to celebrate our 50th Wedding Anniversary. Our boarding passes were confirmed July 30th at 6.53pm. A little more than 4 hrs later we got a Flight cancellation notice due to "Operational Reasons". At 11:02pm the night before we leave for a completely booked vacation. My wife had already gone to bed, but I had not. At 1:05 am another email; "Please select "Options" below for next steps, including booking your new flight ... Your flight options include WestJet flights, subject to availability. Note that if you choose a WestJet flight, the booking cannot be cancelled or changed. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have ample time to check in and board the WestJet flight. At 1:15am (Do they really expect people to be up at that time?) travellers may also book a flight on WestJet from Toronto (YYZ) to Halifax (YHZ) in order to reach their final destination. Said 'option' involved flying from Hamilton to Calgary, and a five hour layover. Now a two hour flight becomes 19 hours. How can that be considered a viable option? And that flight to Halifax from Calgary was cancelled. We cancelled, and received a refund for the cancelled flight and were lucky to book thru Flair for the next day, at double the price. And we had to eat the charges for the hotel booked for the missed day - $330. And we'll have to hope to get the return flight refunded - It was too difficult to fly out of Waterloo and back to Hamilton. And from what I can find out that flight never happened.

### "I will not be flying Swoop again"
Swoop changed our flights multiple times and shaved almost three days off our trip. We had a direct flight but had to stop in Calgary to refuel and it took a very long time. There were no outlets to charge our phones on the plane and the food and service wasn’t great. I will not be flying Swoop again.

### "I am a loyal customer going forward"
I have flown with Swoop now 3 times. I love Swoop!!! Their staff are not only courteous but they had us laughing as well. On our trip into Charlottetown I made a special request for a Stompin Tom Connors song to be played. Bud the Spud - sounds silly but they played it once we landed. This airline has had bad reviews and for the life of me I can't figure out why. Swoop - I am a loyal customer going forward. Thank you for telling the passengers we were important to you. That in itself made a huge difference to me. P.S. love the pink!

### "Avoid this airline at all costs"
Booked a flight from Hamilton to Edmonton only to have it cancelled just hours before departure. At the airport, no Swoop staff could be found. Third party staff was hired to deal with the customers, they didn’t help us book another flight, only offered a travel voucher to hire a cab to Toronto and hope to book a flight either through Swoop or WestJet. They assured me that I would get fully reimbursed, I also followed the guidelines given on the cancellation email to book with Swoop or WestJet, they provided me a link to submit receipts for reimbursement. I submitted all necessary documents, waited 31 days for a decision only to find out that my claim isn’t eligible for compensation due to rest times for the staff. I am out over $1900. I can’t afford this, I was lied to. Avoid this airline at all costs.

### "Overpriced stressful experience"
Not Verified |  Overpriced stressful experience, will never book with Swoop again. Do yourself a favour, you’ll save money in the long run if you book elsewhere. Even Swoops cancelation policy is silliness.

### "not worth the added stress"
Not Verified |  Chances of cancellations or long delays are extremely common. If these issues arise, good luck getting in contact with customer service via any of their contact forms. My first flight was cancelled and my return flight was delayed (in addition the online check in service did on work). The customer service responded to me via instagram of all places 3 days after my expected flight which was cancelled. We managed to get another flight out to our destination with no help from swoop as we were not able to get a hold if them. Despite they owe us for the canceled flight i have not heard back about any refund. And the return flight was not smooth sailing, first the online checking service is not working. Had to wait for the check in service to open in which they seemed clueless and use to complaints with the airline but have no actual solutions. Then the flight was consistently delayed, first 5 min, then 20 min then 1 hour and eventually 2 hours delayed. This airline is a a big scam and is not worth the added stress. Do yourself a favour and fly with someone else. They dont know how to resolve issues and deal with customers.

### "We will never fly with Swoop again"
Not Verified |  I purchased return tickets through Swoop to get to Winnipeg from Hamilton. The flight there went smoothly. It was on the return that it all went downhill and my family of five was left stranded in Winnipeg for two extra days. I received a an email the day before our flight notifying us that our flight was cancelled due to "operational reasons" We tried desperately to get in touch with Swoop but were not successful. You can't reach anyone by phone, the voicemail tells customers to contact them via there facebook, twitter or instagram accounts. All of my emails to Swoop bounced back! There are frustrated comments from customers all over their Instagram account asking for responses to their inquiries. All of these social media services operate on an automated system so we were unsuccessful in getting our questions answered. The next day we drove to the airport and no one was at the Swoop counter. We asked West Jet to help us because West Jet owns Swoop airlines. They told us that they could not and that we would have to wait for another email from Swoop with instructions. We received an email with flight options which were: Option 1, fly the next day and take three different flights to get to Hamilton for a total of 18 hours of travel Option 2, fly two days later and take two flights to get home for a total of 8 hours of travel There were direct flights flying from Winnipeg to Hamilton both of those days but we could not get in touch with anyone to help. I would like consumers to know that Swoop leaves customers stranded and there are no instructions for any kind of compensation. We had to pay for two extra nights in a hotel, extra car rental fees and food expenses for a family of five. We also missed two days of work. We ended up spending twice as much with too much added stress then if we had booked with a reputable airlines. We will never fly with Swoop again and strongly feel that the public should be made aware that booking with Swoop is a mistake. I also feel that our government should be protecting consumers against airlines that operate this way.

### "Be prepared to lose your money"
Wanted to change my reservation for my flight that was to fly today, August 3, 2022, however, could not reach any staff to assist since this past Saturday- a total of 5 days. Tried messenger, Facebook, email & phone. No way to reach an actual person. Had purchased Modifly and would have changed my flight to next year same time but flights are not posted that far out, hence, I was trying to contact staff that could help. (Was flying to see my mom but she died 5 days before my flight, want to use flight for Celebration of Life next year, same time - on her birthday.) Be prepared to lose your money with this company. No way to reach anyone to help. If you want to change your flight & you purchased Modifly to do so, be aware that you can only rebook 6 months later or so, which is not indicated anywhere in the fine print. Also, your flight must be between the same two points. Very disappointed with Swoop this time around. I flew with Swoop in February 2020 just before Covid - was perfect for me then - got me where I needed to be cheaply, safely. No frills at all though - best for fit, able bodied people - don't expect much comfort.

### "the airline staff are quite pleasant and friendly"
With all the bad press the airlines are getting these days it was so great to experience a flight that was on time with no line ups, issues or otherwise. This is the second time we've flown Swoop and we have found that the airline staff are quite pleasant and friendly. Sure they're a budget airline but if you're flight is 4 hours or less, you don't really need much else other than a relatively comfortable seat.

### "cheap but they don't deliver"
Trash of a company without basic sense of responsibility and commitment to customers. They cancelled my family trip to Florida a few days before departure and didn't bother to provide an acceptable solution. Their "customer service" put me on hold for 40 minutes and then blew me off with pathetic excuses and tried to send me away with other phone numbers to call for assistance. Never deal with this company, look for better travel options. They are cheap but they don't deliver.

### "I don't recommend Swoop"
Not Verified |  On my way back from a 2 week stay in Florida, I arrived at the airport around 5 AM. My flight was at 8:20 Am, or at least it was supposed to be. We sat on the plane for around 2 hours before we were told we had to disembark the aircraft. The reason was unscheduled maintenance on a tire. They had the tire all ready to be changed but Swoop made the terrible decision to drive a guy in from Tampa (because it was cheaper). All the passengers (including me) sat in the terminal until 5 PM then Swoop cancelled the flight. It was extremely stressful but the flight attendants were amazing people! I don't recommend Swoop to anyone.

### "no way to speak to a live person"
Not Verified |  There is no way to speak to a live person ever. This leaves you to try email, no response for 3 days a bot on messenger if you have Facebook which I don’t want. Tried to deal through Westjet AS the owner of swoop, they say they can do nothing for anyone pertaining to Swoop. Even Westjet couldn’t give me a number to call to speak to a live person.

### "recommend everyone avoid them"
Terrible customer service! I tried booking a flight from Hamilton to Halifax and after I booked the flight my itinerary said the flight was from Toronto to Halifax. I cancelled the flight immediately, expecting a full refund, as they have a cancelation policy where you're supposed to get a full refund if you cancel within 24 hours. It has been a month and a half and I still have not seen a single cent back. The bot is useless and it is impossible to get into contact with a human. I won't be booking with swoop ever again, and I recommend everyone avoid them.

### "least bit interested in helping"
Try to get an answer to an important concern. I made so many attempts via chat bot, email as well as within Swoop's site. Wasted a tremendous amount of time, and worst of all, not a single reply. Even at the airport, the agent was cold and not the least bit interested in helping. It was a simple question. The issue in this case was that our original booking had 2 outbound and 2 inbound seats chosen from Toronto to Halifax and back. After Swoop changed the scheduled flight, we ended up with only 3 seats instead of the original 4 that had been paid for. It's now over a week. The bot cannot provide anything remotely close to a correct answer, online customer service simply gives 2 generic messages, apologizing for how busy they are currently or, if the answer can be found online, they will not respond to your query. I'm inclined to say that I'm not alone in my disappointment.

### "Horrible booking system"
Not Verified |  Horrible booking system, charges an additional $200+ to switch flights despite paying for flight insurance. Kind of redundant and sneaky when dealing the pandemic. This company needs to put their priorities in check and they need put more effort towards keeping customers happy.

### "Flight attendants did not enforce mask rule"
Flight delayed twice and then switched from a direct flight to Toronto to a refuelling stop in Calgary. The pilot explained that the Kelowna runway was under construction and too short for a fully fuelled plane to take off. Beware for the upcoming months as this is unlikely to change! We were offered a free glass of water as compensation. Flight attendants did not enforce mask rule. In fact, the head attendant was wearing his incorrectly (nose uncovered). Some of us still care about public safety.

### "a disappointing experience"
A friend of mine booked a flight to Saskatoon for his family to visit us for a week from Toronto. Accordingly, we booked hotels and rented a vehicle to travel to Alberta. The ticket was confirmed today at 10:00 am by Swoop airlines. He then received the attached cancellation email at 12:30 pm. It has been a disappointing experience for both of our families. Swoop airlines will never be a part of our travel plan.

### "tell me my mask isn't approved"
I'm about to board the plane and they tell me my mask isn't approved. Why wouldn't they deny me the multiple times I entered the airport and went through security. Secondly they say "you're not getting on with that mask", so I say ok can you give me an approved one. And they don't have any, and just kept saying I'm not getting on. luckily a guy walking by gave me one out of his bag. What a joke this airline is, they didn't even try to help me.

### "the worst airline in the world"
Not Verified |  Swoop is the worst airline in the world. One and a half-hours late leaving, they cancelled my return flight and stranded me 800 miles from home. When I got to the airport to try to find an alternative airline, there were 8 Swoop employees standing behind their counter talking and doing nothing. I asked one of them to help me to find the next Swoop flight home - she refused and directed me to her male colleague, who refused to help me. Kept saying: "Look at our website". I told him that I had no intention of looking at any website, since 8 Swoop employees were standing in front of me doing nothing, and they had instant access to their computer systems! He refused to help me.

### "such a bad service"
Swoop is such a bad service. Our flight was supposed to take off from Toronto at 1:10pm. we had to wait since 9.30 am, 4 hrs in the line just for check in and they did checked at around 2 pm after 4 hrs standing but without our checked in baggage. When they checked in our bags, they said it would reach to plane and to run and catch the flight and they knew it was not going to reach and they purposely told us to run and catch the flight and now we are at Vegas without anyone taking responsibility for our baggage. Swoop airlines does not have any even have a line where we can call.

### "I would give them zero rating if I could"
Not Verified |  We had a round trip tickets from Abbotsford to Ottawa through Calgary for Friday, July 8 and return back home on Monday, July 11. First, flight to Ottawa got cancelled and we rebooked a flight through WestJet (option given by Swoop) for Saturday. Things could happen. Unexpected, unpleasant events started on Sunday, July 10 with E-mail from Swoop that our flight on Monday is cancelled. Using link, we got through e-mail to book flight back through West Jet didn't help at all. Whichever option we tried and most importantly whichever day we tried, we couldn't book any flight back home. Message was: in the same day you need to have more than 2 hours overlay. Even though we picked the least desirable option with 2 layovers and more than 3 hours wait at the Toronto and Calgary airports, we were getting the same message. And, we tried for every single day from Monday July 11 until Monday July 18. Calling Swoop phone umber, message we always getting was: we are unable to talk to you at this time, contact us by social media. Contacting Swoop through social media (Facebook/messenger) we were added to their que. The funniest part is that we got message back from a virtual assistant on Thursday, July 14. Contacting them by e-mail, message of acknowledgement is that they have received my e-mail is only e-mail we got from them until now, July 17. My wife had to perform already scheduled surgeries on Tuesday, July 12 what put us out of the options and we had to but her a ticket through Air Canada. Trying to save some money, I flew back using Flair, on Tuesday, July 12. Conclusion: after spending extra $1,800 on 2 tickets from Ottawa to Vancouver, driving to Abbotsford to pick-up car at the airport since flights back were to Vancouver airport, one extra day I had to use away from work, unpleasant time in Ottawa spending more than 10 hours in attempt to contact Swoop, anxiety and frustration with not having ability to contact Swoop, our planned trip as surprise for our friends was a disaster. I will try whatever I can to get reimbursed for extra ticket we had to pay and for intangible damages caused by Swoop. Please, read this comment before you book any flight with swoop. I would give them zero rating if I could.

### "Gave us the run around"
Never fly with them. They made us wait for more than 2 hours today then canceled our flights. The ground staff were not helpful. Gave us the run around. It was pretty much on your own. They are not willing to help passengers rebook a flight or provide hotel accommodations. We incurred cost for hotel and car rental at Las Vegas and dont know if we will get the money back. This airline should be shut down.

### "Buyer Beware"
Victoria to Las Vegas. Purchased flights to Vegas in November 2021, arrived at YYJ on Feb 24, 2022 to board our flight to find no Swoop personnel in the airport. Ask Airport staff and were told there was no such flight. Called Swoop and although on hold for over 2.5 hrs, no one picked up the phone. Checked options and found only Air Canada had a flight to Vegas that day thru Calgary. Purchased last minute and got economy to Calgary and were forced to buy Business Class to Vegas. Total for two tickets was just over $3200.00. At no time were we notified of the Flight Cancellation or given options. Swoop personnel showed up later just prior to out Air Canada flight and apologized profusely and indicated I would have to resort to social media to talk with someone. I did just that and got no one that I could talk to personally. Just BOT replies and no justification. Further, once in Las Vegas had to fight to get our way home. Once home, have tried numerous times to talk with someone at Swoop and as of today, July 16/2022 still have not had any personal communication with anyone at Swoop. Just BOT replies over social media. Not one return phone call, been on hold for over 4hrs at times and still no one answers! Buyer Beware!

### "I will never fly Swoop or WestJet again"
Not Verified |  Stranded in Las Vegas, Two cancelled flights, Added Hotel and food costs. Due to extended delay I missed my flight from Edmonton to Regina as I'm still in Vegas, Will need to book new Flight if I ever get back to Edmonton. One way to Regina is now $600. Added extra cost surpassing $1000 and counting. I will never fly Swoop or WestJet again.

### "I had a horrible experience"
I had a horrible experience with Swoop. I missed my flight and was stranded in Toronto for days. I needed to check in an extra bag for my daughter and I was delayed at the counter until I missed boarding my flight by 2 minutes even after paying twice for the same bag. There was no empathy from any staff and was not put on another flight, I literally stayed at the airport from 6am to 7pm pleading for assistance on rescheduling but no one helped. The customer service is terrible and I was treated  badly, they concluded that missing my flight was my fault. I will never recommend them to anyone despite the cheap fares.

### "not eligible for any compensation"
Not Verified |  I travelled from the Dominican Republic to Toronto last month, I was supposed to flight at 3:10 pm, arriving at Toronto at 7:50 pm, but, we received an email from the airline saying that they've changed the flight schedule, thus we will be flying at 9:21 pm, arriving at 1:55 am at Pearson airport. Furthermore, I finally took off the airport of Punta Cana at 10:20 pm, arriving at Pearson airport at 2:20 pm, despite the delay, they left us one hour inside the plane before we can get off the plane without any explanation, and we were banned to stand up inside the plane, not even for go to the bathroom, any person who tried to go to the bathroom was ordered to sit down during that period of time, (1 hour). As a result of this unfortunate situation, I was finally out of the airport at 3;15 am, and had to pay an hotel room for that night, because it was too late for me, and I live three hours away from Toronto. Finally, when the delay occurred, I received an email from the airline which established that I may be eligible to receive a compensation due the situation, so I proceeded to submit a formal complaint to swoop about that situation, but, they rejected under the argument that the flight was not delayed from more than three hours, it was not eligible for any compensation.

### "will never use them again"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline - will never use them again. Arranged for a wheelchair for 90 yr old Mother - they told her to use her walker and made her walk 15 mins to the gate! She was exhausted and in pain! Why would the staff be that cruel when it is easy to see she cannot walk on her own. Then 2 days before she was to return she ended up in hospital with an infection. Tried to call, email, use their 24/7 chat line multiple times but they would not answer or respond. Called Expedia whom I booked the Swoop ticket through, and they were useless as well. Neither would help or respond and so I just lose the $ for the return ticket I guess - they don't seem to care.

### "What a scam of an airline"
Not Verified |  I never even made it for the actual travel. This is pre travel. Bought tickets over 2 months ago for $275.00 return from Ottawa to Vancouver. Got a TGTBT deal but since it was through Google Flights I did it. Received an email 2 weeks before departing letting me know my flight had been canceled. I was given the option to cancel or change to a date they chose, 5 days after my original departure which meant I would be staying 2 days instead of 7. I called the agency I bought the tickets with and the agent told me those prices didn’t exist that the real price would be 1600.00 but she would give me a 50.00 discount each flight. The only caveat was I needed to fly in to another city and then take a water taxi “for only $150.00 more each way” I would still be saving a lot of money. I was flabbergasted and told her to then cancel the entire trip to which she told me I needed to call Swoop directly. I did so, was on the cue at 147, waited for over 3 hrs and when I reached #25 on the cue it just suddenly cut me off. What a scam of an airline!

### "not worth the few bucks you save"
Not Verified |  Terrible customer service. I purchased cancellation insurance (CHUBB policy) and was not able to take the flight. Had to wait until after the flight days had passed before I could apply for a refund. After unsuccessfully trying to register my refund request on their pathetic customer service website, I waited about 6 hours on the phone until finally an agent said I had to complete a 'Message' request - he couldn't help me? Now been 3 weeks and nothing from Swoop. Here I am back on their live agent chat 'in the cue' waiting yet again for an agent. Never booking with Swoop again - not worth the few bucks you save!

### "Customer service was dismal"
Not Verified |  Recently booked with Swoop to go to Edmonton for a family wedding. Prior to departure, we had four flight time changes - the final one was a flight cancellation. Many passengers in my family were booked and had to scramble to get there. This is not acceptable if you have work commitments, child and pet arrangements etc.. Return flight also revised four times. Flight finally confirmed and seat assigned. Eight hours before the flight it was cancelled. Options were very limited. Customer service was dismal. This is not acceptable. Frankly myself and my large family will never book with Swoop again, disgusting customer service, reliability and commitment. It’s dangerous, stress inducing and not acceptable!

### "Unbelievably poor service"
Not on board at all, didn’t even get on the plane. My kids were denied boarding in Moncton. This was a scheduled visit and I haven’t seen my kids in over a year. Didn’t save any money as there was no refund and it cost more to book a flight so late with a real airline. Zero customer service, that “bot” is useless. This is the biggest scam going. Unfortunately I booked return with these idiots, probably no refund for that either as I will not fly with this so called airline. It’s July 2, the return is not until August 15th. I expect a full refund as that is plenty of advanced cancellation time. Unbelievably poor service.

### "Not worth saving a few $"
Not Verified |  Penny fool pound wise. Checked in online, no baggage, only carry on. Would not print boarding pass. Now in queue with others 1Q for l those with and without baggage. Like many will miss flight. Great demonstration of logistics stupidity. Being a spin off of WestJet expected this they could have planned. Not worth saving a few $ on flight then face add ons plus add ons and now this.

### "poor communication and customer service2
Not Verified |  Avoid at all costs! Our friends were stranded for two days because their flight back home to Winnipeg from Ottawa was cancelled due to a "staff resources" issue. No hotels, meals, vouchers, or anything were offered and the next available flight was two days later! They went against their own policy saying they didn't have to pay anything out of offer accommodations because the flight cancellation was not their own fault. They later *changed* the reasoning for the cancellation (very suspicious) saying that the flight was stopped due to customs. Our friends visited the airport in person and the Swoop personnel literally said they couldn't do anything to help them and that "They weren't actually Swoop" and "Didn't actually work for Swoop". They told our friends to speak to Westjet instead! It was not possible to get through to them by phone or online. Extremely poor communication and customer service. If you visit their Instagram page, all the comments on their posts and customers demanding explanations.

### "no customer service at all"
Not Verified | Halifax to Hamilton. Canceled my flight with less than 8 hours notice except for the email - no customer service at all. No number no one to call no help at all. Very poor. Worst website I have every used no help at all.

### "worst experience I have ever had flying"
The worst experience I have ever had flying. And I have been travelling most of my adult life. This time was different though, I had my one year old daughter with me. What started out as Swoop airlines telling me I was at the wrong gate - turned into over $1400+ in expenses and damages in just a few hours. As I approached gate B5 at Toronto Pearson airport which was stated on my ticket where my flight would be - the service staff informed me that I was infact flying out of B25 instead. So, from there I pretty much ran pushing my daughter in the stroller approximately 15 mins across the airport. Once I reached B25 I was informed there that the flight I was trying to catch had already left. From there, I back tracked. Racing both my daughter and I back to B5. And what happens when I reach B5? I am denied boarding. They told me they called my name so many times that I can no longer board, I've missed my chance, as I watch the plane preparing to leave the gate. Keep in mind, my reason for flying is because I am relocating from Ontario to Saskatchewan. I have no family left and not many friends in Ontario. I am flying to Edmonton to meet my family. With my one year old daughter. I begin panicking, as someone who does infact suffer from major anxiety, I'm being told I can't catch my flight. At this point I'm told to sit down and they will help me. I'm crying uncontrollably when the supervisor approaches me. Telling me infront of the rest of the people waiting for other flights to "get it together" and "what example I am setting for my daughter" So now I'm being shamed by someone who has no compassion that a young mother who has been denied access to fly to my new home is over reacting? I'm sorry but if you were told to get it together and go home with nowhere to go how would you react? At this point some stranger came over to me and tried to calm me down. I couldn't stop crying and began having a panic attack. This went on for over an hour before they told me to go home and that they can do nothing for me. Not only blaming me for missing a flight I was prepared and waiting for but shaming me, calling me names and being far from decent. There was no compassion for someone who was told to go else where and then sent back to where I was originally was just for them to tell me that it was my fault? Telling me to go home but where do I go? No car, no house, no family. Just me and my daughter at this point it was midnight and I was left alone at the gate. The only person who showed me any decency was the security guards who helped me find my way out of the airport and over to the connecting hotel. The Sheraton. How is it fair that I had to check in to a hotel at 1am with my baby and be charged $545 for a single room from the hours of 130am until check out which was 11am that same morning? And not only that but I had to rebook with a different airline spending another $700 for an immediate ticket the next day.

### "the worst customer service"
Lost Baggage. It has been now almost 24 hours I’m still looking for my bag and no communication from Swoop or any agents to where the bag is. Swoop agent in SFB has no clue to where it is and even they cannot communicate with their own people in YYZ. I cannot believe that in 2022 such a pathetic service can exist. Tried calling but as usual line is busy. Way to go I nominate swoop for the worst customer service of the century.

### "making me never want to fly with them again"
I am currently on hold with Swoop (3 hours and counting) after booking a vacation for a wedding and a funeral. I received an email less than 48 hours before my flight saying that our flight has been cancelled. all the options are a nightmare (2 stops with a full 16 hour day of travels). We have two children and are having a hard time finding flights where we can sit with our underage children. I'm beyond stressed out that I may not be able to attend my nieces wedding, and if I want to it will cost me over 5000$ now. I have flown with Swoop in the past but this is making me never want to fly with them again. Our tickets were not cheap either, over 1500$ so I did not book a "cheap" flight, (staying in Canada). A vacation nightmare. A family feud. I'm so unimpressed.

### "I will never fly with them again!"
Not Verified |  They cancelled during the night our flight and they didn't have a flight until the next day. They didn't give us any compensation for the hotel and food spent because on the airplane ticket it apparently says they can cancel any flight within 12 hours! What a shame! I've never seen that before! I will never fly with them again!

### "Customer service does not exist with this airline"
King of delays, both flights were delayed. Customer service does not exist with this airline. Rude agents will not answer any questions or entertain any questions. One answer that is call customer service. Lost my bag and there is nobody who can help with that. Paid extra for service called MODIFLY but only customer service can do changes so if there is no customer service than you cannot do any changes and lose all the money. Service is total garbage.

### "Never will fly with them again"
Not Verified |  We booked 5 tickets for a funeral service, noticed we spelt the first name of one passenger wrong, phoned in, they said it would be $80 each way total of $160 to fix it. That’s more than the ticket was asked to speak to supervisor agent said they will say same thing. Supervisor came on or so he said he was said that’s your problem not mine, you made the mistake. I asked why so much to make a spelling change, he said you don’t understand it’s takes a lot to change. I said help me to understand why it’s so hard to change the spelling, he said I don’t have to explain it to you. What a way for a so called supervisor to talk to a passenger, guess that’s how they train their people to talk to passengers. Never will fly with them again.

### "There's no customer service at all"
If I could do a negative star review I would. I will never recommend this airline or fly it again. They canceled our flight and gave us options to revise our itinerary at no charge but the options were terrible. We accepted a red eye flight and then a few days later asked to cancel it for either a refund or credit. I've spent hours waiting to speak to someone on the phone. Their messenger app where you can "chat" with an agent uses a third party non Swoop customer care centre to manage these calls. There's no customer service at all, there's no options at all. Money down the toilet. Never again.

### "too slow for reroute options"
Flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues, emails were too slow for reroute options, ended up having to stay overnight in a hotel. Alternate flight was cancelled by parent company Westjet. The old saying does apply here, "you get what you pay for

### "biggest compliment for the crew"
Not Verified | Deer Lake to Hamilton. Flew Swoop from Hamilton, ON to Deer Lake, Newfoundland and back two weeks later. Everything was smooth, including both prior to the trips with communication, and during, with staff and services. Very happy that there is a reliable option to cut out the frills (meals, snacks, etc.) that shouldn't be automatic and included in a flight price. But my biggest compliment is for the crew, and one flight attendant in particular. I usually have terrible problems with my ears upon descent in flights. When I explained this to the flight attendant, and also that the way to alleviate this at least a little was to hold cups with boiling hot towels inside them over my ears (really! ), she was great about accommodating this and brought them to me without reminder. On the return trip, we happened to have the same flight attendant and when I flagged her down and reminded her of my story, she remember immediately and said not to worry. She brought the cups etc. to me at precisely the perfect time, which was a big help, as the descent into Hamilton was pretty painful. Thank you!

### "super impressed with Swoop"
I am super impressed with Swoop. I am retired now and recently booked a flight to Ont from NS on Flair. First and last time that will ever happen. On the way to the airport we received a text asking us if we wanted to take advantage of their free hotel offer. That came even before the cancellation notice. We then received the notice and an offer to move our flight to 4 days later for no charge. I cancelled the flight and called Swoop. What a 100% turn about and such a pleasant experience. We were served by Rae and if you even have the pleasure of meet her you will be in excellent hands. She was SO helpful and so kind. She made our day and got us on a flight at almost the same time the Flair flight was to leave. So was so understanding and so sympathetic to our situation. Her empathy was so welcome. What a breathe of fresh air when someone actually wants to help you and with a smile. Forget Flair and choose Swoop. You wont be disappointed you did.

### "all given wrong information"
Showed up at the airport with plenty of time, saw that our flight was pushed back. No problem. Waited in the gate indicated on my boarding pass. Then discovered that the gate on my boarding pass was wrong and then the the pushed back time was also wrong. The flight left without 4 of us because we were all given wrong information. Then was told by representatives that we shouldn't have assumed any of the incorrect info was correct. What?

### "Super disappointed in this airline"
Not Verified |  Bought 5 tickets to Edmonton and Swoop changed the flight 2 weeks before the departure date. So instead of my original 4 day trip, they shortened it to 3 and made the departure time super late. I already booked my car and hotel and am now not able to pickup the car on time and can't cancel that car. Also booked a hotel for 3 nights and now need to switch it to two and when I tried to call the number to speak with an agent, it wouldn't even go through. Super disappointed in this airline and would 1000% would not recommend anyone to go on it.

### "nickel and dime you"
Not Verified | Kelowna to Toronto. I’m on hold with customer service over 2 hours now, still waiting, this airline is garbage. The prices are cheap only to nickel and dime you for everything. Won’t be flying Swoop again.

### "would never recommend"
Not Verified | Hamilton to St. Johns. Absolutely garbage airline, would never recommend them to anyone, not worth the hassle. Terrible customer service. On hold for 4 hours for them only to lie about what was on their website.

### "terrible option for the average person"
I did not actually fly with Swoop as they made unreasonable changes to our flights and we ended up cancelling and booking with a more reputable airline. We originally booked a flight via credit card in January 2020 to travel in June 2020. After the flight got changed multiple times(different time of day and then to a completely different airport which was an hour and a half away) it was inevitably cancelled due to the pandemic. We were offered credits for the flight that would expire in 2 years which we took as that was the only option available at the time. We did not qualify for a refund as it was uncontrollable. Finally, this year we decided to book our trip again and use our credits. We booked 3 months ahead of our flight time. We were no longer able to fly out of the city we live in as Swoop was no longer offered at that airport so we booked our flight out of an airport 2 hours away. We also had to pay a little bit extra as flights were more expensive now. They changed our flight times 3 times since we booked. Same day but different times which is a little annoying but not the end of the world until today when we got the notification that our return flight had changed again, this time it was 2 full days after our original return date. For us, this is not an acceptable change as we are scheduled to leave in a week and a half. Our vacation time with work was already booked, our accommodations were booked and our car rental was booked. When this happens, they give you the option to accept the changes, make your own changes or cancel and receive a refund in the form of the original payment. I contacted them on social media asking if I could receive a full refund to my credit card and they said no. Since this flight was booked using mostly credits, I could only receive another credit to my account but I would receive the additional money I spent(since the flights for more expensive than our original booking) on my credit card. I fought with them a bit on this because I don't really want credit towards an airline I never intend to use again due to the complete uncertainty of the flights themselves but the answer was still no. They put the onus completely on the passenger to change their whole schedule around every single little change they make. They make it incredibly difficult to make your own changes but they are allowed to make several unreasonable changes. Not everybody can just add 2 extra days to their vacation no problem or just fly out of a completely different airport. And it's not like they offered to pay for any additional costs this would incur for accomodations, car rentals or travelling to & from the airport. They trap you and then pretend like they offered you a reasonable solution. If you are a person who is okay with last minute changes and can afford to be loosey-goosey with your dates, times and airports, maybe Swoop is the right airline for you but in my opinion, they are a terrible option for the average person.

### "Not a great customer service experience"
Our experience with swoop isn't the best going back to Edmonton. We lost our baggage and the staff around 1am June 7 told us that she wasn't able to notice the baggage since she’s caught up with another issue in one of the oversized baggage. She was about to ask me to fill out a form for the missing baggage, I told her if she could check it properly with other staff because we put our medications in the baggage. She doesn't have that sense of urgency to do whatever a staff should do with the client. So since I told her that we cant go him without it. She tried to call other staff and she was advice that they got our luggage. Not a great customer service experience.

### "would not recommend this airline"
Not Verified | So, being a discount airlines, they do not issue refunds or provide any cancellation policy. I found this no cancellation thing after over 5 hours on hold only to find what seemed like just 1 guy in the call center and after saying I want to cancel due to covid issues on both sides and he tells me "I can't help you". What!? So after all this they kept my $4000 and provided nothing! Not even a way to cancel. I had a good flight in 2021, no issues. In COVID times forget it. They don't think about their customers, just the dollar signs that you provide. I would not recommend this airline! Steer clear!

### "having my mask just below my nose"
Never in my life have I stepped onto a plane and been threatened with the prospect of a travel ban for having my mask just below my nose. Earlier this week the WestJet (who owns Swoop) CEO said that these silly mandates imposed by the Federal Liberals need to be removed. This Flight Attendant proceeded to introduce the flight to the passengers by issuing the same threat and how that we are still in a Pandemic. She said that if you're sleeping and the mask is just below your nose you'll be woken up and threatened with a ban if it's a two time offense. I will continue to give Swoop a chance to earn my business but this one Flight Attendant has zero business being a customer facing ambassador to the brand.

### "cancelation policies are trash"
Swoop is absolutely garbage. Their cancelation policies are trash. Same with re-booking. They are unwilling to work with customers or compromise. They say they are an ultra low airline yet have rhe exact same pricing as their sister airline, West jet? If I could give a negative star rating, I would.

### "Customer service is very poor"
When I got off my hour flight, my suitcase was damaged. This was a brand new suitcase I put in a claim at the airport and was told someone would get back to me in a couple days, no one did I sent an email regarding this and still no one replied. Customer service is very poor

### "never book with this airline"
Not Verified | Do yourself a favour and never book with this airline. At 28 years old, this is the first time I have ever felt compelled to write a review about a company because they are just that terrible. They cancelled my flight due to COVID-19, which is understandable but refused to give me a refund. Instead, they offered Swoop credits that expire within a year. Problem is, they also stopped flying out of the city I am located in so not only would I have to pay more than double the price but I would have to fly out of an airport 2 hours away. When asking for a refund to my original form of payment it took 35 days for them to respond! At worst I was hoping to get my Swoop credits extended, but by contacting customer service (if you can call it that) you will be on hold for a minimum of 2.5 hours.

### "From start to end, nothing but problems and hassles"
Not Verified |  From start to end, nothing but problems and hassles, service is the worst, the hostesses treat you with disrespect and stress the fact that they are not there to serve you but to control you, very rude and the team leader was sitting down and stuffing her face all the time like she was in first class. The plane arrived at 1am from Vegas and now it is 2.2am and our luggage hasn't arrived nor has the belt started turning. Please, pay the extra money and save you dignity and avoid this garbage.

### "Absolutely horrible"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible. Had our flight delayed then canceled and overhear staff say it was due to them not having a pilot because the one they had had worked too long. Then their service people used terms like “not our problem” when guests asked questions. We then had to wait 3+ hours to get our luggage back to us (that was never put on the plane). I will never fly with this airline again. Basically this ate up a whole day of our vacation we’ve been waiting over 2 years to take due to covid. Thanks, Swoop, you’re the worst!

### "Were told could board without the luggage"
Flight was at 1245. Arrived at the counter at 1204 and told that we could not board with our luggage as the counter was closed, even though there were 3 swoop employees there and no other customers at the small Abbotsford airport. Were told could board without the luggage. Opted not to board as would be away for a week with no clothes etc. Called Swoop twice. Hung up after on hold for 1.5 hrs then next day called and was on hold for 2.5 hours Was told that no refunds nor a credit for the return flight would be issued. Asked to be transferred to someone higher and was told that they were the higher resolution department and were answering phones as they were extremely busy. (wonder why they are having so many phone calls of complaints). Not impressed with their handling of the entire matter. The on line flight tracker shows the plane departed at 1231, 14 minutes early. Possibly the real reason they did not want to accommodate boarding with luggage as they wanted to leave early. If your looking for a stress free enjoyable interaction with an airline do not choose SWOOP.

### "Delayed over and over again"
Not Verified |  Delayed over and over again, until there was almost no point in flying. Waste of money, waste of time. Cheap flights don't need comfy seats or service, but they need to actually fly.

### "Not a great (first) experience with Swoop"
Received 24hr check-in notification from Swoop, able to check in, to receive a notification that my flight would be delayed three hours due "Scheduled Maintenance". Because it was less than 24hrs and after hours no business centre is available to inquire about flight changes, and then in the morning was told it is under the 24hrs and no destination changes are permitted. Was further told that no other local airports have no other times, yet co-worker was flying out that afternoon from a neighbouring airport. Will be missing my business meeting. Not a great (first) experience with Swoop and will not be using them in the future.

### "turned away and not able to fly"
Not Verified |  Had the hardest time booking a flight on their website. At the airport I was turned away and not able to fly to my destination because of a lack of antigen test. Customer rep was so rude and told me to go home. I’ve had 3 vaccinations and explained how their website kept crashing during the booking. They didn’t care. I lost all my hotel money and can’t get in touch with Swoop to discuss situation. Spent yesterday on hold for 6 hours and nothing.

### "deep lack of respect for their paying customers"
I can't express enough how terrible my treatment has been with the trip I am currently. I may be forced to cancel the entire thing and return home with a more reasonable airline. I noticed the day before departure that both of my flights were moved to a day earlier than originally booked. Naturally, this was very disruptive to all of my plans, and impossible to work around for my return trip. I did not receive any email notifying me of this change and have checked every corner of my inbox thoroughly. I also purchased their Modifly option for flight flexibility, but it turns out that this only covers the switching fee and not any differences in fares. I have now been engaged in a long chat with their customer service team, starting at 11:50am, it is now past 5pm and they have still not helped me. Sometimes message responses come after 20 minutes of silence from them. They allege that I confirmed the changes (I, of course, did not) and have not provided any evidence of their allegations. They are also unwilling to change my flight back to it's original date, They say I can make the change using my ModiFly add-on, but I will still be charged the difference in fare. I argue that I should not be charged to fly on the date of my original booking, especially given that I never confirmed the change. I have not complained about all their other flaws. I am not even requesting a refund. I simply want to fly home on the date that I booked. Instead I am being asked to pay again! Poor treatment, slow responses, and aloof attitudes from their costumer service representatives shows a deep lack of respect for their paying customers.

### "I subsequently had to leave the flight"
Not Verified |  Upon entering their aircraft last week, I had a coffee in my hand, and was holding 2 other bags - one over my shoulder and one in the opposite hand. I had been sipping from the drink and thus, my mask was temporarily down, below my mouth. As I approached the flight attendants, one of them told me to pull my mask up. He was rude when he spoke to me. I politely told him that I was drinking, and that neither of my hands were free because I was holding my bags and my drink. He responded "you are not actively drinking now, so pull your mask back up. I nodded and said "OK" and pulled my mask up, covering my mouth and nose, and went to take my seat. About 5 minutes later, the same flight attendant approached me while I was in my seat. My mask was pulled up over my mouth and nose. Once again, he spoke to me in a rude manner. He said "is there something you don't understand about your mask? I answered "no," and he proceeded to tell me that I had "already been a problem" and he threatened me by stating "if you continue to be a problem, I will have you removed from this flight. I reminded him that when he had initially approached me, I was sipping from my drink and neither of my hands were free, and that these were the reasons that my mask was temporarily down and I was not able to immediately pull it back up. During the entire time he spoke to me, I had my mask pulled up over my mouth and nose. After he spoke with me, I took another sip of my drink, and then once again pulled my mask up over my mouth and nose. Without warning, this flight attendant approached me again and told me that he needed to remove me from the flight. When I asked him why, he told me it was because of "mask compliance. I reminded him that he had warned me previously about my mask, and that after that point, I had kept my mask pulled up over my mouth and nose the entire time. He continued to speak in a rude, pushy and condescending manner, and insisted that I had "violated mask compliance. When I asked him for evidence he responded with "I saw you. I politely reminded him that my mask was pulled up over my mouth and nose, and that I had followed his instructions the entire time since he gave me the instructions. He continued to tell me that I had "not followed his instructions"; this is an outright LIE. He also mentioned that he "did not feel safe" on the aircraft with me, which does not make sense given the fact that I had my mask over my mouth and nose for the entire time that he spoke to me. He condescendingly asked me "did you forget to read the rules and regulations of this aircraft when you bought your ticket? , an unnecessary comment that seemed to be made only in order for him to be even more disrespectful towards me. I subsequently had to leave the flight.

### "there was no help from Swoop"
Terrible counter customer service. My first impression with SWOOP has been a disaster. While travelling from Toronto to Edmonton, we were left stranded (family of 5) along with 20 other passengers. We had checked in online for our boarding passes but we bought 2 checked luggage options which required to be dropped off at the counter. If we had not done this, I probably would not be writing this negative review but I would be running naked in Downtown Edmonton for 10 days! Or flight was at 7am, we were at the airport at 5.20am. They do not have a bag drop-off counter, instead they made us line up. There were too many passengers for 2 customer agents, which later turned to 4 but it was too late. We were at the counter at 6am, that is a 1 hour delay. Their flight supervisor checked us in. There was no indication from her that we were late for our flight. TSA only made matters worse, they delayed us another hour. However, there was no help from Swoop, no announcement, no agent was sent out to help us get through the line at all. By the time we showed up at the gate, the flight was closed, and were left stranded along with another 22 passengers with no help at all other than a card for the customer service department. We managed to book ourselves on a later flight with Flair Airlines but it meant spending an additional $1700 that was unplanned for. I am extremely disappointed with Swoop!

### "thank her again for all her help"
I had a problem with my return flight to Edmonton. I tried to correct it on line and no go. I went to airport in Kelowna and talked to someone at the counter. They called the supervisor Martyne and she was very helpful. She helped me rebook a flight home and found me the best price. Martyne went way beyond and above to help me solve my problems. I want to thank her again for all her help. A very treasured Employee.

### "has always been a pleasant experience"
I’ve flown Swoop several times now (mostly Kelowna-Toronto routes) and it has always been a pleasant experience. I’m glad there’s an option to fly to Kelowna direct. This being said, this is a budget, low cost airline… as long as you’re aware that this will come with its set of challenges and painpoints, you shouldn’t be too shocked; they aren’t always reliable but if you’re flexible, it’s always a great option to travel without breaking bank. The good: - cheap prices - extra legroom option is spacious (and worth it imo) - great staff and service on board ( don’t know about customer service) -  wifi works great The bad: - planes are old and worn out - Swoop often cancels and rebooks passengers on different flights (when flight isn’t full they will cancel and rebook you, or are a random layover to board more people).

### "Terrible service, no help at all"
Not Verified |  My father’s flight time was changed to 90 minutes earlier and we were not notified, not by email or any other means. My father missed his flight home from BC and got offered zero compensation for it, he now has the book with another airline to get home. Terrible service, no help at all. Left him stranded.

### "absolutely the worst"
Not Verified | Hamilton to Halifax. Trying to change travel dates for upcoming flight, I have had zero response from airline! Still waiting in queue for an agent for more than 24 hours! And then I waited on hold for 2.5 hours on phone today! Online system pops up errors when I try to modify myself! Customer service is absolutely the worst! With two deaths in the family in 6 months at the other end of the country, we really want to make it for the internment! At this rate we will miss our own!

### "45 minutes to check in my bag"
Not Verified | Phoenix to Edmonton. Worst airline I have ever travelled with! I got to the airport two hours in advance of my flight and I waited an hour and 45 minutes to even check in my bag! There were about 30 people who almost missed their flight due to the airlines inconveniences. Be better!

### "schedule changes every four occasions"
I, for one, have experienced their schedule changes every four occasions I bought tickets from them. They change their flight schedules willy-nilly which caused a lot of hassle for me to rearrange my trip plans including car rentals, housing, and vacation days I take with my employee. Their customer service agent showed me no care in rectifying the trouble that they caused beside offering a refund in the original form of the payment. They in fact explicitly told me that their terms and conditions allow them to change the flight times whereas when you modify your flight date costs you $100 (not refundable in any way). If the regulatory did not obligate them to refund consumers in such incidents, they would not even refund and only get your credit to buy from them again (that happened to me the first time). On top of that, once your flight dates changes and even if you get a refund, you'll need to book another flight to stick to your plans, but then as you get closer to the flight dates, you'd end up paying more to secure a seat for a similar flight. Another wrinkle I had with them was the long waiting time (three hours) to get to customer service. They just acknowledge these flaws, but they think their low-prices warrants them to have those flaws.

### "flight was cancelled due to weather"
My flight was cancelled due to weather. When it was cancelled we had checked our luggage yet there were no staff available to answer questions like when will this flight be rescheduled. After going through another airline to get our luggage back, we went home and found out the next day the flight was leaving at 10am ... impossible to make it to the airport on time. When I called about a refund or voucher, I was told not their issue as the cancelation was due to weather.

### "my flight was delayed for 12 hours"
Not Verified |  Well after multiple attempts I finally got an answer from swoop. It is not the answer I wanted to hear because my flight was delayed for 12 hours and they are offering nothing which in my mind is not acceptable! Thanks Swoop for making my choice an easy one in the future! Good luck staying in business with the brutal customer service you offer!

### "The worst customer service"
The worst customer service I ever had in my life with airline company. Swoop canceled return flight- no emails, no Phone calls and no refund on cancellation. No phone # either for customer service. Took us an hour to figure out how to reach out customer service via FB messenger. Absolutely disgusting customer service.

### "Pathetic airline with ill mannered cabin crews"
Not Verified |  There are vacant legroom seats during the flight but he did not allow me to sit there, this never happened on any international flight. If there was no one sitting there, then what was the problem for misbehaving. The seats were vacant throughout the flight. Pathetic airline with ill mannered cabin crews.

### "late both directions"
Puerto Vallarta to Abbotsford. First time I have ever flown and all I can say is they were late both directions. Not off to a good start. Not sure I would fly with them again or not.

### "I will be a repeat customer"
This was my first flight with Swoop. I appreciate that Swoop held the flight because customs/security was very slow and many of us were late for boarding (on a variety of carriers). Swoop emailed me 4 times while I was stuck in line, telling me that I was delayed by 15 minutes. Then while I was talking to the customs agent, they personally called to check on me. I don't think this happens very often. After racing to my gate, I was met with a friendly greeting from more than one Swoop employee. I will be a repeat customer and I will share my experience with others.

### "reliability not worth the risk"
Not Verified | Toronto to Edmonton. First, Swoop reschedules the flight to 6 hours later in the day. Next, the flight is cancelled on 24 hours notice stranding my 3 children in Toronto while visiting their grandparents. I spend 3.5hours on hold just to talk to someone (promised 30 minutes wait time). I have no issues with the low fare model, but you still have to pick up the phone! Never ever going to fly with this company ever again. When I booked I thought this might save $100 per ticket on a $400 ticket, ended up costing me and extra $400 per ticket to book alternative travel arrangements just to get my children home. This company's reliability is just not worth the risk.

### "this extreme delay was entirely the fault of Swoop"
I’ve flown Swoop a couple times for the low cost, and every time I take the flight I tell myself I’ll never do it again. Check in staff are always extremely rude and unhelpful. They nickel and dime you everywhere. Checked bags are super expensive, no complimentary beverages other than water, it’s just bottom of the barrel service. This time around I had a 6.30am flight to Florida and arrived at the airport at 4.30am having previously “checked in” online the day before. However, they wouldn’t send any digital boarding passes so despite having checked in, I still had to go to the kiosk to get my boarding pass. That line took over an hour because Swoop had 3 other Florida flights at 6.30 and only 5 staff members checking in. Swoops disorganization led to a massive back up in the entire terminal and it took over 3 hours to get through baggage drop, security and customs. Because there were so many flights rushing to make their 6.30am departure, no one was allowed to skip ahead in the lines. Needless to say, my flight was supposed to depart at 6.30am, I walked onto the flight at 7.10am and I am currently writing this review at 8.00am and we’re still waiting for passengers to board. They held the flight, but this extreme delay was entirely the fault of Swoop and their outdated and understaffed system process. Also amongst the kiosk line a baby had dropped their bottle and a giant milk spill was on the floor for a while. I remembered it was there on my way to the desk, but after getting my boarding pass I was in a frantic rush and forgot. So I sped walk straight through it and slipped and landed directly on my back in the middle of the puddle. Disgusting. It had been there over half an hour and because it was all chaos no swoop employees signalled for it to be cleaned up. Now I’m on a cramped flight with an extremely sore back. Never again will I fly Swoop. Not worth saving $100 or more. Do yourself a favour and pick a more reputable airline.

### "discomfort and unprofessional service"
Cost of ticket is not worth the hassle, the discomfort and unprofessional service. I checked reviews before booking but wanted to try myself. Never again even if I get a free ticket. Return flight was delayed, then rescheduled, then delayed again. They called it “miscommunication

### "a no for me for a long time"
Three hours after landing in Victoria for a three day trip they emailed saying the flight home is cancelled and you can get on a new flight a half a day earlier than planned (11am instead of 10pm). They said it was for safety reasons. They just don't have the ability to provide any viable options. For my family, this meant waking up at 5am with little kids the third day instead of arriving at the airport at 8pm. We drove 4 hours to the destination so shortening the trip by a day is really a frustrating and costly option. Then, as you try to navigate the new flight option another flight appears the next morning, ten hours after the cancelled flight (which would of worked fine) but it isn't an option in the email they sent with instructions. Only after waiting for 3 hours on hold (but never talking to anyone) and chatting online do you find out you should of booked that new flight on your own dollar and then they would of refunded you fully. The flight was sold out by that time so isn't an option. The only two options are to take a day off a three day trip or board the next available flight which is literally three days after the original. There isn't an option to be refunded, moved to flight within days of your original or to take a credit. They don't actually ever answer the phone and it's a computer messaging system until you navigate through that. Once you get a real person they just become a broken record typing canned responses. I guess I assumed the poor customer service, massive bag fees, zero entertainment or food, and old crammed planes were the cost of buying a cheap flight. I didn't realise they would literally cancel your flight because of overbooking and not give viable return options or any compensation at all. Customer service when your on vacation and things go wrong is really helpful, I've been there before. It is non-existent with Swoop. Some minor explanation of why or what the logic is would help considerably but you can't actually find that out. It's a no for me for a long time. You get what you pay for I guess.

### "I will never fly Swoop again"
After arriving in Victoria and driving over 5 hours to Tofino for a 3 day trip , I was informed that my return flight to Edmonton was cancelled. I called their customer service line and waited for 2.5 hours and then my call was dropped. I find it hard to believe that a company so inept is still in business. I will never fly Swoop again. Thanks for ruining my vacation!

### "Do not fly Swoop"
Do not fly Swoop. If I ran my business this way I wouldn't have a business. Their customer service is a joke. We landed in BC for a ski vacation with out our ski bag. Which held many essentials. We filed a claim upon landing at airport but there is no way to speak to a person. We have spent hours on the phone with their customer service line only to hear repeatedly by a recording there is no one available. The recording suggests we send a message thru social media to a robot who says they cannot help with our issue and to call customer service. I have no idea if they have my bag ... or what their plans are.

### "they are fantastic"
Not Verified |  My friend was checking airline reviews and was hesitant to fly Swoop because of bad reviews. I was shocked! I fly swoop all the time and only once had a bad experience, but that was at the height of the pandemic when they cancelled my flight and instead flew me into Halifax, a larger center here in the Maritimes. Considering they are about 1/3 the price of the ‘big’ Canadian airline, they are fantastic. Yes they charge for everything, but even with all the extras are still much much cheaper than AC. I prefer seeing my family in Ontario 3x per year instead of once. Swoop is how I can afford that!

### "still waiting for that refund cheque"
Not Verified |  We had booked to go to Vegas. We were suppose to fly out March 16, 2020. Then convid-19 hit. We cancelled our trip as we were not going to risk our lives. Swoop would not refund the ticket, just give us a credit. Then covid-19 as we know did not go away in a year. So Swoop offered a refund in October of 2021. So we of course took that option. We are still waiting for that refund cheque. After numerous letters to Swoop customer service, reaching out to BBB and CTA, absolutely nothing is being done. It is just a big run around.

### "Absolutely ridiculous and a bullying money grab"
I've flown with Swoop 4 or 5 times over the past 5 years and I've never had much trouble with them. It's inexpensive and it does the job, that's all I need. I've used the same 30 liter backpack for 3 of those 5 flights with Swoop and it's always been accepted as a personal item, I purposefully pack light. When I booked the flight, the additional cost for a carry-on was something like $45, but, since I've travelled with this backpack on Swoop many times before, I knew I'd be fine with declining the fee for a carry-on. When I checked in at the airport the morning of my flight, the Swoop employee had me place my bag in this measurement tool - which was highly problematic and arbitrary because my pack was slightly too large one way but considerably smaller than required in another way. The guy charged me $69 for it. A little later I passed by another customer who had been behind me in the check-in line who had a much bigger pack than me. He told me that he wasn't even asked to place his pack in the measurement tool, let alone charged for his pack. He let me take a photo of his pack so I could go back and show the employee to try and get my money back. Well that didn't work. He told me to try the customer service number if I wanted a refund. A few days later, after waiting on hold for over an hour, I got through to customer service and explained the situation. They said that the employees have discretion to ask some customers to measure their packs but not others. So for some arbitrary reason I had to pay $69 for my backpack which they've considered a personal item 3 times before, because they deemed it a carry-on, even though the total volume of the measurement tool was larger than my pack (my pack was only too large in one dimension, smaller in others) and other customers with larger packs didn't have to pay anything. That's ridiculous. If I had known my pack could possibly be considered a carry-on I would've paid for it at the cheaper price of $45 when I booked my ticket. Absolutely ridiculous and a bullying money grab.

### "very poor customer service"
Not Verified |  My flight was cancelled in 2020 due to the pandemic. When asked for a refund, Swoop says that I do not qualify because an alternate flight was offered that was not accepted. The country was shut down. The reason I was travelling was cancelled and has been cancelled for two years due to the pandemic. This is very poor customer service and bad policy. Beware.

### "their customer service is non existent"
Customer service is non existent. Never before have I tried calling an airline, just to be met with 16 hours of waiting for someone to answer over a span of 3 days. The recording says it's easier to get ahold of someone via social media DM than talking to a human on the phone. How is that even acceptable? The website was completely bugging out when I was trying to change my return flight due to a family emergency, so I wanted to talk to someone to get that sorted out asap, to absolutely no avail and 16 hours wasted sitting on hold. I did get ahold of someone on Instagram (a day after messaging) and they were 0 help, they didn't answer any of my questions and provided no feedback to any issue I stated, they told me to just go on the website and change it myself. Did they not even read my message where I explained "the website does not work, it will not let me select a new flight"? This airline was a last minute choice as it was the earliest and only direct flight available, it was over $500 cheaper than the next nearest flight. The crew on the plane were kind and the flight was smooth. It's just their customer service is non existent.

### "won't even provide free water"
Poor customer service, absolutely no additional services (won't even provide free water on board), delayed departure (and no explanation offered), very slow to deliver baggage. Not worth perceived savings. Swoop also doesn't partner with any other airlines, so there's no option to fly with a partner if something goes wrong (like what happened with our outbound flight). Don't recommend. I give them a one because we arrived safely, but that's it.

### "they did not allow us to board"
Edmonton to Hamilton at 11:10am on 18th feb 2022. Me, my husband and my brother in law were travelling together. We checked in 9:50am. At security they put our one bag separate for detailed checking it took some time and we reached at boarding door at 10:50am still 20 minutes to flight but they did not allow us to board. They said they closed the doors but we still had 20 minutes. Staff was so rude with us. We requested them but still they did not allow us. Please don’t waste your money on swoop. Swoop staff at Edmonton airport is  very rude.

### "airline is grossly overpriced"
The airline is grossly overpriced they may allow you to buy a cheap ticket but any baggage will be at an extra cost including carry-on. I flew with WestJet from Toronto to Cancun prior to using swoop. Swoop is owned by WestJet. I had an oversize bag that they charged me an extra hundred dollars flying with WestJet. I assumed when I flew a swoop it would be the same. This is not the case they said that my baggage exceeded their oversize baggage limit so I needed to unpack some of it luckily I was able to unpack into a backpack that I had brought as well. I then had to pay an oversize bag charge which was over $100 I had to pay to check the backpack which is another $60 and then I had to pay for my guitar which I could normally bring as a carry-on all and all I paid over $300 for my luggage also I got them to Put a fragile sticker on my suitcase and my backpack. My computer was in my backpack and now it’s completely destroyed. I spent over $1000 Canadian on a plane ride that would normally only cost me around 300. Please never use this airline.

### "would not issue a refund"
I will never book with your company again. We had booked a trip pre-COVID. Swoop changed our flight times/days multiple times. The last change had us flying out of Hamilton airport and arriving in London ON. Swoop maybe you can explain to me how we are supposed to retrieve a car from an airport over an hour away. We were forced to cancel our trip due to this change. You would not issue a refund because “we cancelled” and now you will not even extend our credit. I hope everyone reads these comments and realize the savings are not worth it. We will never book will never book with you or your parent company Westjet airlines again

### "Never fly with them"
Not Verified |  Swoop is bad. Never fly with them. We were supposed to fly to Mexico at 8:45am and they sent an email at 4:35 am saying that the flight was cancelled which is not enough time to notify out of town people like ourselves. They did rebook our flights for the next evening, but we’re losing 2 days at our resort in Mexico. We were offered $30 dollar food vouchers for our troubles but that will not cover food for two days, plus they’re only good within the airport. Don’t fly swoop

### "a problem with my travel documents"
Not Verified |  This was my worst ever travel experience. I was traveling with a large family group for a birthday vacation. The check in employee separated me from my family because I was traveling under a different nationality passport. This has never been an issue previously with other airlines. The staff wouldn’t explain what was going on and would not answer questions. Eventually I was told I could not travel with them. The check in employee had decided there was a problem with my travel documents and we did not have time to appeal the issue. I had to make other travel arrangements and I’m now flying with a different airline a day later, with no issues. The customer service is the worst I have seen in the airline industry.

### " refused our subsequent request to refund us the difference"
Our family had flight reservations with Swoop. There were 4 travelers. Prior to booking with Swoop we read their website including the page on cancellations, and this information informed our decision to purchase tickets with Swoop. The tickets purchased were for flight 630 departing Edmonton to Cancun direct on April 6 2022, and returning from Cancun to Edmonton on April 13 2022. Subsequent to purchasing flight tickets with Swoop we purchased our hotels and travel insurance. On February 25 2022, Swoop emailed us notification that our flights were cancelled. They offered us to instead leave Edmonton on April 9 2022 and return on April 16 2022. These dates do not work for us, particularly with our having already purchased a hotel and the costs associated with it. We requested Swoop rebook us on a WestJet flight departing the same date and returning the same date. Swoop refused to grant our request, in spite of the promise on their website that for cancellations, they would rebook us on an airline they have a commercial agreement with if we requested it. The promise on their website is quite clear that this is an offer available if requested. After requesting multiple times, and upon Westjet having only 4 seats left on one of the flights, we purchased a flight on WestJet at a substantially higher cost. Swoop refused our subsequent request to refund us the difference in price between the tickets we were forced to purchase on WestJet and the tickets we had originally purchased through Swoop.

### "Swoop charges for every little thing"
Booked 2 tickets to Victoria to see family as Christmas gift. Bought the tickets for about 300$ less than most other airlines, plus Swoop was offering direct flights. I purchased tickets for my partner and I. I then received 2 emails, which went into my Junk folder about the flight. I had book March 12 - 16 as it coincided with March break and fit both work schedules. The emails from Swoop were that the flights I had booked had been "rescheduled". I thought that meant a later or earlier flight - but instead it meant that they moved the flight to March 10 (a Thursday) and back on the 14th (a Monday). Further to this inconvenience, as a surprise I had booked an Air BnB to stay in as a mini vacation for the family members. When I spoke with Swoop online they said "we sincerely apologize for the interruption to your travel plans" but would do nothing to help rectify the situation. If I wanted to speak with someone in person, it was $15 + tax to do so. They changed my flight by 2 days, but I have to pay to speak to someone? Next they booked us onto flights that have a stopover in Edmonton. The flights I had originally purchased were direct flights. So now the flights are 2 days earlier and have a layover in Edmonton. I suggested that some sort of gesture to help would be appreciated seeing as I paid for the tickets to be direct, a checked bag $76 each way and seats seem to start at $27 each. But the person online simply said, sorry and told me to contact my insurance provider! Not sure what they would do for me if Swoop caused the problem. Has nothing to do with insurance. End of the day, Swoop charges for every little thing. They make changes with little notification and are not able to solve any problems short of full refund. Will not be flying Swoop again ever.

### "Absolute scam of an airline"
Absolute scam of an airline. Booked with Swoop because it seemed to be cheaper than Air Canada. The price of the swoop tickets was $350 for both ways and the Air Canada tickets were about $600. I then proceeded to purchase the Swoop tickets for seemingly obvious reasons. While checking in to my flight 24hrs prior to departure, I got hit with $400 in bag fees. $200 for each way. This then made the swoop tickets cost $750. They charge you for a carry-on, but not to worry because they are nice enough to let you take a backpack for free. After that mess, I was hit with a total of 10hrs delays, 5hrs each way. There was absolutely no customer service. They also don't have free water on the plane so if you are thirsty you better have a credit card because they don't take cash or debit either. I will never fly Swoop again.

### "never book with this airline again"
Not Verified |  We booked our trip in January to depart in April round trip from Toronto to Victoria BC, for my sons wedding. At that time we booked our car rental and two different place to stay. Today I received a modification to our flights. The flight will leave two days later and return one day earlier. I had to cancel and rebook with another airline. The cost of the change to our flights and car rental exceed $700.00. Al that was offered was a thank you for our understanding. I will never book with this airline again.

### "won’t refund my money"
They cancelled my flight due to “weather” a day before it was to leave (and it wasn’t even bad). They offered no alternative flying options and won’t refund my money or provide a flight credit.

### "I would absolutely avoid Swoop at all costs"
This airline seems like a scam to me - with so much red tape enforced in order for them to make money while being "low cost. Despite the federal government rule that health cards expired during COVID are extended until September 2022, the attendant refused to accept it as a real government ID. Tried to show other forms of ID that were also not accepted (I don't have a drivers license). Both the attendant and her supervisor were rude and very dismissive of the situation and refused to let me board. Waited on their "customer service" hotline to try and discuss with an agent for two hours until I realized their unresponsiveness, as someone mentioned below, is "by design. Also messaged them on Facebook to try to discuss the issue, but again the human/bot (no idea who I was actually speaking to) - was very dismissive - and then assured me that "You are able to use your health card within your own province, you are not able to use it to travel. You require valid government ID" - This, I know to be completely untrue - as I flew domestically using health card as ID two weeks ago. Anyways - all this to say I would absolutely avoid Swoop at all costs - for their lack of transparency in their "rules" if not for the terrible customer service.

### "Unable to use credit"
Not Verified |  Unable to use credit. We called the number on the website. Representatives gave us the runaround and put us back in the queue every time we mentioned we wanted to use our credits or that we wanted to speak to a supervisor. We chatted to a "live" agent online and just to make sure there was someone there we just had a small conversation until we mentioned we wanted to use our credits, they never responded after that to any of our questions/comments. I can say goodbye to our credits but I thought people should know what kind of company Swoop is. How is it that they are still allowed to operate is beyond me.

### "company is completely built to offer no customer service of any kind"
I was flying to Ontario for Christmas with my family, and learned the hard way about why to avoid Swoop. After this experience I will never travel with Swoop or their parent company WestJet ever again. On the day I was to travel my brother, who I was staying with, tested positive for covid. I had nowhere else to stay, and he and my extended family all had to quarantine for ten days (my trip was 8 days). I did everything possible to cancel or change my flight. These were extenuating circumstances and needed to speak to someone. This is what I learned that you should know: There is no customer support. I waited on hold for 2.5 hours to speak to someone, no one will ever answer the phone, and this is by design (more on this later). The buttons to make changes to your flight is greyed out in the back end of your user account so there is no way to let them know there is a problem (this is by design). When you speak to them on their website or any social media platform, you get a bot and never a person (this is by design). Why is this by design? I had no choice but to dispute the charges for the flights on my credit card through my flight cancellation insurance. I was denied any refund even at the credit card level. Why? Because, I could not show that I tried to cancel, even though I spent 4 hours that day in total trying to get in touch with them, right up until the moment my flight was to depart. They will tell your credit card company that you didn't show up so they can keep your money and leave you with no recourse. I was advised by my credit card company to contact the better business bureau to fight and try to get them charged to return my $800, but you and I both know this won't happen. This company is completely built, from the ground up, to offer no customer service of any kind. They have a fine print terms and conditions that was written very specifically to shield them from ever having to give a refund, and no matter how extreme your case, even with extreme medical complications and prior notice, they will refuse outright to even speak to you, let alone make arrangements to help you in any way, shape or form. I will not be in a financial hardship from this, but I know many many people who would be devastated to lose this much money. It is not fair, and they shouldn't get away with it. Swoop and WestJet have lost my business forever, and I will be telling this story to anyone who will listen so they know what kind of company they really are.

### "Swoop is a scam airline"
Not Verified |  We were supposed to fly from Abbotsford to Edmonton but Swoop cancelled on us at time of departure. We found a new flight as we had to be in Edmonton the next morning for a business meeting within the hour and boarded our new flight. When we landed in Edmonton I got an email from Swoop stating that our flight had been rebooked for 30 hours after our previous departure was supposed to happen. I tried calling but they were closed as their hours are 8-4 and have no after hours service. The next morning (after the flight was already supposed to be boarded) at 8am, I called and tried getting a refund. Nothing. They were rude and told us it was our problem and took our money. Swoop is a scam airline. I've flown with them on 10 different occasions and this is not the first time its happened, it's the third.

### "Find a different airline to fly"
Not Verified | They cancelled our flight after the time it was supposed to take off. We waited in an hour long line and by the time we got to the counter the only remaining flight that day was full. We had to get to Edmonton for a 7 am meeting the next day so we booked another airline that left that night. After a two hour wait on hold, they told me I lost my money and there’s nothing they can do. The man on the phone was extremely rude and would not give me a complaint email address or his manager. Find a different airline to fly.

### "Swoop would not refund us"
My sister and I booked flights last spring 2021, Swoop changed our flight times more than 4 times! Then where we were flying to had multiple shut downs due to covid, so we needed to cancel our flights. Swoop would not refund us, they gave us a credit. I just contacted them again as I am not vaccinated, and cannot travel without it. They said they will not refund.

### "Come on on Swoop. you can do better"
Not Verified |  My flight was excellent without any issues, no concerns on the flight end. direct from Abbotsford BC to Hamilton. I used the online "quicker" email option to try to make changes to my flight (spending more on options). I waited 8 days for a response from Swoop without any reply. I ultimately gave up, used the phone and waited the nominal 50 minutes until I got an attendant and the matter was rectified. Another flight coming up and being as thick as I am, I used the "quicker" online email option spelling out my issue again. Again up to day 4 and no reply. So here I go again on hold with the phone up to 42 minutes and I give up. This is incredibly poor customer service either way, whether using either option. Come on on Swoop. you can do better.

### "made me pay for the 2nd bag"
Very bad experience at customer service, I had a digital copy with barcode for covid test and the lady at customer service has no idea how to scan the barcode with her phone, after 15 minutes someone else came there and scanned it from his own phone. I had 2 personal bags and she made me pay for the 2nd bag. This flight cost me very expensive.

### "stranded with no support from Swoop"
Flight was cancelled. Lady at the counter instructed us to check our email and leave the airport. We tried to rebook our flight through the app which was not working. Calling customer services wait times were over an hour and kept getting different responses. Swoops outsourced those call center and clearly staff wasn't trained. We were then instructed that adjustments can only be made at the airport. We made a second journey to the airport where no staff was available. We are currently stranded with no support from Swoop and have spent a full day trying to rebook. Two journey to the airport and 5 hours on the phone.

### "Don't be fooled by the price"
We were scheduled to fly to Edmonton on Dec 22nd. The flight was cancelled and there was no one to guide us. Apparently we were supposed to get an email which went to the junk folder. At the time, we didn't get an email and we were running out of time to catch another flight the same night via WestJet to Edmonton. WestJet which is the parent company refused to reschedule our flight unless we paid for it because we didn't have the email. Under such pressure we paid and now filing a complaint. I will never fly this airline again. It's the worse service I have ever seen. You are left stranded in an airport no knowing what to do. No everyone has access to an email. So they should have someone to guide the passengers when a flight is cancelled or rescheduled. This airline is definitely not recommended. Don't be fooled by the price. It will cost you way more than you think.

### "they didn’t allow us to check in"
I took a flight from Hamilton to Abbotsford on 25th of December 2021. One of the agent told me that I only reserved my luggage on one way from Abbotsford to Hamilton but there is not any reservations for from Hamilton to Abbotsford. But even I told then that I did it for both way but she said no. Thus, I paid extra 81$ at airport. First they land us here in Vancouver due to wind storm that’s okay but when we went there for luggage, my bag was not there. Because they send my bag to someone another’s address in Edmonton. And I didn’t get my bag for half days of my trip. Even I buy new clothes. When I was coming back from Abbotsford to Hamilton first they delayed our flight for one hour and even we reached there 50 minutes before. But they didn’t allow us to check in.

### "atrocious staff"
Not Verified | Poor poor customer service and atrocious staff at the Halifax airport. If they are doing their job they should do it proper. First they charged me $120 for one bag which is ridiculous. Then my flight was cancelled and they had no information or they refused to say anything what so ever. And now I have been on hold for 2 hours and there is nothing I can do to confirm my rescheduled flight.

### "had a very pleasant experience"
Not Verified | I had a very pleasant experience with the staff of this airline and the crew was very kind. It is a discount airline so you have to expect a level of accommodations, but as far as attitude goes, the people who work here were fantastic. The fees can add up, but again you have to understand what you are buying in to.

### "they constantly change dates"
Not Verified |  Was supposed to fly to Orlando for a week with the family. Swoop changed both flights twice which made a one week trip into a 2 day trip. We obviously cancelled and booked with WestJet instead. This flight was using another credit we had for another Swoop issue for another flight we didn’t take so we still have a credit and not sure how we will ever use it. If your flight is dependant on a specific date do not fly with Swoop as they constantly change dates and their customer service is pathetic. Asked if I could just use the credit for a hotel booked through them and they said no, that credit is useless as I will never try with them again, they can have the money, lord knows they need it.

### "Customer service was poor"
Not Verified | Customer service was poor. They refused to honour Ontarios extension on drivers licence validity until February 2022, and were refusing to let me board, even when showing a digital copy of the renewal I had already done they refused until I found an information kiosk where I could print and board just as the flight closed. They claimed the Covid extension stopped in September despite the Ontario government site clearly stating February 2022 is when they needed to renew by.

### "Poor customer service"
Not Verified |  Paid to move my flight to have a few extra days, my flight was cancelled and moved back to one day past my original flight, causing me to miss the function I extended the flight for. I asked at the gate if I qualified to get the $65 I paid to change the flight back they said yes and to contact customer service. Customer service basically told me to fly a kite as it wasn’t their fault? I fly multiple times a month with Swoop but will now use Flair. Poor customer service.

### "they aren't really a cheap airline"
Not Verified | Absolutely brutal customer service!! You buy a plane ticket and would expect that that would include a seat on the plane but it doesn't - you have to pay for a seat. Then, you pay to either carry your bag on the plane or to check it. I paid to carry on and ended up having to pay a second time because I had to check my bag. Since they can't deduct the amount I had already paid, they told me I would have to apply for a refund on the cost of carry-on and pay the full price to check it. Swoop replied saying "no refund", sorry that is "your choice". By not refunding duped customers, they are able to remain a "low cost" airline. When you add your ticket, your seat and your baggage cost, they aren't really a cheap airline. With so many other options out there, I will pay a few extra dollars with an airline that provides fair service to their customers.

### "absolutely brutal customer service"
Not Verified |  Cancelled flights, changed return destinations, on hold for over an hour. Denied refund or credits by absolutely brutal customer service. Worst airline I have ever dealt with. To save $200 they cost me an additional $600 plus in extra cost and the lost time and frustration is invaluable. Avoid.

### "absolutely no help with their company"
Not Verified |  I purchased my flight in September and am trying to get a full refund as there has been a serious family emergency. I have tried calling SWOOP near 15 times and have gotten absolutely no answer and have spent hours on hold. I have tried emailing them around 40 times, and I have used the Facebook messenger service (which is awful) and have not been able to get anywhere let alone speak to a live person. This service is absolutely brutal and now am down $500 on a flight with absolutely no help with their company.

### "your bag seems not carry-on"
This airline has the worst customer service ever. I flew to Hamilton from Abbotsford on November 4th for diwali celebration with my family in Ontario. I was very excited. When I was checking in the lady told me that your bag seems not carry-on, I have paid for the carry-on. I told her that I have always travelled with the same bag and it easily fit as the carry-on, she didn’t listen to me and forced me to pay $73 extra or I cannot board the flight. Then I talked to the supervisor she told me that she cannot do anything but she advised me to call customer care, after 4 tries and being on hold for more than an hour someone finally picked up my call but she said she cannot do anything about it. And she told me to email the swoop airline with the receipt explaining the whole scenario. I sent them the email a week ago and they didn’t get back to me yet. While coming back as it was a round trip I thought they’re going to charge me again for the carry-on as the luggage bag but I preferred to stay quiet. The Hamilton swoop staff let me go with the same carry-on. It ridiculous and funny how they are okay with the same bag 10 time and this lady force me to pay this one time because maybe she was having a bad day.

### "Don't cheap out and use Swoop"
When we first got to airport my senior parents checked in their bags, 1 bag was 2 kg over weight so they paid $113 extra for the 2 kg. Then as we were waiting Swoop announced the flight to Winnipeg was leaving. They made this announcement at least 5x. My parents were going to Edmonton so since their flight was not announced for boarding and boarding was cut off at 7.45am we waited before going through security. Finally 7.30am came, still no announcement about boarding the flight to Edmonton. My parents went through security, got to the girl who was taking boarding passes. My mom got through, but the girl was having issues scanning my dads pass. Then she got real snotty and told him he missed his flight anyways. It wasn't even 7.45am yet. Then my parents were informed they sent their luggage to Edmonton, and that they would not be reimbursed. The girl who was at the airport as customer service was very rude. My parents are seniors and with them not having the medications because Swoop sent it to Edmonton and then ignorantly said its too bad for them. Luckily I have a brother in Calgary who drove to Edmonton to get their luggage. My parents then had to pay for another flight with WestJet for the same day. Then when you try to call Swoop customer service they want to charge you $0 or $15. Just to call and talk to someone. Don't cheap out and use Swoop, they screwed my parents big time. Then ignore emails to try and rectify the problems.

### "had an excellent trip"
We are a family of 4 that took a mini-vacation from Edmonton to Victoria over Thanksgiving 2021. I was hesitant to book Swoop based on the plethora of bad reviews but the price was just too good to pass up. I had only flew with Swoop once before on a solo two-day trip to Toronto that went without a hitch. Booking: Fully-online. No trouble. Seat selection: Paid for 4 seats up-front as a kids was free to select a seat for if an adult paid for a seat. Not too shabby. Bag Charge: Paid for one checked bag up front to save costs at the Airport. Weighed in at 48 pounds. Checked bags: Did not bring checked bags due to cost. Personal items: Kids brought mini-back-backs that held small electronics, snacks, a water bottle. All within specs. No issues. I brought a laptop case that also fit snacks and water. No issue. Wife brought large purse with no issue. Just don't expect to pack clothes to avoid the check-in bag charge and you will be alright. Post-booking: Swoop up and changes out return date from Tuesday to Monday. Given that we were departing on the Saturday, this cut the by a 1/3 if accepted. I did not accept and changed the flights to arrive and depart a day earlier resulting in the same length of stay. Did this on-line with no issues and no additional fees for either the change itself or cost of the new dates as the original cost of both those dates was $150 more than the dates we originally picked. Swoop absorbed the cost on-line due to the cancellation of one of the return flight date. Issues post re-booking: The paid checked bag moved over to the new flights but the seat assignments and the fact we paid did not. No ability to select seats on-line without paying the same fee over again. Called the call center number, put the phone on the desk while I did other things on the computer and was connected after 105 minutes. The call center agent was able to book the 4 of us together at no charge based on the fact we had originally paid for the tickets. A bit of a hassle but we were getting a better itinerary dates than the one we originally purchased so I took the good with the bad. Check-in: Checked in on-line and downloaded digital boarding passes. That did not take care of still needing to check in the checked bag so we arrived 60 minutes before the check-in closed to drop off the bag. Bad check-in took 4 minutes. Same experience on the return flight. No wait for agent to weigh and check in our suitcase. Flight: No issues. Staff were friendly. We brought snacks and water from the departure area stores before boarding. No issues with that. Bought a rum and I asked for two cups with ice and a full can of coke which they happily provided. Toasted by wife on what was an excellent vacation. Despite the cancellation of the return flight date (they cancelled all Tuesday flights from Edmonton to Victoria for the next year which meant we were not a one-off) everything else went as expected. Same thing could have happened with any other airline so we did play the victim card and had an excellent trip. The only word of advice I would give is to book refundable hotels in case this type of cancellation happens. We booked our hotels using air miles so lost a night at the end. In retrospect, we should have kept the hotel options open until closer to the departure date and not used Air miles for that part of the trip. Cheers.

### "showed me zero compassion"
Not Verified |  I've been experiencing quite possibly the worst few month of my life and Swoop agents showed me zero compassion in anyway that actually matters, adding insult to injury. I had to cancel my flight within the 24 hour window on October 5th due to illness and had to get a COVID-19 test. I was told my flight could be rescheduled. Under the impression my flight was successfully cancelled I was instructed to call back to reschedule the next day when I knew a return date. That very same day, my father had a stroke. I was actually visiting him because he had a heart attack just 2 weeks prior. Needless to say he was in the hospital and this was a scary time where I was far more preoccupied with my parents and making sure my father was going to be ok. A few days after that, I get the news that the man I love and was supposed to spend my life with passed away suddenly. I don't think further explanation is needed for just how taxing what I have been experiencing is on one's mental and physical health, let alone finances. My week long visit turned into one month and it's quite evident why calling Swoop back was not a top priority. I put a request in for an agent to contact me days ago and never heard from anyone. I called today and was on hold for around an hour. The agent I finally connected with, despite my specific circumstances around my return, was purely focused on the fact that the last agent who was supposed help me with my flight conveniently did not "cancel" my flight or take any notes that mention the word cancel. Meaning she could not credit me for a flight that was not cancelled and was unwilling to consider any other way of assisting me. Life happens, and being a budget airline I thought that they may understand the gravity finances have on people's lives. Due to life events entirely out of my control that I am still learning how to cope with today, I'm now out more money paying for another flight so I can return to work before I stop getting paychecks. All I can say it when it rains it pours. Thank you Swoop for adding to my snowball of issues. I left this same comment on one of their Facebook posts and they got back to me giving me their empty condolences and stating that had I reached out via social media  they may have been able to help me. The reality is it should not matter how I contact them. I contacted them by phone and spoke to 2 customer service agents who should have been able to help me. I replied highlighting this and the fact that they can help me but just refuse to and I never heard back after that. I have supported them fully up until now.

### "they charge me for the carry on"
Not Verified |  It was such a bad experience. I took a bagpack with me and when I went to check in they charge me for the carry on. I was forced to pay that. The customer service is so horrible I will not travel with swoop anymore. The customer service number never work they only talk to you on messenger which is so frustrated typing text over and over. Anyway I will not recommend them.

### "I am so unhappy with them"
This airline is honestly the worst for customer service! I few with them in July and it was fine but for my October flight I am so unbelievably upset. I am so unhappy with them and will never fly with them again. I bought my ticket 35 hours before I had to cancel due to a unexpected family emergency and the customer service team did nothing but give me the same answer over and over again, after a few emails and several days they stopped responding. I get the rules but less then 48 hours and they wouldn't do anything. Never use this airline.

### "service I have received has been zero"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight out of Kelowna, BC in in the middle of August 2021 for departure the second week of September 2021 back to Toronto for a business trip. I was happy to see the cost of this flight was around $150 + about another $100 in baggage fees for a total of $250. Great deal! My issue is closer to the date Kelowna was suffering various forest fires that were reeking havoc on that part of the province. With these unforeseen challenges my work decided to move our meeting venue to Vancouver, BC and avoid Kelowna due to these challenges. I reached out to Swoop via their Customer Service email because they do not have a call center you can call in to (unless you want to pay $15 to get someone on a call). I made them aware that I understood that this was a discount fee I received on my flight but at minimum I should have a refund on the luggage fees I paid for ahead of time ($100). The auto response I received was "Someone would reach out to you within 30 days". I have followed up twice with no response as of yet. The service I have received has been zero from them and I will never book a flight through this airline ever again. Be aware of this when looking in to a booking with Swoop!

### "It’s extremely poor service for a new airline to treat customers like this"
I paid for a checked bag before my flight to Toronto, 46$ which I found reasonable due to the cheap ticket prices. When I arrived at the airport the Swoop employee told me I had not paid for my return flights checked bag. I would need to pay 69$ plus tax for a checked bag since it was not in advance. I explained to him that I did attempt to pay for my checked bag for this flight and that it made no sense to pay for a checked bag a week in advance and not for one on my current flight. He had no answers or solutions for me and was extremely quiet and unhelpful. It’s extremely poor service for a new airline to treat customers like this. I will not be flying with this company anymore.

### "Everything turned out perfectly fine"
Not Verified |  Everything turned out perfectly fine. My family of three paid to check a massive bag (which we all shared) and then trotted aboard with our personal items. The flight left on time and arrived on time (for what it's worth, the descent into Abbotsford is breathtaking). The crew were brisk but pleasant. Yes, the seats feel a bit like 1970's lawn chairs and yes, you have to pay for extras (carry-on, food, entertainment), but bring a book and a snack, and you'll be fine. And, let's face it, $300 return is a steal.

### "I was told today that there was absolutely no refund"
Not Verified |  Booked a flight for travel in March 2020, we couldn’t travel because we were in the middle of a pandemic (covid 19) so I was originally told to wait there would be a refund shortly, when not hearing from them I start to investigate again! You can only get a hold of them through a chat board! I was told today that there was absolutely no refund, we would have to take the credit. I paid for the tickets (3 of them) and I want my refund. Annoyed beyond belief!

### "Avoid this airline at all costs"
Not Verified |  I had a trip booked with my girlfriend to go to Winnipeg and I am an essential worker who was recently in close contact with someone who tested positive for Covid19. I tested negative but was advised to quarantine. I told the airline this and they would not offer a credit or even a refund. They said they could rebook my flight 2 weeks later when I am away on a business trip. We asked if they could extend the 2 weeks and they refused. We asked if they could offer us a credit as we would like to use it at a later date and they refused. We even offered to have my Girlfriend go alone and just get credited for the 1 ticket and they still refused. They said they would not help us in any way. So we were left with 2 choices, use the ticket and go on the airline and potentially expose every one of their staff and customers to Covid19 or lose out on the money we paid for the flights. As such, I am going to go on the flight and hope for the best, I hope someone from their head office sees this. Avoid this airline at all costs. Also, what this company doesn't realize, is that I travel for business and will be taking 60-80 flights per year and will be sure to tell everyone about my experience with Swoop. Lifetime value of a customer, look it up, learn it.

### "Found the staff very helpful and pleasant"
Not Verified |  Found the staff very helpful and pleasant. As a senior they were excellent in helping me board and to get off the plane. They had a wheel hair at both ends as I can no longer do stairs. Seats where fine. Thank You Swoop.

### "Ripping people off for luggage"
Not Verified |  I have just used Swoop with my family for the 1st time and we were not impressed. Our other family member used this airline as well 2 yrs ago and same problems with luggage. For there over luggage is an absolute rip off. You pay for your luggage at nearly 50.00 and have a couple pounds over they charge 1130.00 each bag. This is absolutely ridiculous. Then our other family member charged them luggage and wouldn't allow her to check her bag in. This airline is terrible. Ripping people off for luggage is just wrong.

### "a very low quality airline"
Horrible Customer Service. Would not recommend to fly with them unless you are jammed for cash. Make sure you get your luggage and seat situation sorted out well before hand because they will not allow you to make alterations on luggage even though you already paid. Also don't wait until you get to the airport to get checked or carry on bag because they will charge extra. All in all this is a very low quality airline and should be avoided if possible.

### "moved my flight one whole day"
They moved my flight one whole day, saying they are very sorry for the inconveniences, but not really providing a reason why they had to do this. I'm not a frequent traveler, but I've taken quite a few fights in the last 40 years and this is the very first time this happens to me. I submitted a claim to see if they could cover the additional lodging costs I had due to this change and was useless. And still they didn't explain why that happened. What's the point of using a cheap airline if they will cause you to spend more on other aspects of the trip. Now I've realized there are reviews posted here by people who have gone through the same. Lesson learned for the future to check reviews before flying with an airline for the first time.

### "She was very kind and nice"
The best airline customer service during pandemic. They changed my flight time but opened a 14-day window to reschedule the flight. I checked in a new date but then had to change it again, the lady on the phone not changed my flight date after I had checked in (less than 24 hours to the flight), and also kept the seat and baggage that I had purchased. She was very kind and nice. However it took 50 minutes to reach the customer service on the phone, but in the end everything went well.

### "I am disgusted with the way I was treated"
After an hour delay I was boarding the plane. We were being rushed by security as we were the last ones getting on the plane. A customer was speaking to the stewardess in the doorway. I was taking my time due to covid precautions. I smiled and greeted her, she waved and returned the greeting I said something about being rushed then I proceeded into the plane to put my bags up. Suddenly a new stewardess appears behind me yelling at me "If you don't hurry up and sit down and shut up I will ground this plane. I have that power". I said, I was just putting my bag up. She yelled at me not to talk back "there are 300 people on board who want to go home! You need to sit down and shut up now or it will be grounded". I dropped my bag in the aisle hoping she would let my husband put it away as he was still coming on behind me. I asked the woman in her seat to let me in to mine and quickly sat down. The woman proceeded to yell at me that "we took a vote whether to fly or wait until tomorrow and I am happy to wait until tomorrow so go ahead and say one more word". I told her I was sitting and not speaking, what more did she want from me. She went back into the cabin. Half an hour later my husband asked for a drink - this staff member refused to get him a drink because of the earlier incident - apparently I called someone a name. If she misunderstood and thought I said something inappropriate why didn't she question me about it at the time? Why would the other woman come from behind to do the yelling. I am flabbergast. I never called anyone a name and I don't deserve to be treated with such rudeness. I was so embarrassed being scolded and terrified that I wouldn't be able to go home to my children. We were thirsty as we can't bring water on with us and now for 4 hours couldn't get a drink. I had to go to the bathroom but had to hold it for three hours for fear of this woman turning the plane around. As we were leaving the plane they were all laughing about how this woman was finishing a 12 hour shift. When we left Ontario we were rushed onto the plane so they could "hurry up and get home", when we left Abbotsford we were delayed an hour then yelled at to hurry up. I am disgusted with the way I was treated. The staff were terrible, she ruined my flight.

### "offer nothing for bereavement"
An airline with no compassion but happy to exploit. I was out west to visit my son when I found out my father’s cancer had spread and they would be taking him off life support. I quickly moved my flight up from the afternoon to the morning. Swoop was just as quick to exploit this a charge me approximately $450 to sell me me an empty seat and charge a premium to sell my afternoon seat. I informed them of the situation and offered to answer any questions they had. Their response is we are a discount airline and offer nothing for bereavement. I can not rank this kind of behaviour low enough.

### "I lost my $500"
I bought a ticket in 2019 to fly from Toronto to Montego Bay and return. I bought my ticket six month before departure date. A month before my departure date, I had a back injury that got me bed ridden for few weeks and my doctor advice against any major movement and definitely against traveling. I got a letter from him and tried to call the airline and got a recording that they charge CAN$15 for each call. I tried to reach them through Facebook and got no where. No one bothered to contact me. My departure date came and went and I lost my $500 without any chance to change dates or get a credit.

### "when booking a flight chose another airline"
Not Verified |  First time booking a trip with Swoop, and likely the last time. They may have a schedule but I would suggest it be taken as a suggestion. Booked a flight for my wife and it was moved up a day and we had to make changes to her schedule to accomodate the change. I booked my flight to meet her a week later and arrived at the airport to catch my flight only to find out it was cancelled. An e-mail was sent at 10:40 the night before but when you have an early flight you generally don't look at e-mail when you go to bed especially after you have already checked in (at least I don't). The Swoop rep at the counter when I arrived was very nice but not helpful at all with providing options other than cancel the flight and get a refund, Swoop made no effort to accomodate the passengers on the flight other than we will give you a hotel and meal voucher, nice gesture but it doesn't solve my travel problem. I book in advance so I can take advantage of the best airfare and book my schedule according to the flight plans. To have to wait 2 days for another Swoop flight doesn't cut it. Then trying to re-book with another airline last minute and have to pay last minute exorbatent pricing to keep your original scheduled plans is BS! If I had booked with the other airline in the first place it wouldn't have costed me an additional $430. I understand situations occur causing delays and cancellations but the airline should step up and make arrangements to accomodate the booked passengers rather than letting them fend for themselves. I guess you get what you pay for but this will be the last time Swoop will get any business from me. Do yourself a favor and when booking a flight chose another airline that is reputable and reliable.

### "saying that is late to cancel"
This review is not for a flight. This is for their customer service. They do not care for customers at all. I book the flight and tried to cancel it within 15 minutes. I was not able to cancel it and I have tried to call them to cancel they were unavailable saying to contact them through Facebook. Than next day I called and waited 1.5 hours on the phone and they refused to cancel saying that is to late and that they have fine print saying that is late to cancel. I wanted to cancel within 15 minutes. Don't we have 24 hours time to cancel. We have always use swoop in the past. I will make sure to never use this company ever again and inform everybody I can about the way how they are running they business. Again this review is for Swoop customer service.

### "Swoop is not reliable!"
Not Verified |  Swoop is not reliable! Any money you think you save will be lost going though the hoops. You really do get what you pay for with them. It was near impossible to reach someone at swoop to find out about our account in early 2020 when they were cancelled because of Covid. No refund, only credit. Booked flights in advance (2021) and had Swoop change the flights on me with short notice. Their flight change added over $900 to my trip just for the extra lodging and rental car alone, not counting meals. I had booked vacation time the original dates selected assuming that Swoop was an honourable company. Bottom line = Swoop is a hack airline.

### "Will never fly Swoop again"
Overpriced, unreasonably expensive carry-on baggage fees. I booked 2 flights for my elderly parents and we were forced to pay $158.20 at the airport just to carry-on their baggage (one each). Not even to check it! Will never fly Swoop again. Plus my parents complained about how overly cramped they were with poor seat/leg room, and they're both average heights.

### "worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  The worst airline ever. Do not fly this unless absolutely necessary. Not only did swoop change our flight by two whole days only two weeks before our trip, but it has been nothing but issues since boarding this plane. Swoop nickel and dimes you for everything little thing so don’t be fooled by the “cheap” prices. They are disorganized, rude, do not communicate, are not a large airline so many issues with airports.

### "you don't get a refund, just credit"
Worst Airline in terms of being customer centric. Hard to believe some of their practices are even ethical. If they change the schedule on you, you don't get a refund, just credit. Why? If they cancelled my flight during COVID, I don't get my refund to my credit card because I booked using Airline Credit. Why? No flexibility in their credit either to book hotels. You can only use their credit for their limited flights. Promised me initially that I'm eligible for a refund and strung me along for 8 months. Every other airline that's cancelled a flight has refunded me in less than a week. 8 months for a refund that still didn't happen?

### "they refused a refund"
I booked with Swoop in mid December 2020 for a return flight leaving from Toronto to Kelowna for March 28 returning April 2. In February, I received an email saying that my return flight has changed to April 1 from April 2, shortening our trip by 24 hours. I accepted the changes and on March 3rd, i rearranged our travel plans for this new return flight. The next morning [March 4th] I received another email saying that my flight has changed to April 4th from April 1. At this point, we can no longer make the trip as it has changed so drastically. I called the airline and they refused a refund, only offering a credit. I asked to speak to someone else and was transferred. The supervisor said they can make changes as necessary and would not refund me. I have since filed a formal complaint with the Canadian Travel Agency and with my credit card provider.

### "No more flights for the day"
Swoop canceled our flight Edmonton to Abbotsford BC 5 min before boarding by email! They couldn't even announce till everyone was upset all at the counter. They said there was no power in Abbotsford to land flying from Edmonton. But yet there was a family on the other side saying there was power and weather was fine. We had to book a hotel in the airport, Swoop said they cant pay the hotel or send on another flight because it was weather. No more flights for the day. But WestJet who owns Swoop is still flying into Abbotsford even an hour after ours! Now out a day travel, work and have to pay hotel! Nice lies Swoop, blame weather so all us people are stuck paying out of our pocket!

### "Swoop doesn't care about their customers at all"
Not Verified |  I arrived at the Hamilton airport at approximately 7.55am for my 8.45am flight to Edmonton on February 14th, 2021. It took me a few moments to get out of my vehicle and get into the airport. When I entered the airport there was a line, there was one man in front of me and 2 other people who entered after me. The man in front of me was checked-in and walked away, and I approached the desk to check myself in, but was told I was too late. It was approximately 8.03am. The disturbing and unacceptable thing is that the guy in front of me could enter, yet myself and the people behind me were not. Beyond this, I had no bags to check (just a carry on), the flight was delayed 10 minutes, and it was the only flight to leave the airport on February 14th, the airport was dead quiet! The employee I spoke to was disrespectful, hostile, and rude. He wore no identification to suggest we worked for Swoop, and was wearing a very unsuitable mask (it was a kerchief). He showed no leniency or pity for our situation, though the middle-aged man with an infant’s car seat in front of the three of us was shown plenty of leniency. I am a young female university student, so was the other girl behind me in line, and the guy in line was also a young university student. I would be willing to venture that this abuse of power could be related to ageism or a bias. The employee basically told us that we were out of luck and we would have to rebook our flight. I am not sure why this guy did not offer to see if we needed transportation, if we had a place to stay, or even pretend to care that he had just left three young university students with wasted money and out of luck. We were left feeling helpless and angry just for being mere minutes 'late'. The employee walked away from us without offering any kind of help or support, and I went to talk to a security agent who advised us to wait until after our flight had left and other Swoop agents could help us rebook our flight or accept a voucher. We waited for nearly two hours by the Swoop check-in desk, but no one came to help us. I ended up having to call someone to come speak to us. The same employee that refused to check us in arrived and told us there was nothing he could do, that we would have to call Swoop’s line to rebook or receive credit, which I did, and was told by the agent I spoke to over the phone that because I missed my flight there would be no kind of reimbursement. The way I was treated was horrible and unfair. I feel like I have been robbed, and I was denied my first flight home to Alberta since moving to Ontario in September. I am extremely disappointed in Swoop and the Hamilton airport. If you value good customer service, actually getting on the plane, and not being robbed, do not fly Swoop. If you have to travel during the pandemic, fly Flair, they actually allow refunds for COVID related matters, as well as changes to bookings up to 24 hours before your flight. Swoop doesn't care about their customers at all.

### "Very disappointing and ridiculous in the face of Covid-19 restrictions"
Not Verified |  Interestingly enough I never got on the Swoop flight in February 2021! I was supposed to fly home from BC on Swoop, but was unable to fly to BC because of ON and BC inter-provincial travel restrictions. Despite the restrictions that prevented me from going to BC, Swoop was happy to eat my $260 (including 1 carry-on and 1 checked bag!) fee I paid in September 2020! Very disappointing and ridiculous in the face of Covid-19 restrictions! It's garbage policies and practices like this that encourage people to break the Covid-19 regulations! It literally cost me $260 to follow the provincial rules!

### "thank you for your terrible lack of compassion for your clients"
Not Verified |  I had booked to escort our college kid to ONT from AB and was a NEW Swoop customer. I was a bit worried her schooling would be postponed (it was) so I booked one way with her and one way without and had the foresight to pay for Modifly on the way there but forgot to do this on the return for husband and I. I called Swoop and wondered if this was an issue. No it was not, until I did have to change. I changed the flights going there, no problem. But, when I had to change our return ones (the ones I had not paid for Modifly but was told no problem), I ended up paying for the flights all over again for even more money than if I had just rebooked new flights and not told them. What was to be a $279 set of tickets to return was $620.66. Wow, why wasn't I told this when I called in to verify? So please, if you have to cancel don't change the flight allowing them to sell your ticket again. Just let them fly it empty as you will pay for more than twice the cost fly anyways. I would have been better to just book again and swallow the first amount. What a rip off in a time we were trying to save rent money for our kid. Thanks Swoop. I won't mention how much of my money Westjet has in their "travel account" for flights that had to be cancelled last May. Once again, thank you for your terrible lack of compassion for your clients.

### "things were handled in a very professional and courteous manner"
Our flight #106 from Abbotsford, BC to Hamilton, ON on January 21, 2021 was postponed due to mechanical issues. The Swoop staff did an amazing job in keeping us informed in a very timely manner. We were instructed that we would be put up in a nearby hotel but that transportation and food would be reimbursed when we returned home. The staff was very polite and it was unfortunate that a few very rude passengers upset everyone. The manager in charge tried to calm these individuals but to no avail. I think that security should have been called in to remove them from the airport as soon as they became belligerent with the Swoop staff. All in all things were handled in a very professional and courteous manner.

### "Good job on losing customers"
Same airline. Same personal bag. Same contents. On the way to Toronto there were no issues. On the way back suddenly my personal bag is considered a carry on and had to pay $73.50. I just paid to avoid immediate retaliation to prevent me from flying. Watch out for the staff member at the Toronto check in counter who insisted that I have a carry on even though I told them that’s how I came. Good job on losing customers. Won’t fly again.

### "unimpressed with my first Swoop experience"
I missed the baggage check cut off by 4 minutes. Despite dozens of emails from Swoop telling me to purchase more baggage at no point was I told that the baggage check in cut off was at the time it was, not even when I purchased the baggage in advance. When I got the desk, the lady said, “you can’t check it in because you missed cut off but if you leave the bag you can still board the flight.” I was visibly stressed about this and their agent was zero help. She didn’t say a word after that, except “no refunds”. I wasn’t offered any sort of assistance to get the bag added to a later flight or check a smaller sized bag as a carry on. Called customer support after my flight and they said that since there are no refunds period, that I can’t even have the bag accredited for a future flight and couldn’t have offered to have it brought on another flight. Absolutely unimpressed with my first Swoop experience and their lack of support, accommodation, and advanced information to have even helped prevent that from happening. Prior to this, they changed my flights completely and moved both the departure and return flight by a day. On top of that, they announced their final boarding call 20 minutes before the boarding time! I saw a man completely miss his flight because of it and I was cutting it close. Yeah it was a cheap flight but these three inconveniences were not minor and will not be using Swoop again, nor recommending it.

### "extremely kind and helpful"
I absolutely hate flying and was very anxious, it was a very bumpy flight, and the flight attendants were extremely kind and helpful. They brought me whatever I asked for and moved me to the front of the plane so that I’d feel less of the turbulence. Super kind and friendly staff on the flight.

### "I did not receive any communication"
I booked this flight to Edmonton to visit my family over the holidays early in November, before the Ontario and Alberta lockdowns due to Covid 19 were announced. Closer to my flight, I got in touch with my family doctor to express my concern about travelling from Ontario to the red zone that Edmonton was in at the time and he advised against my travels due to my respiratory issues. So I emailed Swoop customer service on December 13th letting them that I didn't feel comfortable traveling and I would like the option to get a credit for my flight on file - they suggested that I move my dates. Unfortunately, I didn't know when it would be safe for me to travel again as I had a medical note from my doctor advising against my travel for the time being. Swoop said that they cannot do anything about this and that I had to proceed with my flight or change the dates - I tried to change my dates but I had to pay 2.5x more on top of my initial flight cost to move dates to a date that I was pulling from thin air. I then sent my doctors note to the customer service agents, 72 hours before my flight, asking again for credit to be able to travel with Swoop again and I did not receive a response. I followed up again at 48 hours and again at 24 hours prior and no response - until finally I sent a lengthy email outright threatening that I would file this complaint if I didn't hear back from them to which they replied saying that their policies were the cornerstone of their operation and that I should have informed them 72 hours in advance of my flight. I mentioned to the agent that I travel often for business and to visit my family so this would not be the last of my travels, hoping a loyalty clause in their policies would apply, but again I did not receive any communication. I know that I will not get my money back but I am hoping that filing this will add up to what other complaints are out there for change to take place.

### "having to pay for another bag"
I understand what a no frills airline is. And I understand the need to make money. Worst airline I’ve encountered. Customer service = 2/10 (There were some nice people - but their overall customer service was garbage). I paid for a bag on my way back. I accidentally chose the option for a carry on instead of a check-in. (Both options are the same price) Yes, I did make a mistake. After speaking with the desk staff as well as calling swoop to see if there was anyway to make that change. I was told there is “no way to make that change”. Ended up having to pay for another bag to be checked in. At the end of it all. I would have been better of paying a reliable airline. It would have actually worked put cheaper.

### "Worst service I've ever gotten with an airline"
Not Verified |  Worst service I've ever gotten with an airline. Tried to contact for about week before a flight through all of their recommended means, but they never contacted me back. Four different people tried on three separate occasions to contact via phone. When we finally got a hold of a representative, they were rude and wanted to charge basically the cost of the flight for changes. A dismal customer service representative.

### "punished for cancelling my flight"
I should not be punished for cancelling my flight at the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic. My flight was to Fort Lauderdale Florida, by the way. Which was a serious concern and had I had gone I would have been forced to return back the Ontario anyway. Swoop is not fooling anyone. We know you want government support. We know you are only giving refund to “eligible” flights/customers or the government would not be giving you that support. =

### "recommend not booking through Swoop"
Not Verified |  I would recommend not booking through Swoop during uncertain times, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Not offering flexibility during this time is completely unacceptable. I tried in every way possible, in the kindest manner possible, to reschedule my flight for a year from now or receive a credit, and they have left me with no option but to forfeit my flight. It is a tone-deaf, greedy approach to a difficult time for many people trying to travel to see loved ones and making the responsible decision to postpone. I purchased Modifly at an extra cost to be able to rebook my flight if need be and they only offer you re-booking within four months. It's a total waste of money. I'm extremely disappointed and will not be choosing swoop nor recommending them to any one I know ever again.

### "I will never book again a flight with Swoop"
I am not happy. I did 10 flight reservations in November 2020 during "Black Friday". 6 flights were cancelled December 1st. I did not succeed to change one cancelled flight to January 19 2020. Swoop is asking me now for $100 to change it to January 19, 2020 when Swoop cancelled my first reservation. I called Swoop centre and lady was not helping me and was laughing. I regret to have booked 10 travels with Swoop, I should have book them with another company. I will never book again a flight with Swoop.

### "We are very unhappy"
We are very unhappy. We booked tickets with swoop from Hamilton to Edmonton leaving Nov 26/20. Alberta government mandated a lockdown the evening of Nov 24/20. I have been told that we cannot get a credit for the flight because it was not changed 24 hours prior to take off. How were we to know that the province of Alberta would be locked down? We didn't have 24 hours notice to change the flights! When booking, we paid the extra to change tickets because of the way things are these days with Covid19 and all of the uncertainty. We can change our return ticket only, great. What good do return tickets from Edmonton do us? We are now out of pocket over $600 and very upset about it. This is not how you do business my friends, this is not how you keep customers coming back!

### "all they really care about is money"
Not Verified |  The entire baggage policy is a scam. Swoop claims to be a budget airline but all they really care about is money, not their customers. Pressuring people to purchase baggage options months in advance for ridiculously expensive fees (which is how they make their flights look "cheap") and charging the same obscene fee for a carry-on as they do for a checked bag - scam. Also, pressuring you to purchase ahead of time because they will increase it $74 per bag at check in - this is a terrible policy and other airlines do not do this which is why they are superior. Their customer service is apathetic and unwilling to cooperate. They don't care about losing customers, only about making money. They refuse to give refunds so customer beware. I would never recommend flying with them over any other Canadian airline. Not worth the extra five dollars you think you're saving before all the extra fees come in.

### "lack of customer service"
Not Verified | I am absolutely stunned at the lack of customer service. I booked a ticket from Edmonton to Toronto to fly home for surgery. I had to postpone the ticket, due to delays in the medical system from COVID19, all this went fine but then I moved home permanently by car a few weeks before my new scheduled date. I contacted them to request a refund or barring that a voucher for use at another time. They told me flat out no, with several weeks notice. I called them again and asked if I could just change the flights to allow me to go from Ontario to Edmonton at a later date, also no. I called them a third time and asked them if I could change the name on the flight, to allow my daughter to come to visit me. same flights, same times, just change the passenger. Again, no. there is nothing I can do besides abandon the ticket and flush the money down the toilet.

### "zero customer service"
In June 2020, I booked return flights for my three kids to visit me from Edmonton to Abbotsford. A few days later, kids plan changed due to changes in their summer school schedule. Now two of them could not fly on planned dates while one was able to travel as planned. I called SWOOP several times to make necessary changes but they declined to make any changes. I offered to pay additional money as a differential however, they still declined. I paid $665 for their trip and for this amount only one of my kids traveled which caused me a big financial hit just because of inflexible stubborn policies and attitude of SWOOP’s management. Unfortunately to fly from Edmonton to Abbotsford options is very limited. SWOOP has a monopoly for this route which leads them to show total inflexibly and zero customer service.

### "suggest that cheap is never better"
We’re from Vancouver and we travelled to Abbotsford to fly via Swoop to Edmonton. Our flight was supposed to be at 7:45 p.m. on June 26th, 2020. We arrived 40 minutes early for our flight and upon arrival, there were no employees in the check-in booths. We go to baggage security at the gate and they ask for a boarding pass, we explain that there are no attendees at the check-in booths and that we only received an itinerary via email after checking ourselves in online (we only had carry-on bags) - they mentioned that for some reason, on a daily basis, somebody has an issue with Swoop and that they were not allowed to communicate to their staff directly when a customer requests so. The security at the gate suggests we call their customer service line but when we do, nobody picks up. We notice a young gentleman waiting at the check-in booths for assistance, I ask him what time his flight is and what whether he had a boarding pass. He explains to me that he only received an itinerary via email and that he also needed assistance for a boarding pass. I go back to the gate and I hear a Swoop employee asking the security at the gate what the commotion is all about, they explain that there are three passengers trying to get on and they ask her “Did you want to speak to them?” She chuckles sarcastically and says “No - close the gates!” Security then kicks us out as they apologize. I head quickly back to the check-in booths and wait for the employees to head out. When they come out to collect their personal belongings on the counters, they simply DO NOT CARE. They say it’s policy that we must be there exactly and hour before our flight and if nobody is there, they will no longer accommodate for whatever reason. They also say that it is our responsibility to search for a barcode - however, we explain that how would we know the requirements when it’s not even clearly communicated by Swoop itself? How would we know that a barcode was necessary if this is our first time? Their next response is to purchase a new ticket for June 27th and speak to their customer service line (we called twice and the call drops right after the menu option). The employees then ask for our last name and says “Yes, I’ve seen your name but you’re supposed to arrive 2 hours early”. The employees all pack up and leave. I suggest that cheap is never better. As of for the employees at Swoop, a kind heart goes a long way. It doesn’t cost an arm to assist customers to get where they are needed.

### "5 minutes late for my flight"
Edmonton to Hamilton. I was 5 minutes late for my flight departure at 3:10pm. The told me we can’t get you in. I ask for tomorrow flight they told me to buy another ticket.

### "no complaints whatsoever"
Abbostford to Hamilton on 10 April. I just flew swoop 4 times in March. Everything was smooth. I'll definitely fly with them again. It's a budget airline but no complaints whatsoever. Looking forward to my next flight in May 2020.

### "gave no explanation at all"
Not Verified |  Got my flight to Winnipeg. Originally  was suppose to go back home in may 27th. About a week in to my trip I received a message that my flight was cancelled. I was forced to move to june 1st. This didn't work for me but I had no choice. They gave no explanation at all. Today April 29th, 2020, I got another message that my rescheduled flight was cancelled again and I can take the same day flight but instead of direct and a 2.5 hour flight it goes to a transferred flight and a 10 hour flight. Unbelievable. So I thought I would call. No! If you want to speak with some one it costs $15 plus taxes to call.

### "will not be reimbursed"
Our flight between Edmonton and Los Cabos was cancelled by Swoop in January 2020. Swoop emailed stating that if we re-booked with an alternate carrier they would reimburse us. Four months later we are now being told that because we did not re-book with Westjet (the only approved alternate carrier) we will not be reimbursed. Their email specifically states that we can book with an 'alternate carrier'. It does not say that the alternate carrier had to be Westjet, yet that is why we are being denied our refund. This company is unethical and cannot be trusted.

### "could not get hold of anyone at Swoop"
Not Verified |  We used to really like flying with Swoop but Our return flight was Scheduled Mar 23 2020 from Orlando to Edmonton but due to the Coronavirus and government saying to get home in case the borders get closed we decided to reschedule a return to Edmonton on Mar 16. We could not get a hold of anyone at Swoop for any advice as to what to do - just a recording saying they were too busy to take calls not even a option to leave a contact phone number to have them call me back. I ended up paying over $600 for 2 of us to get back to Edmonton. Now our regular tickets that were for Mar 23 are lost with no option even for a credit that we could use later. This in not right Swoop!

### "do not care about their customer"
Las Vegas to Edmonton. This airline should not be getting a dime from the government when it is not refunding or given full credits to the people that have their flights canceled. They make you use their modify and pick dates right there. No one should ever use this airline as they do not care about their customers. Please do not use this airline.

### "unable to reach anyone by phone"
Not Verified | Terrible service! Our flight from Mesa to Edmonton and the return flight in May were cancelled due to the Coronavirus outbreak and subsequent closing of the U.S./Canada border. We are now unable to travel to Canada and Swoop refuses to issue anything other than Swoop credit. Edmonton is the only destination they fly to out of Mesa - lot of good credit will do. They seem to feel entitled to my money while not providing anything on their end. I understand the outbreak is outside their control but a simple refund is appropriate for this unusual situation. I am unable to reach anyone by phone. The call just ends saying that no one is available and hangs up.

### "shift in their customer service"
Hamilton to Halifax. I have flown Swoop many times in the past few years, but have seen a real shift in their customer service. In light of a global pandemic, I was appalled at a couple of practices that seemed like safety oversights that negate the government mandate for social distancing. When time to board, they called "General Boarding Call", instead of by zone or by row, which resulted in all passengers cramming up to the counter. The plane was 1/2 full, but their seating algorithm placed everyone at the back of the plane (because they want to charge extra for seats up front). Both of these areas could easily be improved at times like this: Stagger boarding, back of plane to front. Wave seating fees and aim to have 1 person per row, or at least seats between them. C'mon Swoop, this is easy stuff.

### "stay away from this airline"
Abbotsford to Hamilton. Swoop has displayed very poor business practices during this global crisis. I booked in March 2020 this year, before any case of the covid19. On March 20. I decided to cancel due to our civic duty to not engage in non-essential travel in order to help stop the spread of COVID19. We’ve been contacting Swoop, but it all ended up in a recording that they cannot attend to our call, then line cuts. Even the chat doesn’t help, message sent hasn’t answered. For the return flight, which is more than 7 days ahead, their new policy claim they give free to modify, but no, they still charging $100 per head for the change. This is the worst airline I have seen so far as the refund is concerned. My advice is to stay away from this airline.

### "Giving Swoop a thumbs up"
Not Verified | Mazatlan to Edmonton. Dear Swoop, thank you so much for all you did getting my parents home from Mexico during this time! You were amazing during this all and they had absolutely nothing bad to say about Swoop and actually said it was one of the best flights they have been on! Thanks again and hats off to you picking up the slack of WestJet and going above and beyond! Giving Swoop a thumbs up!

### "very poor business practices"
Abbotsford to Hamilton. Swoop has displayed very poor business practices during this global crisis. We booked in last year, before any case of the covid19. On March 13, only learned 2 days before our flight Mar.15, we decided to cancel due to our civic duty to not engage in non-essential travel in order to help stop the spread of COVID19. We’ve been contacting Swoop, but it all ended up in a recording that they cannot attend to our call, then line cuts. Even the chat doesn’t help, message sent hasn’t answered. For the return flight, which is more than 7 days ahead, their new policy claim they give free to modify, but no, they still charging $100 per head for the change and also jack up the price so you have to pay for the huge difference. I am extremely disappointed that the airline is not willing to issue Swoop credits for flights within Canada. It is absolutely appalling that Swoop is not offering travel credits or re-booking options for its customers amidst the Coronavirus health crisis/pandemic. The government is telling us to cancel all travel so we basically do not have a choice but to cancel and Swoop is a shame to use this time to promote cheaper prices.

### "we get no response to email and can't reach them on the phone"
Not Verified |  Due to Covid19 virus and the risk in taking this vacation, we as a group decided to cancel. 3 hrs and 20 minutes waiting on the phone with Swoop Getaway the company we booked with. 2 payments were charged to my Mastercard, 1 was Expedia and the other was Swoop. The Rep for Swoop Getaways stated due to the "uncontrollable" acts the flights maybe be credited to Swoop credits or a full refund to the original form of payment. The Expedia charged was refunded in full, and the Swoop was refunded as "shell" after researching this means credit. As stated in Swoops website "Uncontrollable" a customer has the option of a credit or a full refund. Now we get no response to email and can't reach them on the phone. Please dont support a company that doesn't suppose their customers or follow their own policies. Also will not give WestJet a dime as they are the parent company of Swoop.

### "terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Abbotsford to Puerto Vallarta. Have now been on hold for 2 hours with Swoop. Trying to cancel as per their email regarding Corona. Cant cancel online, cant get anyone online, cant get anyone via email, and have now wasted 2 hours on phone which Im sure will disconnect any minute. This is not the first time Swoop. You offer terrible customer service and Westjet your parent company should be ashamed of themselves.

### "the worst airline out there"
Not Verified |  Swoop has been nothing but insensitive and has displayed very poor business practices during this global crisis. My husband I were travelling to Edmonton with our two young children. When we decided to cancel due to our civic duty to not engage in non essential travel in order to help stop the spread of COVID19 swop was not there to answer a phone call. They wanted to charge us $15 to talk to a human, their online chat didn’t help and we could not access them via email. Swoop wanted to charge us $1200 to change our flights. Swoop is by far the worst airline out there. I’ve never flown with them and after this experience I never will furthermore I have told many never to fly with them and I have shared my experience with others. I am disgusted by swoop and I hope others tell their story because I know I am not the only one that is out hundreds of dollars due to their insensitivity and poor business practices.

### "Stay far, far, away"
Not Verified | Abbotsford to Edmonton. Horrible, horrible, horrible Don't go, stay away. We booked in Feb, before all the covid19 lockdowns. Only learned 4 days before flight Mar.15, that we had to isolate. Have been trying to reach them but no response. When you phone, line goes dead after 1 ring. Out $1700.00 because we couldn't cancel or reschedule. Never once had an update. You can only change your reservation 7 days prior to flight. Gov. changed rules 6 days before flight. Swoop does not care about you. Stay far, far, away.

### "never been able to get through"
Hamilton to Fort Lauderdale. We were to fly out March 13, 2020. We have tried to get hold of Swoop for days (before the 7 day period) and have never been able to get through. We booked with our WestJet card and were told by WestJet to contact our carrier which is Swoop. We had to cancel as my dr recommended with virus we don't go as i have lupus. I get that they are probably going out of their minds with calls but other airlines have let people cancel in light of the virus. If this many people are complaining and losing money perhaps other means to get our money will need to be considered. This is not our fault, we only are trying to help ourselves to avoid what was the obvious.

### "very satisfied with our service"
Winnipeg to Abbotsford. Our plane got grounded due to unforeseen safety maintenance. We called the customer service and spoke to Desiree. She was so helpful and patient. She got us on a flight with Westjet that afternoon with no hiccups or bumps. We were very satisfied with our service and the way Desiree dealt with our undesirable circumstances.

### "jacked up the price"
Not Verified | Cancun to London. The date is March 16th. I am with my family in Cancun and just heard the Prime Minister's address asking all Canadian's to come home due to covid19. I wanted to change my Swoop flights from Saturday to an earlier flight on Thursday and Swoop would not do the change. I had to buy new tickets and take travel vouchers in order to get home. Additionally, while I was booking the flights they jacked up the price! Unbelievable!

### "Swoop are charging $150 per head "
Edmonton to London. Our flight is Today March 17, 2020. From Edmonton to London Ontario through (Swoop) then from London Ontario to Orlando through Sunwing Airlines. Sunwing gave us a full refund but We’ve been contacting Swoop service lots of time Since March 12, but it all ended up in a recording apologizing that they cannot attend to our call, then line cuts. Even the chat doesn’t help, email haven’t answered. On cancellation Swoop are charging $150 per head which is a lot bigger than the fare, and changing flight dates they are charging to-and-fro $150+$100 per head, so, the use of Modifly is for the next flight after you charge up this huge amount? Be considerate enough to all your clients, being in a local flights doesn’t mean you are not subject to viral infection. I hope you can do something about this and not just wait for your clients/pasenger to not show up in threir flight just to protect themselves from being exposed to infection, then what, it’s your gain and we lose.

### "not willing to issue credits"
Hamilton to Edmonton. I am extremely disappointed that the airline is not willing to issue Swoop credits for flights within Canada. There are some people that are more at risk for catching Covid-19 and given the progression of this ILLness it should not matter where you are flying to.

### "I could not reach a live agent"
After re-booking a flight from Orlando to Hamilton with a live agent, I was promised a $50.00 credit off the ticket price for my next flight with Swoop. When I tried to apply this credit on a flight to Cancun, After waiting on hold for over an hour, I could not reach a live agent to receive it. I tried contacting an agent through the Swoop website to no avail. Never received a response to my written request to Swoop. What I find disturbing is the complete lack of care to help customers deal with flagrant issues. Swoop is a subsidiary of Westjet, one of the more popular and successful air carriers in Canada. I have never had an issue in all the years I have flown Westjet. How is it Westjet has not become involved with Swoop management to iron out these customer complaints? I have come that Swoop cannot survive the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.

### "they charge for water"
Not Verified |  Everything was overpriced. I ended up not bothering to get a drink on the flight, since they charge for water. There is no In-flight entertainment, there is a Swoop app that you can download, which has a streaming service there, which you need to pay for WiFi to use. Ended up paying nearly 15 bucks for the in-flight WiFi which didn't work for me. Couldn't connect to anything that wasn't on the Swoop website. I had to go to safari on my phone to connect and pay, not the Swoop app. Top it off with having zero legroom, my knees squished up against the seat in front of me. I am never going to fly with Swoop again.

### "no one is responsive"
I'm writing this from London Ontario Airport. A small airport which due to coronavirus now you hardly see anyone around. Our flight was at 12:25 pm and when I got to the airport many students were in the line in front of the Swoop counter and no employee was there. When one person finally came, she said they don't check in anymore. The flight is here hardly anyone in the airport and they didn't check in us while at 11:40 neither of them was in counter. It is not our fault that they left the counter earlier than usual times because they didn't have any travelers. The supervisor was not responsive and just kept showing a paper with a phone number. Is this called customer service? I tried to call many times and no one is responsive. This is not fair to customers. Most of the kids who lost their flight today at London airport were students who were forced to leave the residents due to universities closing because of the Coronavirus and now they have nowhere to go.

### "cannot get through on the phone"
My 87 year-old mother & I booked a flight to Edmonton from Hamilton to leave March 20 and return March 24. On March 13 the airline announced that if your flight was more than 7 days away you could add their flight insurance for free and change or suspend your travel plans. Our trip was just under 7 days away! Also our flight was not an international flight but it was between two of the provinces with the highest rates of confirmed cases and also between two cities which have confirmed cases. We are asking that they reconsider and allow us to receive a credit so that we can reschedule or trip to see my sister and her ailing husband. He had COPD and is also very susceptible to the virus. Even the government has told us to avoid non-essential travel! I have yet to hear back from the Facebook messages that I have sent and cannot get through on the phone.

### "pay for every single little thing"
Edmonton to Las Vegas. I would not recommend anyone flying with Swoop! Yes, they say their flights are cheaper but are they? At the end of the day, we have to pay for every single little thing including bad service and delays over delays! So the world announces a pandemic and everyone is trying to cancel their flight to get their money back so their health is not at risk and to prevent the spread of the virus not only does Swoop charge to speak to them but currently Swoop won’t even pick up calls or when they did pick up they say sorry we don’t refund for flights-no refund policy, not even world pandemic. Perhaps a credit? Shouldn’t this be an exception? WestJet and Air Canada are also credit or refunding customers. Even the government is paying people to stay at home and not travel. The hotel we booked even made an exception and refunded our money even tho they had a no refund policy understanding the situation. Shame!

### "it is impossible to communicate"
Not Verified |  From the early hours of today and taking into account the measures announced by Canada due to the coronavirus, we decided to cancel or modify our flight reservation to the city of Hamilton for March 15 from the city of Tampa, Florida, USA. The option to cancel or modify the flight does not work! We tried to call but it is impossible to communicate and we also saw that the charges for those calls are $15. Therefore, we are requesting the cancellation of our reservation and the refund of our total payment. We will be going tomorrow to a counter, to do a new complaint!

### "trying to modify or cancel our flight"
Not Verified |  Tampa to Hamilton. Since yesterday March 13 we have been trying to modify or cancel our flight reservation to Canada. The option to cancel or modify the flight does not work! So we are requesting the cancellation of our reservation and that the total of our payment be re-sent to us.

### "not a low cost airline"
Edmonton to Los Cabos on 14 March. Avoid, avoid, avoid! This is not a low cost airline and then they refuse to even discuss with you! As someone used to low cost airlines in Europe, this does not compare!

### "never get my business again"
Hamilton to Halifax. Flight booked to Halifax for Easter weekend and I am a health care provider. Cannot believe there is no way to get even a travel voucher in place of the flight I cannot take. They also need to stop sending "reminders" to pay for seats and baggage to patrons who have already paid. I fell for that once. And only once. Swoop will never get my business again. I chose it because it flies non-stop from Hamilton. Will take the extra trouble in the future to fly out of Toronto with other carriers. Good riddance.

### "not offering travel credits"
Not Verified |  It is absolutely appalling that Swoop are not offering travel credits or re-booking options for their customers amidst the Coronavirus health crisis/pandemic. The government is telling us to cancel all travel so we basically do not have a choice but to cancel and Swoop Airlines is so selfish to use this time to promote cheaper prices.

### "Swoop are not accommodating anyone"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Puerto Vallarta. We are cancelling our vacation to Mexico mainly because we have a 2 week old grandson. Our hotel were more than accommodating, however, we booked with Swoop and they are not accommodating anyone. They are charging $15.00 to speak to a representative. This is disgraceful. We are currently experiencing high call volumes To save you money, we suggest using Manage My Bookings for booking, cancellations or changes. If you would like to speak to a Swoop agent there is a fee of $15 plus applicable taxes for new reservations or to change your existing reservation.

### "Swoop will not let us cancel"
Not Verified |  Edmonton to Puerto Vallarta. Canadian government advising not to travel internationally. Swoop will not let us cancel, change or give us credit. Other air carriers are flexing their policies to accommodate during this Coronavirus crisis. Shame on you Swoop! Never use you again.

### "disappointed with this company"
Not Verified |  Winnipeg to Hamilton. Due to the COVID-19 pandamic I tried to change my flight to a different date but was overly charged, more than the original amount I paid. I can't afford to change dates. If your company truly does have compassion, flight change would have been accepted due to the pandemic. I am very disappointed with this company for taking my hard earned money.

### "Bad customer service"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Winnipeg. Bad customer service. They keep delaying our flight, they gave us less then 24 hrs notice this is not acceptable. Flights are cheap but never gonna fly with them again. I tried to call them many times but they never pick up the phone they put me on hold for 1 hr but I never hear any voice.

### "I want to thank the crew"
This past year has certainly been a challenge for Swoop. Nevertheless, despite the complaints, my wife and I decided to abandon our loyalty to Westjet over the past 15 years and try Swoop. Having the pleasure to live only 15 minutes from the Hamilton airport, and a reduced price, were key factors in our decision. We booked our February vacation to Jamaica last September and have been watching the reviews on a daily basis. Although the company has had some trying times, it's fair to say that even new companies have hiccups along the way. We booked our flight for February 8th, flying out of Hamilton to Mo Bay. Our crew on flight WO672 went beyond what we as a customer expect. Not only did they do their best to make you comfortable, they were efficient, friendly, smiles all around and courteous. Best decision we made. On our return flight which was February 29th flight WO673, once again we had a very smooth flight home. We had a different crew on board this time - friendly, professional employees. I want to thank the crew of both flights, for providing such great customer service. Not only did we save on the airfare, we saved on the transportation to Pearson as well, and we had a fantastic flight. On our flight and transportation to the airport, we saved 40% of what it would have cost us to fly out of Pearson.

### "cannot cancel my booking"
Hamilton to Las Vegas. I can’t describe just how disappointed I am with Swoop. Today is my fiancé’s birthday, so I surprised him with a trip to Vegas to watch the UFC my mistake you ask? Booking with Swoop airline. At 11:37 am I was notified that my 7:45pm flight had been delayed to 9:30pm due to “weather”. Okay fine, lots of notice, I won’t leave home too early. I get to Hamilton airport and find out my flight will be delayed an additional 10 minutes making it a 9:40 departure. No problem, we will still make it to our event, we were feeling sorry for the Domestic flight before us with swoop that was cancelled. 9:43pm rolls around and the screens say my flight has departed. What the fuck? Nope the staff say it has just arrived and they are preparing it for us. After all other flights from Hamilton & Toronto have departed these guys announce that our flight has been cancelled. Chaos broke in that tiny airport. None of the staff had any information to give. Helpful really at 10:30 at night. So we are exhausted and angry now. We were told everyone would receive a 100% refund if we chose not to fly on the next available flight. That flight is 24 hours away and means we not only miss out on tonight’s hotel that we have paid for (which I later found out was due to mechanical issues) but we would also miss the UFC. We booked another flight with another reputable airline that actually flies passengers and doesn’t just rob them and cancel flights. I got the email that I supposedly could “accept changes” or “cancel” and get a full refund. The icing on the cake, I cannot cancel my booking and get a refund at all. It’s simply not an option. Swoop is unprofessional, their staff don’t know how to handle stressful situations.

### "You won't save money"
Ft Lauderdale to Hamilton. This carrier allows only one child item per reservation, not per child. So a family gets stuck paying for legally required items like car seats and essential items like a stroller. I have never once encountered this. What a terrible way to treat families. Have a question or problem? Good luck! Swoop's chat was a joke and they charge $15+tax to speak to someone on the phone. Their check in process was the nail in the coffin. Virtually no staff. After standing in one of two lines for some time, someone finally came and told about 50 people they were in the wrong line. After we all shuffled over, they only processed the one line and held everyone else. The line was backed up out the doors of the terminal. First and last time I make the mistake of flying this airline. You won't save money. You won't save time. You won't save headaches. Hoping they seriously reform their business model or go out of business.

### "realize this is a discount carrier"
Edmonton to Abbotsford. This is, by far, the worst airline I’ve ever had the displeasure of flying . They are non time and every person I dealt with was unhelpful and borderline rude. I thought Flair was bad, but sadly I long for Flair after these recent experiences. Unfortunately, Swoop crushed Flair and they are ceasing flights to my destination. My advice to anyone even considering flying Swoop, spend a few extra dollars and fly a real airline. I realize that this is a discount carrier, but seriously?

### "one of the best flights"
Flight from Edmonton to Mazatlan was bang on, no problems whatsoever. Was worried due to the reviews but it was one of the best flights I have been on. An hour delay coming home, not a big deal, I have dealt with way worse on other airlines. The flight attendants were very friendly. Don’t listen to the whiners, they want a champagne flight on a beer budget. If you can’t afford $50 to upgrade your seat do us all a favour and stay home. Swoop is half the cost of other airlines. If you want the princess treatment book another airline, and if you can’t afford that don’t go on vacation.

### "waited two hours and never got my bag"
Swoop made my first ever solo flight woeful. It has been 5 days since I landed back home in Edmonton, AB from Abbotsford, BC and Swoop still hasn’t got back to me. I went to British Columbia for a snowboarding trip and was iffy about my baggage getting lost and I wasn’t wrong. My snowboard reached BC no problem but it did not return with me and swoop airlines does not have the decency to even get back to me. I paid to check in my bags and paid for insurance. When I landed in Edmonton I waited two hours and never got my bag. I filled a missing bag report the night I landed, I waited on the phone for an hour which was never picked up with swoop the next morning, and I finally sent them an email the same day as the phone call which was four days ago and still not a sound from them. What’s a company without customer care? What’s a company that doesn’t get back to you?

### "it was great"
I flew from London to Abbotsford with Swoop and back and it was great! My wife and I flew with our infant son on our lap and each flight they gave us our own row despite not choosing our seats. They also allowed us to have a personal (diaper) bag even though we didn't pay for a seat for our son.

### "don’t have approved ETA"
Orlando to Edmonton. They deny passengers to board anytime with the excuse that you don’t have approved ETA, even though we had showed on paper. We drove 5 hours to take the flight & at the gate, they told us you can not board the flight & won’t get any refund. Called & emailed several times but never got our money. Reported to the Department of Air transportation but no use.

### "Extremely poor customer service"
Edmonton to Orlando. Have been attempting to speak to Swoop regarding an upcoming flight. Their chat app takes hours for anyone to respond. They advised in the last message to me to call them. I spent 36 minutes on hold (no toll free number provided) at which time I was disconnected by their system. Extremely poor customer service.

### "Overall a great experience"
Hamilton to Tampa. We had seen mixed reviews of Swoop so were a little nervous flying with our family of 7. We had no delays and flights were smooth without issue. We saved about $1000 vs flying with other airlines. Leg room seemed a little bit less than other Canadian airlines. The only issue we had is staff at departure in Hamilton were a little rude, but it seemed like maybe the employee had been having a bad day. My husband overheard her talking about a guest blasting her for something. Overall a great experience and we’d definitely fly Swoop again.

### "cannot let us board since gates are closed"
Edmonton to London. I had flight with 2 month old baby, flight got delayed at first and they switched it to WestJet, we were notified 4 hours before. No Gate number on boarding pass, wrong flight on boarding pass shown. When they switched they missed to transfer my Baby's ticket. When we got hold up by security, they didn't announce name. Finally after all this, we still made it to gate, they said they cannot let us board since gates are closed. Just turned their back, did not help to find alternative flight or could have let us in. They don't care about you, once they got money, done. I would suggest to pay more and get better one. Our baggage was sent and we didn't have anything since we are moving to ON with whole place.

### "staff  at Swoop check-in rude to us"
Hamilton to Cancun. We got up early and got to airport on time. When we got there, the staff  working at the Swoop check-in were rude to us. They tried to make us feel it was our mistake that we did not know the flight was delayed for 8 hours and 40 minutes. They said we got an email and we checked but we had not got an email. They did not offer any vouchers or anything for a delay of almost 9 hours! This airport is also dirty, coming is trying to find parking is difficult, better signage is required. This is an awful airport.

### "missed my flight from Edmonton"
If you are flying Swoop ensure you are at least two hours early or else you will miss your flight. I showed up 105 mins early and missed my flight from Edmonton which I understand is my fault for not showing up before the recommended 120 mins. That was only the start to my troubles with swoop. I booked another flight with Westjet down to phoenix and still had my return flight with swoop home. Swoop sent me an email on the Friday (day after missed flight) stating if I did not reply to it within 24 hours they would cancel my prepaid return flight. I had lost my phone and had no way to reply to this message. I did my due diligence to check my emails Monday, two days before my flight, but it was already cancelled. So panicking I checked swoops flights and there was an opening on the same flight heading home. I called them asap and was charged $15 and put on hold for well over an hour. When I got ahold of the airline I explained my situation and asked if they could undo the cancellation. They said they could not undo the cancellation and requested I re-purchase the same flight home. I phoned again when I returned to Edmonton and asked if they could refund my prepaid luggage or the cancelled return flight however they held the fine print of there service agreement against me and would not even hand out a coupon to save on another swoop flight.

### "a two-day nightmare"
Abbotsford to Edmonton. A simple 1-hour flight turned into a two-day nightmare with this airline. Delay after delay after delay. When they finally landed us onto the airplane the next day we sat on the tarmac for hours. The pilot comes on the intercom and says "the person who fuels the plane apparently did not show up for work - we have sent someone to try and get him out of bed" when I applied for a refund they wrote me back saying they aren't liable for routine maintenance and I won't be getting a refund. They cost me 10x the ticket price I paid due to missing work and being out of pocket for door and expenses. I had to sleep in the airport and they couldn't care less about the people inconvenienced.

### "We love Swoop"
Cancun to Hamilton. We love Swoop. We have flown with them out of Hamilton approx 5 times in the last 2 years to Edmonton and Cancun. We’ve been delayed on 2 occasions (1-2hrs) but it didn’t bother us since we have reasonable expectations for a small budget airline. All the other times they were exactly on time was like a bonus! I’ve been delayed multiple times with Sunwing(2-6hrs), and delayed on occasion with AC and even WJ. It happens. Also to note we have flown with and without kids, check in counter staff has always been great. I have had no issues with Swoops booking system, online check in or the app. All easy and good. Each and every flight has been very smooth. As a private pilot, I can appreciate when I notice them avoiding the turbulent patches. Every single landing with them has been smooth despite landing (or taking off) in high winds in Mexico, Edmonton, or even freezing rain Last night coming in to Hamilton. And we always are flying in the wild winter season. Yes some of their flight attendants can be young as mentioned in a review here but they are polite, thoughtful and always smiling. I also like how this airline doesn’t allow people to jump around to free open seats without paying and how they don’t offer complimentary menu items. This means they are not in the aisle blocking for an extended time and it really diminishes unnecessary garbage for 200 people that want a little plastic glass of pop just to throw out 5 minutes later. Instead pay $1.99 for a pop can if you really want it and then we are all more responsible - not so wasteful.

### "Never again"
Not Verified |  First and last time flying this airline. My wife and I flew from Hamilton to Tampa on a 5 pm scheduled flight on feb 2. The flight eventually left at 7;30. My beef is the airline was aware the flight would be late early that morning due to the 4 hour late departure of the plane that was servicing the route were on. So all passengers arrived at the airport between 2 and 3 pm for a flight the company knew was leaving at 7! Never again.

### "on time departure?"
Hamilton to Halifax. Just wondering if Swoop has ever had an on time departure? I know they have a fleet of 12 planes of which I’ve just observed 1/4 of fleet leave Hamilton late. Staff at Hamilton airport all young always on their phones not updating status.

### "explained that I had to pay extra"
Not Verified |  I was flying WO761 Vegas to Edmonton and the flight was only half full. I had a very bad back pain and decided to change the seat to try to lie down for a bit. The flight attendant Samantha came to me and explained that I had to pay extra. Despite explanation for the reasons (I am on MRI list) and the fact that the flight was half empty, she insisted for the payment. While I understand the low cost business and completely agree for all additional costs for extra bag, legs' room, drinks, I still think we have to be humans and look into situations with our hearts and minds open.

### "like to thank Swoop employees"
I would like to thank Swoop employees Princess a flight attendant and Nadia (check in counter) who went beyond their duties To ensure that my mother (senior with wheelchair assistance) had a good experience - getting to the gate and on flight WO719, Jan 31/20 from Lauderdale to Hamilton-and assuring me that she got on the plane ( by text). A gate pass which was promised to me was not available at Swoop Ft Lauderdale and their helpfulness is very much appreciated. Thank you

### "always been great"
Orlando to Edmonton. This is my 8th flight with Swoop and I am so pleased they fly out of Edmonton, AB for a reasonable price. The service has always been great. I want to give a huge thank you to the check-in agent at the Orlando airport for doing me a huge favour. I had forgotten to leave my car key fob after returning my rental car and was notified by email of this as my flight was boarding. I mentioned this to the check-in agent in the faint hope of dropping it off somewhere nearby. He calmly told me not to worry he would make sure it got to the rental car return. He basically saved me $220 USD.

### "seamless and enjoyable"
Edmonton to Las Vegas. There was 3 of us travelling together and when we checked in we were not seated by one another. We asked at check in to representative Arvick and he was so pleasant and at the time super busy. He asked us to stand aside to see if he could do something. We stood aside for few minutes and he came back with 3 seats together. We were so grateful. Next we get on the plane and the steward that was in our area was absolutely awesome. Super friendly, helpful and easy going! These 2 made our flight seamless and enjoyable! Thank you so much guys.

### "Awesome flight with Swoop"
Hamilton to Halifax. Was quite nervous about flying with Swoop after reading many terrible reviews but it seems that people only write reviews when things go badly. I would like to commend swoop on a very enjoyable travel experience. Friendly staff at check at Hamilton. Boarding started early and departed right on time. Seats were surprisingly comfy for the price paid and they even had in seat chargers! Cabin crew very friendly and aircraft somewhat clean. If you’re traveling swoop just read about all the extra fees ahead of time and plan and add it to your total cost. But for the extremely cheap base fare I paid I was very happy with the service I got even if everything else was extra, I only paid for what I needed and it all worked out. Don’t be mad about the fees, read ahead of time. Awesome flight with Swoop and I now have hope that Canadians will be able to soon travel all around their country for cheap as this airline expands.

### "certainly wouldn’t recommend it"
We flew out of Abbotsford January 15/20 to Mazatlan. There was a three hour delay which is understandable with the amount of snow that day. That’s not where my issue is, mine is with one particular flight attendant. The only male attendant whose name unfortunately I didn’t get. We chose to pay extra and took first row seating, mine was the aisle seat. Every single time he passed by me he bumped into me with either his hip or the beverage cart, every single time. No ‘excuse me’ or apology, Not once. Even the final time when he swung his arms while going by and knocking everything off of my fold-away tray to the floor, no acknowledgement or apology. And of course no attempt to pick anything up. It’s not as if I was hanging out into the aisle, those trays are positioned directly in front of the seat and do not extend into the aisle. With the cost of extras like seat selection and baggage fees, the price ends up being very close to a much more reputable airline. I doubt I’d use Swoop again and certainly wouldn’t recommend it to anyone after having such a bad taste left. I understand people can have a bad day, but please, if you’re at work in a customer service position, sometimes you have to suck it up and try to be pleasant.

### "I will not fly them again"
Mazatlan to Abbotsford. Do not fly this airline and expect anything resembling customer service. Due to weather we were rerouted to Edmonton. We were supposed to land in Abbotsford at 9:05 pm. Due to the change we arrived at 3:30 in the morning. Abbotsford is in the middle of nowhere as regards transportation. There was no Swoop representative on hand to assist with transportation problems. Lucky for me I found someone who was willing to share a taxi to Vancouver as the first bus wasn't until after 8 a.m. This cost me $90.00 on top of the ebus ticket that I had prepaid and was unable to use. I appreciate that they rerouted us due to landing difficulties. I did not appreciate the lack of information about the change; the use of a standard landing speech as opposed to an informative speech about what to do; the lack of preparedness in Edmonton and the lack of a representative at our final destination. I filed a complaint using their online method January 11th and a week and a half later have received no contact from their service department. If you fly this airline and there are any difficulties you're on your own. I will not fly them again.

### "not flying with Swoop again"
Not Verified | Abbotsford to Winnipeg. I made a mistake while booking a flight and paid for checked luggage for two of us. I immediately messaged Swoop to rectify my error but got no response. I messaged again but two hours later no response. The next day I messaged again but no response. The next day I emailed and messaged with no response and then I called and waited just over an hour to have my call answered. When I told the person about the situation they talked to someone and got back to me saying that it was not possible to refund me. It might have been possible if I had contacted them within 24 hours but now was too late. I tried to speak to a manager but was not given that option. When I said that no one had returned my numerous messages or email the response was that they had been very busy and could not get back to everyone in a timely manner. I asked if eventually I would get a response and was assured that eventually my message would be responded to. When I said that if I had been able to speak to someone right after I had made the mistake it would have been helpful because I could have taken care of rebooking my flights. I assumed that that given the mistake and given that I had messaged to cancel the baggage right after I booked the flight that it would be reasonable to refund the baggage payment. I was told there was nothing that could be done and I should have read the conditions. I am not flying with Swoop again.

### "nobody will show up"
Mazatlan via Abbotsford. Worst Air line in my life. It was incredible to believe that when I was stranded in the airport in Mazatlan nobody will show up to asses us. Just unbelievable.

### "everything went great"
Not Verified |  London to Abbotsford via Windsor. Had a wonderful flight with Swoop airlines. Staff was friendly and there were no delays. Would definitely fly again. Only issue is their website doesn't work well. Other than that everything went great.

### "my experience was amazing"
Not Verified |  London to Orlando. I was nervous to fly with swoop due to negative reviews but my experience was amazing! The weather was bad in London, lots of rain, however we flew out on schedule. Flight back from Orlando was great, we arrived on time. Check in was easy- get the app it’s great! After my flight I ran into a manager with swoop who personally asked how my flight was. I definitely recommend swoop to anyone. Thanks!

### "not worth the experience"
Not Verified | Toronto to Seattle. There were no drinks, no entertainment, the wait lines were long, the flight attendants were cranky. I'm just glad the flight wasn't cancelled like other people have been telling me. Swoop, no matter how cheap, is not worth the experience.

### "Would give them 0 stars"
Hamilton to Abbotsford. Crammed in like sardines. Don't even offer a glass of water and charge for everything. The flight fare might be cheapish. Then cancel flights less than 18 hours out. Contact centre can't be reached despite FAQ showing that is how you fix it. Say they book on earliest? Sunday 4 days later? Despite Fri flight being available. No recourse for any added accommodation costs. Would give them 0 stars.

### "never book vacation with Swoop again"
Not Verified |  We booked a week holiday for San Jose del Cabo and after staying up all night to head to the airport at 3:30 am, upon arriving we found they had cancelled our flight because "there was no pilot". Our options were to find another flight with someone else and Swoop would reimburse that in about 2 months, alternatively the Check-in Agent said they were going to reschedule our vacation for Feb 1st, two weeks later. We thought we would just go in February instead but when we called them a couple days later they said they did not reschedule and were going to issue a refund which we would receive in 2 weeks. Now we don't have our money to book a different vacation (which will definitely be with Sunwing or any other airline). Also they now charge for checked baggage  so you may as well book a vacation with Sunwing as it lands up being about the same price in the end. I will never book a vacation with Swoop again. Maybe only domestic flights but that's about it.

### " mistake while paying for luggage"
Ft Lauderdale to Winnipeg. I made a mistake while paying for luggage. I immediately called Swoop to rectify my error. They refused and I had to pay 60 USD  again. They wouldn’t let me speak to a manager or a supervisor. I ended up paying 120 USD (160cdn). For 1 suitcase. I’m furious about the lack of understanding.

### "Terrible experience"
Not Verified |  Terrible experience. I showed up in Winnipeg for a flight to Hamilton. The flight was to depart at 3:30 pm. I arrived at 2 pm and ready to go. No delays. At 2:10 pm the delays started. No reason was given for the delays except for weather or de-icing. All the other airlines were running on time. At 10 pm I boarded the plane. The plane was speeding up to take off and the pilot slowed down and turned around to go back to the gate. Apparently a warning light came on and there needed to be service. Maintenance arrived at about 11 pm. The problem couldn't be fixed and we were asked to deplane at 12:10 am. At 2:45 am we were told a new plane will be used. We were also told that if we wanted to cancel our flight, we could and we would be refunded if we sent an email to them. I did that and so far no contact has been made. I've also tried calling Swoop directly. I've been on hold for over an hour.

### "I will never fly Swoop again"
Not Verified |  Swoop cancelled our flight And they are attributing it to the rain hamilton is getting. This was after delaying twice before the rain even started, which was made extra questionable when we were told to book with other airlines that were still flying in to Hamilton regardless of weather and at an increased fee (because seats that were $400 a month ago at westjet today were $1200+). In addition, some passengers, including myself, were not sent the notification until we were already in route. I incurred a $80+ cab fare as a result of Swoops inability to effectively communicate or manage their issues as it clearly wasn’t weather. At customer service we were all told we would be put on the next flight (a lie as there were flights for sale on their webpage sooner), that Swoop would reimburse for additional fees incurred by getting last minute flights with other agents etc - essentially anything they could say to be rid of us. I am currently taking my second $80+ cab ride in 5 hrs because of Swoops poor customer service. I will never fly Swoop again if someone at this company doesn’t rectify costs incurred for their errors. Forced to give them one star but this entire scenario was poorly managed and a disgusting display of Swoops lack of customer care.

### "no one provided compensation"
November 2018: Winnipeg to Hamilton return, I made it to Hamilton but the flight back was bumped up 24 hrs. I contacted support via phone and facebook, as well as in the airport. No one could provide me a reason why my flight was leaving a day earlier. I had to book a last minute, very expensive flight on a different airline to get back. No reimbursement was even offered other than a ticket refund. December 2019: Winnipeg to Hamilton return, the first flight into Hamilton was delayed 7 hours until  AM. The new flight didn't meet my travel needs so I called and the representative ensured me they would reimburse my last minute, very expensive flight on a different airline. I emailed Swoop support for this reimbursement 6 times over 3 weeks and have not received a single response. The second flight to Winnipeg was expected to depart at 3:30 PM. I checked into the airport and went through security. The flight was delayed twice until 8:20 PM. At 8:30 PM, they tell us the plane was in Montreal and the flight was cancelled - thanks for the heads up, any reason you couldn't tell us a little sooner given the plane was still in Montreal. The flight was canceled for weather in Montreal and thus not refundable. Interestingly, every other flight for the Toronto area to Winnipeg on real airlines were running just fine, probably because Winnipeg and Hamilton are nowhere near Montreal, where the weather was. I had to book a last minute, very expensive flight on a different airline to get back. Swoop said no one would be provided compensation as it was weather-related. Never ever again will I consider Swoop.

### "friendly and accommodating"
I arrived at Hamilton airport and was past security in Less than 10 mins, parking at Hamilton I must also note is less than half that than Toronto making Swoops choice as Hamilton for their hub even more appealing. The flight was delayed 20 mins departing. This was communicated within the terminal as well as on app and is you signed up for alerts. The plane was new or newly refurbished. The emergency exit was well worth the small upgrade fee as I am 6’3” Food and alcohol was priced no different than westjet or Air Canada. Paying for soft drinks was only real noticeable difference in in flight service. Cabin crew were friendly and accommodating. Flight home was flawless. Departed in time, arrived early. I was in my car within 15 mins of plane landing. Something to note: As Toronto is a much bigger terminal you will clear US customs in Canada before boarding. If your destination is US you will clear them when you arrive at destination if flying out of Hamilton with Swoop.

### "boarded exactly on time"
Las Vegas to Hamilton. Check in at the airport was quick and easy. Aircraft boarded exactly on time and we departed on time. Cabin crew was friendly and we landed earlier than expected despite the very snowy conditions in Hamilton. Paid for an extra legroom seat in row 2 and it was great. A little pricey for 52$. It is a budget airline so everything is an extra charge!

### "you get what you pay for"
Hamilton to Winnipeg. With Swoop, you get what you pay for: Our flight was originally scheduled to leave YHM at 17:40 on 12/21. We didn't get airborne until 00:40(ish) on 12/22. Swoops emails to us indicated that this was due to Flight operation and crew. A couple of Vegas flights were cancelled, one in Florida was cancelled, and no doubt planes were in scare supply and had to pick up the slack. Compensation at the airport consisting of a meal voucher was denied as (per the ticket agent) "none of the vendors in the airport are open. Submit any receipts you have for dinner in Hamilton and we'll consider it for compensation". When we cleared through security the vendors in the departure lounge were in fact open. One would think they could  offer us something from the buy on board cart free? No. No apologies from the crew as to being late. When I filed for my CTA passenger rights compensation claim it took Swoop 3 days to respond indicating they had received it. While it is definitely a cheaper option, save yourself the headache and shell out the extra $$ to fly another airline.

### "very happy with everything"
Hamilton to Las Vegas. After reading so many negative reviews I was scared for my upcoming flight! However I was very happy with everything, Hamilton airport was easy to check in with not many people there and the flight departed on time! All the cabin crew were very friendly and helpful. The aircraft itself was clean and very similar to WestJet aircraft. The standard seats did seem a bit smaller. However, I purchased the extra legroom emergency row for 31$ and it was the best money I ever spent. There was so much room. Highly recommend getting extra legroom seats with this airline for flights longer than 3 hours.

### " I will never fly with them again"
This airline claims to have reasonable pricing but they charge you so much extra that the price gets really higher. I had to pay $4.00 for water.! The staff are arrogant and unkind as if passengers are responsible for their misery. There was a lady with 3 years old who could not make her to move down the isle and her hands were full but all the flight attendant were giving her a dirty look instead of helping her and there was a huge line up behind her so I was in the first row and had to get up to help this poor mother all the way back to her seat! Then try to get back to my own seat. The male flight attendant was grabbing my purse off my lap because I was not allowed to hold my purse or put it under the seat while we are taking off. I thought airlines always put people with little children and special needs first but no not Swoop; they are too good to be considerate and caring about their passengers. I will never fly with them again.

### "not be flying with Swoop again"
Winnipeg to Hamilton. I will not be flying with Swoop again. The flight was originally scheduled for 9:00 pm and was delayed to 4:00 am as a result of poor staff scheduling on the airlines part. Further, the flight was delayed an additional 2 hours to 6:00 am for an overall delay of 9 hours. A flight that was originally meant to arrive in Ontario for Sunday evening didn't arrive till mid-Monday morning. As you can imagine as a busy professional this wrecked havoc on my work schedule causing lost income as well as being a major inconvenience. Save your money and pay the extra $100 to fly with a reputable company. As per the new law that came into effect on December 15th, 2019, I submitted a claim to Swoop for $500.00 over 10 days ago and have yet to hear back from them.

### "delayed a total of 5 hours"
Not Verified |  My first flight from Winnipeg to Las Vegas was delayed by 2 hours almost which made me late for a show in Las Vegas. On the way back the flight got delayed twice with a total of 5 hours. At the end you pay even more due to the delays than flying normal airlines like westjet. Save yourself headaches and do not fly them. They do not even give you water on the plane.

### "would not recommend"
Winnipeg to Hamilton. Would never fly with this airline again. My first flight was delayed twice, initially supposed to depart at 5:30 pm on December 21, but not actually leaving until 12:30 am on December 22. On my return flight, the departure time was also delayed twice from 6:15 pm to 11 pm on December 30th then, after I had waited at the airport for 3+ hours, was canceled entirely. The next flight was not until December 31 at 8:45 pm, which wait for it was also delayed until after 10 pm. No compensation of any kind was offered for all of this, which is wild considering I missed out on 2 days of work and had to pay quite a bit extra in parking because my car was there longer than it should have been. I understand that there are some things outside of Swoops control such as weather, however, I have been flying my whole life and never had such an awful experience. With Westjet, there was significantly worse weather on both ends, and the flight was delayed an hour. While you might be tempted to book with Swoop to save some cash, you're taking a big chance that I would not recommend. The only reason someone should fly with this company is if they really love airports and want to spend the majority of their trip there.

### "flight back was cancelled"
Not Verified |  Our departure 7am Flight on December 26th was 3 hours late leaving. Our flight back December 30th was cancelled by Swoop (via email overnight) less than 24 hours before our flight. (Both Hamilton and Abbotsford weather was clear on the 30th). The next available flight by Swoop was January 3rd. The cancellation forced us to scramble to another airline & cost us the money we were saving by flying via Swoop in the first place. Won't use these guys again.

### "People were very friendly"
Not Verified |  Edmonton to London. Best flight we have ever flown in Canada. Non-stop direct flight, everything felt quick and breezy. Was super affordable which made us skeptical at first but we were very shocked and pleased. People were very friendly and made our trip seem comfortable. Definitely would fly with them again.

### "you pay for everything"
Hamilton to Orlando. Second time flying Swoop. Still the worst airline. Sat on a freezing runway and they didn’t de-ice. Then they asked us to pay $3.00 for a coffee. Almost $600 for a flight to Florida where you pay for everything.

### "an unreliable service"
Winnipeg to Hamilton. I have never had such an unreliable service. My flight out was delayed 9 hrs. Suppose to be at 630pm was at 4am. My return flight was completely canceled and I had to fly home New Years Eve. I don't think I will ever fly Swoop again.

### "Worst flight experience"
Worst flight experience. Our flight from Hamilton to Ft Lauderdale was for 7:15 AM, got flight delay notification at 5:15 AM said the flight changed to 6:10 PM in the evening, after check-in 5 PM in the evening, waited for more than 3 hours and was told the flight was changed again to the 6:10 am in the morning. No email communication regarding transportation and overnight stay or anything. The customer services representatives working for Swoop are rude and terrible. they are careless and has no sympathy. This is the first time with Swoop and will be the last one.

### "they kept delaying the flight"
Not Verified |  Flight 701 from Hamilton to Abbotsford. Had to sit on the plane for an hour to wait for them to fix the wifi. It was ridiculous, waiting an hour to fix the internet that could have went without. And they kept delaying the flight for reasons that made no sense. Excuse after excuse. The communication between pilots and staff is horrendous. I am so disappointed, i will never fly through swoop again. It's like a bunch of children running a business. I would ask to be compensated but seeing how this business is ran I highly doubt they could organize anything. I'm so disappointed.

### "last time we fly with the airline"
Not Verified |  Hamilton to Winnipeg to see my family for Christmas. The day we were leaving we were informed that our flight was delayed due to weather, they delayed our flight by at least 4 hours, the last time we were notified of a delay was due to unscheduled plane maintenance. The first time they informed us was due to weather and the third time was due to the maintenance issue .. so which one was it? On our returning flight we were notified at 5am that our return flight was delayed 4 hours again due to weather, the weather in Hamilton was fine as there was nothing on the radar and our family in Ontario said it was fine there as well. We put off our driving as it is a 5 hour drive to the airport from where my family is. Our flight was delayed twice and our new departure time was at 10:15 PM. As we are driving into the airport parking lot I checked flight status only to find out our flight was canceled, my wife not not receive a notification until we were in the check in line. They said they will not cover a hotel room due to it being because of weather, due to the new laws I suspect that they are just saying this so that they dont have to reimburse you for your trouble, they will give you the option to reschedule or get a refund, if you have somewhere that you have to be last minute flights are not cheap so you are pretty much at their mercy unless you want to spend 1000 dollars to keep your schedule on track. This is not the first time that this has happened to us on swoop but it will the last time that we fly with the airline.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Worst experience ever! I have two young kids. We paid for a flight back to Hamilton from Tampa Bay and the plane couldn’t land because of high winds. So we had to fly to Montreal. We have now been stuck at the airport for over 5 hours since landing and counting, and they emailed us to say they are providing us with two shuttle busses. There are about 300 people that need a bus. Their email stated first come first serve.

### "Avoid like the plague"
Hamilton to Orlando with Swoop. Avoid like the plague. They are unreliable and you will end up with long delays and little to no communication. If I was offered free tickets I wouldn't take them. Had a 7.15am flight that was delayed and the flight was delayed 16 hours. The airline knew that plane had problems well in advance and choose to only let us know an hour before departure. I would wager this airline goes bankrupt very soon with this type of brutal service.

### "a little more and avoid Swoop"
I booked 4 girls and myself a flight to Vegas for my 60th birthday. It was going to be an amazing long weekend. When we arrived at Hamilton airport the outside people were awesome. Grabbed my sister a wheelchair as she was on crutches. Lots of laughs about her going to Vegas on crutches. We got to the counter and asked if we could sit together. The check in attendant was noticeably grumpy. She told us no we could not sit together. I asked if there was a reason. She told us because of the way I booked. I booked all individually over a couple of days as I needed verification from my friends. I said is it possible to ask at the attendant at the check in counter prior to boarding. She said that would cause a problem and I asked why. She said because I’m going to be on the flight. I said ok. Well is the flight full and she said Yes. We board and the flight and there are tons of seats. Matter of fact we ended up sitting together and having entire rows all to ourselves. All five of us. Btw. She was not on our flight. We said nothing so we did not get her in trouble We never asked again about seating. What is the point in lying to us. We were not loud or rowdy. We are 60 ish and expect more from a Canadian airline. Whoever you put out front can make or break our travel plan. We will go back to flying closer to home. Paying a little more and avoid Swoop.

### "flight was delayed by 9 hours"
Winnipeg to Hamilton. Incredibly inconvenient! My flight was delayed by 9 hours! What was supposed to be a 9PM flight slowly but surely turned into a 6AM flight. What made it even more outrageous was the fact that I was traveling within my 5 year-old who was very sleepy for having to get up so early in the morning and because I had a 3 hour drive to bomanville once we landed. It's just annoying to have to contact my family and notify them of the delays, and luckily I got ahold of them before they started driving. The excuse for the delay was a staff rest? Don't schedule the staff if they're going to need that time to rest in the first place.

### "first come first serve"
I was scheduled for a flight to Hamilton From Florida. First off it was suppose to leave at 9pm then delayed to 9:30pm then 10:30pm then 11pm then 11:40 pm. We got no voucher for the inconvenience. When we were departing the captain said “let’s hope we land today” like what? Then as the flight went on it got quite bumpy which is fine but all of a sudden the captain says we are flying into Montreal because Hamilton is too dangerous. I looked at other airlines and they flew into the area 10 minutes later than we were suppose to. Swoop told us they would put us in a hotel for the night and to stay looking at our emails. Hours went by and we got no email about a hotel but we got an email that they have transportation coming and to continue looking at emails. Finally we get an email that they sent 2 buses for our airplane and another airplane which flew in from Halifax and they said it was first come first serve.

### "This is the worst airline"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline. My daughter bought a ticket from Halifax to Hamilton. The plane started to Hamilton flew past Montreal and turned around because they didn’t have enough fuel to get to Hamilton. All passengers were told to get off plane in Montreal. When they disembarked, there was no representative at airport. They were told by pilot to call an 800 number after 8am. The plane landed in Montreal at 2:55am. They were sent an email saying a bus would drive them to Hamilton at 8am on a first come basis. After buses were full they would have to take a train or however they could get back to Hamilton. This airline should not even be in business. They have no right to do this to passengers. My daughter caught another flight with Porter airlines because I told her not to trust Swoop.

### "worst customer service"
London to Abbotsford. The worst customer service experience. This airline is not worth your time or money. Spend a few bucks extra and travel hassle-free I’ll say! The reps working need some training and should use better words.

### "insurance can just change the date"
I bought tickets on Swoop to fly from Edmonton to Orlando in feb 2020. Thought we were going to pay 800$, after thier hidden fees and charges ended up paying 1900$. Just in case I bought swoops insurance. Sure enough my company moved me to Pittsburgh from Edmonton and I cant use the tickets. Call Swoop, sorry no refund, no change of airport. Your insurance can just change the date. And thats 500$. I cant even just cancel myself and the family changes the date to make it easier or cheaper.

### "worst communication"
Not Verified | Hamilton to Halifax. The worst flying experience I have had. Unexplained delays, discourteous staff and the worst communication and service I have seen. Never again.

### "not worth the hassle"
Not Verified |  Hamilton to Winnipeg. No Customer service! First the flight was delayed by four hours. Then our luggage did not arrive. Worst thing, No Swoop personnel at the airport although a Swoop flight left an hour after we arrived. Airport information paged Swoop personnel and no one responded. At 10 p.m. Central time Swoop call centre is closed! Cheap flight not worth the hassle. Would not recommend this airline!

### "Don't be fooled cheap price"
Not Verified |  Hamilton to Winnipeg. There should be warning before buying a ticket for this airline: it may cost you extra money, time and lack of sleep. If and when you fly, a flight attendant may tell you that you are lucky to fly at all. Absolute disaster in terms of service, completely disorganized operation, untrained unpleasant and even challenging staff posted there just to take as much money as they can get from you. Of course that is in a situation, would they provide flight and service. Don't be fooled by an initial cheap or a comparably cheaper price, this airline should be called greed.

### "enduring our eighth delay"
Hamilton to Orlando. I’m writing this from the tarmac where we’re enduring our eighth delay. I prepared to get up at 4 am to get here on time as they ask us to be two hours before international flight. Then the delays start piling up all with different reasons! People with paperwork need to go back to “the office” and will be back in 10 minutes. Now no answer. Just delays. They say we’re leaving in ten minutes and ten minutes later they say 15! Whatever we’re saving by avoiding Pearson (and I do not mind an extra drive to save money) it’s not worth it. The incompetence is next level. I feel like they’ve never done this before.

### "9pm to delayed to 6am"
Winnipeg to Hamilton. Flight was changed from 9pm to 4am then again delayed to 6am. Extra charges are not making it as cheap as they claim. Food vouchers were given but unable to use because nothing open in airport not even a Tim's. The delay is Swoop staffing issues and they should not be offering flights if they cannot fulfill their duties. Not recommending or using Swoop again. Apparently they are notorious for this.

### "worst airline on the planet"
Not Verified | Hamilton to Fort Lauderdale. Trying to get to my family for Christmas. Original departure was set for 9:15 am on December 20th 2019. After being delayed 4 times our new flight time is 11:10 am on December 21st. Swoop has canceled 5 flights within the next 48 hours. I have prepaid for activities, a hotel, and a rental car. The lack of truth and organization from swoop is atrocious. Buyer beware Swoop may be the worst airline on the planet.

### "Would recommend them"
Kelowna to Las Vegas. I was nervous to use this airline because of all the bad reviews. Staff at the airport were extremely friendly and helpful. I had no problems with the check in, the flight or the staff. Would recommend them, especially for the price!

### "This is the worst airline!"
Not Verified |  I was supposed to go to Las Vegas as a Christmas present, the flight got cancelled due to maintenance issues. They have provided a date of December 22-27 which obviously we can’t go because of Christmas. They are refunding however not compensating for the fact we can no longer go on our flight. Also we booked cirque de Soleil tickets that are not refundable. This is the worst airline! They will not go above and beyond which to me is horrible customer service especially cancelling flights after waiting 3+ hours in the airport before cancelling it. I would not recommend this airline to anyone. What an inconvenience

### "definitely fly this airline again"
Hamilton to Orlando. Best flight I have been on! The Attendants were very attentive, respectful, and polite. They even got everyone on the plane to say Happy Birthday to a young boy who turned 8. Our family will definitely fly this airline again.

### "Excellent service"
Tampa to Hamilton. First trip with Swoop. Excellent service from booking until arrival in Hamilton. Flight crew were professional and courteous. Price was amazing. Have already booked a second flight with them.

### "Very rude staff"
Not Verified |  Abbotsford to Edmonton with Swoop. This airline is a joke. Very rude staff. The amount of disrespect was just amazing honestly. How this airline still operates is beyond me. They are not a airline I will ever fly on again.

### "Extremely bad airline"
Not Verified |  Extremely bad airline. My experience was horrible for the outbound trip (Dirty aircraft, cheap service, uncomfortable chairs). They didn’t accept me for check me in 40 mins before my return flight time to Abbotsford BC. They didn’t apologize or give a discount for the next trip. Never will fly again with Swoop nor recommend them to anyone.

### "did not have permanent residence cards"
Not Verified |  Thoroughly useless airline. Did not allow my wife and myself onto plane because we did not have Canadian permanent residence cards. Staff at checkin counter in Las Vegas was not helpful. He lied he contacted and canadian govt official and refused to give us his name. I guess they had other customers on standby and did the usual trick of selling tickets for seats already bought

### "Awful customer service"
Hamilton to Cancun. Awful customer service. Cancelled our flight due to fog after we had arrived in the airport, which is understandable but asked everyone to go to one counter with 2 customer service agents who said they couldnt help us. Eventually a rude supervisor came who refused to talk to anyone unless it was one on one which meant a crowd of people around just her at the desk. I asked for a leaflet with our rights on it. She sent my partner to the other side of the airport to get it, and when I said it wasn't there she said I was rude and wouldn't deal with me. Finally got checked in for a flight from London later that day. Had to rent a car (with my own money) and drive to the other airport for them to ask if i was male or female as the previous service agent had entered my details incorrectly. Then they tried to say it was my fault and they were finding it hard to check me in as i didn't know my sex. Our flight was delayed a further 60 mins leaving with mo info from swoop. Emailed them and still waiting on a response from the airline over 8 weeks later. Will not fly with them again. They make Ryanair look amazing.

### Swoop customer review
Hamilton to Abbotsford. Arrived at the airport at 6am for my 7am flight. Already did a checkin before even arriving to the airport. When arriving, the clerks said they cannot let anyone else into the flight because it is too late. Yet there is a sign saying, "if checked in, 45 min is needed for boarding."? We left and headed straight to Toronto Pearson airport. When we arrived to Pearson, we then get an email that my flight was delayed to 12:15pm. We rushed back taking the 407 only for them to tell me that i cant board because i didn't check in - I then show my boarding pass then the employee just stood there confused on what to do. He then says we can board but our luggage cant. I then request for a manager and she did not act sympathetic at all. Instead she got upset because i am trying to find a way to get my luggage on the same flight. While waiting, we are told the flight has been delayed till 1pm, then again at 1.30pm. Many opportunity to get my luggage into the plane. Finally decided to have my luggage shipped via fedex which cost almost the same as our flight. Never again and definitely no longer referring this horrid company. Spend the extra 100-200 and fly Air Canada. Well worth it.

### "bound to disappoint"
Not Verified |  Abbotsford to Calgary. Don’t consider Swoop an option if you fly for business or personal. Unless Price is absolutely the only option, Swoop is bound to disappoint. Phone lines go unmanned chat lines go on answered on weekends there is no messages to advise you of their Operating times ( which appear to be nonexistent On weekends or evenings as you can be on hold for hours. The chat line is no better. I develop medical problems and couldn’t get a hold of a single person luckily I booked with a credit card such as visa which carries travel insurance etc. otherwise the airline is useless to accommodate you. . This is indifference to whether you get a refund or not which is also a typical policy for a discount airlines.

### "cancelled due to storm"
Hamilton to Las Vegas. My flight from Hamilton is cancelled during boarding due to storm. Rescheduled flight is 5 days from now. Should be next available flight. Gave it another chance taking a bus to London and trying to fly out from there. The runway had no snow and no ice and yet it's delayed from 830 to 930 to 10 now. I'm not hopeful. I won't even fly if it's free next time.

### "cancelled at the last minute"
Hamilton to Las Vegas. The flight was cancelled at the last minute because of the "weather", yet they flew other flights with similar aircraft from the same airport. They promised that it would be refunded, yet when I went to try and refund it and cancel, I simply got an error message. I tried for over 5 hours to get ahold of someone, but no such luck. They tried to re-book me on a flight from the opposite city, on a date 5 days from now. How is it even possible that you would re-book someone flying from Hamilton to Las Vegas, with an itinerary from Las Vegas to Hamilton?

### "overly stressed and upset"
We flew from Abbotsford to Edmonton to see a grandchild before Christmas. We checked in online the night before with 1 bag to check in. Flight to leave at 8:40 am. We arrived to check bag in at about 7:30am. Companion arrived in line prior to me who was parking. Customer service clerks x 2 were helping a customer for about 10 to 15 minutes and who was turned away & left. 2 other people in front of us. 1 clerk left & the other moved & asked if for Winnipeg flights? We spoke up & said no Edmonton. She told us sorry you're to late we are closed for flight. Maybe you can gate check. Surprised we went .. security now throws out toiletries from a bag that should have been on the plane. Ok np. As soon as we got through security a swoop agent was right at security and stopped us saying you can't take that bag very rudely before even getting to the gate. Tried to explain we saw her leaving and no one asked before shutting down if any of us in line were for that flight. She continued to not listen or give any solution other than ... pay full price for another flight, leave the bag (no lockers or holding), can not send bag on the next flight without us, no time to put in car as will not hold flight. After 20min of stress with the swoop agents at the gate how to resolve & make the flight we dropped the bag & tried to fit as much as possible into the 1 bag we had. At this time 1 agent came to us with 2 white garbage bags & said maybe you can fit everything in these. You can fit in over head. Angry this was not an option from start upset me beyond. We left the suit case behind. Upset this was not an explained option in the first place. Worse a young couple & baby went through the same thing behind us & they had a car seat that was gate checked. No reason why the 2 bags couldn't have been gate checked after going through actual security. I was upset but even more for the couple behind. Really the car seats are gate checked. What is wrong with you people? Where is customer service? Even if you can't gate check the bag. Agents were very rude and did not offer reasonable solutions till everyone is overly stressed and upset they may miss the flight all together. On the way back flight delay for 5 hrs. Swoop flights do not accept their own vouchers .. why? 1 star we are still alive & because of 1 flight attendant on one flight.

### "never fly with Swoop again"
Abbotsford to Las Vegas. Did not actually get to fly with Swoop, due to them cancelling our flight to Las Vegas the morning of! We were going down for a 40th birthday and needed to fly that date, so we could be there for the birthday as well as we had other members of our party flying in from another province. Had to book last minute through Allegiant (they were great) and have now been fighting Swoop for them to reimburse me for the return flight. They are saying that we should have taken the Flight home even though it meant flying into Abbotsford, BC and my car being in Bellingham, WA! They didn't care that it meant by car was in a different country from where I landed! All they care about is making a buck and not customer service. I will never fly with Swoop again!

### "absolutely recommend Swoop"
I flew from Hamilton and Edmonton on a Wednesday afternoon, and back to Hamilton on a Sunday morning. After reading others reviews I was nervous that my flight would be delayed or cancelled. Talked to a few people waiting in line and on the plane who said they fly Swoop often and that they have never had issues. Flight to Edmonton had absolutely no issues. Seats are actually a decent size and my plane had chargers at each seat, which was fantastic ( I am used to flying Frontier, which is tiny seats, tiny trays, and no charging ability). Staff were very nice and did a great job. We did have delays on the return to Hamilton, but Swoop sent emails quite a bit in advance ( like 2-3 hours) and explained the issue when we got on the plane. We were supposed to fly out at 9:50AM and we didn't end up leaving until 1PM, so not ideal, but I went into flying with Swoop knowing that could be an issue (based on what I had heard and read from others). But again - staff were very nice, understanding, and made the entire flight enjoyable. I'd absolutely recommend Swoop for a cheap weekend trip. I would likely not recommend it if you need to make a connecting flight and that any delay would mess you up, or if the trip is very time sensitive. My trip was just to visit friends and family and had no set pressing agenda, so Swoop was pretty perfect for that.

### "worst customer service"
Swoop canceled my return ticket back to Edmonton from Puerto Vallarta and did not compensate anything. Even worse they took their time sorting things out so by the time I gave up arguing for them to compensate me, without any warning they closed the flight and now I was not even able to pay for another seat on the same flight that I was already supposed to be on. I had to watch them board the plane I had paid for a seat on and wait 8 hours in the airport for a Westjet flight. They have worst customer service I have ever dealt with. I do not recommend Swoop airlines, pay more for an airline that is organized and has staff that cares and wants to help.

### "a pleasant experience"
Winnipeg to Abbotsford. Our experience with Swoop was very positive. Saved a lot of money and absolutely no problems at all. The flights were on time, cabin staff were great. Check in was fast and a pleasant experience. Will definitely fly with Swoop again.

### "Our whole trip got canceled"
Hamilton to Cancun. We decided to take a try after reading all worst reviews as it’s cheap also but worst decision ever. We went to airport and after some formalities they decided to let us know that flight is cancelled and they were giving us flights which is 10 days after the original flight. I mean seriously who’s gonna pay for our resort reservation and vacation time. Our whole trip got canceled just because of this airline. We paid almost $2000 dollar (Resort in Cancun) which also we didn’t get refund. When I called them I just got my ticket money back, no coupon nothing. Don’t ever book this flight if you want to save your money.

### "We had no issues with anything"
Abbotsford to Mazatlán. We had a fantastic trip on Swoop. Easy check in and the customer service was great especially with the crew on the plane. We had no issues with anything. Just wished that you could buy a sandwich on-board. Will definitely fly with them again.

### "Do not fly with Swoop"
Do not fly with Swoop. Worst experience flying in my life. London to Edmonton flight delayed, delayed again, sat on the tarmac for over three hours, ran out of de-icing fluid, had to actually refuel cause plane sat on the runway so long, put deicing fluid into electrical, the entire plane went black, no air, nothing on. Finally allowed off and sat in boarding lounge until 4:00 a.m. and then told it was cancelled and to be back at the airport for a 730 am flight. The return flight Edmonton to London was equally bad. On tarmac had to return to the gate because a “light was on”. A technician lay on the floor of the cockpit for 90 minutes. Finally, the plane took off but we had to do a landing in Winnipeg to add fuel. It was frightening. Over the twelve-hour ordeal they gave us a glass of water. That’s it. The most disgusting part the head attendant starting washing the bathroom floor in her uniform without even putting on an apron. Evidently the attendants clean the plane including the disgusting bathroom. Honestly, it was just horrific. We lost a full day of our vacation, paid $175 for a hotel in Edmonton we never even got to stay in. And the staff told one lie after another. Wouldn’t just cancel and put us in a hotel. People had to sleep on the filthy airport floor. A single Dad travelling with his baby and toddler was completely ignored. They never even gave him a juice box. Don’t go near the airline.

### "it was absolutely terrible"
Winnipeg to Hamilton. This is the first time I have flown Swoop and it was absolutely terrible. I would not recommend anyone fly this airline. We experienced significant delays (were to leave at 3:50. We boarded the airplane at 8 and didn't take off until 11:30). During this time we had little information as to the delay and it seemed like the crew were making up excuses rather than providing truthful information. First the weather was the reason for the delay, then the delay was apparently because there were many planes ahead of ours for deicing and then there was maintenance issues. At one point the pilot left the gate and drove around the runway then returned. We started getting concerned about our safety and well being. The stewardess told us if we wanted to get off the plane, we could do so in handcuffs. Three people did leave and I think they made the right decision. If you lose confidence in the flight crew shouldn't you be allowed to exit prior to take off? The returning flight from Hamilton to Winnipeg was no better. The crew didn't even know how to properly move the gate to the plane to debark. would not fly with Swoop again. I am not confident they are fully trained, capable or even care about my well being.

### "would fly Swoop again"
Abbotsford to Las Vegas. My family and I recently flew Swoop and wanted to record that we got what we expected and what we paid for; no surprises. Our only comments would be that, as Nexus holders, we were not given the option to use these to expedite security at either airport. We had to use our passports and wait in a very long line upon arrival in Las Vegas and a shorter line back in Abbotsford. Is there any reason or justification for this? We did ask but received no meaningful responses. Seating is a little restricted but we coped and would fly Swoop again, preferably using our Nexus cards.

### "have asked for a full refund"
Hamilton to Las Vegas. I booked my flight with Swoop for the first time. Although I knew they were fairly new and not as reputable as other airlines, I figure I will still give it a try. The morning of my flight, I received an email from Swoop saying that my flight has been delayed from 9:00 AM to 8:00 PM that day due to weather conditions. Fair, no problem. I arrived at the Hamilton airport at about 6:00 PM to catch my 8:00 PM. At 8:00 PM, Swoop decides to make an announcement stating that the flight has now been cancelled. There were no alternatives or solutions offered at all. When I asked why the flight was cancelled, we were again told it was due to weather conditions. When I mentioned that is impossible because I see other flights departing from the exact same airport, their excuse then became "we are short on staff". After hours of trying to get answers from SWOOP, I finally decided to pay an additional $900.00 to leave from Pearson INTL, fly to San Francisco, grab a connecting fight to Orange County (which took 4 hours) and then drive another 4 hours from Orange County to Las Vegas, I was promised by a Swoop attendant at the airport that I would receive a full refund and even that has been stressful. I was refunded $450.00 and I was supposed to be refunded $750.00. I am livid beyond words. I have worked in customer service so I am automatically more understanding in situations like this by nature, but in this case, I am sick to my stomach with this airline. I have asked for a full refund which is what I deserve and getting that is even an issue.

### "flight time kept changing"
Not Verified | Abbotsford to Hamilton. Worst airline ever seen. There was no proper information regarding the flight time and every half hour the flight time kept changing. Customers were treated very poorly. I would never recommend anyone to fly with Swoop.

### "friendly, courteous staff"
Abbotsford to London. This was my 4th flight in the past two months with Swoop. The planes have always departed on time and, so far, have arrived a few minutes early. I've been very fortunate to not have any issues with this airline. Just the opposite - friendly, courteous staff, airlines leaving on time etc.. The airline is no-frills but I could care less. I download a few movies on the iPad and four hours later (and two movies) I'm at my destination. I can handle a few hours without food or drink. I can't say enough about the small airport to small airport convenience. Love it! !

### "staff were friendly/courteous"
Not Verified |  Hamilton to Abbottsford. First time flying Swoop, won't be my last hopefully (would only be due to destination location). There is numerous low cost Carriers offering low fare options throughout North America. Paying for all baggage is not unusual, research prior to booking to assure no extra unknown charges when arriving at the airport. I upgraded to more leg room for a fee, paid for both checked and carry-on and still saved just under $200. The desk Representative and Boarding Staff at the Hamilton airport were friendly/courteous, one of the flight attendants asked me if I would like help to place my carry-on overhead (trust me, this has not happened previously). The plane was spotless and the flight went well. I hope Swoop will keep flying and keep adding new locations.

### "originally 600$ now cost me 1200$"
They emailed me at 8pm EST to tell me my Vegas to Hamilton trip was cancelled due to weather. An hour later I received an email that they had rebooked my Oct 31 trip to Nov 7. Immediately called their call centre which was closed. There was no ticket agent at the airport as this is an online airline. Given that I could not afford another week in Vegas, or the time off from work, my brother and I had to book a one way ticket to Detroit and then car rental back to Hamilton. When I returned home, I checked flight aware and found out the plane had landed in Hamilton Wednesday night, and did not leave. It was scheduled as follows HAM-ABB-HAM-VEG-LON-VEG-HAM. I also checked the swoop app and found that there were seats actually available on flights on Saturday, Monday and Tuesday. Swoop response, there must have been folks who cancelled (same as us, didn't want to wait days to get back). This afternoon flight from Vegas to Hamilton has over 80 seats free, so lots of folks must have paid $$$ to fly back with another airline. Swoop is a ULCC, but I never expected to be rebooked 1 week after they cancelled. This appears to be the norm for this airlines. Spend a few extra bucks, my 2 seat trip on Swoop originally 600$ now cost me 1200$. I could have booked for Spirit for that and gotten hotel rooms at that price.

### "none of us had passports with us"
Not Verified |  Hamilton to Fort Lauderdale. Six of us were denied boarding the plane after clearing customs and security, because none of us had our passports with us. All of us had nexus cards. These cards are of higher security value than passports, are universally accepted worldwide, require a personal interview and security check to obtain. Will never travel with them again after such a disappointing experience.

### "Cancelled flight for weather"
Cancelled flight for "Weather conditions", no phone call or text message. They did send an email a few hours prior to boarding time, but other carriers did not cancel flights. Was able to re book another flight to a nearby airport at my own significant cost last minute- no weather issues aside from rain and a moderate wind. Swoop was not available at airport and has not answered phone calls or email. Waited on hold for a cumulative 2 hours and no help. They auto booked on a flight 1 week later - what help is that? Do not recommend. I understand weather issues happen, but this was not necessary and the fact they are unable to be reached for assistance, compensation, refunds in a timely manner is not acceptable. Beware!

### "just cancelled the flight"
This is the most disgusting airline i have experienced. I had a flight from Edmonton to Hamilton on 30th October 2019. They just cancelled the flight due to so called weather conditions even though the weather was normal. Moreover they didn’t provide accomodations to any of their passengers even told us that we are on our own and booking the tickets for passengers with their own choice. I would suggest everyone to never ever choose this flight.

### "definitely fly Swoop again"
Not Verified |  London to Las Vegas. Swoop did not disappoint and flying Direct is an absolute treat. Not having to drive to Toronto or Detroit saves several hours travel each way. So convenient. Filled my water bottle after customs and brought a couple of snacks - no need to buy anything on the plane. The staff were friendly and professional. Will definitely fly Swoop again.

### "handicap do not fly this airline"
Hamilton to Tampa. If you are handicap do not fly this airline. My husband was required to follow an empty wheelchair to the remote craft on his scooter, then had to take his scooter apart on tarmac. Was then allowed to get in wheelchair to be pushed up ramp. Don’t understand why we couldn’t take scooter apart in terminal to be brought to cargo hold. Our travel scoot, without battery, weighs only 35 pounds less than some luggage. They treated the scooter as if it were a huge problem.

### "late by less than 4 minutes"
Not Verified |  Due to circumstances beyond our control we were late by less than 4 minutes. There was no chance we were going to be checked in. No reasonableness. First and last flight with Swoop. If you miss your first flight, make sure they dont automatically cancel your return flight on you.

### "customer service is terrible"
Hamilton to Mexico. I thought Swoop was a great airline at the time but on reflection, I had to change my flight. I called the number on the first day I tried and spent 2.5 hours on the phone and nobody answered. The second day after 2 hours someone picked it up, Flight changed $200.00 cell phone bill. Upon arriving at home flight delayed 1 hour I proceeded to get my luggage but it was lost, never left Mexico, after paying $105.00 in overweight fees. The Swoop rep was very nice at the airport and all forms were filled in. My luggage arrived two days later. Meanwhile, I called Swoop and for the trouble, they gave me a $50. coupon, not telling me it expired in 90 days. Went to book my flight when the new flights came out south and the coupon was no good. How can a coupon expire in such a short time? You would think that they would bend over backwards for a new airline trying to get business but by there reviews, they will not be around for long. I liked flying with them but the customer service is terrible.

### "cancellation 4 hours prior to departure"
Abbotsford to Edmonton. I am very disappointed to only receive a cancellation notice email 4 hours prior to departure. No phone call, no text message notice. I was lucky to check my email by chance and found out this change. Otherwise it will be a big surprise to know the cancellation after driving one hour to the airport. You can imagine the people get crazy there now... who have booked their hotels, rental cars, meeting and events. I checked weather of both cities of departure & arrival. Rainy day in Abbotsford 9c, cloudy in Edmonton. I don’t understand why the flight got cancelled. Cheap flight has reason be to cheap. I won’t use this airline for business trip anymore.

### "I'm not impressed at all"
Edmonton to Winnipeg. We had a death in the family a few days before the flight later this week. They weren't willing to do anything for me. We wanted to change the flight, but for a $500+ fee, more than we paid for the tickets. They wouldn't cancel, or let us give the tickets to someone who would use them. I'm not impressed at all.

### "landed at a different City"
Las Vegas to Hamilton, diverted to Toronto. This is the worst airline. On 20 October they landed at a different City because they said they couldn’t land at Hamilton due to fog. They have offered to give passengers $100 back if they have a receipt. You can’t even get back to the airport where we were supposed to land for $100. An absolute joke. To top it off, the flight status on their website indicates they dropped us off on time at the correct airport.

### "difficult to cancel flights"
Edmonton to London. Terrible airline. Very difficult to cancel flights. Impossible to reschedule with them. Their policy for rescheduling a flight is ridiculous. They pretty much stole $700 from us.

### "charged me $50 for it"
The flight was delayed for hours for no reason without any notice. I flew with one backpack from Abbotsford to Edmonton and there was no problem with it and I didn’t have to pay for it. But when i was going back to Abbotsford with same backpack after two days, they didn’t allow me to take my backpack and charged me $50 for it. Staff was very rude. Swoop need to fix their policies.

### "the price can’t be beat
Hamilton to Halifax. Amazing experience. I was very worried after reading the reviews but it was amazing the flight was on time both ways. The Hamilton airport was worse for loading onto the plane because you have to walk out to the plane so it took longer but the flight back from Halifax the loading was quick. The airplane was clean and the crew was nice. Would fly again totally amazing and the price can’t be beat. Would fly again

### "Return flight was cancelled"
Winnipeg to Vancouver. Return flight was cancelled, re-booked us 11 days later. Had to pay $3200 to get home on an alternate carrier. Offered my family $1039 or compensation. Brutal airline! The cost savings aren’t worth the risk of cancelled flights. Stay away!

### "80 dollars for the same bag"
Edmonton to London. Don't say a word about baggage size or fees at one airport whereas charge a ridiculous 80 dollars at a different airport for the exact same bag. Bag fits underneath the assigned space beneath the adjacent seat and can definitely fit in the overhead storage but they see that it's okay to charge 80 bucks just because that bag doesnt exactly fit into the cage even though it does.

### "price is super cheap"
Hamilton to Edmonton. First time flying with Swoop and I can say that for the price this was an excellent experience! Most people don't check the finer details and complain about everything costing extra and expecting a luxury experience. As long as you know what you are getting then it's fine. Leg room and seats were perfectly fine. Food was lacking but when you are paying literally less than half the price of other airlines you cant complain! I would definitely recommend this airline and I would fly again with them when the price is super cheap! People these days will complain about everything and expect luxury for nothing! Make sure you read all the information before you fly and you will have a pleasant journey as I did!

### "very satisfied"
Hamilton to Las Vegas. I encourage people to use this airline from Hamilton to avoid the madness of the Toronto airport. No big line-ups, no numerous computers, etc. I hope Swoop stays. It is a no-frills airline but who cares. It is the destination, not the journey. They have overnight flights which are great because you end up sleeping through most of the journey. They can offer a low-cost price because there are no meals and you have to buy your drinks but who cares! You can bring your own snacks on board. The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful and the plane was clean. I have flown to Las Vegas a few times on Swoop and was very satisfied.

### "attendant was very cold, no smile, not pleasant"
When I was booking my flight I wasn’t planning to take luggage but later decided to do so. I proceeded to manage my booking and pay for the bags I was checking in and the system started acting up. I tried several times to put through the payment but it didn’t go through until after 4 tries. After I checked my itinerary I realized that the checked bags were added to my returning flight and not my departure flight so I tried to adjust it but couldn’t. I tried searching for a way to connect with Swoop but couldn’t get through to anyone and so I waited until I got to the airport to let them know that I was having a problem and needed my checked bags to be added to my departure flight instead of my returning flight. The attendant proceeded to tell me that she can’t do that and there is no return policy so I have to pay for the bags again. I told her I am not asking for a refund, I am asking if the bags can be switched to my departure. She said no. I asked if I can speak with someone she said she was the supervisor and it is their policy. I get that, but is there a way to adjust this so I don’t have to repay for this simple mistake. She called someone and I’m at the end of it when I was told I would still need to pay again the same price I paid online ($110). My plan was to take checked bags with items to help some people who were displaced because of hurricane Dorian in Bahamas so my intention was just to drop off the items and not to return with any checked bags and so I don’t think it was necessary for me to pay again for the bags when it clearly a mistake. It was my first time flying with Swoop and it was the worst. The attendant was very cold, no smile, not pleasant, didn’t care and at the end of it all, I had to pay again. Don’t think I will fly with them again.

### "denied boarding for my flight"
Abbotsford to Hamilton. Yesterday evening, after nine hours of travel (air and land) from Queen Charlotte BC in Haida Gwaii to Abbotsford I was denied boarding for my flight to Hamilton. The reason for denial was having incorrect identification according to company policy, but I feel that the issue was addressed with little respect and understanding of the situation and the lack of willingness to cooperatively address the issue will result in me missing my brother's wedding tomorrow. Earlier this week I lost my wallet with my passport in it, leaving me with no photo identification, living on a small island with no access to apply for an emergency passport or other government identification. From a Service BC satellite office, I acquired an interim driver's license and interim BC Services Card (Care Card). Prior to my travel, I checked the Transport Canada regulations and found that for domestic travel 2 pieces of valid (not-expired) government issued identification were acceptable so long as they had the name that matched the ticket, birth date and gender. It also mentioned in the case of a driver's license having the expired license as accompanying photo ID. I had all these pieces, although my expired driver's license was for an Ontario license rather than my interim BC license (which is just the reality of me moving from Ontario to BC within the past few years). I figured I had all the necessary documents to travel. I did a quick scan of Air Canada and Swoop policies and noted they mirrored Transport Canada policies. I was able to board my Air Canada flight from Sandspit to Vancouver with the documentation I had on hand. I then traveled 2 hours from YVR to YXX on public transit and was denied boarding for my 9:55pm flight. The reasons provided to me were as follows: - Because my expired license is from a different issuing agency than my interim license, it was not considered valid as a primary or secondary piece of ID - Swoop accepts "Care Cards", but the customer service representative said that "BC Services Cards" are not the same. BC only issues Service Cards now, so the paperwork I had was as close to a Care Card as I was going to get. The other ID I had on hand included a fishing license (accepted until very recently), several student cards (which I recognize are not government issued), photocopy of my passport, and an expired government-issued residency card. I was told that there was no grace period for accepting the fishing license, although the Transport Canada policy change is still in its grace period. When I was denied I respectfully accepted that I did not have what was required, but asked if I could switch to the flight the next day... I would have my friends send down my birth certificate and any other documentation today (Oct 4) to board the 9:55pm flight. I also asked if he could help me identify what ID I would need if I rebooked the flight. The agent said he did not have time to help with re-booking and told me to call Swoop (the offices were closed at that time). I asked if his team lead could help me, he went to ask her, but came back saying she was too busy to talk to me. This morning I called the Swoop office. The woman I spoke to was very sympathetic and said if I was able to get proper ID she could book me on this evening's flight and offered to ask her supervisor if they could give me a voucher towards the price of the flight (which had gone up to over $450 one way).

### "bag was broken upon arrival"
Abbotsford to Hamilton. My bag was broken upon arrival to YHM, september 17th 2019. I informed a staff member of Swoop, she then took pictures of my bag and the baggage tag and said she would email me later for a damaged bag claim, that she was too busy to file it right then and there. One week had gone by and I heard nothing Sept. 24th 2019 I was traveling back to YXX told the check in agent that my bag was broken upon arrival and that I wanted to fill out paperwork, she advised me to contact the head office, it is now Oct. 2nd I have done all the running around and jumping through hoops for them, sending them pictures of the damage to my bag etc. Called the head office and having to return the next day to YXX an hour from my home a two hour road trip that could have been avoided if someone would have just done their job in the first place. This company gives you the run around hoping you will just get tired of the chase, and let them be.

### "Not worth it"
Edmonton to Hamilton. 4 years that I have not seen my parents and I decided to book a flight to Hamilton to show them the Niagara Falls, and what did Swoop do, they lost/misplaced my luggage. I have to deal with their ignorant and arrogant representative. My entire trip was basically ruined thanks to them! A manager stepped over and said he will give me 2 options, 1: my luggage will be in Edmonton and they will only reimburse me 300$ for the clothes I have to purchase for myself. 2: Since it’s a weekend they don't have a courier, and they will pay much more to send it to my hotel. So I have to pick up my luggage at Hamilton from Niagara and back and forth out of my own money. I fought hard and ended up with an agreement that they will reimburse me one way of my fare. I have to deal with them for the entire day! Not worth it! instead of me enjoying my time with my parents I wasted it dealing with swoop!

### "worst customer service"
Winnipeg to Edmonton. I had to reschedule a flight due to a death in the family. This was over the July 4th weekend. I couldn't get through on the phone as they had cancelled so many flights from July 1-4 that their phones were jammed. I booked another airline to get to Winnipeg. I thought from Winnipeg to Edmonton I would use some credit from the unused flight. It took 3 times at 45 minutes on hold each time before I got through to someone. Although I had prepaid the seat and baggage that was non-refundable - absurd since neither was use. There was a $100 cancellation fee - I couldn't use the insurance I purchased because I couldn't get through on the phone to re-book my original flight. They agree to refund me $59. A month later I still didn't have it so I went on their online chat. 6 hours I was on chat as the "person" would leave for an hour at a time. They said there was a credit to my Swoop account for 90 days - really? They never said that before. After understanding the full story, not being able to re-book due to their shortcomings not mine, providing them with my re-booked flight info, etc they then agreed to refund $76.70 to the original method of payment. This conversation occurred Aug 15th. To date no refund. I went back on chat and was asked all the same stuff - I think they are trained to wear a person down. After providing everything again and sitting in the chat module for an hour I received "We are experiencing high email volumes and working hard to answer in the order received. We appreciate your patience. I ask how if I am talking on chat I am not already first in line. They say "I am speaking to you on social media. The emails are in the email folder being responded to by other agents. Separate process for both these operations. I am chatting with someone who can do nothing? What is the point of it all? Does the chat turn into an email? Again, I am sure this is intentional on the part of Swoop to have people walk away from it all. Worst experience, worst airline, worst customer service.

### "hope Swoop is here to stay"
Hamilton to Las Vegas. This was the best experience flying to Las Vegas thus far. My daughter lives there, so I try to go a couple of times a year. Previously, I had no other choice, but to fly out of Toronto. As I live in Hamilton, this added another hour to my travel time. Having a direct flight to Las Vegas out of Hamilton was amazing. It took only 8 minutes from my house to the airport. Checking in was a breeze and much less crowded than Toronto airport. The flight crew on my flight were engaging and helpful. I really hope Swoop is here to stay because I will definitely be flying with them on a go-forward basis.

### "could not land due to heavy fog"
Not Verified |  We have flown with Swoop several times with no problem. This flight to Hamilton was the scariest ever. There was an attempt to land in Hamilton but aborted. Flight attendant advised we could not land due to heavy fog (we could all see the city of Hamilton and lights at the airport). Flight attendant then said we were going to land in London. We were in flight assuming we were headed to London. Later, the pilot or co-pilot came on apologizing for not speaking with us sooner but they had been very busy trying to figure out where we were going to land. He then said we were going to attempt to land in Hamilton again. Again, landing gear came down and we went down to land but headed back up. After the second attempt you could see and hear that all the passengers were nervous and quite quiet. We were in flight again. There were no more contacts from the pilot/co-pilot, nor a flight attendant. We then did land in Hamilton - a very rough landing. We were to originally land just after 11 p.m. and ultimately landed well past midnight. Would like to know what happened as it definitely was not anything to do with fog as upon disembarking from the plane people were chatting about 'where is the fog'. I know ourselves,, we drove home and did not encounter any rain, fog or anything else. Hope that Swoop will advise what happened as I will probably choose not to fly with this airline in the future.

### "have not had an issue yet"
Not Verified |  Abbotsford to Edmonton. I have flown with Swoop 3 times a month for the past year and a half and have not had an issue yet with them, maybe the odd delayed flight for an hour but other then that they are great and I will continue flying with them.

### "happy with the service"
Hamilton to Las Vegas. 3rd trip to Las Vegas with Swoop. Very happy with the service, the people and the flights. On time every time. I look forward to my next trip with this airline.

### "great for lower price flights"
First and foremost Swoop has the worst customer service help available. It takes them 5 hours to a few days to reach back. They do not come up with solutions, their reps are extremely robotic on the phone and they strictly stick to their policies. So avoid making any mistakes or changes, or you will run into this issue, and it's the biggest pain. On a lighter note, Swoop is great for lower price flights. You pay for your base cost flight, then you pay for your seats, baggage, and any thing extra. So you get to control what you want and how much you want to ideally pay for for a flight altogether. The plane itself is comparable to Westjet's comfort, especially the Emergency Exit seats. Those are my go-to seats, I'm not sure about the front row but so far the Emergency Exit Seats are my favourite. I highly recommend for trips that are longer than 2 hours, or if you happen to be on the heavier side, no shame. Swoop does not have free wifi or inflight entertainment, so make sure you have your own music/videos/movies downloaded beforehand. Food & beverages are overpriced like any flight, bring your own because snacks are life. If you're looking for cheap and basic flights, Swoop will cover that but don't expect them to go above and beyond when there is a hiccup in your plans, you will end up in an anxiety attack and stressed out, because customer service is definitely not their strongest trait.

### Swoop customer review
Abbotsford to Edmonton. The incidence happened on 10 September at Abbotsford I was sitting on the right side of the plane where engine started backfiring and with bumps no one wished for that kind of experience. The lady captain did show her skill and landed the plane in professional manner. What disturbed me  was the miscommunication part at airport no one was clear at the information desk,  representatives at different kiosks were telling their own stories and no one was assured what they are talking will be going to be true. At morning after the incidence we waited up to 2 hours and it's been told to us come back at 5.30 p.m to catch your next flight at 8.00 p.m. I was flying with my wife and 2 daughters. We went back to my relatives home till we start from home to airport I was regularly receiving e-mail from swoop your next flight is on time so when I reached at airport I did my checked in at 5.30 pm and returned my rented car and went to cafe shop for some refreshment and to add more confusion after 15 minutes they announced this flight is cancelled and there is no update on flight whether it will be rescheduled or not - at front desk the ladies on duty told they don't have any information on that and if we want any update we have to wait else we can cancel the flight for no reimbursement. After 2 hrs they told us that flight is rescheduled for 12.15pm but none was sure on that too. So now I have to wait for those extra hours. No food or snacks was offered. Lastly the flight came and captain  flew that plane like a very relaxed music on piano we were offered free snacks on board where you don't need or want after so much hassle or being tired. I want to rate 10/10 to both pilots and 2 to ground staff and head office.

### "comfortable flight. Very pleased"
Winnipeg to Kelowna. Incredibly friendly staff, flight was on time, will most definitely use Swoop again. Arrived 10 minutes early, comfortable flight. Very pleased.

### "website wouldn't let me check in"
Halifax to Hamilton. Swoop ripped me off for $399 When trying to check in online, their website wouldn't let me check in, even though I tried a dozen times ranging from an hour and twenty minutes to an hour and eight minutes before the flight (their cutoff is one hour), so I took screen shots and called service. They were very rude and said there was nothing they could do, and that I had to book again for $399. It was their fault that I couldn't check in.

### "will think twice before booking Swoop again"
Las Vegas to Edmonton. I booked a Swoop flight from Edmonton to Las Vegas last weekend, they delayed our departure by over 1.5 hours with no apologies. Of course, the passengers had to entertain themselves with airport spirits and the flight was quite loud. I don’t complain it’s an affordable flight. I am traveling light with a 1/2 size carry on. No charges to leave Edmonton. I tried to check in online on my way back and it was not allowed. So I showed up 2 hours early at the gate just to find out the the same half size carry on was not allowed and needed to pay $57.75 US dollars to also carry on myself. Usually if you pay cargo at least they take it off you no this time. Pretty much a money grab. I will file a formal complaint and will try to recover those fees. However I want to put a warning to frequent travelers like myself that trust the system and the common sense of the crew. I will think twice before booking Swoop again.

### "no apologies, no contact"
September 6, 2019 - I travelled from Abbotsford August 30, 2019 to Edmonton, I was attending an early morning wedding in Edmonton August 31, 2019. When we booked my flight I did not book any baggage, 4 days before departure I went online to book a check-in bag, the cost was $42 for carry on or check-in. I paid $84 for the return flight. However, when I checked the itinerary I noticed I indicated a carry-on bag...not sure if it was my error or a computer error, could have been either. However I immediately emailed and tried the online chat to resolve the issue, no response to this day and the online chat did not respond until 24 hours later, I sat waiting on the phone for 3 hours refreshing the message and receiving a message indicated 'you have been added to the queue' several times and then twice 'your request has been sent to Social Care team and from now on chatbox has been disconnected'. On August 30 went to Abbotsford airport explained the situation showed email and chatbox messages, then spoke to a supervisor who refused to give a last name, I still was charged an extra $21. To top it off on my 1-hour flight from Abbotsford to Edmonton my suitcase was misplaced!! I explained I had a wedding in the morning, I was assured that my suitcase would be on the next flight that evening, so I didn't go and buy new clothes. the suitcase did not arrive that evening, I couldn't sleep the thought of attending a wedding in my travel pants and a golf shirt left me feeling humiliating and anxious. I bought toiletries and shaving supplies the next morning, the suitcase was delivered to the hotel after I left for the wedding. I have still not heard anything back from Swoop, no apologies, no contact, nothing!

### "we have to pay for the bag"
Hamilton to Edmonton. I was travelling with my partner for the first time with Swoop and had the worst ever experience. While we were getting our boarding pass from Hamilton airport, the lady at the ticket counter stated that we have to pay for the bag since to her it appeared big in size. I told her that the bag is flexible and will fit in easily to which she replied that she would charge me double at the door of aircraft if I didnt pay her now. I had no option left and I paid. In the aircraft my bag fit properly under the seat and the crew from forward confirmed that it wasn't oversize bag and I should not have been charged. On her recommendation I got the courage to take the picture and post a review. The crew inflight was amazing but they definitely need to have a good on ground crew with some customer service skills. I am really upset and would definitely want to get the refund for the same. I hate to travel with swoop again.

### "insurance they offer is absolutely useless"
Not Verified |  The insurance they offer so you can make changes to your flight is absolutely useless. If you are Buying last minute tickets make 100% sure your details are correct or you lose your every dollar for the ticket. Absolutely no refund or credit of any type. Worst airline ever - buying direct from westjet or air Canada is the way to go. You don't save anything with this airline.

### "bumped flight time back about 12 hours"
Edmonton to Abbotsford. I am currently sitting in Edmonton airport with my wife. We were supposed to be at our destination by now. They bumped our flight time back about 12 hours. That was the first time. The 2nd time it wasn't even announced, I had to find out by noticing the plane hadn't arrived yet and asking an attendant. When I asked who I speak to about this to complain about the multiple delays (we both work 8am), he pulled out a stack of complaint cards. Clearly this airline knows their customers will be complaining if their staff carry around 50-60 cheaply printed photocopies of complaint contact cards. Was hoping for a great way to travel our price-gouged country. This is not the airline for Canada. Do not fly with Swoop. They are pathetic and are clearly trying to force you to book on Parent-company WestJet for last-minute prices.

### "cancelled with zero notice"
Winnipeg to Abbotsford. Our flight was cancelled with almost zero notice! The first few times, we were informed that the flight was delayed, then they finally said it was cancelled! They rebooked our flight 2 weeks after the cancelled the flight. Don’t they know some people have jobs to get back to? An airport staff informed us that Swoop has a flight leaving the next night after the original date, so we went to the airport to have them book us to that flight face to face. They said it was fully booked. They have another flight leaving a day after, they said it’s booked as well. My daughter checked online. It turned out they were lying. So after hours of dealing with them, they finally booked us to that flight! We lost 2 days of work! And we’re not even done with the bad experience yet! It was a connecting flight from Winnipeg to Edmonton and Edmonton to Abbotsford. Well, the flight to Edmonton was once again delayed! So we ended up missing the flight to Abbotsford! There’s another flight to Abbotsford that night and they wouldn’t let us book that without paying! Even though it’s their fault we missed the connecting flight! We paid another $600 on top of the original $700 fare! Lost days of work and we were so tired!

### "our experience was really good"
Not Verified |  Edmonton to London. Tickets were cheap, baggage fees were reasonable (for checked bags, didn't have carry-on), ground staff were friendly and competent, cabin staff were good as well, checked bags didn't get lost, flights were on time, seats were fine. Other passengers were my biggest gripe, some pretty rude people, but obviously this isn't the airlines fault. I know Swoop has had some issues with canceled flights, but our experience was really good, easily on par with other airlines and for a much lower price. Sure, you don't get free carry-on, free snacks, free drinks, but for the savings on ticket price, I'll take it.

### "1 star is too much"
Not Verified | Edmonton to Las Vegas. Garbage, under no circumstances book with this airline. Cheap and crooked. Extra charges you to death, then will strand you with a "cancelled or reschedule" flight. Stealing your money and make you have to last-minute book with another airline which is super expensive. They stranded 6 of us in Las Vegas within hours of our flight home saying it was rescheduled 5 days later. Had to rent a car and drive 2700km home. 1 star is too much.

### "sad and disappointed"
Not Verified |  Edmonton to Hamilton. Cancelled flight less than 24hrs notice with no alternative option and no answer from customer service email or call wise. Recommend going to an alternative airline and avoiding all the hassle and customer service. Extremely sad and disappointed and that to spend way more money trying to book a last-minute flight with another airline.

### "it’s simple and works"
Not Verified |  Edmonton to Abbotsford. Love this! I am so happy that Canada finally has ultra low cost carrier. I fly them all the time abroad in Europe. It’s a new product in Canada and a lot of travellers here are not yet aware of how they work. I see reviews that are poor because they don’t offer or provide complimentary items, but that’s how the ultra low cost works. You buy what you want and need for your flights, it’s simple and works. Looking forward to using Swoop again.

### "no assistance at all"
Hamilton to Las Vegas. I got an email on August 15th at 4:00 AM in the morning informing me that my Swoop flight initially planned the same day at 7:30 PM was changed to August 22nd. Their customer service was closed until 10 AM eastern time and I had no information at all other than a notice saying "If the re-accommodation option provided does not work for you, you are able to book with an alternate carrier and submit your receipts for reimbursement provided it is base economy fare. Pay attention with the flight you book if this happens to you as they will reimburse only an "Eco Basic" ticket so if you buy a new economy ticket which is not specified as "Eco Basic" they won't reimburse your ticket. They got me with that, I bought the cheapest ticket with Westjet but it was not an Eco Basic (there are apparently 5 different Eco prices that Swoop won't tell you about in their email) so when I finally got a customer service representative, after one hour wait, they simply told me that they won't reimburse my new ticket. I called Westjet back completely panicked and the wonderful lady on the phone helped me to change my ticket to an Eco Basic and reimbursed directly the $1000 I just spent in the other economy ticket. As my new flight was departing from Toronto I had to pay for parking at the Toronto Airport + rent a car from Hamilton to Toronto to get my car back. I submitted all my expenses but got no answer yet. My only advice is to avoid this airline, if everything goes good it's great you had a cheap flight but if it goes wrong you have no assistance at all and no reimbursement for me so far.

### "trying to get a refund"
Flight cancelled with just over 24 hours notice and rescheduled so that instead of 6 days in Orlando I would get one, with the other two days being travel days. Spent 3 hours making new flight arrangements out of a different city with a different airline and 1 hour on hold with Swoop before giving up on trying to get a refund, another hour negotiating a website to formally cancel my flight with Swoop, don't know if I got the refund. Thanks for getting my holiday off to a terrible start Swoop!

### "extremely cheap, nasty"
Not Verified |  When my teenage daughter arrived at YEG in Edmonton she had already checked in online and required only her checked bag to be tagged. It was discovered that she had incorrectly clicked and paid for an in cabin flight checked bag and not a checked bag. As SWOOP airlines baggage wording is confusing she gently explained that she had clicked on the wrong box and then also requested that she would like her bag to be placed underneath the plane. With a satisfying smirk on her face the agent said that she could not make that change and then told my teenage daughter a credit card is required for payment. My daughter asked if there was anyone she could talk to about this besides agent She then was told that we have no customer service on Sundays. English comprehension and synthesis clearly appeared to be a barrier for the agent but when my daughter reiterated that there was no available customer service again the answer was no! My daughter paid the extra $50 for her bag utilizing my credit card as I don't know to many young teenagers with a credit card. When arriving on the plane she found it filthy and when wiping the seat, seat belt, head rest and table tray down with a lysol wipe the remains were a yellowy brown colour. This is an extremely cheap, nasty and non customer directed airline. Please pay an extra $50 and fly with someone else.

### "refused to take his luggage"
My grandson (15 yrs old) is flying tonight (Aug 19, 2019) from Halifax, to Hamilton (WO115) and then on to Edmonton.(WO103). At the desk in Halifax I asked to have his luggage checked all the way to Edmonton, but was told it couldn't be done - he would have to retrieve his luggage in Hamilton and check-in again. The Halifax to Hamilton leg was an hour late departing and when he got in Hamilton, the person at the Swoop desk refused to take his luggage, because he had missed the window by 15 minutes. The cause for him missing the timeline was the "delayed Swoop flight" from Halifax. When he tried to explain that to the person at the desk, her reply was "thats not my problem, you have to deal with it", and she walked away. She said this to a 15 year old boy travelling on his own! To say that I find this absolutely incredible would be an understatement. Now I have to arrange to have the bag picked up at the airport and shipped to Edmonton. They will never have the opportunity to do this to me or my family again - a cheap price does not allow you to dispense with common courtesy and common sense.

### "the plane was delayed both ways"
Edmonton to Las Vegas. On my round trip to Vegas this weekend the plane was delayed both ways, unknown reason as there were no inbound passengers that disembarked the plane either time once it finally parked at the gate to pick us up. This was my first and last with Swoop.

### "It just very disappointing"
Abbotsford to Edmonton. We only have an hour and half flight with Swoop Airlines and have a car seat with together with our luggage. Waited for our car seat by the claim area and unfortunately it was nowhere to be found. The staff whom I didnt get the name approached us and asked if we are waiting for our oversized baggage and I was like yes its a car seat. She said they cant find it and we need to fill up a form and they will replace the car seat. She didn’t apologized to us in behalf of the company. She even want me to open the car seat from the box but I didn’t. which irritates me because we didn’t even get great customer service from her. It just very disappointing. But then we appreciate that they replaced the car seat.

### "the flight was cancelled"
Not Verified |  I was supposed to fly Swoop from Hamilton to Vegas today. The flight was cancelled and they only emailed us one hour before our flight. We were to go to Vegas 8/15 and return 8/20. We were at the airport, limo had dropped us off and we get a message on our email that the flight was cancelled and that it would not depart for Vegas until 8/20 - we were to be home and back to work on 8/20. We had all of our hotels booked and so we had to call an uber to the airport, find our way to Hamilton, rent another vehicle and drive to DETROIT as that was the closest airport and the only way we could still get to vegas that night... not only did this cost us 1000$ each per person, it wasted so much time. We are starting off on our vacation- ruined and I am shocked that Swoop can get away with rebooking everyone on a flight 5 days later! in what world does that work for anyone. I feel bad for everyone who works for Swoop as I do not want to imagine the flack they are getting right now. I hope Swoop gets shut down until they can figure out how to operate as a feasible airline. Wrecking peoples travel plans that many people only get a few times a year is completely unfair.

### "delayed and cancelled flights"
Not Verified |  Edmonton to Abottsford. I'm sitting here in the Edmonton airport as I write this waiting for my flight which has been delayed 3 hours. I guess you get what you pay for but I would not recommend you use this airline if you value being on time to your destination. 3 times flying with them and 3 times delayed. Big problem with delayed and cancelled flights with swoop!

### "this airline made money of me"
Halifax to London. I came in on July 30 and paid for two checked bags both ways. One for myself and one for my wife. My wife could not come and they would give a refund which l understand. I wanted to to bring a walker home to give as a gift to a young child to help him walk. I asked if l could check it as my Wife bag. I was told no and had to pay 80 just to check in the walker. Asked to talk to Manager for Halifax (YHZ) still said no. The lack of compassion by this airline is disappointing. If l just would have book both of the checked bags in my l may not have paid more. So this airline made money of me. They booked someone else in my wife place. Plus charged me again for a checked item that l already paid for.

### "nothing negative to say at all"
Winnipeg to Kelowna. First time travelling with Swoop, and won’t be the last. I chose Swoop because they are the only airline to offer direct flights from Winnipeg to Kelowna, which was a major plus because I was travelling with my 3 month old baby. No issues with baggage - as long as you follow their guidelines you shouldn’t have issues. Even with adding seat choices, baby equipment, and bag fees, the flight was still cheaper than other alternatives. Flights were on time and pleasant. Nothing negative to say at all.

### "do nothing for customers"
Never fly Swoop. 1 hr 33 mins on average for customer service, they damaged my bags and gave a 50 dollar voucher which expires in 90 days. They cancel and change flights for no reason, never answer their phones and do nothing for customers. I ended up fixing my own baggage and fixing my own stuff.

### "return flight was cancelled"
Kelowna to Las Vegas. We to Las Vegas on Thursday, On Saturday I was contacted via email that our return flight home (on Sunday) from Vegas was cancelled. They rebooked us on another flight next Thursday. We were forced to buy a one way flight home on Westjet for $1360. The contact center phone number is only available Mon - Sat during business hours and there's a fee of $15.

### "friendly and hassle free"
We were very excited about being able to fly directly from London to Halifax. Price point was excellent. Service was friendly and hassle free. Hoping to fly again next summer.

### "definitely fly with them again"
Flew round trip from Hamilton to Abbotsford, 2 flights 2 weeks apart. Had extra leg room seats at front of plane. Aside from complaints about cancellations and delays, most of the complaints about this airline are because people didn’t read before booking or flying. Yes the check-in counter closes exactly 45 mins before your flight. If you arrive 44 mins before you’re out of luck. Yes they charge for bags including carry ons, are very strict about the size of the free personal item and paid carry on and they charge way more at the airport than if you pay online at booking or check in for larger bags. Measurements and fees are clearly stated on the website. People still try to bring pieces that don’t meet the requirements and then yell at the employees when they have to pay extra. We had two great flights with early arrivals at our destination for both. Decently comfortable seats and the cabin was clean and new. The selections for onboard purchase are good and prices not outrageous. I’d definitely fly with them again but advise that you familiarize yourself in detail with their policies (in line with other ultra low fare carriers), procedures and fees.

### "Swoop refused to assist us"
Edmonton to Hamilton. We were late for our flight due to construction on the highway into Hamilton. Swoop refused to assist us in any way. Yet they have no trouble canceling flights and delaying flights continually. They would not reimburse us for the luggage costs ($140 for checked bags, which obviously did not go on the flight) or the seat preference ($60). We had to buy new tickets at the full cost, including paying again for the bags. We ended up leaving 2 days later. The flight that we did end up taking (still Swoop) was delayed half an hour, and our return flight from Edmonton was delayed almost 2 hours. I guess we were lucky, I saw a family trying to get home being told their flight was canceled and all they got was a refund.

### "Got what I paid for"
Really good service, on time and good behaviour from the staff both on and off the flight. Kind air hostess. Got what I paid for. Baggage in good condition. Will go the same next time and would recommend the same.

### "the service was good"
We had a round trip Edmonton-Hamilton with Swoop. Both flights were on time, reasonably comfortable and the service was good. Our bags were delivered quickly. The seats on both flights were auto-selected (no extra payment) and even though we were sitting in one row next to each other. Choosing Swoop I could save about 1K on flight tickets for my family of 4 so I used this money for something else.

### "very pleased with my flight"
I am very pleased with my flight to Abbotsford, BC from Hamilton, on and back. Their service was quick and professional and their flight crew were amazing. We were boarded promptly, the flight attendants were helpful and nice, and the pilots did a fantastic job, especially landing the planes. I am very happy that I chose to fly with Swoop and would recommend them to anyone looking to book a flight and save some money.

### "2 mins late they will not let you in"
I am really disappointed by swoop. It just that they are little cheaper I choose this for my Vegas trip. Firstly in Kelowna there was a lady at the front desk who almost took more than half an hour to check four of us in. Now let’s talk about 25th July 2019 from Vegas to Kelowna their flight was two hour late and even if you are 2 mins late they will not let you in. I missed my plane. Their ground staff was arguing with me for 15 min but they didn’t let me in. I had to pay 1600$ for booking another flight which I want swoop to pay me. And it wasted my hours in the airport waiting with my kids.

### "come late by 5 minutes"
Abbotsford to Winnipeg. The worst experience I ever had. Quality service is zero. Before departure the timing of check-in, they didn’t allow my big bag. I paid extra charges but they said it’s late. What is the fault if they fly late. It’s the fault of customers if they come late by 5 minutes.

### "why we assign the seats"
Not Verified |  Edmonton to Las Vegas. Ground staff do not know how to fix the problem of their system error, and make me wait until 10 min before boarding time. I did everything such as online check-in and go to counter for register again. Inside the flight, guest moved their seat because there's a lot of empty seats. Then, why we assign the seats, why we book it? Just sit where we want. And turn on their music while flight is going to destination, and staff only sell their items maybe because this will make them as bonus or somehow. What a nightmare flight company. I will never gonna use this flight again.

### "they said it was too heavy"
Not Verified |  Edmonton to Abbottsford. Single mom travelling with my two kids, all my kids had in their carry on bag was their books and they said it was too heavy and that if I don't throw the books away they will not let me board the flight. Never take Swoop.. Horrible customer service.

### "never fly with Swoop again"
Not Verified |  Edmonton to London. I will never fly with Swoop again. My first experience two weeks ago saw two delays that had us arriving far later than we should have. Included in the delay was an hour and a half wait on the aircraft because they couldn’t figure out why there were more people on the plane than had been checked at the gate. This experience, two weeks later, has left me stranded overnight because they delayed getting the baggage from one flight off their plane and so I missed my flight back home. Their response: tough luck. Lost fare. Rebook.

### "Very disappointed"
❎ Not Verified | Our flight was cancelled from Abbotsford to Hamilton. We had to sleep on the airport floor, not even the water fountain worked. Then they flew us to London, Ontario where I had to spend $150 bucks on an Uber to Hamilton to pick up my car. We paid for seats to sit together and we didn't get them. I have emailed Swoop 3 times no response. No one to answer the phone. Very disappointed.

### "Excellent experience"
Kelowna to Las Vegas. Excellent airline. All hidden fees associated with a low cost carrier are easy to decipher on their website. Check-in was easy & painless even travelling with a dog in the cabin. Front line staff were friendly & helpful. Airplane was clean, roomy & comfortable. The cabin staff were friendly & relaxed & funny, and provided continuous cabin service. The Capt was on the overhead advising us of change in arrival, weather etc & also let us know where to get our baggage & to go if needing extra help. Excellent experience. I travel to Vegas frequently to see family &;it's usually a 6- 7 hour journey at double the cost. 2 hours 20 min direct flight & with family. I will be flying monthly with this carrier. I'm giving a 8/10 only because my seat wouldn't recline.

### "nothing but excellent"
❎ Not Verified | Hamilton to Abbotsford. I feel sorry for all the inconvenienced travellers. My experience with Swoop was nothing but excellent: on time, friendly ground and cabin people, clean nice planes, unbeatable fare and you avoid YYZ and YVR.

### "Flight delay for two days"
Waste of money and big time waste. Never ever travel through Swoop. Front desk staff at Edmonton, airport is so rude. No customer service. Flight was delay for two days and they booked all the families with separate seat. Wasted three days of my trip. I had little boy under two and they booked separate seats I feel so bad for flight attendant. They have to deal with all the angry customers.

### "Do not fly Swoop"
Abbotsford to Hamilton. Do not fly Swoop. I won’t ever again. They cancelled a flight on me and booked one for a day and a half later. I was stranded in Abbotsford. Their customer service department would not answer the phone. This cost me another night in a hotel and a day’s lost wages as I missed work because of this. If you are thinking about flying Swoop to save money on a flight, just don’t. It will cost you more in the end.

### "Absolutely atrocious"
Not Verified |  Edmonton to Abbotsford. I fly regularly. Swoop is unhelpful and unreliable. The girl at the counter actually smiled when she said she couldn't issue a boarding pass because I was 5 min late. This was forty minutes before departure. They are the worst airline I have ever attempted to fly with. Absolutely atrocious. Do not trust them to be polite or helpful.

### "a first and only experience with Swoop"
We were scheduled to fly Swoop from Hamilton to Halifax on Tuesday July 9. When I went to check in, the site kept telling me I needed 24 hours to book, I was well within the 24 hours so I went into the site to check my itinerary and discovered they had rebooked us for Thursday July 11. I know our email was working as we had received one from Swoop on Friday July 5 saying our flight was going in 72 hours. When I tried calling their customer service (after saying I needed to pay $15.00 for the call) They had a recording saying a number of flights were cancelled and would not be taking phone calls, but to go to their website. We were not notified by email or text about the cancellation and were left on our own to find alternative flights. We managed to book a flight on Westjet out of Toronto. We had no choice as one of our party was flying home to Calgary on Westjet out of Halifax. This was a first and only experience with Swoop. I will never recommend this airline and have trouble believing they are at all associated with Westjet. As a result having booked at the last minute with Westjet we are out of pocket over $2000.00. This airline should not be in business and the Canadian regulators should shut it down.

### "staff refused to assist or help"
Hamilton to Halifax. We were left waiting at Hamilton Airport. We arrived just prior to 6 pm for a flight that was delayed and did not depart until 8.05 pm. The original departure time was 6.20pm, but we received email updates that told us the flight was delayed prior to us arriving! The Swoop staff refused to assist or help, and would not allow us to register even though I had email updates prior to arrival. We were told the plane was already boarded and the NSTB would not allow anybody access 30 mins prior to departure, but we were at the airport 40 minutes prior to! We have a 5 and 10 year old that has to wait at the airport until the next morning with a vending machine and Tim Horton’s that ran out of everything. We were then forced to purchase return one way flights back to Halifax at a ridiculously outrageous none-discounted price. As a retired veteran of the Canadian Forces and somebody who has represented Canada and the citizen of this great country all over the world, this has been the worst travelling experience I have ever encountered. I waited on the phone trying to contact customer support for over an hour before finally I gave up, not able to talk to anybody for advise or resolve! To not help, not offer any discount or return to offset the purchase of second set of tickets, and to have nobody that even has the ability to assist, borders on incompetence! My solution to you as an airline is to offer something back in return for the pain and suffering that my wife and grandchildren have incurred as a result of unprofessional service. We got home finally after 14 hours waiting at the worst airport in Canada, and would not recommend anybody ever use Swoop as a reliable choice for travel anywhere. I would be shocked if this Swoop is still in service by the end of the year!

### "our first trip with Swoop and will be our last"
Not Verified |  Received an email from Swoop cancelling my flight and rescheduling it for two days later, we were meant to fly from London to Halifax on July 9, 2019, they rescheduled this to July 11, 2019. Our trip was only for three days July 9, to July 12, so we would only get a nineteen hour vacation instead of three days. Our hotel is non cancellable so we have lost $480.00 and can't change the hotel dates as they are sold out. This is our first trip with Swoop and will be our last. The reason for cancelling the flight was unscheduled maintenance of two aircraft, they only have seven aircraft in their fleet. Why would Westjet not step in and take me and these other passengers from the five cancelled flights. Could you imagine what Swoop's attitude would be if I tried to cancel my flight and who much they would charge me. Bottom line, I have no offer of compensation, I can't take my three day vacation as hotels are full and I did buy a hotel on Expedia using some points and $480 it was non cancelable to get a good price. It will make me very wary of using Swoop and Expedia in the future. So Homewood Suites Halifax will get $480 for free and Expedia will get their commission. I'm retired on a fixed income and feel shafted by Swoop, be very careful booking with this airline it is not ready for prime time operation as an airline.

### "Vacation ruined"
❎ Not Verified | Hamilton to Ft Lauderdale. Vacation ruined! I am a family of 5 and Swoop cancelled our Monday flight and changed it to Friday. We all work. So who is going to be paying for our hotel rooms, our car rentals, our phone bill, our food, gas, etc? This trip will be now too expensive for us and it is all because of this airline. Hotels for 5 people are not cheap. The worst part is there is no one to call until 10 o'clock on Monday.

### "not book with them again"
Edmonton to Hamilton. Terrible airline. Staff uninformed and not helpful. Flight delayed 2 hours then after that when people got restless asking for answers they said it was then delayed another 12 hours for "maintenance". I've heard of this happening on other flights and I finally got bit. Serves me right for going with the bargain basement "Poop" airlines. Will not book with them again.

### "horrible and frustrating experience"
Not Verified |  Hamilton to Abbotsford. We were not notified of our flight cancellation until we finally arrived at the front desk after about two hours of public transit. The employees told us that the email couldn’t reach us because we booked as a third-party, but which plane cancels their flight one day prior to the actual flight date? And even after they said they sent the rescheduled flight confirmation email, we still did not receive it. They tried rescheduling for four days later which could not work, so instead they scheduled a flight at a different airport at least 100 km away and basically told us to pay for our own car rental and overnight stay fees. Not only that, but the employees seemed very unsympathetic and did not seem too focused on solving the issue at hand, even after being explained to about our situation of not having any way to travel to the scheduled airport. This was a horrible and frustrating experience, and I absolutely do not recommend this airline.

### "Cancellation without notice"
Hamilton to Abbotsford. Cancellation without notice for our flight out of Hamilton to Abbotsford. Our flight was rescheduled it without asking for 4 days later. When online to find the earliest fights, found one which can only take passengers and moved other 2 to different flight for time being, on hold, past 2 hours and 7mins, this is not right. I understand flight cancellations can occur but at lest have your reps available to answer phone calls?

### "They cancelled the flight"
Hamilton to Vancouver. Horrible airline! They cancelled the flight last minute and their call Centre is actually closed if you can believe that. What airline closes their call Centre? And they charge you $15 to call their call Centre. They cancel the flight on you with no alternative and their call Centre is closed. This is unbelievable.

### "Is Swoop ever on time?"
Hamilton to Edmonton. Is Swoop ever on time? This is the third time I have booked a flight on Swoop snd the third time it has been delayed! The first flight by 2 hours, the second by 45 min, but this time takes the cake! First an advised 4.5 hour delay, then once at the airport another 2 hour delay the a third of 45 min for a total of over 7 hours! This is ridiculous! Worst service of any Canadian airline ever! Do not use Swoop, you will regret it.

### "Cancellation without notice"
Cancellation without notice for a flight out of Hamilton toward Winnipeg and they rescheduled it without asking for 7 days later. Their employees were cold and rude. I had to to pay for transport to Toronto airport and purchase a new ticket at more than twice the price. Dont use Swoop.

### "on hold for an hour and thirty minutes"
My first flight was delayed by 45 minutes with no explanation. Fine, that's not terrible. But on the flight I was an idiot and left my purse behind. That's on me. But trying to get a hold of anyone has been a nightmare. First time I was on hold for an hour and thirty minutes. And they said we're basically closed for the day, nothing has been turned in, call back on Monday. Monday I was on hold for two hours before I had to give up. Eventually drove to the airport because I was upset, they said they have nothing. Which essentially means it was stolen. Which is pretty upsetting. So I am currently on hold again to double check, its been 1 hour and 44 minutes so far. Oh yeah, and on my flight home they delayed the flight three times, without sending us a single email.

### "not notified of flight cancellation"
Not Verified |  Edmonton to Hamilton. Was not notified of flight cancellation. Been running around for almost an hour trying to get another flight. Very poor service and unprofessional. I would rather walk to Hamilton than choose this airline again.

### "Worst experience ever"
Hamilton to Edmonton. I was suppose to fly on Thursday june 27th at 7:45, I had already checked in online. I arrived there at 7:05. We wait in line for another 5 minutes when someone approaches and tells us  we're late & we can't go. So they made us rebook and pay full price for our next flight which was Saturday June 29th, and when we got there they delayed our flight for almost 5 hours & refused to refund anything to us. So they charge us full price for being 5 minutes late but keep us for almost 5 hours without a refund or even an apology. On top of that our luggage was only 25 grams over & they wanted us to pay another $50 for that. Worst experience ever.

### "check your luggage weight"
Not Verified |  Hamilton to Edmonton. Air ticket price was good but they gave you extra hassle and botheration for Laguage even you pay for extra checked bag including one paid checked bag. Please make sure to check your luggage weight and size specially hand luggage - they will give you hard time even you paid for extra checked bag. They will charge you less in ticket but will charge you high in luggage. Also they will not provide you any free water. You have to buy water.

### "I was 4 minutes late to check in"
I arrived at the airport to leave from London Ontario to Edmonton. Due to a traffic accident I was 4 minutes late to check in. This I own however it was beyond my control. When I arrived no one from Swoop was at their desk. So there I am trying to board my plane and I cannot find anyone to assist me and my flight was leaving very soon so I was in a bit of a panic. Finally a Swoop employee showed up at the desk I tried to check my bag in and was refused saying I was too late. She just kept saying "I have no control over anything I cannot do anything for you" and she had a terrible attitude. I had to probe her to find out if there is another flight I could take, she didn't even attempt to offer any solutions and when she told me about another flight I could take they wanted an additional $400. She told me to just call Swoop's number and basically it wasn't her problem so she didn't want to deal with this anymore. The West Jet (who owns Swoop by the way) employee as well as the Air Canada employee saw how upset I was and offered comfort and care. I waited on hold for 45 minutes before I finally got an agent. I asked for a supervisor and when I finally got one on the phone (this is now over an hour on the phone) they offered me nothing other than for me to spend double than what I paid for the flight originally. I understand Swoop's business model is based around providing extremely cheap flights in Canada, the feeling I got based on the information provided to me by Swoop was basically "you got a cheap flight so we don't owe you anything in the way of customer service". I was not refunded, I was not given an option to pay the difference for a flight leaving the next day and I was offered nothing for a situation beyond my control.

### "won't be flying them again"
Not Verified |  Abbotsford to Hamilton. I drove an hour out of Vancouver without sleep to a smaller airline at 330am in order to make a 6am flight by Swoop because it was cheaper. At 5am they cancelled my flight. I had to be in London Ontario for work the next day. They said 4 passengers from the cancelled flight could go to Hamilton on a later flight, which was my only option. I was told I would not be reimbursed for any transportation costs, the difference in flight cost, or the fees I paid for upgraded seats on my original flight. I arrived much later on a Sunday evening to Hamilton, requiring a 150 dollar uber ride to London. Awful experience and zero accountability by Swoop. They barely even pretended to apologize. I won't be flying them, or subsequently Westjet again.

### "they canceled the flight"
Abbotsford to London. 45 minutes before take off and they canceled the flight because a crew member called in sick. Apparently they are really good at staffing. They rebooked me on a flight 3 days later. You had one job, Swoop, one job. Can’t really rate that flight since it never took off.

### "get what you pay for"
Hamilton to Halifax. I fly Swoop once a month and have since September 2018. The staff are courteous and helpful, planes are clean and new, and you get what you pay for. As in, bring a personal item and pay nothing more - I love that. Why spend 500 dollars on a flight that lets you bring a carryon when I don't need that carryon? Swoop is a great option to travel for less - honestly you get more than you pay for.

### "crew member called in sick"
Not Verified |  It goes without saying that buying a ticket with a so-called discount carrier prepares you for an experience different from a higher-priced airline. Let's call it lower expectations. However, my experience with Swoop today is something I had not accounted for. I received an email early this morning saying my son's and I flight from London, Ontario to Abbotsford, B.C. was cancelled. Reason? A crew member called in sick. I'm not kidding. Now we are booked on a flight that will get us into Abbotsford tomorrow - a Monday at 2 pm. So, one person calling in sick results in, let's be conservative and say 100 people unable to go to work tomorrow. To say nothing of the holidayers having their plans, and possible flight connections, thrown into chaos. In addition, our planned ride from Abbotsford to our home in North Vancouver, which was going to be my husband today, will now be a cab ride that I'm guessing will be around $80. Of course, my husband could always call in sick tomorrow to pick us up, just to add to work disruption this one person's actions have caused. That said, it's not the crew member's fault. It's Swoops. Are you really telling me they do not have on-call crew members for such occasions? If not, they need to seriously consider a business plan rethink or maybe just shut down their entire operation. Needless to say, this first experience with flying Swoop will be our last. Oh, and one final indignity. I called Swoop today and guess what? Their office is closed on Sundays! Wow.

### "do not fly Swoop"
We had planned to be at the airport for our flight home from Hamilton Ontario to Abbotsford, BC, approx 2 hours before our flight was scheduled to board. Now, because of accidents on the highway we arrived as they were boarding, approximately 5 minutes late. I had checked in online, so it should have all been fine. As we approached the counter, we were told we were not going to make it on this flight! I did have a little freak out, and then they told us that we could make it on the plane, but our luggage would not! They told us we had to hurry to board, but gave us no options for our luggage, and even said that if we abandon it to board that we would be charged. So, with no options, we had a friend come pick up our luggage and we quickly boarded without our 3 large checked bags that I already paid $150 to have put on the plane. We are now home with no luggage. Now, finally after being on the phone for a day and a half with various companies, I have found a way to get it back that will now take about a week or so to arrive and will cost me another $200. So, now the Cheap airline Swoop, will cost me way over the amount it would have cost me on another airline that would have cared more about me and my family's situation. So in short, do not fly Swoop.

### "This is absolutely ridiculous"
Not Verified |  I know this is a budget airline and you kind of get what you pay for. I expect them to up charge for every little thing but this goes so far beyond that. My friends booked both our flights to Vegas from London, Ontario and due to a family emergency I had to fly home to Vancouver. I called in and waited an hour to cancel my flight as you cannot cancel partial reservations online. I knew there was a $100 plus ta cancellation fee but then they told me that the credit only goes on the primary passenger. Even though I am cancelling only my ticket as the 2nd passenger. This is idiotic but I said fine can she book my flight for me using that credit and she can't. It can only be used for when she herself is flying. This is absolutely ridiculous, nowhere on the site does it say this. If I am cancelling my flight why would the credit only be usable to her. That means I literally lose the entire cost of my round trip flight. I have an account with Swoop and have flown before they could easily transfer the credit to me as the ticket cancelled is mine!

### "flight was delayed by 24 hours"
Las Vegas  to Edmonton. My flight was delayed by 24 hours. I am in the military and have a contract that requires me to be on base NLT Monday. That gave me two full days to pack and prepare after my trip. Had it been a couple hour delay it would have been fine. So I went to the airport to find alternate arrangements. But there were no swoop agents at the airport to talk to. I called the number on the website and it mentioned paying $15 just for the convenience of calling rather than writing in. I was on hold for over an hour and no one picked up. So I had to find alternate arrangements on my own. I ended up having to pay $660 as that was the only option and it was the least seat. The sign for swoop changed from delayed to cancelled. There has been zero compensation for the flight, for the new flight, or for the ticket I purchased to go to the comic con which I had to miss since the new flight was much earlier and I had already bought tickets. Then I had a half hour window to drive around Vegas to drop off my rental car and get back to the airport which was approximately a fifteen minute ride away plus two shuttles to get to the terminal 3. I am not impressed and highly recomend against Swoop. I'm lucky enough to have got a flight out. The rest of the people were told I took the last seat, therefore they all need to wait a day to get new flights, pay for food and pay for a hotel. This is ridiculous.

### "I find this very unfair"
Not Verified |  Great airline, however I do have a complaint. My husband is 6’1” and requires more leg room. We paid an extra $57 for each of us (4x$57) round trip. The aircraft was not full, and several people who were in the less expensive seats were allowed to move to the $57 seats. I find this very unfair. We should be reimbursed or the switches should not be allowed. I hope swoop reviews this.

### "can’t beat the low ticket price"
Las Vegas to Edmonton. Wanted a cheap getaway to Vegas and thats exactly what I got. You can’t beat the low ticket price and the “only pay for what you need” model. You’re buying a seat and that’s about it, if you decide you need a bunch of baggage, drinks and food etc it’ll cost you. If you’re realistic about what you’re buying, you’ll have a great experience. Probably the friendliest cabin crew I’ve ever seen and the check-in agent even waived my overweight bag fee because I was only a pound over. Seats are incredibly tight if you’re tall but worth it for the savings

### "you get what you pay for"
Hamilton to Las Vegas return. I will begin by saying that flying out of Hamilton was a much more relaxing experience than flying out of Toronto. Both legs arrived relatively on time (with about a 15-20 minute delay). Boarding was speedy and efficient in both instances and the overall experience was more than acceptable. My only gripe with Swoop is their luggage policy. I have flown with other Ultra low cost carriers in Europe (Pegasus, Ryanair, EasyJet) and never had I dealt with the type of scrutiny that these guys place on luggage. I was flying down with just a personal item on both legs. Leaving Hamilton, it was clear that my medium sized backpack fit comfortably under the seat (even though in all fairness when I tried to get it to fit in their "luggage size testers" it was virtually impossible. This was just a regular school sized backback, so this is a word of caution to anyone thinking of stuffing a backpack and thinking of getting away for a weekend with just a personal item. Leaving Vegas to return back to Hamilton is where I encountered my first issue (and probably only issue on this trip). Immediately at the check in counter I noticed that they had people aside (5-6 others) which they had marked as having bags too big to count as personal items. I was told that my backpack was too big and that I too, would have to pay to either have it checked or carry it on board (both fees were in the $75+ range). This is a word of caution to anyone thinking of getting away with it. Pay for the bag or make sure you have a small backpack and can make it work. They gave me a break this time, but based on all the other reviewers here it is very apparent that this is not the case most of the time. Wifi was slow on the flight, the menu surprisingly didn't even have cold sandwiches available, however, snacks and drinks are very reasonably priced ($5-$7 for beers or spirits, most snacks in the $3-$6 range). The aircrafts are all relatively new ex-WestJet B737-800 series planes and in both instances during my flights were clean planes. Cabin crew staff were pleasant and were helpful with whatever issues people had around me. Overall, you get what you pay for. In my case, if I am paying for my flights out of pocket I will definitely consider these guys again. I saved at least $200 Canadian with them for my round trip. Final words - measure your bags and don't take your chances. I got away with it this time but I will most definitely pay for a bag ahead of time on my next flights with them at the time of booking.

### "I was deeply disappointed"
Not Verified |  I was deeply disappointed with my first (and last) flight with Swoop Airlines while recently traveling from Edmonton to Mesa with my two travel companions. One of my friends arrived at the airport later than she planned due to traffic. Upon arrival at the terminal 59 minutes ahead of flight time she discovered that there were no agents at the counter. She had already checked in the night before but still had to check her bag. Not being able to locate a Swoop representative at any counter, she called us and we notified the gate agent who informed us that “There is nothing that we can do.” After repeated attempts to get help, we were told to tell her that it was too late for them to get the luggage (now 45-50 minutes before the flight). She was willing to fly without her luggage in order to make the flight with us so she left her luggage with her husband and went through security and customs to the gate. We were told upon boarding that she would be let on by the flight attendants. However when she got to the gate the same unhelpful gate agents were in the process of closing the door and would not let her enter. My friend was forced to rebook her flight on a different airline at full last minute pricing We will never again fly with Swoop Airlines and we all shocked by the lack of effort and poor customer service displayed by their agents.

### "actually been cancelled"
Hamilton to Halifax. 3 hours before our flight we got an email saying our reservation had be “changed”. It’s actually been cancelled. When we looked at the new “departure time” it was 3 days later. That’s half our trip! We can’t get money back from our Airbnb bookings because it’s too last minute and further more, customer support doesn’t open until 5 hours after this email. Fast forward. I’ve been waiting in Support queue for 1 hr 45 mins. How am I even supposed to problem solve. Ridiculous excuse for an airline, budget or not. We didn’t even take it because of price, it was just the closest and most convenient flight and time. Never again.

### "such short notice given"
First an email was sent at 3 AM and 4:40 AM the day of our flight saying its delayed. They claimed that it was for maintenance reasoning but checking the numbers of the flight coming from Edmonton it appears that it was because they did not have enough people flying. This is all done at the cost of the customer so that they can save money. A 10 dollar voucher was provided and no other refund. I have made appointment based on this and even played extra to take the morning flight because of my commitments. This is such an inconvenience, with such short notice given and no other options provided other than a 10 dollar food voucher.

### "backpack need to pay as carry on"
We started our short escape from Canada to Las Vegas and everything was excellent. Flight on time, outstanding ground and cabin service. Brand new aircraft. However, in our way back, during the check in at Las Vegas airport, everything changed. The agent was nice to advise us that the backpacks my wife and I were using as personal items may not fit the permited size. These two backpacks were the same we used in our way in and no issue was noted by the Canadian ground staff. After taking some items (sweater and a pair of flipflop) they fitted in. When ready to finalize the check in, the supervisor approached to my wife in a very rude way to let her know that the purse she was wearing was considered a personal item so the backpack need to pay as carry on (forty some dollars). The supervisor continued almost in a harrassment way pushing us to pay the fee for the carry on. Only for a matter of proud, I stuffed my pants and jacket pockets to make able for the backpack to fit in the company policy measurements. The issue of the fee or the size was not the problem. The harrassment, rudeness and disrespectful way of being treated will make us never flight in Swoop.

### "They were rude, abrupt"
Las Vegas to Edmonton. I booked online a return flight from Las Vegas. I tried to check in, but stupidly I was travelling without my credit card. I went to the counter, put my checked bag on the scale only to be told that I selected carry on instead of checked. Oops, my bad, can I just pay the difference? No sorry, you need to pay an additional 50$ usd. Ok, I only have Canadian cash left. They pointed me to a terminal that makes prepaid debit cards. I leave the line, borrow 50$ from my friend, make the card and come back and it gets declined. It takes .25 for the decline so now I don’t have enough for the transaction. They call a supervisor, she says it’s not their problem the card didn’t work, they can’t adjust the price to 49.75, they can’t check my bag. I ask them to try to figure something out, I have jumped through all their hoops, and the system isn’t working in my favour. No sorry. So thankfully my friend came to my rescue and paid the 50$ on her credit card. So I phone the debit card 1-800 only to find that swoop is considered an international transaction and that’s not allowed. I am certain that someone at the desk would have known that, as they are the ones who instructed me to do this. They were rude, abrupt, and if in fact Swoop gives them no leeway in order to make such small concessions or overrides then this is not the company I choose to deal with in the future.

### "a wonderful experience"
Edmonton to Winnipeg. I had a wonderful experience on this airline. This is a low cost carrier so don't expect any extras. As long as you read the instructions on the website and the numerous emails they send you before the flight you will be perfectly fine. I brought a small briefcase bag and it was alright and I did not have to purchase a bag. In the past I have brought a backpack or carry on and had to pay but if you do it beforehand it is a lot cheaper then doing it the day of.

### "it was a great experience"
I just flew London to Edmonton last week and it was a great experience both ways! Very happy I took a chance on this airline despite the bad reviews, but people should understand that you're getting a seat for cheap and everything else is extra. I read all the rules on the Swoop website about checked bags, carryons and personal items, arriving 90 minutes prior, etc. If you follow the rules Swoop clearly outlines (and emails you about multiple times prior to your flight) you will have a great experience! The planes are also old WestJet planes so the seats are the same size as the standard planes and they even have USB ports. Will absolutely be flying with Swoop again.

### "forced us to check our backpack"
Las Vegas to Hamilton. I’ve flown with Swoop a few times now and have never experienced an issue with my backpack which fits nicely under the seat. While the website gives a size, it clearly says “must fit under the seat”. Apparently the staff at Vegas decided to play mall cop and forced us to check in our backpack for an extra 50USD. 4 of us were all lined up at the desks with the same issue. We all flew to Vegas without issues. It’s within their right to do what they did, but in the process, they ended up with 4 more very frustrated and unhappy passengers who will think twice about using their services. Both my wife and I (she has flown a lot with Swoop) had a feeling of “I never want to travel with them again). When all is said and done, we don’t feel like we got a good deal anymore.

### "24 hour policy to get a cancel"
Hamilton to Winnipeg. When confirming our flight to book baggage I rebooked a baggage & carryon for both of us travelling. I emailed 3 notices immediately to correct this. No response. I also called 3 times waiting on line over 15 minutes each time - again no response. When checking in this morning, the customer service called but could not get any response. & suggested I call again, because you had a 24 hour policy to get a cancel on those charges. There is an extra $150 charged on my credit card.

### "ground crew has to be flexible and less condescending"
It's my first time to take Swoop. Happy for the airfare RT from Hamilton to Edmonton. On returning from Edmonton, a ground crew member did not consider a petition that I will sit beside my niece. Though we booked separately, I asked him if we could sit together. Found out that my niece was in seat 10 and I was on the 26th row. What was disappointing was that my niece was sitting alone with no seat companions while I was seated in between 2 persons. Just to note that Swoop ground crew has to be flexible and less condescending.

### "Would definitely recommend"
Hamilton to Edmonton. Surprised my fiancé with a trip to see his parents in Edmonton but was very worried that our trip would ruined after reading all the awful reviews. Glad to say that the entire trip went off without any issues. The flights were on time, the staff was awesome and the flight itself was pretty good. Would definitely recommend.

### "the service is brutal"
Abbotsford to Edmonton with Swoop. I have traveled on over 20 different airlines. This airline is by far the worst airline I have experienced. Once you add up seat selection, stroller check in, play pen which we require when traveling with a child under 2. Not only is it more expensive but the service is brutal. If you call in to customer service they will charge you $15. Not sure how long this airline will last to be in business.

### "Fantastic discount airline"
Halifax to Hamilton. Fantastic discount airline! No issues either way. The booking was very clear about baggage and price was outstanding. If you want more you would need to pay a lot more to get some entertainment and a small glass of coke not worth the extra. Will definitely use Swoop again.

### "Keep up this great service Swoop"
We flew from Hamilton to Puerto Vallarta, MX on Saturday April 27th to Saturday May 4th, 2019. We had an awesome experience with Swoop and will travel with them again for sure! We were very impressed with how easy it was travelling in and out of Hamilton airport. A smaller airport so less confusion and crowds and a Tim Hortons right! Our experience on every level from bag check, boarding and flight crew, both going and returning was seamless, and the flight left on time both ways! You do have to walk to and from the plane on the tarmac in Hamilton airport, but there is a ramp (not stairs) from the plane. Assistance is also available if needed. In PVR there was a full walkway from the plane door to the airport for both flights. You can use the inflight services at a charge, however, we always download movies on our ipad so we have our own entertainment. Swoop is a basic flight service offered at excellent prices, which means read and know the details and what to expect. You cannot pay lower prices and expect all the bells and whistles for free. Common sense! Our plane was close to full both going and returning so they are doing something right! Keep up this great service Swoop! We will be travelling with you again in the near future!

### "a great experience"
Not Verified |  I flew Swoop for the first time one way from Tampa to Hamilton. The check in at Tampa airport was great. There was no line up and the staff were very friendly. We boarded our flight right on time and took off a few minutes early. The flight was great and the flight attendants were friendly and professional. We landed ten minutes early. Overall it was a great experience and I wouldn’t hesitate to fly Swoop again!

### "they didn't charge me last time"
Edmonton to London with Swoop. Worst ever. Staff member at the ground assistance wanted me to pay $100 for just an extra .30 kg on the top of $42 I paid for my 23 kg baggage. Last March I was traveling with Swoop from Edmonton to Brampton with 2 personal backpack and my suitcase with no charge. Today they charged me with $89 for my suitcase. Even though I swear to them that they didn't charge me last time and todays flight was half empty. They also threatened me to deny my departure and cancel my flight.

### "Very friendly staff"
Not Verified |  Hamilton to Toronto via Edmonton. Very friendly staff. Clean aircraft. Decent wine. I saw the staff help with a fainting passenger they did a good job. Check-in was okay but the flight attendants truly went above and beyond

### "last time we will fly with swoop "
Edmonton to London. This is the second and the very last time we will fly with swoop Both experiences have been terrible 1st time was Edmonton to Hamilton and return Flight to Hamilton was delayed by 5 hrs And flight back was delayed by 11 hrs (Travelling with 2 small children and I needed to be at my destination for an appt for my dad which I had to rush to find someone to go with him) Today flight from Edmonton to London (delayed and no idea when we will depart- apparently they need to find an new 1st officer - this excuse is awful) Have people on standby seriously! In my position I can’t just not show up and if I can’t go to work I need to find someone to replace me).

### "charged CA$89 for carry on"
I travelled from Hamilton to Edmonton and my flight was delayed from 5.35am to 8.40am. That wasn’t the worst, I brought the exact same baggage on board from Hamilton to Edmonton and everything was fine. However, when I was flying back from Edmonton to Hamilton on Flight 104 on 24th April 2019 23:55, I got charged CA$89 extra for my carry on. The staff was not polite or empathetic at all because we got through and flew with the exact same baggage from Hamilton to Edmonton. It was ridiculous and her tone was rude even though our baggage dimensions were within the limit. She also misread the amount to charge on my credit cards and did not even apologize for her mistake. I have travelled often and with many low cost carriers but this is the first time I am being charged for a carry-on with bad customer service. When I boarded the flight, there were no smiles or help given and I witnessed another passenger being scolded for having a jacket on her lap. I will not recommend this airline to anyone.

### "Not helpful at all"
Hamilton to Halifax. Besides the outrageous hidden fees and uncomfortable seats, the flight was delayed for an hour as one out of the 4 staff had to leave home sick and we had to wait for a new attendant. On return from Halifax flight delayed again for no reason, only update I had was an email. Boarding time comes and still no new update so I ask customer service at the desk and she says "I have no idea when we will board". I said can you at least update us so we dont have to keep asking, her reply was "you'll know when we announce the boarding time". I don't mind the delay things happen what I mind is the attitude of the personal. Not helpful at all. First and last time I use this airline.

### "found the experience great"
Abbotsford to Hamilton. This is the first time flying with Swoop and we found the experience to be great. We were travelling with two young children. Our first flight (red eye) was delayed 2 hrs, but the first part of the delay we were notified by email way in advance so we just left home later. This was due to the inbound plane being delayed an hour. The second part of the delay was due to a medical issue with a passenger. So really not a lot could have been done. I'm sure a lot of passengers were a little upset as it was late and it was a full flight. We upgraded to more legroom seats on our first flight, and this is so worth it on the overnight flights. The seats barely recline. Maybe 4 inches, so don't expect to sleep. The extra room was great as we had one child sleep on two seats, and the other on the floor. Thankfully it was a smooth flight so no seat belt lights came on. We had regular seats on the way back and its much more cramped. But not as bad as Air Canada Rouge. Do not waste your money on the onboard internet. It is incredibly slow. Basically makes old dial up seem fast. You can't load Youtube or Netflix. Its only good for light browsing and email (if that). I did complain about this to the service provider and they refunded me. Its quite expensive too. $12 for 90 minutes. Make sure to download the Swoop app before coming to the airport though. Its the only way to access internet. There are no shows or movies available so you need to download these to a phone or tablet before hand. You can access swoopstream.com while in flight to see remaining travel time and altitude, but that's about it. Recommend buying food and drink after security then bring it on board. Not a lot of options on the plane. On the way home there was a huge line up at check in/bag drop due to two full flights at the same time. Staff separated the flights and expedited the earlier flight to Abbotsford through. The flight actually left a little early because of this. Staff was friendly and helpful. Will use again without hesitation.

### "Terrible customer service."
Hamilton to Halifax. Terrible airline. They delayed our flight from 8am to 4pm. Spent 50 min on hold to be told nothing they can do. Lost a day of my holiday. When we boarded there were empty seats behind us and I asked if we could sit there. They said I would have to pay! Terrible customer service.

### "great start to our long weekend"
This was my first trip with Swoop and my first time flying out of Abbotsford. The check in staff was very friendly and helpful. We had checked in online and was seated towards the back; however the check in agent moved us up. Additionally, she was very helpful with questions about the app and the airport. Thank you very much for a great start to our long weekend excursion out east.

### "never getting my money back"
Winnipeg to Hamilton. I booked a flight and purchased a ModiFly, it's an option where you can change your flight if something comes up. A month and half before my flight I had to change my flight dates due to exams but they would not let me change it because my credit card was apparently "declined" so I sent them the copy of my bank statement, the receipt that they sent me and my reservation code which they would clearly not sent out without a complete payment. I tried contacting them for the entire month of March, starting March 4th, 2019 through the phone and email but I was put on hold for minimum of 20 minutes everyday (fyi, I would call 3 times a day) and the email was either an automated one or the agent will not have an idea what I was talking about when there was an entire email thread prior to the most recent one. It is now April 18th, 2019; no solutions, no email and no follow up. I'm going to miss my flight due to exams, I can't use the service that I paid for (ModiFly), I can't cancel my flight and get credit due to their website error which they never fixed and I'm never getting my money back (est. $350).

### "would fly again with this airline"
Both flights from Hamilton to Winnipeg and back again, five days later were flawless. I chose not to buy any extra comforts, just a regular seat. On line ticket purchasing was simple and easy. The airline contacted me via email that departure times were near. Online boarding pass acquisitions were easy to arrange. Ground service was genuinely helpful. Service on the flights was also friendly and professional. The price for my ticket was very reasonable. I was quite comfortable, and would fly again with this airline in a heart beat.

### "my flight was cancelled"
Edmonton to Hamilton. I got en email late afternoon saying that my flight was cancelled for that night and rebooked to the next night. They stated it was weather but when I called my family it was hardly raining and I later found out other aircraft were landing in Hamilton where I was due to go. I suspect that the flight wasn’t full so they rebooked it. This left me in a huge pickle and because of weather they won’t help with food or hotels. Plus the email said to contact their call center but guess what, it was closed on Sundays!

### "never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Will never fly with them again. Flight cancelled from Edmonton under claims of weather in Hamilton. They rebooked for an entire 24 hours later with no accommodation at all because it was weather related. Funny how the same flight time out of Abbotsford into Hamilton was just fine. Apparently the weather in Hamilton was fine for that plane to land but not ours for the very same time. It’s easy to say it is a weather concern to avoid any costs to the airline to accommodate passengers. My guess is the flight wasn’t full so they bumped everyone. Never again Swoop.

### "my worst experience"
Hamilton to Abbotsford. This was my worst experience with an airline ever! The landing was supposed to be in Abbotsford. Due to the weather condition they couldn't land there, and they took us to Vancouver. Once we landed, there was no one from the airline to accommodate anything for the passengers. Everyone was replying by "we don't work for Swoop and have no idea what you need to do". I had to ask my family to drive all the way from Abbotsford to Vancouver to pick us up. Later I understood I shouldn't have asked them, since the great customer service (who happens to be answering only through Twitter) did not compensate for anything, since I didn't take a cap. No voucher for food, and not even a simple apology for it. Fast forward, on the return on the worst day of this winter in Vancouver, they started to keep changing the time of the travel. we got confused with the timings and on our way to the airport we stuck in the snow and arrived with a little delay to the airport. They didn't let us to get onboard, even though they flew two hours after our arrival to the airport. Majority of the staff in the airport were rude. They started yelling at us and making nonsense jokes, finally one of them told us, it takes us so much time to get a hold of someone, and it's not worth our time to do so about your issue. We lost the flight at 2am and couldn't find anyone to talk with (they said send a message to the Twitter page, they might come back to you tomorrow). No one to assist us to book in another flight, or help us to understand what we needed to do in the middle of the night. We went back to our family's and booked another flight with another airline and will never look back again to travel with this airline.

### "I recommend Swoop"
Edmonton to Hamilton. I recommend Swoop to any who may be concerned reading other reviews. Everything was as expected no surprises You read what u have to do and all is good. We departed on time arrived on time were well informed and had no issues.

### "cancelled as we were boarding"
Flight was cancelled as we were boarding. Medical emergency of a Cabin Crew staffer. No spare crew. Aircraft returned to Hamilton empty. We were left to make our own arrangements to return to Canada or accept a return flight to Hamilton 4 days later. We were advised to keep receipts of expenses and submit them to Swoop for reimbursement. We incurred expenses of over $1100 and have been unable to connect to Swoop by e-mail or phone for reimbursement.

### "Avoid them like the plague"
Not Verified |  After much contemplation and horror story awareness I decided to make the mistake of flying Swoop for my first time last week from Edmonton to Las Vegas. Flight was supposed to take off at 3:30 and it was delayed an hour, no problems. We drove the 2 hours to the airport to have the same flight delayed another 3 times, before it was cancelled completely. Every person I asked why it was delayed gave me a completely different answer so none of their stories lined up. So at this point we ran across the airport hoping to get another flight that night. Coincidentally we missed the next Westjet flight out by about 15 minutes, at least now we know they can successfully plan out screwing us out of any other options rather than their own booked flights. So now I start the fight trying to get my money back from Booked hotels, meals, etc. Avoid them like the plague. I'll probably try again in a couple years if they are still around, maybe at that point they will have sorted out their issues.

### "they are regularly delayed"
Abbotsford to Edmonton. Yes this airline is a cheaper option, however less flight times are available, usually only 1 or two a day. You can end up being the same price as Westjet or Air Canada if you include baggage and pick your seats. All this is alright except one thing to keep in mind is it’s great if your not on a schedule. Either this airline doesn’t have enough planes to keep up with their scheduling or they are just inexperienced but they are regularly delayed. So a short hour and 15 minute flight, turns out your waiting at the airport and your flight is 45 minutes delayed on top of your flight. At Christmas my flight was the only one delayed at the airport and it was 2 hours delayed. They need to improve.

### "definitely fly with Swoop again"
Abbotsford to Hamilton. Swoop righted a wrong! I had a fantastic flight out to B.C. to visit my daughter in February. I loved the easy access to Hamilton airport, and everything went according to plan. The return trip was another story. Ontario was suffering from a severe ice storm on the day I was to fly home. I decided to cancel my return flight... big mistake. However, the flight was still going, just delayed, so I rebooked on the same flight... at an extra cost of $300.00! When I arrived at Abbotsford airport, I explained the situation to the Swoop attendant, and she refunded the new ticket cost, and I was back in my original seat and all was good. Although the plane was delayed, I was able to board and prepare to return to Hamilton. Moments before take off... I was pulled off the plane, as my name did not appear on the manifest. I was so distraught as I was travelling alone, and I felt stranded and alone. The next plane back to Hamilton was the next night at 10 pm, which meant another full day of waiting, and not returning home until 6 am 2 days later... overnight flight! I chose to book a new flight out of Abbotsford through WestJet, which was the next morning. At least, I would be home within 24 hours. I booked a night at a local hotel, and flew out at 8 am the next morning. When I returned home an emotional wreck and exhausted, I decided to pursue a complaint for the cost and emotional stress of this situation. I am not one to complain, but I felt strongly about explaining the situation to Swoop. I was out a lot of money because of the WestJet flight and hotel booking! When I emailed the airline, they apologized to me for THEIR error. Not only did they pay for my WestJet flight home, but they also paid for my hotel! I was happy that I was compensated for their error and that Swoop had the integrity to fix their mistake within a reasonable time frame. I had great communication with the contact person, and emails flowed daily. I will definitely fly with Swoop again!

### "Worst customer service"
Worst customer service ever. Flights are delayed on constant basis. I booked a flight from Abbotsford to Hamilton 10:20am, arrival was at 5:30. And my return flight was next day 7:30am. But my departure from Abbotsford first got delayed from 10:20 to 11:40 and another delay from 11:40 to 12:50. I could not reach Hamilton before 8pm and could not meet whom i wanted to meet. Swoop did not reschedule or refunded after so many requests. Basically I paid $500 to touch down Hamilton airport and come back next morning.

### "absolute cheapest price"
Not Verified |  This airline is great, if you understand how it works, and relax. The price shown get you and a bag on a plane, to your destination, this means that you arrive when you booked with a bag (backpack, duffle bag etc) I flew from Hamilton to Vegas, round trip, in November for about $180 Canadian. I didn't pay extra for a checked bag, or seat selection, because i didn't need it. I did buy a beer on the plane, for I believe $5 Canadian. The plane flew, I arrived on time and safe, and most likely wouldn't have gone to Vegas if I had to pay what other airlines were asking. Im going to Florida in October, 4 people and the cost is $1200, round trip, for everyone. I checked other airlines leaving from Toronto, and for 4 people its over $3500. If Swoop wasn't around I wouldn't be going. I'm not sure what people expect. They are offering Canadians the absolute cheapest price to get you in the air and to your destination. if you want extras theres a cost. Why should I pay the same amount when all i have is a backpack, when someone else is packing 4 suitcases for a week vacation.

### "get what you pay for"
Abbotsford to Puerto Vallarta. You get what you pay for - this is a discount airline that we used to fly our family cheaply to Mexico and back on Spring Break. Pros: the price was good, the flights left and arrived on time, our luggage arrived safely, the staff were pleasant, the plane (a former WestJet plane) was clean and appeared to be in good condition. Cons: anything extra costs you money, including choosing your seat, seats with more legroom, both checked and carry-on bags, all snacks, and all drinks (including water). There is no real food on-board, not even sandwiches, so you must bring your own if you want something healthy to eat. The seats are thinly padded and not very comfortable. There is no on-board entertainment although apparently there is a Swoop app you can download ahead of time that will enable you to have some form of entertainment on your own device (we did not know about this beforehand so could not use it). Communication about boarding our flight in Mexico was poor - we were told that check-in would start at 4:20 pm for our 4:50 flight, then were surprised to hear a “final call” announcement at 4:20. Apparently we had to take a bus out to the plane, which was sitting on the tarmac some distance away from the terminal - we barely made it on the bus in time.

### "credits expire in 90 days"
Not Verified |  We were traveling regularly from Winnipeg to Hamilton as my wife's father was nearing the end of his life. We needed to change the date of our flight and, after calling into the customer service department, were advised to simply cancel instead as the flight money would be held in a travel account. Now we tried to use the flight credit and found out, after calling again, that flight credits expire in 90 days without notification. No email communication at the time of credit, or any other form notifying us of the expiry. (If you scour the website you can find it but not unless you are very diligent.) The Customer service resp are not at all empathetic and offer no apology on this policy. They may be owned by WestJet but their customer service is horrible in comparison. Seems like it's just their way of compensating their bottom line for cheap fares. We have learned there is inexpensive and their is cheap. Swoop is the latter.

### "definitely not a good deal"
Hamilton to Edmonton. I have flown my daughter and new baby grandchild every three weeks too and from Edmonton- Hamilton for the last 5 months. I have checked in for my daughter a total of 11 times. I must say I am extremely frustrated and dissatisfied with this airline, service and how they operate. For the past 5 months, the price to check in one bag has changed on every flight, there is no consistency. I asked staff why does the price change on every flight, their response was that there hasn’t been a price changed in one Year. Would you like to see my receipts. Today was $50.85 to check one bag, it was the same for a carry on. On todays flight the seat price increased to $34. Added, when my daughter went to the airport the staff demanded a $38 for her stroller. This is the same stroller that has flown back and forth across the country 11 times without extra charge. When she first started flying with swoop in October 2 infant items were allowed, then 1 item and now no items. I would love to know how and why and Airline can change its guidelines every week, I do not know of any other airline that does this. The cheap flight of $75 is now $200 for one way, definitely not a good deal! Added the wifi doesn’t work after payment is made. On todays flight the staff did not go through safety protocols for carry an infant on lap. I tried to call customer service today and after being on hold for 1 hour 21 minutes i finally spoke to someone. Of course, I didn’t get any resolution as the staff are following orders from above!

### "$80 is ridiculous"
Not Verified |  Halifax to Hamilton. I have flown with swoop many times now and I've never had any problems with their staff. They are always friendly and happy to help. I am not however happy with how much they charge for a checked bag. $80 is ridiculous. Everything else I am happy with.

### "charge for everything"
Not Verified |  Swoop is budget airline and it is just that. Budget. Very cheap fares but they will gouge every last dollar out of you if you are not careful. I would definitely recommend for maybe solo travelers or travelers who can traveling with only a small carry on. I think a family trying to save a few dollars should be careful or the cost of travel could double pretty quick. They charge for everything. I was almost shocked they did not have a coin operated bathroom aboard. Staff was great. Planes were clean. Overages on luggage are high so maybe leave the suit case at home and pack a large duffle bag so you are not paying for the weight of a heavy suit case.

### "a very pleasant flight"
Not Verified |  Our flight was WO604 and I must say that the flight to Mazatlan and return was great. Staff were very good and efficient. It was a very pleasant flight both ways. I would not hesitate to fly Swoop again.

### "Would not recommend"
We flew Hamilton to Las Vegas Feb 22 and had no issue with our personal item which is a small suitcase. No extra charge, fit perfectly under the seat and the flight was amazing. Crew was great! We arrive at the Las Vegas airport to check in with all our same luggage as we arrived with. At the check in counter we were asked to put a tag on our personal item and pay $55 for it as she has now classified it as a carry on. I explained to her that we left Hamilton with the same airline on Feb 22 and did not pay for the personal bag and was not going to pay going back home. Her co-worker quickly stepped in and said too bad about what happened in Hamilton, that if we wanted to take it home with us we were paying. The service from these 2 individuals was horrible, Swoop obviously does not have consistent processes for all locations and I would suggest paying a few dollars more to avoid the frustration. I emailed Swoop but no response. Trying to get in touch with anyone is almost impossible. They quickly take your money but dont want to deal with any issues afterwards. Would not recommend.

### "crew were very friendly"
Abbotsford to Puerto Vallarta return. The flight was (by far) the cheapest I have ever booked. In fact, even the couple of beers I had on the plane on the way to Mexico were half the price they were charging in the airport lounge in Abby! I admit the comfort level is not exactly first class, but neither is the price, and I expected that before flying. I’m tall (6’1”), but I survived. Honestly, the only slight downer was the lack of any real food on the plane. Chips and candy bars are pretty much all you’ll get, but really, who the heck wants to eat on a plane? The flight was smooth, on time both ways, the crew were very friendly, and really all was great.

### "The price is great"
Not Verified |  Hamilton to Abbotsford. The price is great and generally we have to pay for checked luggage anyhow so I had no problem with that. Many friends and family flew to a family wedding by way of Swoop this past summer and we heard no complaints. My flights have been pretty much on time and I think we all have experienced delays with flying from time to time. You have the option of buying a seat with more leg room. The Swoop app works well and I can watch tv and movies just like on any other airline and buy a drink or small snack. As far as I am concerned the big difference is price and that is a huge bonus especially if you buy their seat sales. Great sales every Friday and I am very grateful for Swoop!

### "They will not refund"
Puerto Vallarta to Hamilton. Left in Puerto Vallarta. On my ticket they printed when I checked in it says gate 18, boarding 12:05. Was shopping but kept looking to see if they were boarding and watching TVs and listening to pa system to announce. None of these ever happened. At 12:30 I went to see what was going on they changed the gate to B9. I got to b9 on time to watch them closing door and detaching. They will not refund this flight.

### "If you want more, pay more"
The trip was great. I arrived 3 hrs early in Hamilton. Service was great, helpful. Can't complain at all. I didn't buy anything on the plane but the attendants were great, funny, helpful, etc. Inflight entertainment had some bugs and interface was a bit dated but I just watched videos on my phone. Wifi is very expensive, which I guess is understandable. Seats were very basic, ok comfort but I had enough room (only 5'6" tho). The flight did leave an hour late so that sucked. Same thing from Orlando. A lot more ppl in airport but service was just as good. Again, a bit more than an hr late to depart. I don't get the low ratings and very pissed off reviews etc. That wasn't our (family 2 adults, 2 kids 8&11) experience at all. I would definitely fly again. Its a low cost airline, don't expect more than that. If you want more, pay more.

### "worst customer service"
Hamilton to Halifax. I would not recommend taking Swoop Airlines. They left my wife, myself and our 4 year old little boy stranded in the Halifax airport on Wednesday. We ended up being 3 hours early for our flight and would not let us on because our app didn't work to check in. They just told us to call customer service, which puts you on hold for 6 hours. I fly often and this was one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever dealt with from any company. I have tried contacting them many times and nobody will respond! Avoid this airline at all cost.

### "overall great flight"
Not Verified |  
We used swoop for our vacation to Vegas February 27-March 3 I was a little nervous after reading all the bad reviews but we had a great experience. I knew going in that everything was an extra cost including water. We prepaid for baggage online when we booked our flight to save money. We didn’t bring carry on just a personal item which was a small back pack. Leaving Edmonton our flight was right on time flight crew was amazing. Just overall great flight. Coming home we were delayed in Vegas for one hour we got a email well in advance so we weren’t sitting at the airport. The staff worked quickly and get everyone on board as quick as possible and another great flight back home.

### "I had a great experience"
Hamilton to Orlando. I read a lot of reviews about Swoop before I flew and I was convinced I had made an error in booking my ticket, but I realized that this is a case of people only reporting bad news! My check-in was seamless, the staff were great, the flight left bang on time, the plane was modern and clean, the flight crew were excellent, my seat was roomy, my bags were not lost and I had a great experience. Do not despair, Swoop is not as bad as people make out.

### "definitely fly them again."
Hamilton to Las Vegas. After reading reviews let's just say I was worried about flying with Swoop. My experience with Swoop was wonderful. I have no complaints and I will definitely fly them again.

### "never fly with Swoop again"
Not Verified |  I have flown round trip Edmonton to Hamilton 3 times, and this will be my last. My flight was changed and when I went online to select a new date and time the website would not work. I was then on hold with the Swoop call centre for over 2 hours while waiting to speak to an agent. When I was finally connected to an agent she was rude and unconcerned. No compensation of any kind was offered for the inconvenience. I will never fly with Swoop again.

### "worst airline ever"
Toronto to Winnipeg. This is the worst airline ever, everything is extra $, and if they select a seat for you it’s the last row in the plane, even a coffee is over 2 dollars, I had to pay 45 bucks for a carry on for 1 way, seats are very narrow, and they always delay and or cancel their flights. So if you wanna waste your money you may waste it elsewhere, unless you can afford to rent hotel rooms and pay for food for a couple of days more then you had planned, never book flights with this airline for an event you wanna attend the day before the event, plus with all the extras you have to pay,it costs the same as a real airline. I don’t understand why this company runs off of WestJet cause WestJet is a million times better. They deceive people with the “LOW” cost flights, cause at the end they charge much more then the “LOW” number you see when you search a flight, for example I booked a flight from Toronto to Winnipeg, round trip, and I got a just over 100 number on the screen at first and when I purchased it with 1 carry on both ways I ended up paying 400, but on my way back they kept delaying then eventually canceling and gave me a new flight for a few days later, so I ended up buying another ticket with a different airline and paid almost 500 for it but they kept their word and I GOT home,

### "very timely, friendly service"
Not Verified |  Was very anxious flying because the reviews didn't look promising, but it was great. I flew direct from Abbotsford to Mazatlan, flights were both very timely, friendly service, and quick. Airports were super quick to check through security, and small airports were easy to navigate. Great price, but it is budget - pick your seats on the emergency exit seats for a good amount of leg room, otherwise it will be cramped if you have long legs. So worth it for the price and no layovers.

### "currently stuck in Edmonton"
Not Verified |  These people are extremely undependable. They seem to have problems filling their planes so they keep postponing flights until the plane is filled. If you are on any kind of a schedule do not fly with Swoop. I'm currently stuck in Edmonton having suffered two flight cancellations. I am currently over 24 hours late getting back to my job and I am now promised the flight will leave this evening, over 36 hours late so far.

### "Awful experience"
Abbotsford to Hamilton. Awful experience. Who flies with no carry-on or bag at all? There’s an extra $80. Round trip Hamilton to Abbotsford was $700 - inflated to be just below other airlines. As a 5 hour flight, I wanted a cup of juice and was confused when she handed me the credit card machine. The return was incredibly delayed. After the departure time is when anyone bothered to tell the waiting passengers we were delayed. Even then, there were no details or ETA. The board didn’t even change from ‘on time’ to ‘delayed’ until after the departure time. I’m sitting in the airport now, our new departure time is 10:45 - it’s 10:35 and boarding hasn’t even started. We’ve received no updates since the first and only “we’re delayed”. I wouldn’t trust my travel with Swoop again.

### "never book this airline again"
Abbotsford to Hamilton. The flight got canceled a few hours before we were supposed to take off. The email which got send showed that it was canceled due to crew shortage. When we arrived at the airport we got told that the pilot was sick. That is the most unprofessional thing I have ever heard in my life. They offered a flight for the next day at 10 PM which we refused to take as we only had the trip booked for the long weekend, we would have arrived Monday morning at 5 AM and fly out again Tuesday, which was senseless. Because I was to trustworthy with the most ignorant and unprofessional airline I have ever dealt with I am stuck now with over $900.00 in hotel costs and we were unable to attend our family reunion. I have send complaints to swoop directly and asked for a fair refund of hotel cost without even getting a reply back. I emailed and I have tried calling them. When we drove home on the day the flight got cancelled, February 16, I was held on the phone for over 3 hours and then all of the sudden I got cut off and a voicemail was saying that I have called after hours and the office is now closed. I am so upset about all the ignorance we have experienced until now. I will never book with this airline again!

### "Will never ever book with Swoop again"
This was the worst flight experience I have ever had with any airline. Flying to Edmonton our flight was already delayed well over an hour. Coming back to Hamilton was a complete nightmare. Around 5:30pm we were notified that our flight was delayed an hour due to inclement weather. This didn't make much sense as the weather in both Edmonton and Hamilton were fine that day, and other flights were leaving as scheduled. The flight was then delayed until 3am, so we were stuck in the Edmonton airport for over 3 hours. Everywhere in the airport, including lounges, closed at midnight, so nobody was able to eat anything or rest anywhere other than the gate where you could hear very loud construction sounds. Again at the check-in desk we asked why the plane was so delayed and they said that there was freezing rain in Hamilton and the crew was coming from Hamilton. Every other flight leaving and arriving to Hamilton was on time, it was only our flight so it couldn't have been due to the weather. If you want to call Swoop's customer service, they will charge you $15 and are only available until 6pm MDT. The departure time was then again pushed back until 3:15am, but the plane didn't take off until 4am. This entire time there was absolutely no accommodations made for any of the guests, and there was the smallest brief apology stated by one of the flight attendants for having the plane be so late. Everyone on the plane was absolutely starving, but of course you can't eat anything on a Swoop flight unless you pay for it. It's also not even that much cheaper considering the fact that a check in bag is $50 and carry on can be between $35-50 as well. Will never ever book with Swoop again.

### "worst airline I have flown"
Not Verified |  Hamilton to Tampa. Swoop was the worst airline I have flown with. They were dishonest with us about the updates with the aircraft, and made us wait hours before letting us know that the flight was cancelled. After the whole incident, I talked to one of the Swoop employees and she told me that they noticed an issue on the previous flight and once it landed they deemed it unsafe to fly. Kind of concerning that Swoop noticed an issue with a full flight of people and did not land the plane early but the problem was so severe that the next flight had to be cancelled. The next morning our new flight time was scheduled, and they had us board and sit for over an hour before they moved for no reason (giving us no updates) making us leave late for the second time in a row. They are not only unprofessional, but unprepared. Swoop is a new airline and it definitely shows. I will never fly with them again and would rather spend hundreds more to have a reliable flight. My boyfriend and I lost nearly $400 by missing the first night of our vacation, but rather than getting compensation for the missed reservation, Swoop gave us a $30 food voucher. Please don’t fly with this airline and save yourselves the headache.

### "an absolute nightmare"
Hamilton to Banff via Edmonton. After driving all night from Rochester, NY to get to the Hamilton airport in time for our 5:45 AM flight on Valentine's Day, we got to the airport to find that our flight had been cancelled due to "Crew Rest" and rescheduled for 24 hours later. So, after traveling all night, they wanted us to get up at the crack of dawn the next morning to make another flight that would surely be delayed again anyway, to be in Banff for 24 hours and turn around to fly right back on an overnight flight. We decided it wouldn't be worth the trip to be in our final destination for 24 hours, not to mention the exhaustion from numerous days in a row of overnight travel. The workers at the counter promised flight refunds if we called the number or emailed their help desk. It's been over a week and I have to yet to hear back from either, along with numerous attempts to get in contact via Facebook. 4 flights, 3 wasted vacation days and a non-refundable airbnb later, I'm out $700 USD and have yet to hear back on whether I'll be refunded or not. This whole experience has been an absolute nightmare. Do yourself a favor and stay away from Swoop and their parent company Westjet while you're at it.

### "sort out their communications"
Hamilton to Halifax. 6 hour delay in our 6:20PM flight with no warning. A simple miss from Swoop was that we only received the notification at 5PM (as we were clearing Security). Delays happen, not a big deal, but on this night I was travelling with my wife and 13-month old boy (so we've got the added stress of trying to keep a little guy happy and not drive everyone in the terminal nuts). No one could tell us what was going on or what our options were. Tried the client services number as well and waited on hold until we just coudn`t wait any longer Decided it was too much to put the little guy through as we likely wouldn`t arrive at our destination until close to 5AM the next morning - so we left the airport and back home - effectively cancelling our Family Day Vacation. Swoop however did turn this bad situation into a more positive one. I did have to wait 1 hour and 33 minutes on hold today (Tuesday after the Family Day long weeked), but they did refund me the entire air fare and also offered to refund me any incidentals (parking, meals, etc). I wasn`t expecting that. I`ll try them again - but hope that they can sort out their communications with their customers.

### "avoid this airline at all costs"
Worst experience I've had on a plane. Delayed flight for over 8 hrs due to a pilot being sick. After reading reviews seems to be a standard excuse they use. They told us 50 minutes before the flight and the delayed it multiple times throughout the night. The ladies at the counter are completely at the mercy of head office and had no information. I unfortunately booked the wrong day back for my return flights, and only noticed the day before. My mistake but trying to charge me 15 dollars to even speak to someone on the phone is ridiculous. I refused to call/pay out of principle and I booked a Porter flight in 10 minutes instead and beat my buddies back to Toronto because Swoop delayed the return flight. Just avoid this airline at all costs.

### "wrecked my family plans"
Halifax to Hamilton. I actually like Swoop when there are no delays, but, out of the last five flights I've only experienced one flight without a delay. Today, my flight was supposed to depart at 1230p but it was delayed to 755p. Not surprised and it really wrecked my family plans.

### "Very rude and arrogant staff"
Flew Edmonton to Winnipeg with Swoop. Worst experience. Worst customer service. Very rude and arrogant staff. Not a people person at all. Have training to how to talk and respect people. Not loved at all. Not recommend for people who expecting good respect if you giving respect.

### "cancelled the flight"
Hamilton to Abbotsford. Horrible Experience. They cancelled the flight just 3 hours before departure. And relocated us in a flight 2 days after. I lost 2 good days of my vacation just due to lack of their crew resource! When I wanted to cancel both my flights, they said they can refund my outgoing flight but can't refund the return flight. If I can't even go, how am I supposed to return. Tried them first time because of their price and learnt my lesson in the hard way. Never ever buying swoop again. Expected better service from a WestJet subsidiary.

### "Horrible experience with Swoop"
Hamilton to Tampa. Horrible experience with Swoop. We fly at least 4 times per year and would never consider this airline for family travel ever again. They have one check in agent for 2 or 3 flights and they just delay your flight without warning indefinitely after scrambling to get you through. I would believe the online reviews of this airline. I am usually pessimistic but it is just as fast driving to your destination, with less stress. Horrible airline I hope Transportation Canada eventually shuts down.

### "communication about delays was unacceptable"
On February 2 I flew out to B.C. on a flight with Swoop to visit my daughter. Had a great flight out to B.C. However, my return to Hamilton on February 6, 2019, was a different story. Ontario was dealing with an ice storm. At 6:30 am I received an email from Swoop that I could cancel my flight, due to the inclement weather. I would receive a complete refund, provided that I sent an email to Swoop. Unfortunately, I decided to be pro active, and cancelled my flight home to Ontario, even though they did not mention that the flight was cancelled or delayed. Thirty minutes later, I realized that the flight back to Ontario was still on schedule. I decided to rebook on the same plane to Hamilton. I was shocked to see that the price had doubled to $449.00 for a one- way ticket (WO106). However, I booked a new seat on the same plane. I rushed to the Abbotsford Airport, and tried to explain to the Swoop attendant that I wanted to cancel the new booking, and keep my original booking for the same flight. The attendant was on the phone for quite awhile, explaining the situation, and she confirmed that I was back on my original plan and that the airline was refunding the $512.00 onto my credit card for the one- way ticket home. I was given a boarding pass, and everything was good. Once through security it was announced at the airport that the plane was delayed 5 hours. Because we were landing in Ontario after 10 pm, I decided to book a night at the Super 8 at $145.77. Finally, we were called to board the plane around 3:00 pm. (original flight time was 10:20 am). Just before take off, an attendant called out my name, and ordered me OFF the plane! I was travelling alone, confused and devastated! The attendant went to the computer and noticed that I was cancelled off of both bookings.The attendant admitted to Swoop’s mistake  and the best they could offer was a booking on the next plane with $100.00 off the new price of $449.00. Unfortunately, the next plane back to Hamilton was on Thursday, February 7 at 10:00 pm, landing on Friday, February 8 at 5:30 AM! I was scheduled to work on Friday! I then decided to find a flight on WestJet that would get me home on Thursday, February 7. The entire trip home cost me an extra $663.02 because of Westjet's one way flight cost ($598.30), another night at a hotel ($136.82), no refund on the cancelled Super 8 Hotel ($145.77), and cab fares,etc. The emotional distress to me because of Swoop's error was huge. Travelling alone, without my luggage, far away from home, was the worst day I had experienced in a very long time. I know the risk in travelling during the winter months, but the communication within Swoop about delays, was unacceptable. They knew that the flight to Ontario was delayed, yet waited until I was sitting in the airport, already checked in, to announce it? I would have never cancelled my original flight, if I knew that it might not be cancelled? Even though I enjoyed the lower cost of flight and the convenience of a direct flight to B.C., I was devastated by the experience getting home. I have learned not to cancel a flight, even when given the choice. If Swoop had just refunded me for one return flight and not both flights, I would have been happy with their airline!

### "Air Canada, here I come"
Don’t book this airline and save yourself a disappointing experience and money. Drove to airport to find out the flight was canceled because the pilot is sick (maybe a standard excuse, but where is the backup or do they only have one pilot), email arrived after we were at the airport so we could have saved that trip too. The ladies at the counters seemed to be very experienced in telling people that flights are cancelled and they could offer a different flight (two days later) or we could get a full refund. We asked for the refund and left the airport, had to cancel our hotel in Toronto (not fully refunded of course) just to get an confirmation email that we are now booked on the flight two days later. I wonder if they do this intentionally, spend over 90 minutes to get hold of an agent to get our refund. Now we have to wait to see if we actually get our money back. I think Westjet needs to take their concept back to the drawing board, until then, I cancelled my Westjet credit card and will hold off using them and for sure never book Swoop again. Air Canada, here I come.

### "Not at all impressed"
Hamilton to Vancouver. Not at all impressed with Swoop. We arrived an hour before the flight and found out when we got here that the flight was cancelled due to a shortage of staff. We waited for 2 hours in line hoping to get a refund but then gave up and decided to call them from home instead. The mass of people in line to get refunds was confusing for people trying to get into other flights, who ended up waiting in our refund line unnecessarily for 1.5 hours before realizing they were in the wrong line.

### "Plane is not comfortable"
Not Verified |  Edmonton to Las Vegas. Not going to fly with swoop ever again. Delayed flights and lack of communication. Plane is not comfortable at all, seat barely reclines, no leg room. How hard is it to give out water for free?? 3$ for a water is a joke. Flight attendants seemed like it was their first day on the job

### "my worst travel experience"
Abbotsford to Hamilton. Swoop has been my worst travel experience by far. They are consistently poor across the board. Flights delayed. I am currently sitting on the tarmac waiting for 15 minutes already at my final destination, we are an hour late and now the captain has informed us that it will be another 25 minutes before we are able to start de-boarding. Further, the planes do not even attempt the appearance of cleanliness. There was food all over the seats and floor when I first boarded. Charging panels did not work the entire 5 hour flight and of course on this flights your personal devises are you only entertainment. WIFI did not work even with their app. You have to pay for water, and forget about canceling even we’ll in advance. I paid $250 (for a deal advertised at $99 by the way) and when I had to cancel it for unforeseen circumstances there was a $100 cancellation fee, plus they will not return the money you paid for your seat selection($36) OR carry-on bags ($40). When asked why they said that it was due to the fact that they had “prepared the baggage staff to load my bag”. So in the end I was “refunded” $54 to a swoop account that I must use in 90 Day! I give Swoop 1 out of 10 only because the staff although fairly unhelpful were friendly enough and it won’t let me rate 0/10. This airline seems like a cheap good option. It is not! Do whatever makes you happy.

### "I missed my flight"
Not Verified |  Edmonton to Hamilton. Simply horrible. I went to check-in online about 50 minutes before my flight, and got the message back that "Your flight has been cancelled; please call customer service or visit a desk agent". Thinking that meant that my flight was cancelled, I sat at a cafe in the airport and called customer service because I figured the airline desk line would be long. After half an hour of waiting I decided to try my luck at the line and found out that my flight was not cancelled, but that's just what it says when you try and check in online past the time that online check-in is allowed. So I missed my flight, and according to customer service that's my fault. Now sitting at 1h30 on the phone with "customer service". Just fly with Flair, they were way better.

### "Delayed 18 hours"
Swoop and WestJet, it's not me it's you and we have to break-up. Terrible experience flying in and out of Edmonton with delayed flights. Delayed 18 hours on Monday, flew home at 3am on Tuesday and to them, this was completely acceptable. Spoke to a customer service agent today regarding compensation and like usual was told it was due to weather and therefore they are not obligated to do anything for me. Can they prove it was weather, nope of course not and they are not held accountable to do so. Over $100 in compensation that I asked for due to extra car rental and meals you have lost a customer for life. You were the only airline I have used for the last 12 years but the bitter taste of low cost and poor service will remain long past the extra money I will spend elsewhere.

### "Unimpressed, completely"
Hamilton to Halifax. Flown with swoop for 4 flights. First 2 ok, however 3 out of my four flights have been delayed over an hour. First delay - Tampa to Hamilton - no flight crew! They were coming off of another flight -sure, fine, but tell us so we can at least go get something to eat! Especially since the menu is super limited on the plane. Last 2 flights not impressed! Had to pay for carry on following rules - however it appears they don't apply to all. First flight Hamilton to Halifax delayed by over 3 hours! Unimpressed. Not offered so much as a meal voucher - also travelling with my 9 month old by myself! Attempted to contact customer service to no avail. Flight returning Halifax to Hamilton, stuck in airport waiting, over 2 hours delayed and ended up having to get a hotel in Hamilton for the night as it was unsafe to drive after being up since 6am and landing at 3am. Once again, contacted customer service with zero response. Sure the cost of the ticket was fine, but it cost almost as much just to have a carry on each way plus $170 extra for a room so I wouldn't crash my car/kill myself and others plus meals due to flight delay. Unimpressed, completely.

### "great experience with Swoop"
Hamilton to Abbotsford. Great flight, terrible weather, we were shocked plane was able to fly out. A short 40min delay then he took off, no issues at all. Great take off and landing, flight was very smooth. Service great, this is my 4th flight on swoop all have been great. Only issue was a weather delay flight from Abby to Hamilton, the plane didn’t arrive because of weather. We weren’t notified until we arrived at airport. The delay was 5hrs so we should have been notified the plane hadn’t left Hamilton so we didn’t drive all the way, only to return 5hrs later. Otherwise great experience with Swoop.

### "I am beyond disappointed"
Winnipeg to Edmonton, WO505 on 11th February. I am beyond disappointed in the service we received with Swoop. We have been delayed 4 times. 1 departing and an extreme amount getting home. This has been an extreme inconvenience. I will miss a family funeral and my husband is missing appointments that cannot be rebooked for a long time, not to mention we are flying with an 8 month old. This has caused more then enough anxiety the entire day awaiting the next delay.

### "they charge an arm and a leg"
Not Verified |  We saw how cheap the flights were and decided to give Swoop a try. The flights may be cheap, but they charge an arm and a leg for every other little thing. On the day of our flight home from Vegas we didn't receive a check in email which was weird, so we called the airline, where they inform you that they're going to charge you $15 to speak with someone. We were on hold for an hour and twenty minutes, and were then told that "someone" had cancelled our flights home. After a few more back and forth phone calls we managed to get on the flight home. We then tried to check our bag in online because it's cheaper to do so, but it wouldn't allow us to. So when we got to the airport we paid $50 for one bag. Our flight was also delayed from 5:55pm to 10:05pm. The flight attendants were rude and unprofessional. Westjet should be embarrassed by Swoop, as Westjet is probably the best we've ever flown with.

### "will not provide compensation"
Puerto Vallarta to Vancouver. Swoop cancels my flight due to weather related reasons at Abbotsford airport in February 9. They are now trying fly us out on February 11. This will not provide compensation. So passengers are stuck with paying for additional accommodations and losing out on a day of work. This totally negates going with a “discount” airline. Going from Abbotsford to PV was good. Crew was polite and professional.

### "well below my expectations"
Abbotsford to Puerto Vallarta. I just had my first and last Swoop experience. We were booked to go to Puerto vallarta this morning and they postponed the flight three times then finally cancelled the flight at 5pm due to very high winds that we were ok with and completely understand this was beyond their control. The check in staff had indicated the flight would likely leave the next morning and that we would get an email update. We went back to the customer check in and they apparently cant make changes and they told us to call customer service that works business hours and was not available. Thier customer service only works business hours Monday to Friday and a part day Saturday. I finally got the update via email and we now have a red eye that leaves at midnight Monday, 12 hours later than expected. I tried their customer service thinking I might find a way to get through to someone with no success. I tried to make changes online and they are experiencing technical difficulties. I have no way to revise our trip. I have never seen such poor customer service with an airline and I have traveled a lot for business over the years. Westjet should be ashamed on how poorly swoop their discount airline is handling customer service. I have yet to step onto a Swoop plane and they are well below my expectations.

### "Zero customer service"
Zero customer service! Flight Hamilton-Abbotsford cancelled this morning "because of weather issues". Sounds weird because flight from Toronto Pearson to Vancouver was flying, I'm pretty sure that they were under capacity, it was much profitable for them to cancel this flight and put us into another one. I came from 8 hours bus from Montreal and did not have a car I was almost stuck in the airport for the complete day. When I tried to get more info, the customer service agent laughed in my face and told me there is nothing they can do except to book me an other flight for tonight! I had a job interview today at 4pm at Vancouver and this screwed everything! A couple of passenger were nice enough to propose to drive me in town and even helped me to find an hotel because I don't know the area. They even came back later to give me a ride back to the airport (1h drive) but received another notice from Swoop that the evening flight will take off 2 hours later. This is my first mistake with you and I learnt my lesson. Next time I will flight with a real carrier and will read customers reviews before booking anything.

### "Cancelled flight for weather"
Hamilton to Abbottsford. Cancelled flight for "weather". Only airline to do so. Likely because the flight was under capacity. Will only rebook 7 days out max. App still let us check in this morning. Our hotel $ and hockey tickets for Vancouver. Counter agent in Hamilton laughed in my husband's face when he tried to check in. Nice!

### "Horrible experience"
Hamilton to Edmonton with Swoop. They cancelled our flight because they didn’t book a crew. They couldn’t get us onto the next fight so we had to wait 2 days and the people on the phone knew less information than the people at the desk. People on the phone don’t know anything and people at the desk can’t do anything. Horrible experience. I’ll spend a little more next time. And I would understand if it was weather but the lady at the desk let it slip that they don’t have a crew. Of course buddy on the phone said it was weather.

### "Extremely disappointed"
Las Vegas to Hamilton. Extremely disappointed with the service I received leaving Las Vegas on my way home to Toronto. The gentleman who was scanning tickets and passports as we were entering to get on the plane treated us so horribly that I will never use this airline again. My boyfriend had his things scanned, then was patiently waiting out of the way for me to get mine scanned. The man told my boyfriend that he cannot stand there in the rudest and nastiest tone possible. My boyfriend was not even on the way of anyone and was standing off to the side. There were literally 3 people behind us in line. This man basically forced him to board the plane without me. When my boyfriend kindly explained that he was simply just waiting for me for 2 second, the old man cut him off rudely and told him he had to leave regardless. I am disgusted and it honestly ruined my entire trip. I have anxiety on planes and am traumatized getting on them by myself. Having my boyfriend board without me was honestly a terrifying experience for me and was completely unnecessary.

### "Swoop is the one for us"
Not Verified |  Halifax to Hamilton. My wife and I have flown with Swoop 6 times and we have never had any of the negative experiences people are talking about. The flights left on time, they arrived on time, checking was fast and efficient,the planes were clean, their staff were friendly. My only comment is that if you are looking for an airline with frills at discount prices, this is not the one for you. If you are looking to get from Point A to B at a reasonable price, so far Swoop is the one for us.

### "would not refund or credit"
Edmonton to Abbotsford. Four of us decided to fly with Swoop for the first time. We had a health issue which we explained to swoop and they would not refund or credit (give us a 50 credit each only) our flights back and 5 days later we had four return flights and again would not return anything.

### "Worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Hamilton to Cancun. Worst customer service and corporate follow up imagineable The plane never got off the ground. After boarding, we were held onboard over 3 hours after we were otherwise ready to push back. This isn't clear violation to Swoop's tariff for international flights, which calls for taking passengers off the plane after 2 hours, and offering food and drink after 90 minutes. We were held on board over three hours and refused food and drink. This was after having the flight delayed for more than two hours earlier in the day because the crew needed rest. Ultimately, we are all pulled off the plane and had to wait another hour or so until somebody in Calgary decided whether or not to cancel the flight. Weather conditions ultimately led to the flight, and three other Swoop flights trying to leave Hamilton at the same time. Of course, none of us can control the weather, but an airline can control the customer service it offers its passengers. This is where Swoop failed so miserably. Swoop ground staff had no idea how to handle the situation in front of them effectively. They gave conflicting information. They behaved rudely. they clearly couldn't care less about the individuals involved and the impact it was having on them. Yes, people were upset, but their vacation plans had just been ruined. For the folks working at the airport, this is just their job. Provide customer service and do it well. Well, they didn't do that. on the plane, the flight crew advised us to contact swoops customer service department in Calgary. Of course, anybody who tried to do so immediately learned that Swift customer service in Calgary was closed. Since the cancellation, it has just been a continued serious of frustrations trying to contact and get any kind of satisfaction out of swoop. It might look like you're saving money when you see the Swoop price, but to my mind, it isn't worth the hassle. Don't let them ruin your vacation. I ended up flying on a different airline out of a different airport the morning following the Swoop disaster. Cost me a fortune since I live thousands of miles from Hamilton and had no way to get around easily. But it was worth knowing that I wouldn't have to put up with Swoop again.

### "a very good experience"
Not Verified |  Winnipeg to Edmonton. We have flown Swoop on two different occasions an both times have had a very good experience. Flights were on time maybe off 20 min one time but not a big deal . Customer service at check in was very good an quick as was boarding and on plane. The seats are leather instead of fabric which is much better /cleaner . No hidden fees all right there when you book online you choose if you wanna pay extras but don’t need to. Food an beverages for sale reasonable prices iand you can bring your own if you don’t want to purchase. We ended up sitting together without using the seat selection for the extra cost an could switch seats after take off if we chose as it wasn’t completely full . They also changed people around as it wasn’t full flight to balance out plane an gave everyone more room . All in all I rate swoop 9/10 very good experience.

### "missed flight by 30 minutes"
My birthday weekend trip to Vegas with friends and we missed our flight by 30 minutes they were unaccommodating and would not budge to help us. Refusing to rebook us or refund us anything. We asked to speak with a manager or somebody at a higher level and that is not an option! Very disappointed as this was my birthday present and we were meeting friends in Vegas!

### "declined my credit card"
Cancun to Hamilton. The airline’s website has declined my credit card (that I was checked with my bank was on and running and has been used the same day to make payments) to pay for my baggage not while checking in online as well as at the airport desk. I was told nothing has been done and I need to lose my bag as no other payment can be accepted. I had to ask a stranger at the airport to pay for me with his credit card as leaving my backpack in the foreign country was not an option. The flight has been over 2 hours delayed.

### "Overall super pleased"
Not Verified |  We got an an amazing deal flying out of Las Vegas to Hamilton, Ontario. Dec 23- dec31st 2018. One of those too good to be true deals, so I was really worried it was going to be a terrible flight. Turns out I was wrong! Flight there and back were probably two of the smoothest and most pleasant flying experiences ever! And we have a 3 year old and I was 32 weeks pregnant. I suppose there is a bit of luck to any flying experience. But both flights were on time and we boarded really fast. On the way to Canada it was a very empty flight, so they let everyone rearrange themselves once initial boarding was done and most people got a row to themselves. This was great since it was a red eye. They loved my little girl and gave her all kinds of free food. On the way back we got into our seats and one seat had a ‘do not occupy’ sign on it. So once boarding was over they moved us and they ended up bumping us up to premium economy! We just brought a backpack each and checked one bag. If you pay for your check bag in advance it is cheaper. I believe if you check it at the airport it’s $70 and only $50 if you do it in advance online. Overall super pleased, would fly with them again.

### "I am none too impressed"
Not Verified |  Hamilton to Edmonton. I have to say I am none too impressed. The flight is cheap but the it all begins. 1 bag $45.20 then its another $45.20 for a carry on, then it $14.00/seat whether you want it or not. Extra after extra, all befor you get on the flight. By the time your done you could have booked with a normal airline for the same cost.

### "worst customer service"
Abbotsford to Las Vegas. The prices is misleading , first they dont allow any Cabin bags and the ticket price doesnt include any Carry on bag and they charge too much for it ($70 for round trip 23K bag) , also they assign a middle seat only and if I need to change it to aisle or window seat I have to pay ($50 round trip ) even they dont allow you to change your seat at the check in counter even they have availability on the plane. It is the worst customer service and I will never fly with it again.

### "I needed to cancel it"
WestJet should be totally embarrassed about launching Swoop. I booked a flight and I needed to cancel it more than 24 hours before the flight time. I first tried to get hold of them and following the prompts I tried to sign in but apparently either my password or my email address was incorrect. After a couple of attempts I tried to reset my password. No reply. So I try again. I check my email again. No reply. I try a different email. I check my email again. Still no reply. So it's time to contact customer service. After about 20 minutes of trying to figure out their site and of course there's no email address and the phone number is not easily found. I see that they are not open at 5:30 p.m. on a Sunday. For the last couple of days I've been trying to contact them during business hours but of course they put me on hold for ridiculous periods of time. That seems to be their way of doing business. They take your money immediately no problem with that. Try to get some back and they just wear you down until you give up on it. They obviously don't want me as a customer so if they read this why don't you just give me some kind of a refund and I promise I will go away and never use you again. After all I tried Flair as well and they are very receptive even when I have a problem but it was more convenient for me to fly to Hamilton or so I thought. Big mistake using Swoop. Save yourself the frustration.

### "excellent, courteous, helpful"
Edmonton to Hamilton. I am a resident of Ontario but working in Edmonton. I have flown with Swoop Airline 3 times now on October 5, December 7 and December 28 round trips from Edmonton to Hamilton, all flights departed on-time and landed on-time or little earlier. The cabin crews were excellent, courteous, helpful. The check-in was quick and done online, the staff at check-in counters and  gates  also very helpful and courteous, the Swoop Apps is very good to enjoy the entertainment on flight. The only negative point is the too much charging on the carry-on and checked baggage. The leg room in economy is okay and not very good. I will fly with Swoop for the domestic and US destinations and will recommend to the family and friends.

### "What a joke"
Edmonton to Winnipeg. What a joke! Was supposed to leave around 9am, then delayed to noon and then to 4:35 pm. Loaded us around 4:50 pm and after about 20 minutes of being loaded they announce another delay because they are waiting for a replacement crew member because of rest time needed by the previous crew member. They had all day to figure this out and now at 5:38 pm, the replacement finally showed up. But they did offer us a small glass of water while we waited. People wanted to switch to empty seats while waiting and stewardesses said that they could not because they empty seats had extra leg room and that costs more. I finally heard an apology for the delay over the p.a. While she laughed that we will be leaving real shortly. Flair was scheduled to fly at 5pm (not delayed) and they boarded before us and will probably be there before we take off. 5:50pm finally closed plane door.

### "never fly with them again!"
We were flying from Abbotsford to Edmonton at 10 pm Thursday. Around 9:30pm we are told due to crosswinds plane can not land and has to go to Kelowna to refuel and will fly from there after refueling. Around midnight we are told our plane still hasn’t taken off from Kelowna and will let us know when it does. Around 12:30 am we are told our plane has finally taken off and we will be on our way in about an hour. Plane lands and we patiently await boarding our plane. Half hour into still waiting we finally hear that our flight has been rescheduled to tomorrow because the aircraft crew has worked their maximum hours for the day. There was so much anger amongst passengers. Everyone furious as to why we weren’t told of possibility of flight being cancelled when plane was in Kelowna. It could have saved hours of our time. It’s 2 am and We are told to go home and check email in morning for new flight time which ended up being 1pm and even that flight was delayed by another half hour. No one was reimbursed for any of the costs incurred due to ordeal(parking, cab fares, hotel costs...) I fly frequently on average of 10 x year for last 12 years and this was the worst experience I ever had. Major lack of communication and professionalism on how to handle the situation. Will never fly with them again! Will stick with Flair Air.

### "Excellent low-cost airline"
Hamilton to Abbotsford. Excellent low-cost airline, with everything expected. Flights on time, attendants courteous and professional, and business model saving me a lot of money. The allowance of the free person item is actually very generous.

### "No courtesies were given"
Abbotsford to Las Vegas. The plane was supposed to leave at 1:15pm ended up leaving after 7pm. We were only updated about the first delay after most people had arrived at the airport. The plane hit a coyote on the run way as it came in for a landing so that pushed the already delayed flight even further. No courtesies were given and updates were very rare. With the power out at the airport we were literally left in the dark.

### "Beyond frustrated with this airline"
Not Verified |  Winnipeg to Edmonton. Thought I would give Swoop a try and I must say I will never do that again. My flight has been delayed 7 hours and no reason why. It is not the weather for certain. Now this will totally screw up my car rental, hotel rental and driving plans when I get to Edmonton. I would love to simply cancel and get a refund so I can book another flight but that is not an option now. My suggestion for anyone planning to use this airline (WestJet company) to save yourself the aggravation unless you do not mind being delayed by hours upon hours and nickle and dimed for everything including a carry on. Beyond frustrated with this airline.

### "Tried it and hated it"
4 of us flew returning from Ft. Lauderdale, we all checked in at the same time. My son, his wife and my wife had seats in Row 8 and myself in 28. I explained it was our 25th anniversary and we'd appreciate sitting together. Yes she replied certainly $38. I asked why a family checking in would not sit together as most always do, she replied yes $38. I asked if the flight was full, she then looked at my carry on and said it was over sized another $38. I told her it fit in the cage, its a computer bag. She said to verify at the gate, the gate then said yes it fits and to see her again. As we all know impossible to go back, I called Swoop, $15 plus tax to speak to someone. Used the online and complaint denied. I disputed with VISA as services not rendered and charge was reversed. You can't always win Swoop. Now under a regulatory review and numerous complaints I'll go back to my other carrier. Tried it and hated it.

### "Poor customer service"
Abbotsford to Las Vegas. Flight was scheduled to board at 1:25 PM, did not board until 2:20pm. Making the flight an hour delayed with absolutely no announcement if the flight being delayed or why. Majority of customers waiting for flight extremely aggravated. Poor customer service, not worth the cheaper prices.

### "couldn’t have been happier"
We travelled between Tampa and Hamilton (return) over the Christmas holidays and while we were skeptical after reading all the negative online reviews we gave it a try as it’s so much more convenient to fly into Hamilton for us. We found the airline to be excellent! Both legs of the trip were pretty much on time (20 minutes delayed) and the flight staff were friendly and courteous. We seen people showing up at the airport with limited time to clear checkin and security and of course they were frustrated but that’s not the airlines fault! We couldn’t have been happier and would highly recommend but make sure you adhere to their recommendations arrive 2 hours ahead for international flights! !

### "full page of dark purple"
Edmonton to Abbotsford. Why would you force me to print a full page of dark purple when I print my boarding pass? Rather than have black text on a white background, you chose white text. Let's see, how can we make this visible? Well, let's put in a dark background that fill the entire page edge to edge. I had to print four of these monstrosities on my trip yet another hidden expense for Swoop. Ink is not cheap. Additionally, if you are going to email me my ticket, use an appropriate format. Not jpg. Please join the 21st century. We have phones that store our tickets if sent in the proper format. It does not cost anything. Please hire professional designers. Please think of the end user. There is more to a flight than simply flying.

### "poor customer service"
Just so I don’t get my blood pressure boiling again I’ll keep this simple. First time flying with Swoop (long time customer of WestJet) 1.5 pounds over on the luggage, charged $108 37,000 feet in the air, not allowed to switch to other open seats. Not much of a savings when they charge you for a cheap seat but get you on other fee’s last minute when your already in motion and don’t have a choice but to pay what they say. Thank you for adding on extra expenses, on Christmas Day nevertheless. Cold hearted, poor customer service. Good luck Swoop, hope your new inconsiderate company flies, no pun intended.

### "not allowed on the plan"
Edmonton to Abbotsford . Absolutely disgusted. I have flown with swoop any times, which in reality is a rip off since you have to pay for every single thing over top of the fare. My flight was at 7:45AM on December 27th in Edmonton, I have already checked into my flight the night before at 9PM and I had been running late to the airport due to my morning sickness, I had upgraded my seats to the front of the plane when I had checked in in case my morning sickness continued onto the flight. When I have arrived at the airport and gotten up to the counter to check my bag which I PAID for and get a hard copy of my check in tickets the women had denied me entrance of the plane because my baggage was going to make it when it was 6:55AM and my plane was departing at 7:45AM yes I was pushing it close and only had 5 minutes but the women beside me had said to the lady at her customer counter ‘you just made it ‘ Then after trying to find out my options with the lady at the check in desk, she had the nerve to ask why I was late, and I had then told her because I was having morning sickness, which then she had proceeded to say I was not allowed on the plane in general because I was sick. I have never been more disgusted and mistreated by an airplane ever in my life and when I had gone ahead and emailed them about it, and the women at the counter wrote on my profile that I was 13 mins late, that’s when I had walked away from the counter because she spend 13 minutes being rude. They also said I couldn’t wait to get on the 12PM flight because I was sick and it was going to cost me full price. Being nearly $800 dollars for my fiancé and I. So we rented a car from enterprise for $155 and $100 dollars in gas, drive back to BC! 12hrs later - thank you enterprise.

### "plane clean and spacious"
Hamilton to Abbotsford. The service I received at Swoop was beyond what I would expect for Canada’s discount carrier. Not only did I receive quick service with friendly staff, it did not take me long to board the plane. The flight was smooth and we got there just in time, if not just a few minutes earlier. Coming back home with fly swoop is the reason why, I’ll fly with them again. I sustain an injury while on vacation and the flight crew was beyond helpful and quick to ensure I was comfortable and able to enjoy my flight. Special thanks to the crew on board my return flight. Now back to the review, the plane is clean and spacious. Yes you have to pay for upgrades, but that’s what you would expect with a discount carrier. Honestly though, I feel you don’t require the extra leg space, I was very comfortable with the room I had. You have a chance to board the plane with food and beverages you can purchase at the food shops located in terminal, Also you can purchase drinks and food in the cabin, they accept visa and credit (visa debit, not sure) Flyswoop has given me the option to take mini vacations throughout my hectic work schedule and hope to see them expand in the North, maybe Anchorage, Whitehorse, or even Yellowknife. Also the South, Port of Spain, Santiago and more. They offered complimentary movies, that you watch on your own devices, this made the trip even quicker! This service is for the smart, trendy, cost savings individual, and everyone else who would rather spend more money on their vacation. Downfalls of flyswoop, they use a smaller international airports which is a bit of a distance to major cities - however, you can rent a car, or catch a bus for a reasonable price. Go Transit travels to Hamilton Go Station from Toronto and, their is a local bus that takes you directly to the airport for $3 Hope this review helps!! Their prices are amazing.

### "Overall great experience"
Edmonton to Hamilton. The staff was very welcoming and courteous. They had a smile and were very friendly and down to earth. The flight was even ahead of schedule and the flight was smooth. Overall great experience.

### "entirely unacceptable"
Hamilton to Tampa. There is no excuse for the way in which my flight was handled! It was supposed to depart Hamilton airport at 6 pm. We boarded at the appropriate time, but were forced to sit on the plane for over three hours while we waited for passengers from another flight to join us. When we arrived in Tampa, we were informed that we would have to stand in line to see a US customs agent, since there wasn’t one at Hamilton Airport. Swoop did not inform us about this before the flight. Because our flight was so late arriving, all but TWO customs officers had gone home. By the time our entire plane full of people was possessed, it was after midnight. The person who was waiting for me at Tampa Airport was given no information about our flight. Tonight, my son, whose ticket I paid for, is sitting on the tarmac on a flight that was scheduled to leave at 5:50pm. It is now 8:01 pm. This is entirely unacceptable!

### "try not to fly Swoop again"
Hamilton to Winnipeg. Will try not to fly Swoop again. Huge lines in small airport (Hamilton) and flight very delayed. I understand that happens sometimes so no big deal. On the flight I asked the flight attendants if the exit row had to be occupied and who would open the door in an emergency. They were very rude and short with me. They could have replied politely. Also very very little room on board.

### "went above and beyond"
Not Verified |  Swoop went above and beyond for our group of travelers. We had 1 flyer with a document issue, meaning she couldn’t fly. This was a 21st birthday trip for 2 of them. Swoop ground staff knew how emotional and upset we were and unbeknownst to us showed enough compassion to contact higher ups. They had no incentive to go to the extra trouble, as it was our issue and nothing to do with them. The other 4 of us could easily have still gone but they knew it wouldn’t have been the same. I dealt with an amazing rep who called me within an hr with some choices and what the company could do. At the end of an exhausting day I’m happy to say we will still be able to go together another time because of Swoop. And I will happily fly with them again and recommend others do as well.

### "I loved my entire experience"
I loved my entire experience with Swoop. I'm usually a very nervous flyer and have recently been prescribed animal therapy for my anxiety. I found the Emotional Support Animal policy on their website and went to my psychiatrist to get the letter they require. I emailed said letter to Swoop and they added it onto my booking information right away. We received priority boarding to get my dog settled and they were even able to give us our own aisle so that my dog could have her own seat. The flight attendants and employees at the counter were extremely friendly and helpful. The whole check in process was quick and easy. Not to mention the price was right! For myself, my boyfriend and 1 carry on (no charge for service animals), we only paid $175 or so! In December none the less.

### "Poor customer service"
Abbotsford to Edmonton. Good: New and clean plane Cheap flight. (Between 50%-70% cheaper) Bad: Flight delayed. Poor customer service. Employee unprofessional. Flight information not updated. Excessive bagages fees. Reduced leg room. Need to walk outside to get onboard the plane. No beverages provided. I won’t book with Swoop again. Poor experience. Ultra low cost airline with ultra low service.

### "they said you were late"
Their crew was not at the check in counter at Orlando on the flight back. They left me traveling with 2 children along with my wife stranded at Orlando airport. Customer service line took a long time to answer call like 2 hours after and they said you were late. They didn't refund a single penny. Their supervisor Brandon told me that we are educating our passengers by charging them. Completely horrible airline please avoid 100%. Not worth a hassle for saving max $150. I had to book a new flight on another airlines costed me an arm and a leg. Please avoid Swoop, I'm not sure how to sue them but I'll find out and do that.

### "not worth the savings"
Hamilton to Edmonton. Not worth the savings. Crew is lovely. But all the additional charges are ridiculous. I brought a small wheeled carry on. And my father who brought a larger duffel bag that was heavier was not charged and I was charged $40 each way for my bag. For $45 you can bring full size luggage and check it. Not to mention if you do not pay to select a seat you all get put in the back of the plane. The front half of our flight was 70% empty. Honestly not worth the savings.

### "Do not buy the WIFI"
Not Verified |  Abbotsford to Hamilton. Everything as expected, until I tried to use the WiFi. First page shows 3 hour pass for $8.99. Next page it has risen to $21.99 for thew full flight. FAQs says the bandwidth comparable to speed we are use to. Maybe if I was using a dial up. I can barely do email. Forget trying to download anything. In fact $21.99 plus tax wasted except for this review that I get to write. Do not buy the WIFI it is a joke. Buy a DVD and watch that instead.

### "shall never fly this airline again"
Hamilton to Abbostford. A horrible airline experience, first of all they have terrible Internet service on the plane I try to get a refund for it and they were not honour that because apparently data was used which i think is ridiculous when I have screenshots of no connection to the service. Scondly they damaged the bag that I had which was checked in one of the wheels are broken and side of the bag was bust and they gave me $50 voucher for maximum damage. I am unfortunately flying then return but i shall never fly this airline again.

### "So much miscommunication"
Hamilton to Edmonton. Checked online before leaving home at 3:40 am for a 5:45 am flight -it stated the flight was on time. Got to Hamilton airport and found out there was a delay till 8:20AM , then till 2:00 pm then 3pm. The swoop supervisor at the airport said we would be reimbursed for $30.00 each for meals d/t the delay. As well, when we checked our one suitcase- I was told to call Swoop central support to have them reimburse me for a carry on bag that I accidentally paid for but did not bring. We finally landed in Edmonton at 5:45PM 9 hr delay. When we called "Swoop Central Support" which we waited on the telephone for 48 min before someone answered - we told the agent we had 2 things to discuss. Reimbursement for my error in paying for an extra carry on bag - we were advised by the Swoop employee who checked us in to call central support and they would reimburse us for that error)- we were told by Central Support that this was not possible- I accidentally paid for a carry on bag for both flights - I asked if he could just cancel that bag for the return flight (as we were not leaving for a day) He said he would not bcancel the charge for the return flight. ($36.75) It was my fault for clicking that button and I agreed to the conditions so there was nothing he would do. I reminded him that the employee in Hamilton that checked us in told us to call this department and they would reimburse us as it was an accident. He said that the employees at the airport are contract workers and she was wrong to have told us that. After much discussion I asked to talk to a supervisor and he refused saying that Swoop does not transfer any calls to a manager/supervisor. He said if I had issues I could put a report into the Canadian Transportation Agency. During this same call we discussed the delay. The same employee started to explain that this delay was not due to Swoops fault- he said that it started on the Sat before the Tuesday flight with mechanical problems and a flight crew who had a ruptured ear drum etc, and that this is what put this flight behind. I asked him why they didn't change their computer check in status then because at 3:40 Tuesday AM the flight was still on time. I cut him off and I told him what the staff in Hamilton told us - it was delayed because the pilot came to work but was unable to fly and so they needed to find a pilot and fly him in and then the rest of the crew would be over there regulated time so they needed to fly them in. He stopped fighting with me then but then said that the $30.00 person coverage for food d/t the delay was only $10.00 per person. Once again I told him we had been told by Swoop staff in Hamilton that it was $30.00 person. He said they made a mistake at the airport for telling us this. So much miscommunication between airport staff and central support - awful customer service at Central support. It was uncalled for and not what you would expect from a new airline who is trying to get their wings wet. I hope a supervisor will read this review and contact me to discuss So much more to say not enough room Is it really true that you cannot talk to a supervisor at Swoop at "central support" ? If so, that will not help its Public Relations problem they already seem to have nor will it help it when you have arrogant staff answering phones.

### "thought I was missing my flight"
Edmonton to Abbotsford. The airline attendants made me run to my gate because they announced that the flight was all boarded and ready to go. I was so upset that I thought I was missing my flight even though I had 20 mins plus to get to my gate. Not good ways to get an aircraft boarded earlier. When I asked about the situation, the lady was very rude and just commented they wanted to get the flight loaded early. By scaring people into thinking they have missed their flight. I was running down the airport with another couple who thought the same. Not impressed with the staff (who were the ones announcing this) at the counter who were rude and didn’t care one bit.

### "Not worth the slight savings"
Edmonton to Las Vegas. Not worth the slight savings. All additional costs plus hassle at check in counter over what is a personal carry on item is too frustrating to do this again. One and done for me and the family with this airline.

### "not worth the hassle and inconvenience"
Swoop has terrible customer service. I was on hold for one hour and 16 minutes at which time I was told that nobody can help me. Very inflexible on any kind of change period, previous flight was delayed without any reason given. Will never use them again not worth the hassle and inconvenience.

### "found the trip to be seamless"
Hamilton to Las Vegas. Such mixed reviews online about Swoop I didn't know what to expect. Travellers: Me, my husband and our 3 year old. Bags: Personal item each plus a car seat and a stroller. I found the trip to be seamless. I checked in online but still went to the counter as we originally had our infant on the reservation but decided to leave him at home with Grandma. The check in attendant called the hotline and removed him from the reservation and even refunded me the tax associated with the infant. I was given 2 gate check tags for my car seat and stroller. Personal items were not measured or weighed but we clearly small. If they had wanted me to stuff it into the sizer, I would have had to finagle the backpack and bag in, but it would have fit. Priority boarding for those with small children, that was us. Also smooth. Once on the plane, you could put your jacket and bags in the overhead if you wanted. I brought my own snacks and water but we did buy stuff too. Credit only. There aren't a lot of food options but otherwise, prices are decent especially compared to airport prices to begin with. Online movies worked. Free (for a short while I think). You can also pay for internet. Deplaning was easy and my stroller and car seat were at the gate waiting. On the return, they let me check the car seat at the counter versus taking it to the gate. She put a fragile tag on it but it still came out with the rest of the car so that needs to be inspected, my car seat was folded and in a bag versus an 'open' car seat that was obviously a car seat. Seats are tight. I'm 5'7" and had just a few inches of leg room. Enough though for me. Full tray for eating and plug in available for every seat which is great. I'd fly on this airline again.

### "Seemed to get the run around"
Never again. Flight delay reason not given fully. Seemed to get the run around. Niw reading about issues in Halifax that same weekend I'm starting to think everyone was given some sort of run around. Two mechanical issues in Halifax and one in Orlando? Orlando issue is what affected our delay from Tampa to Hamilton. We were told it was a delay in Hamilton and not anything said about Orlando passengers now taking our flight because of their mechanical issues. Things didn't add up and still don't. Now I'm thinking everything is connected somehow. Never ever again with Swoop.

### "fly again with them happily"
Abbotsford to Hamilton. Service overall was very good. I did have to call in to make a change to my ticket but they were very helpful. The call centre wait time was a bit long at about 40 minutes but the person was very apologetic for the wait and helpful once connected. The flight itself was excellent, there were free movies on board through the Swoop app. You have to buy everything on board including water but what do you expect on a ULCC? The planes were nice and modern. I would fly again with them happily.

### "not be flying Swoop again"
Hamilton to Las Vegas. Has anyone taken Swoop recently without delays? I was told about this low fare new airline service out of Hamilton, Ontario. I am so disappointed right now as I sit at the airport waiting to board since 8am,  it is 10:10 pm still not boarded at. I get the fact that you have technical issues or even personal issues but this is unbelievable experience. I am sitting with my Dad who will be 86 on Dec 8th and my Mom who is 82. This birthday trip has not been a good start. I feel so bad for my parents right now. I feel like I was too cheap to buy Air Canada. We were suppose to be on board and departing at 10 am. So we arrived at 8 am from London, Ontario. It was delayed to 8:15 pm, 9:50 pm and now 10:50 pm. I have flown in many occasions but this is the worst experience ever! I will not be flying with Swoop ever again! This is not good. Their lack of communicate is so bad.

### "I missed my flight"
Hamilton to Abbotsford. I was recommended Swoop airlines by a friend and had the most horrible experience with their staff at the airport, the customer care helpline is the worse, I missed my flight for something that was not my fault, the customer care is non existent, they are understaffed and rude. I would be surprised if this airlines stays in business for the next 2 years. I would gladly pay my money to airlines that cares for their passengers and owns up to their mistakes.

### "both legs were all seated together"
Not Verified |  I have to start by stating that upon reading the previous reviews I was extremely worried about our upcoming flights. Both legs of our holiday had no issues and we have no complaints. We had a Edmonton/Winnipeg -Winnipeg/Edmonton flight booked. When you are prepared and follow the airlines rules and guidelines everything should be like no other airline. Staff from check-in to on-board were all very pleasant and accommodating. Plane was clean and a tad tinier that other flights but not unbearable. We prepaid for checked bags and added another for return with no issues. The Wi-Fi one direction was fine but returning had some issues. We had the app on our phone and checked in there but when we arrived at the airport the agent printed boarding passes for us saying that it is easier to scan than scrolling on phones for multiply tickets. We did not pre-book seats-we were a family of 4 and took the risk of a short flight not sitting with our teenagers, but on both legs were all seated together. The paid option of snacks is like other airlines in variety and prices. we chose to bring along coffee after security as it is a better cup of coffee than those traditionally offered on flights. Both flights left on time and actually landed a bit earlier that scheduled. I would highly recommend and will fly again.

### "the worst customer service ever"
Not Verified |  Swoop airline has got to have the worst customer service ever! I have been flying internationally for business for 20 years and have never experienced the unprofessional and immature service I am receiving trying to reschedule my flight. I paid for the insurance to have rescheduled, they lost my first reservation, just spent over an hour on hold today to reschedule, now it appears this one has been lost! What is the flight going to be like?

### "resolved many growing pains"
Abbotsford to Edmonton. No complaints. They seem to have acted on the earlier reviews and resolved many of the growing pains. A glass of water would be a nice touch though, it really wouldn't add much to the cost of overhead.

### "lack on customer service"
Orlando to Hamilton. Swoop has great prices on flights but that is because they lack on everything else especially customer service. I asked a few questions on Facebook and they replied within a day. But once I mentioned my luggage was damaged, they never opened my messages again. It's been 6 days. I've even tried to post on their most recent posts and I see them actively replying other people but me. There are many other posts with other people complaining about being on hold for over 2 hours and still not getting anyone on the other line. You're lucky if everything goes smoothly. But good luck to you if something is wrong because Swoop doesn't care.

### "website is horrible"
Not Verified |  Winnipeg to Hamilton. Prices are fair but their website is horrible. Never accepts CC payment and I always need to call and book in person. Then they make it seem like they are doing me a favour by not charging me the $15-  figure it out people. Tried contacting them but no response yet.

### "paid out of pocket for a hotel"
Not Verified |  My boyfriend and I flew from Hamilton to Halifax which was a wonderful flight. We were quite impressed considering the price we paid. But when we went to leave Ontario on on the 13th, we boarded on time, flew 2 hours to Halifax, wheels came down, you could see the runway, and then all of a sudden we were accelerating again and the plane was turned around due to weather. So we went back to Hamilton after a 4+ hour flight and were told that we had a flight again for the next day (14th) at 6:30pm. So after not being given anything (no food vouchers, no help for the hotels), we paid out of pocket for a hotel. Once we got there the next day, they delayed us 3 times to only cancel our flight at 9pm and reschedule us (another hotel) for today (15th) at 10:30pm. There was no help and there were many people who couldn't afford to leave the airport so people have literally been at the Hamilton airport since the 13th at lunchtime waiting for their flights with no help for food or comfort. In total, we have spent $577 on hotels and transport since Tuesday and that isn't including food.

### "great experience"
Not Verified | Hamilton to Abbotsford. This was my first time flying with Swoop, my husband and I flew with our 2 kids 16 months old and 2 months old. We had aisle seats beside each other which was great but difficult to tame our 16 month old. A lovely flight attendant came to our rescue, since the flight wasn't full she moved around a couple people and was able to get us a whole row to ourselves. Our son loved being able to sit in his own seat and had space to entertain him. She was always checking up on us to make sure everything was going well. She high fived our oldest any time she walked by. I will definitely be flying with Swoop again! Thank you for such a great experience

### "definitely fly with them again"
Hamilton to Tampa. Booking flight was easy, the flight was great. Will definitely fly with them again. Only issue was I didn’t book trip modification. My sister and I decided to stay one week longer and we tired to cancel our flight on the website, so if there were any credits after the cancellation fee we could use to book a flight the following week. We phoned before the 72 hour window and we were put on hold for over an hour. I also sent an email with our flight information stating that we wanted to cancel and rebook also attached my cell number. I received no reply. Currently been on hold on the phone again today. We just rebooked for the next week, and weren’t able to cancel our first flight. Hopefully they can get this issue with theirs phones fixed.

### "perfectly acceptable choice"
Edmonton to Abbotsford. Swoop airlines was a perfectly acceptable choice for this type of flight - short distance and low baggage. Reading the baggage rules carefully and following them is essential, but this airline does not try to hide their policies at all. There is a reason the flights are so affordable, and that's due to the strict rules and making customers pay for breaking them. All of the staff were very polite and welcoming in person, and the flight was as comfortable as a full plane can be. I would highly recommend Swoop airlines for a short duration flight, particularly if you do not need to bring any additional baggage. A very easy experience to walk on and walk off the plane with no problems whatsoever.

### "Not worth the price"
Edmonton to Winnipeg. Worst airline I have ever flown with. Ends up being an expensive flight with all the extra charges. The personal item has to be very small and the customer service is not great. Not worth the price! Very disappointed in WestJet.

### "Excellent service"
Not Verified |  Flew from Hamilton to Edmonton and return. Flight was great. Excellent service. Extremely affordable. Carry on fee is more than checked which was surprising. Easy to book and all pricing was the lowest available between other airlines. Definitely will travel again with this airline.

### "great budget no-frills airline"
Hamilton to Abbotsford. Swoop is a great budget no-frills airline. I think a lot of the negative reviews are people purchasing a cheap ticket and expecting a first class experience. Yes you pay for everything you want to add, you pay for drinks and food on board, but you don’t have to! I brought my own snacks and a water bottle which I filled up after security. I did carry on only and picked/paid for a seat with extra legroom and my experience was superb! Our flight wasn’t very full so the staff allowed folks to move seats if they wished which was nice. The flight attendants were lovely and attentive, pilots were professional and informative, and the counter check in staff were great and efficient. The plane was clean and I felt safe. I hope SWOOP stays around because I love not paying an arm and a leg to visit family around Canada! I will definitely fly SWOOP again and will recommend to friends and family. I also love that I can fly out of Hamilton, much less stressful than Pearson airport!

### "an excellent experience"
Abbotsford to Edmonton. We had an excellent experience. The staff were very friendly and professional. The check in was a breeze. All of our luggage was handled properly and arrived as expected. We had a delay and we felt the staff handled it really well. They explained the reason for the delay and kept us updated. I would highly recommend swoop and I’ll be flying with them again.

### "I do not recommend Swoop"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight that I needed to cancel. Because I could not find the information I needed to on the Swoop web page I contacted their customer service center by phone. I was on hold for over an hour and a half. I understood that I would not be able to get a full refund on my ticket, however, I believe I should have been able to have a refund or a credit with the $140 spent on baggage as they will no longer be on the flight or being handled. After talking with a number of people and having no help, I inquired about having one of my bags transferred to another traveler. This was also not able to happen. In short, I was very disappointed with my experience with Swoop and how they were not willing to work with their customer to come to a solution. I do not recommend Swoop at all. It may look like you will save money but in this experience I lost almost $300.

### "staff very friendly"
I flew out from Hamilton to Edmonton and back the next day. Both flights were on Swoop. I enjoyed both flights. The staff were very friendly and seemed happy to be on board. Will fly again.

### "Absolutely nothing wrong"
Abbotsford to Hamilton. Absolutely nothing wrong with my experience. Boarding was quick and take-off was as well. Smooth flying and landing. Used printed (at the airport) boarding passes on our way out of Abbotsford, then used my phone for my wife's and my boarding passes and had no issues when leaving Hamilton. Didn't pay for the in-flight entertainment, so I can't comment on that.

### "Excellent experience"
Hamilton to Orlando. Excellent experience with Swoop and Hamilton airport. So easy to park, no lines thru security, great waiting area, could use more vendors. Staff were all so friendly. Great play area for kids. Plane was like new, fun staff, left right in time. Very little choice to eat on board. Only negative Is that you clear US customs when u land, that was slow Would certainly fly Swoop and Hamilton.

### "both of our flights were excellent"
After booking our flights from Abbotsford to Edmonton and return I did a search online for Swoop. Well we were concerned about how our flight would be based on the reviews being mostly really negative. Well we are happy to say that both of our flights were excellent. Both were on time and we had excellent service from the staff at Abbotsford airport as well as Edmonton airport. We also had excellent service from every Swoop employee on both flights. The flight attendants were excellent. It is a shame that people will take the time to post negative comments online yet few will take the time to leave positive ones. It seems like many people sadly just take good service for granted. We have been dedicated WestJet customers for years and the only reason we are now using Swoop to go to Edmonton is that WestJet no longer flies to Edmonton direct from Abbotsford or vice versa. I think that many people are comparing Swoop to WestJet which also has amazing customer service. We need to realize that Swoop is new and if we think back to when WestJet first started up we will remember that WestJet had many issue when they first opened up. Look at how amazing WestJet turned out to be! Based on our two trips we are confident that Swoop will become as good as WestJet has and with time Swoop will work out some of the issues that are brought to their attention. Again from our two trips we have nothing but positive things to say about Swoop and their staff. Keep up the great work and please know there are many of us out here that think you are doing a great job and that we understand that with time you will even get better. People also need to keep in mind that there are somethings that no airline company has control of. Many of the negative comments on this site are about a flight out of Abbotsford that was delayed till the next day. People were upset that Swoop would not pay their 150 dollar hotel cost. They left out that the plane that was coming into Abbotsford from Edmonton was stuck by lightening and and was deemed to be unsafe to fly until a full inspection of the plane was done. Not putting in all the facts when doing a review is not right. Also we understand and feel for those that had to get hotels that missed their flights but to expect to have Swoop or any other airline pay for a 150 dollar a night hotel when the flight to Edmonton was 9 yes 9 dollars is unrealistic. 9 dollar to Edmonton and 26 dollars from Edmonton back to Abbotsord is unreal!

### "a good experience"
Hamilton to Orlando. I really enjoyed the convenience of flying from my city (Hamilton) to Orlando. I typically fly out of Buffalo to Orlando. Both flights however were delayed by about an hour & there was never any indication that there would be a delay. I flew economy & it was fine for me, but a taller & larger person would definitely need to book a seat with more room. The crew was very courteous. Overall, flying with Swoop was a good experience & for a short trip like this, I will book with them again.

### "expected decent customer service"
I am all for the low budget airline, and on board with no perks (no drink or food on flights, paying more for more desirable seating, paying for carry-ons) but I still would have expected decent customer service. I waited on hold for over an hour to discuss an issue I had that wasn't resolvable online (otherwise a $15 fee to call and talk to a person). I was informed of a Modifly program that they now have (probably because it is a terrible policy to not let people change their flights without losing all of their $). When I explained to the service agent, that had I known about the program I would have happily booked 14 days in advance and paid the extra $10 because I knew booking that my flight might change last minute, but that Swoop being a new airline, and this being a very different service than is typically available with airlines, and it not being advertized at all, I didn't know it was even an option. The service agent was very short and rude and basically told me to go write a bad review because there was nothing I could do about it. I honestly expected much better from an airline that is associated with WestJet.

### "definitely fly SWOOP again"
Winnipeg to Hamilton. We flew Swoop both ways for our trip. Our trip to Hamilton Oct. 18th was 1/2 hour late leaving. The passenger count wasn't working for them but I think they realized a child over 2 wasn't sitting in their seat for this process. It was remedied and we were on our way! The price was excellent especially if you book your luggage at the SAME time as your flight. They tell you this while booking online. Snacks are available on board for a fee payable only with credit card. We didn't use this feature. Our trip home was great. Friendly staff both for check in and on the flight. For only $11 we chose seats with a little more leg room at time of booking. We will definitely fly SWOOP again!

### "No customer service"
Not Verified | Not Verified | Edmonton to Las Vegas. No customer service. Booked flight to Vegas April 2019. Checked charges on Credit Card. Charged for Insurance $89.00 I opted out of. Tried to reach by phone. 47 minutes. 11 minutes. 1 Hour. 30 minutes. Friday Nov 2. No answer. On hold the entire time. Still no answer. WestJet should be ashamed to attatch their name to this circus of unprofessionalism.

### "staff very friendly"
Winnipeg to Edmonton. This is an amazing airline, staff very friendly, airline was on time and very organized. This is a discount airline, plan ahead if you want snack, pack smart, bring a reusable water container. I do not have anything negative to say about Swoop, I will be a frequent flyer now.

### "extra $90 for that luggage"
Very bad experience I booked my mom’s flight from Edmonton to Abbotsford The staff was really rude. As my mom don’t know English so she was yelling at my mom coz of the luggage which was ok at the boarding but extra when she was just about to get in the plane. The staff forced her to pay extra $90 for that luggage otherwise she is going to miss her flight. Very frustrated I called the customer service no apology from them.

### "can't go with my expired PR ID"
Worst airline ever. October 20, 2018 Winnipeg to Abbotsford I presented my PR ID (expired) and Mb health card and they didn't commented on it and let me in freely. Flight was delayed 6 hours due to foggy weather and washroom that need to be fixed. October 22, 2018 Flying back to Winnipeg from Abbotsford, I presented both my Id's and ticket and the staff told me I can't go in with my expired PR ID and I have my SIN # and Mb Health card for them them verify and those are the only ID's that I have and its the same documents that I presented on my flight going to Abbotsford with the same airlines (Swoop). They said its not their problem its not them who let me in and travel with expired PR. They are rude and they are not helpful at all. I run to get a fishing license as quick as I can. I was able to get a fishing license and arrived at the airport again 45mins before departure. The plane is still there we saw it. When I arrived at the checkin counter all swoop counter are cleared and they are all gone.

### "absolutely outrageous"
Edmonton to Winnipeg. We blew a tire on our rental on the way to airport.We told the woman at the front check in location we were in the airport before boarding was finished, we were helped and rushed through security we made it to the terminal at 749, 4 minutes after boarding still 11 minutes before flight departure. The attendant told me the door was already shut, and they would not let me and my family with a small child board. We are currently stuck in Edmonton looking for a ride  home with an 8 year old - this is absolutely outrageous.

### " I was forced to pay $90.40"
Hamilton to Edmonton. On my way from YHM to YEG, I had a personal bag, small enough to fit under the seat ahead of me. I was at the YHM airport and they gave me absolutely no issues with the bag size. And it did fit well perfectly under the seat with absolutely zero hazards. For my return flight, I had the same bag, same size as I did not add any additional products to the bag. The attendants were speaking to me with such degrading tone saying “if you can’t afford 90$, throw some stuff in the trash or leave your bag”. I never felt so embarrassed. I was forced to pay $90.40 as they gave me the ultimatum of missing my flight and being stuck in the airport or paying for the bag which would fit under the seat.

### "Zero customer service"
Scheduled flight from Abbotsford to Edmonton October 20 08:45 Email at 05:30 indicated a delay. Very foggy at airport. Apparently the aircraft flew back to Kelowna to wait out the fog. By 11:00 aircraft were beginning to land. Westjet, Flair etc. But not Swoop. P/A announcement from other airlines were courteous enough give updates on flight status but no a word from swoop. 5 hours later an announcement that the aircraft will arrive in 5 minutes! Almost 2 p.m. Now taxing. What a joke airline. Zero customer service. Stay away.

### "disregarded as a customer"
Edmonton to Abbotsford. This is the first time I've given a company 1, but when the agent recommends you book with a different company that speaks volumes about the company. Swoop did absolutely nothing but lie to us for our 6 hour delay for a flight that is only 1.5 hours long. We waited over 3 hours on the phone to speak with someone in regards to cancelling our flight. The service was horrible and they kept telling us there is nothing they can do and they are unable to help us. I get its a budget airline, I'm ok. Paying for every single thing but I'm not ok with being disregarded as a customer. Never will I fly with them again and I'm sorry to Westjet cause they were always so good to fly with but this will impact my decisions about westjet moving forward as well.

### "First and last experience"
Dreadful. First and last experience with Swoop. Hamilton staff; (no where to be found) left three parties stranded, with no ability to check in. One party was able to leave luggage with a family member (to be sent later), the other party and ourselves were not able to simply board the flight and leave our luggage, paid for in advance, by the way. One Swoop staff person was located by an airport employee, Her attitude was unbelievable, holding her smart phone up to my face telling me there was no one waiting at the counter, so 'we left to load the plane'. One of the other parties also took a picture (with a clock in view). We were there in excess of 45 minutes prior to the flight. The plane left without three of us, the Swoop employee said 'that was your choice', then sarcastically, said. thank you, have a nice day' as I walked away. No additional flights were available. Swoop made no effort to help us out. Air Canada (yes, Air Canada) searched area airports and all other carriers to try to help. We ended up having to rent a car and driving 22 hours straight to get to our destination.

### "cleanliness was an issue"
Hamilton to Edmonton. It’s nice to finally have an affordable airline to travel within Canada. I didn’t mind buying water on board, however cleanliness was an issue. When we boarded the aircraft the floor was very dirty, with food all over it, when I pointed it out she said we weren’t provided the vacuum service. I understand that many of the services were pulled back like beverages, snacks, legroom, chair recline to make the airline affordable, but not cleaning the aircraft shouldn’t be compromised. I will fly Swoop again, however if they don’t clean the aircraft I will have to reconsider, I would rather pay more than sit in flight for hours.

### "flight was delayed twice"
Not Verified | Terrible. On the way home, from Halifax to Hamilton, flight was delayed twice, then rescheduled for the next day at 8 am, then delayed again until 11am. I had other family heading back from Halifax 2 days later, and there flight was delayed aswell. They're a great airline to fly with, so long as you don't have average expectations, and you don't care if you're on time. Another thing that is extremely inconvenient is, there contact number that shows up on there website is directed to Calgary, and there office doesn't open until 8 am, mountain time. Depending on where you are in Canada, if you have a last minute emergency and you need to talk to a representative from Swoop, you're on your own. I'll pay the extra money, and fly with someone else next time.

### "I would recommend Swoop"
Halifax to Hamilton. Overall no complaints. Swoop is a very basic plane but for a two hour flight you don’t need all the extras and the price was great. Swoop pricing was the reason I was able to spend thanksgiving with my family. Flight was delayed because of weather but no one could change that. Swoop was good with updating us on the changes and what was to be done when we came back in the morning. Flight attendants were friendly and the flight was smooth. Overall I would recommend Swoop.

### "I'll choose Swoop again"
Edmonton to Abbotsford. Before the flight, I checked rating here, and was a bit afraid of the service quality and punctuality of flights at Swoop. But my experience explained everything. The aircraft is in a fairly new (well maintained) condition. Room between two rows is okay. By the way, I am 180cm tall. Each row has 6 seats. The seat on the aisle side is a bit narrow. The other ones are okey by size. I had a carry-on luggage with me. Unlike other sneaky cheap flight airlines I experienced in Europe, Swoop did not check the weight and dimension of my carry-on. Cabin crews are friendly. As a cheap flight airline, it is within my expectation that all beverages and food must be purchased. Wifi is available in cabin subject to payment. But for a one-hour flight, it really did not matter. Staff at the service counter at the airport were also friendly and helpful. For my next trips, I'll choose Swoop again.

### "unorganized and inconsiderate"
Halifax to Hamilton via Mississauga. Our flight was delayed twice before being canceled. Each change we received an email. We were not given any compensation for hotel or anything because the cancelation was due to weather. We were told to be at check in by 5am. Staff didn't show up until 5:25am. That is when we were told our 8am flight was delayed again until 11am so the crew could have the appropriate amount of rest. Again, no compensation offered and no email  notification was sent until 8:03am,  3 minutes after  our flight was supposed to have left! If I flew with Air Canada, I would have been able to switch to a Toronto flight, but Swoop doesn't fly there! Having had to fly for a funeral, this was an unexpected expense and I did not have any extra money to stay in a hotel. My family is 2 hours away from the airport, so it wasn't an option to stay with them, instead I half napped on a bench. This airline is very unorganized and inconsiderate to the people keeping them in business. I will not be flying Swoop again and recommend that you spend the extra couple of dollars to get a flight on a reputable airline.

### "not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Halifax to Hamilton. First time flying with Swoop, flight was delayed 12 hours and was promptly informed they will not accommodate any vouchers or hotel stays for anyone. Also, have to go pick up bags in hallway and re check in and new boarding passes the next morning. Will not fly with Swoop again and will not recommend this airline to anyone.

### "Very pleasurable trip"
Not Verified |  My husband and I flew with Swoop Hamilton to Edmonton and return. We will definitely fly this airline again!! No complaints at all. Entire staff, both ways, so very friendly and accommodating! Very pleasurable trip. Thank you

### "my experience was very positive"
I flew Swoop airlines from Hamilton to Abbottsford and back in October this year. If you want to rate Swoop airlines, you have to consider it to be a no-frills airline. Comparing it to Air Canada or Westjet is not appropriate, a more realistic comparison would be Ryanair. As a it is a no-frills airline, my experience was very positive. Customer service took exceptionally long to answer my call (about 45 minutes) but was able to resolve my issue within minutes afterwards. Hamilton and Abbottsford are small airports, therefore security was done in 10 minutes. Downside: no public transport whatsoever at Abbotsford, prepare to take a taxi to the city center or to be picked up by someone you know. Both flights were on time. The amenities on board are way better than Ryanair. In-seat power, in flight entertainment via wifi and movable neckrests were available at every seat. This is even comparable to Westjet and Air Canada and well beyond low cost carrier standard. However, recline was minimal, so sleeping was not quite possible in this upright position. If you bring a neck cushion it's okay. On board amenities for purchase were limited but reasonable priced. 3.99 for headphones or 4.99 for a bowl of ramen soup are fine in my opinion. Overall my experience was positive, especially if you consider the price. I'd definitely fly again.

### "good value for money spent"
Flew on Swoop Winnipeg to Abbotsford and return during the end of September. Both of the flights operated on time with no delays. The boarding was conducted quite smoothly, considering the Abbotsford airport security personnel were obviously overwhelmed with 3 flights leaving a small airport at the same time. The flight attendants were all pleasant and attentive in carrying out the limited in flight service. You pay for absolutely everything and the seating is tighter than other carriers. I pay extra to sit in the emergency exit row that has lots more legroom, so the smaller seat pitch does not apply. Also none of the seats will recline saving your knees. Overall Swoop is good value for the money spent and I will fly Swoop again.

### "Hardest landing experienced"
Edmonton to Abbotsford. They were over an hour late. Airplane used up most of the runway before taking off. Hardest landing I've ever experienced and to top of all off everyone was thrown forward at the end of the landing with excessive braking.

### "Very unprofessional Airline"
Very unprofessional Airline. Our group of 8 traveled from Edmonton to Abbotsford on September 13, 2018 and returning to Edmonton on September 16, 2018. On our return to Edmonton on September 16, 2018 the flight W0124 was canceled. It was rescheduled for Monday September 17, 2018 at 8:45AM - Flight W02224. Many upset passenger were advised that Swoop Airlines would not provide any accommodation, transportation or any food vouchers. As many other passengers we were very upset and frustrated, we rented a vehicle and made arrangements for a night stay at a local hotel. Next morning we find out that the rescheduled flight W02224 is also canceled. Now there is a new reschedule flight W0122 on Tuesday, September 18, 2018 at 1:20pm. We decided to go to the airport on Monday September 17/18 to find out what was going on. When we went to the airport that morning to the Swoop counter, the agent told us that the Monday flight W02224 is canceled and Tuesdays flight W0122 is also canceled and there is a new reschedule flight Wednesday September 19, 2018 on 1:20 pm. We told the Swoop Agent that we had to get back to our work of employment and that my daughter had to go back to her studies at the University of Alberta. We asked the Swoop counter Agent to help us get on a earlier flight, they refused and asked us to leave. We witnessed upset & frustrated passengers with similar issues actually being escorted out by security that was called out by Swoop counter agents for no major reasons that we saw. The Swoop counter agents overreacted to the upset & frustrated passengers. Feeling abandoned by Swoop Airlines and losing faith in Swoop, we ended up booking on a another airline Flair Airlines on Monday Sept. 17 at 8:35 and reached Edmonton. I contacted Swoop Airlines contact center 3 time on the phone (September 18, 19, 21, 2018) regarding the cancellation of our flights and have asked to speak to the management in charge. I have been told 3 time by Swoop contact center that someone from the management will call back. It has been 1 week and no calls from Swoop Airline management. We would like to get reimbursed for the additional cost for new Airline Tickets, Vehicle rental, Hotel accommodation, Food and lost Wages. It is the responsibility of Airlines to get their Passengers back to their destination on a timely manner. Cancellation of total 3 flights is not acceptable standard. No Accommodation or recourse was provided by the Swoop Airlines to their passengers.

### "a very good experience"
I read quite a few negative comments but we had a very good experience. The two of us flew for the first time with Swoop from Abbotsford to Edmonton September 21st and returned September 23rd with absolutely no problems. Considering this is a low cost airline, we knew we’d would have to pay for any extras which is typical for any budget airline. Booking was simple and the cost of add-ons was clear. Prompts for extras could quickly be by-passed if not required. We didn’t pay extra for seat selection as we don’t really mind where we sit on a plane and we were ok if we were not seated together for a short flight. Both times when we checked in manually before arriving at the airports, we were assigned adjacent seats anyways. Clear convenient options were provided at check in to print your boarding pass, download it, or have it emailed to you. Rules regarding minimal check-in time, baggage check-in, boarding time, restrictions, in-flight costs etc were very clear and repeated through-out the process. It was also clear if you were late and missed the minimum check in times, you would not be allowed to board and the plane would not wait for late passengers. When we arrived at the airport there was no line up, staff was efficient and friendly, and our check in was very quick. Flight was on time, the airplane was clean, and staff nice. An information announcement was made to download the Swoop app for entertainment. (I had already downloaded the app when booking our flight and found it user friendly). We had checked one bag which we retrieved quickly upon arrival and were on our way. Our flight back was a very similar experience. Check-in was quick again with a minimal wait and 4 staff members available. We were pleasantly surprised with the offer of upgraded seats on the emergency exit aisle which had a lot more leg room. Just after we cleared security, we received an email notification advising our flight was delayed 30 minutes which was fine as things happen and our flight boarded and left right on time for the new departure time. Again the plane was clean and the staff friendly. We would definitely fly Swoop again: We got an incredible deal on our flights (even with extras), the booking process was easy and quick, the Swoop app was easy to use, staff was friendly and polite at each part of the journey, flight was good especially with the upgraded seats and extra leg room, baggage arrived promptly and in good shape. Just make sure you read the rules before you book, are ok with the cost of any extras you may require and factor these costs in when price comparing, arrive on time, and follow the company’s rules - this is the same with any other airline. I hope we never run into one of the excessive time delays other passengers have mentioned, but considering our experience, we will definitely be flying Swoop again. It is great to have a safe low cost no frills (unless you want them) option to fly.

### "Poor Customer Service"
Edmonton to Hamilton. Poor Customer Service when airline at fault. Wait for CS on phone for more than 2 hrs and still can't get through. Then was told by counter staff to try sending email as there is nothing they can do, they got no management support from head office or PR to deal with issues. Cheap compensation, Flight delayed due to insufficient staff for 8 hrs, and was only given $20 meal voucher when a meal cost $30 per person per meal at the airport, spent another 20 minutes talking with counter staff in order to get extra $10 to cover 1 meal for the 8 hr period.

### "excellent no frills flight"
Edmonton to Hamilton. This was an excellent no frills flight. Even with prepurchasing a checked bag it was still half the cost of flying with westjet (preferred airline). The staff were very friendly and accommodating. I travel 3-4 times a year so I always bring my own food and drinks on the plane but they do have a decent snack menu that's not too overly priced. With Swoop, it's a super low fare but you will pay for anything that you want extra. A little preplanning and you will be just fine. They have a very limited fleet so dont expect a quick fix shall a problem arise, I've read a few reviews where they have flat out canceled trips and reserved flights for the passengers days later (although they did fully refund the money). It may not be for everyone but I would 100% suggest giving them a try. I would like to see them succeed and continue to offer these low fare flights but that is entirely up to its customers. Happy travels

### "definitely fly again"
Not Verified |  We flew from Edmonton to Abbotsford last sept 15. Flight was delayed for only an hour as it was snowing so bad. But the flight and crew were all super nice. Flight back to Edmonton was also delayed for an hour but that's ok too. We checked in our luggage and everything was fine contrary to the other reviews that they lost their luggage. I guess people need to arrive at the airport at least 2 hrs before the flight to avoid any problems. Would definitely fly again with swoop and already recommended it to all our friends and relatives. Very cheap price and comfortable too.

### "A complete waste of money"
Not Verified |  This is the most unreliable airline that I have ever flown. This is my third time flying with Swoop, from Abbotsford to Edmonton - I only booked because it was a last minute flight and they were the cheapest. Every flight I’ve been on has been delayed at least two hours and you don’t find out until 20 minutes before the flight time so you are having to sit and wait for hours extra. A complete waste of money if you ask me. Don’t fly Swoop.

### "delay more than 3 hours"
Abbotsford to Edmonton. Worst airline ever. They delay the flight more than 3 hours and offer no meal vouchers or answers. Staff is rude and lacks all knowledge and care to do their job even a little bit.

### "not recommend this airline"
Winnipeg to Hamilton. Terrible customer service on and off the plane. Our flight was diverted from Hamilton to Toronto due to heavy winds in Hamilton. Once we got to Toronto we were told we were just waiting to get a spot at a gate. This turned into over 2 hours of waiting on the plane. After 2 and a half hours they finally came around with half a small glass of water for everyone. You would think sitting in a hot plane for over 2 hours they would at least give you water, but no, they barely had enough on board to give everyone half a tiny glass. So after almost all customers had now made alternate plans to have family or friends pick them up from Pearson, they announce that we will be attempting fly back to Hamilton. The weather outside had gotten even worst, raining and so windy that the plane was shaking while even on the ground but because they’re too cheap to actually let us off at Pearson so they don’t have to pay to land there, we were heading back into a storm worst than what diverted us in the first place. They would not let anyone exit in Toronto. At this point you have babies screaming, everyone’s hot, thirsty and annoyed and the flight crews response was “we want to go home too and we don’t get paid while on the ground”. They announce that we were waiting to refuel and we would then be back up in the air for our “12 minute flight to Hamilton”. This went on for another hour at least to wait to refuel. Now I know the flight crew can’t control the weather but to not even give water to over 100 people sitting in a recycled air trap is just ridiculous. We eventually made it to Hamilton after about 20 minutes of turbulence the entire flight. They kept repeating that these decisions were being made for “our safety” yet the 15 minute flight was even worst than the original flight when we first attempted to land and diverted. Once on the ground the staff scurried like scared mice and where nowhere to be found. No vouchers for any of the inconvenience of having people drive back and forth from Hamilton to Toronto back to Hamilton to pick up their family and friends. Not even a voucher for a bottle of water. But I guess this shouldn’t be expected when they stock the bare minimum on their flights to begin with and seem cheap with everything. Overall terrible experience and would not recommend this airline. It may be ok if everything goes completely as planned but the second something goes off course they don’t seem to care at all. I would say spend the extra money and have the piece of mind that there would be at least enough water for all passengers should you get trapped in the plane for 4+ hours.

### "underwhelmed with Swoop"
Hamilton to Edmonton. Very underwhelmed with Swoop, Since it is a sister company of Westjet, I did have high hopes. Swoop's presence at Hamilton is definitely noticeable from check-in to boarding. Now the flight was smooth but the experience was lacking, a lot. Usually, the crew are the best part about the flight, in this case, not so much. The flight attendants had average customer service, but nothing going above and beyond. The pilots didn't bother communicating to the passengers at all (except before takeoff). The menu is extremely basic and on the more expensive end. They didn't offer snack options that appealed to us (noodles in a cup? really?) No wonder nobody wanted to purchase anything. One of the more ridiculous onboard rules they have is no complimentary water. There was a group behind me that asked for a water because there child was very thirsty and the crew continued to say no saying it's not included in your fare. The passengers had to pay $4 for water. Another thing I noticed is that they really like to overcharge passengers to pre-pay for their seat. ($45 for an exit-row seat). They seem to be taking the "ULCC" model to the extreme and it's certainly causing them to lose some of their reputation.

### "our flight has been cancelled"
Four of us booked flights in February 2018 to flight return Edmonton to Abbotsford (Sept 15-17). Got a great deal so we thought ($49 each way). We woke up Monday and received the below email indicating our flight has been cancelled and new departure is scheduled for September 22, 2018 (5 day delay). Called Swoop and was on hold for 1 1/2 hours. Nothing they could do except refund us our $49 ticket. The cheapest last minute flight we could find with Westjet was $337. Called Westjet (parent company) to see if they would offer us a discounted flight. Response was no. Ended up booking a flight with Air Canada for $249.00. Do not fly with this airline - apparently no extra planes when things like this arise. Dear Traveller, We are very sorry to inform you that your scheduled flight to Edmonton has been cancelled due to a lightning strike. As safety is the highest priority for us at Swoop, we need to inspect the aircraft before it can be returned to service. Below are your new flight details: Departing Flight WO124 Saturday, September 22, 2018 Abbotsford (YXX)Departs 6:05PM Edmonton (YEG) Arrives 8:24PM

### "problem arose at boarding"
Abbostsford to Edmonton. First time flying with them. Checking in online was not available due to technical difficulties. Tried several times during the day and could not do. Check in at the terminal was quick, efficient and the staff very friendly. Where the problem arose was at boarding - they had two flights departing at the same terminal at the same time. One to Winnipeg, the other to Edmonton. the girls managing the Winnipeg boarding were really good in announcing where the passengers were to check in, and kept control of the area. This did not happen on the Edmonton boarding. It was a crowd of people all gathered at the stand where they scan your boarding pass. The girls there should have been announcing every few minutes where Edmonton was boarding, when, etc but the choose not to, total chaos. The flight crew was very good, the interior of the plane looked new, seats a little tight but it is a discount airline. We were late taking off and arriving in Edmonton, not happy about that. The landing was really rough, must be a new pilot. The bags though were out in minutes so did appreciate that. I know it is early days for them and hope they get every running much smoother as they serve and fly more people.

### "had absolutely no problems"
vGreat airline. Got 4 tickets for less then the price of 1 ticket if I fly with Westjet or Air Canada. Bought a checked bag. Weight exceeded on the bag by a few pounds. No problems at all. Flew exactly on time and returning flight returned exactly on time. The seats were comfortable and inflight entertainment was great. Our family had absolutely no problems. We loved the flight and the crew were super friendly. We followed the simple rules they mentioned on the website which was show up early and dont expect freebies. Will be booking next flight very soon. We need more ultra low airlines to fly within Canada.

### "Very disappointed in this airline"
Halifax to Hamilton. Very disappointed in this airline. I arrived at the Hamilton airport an hour before departure time but unfortunately no one was at the Swoop counter to take my bag or check me in. I had not checked in earlier as I had trouble doing so on line. At about 35 minutes before the scheduled departure an attendant arrived at the counter. She told me it was too late for her to be able to check me in as they were already boarding. As a result, I was not able to take that flight and had to take a cab to Pearson airport and book with another airlines. Although friendly, the staff representative was not helpful and said she would try to log onto the system, even though, as she said, she knew it wouldn’t work, but would try “to humour me”. There was nothing funny about this. The moral of this message if something seems like too good of a bargain it probably is. I think this airlines is grossly understaffed and not worth the difference in the cost of the other airlines. I won’t be travelling with Swoop again.

### "truly a horrible airline"
If anything goes wrong with your flight, Swoop is extremely unaccommodating, and the risk is not worth it. I was supposed to fly out of Abbotsford on Sunday night, but my flight got rescheduled for Monday morning (note: Swoop will not reimburse you for accommodations). I found out at 2 AM on Monday morning that my flight got rescheduled for Wednesday. Meanwhile, the group I was travelling with was still scheduled to fly out on Monday morning. A traveller in the group payed for a different flight and flew out Sunday night with a different airline, so her seat was available. However, they wouldn't let me take her seat and told me there was nothing they could do. The group counted 17 empty seats on the "fully-booked" flight that I could have taken. All workers we encountered from Swoop were extremely unhelpful and did not even attempt to help us. Delaying a flight for 4 days without any sort of compensation is unacceptable. Because I am a student and have exams, I had to pay $350 for a different flight to fly out earlier. This is truly a horrible airline and I advise travellers to book elsewhere. Although this airline offers cheap flights, it is not worth the risk if anything goes wrong.

### "flight back been absolute nightmare"
We flew from Edmonton to Abbotsford with swoop and had little to no problems, our flight back however has been an absolute nightmare. The return flight was supposed to be leaving at 6:15pm, September 16th. When we got to the airport no one was at the counter to check our bags so we were forced to go through security with them and have our oversized liquids all thrown out ($30 value). Once we got to our gate the attendant for Swoop told us it would be $84 to check our bags even though we already paid $50 in the first place. After explaining that this is absolutely ridiculous they tagged our bags and said they would put them on the flight. Half an hour later the flight is deemed delayed. Another half an hour later the flight is canceled because apparently the plane had been hit by lightening when it landed. The flight agents said there is nothing they can do and nothing (hotel, transport, or food) will be covered. Unbelievable! So many people and families were left stranded at the Abbotsford airport. We then had to book a hotel for the night ($140) and wait until our rescheduled flight at 8:45am the next morning. Woke up to head to the airport only to receive an email saying this flight has now been canceled and the next flight we could take would be Tuesday the 18th at 6pm. That is 2 days after we are supposed to be home!!! It’s absolutely unbelievable. We went to the airport to see if there were any earlier flights and were just told, “no, our other fights are full and maybe go book a new flight with flair airlines instead”. No help, no reimbursement, nothing. So now we have had to spend money on a hotel, food, transport and additional flights ($400+) just to get home. I have been on hold with swoop customer service for 1.5 hours (still currently am) and have not spoken to anyone. I was so excited when I saw there was affordable airlines starting to operate within Canada but after this experience I will never use them again, and would advise anyone else to rethink booking through them.

### "Then things got worse"
Abbottsford to Edmonton. Came in to fly out on a Sunday night. Started boarding, then told our flight was cancelled and going to be rescheduled for the first thing next morning. Understandable, things happen and ultimately safety is most important when flying. Then things got worse. Little to no communication on everything. No hotel vouchers, food vouchers, nothing! All 150 people on this plane were now responsible for themselves. Unbelievable. We were fortunate enough to have family we could spend the extra night with. Could not imagine the hotel ordeal or having children traveling as many passengers did. Then, at 3am we get an email saying our new flight has now been cancelled and they have rechecked us for Wednesday afternoon! Are you kidding me! Fortunately we came to the airport early in the morning and managed to switch to another airline. After spending 45 minutes on hold with their customer service they refunded us the cost of the flight, but nothing for the huge inconvenience this has brought. My girlfriend and I have had to miss work, pay extra for our parking at our destination, and completely lose a day to this absolute garbage customer service. Neither I nor my significant other will ever be using this airline again and will be telling everyone we know of this experience.

### "cheap flights are a good idea"
Edmonton to Abbotsford. It’s amazing to have an airline that as a young family we can afford to go see my family in Vancouver. For short flights the planes are great and the staff are the same. Thanks to whoever decided these cheap flights are a good idea because it brings families closer.

### "been on hold for 51 minutes"
Abbotsford to Edmonton. So, I was in a situation where for sure reasons I could not fly out this morning. I called Swoop, was out on hold and there I stayed -  at 25 minutes I also called from my landline in case my cell battery died and was again put on hold. When I gave up I had been on hold on the original call for 51 minutes and then gave up on the landline at about 45 minutes. I took screen shots of my cell before it died to prove it. What’s the deal?

### "Many annoyed passengers"
Edmonton to Abbotsford. Long story short - reached the airport at 1pm with 2 toddlers and was told the flight was cancelled. Was offered the next flight out 8hrs later. No meal voucher offered, no other options, no sorry from the front agent. When I asked the agent why no email or call. She said she did not know. Received an email at 2.15pm 2 hrs before actual flight time of 430pm that flight has been "rescheduled". Most passenger would have made their way into the airport. Many annoyed passengers. Disappointed

### " Aircraft was clean"
Not Verified |  Abbotsford to Edmonton. Aside from being late on takeoff their and back, and some minor confusion at the desk, this felt no different than flying any other economy line, and cost $9. Not sure why people are complaining. Aircraft was clean and staff to standard. Really it was no different than a WestJet flight..

### "needs to get their act together"
Swoop needs to get their act together: We paid full price when the airline first starting selling tickets - they are now 1/2 price and as low as $9 to Edmonton. They are trying to get customers anyway they can. The airline has poor scheduling issues and cancels the flight if they don't have enough customers booked. This resulted in leaving us in Edmonton an additional 3 hours until their next flight landed. Our times were changed twice on the departure flight days before we even left. We had the same plane down as well as back - we could tell because of the same piece of dirt in the same spot. When I called to talk to a manager you couldn't get through and I finally emailed them and they gave us two $50 vouchers - probably my bad if I ever decide to use them. For the price we paid I should have gone with an airlines that have worked out the bugs in the system.

### "experience was terrible"
My experience with Swoop was terrible, (and still is as I have been on hold, waiting to talk to a customer service agent for 60 minutes with no luck!) I made a reservation for my daughter and me to fly from Abbotsford to Edmonton on Aug 31 to attend a memorial for a friend. When we arrived in Edmonton, my daughter realized that she would not be able to fly back with me on September 2nd. So she went online to the swoop website and cancelled her flight. The wording on the website said "Cancel flight for H. Johnston? Confirm? So she confirmed that was what she wanted. When I returned to the Edmonton airport on Sept. 2nd for the return flight , I was told that my flight was cancelled also and that I would need to rebook for $200+. I tried to explain the website cancellation had been only for my daughter, and not me, but they really didn't care and said it was out of their hands. I argued and asked to see a manager, but to no avail. I am now going into hour 2 of being on hold to try and get some resolution to this issue.. Customer service is pathetic. The agents in Edmonton were terrible, under trained and not the least bit interested in trying to problem solve for a paying customer. They are only capable of looking at a computer screen and reading back what it says. Swoop has lost me as a customer. I actually waited 2 hours and 5 minutes before being connected with an actual Swoop rep. She said it is impossible to make partial cancellations online. We went round and round until I asked to speak to her manager The manager also insisted that Heather, my daughter must have cancelled both reservations and no matter how much I insisted that the website had said "Heather J.... confirm cancellation" she would not acknowledge that this happened. She said partial reservations can only be cancelled by telephoning a customer service representative. I suggested that if every customer who wanted to cancel a partial reservation had to wait 2 hours to actually talk to a person ( as I did today) that perhaps their website and systems needed fixing. She stated they were thinking about changing the system but had not yet done so. She also stated that the reason I had to wait so long today is that they were backlogged with calls because their call centre was closed on Saturday and Sunday! What the hell!! She then covered that tidbit of info by saying that they do have agents who respond to emails 24/7!! So here's what I got from all that. Don't use their website to cancel partial reservations because their system can't handle it. Instead call them directly(which by the way, they state will cost you $15.00 plus applicable taxes and it may take 2 hours + to get an answer! However once you do call, be aware that the call centre might be closed so you will never get an answer. In that case you will have to email them and I have no idea how long their response to an email might take! Totally laughable! She said she could do nothing for me and when I suggested that she indeed could do something by offering me a refund,as a gesture of good will, for the return ticket plus baggage charges that I had to pay the second time. She refused. She put the icing on the cake for me when she said that she really appreciated my feedback because they would use the info I provided as a coaching opportunity! Unbelievable! . Neither my daughter or I received any notification of a cancellation being made. Yet another oversight I guess

### "absolutely loved it"
Winnipeg to Hamilton. I flew with Swoop for the first time and I absolutely loved it. There were no delays and the Hamilton airport was not busy. The flight crew was super friendly. I have experience flying with Westjet and Air Canada but Swoop is the best flight I had. I loved the flight.

### "a disorganized mess"
Abbotsford to Edmonton. Swoop is a disorganized mess, not worth the discounted price! In addition to their constant prompts to purchase additional services that are basic on other airlines, boarding in Abbotsford was chaotic: they decided to board two separate planes (heading to Edmonton and Hamilton) out of the same gate, at the same time- leading to a great amount of confusion and delayed take off for both flights. On my return flight we were delayed multiple times, and only received notice of these delays when it was time to board. Looking for an explanation, staff were not helpful, knowledgable, or pleasant to interact with. I do not recommend flying with swoop as appealing as the cheaper prices might be, and am not optimistic about their ability to get their shit together in the future.

### "will recommend Swoop"
Hamilton to Abbotsford. An exceptional flight experience for an ultra-low price... I don't understand the reviews of this airline, it's an ultra-low cost, no frills airline - and that's exactly what I experienced. My family and I flew return from Hamilton to Abbotsford  in August and the experience was flawless. The flight attendants were patient, friendly and helpful. At one point, the attendants began meal/drink service (they announced they'd be doing so) and some passengers kept trying to squeeze by the cart to go to the washroom (everyone should know this is rude and ignorant toward the staff) and the attendants were friendly and would move the cart to the front of the plane so passengers could continue to use the facilities. My only critique is that the meal options were slim (no sandwiches or wraps), they only had snacks available for purchase (hummus, crackers etc.) I think on a longer flights (4+ hours) there should be small meals available for purchase. I also recommend upgrading to the larger seats - I sat in both a regular seat, and an extra leg room seat - for the price, the larger seat is worth it. I would definitely fly this airline again and will recommend Swoop.

### "a fine discount airline"
. No complaints. This is a fine discount airline. Good value for price (more than half off major airlines) Friendly flight staff. Clean plane. Seats ok. Food ok. You have to pay for bags, food and internet. Free in flight movies and shows with Swoop app. All fine considering price of ticket. If you arrive on time (90 minutes before minimum) and have checked in online it's fast at the airport to get through. I give it an 8 out of 10 only because the seat comfort is ok and the in flight food could be better. That being said I have taken worse flights and paid way more with major airlines.

### "the flight was also great"
Abbotsford to Edmonton. First time flying with Swoop. The price was incredible and the flight was also great. Everything was like I expected and we even arrived early. The aircraft was clean and comfortable and the crew were very helpful. I will definitely be flying with Swoop again.

### "flight crew was friendly"
Not Verified |  Hamilton to Abbottsford. I flew with my husband, autistic toddler, and my 3 month old son. We had a great experience. I had to call a head to make sure they were aware of my sons disability and they were very accommodating! It is a "get what you pay for" airline and I had pre booked all our bags and our seats so there were no surprise fees. At the check in gate they did not have that I paid for 2 checked bags, but I showed them my confirmation letter and they quickly fixed it for me, no harm done. Free entertainment if you download their app before the flight, so there are options for you available you just have to look into before. The flight crew was friendly and the flight was smooth. Overall I will recommend their services in the future!

### "price was incredible"
Abbotsford to Edmonton. I would totally travel with Swoop again. The price was incredible, staff was great, comfy seats, and inflight entertainment was awesome. Thank you for getting me to Edmonton and back! Looking forward to more adventures

### Swoop customer review
Edmonton to Phoenix booking cancelled. Their $100 refund charge seemed reasonable to me, but when I also purchased the ModiFLY option, I thought I was buying some protection for changes. Turns out that any additional fees you pay, if you cancel, are NOT refundable, you pay for the $100 and ModifLY charges, and any other add-ons. Also, the $100 is not just per booking, but per flight per person. My first experience with Swoop is that they would not reason, they will not budge on what they feel is policy, and they will take your money and run. I was charged $241.96 for what I thought would be a $100 cancellation fee. This was my first experience with them. I had bought the Modifly option, and they did not acknowledge it, or offer a solution to rebook or reschedule. On their main website, there is no link to sign into your account! You have to find your booking confirmation number, and use that in order to get to a webpage where you can sign in. Then, that's where I discovered that I was being charged, not $100, but $241.96. If you feel you can take the risk, then I hope it works out for you. This seemed extremely unbelievable. I feel like I was robbed.

### "crew were very friendly"
Hamilton to Halifax. Flew Swoop for the first time, round trip Hamilton to Halifax. Check in and luggage check in were the smallest lines of both airports, and all the staff and crew were very friendly. Both flights were on time (within 20 min) and flight was smooth and comfortable. Just make sure you read all the rules (regarding carry ons and getting there early enough) and you’ll be fine. My only complaint would be that the Swoop app is a little buggy if you wish to check in using the app.

### "flight crew are nice"
Hamilton to Winnipeg. Airfare is cheap. Everything needs to paid of course. Flight crew are nice except for the ground crews who are not accomodating and courteous. Not fit to be in that position.

### "such a lack of organization"
Not Verified |  Abbotsford to Hamilton. Pretty awful customer service. I've flown these economy airlines before (like Spirit) and you do get what you pay for. However, I've never seen such a lack of organization, and lack of care. After specifically having a conversation at the check-in counter in Abbotsford, BC about me checking in early for my flight to Hamilton, the attendant seemed very confused. She was instructed by another agent to highlight my bag tag and speak to baggage crew to ensure it did not get put on an earlier flight. Instead, there was a black marker scribble on it when I found it. Luckily my travel partner, who took an earlier flight to Winnipeg, spotted my bag on the baggage carousel when he arrived there. He retrieved it for me and brought it to the attendant there. I spoke to her over the phone and chose the fastest option to get my bag back: It would be on the earliest flight into Hamilton the next day with a rushed/flagged order on it and I would be contacted when it arrived. I opted not to get it shipped to my home in Hamilton based on the lack of competence thus far. I also confirmed with an agent at the Abbotsford airport that I would definitely receive a phone call right when my bag arrived. I was assured this was the case. I received no call at all the next day, and when I tried to call Swoop, waited on hold for 30 minutes without anyone answering the phone. Their phone hours then ended at 4:30 PM on Saturday, so I was unable to even get through to be on hold, and they were closed on Sunday. After speaking to security at the Hamilton airport, I decided to just drive out there at 10 PM that night, since a Swoop flight was arriving. There were no Swoop agents at the front desk. Security directed me to an agent, and I found my bag sitting in the back room with two agents, not locked, and still no phone call to inform me. This Swoop agent also seemed confused, saying she thought this bag was getting shipped off to Edmonton. Thank goodness I went to take matters into my own hands. I'm not sure anyone would have ever called me. Moral of the story: Cheap flights. Lots of promises with no action. Do not check bags with them (which you pay for). Will not answer phone calls (and if they do, they try to charge you a $15 "service fee").

### "I would fly Swoop again"
Edmonton to Hamilton. Swoop surpassed my expectations. I was prepared with water and snacks as I didn't want to purchase these things on board. I am 6 feet tall, and was expecting the legroom to be lacking, but I was comfortable! I did not upgrade seats. There were a couple of inches between my knees and the seat in front of me. The under-seat space for my personal item was ample. I brought a very large purse and a small backpack for my daughter, both fit with room to spare. The seats were comfortable and roomy. I also noticed that my seat didn't recline, and I don't think it was because it was broken. I didn't see anyone reclining their seats, so I believe this feature was not built into these seats. And I actually prefer it that way, as travelling with young children, they are on your lap and moving quite a bit, and reclining seats take up valuable space. The biggest issue that came up involved our car seat. We checked it in oversized luggage in Edmonton, and it did not make it on to our plane. There was another family in the same situation when we arrived in Hamilton. Swoop offered us replacements for the missing car seat, and boosters for the other family. On the spot, we were issued new in-the-box seats and a follow-up and return of our missing equipment was promised. This situation went from panic, (as it is illegal and unsafe to transport a young child without a car seat, so we were effectively stranded) to a reasonable and fair solution. We were held up for a few minutes while the airline staff wrote out our forms and organized things, but I give Swoop big credit for stepping up and fixing things since, as I mentioned, this was not their fault. I would fly Swoop again. The key to enjoying this airline is knowing your baggage limitations, and being prepared for the no-frills service.

### "worst customer service"
Edmonton to Abbotsford. I am a pregnant 26 year old with a back injury due to a car accident and decided to try and fly with Swoop last week to go visit friends and family. They assured and reassured me over the phone that after I arrived in Edmonton, AB from a different airline they would have someone from their airline to pick me up at my gate with a wheelchair, take me to baggage and back up to the Swoop counter in time to catch my flight. When my plane landed there was no one there to pick me up so the other airline had to deliver me to baggage and then had an information agent take me up to the Swoop counter, where there was no one available to check in my bag. So due to all the misled information I received over the phone by Swoop I ended up missing my flight and was left stranded at the Edmonton airport alone overnight and now the company refuses to take responsibility or honour any type of remuneration to rectify the situation. Don’t fly Swoop unless you want to receive the worst customer service you’ve ever experienced.

### "charge for my carryon"
Edmonton to Abbotsford. Terrible service. They wanted to charge for my carryon when it states I am permitted one carryon. But attendant demanded I pay $82. I would not recommend it.

### "did not accommodate pets"
Edmonton to Abbotsford. I booked my flight the evening before my afternoon departure the following day. After booking my flight online I started to search the website for the contact number so that I could call in to add my pet to the itinerary. During that search I came across the section that outlined that this airline did not accommodate pets for travel. I couldn’t call the airline immediately because their call center was already closed and they do not have a 24 hour line of communication. I called the following day and explained my situation only for the employee to tell me that the airline will not issue me any kind of credit or refund because I am changing my flight within 24 hours of booking it and that is their “policy”. Mind you I paid almost $300.00 for the one way flight. The employee didn’t offer me any other options nor did she sound sympathetic in the slightest way.

### "pleased with my first flight"
Not Verified |  Hamilton to Abbotsford. Had a fantastic experience with Swoop airlines with my family travelling from Ontario to BC. The airplane was new, flight attendants were pleasant and helpful and departure and arrival were on time. Yes you need to pay for your carry on luggage which is comparibly priced to other leading airlines in Canada as long as you buy in advance. I travelled with my three young children aged 7, 5, and 2. Both the flight attendants made sure to introduce themselves prior to the flight and check in frequently to make sure the kids were comfortable throughout the flight. I think people need to be a bit more understanding of a few things: 1. This is a new airline, there are going to be bumps in the road and if you are getting a great price you need to be cognizant of that. 2. There are going to be minor delays and inconvenience, and this happens with all airlines I never experienced any of these problems and was very pleased with my first flight with Swoop airline!

### "budget airline is a great option"
Hamilton to Winnipeg. This budget airline is a great option for anyone looking to save money with no-frills flying. I was hesitant to use it, since a lot of the reviews were quite horrible, but after my experience I don't understand where these other people are coming from. First of all, I had no issues getting on board, if you follow the times and rules you will have no issues, as with any other airline. If they say you must check in by a certain time and you don't, and you cannot get on because of that, that is your fault not a problem with the airline. My first flight was delayed by an hour, which wasn't great but these things happen, and we were politely kept informed through everything. They let us know as soon as the delay happened, through the app and through the announcement in the terminal. They updated us when maintenance crew was on their way, when they arrived, when they were completed, and when we could start boarding. It honestly was more information than I would have expected from any airline. I did not pay for extra legroom seating and still found the space adequate, mind you I am not a large or tall person. The space is less than you get from non-discount airlines but not as significant of a difference as I was expecting from the comments. There were people behind me with extra legroom and they commented how good it was, so I believe if you are worried that would be a good option for you. You'd likely still save money even after the extra costs. The seats were not comfortable but not much less than an average flight, I would struggle on a long-haul flight in them (mine was a 2 hour flight) as with any long-haul flight, but for short distances it was fine and again, I think the difference in comfort wasn't much compared to the difference in price. The flight attendants and pilot were some of the friendliest I have experienced from any airline and were incredibly helpful and entertaining, this part especially made the flight seem less budget-oriented. They do nickle-and-dime you for everything, and I paid $30 each way for carry-on luggage, so if you are pricing airlines be sure to account for any of these extra charges you may want added on when you are comparing prices. You also have to pay per hour ($6.49/hour) for the in flight wifi which I didn't know going in, so I just skipped using, but the people beside me connected and streamed movies on their phone without issues. All that being said, I paid less than half of what I would with any other airline. The flight cost was just over $300 there and back and usually the trip would have cost me over $700. This made it so I could actually afford to go see family, so I am very grateful to Swoop for providing this service! If you are truly a traveller on a budget this is a great option! I had zero issues and you likely will too. If you are looking for all the above and beyond comforts, you shouldn't be looking at discount airlines anyways. Of course they charge for every extra, but that means you only pay for what YOU want, it's more like a custom built flight experience. Save money on getting there and have more money for fun at your destination! I will definitely consider flying with Swoop again.

### "unable to bring my small pet dog"
I have booked a flight for Jan 2019 to visit my son and his wife in Edmonton Alberta but I am very disappointed that i am unable to bring my small pet dog- a Cavalier King Charles. (18-19 lbs). I hope that in the near future Swoop will change their policy about pets on flights so that i can continue to book with this airline.

### "definitely recommend it"
Not Verified |  I just returned yesterday from our trip -Abbotsford to Edmonton return - on Swoop, myself and my two grandchildren. I would like to give the 2 thumbs up to the counter staff and the flight attendants for their friendly service and overall professionalism. For the price and the convenience of not having to drive to the Vancouver International Airport. I was more than satisfied with Swoop Airlines. Yes, I had to pay for my suitcase and had to purchase the food on board but I knew all that before I booked and again the price and the convenience! Would definitely take Swoop again and if price and convenience is important to you would definitely recommend it.

### "lost us as return customers"
Not Verified |  My wife and I flew Swoop Airlines for the first time from Edmonton to Abbotsford 07/26/2018 with no issues. We were booked to return from Abbotsford to Edmonton on Sunday 07/29/2018. Departed our accommodation with 2 hours to the 45 minute boarding cutoff. Due to a traffic accident on the TCH #1, the normal 40 minute drive to the airport became a 2 hour misadventure. We arrived at YXX Abbotsford Airport, hoping that the bag check in was still open. It was not, and upon contacting the Swoop customer service airline, the office was closed on 'Sundays and statutory holidays. No Swoop personnel at the check in, and we were forced to book a flight on the following day. Most unpleasant experience on the return to Edmonton, with no customer service and even less compassion. Swoop has lost us as return customers, and we'll tell others to avoid this Mickey Mouse show. And unless one wants to get stung with a $15 plus tax charge to lodge a complaint, then it's not even worth the aggravation to do that!

### Swoop customer review
Hamilton to Edmonton, the flight was delayed for two and a half hours because the pilot didn’t show up for work. This was announced approximately a half-hour before boarding, at which point they had already made the welcome announcement for the flight. The agent then announced the “good news” that they had found another pilot but that we would be leaving 2.5 hours behind schedule. We had a connecting flight with Air Canada from Edmonton which we missed because of this. I deliberately left a three hour layover between flights, but it wasn’t enough and I had to pay $500 for two people to rebook that flight. I know that Canadian passengers have few rights in these situations, but I asked the agent at the desk in Hamilton what Swoop intended to do to address this situation. As other passengers have noted, Swoop agents were utterly unhelpful and useless. She gave me a card with a customer service number and pointed out that I would have to pay $15 to call this number. So, Swoop wanted to charge me $15 to call them about making us late because their employee didn’t bother to show up for work, on top of the $500 I had to pay because of the late departure. Oh, and the customer service line was closed at this time anyway. All of this leads me to two conclusions: 1. Never fly Swoop and 2. Canada desperately needs an enhanced passenger bill of rights.

### "seats are uncomfortable"
Abbotsford to Hamilton. I bought a brand new high-quality luggage bag, I checked my luggage in perfect new condition and got it back in terrible shape. One of the zippers is broken off and it is so scraped up. The logo is completely scratched out and the plastic on the bottom is all torn up. Besides that, the plane is so small and crowded, seats are uncomfortable, and the food selection is poor.

### "never fly on Swoop again"
Abbotsford to Hamilton. Off to a bad start! My 12 year old is traveling alone, and Swoop couldn't offer a guardian pass to accompany him through the arduous task of security or getting to his gate safely or successfully. I will never fly on Swoop again or send a loved one on that airline.

### "never purchase with swoop again"
Abbotsford to Edmonton. I bought two tickets, since I wasn’t allowed the option of round trip, only one way tickets. 12 days before my trip, I had to make the decision to cancel due to family illness. Swoop.com wouldn’t allow me to cancel online, I had to call. I called, waited 45mins online. When she went to cancel, at the end for one way ticket, she told me I would owe them?!! However, she waived that fee. So, $50 and taxes for each ticket and they also kept my money for my bag which for two tickets, was the entire amount! So, needless to say, I lost $200 to cancel 12 days in advance! Thanks swoop for stealing my money, especially baggage money, for bags that won’t even be on the flight! I will never purchase with swoop again!

### "incredibly pleased with this airline"
My husband and I flew with Swoop from Halifax to Hamilton and were incredibly pleased with this airline. As long as you read their guidelines (and follow them, ahem, arrive more than 45 minutes ahead of time), you will have no issues! We flew a lot in Australia using budget airlines and this one far succeeded our expectations. Will definitely be booking again with Swoop!

### "unsupportive and unsympathetic"
Not Verified |  I was supposed to fly home to Hamilton today from Halifax with my infant son. I arrived at the airport and received terrible customer service from swoop. I was turned away because I was 5 minutes passed their deadline to check-in. The counter agents where rude and unsupportive. They offered no solutions to my problem, just said I would not be getting on the flight. I phoned swoop and waited to for an hour on the phone to speak to an agent. The agents were rude and unfriendly. Both the agent and manager told me they would not put me on a flight home tomorrow and would not give me anything for my missed flight. They said it was my fault I missed the flight and were unsupportive and unsympathetic. I realize now that the fine print says you have arrive 45 minutes prior to leaving. Unfortunately life happens and when travelling with children you sometimes fall behind. The complete lack of support, kindness and professionalism was disgusting. I would recommend never booking with swoop. It is not worth it if something goes wrong.

### "upset about the luggage fees"
I booked a flight for my son, daughter and I on Swoop to visit family in August 2018. Unfortunately, due to a work conflict my son was not able to join. I cancelled the trip 3 weeks before we were to travel. I understand, though am not happy with the fact that the refund is Swoop credit that expire in 90 days. What I am really upset about is the luggage fees. We were only going to travel with 2 suitcases between the 3 of us. I purchase one for my ticket and one for my sons. Since he is no longer travelling the money we paid is gone, not refunded and not transferable to my daughter who is still part of the original reservation. My daughter and I still need a second suitcase which I now need to purchase again. So I lost the seat selection fee, lost the $60 I paid to check a suitcase and need to pay another $60 to get the second suitcase on board even though I originally paid for 2. My flight east is now more expensive the with the other more common airlines and I still get only the discounted service. As a person who travels a lot for business and personal this is a real shame. Been looking forward to sending my business to someone other then Air Canada and apparently that isn't going to happen any time soon. Really sad news for us travelers.

### "go in with zero expectations"
Not Verified |  We flew Swoop from Hamilton to Edmonton at the end of June with two toddlers. The flight to Edmonton from Hamilton was fine, the wifi did not work the entire flight which was annoying but the rest of the amenities on board were pretty standard. Our July 7th flight home on the other hand was non-existent. Swoop advises passengers check-in closes 45 minutes before the flight, we arrived 1 hour before our flight, there were 2 attendants working the check-in counter both had passengers with "issues", by the time the couple ahead of us got to the wicket the attendant stated "sorry the flight has been cut we cannot check you in". That was it, done deal. Our flight was scheduled for 10:25am, check-in closed at 9:40am, the couple in front of us got to the wicket at 9:53am the two attendants knew we were all in line waiting but made no attempt to get assistance or put the passengers with issues aside to get us checked in. Swoop's attendants left us stranded in the airport with a customer service number that was useless. We received zero compensation and had to pay an additional $1500 to get our family home with another airline. To top it all off the flight was delayed due to lightning and did not leave till after 10:25am - we absolutely could have made our flight. I do not recommend flying this airline, the staff from the check-in desk to the customer service call center is uncompassionate and extremely rude. If you choose to fly Swoop go in with zero expectations and you might have a good experience, If they let you board the plane!

### "agent called us liars"
Hamilton to Halifax. At 1:42pm on a Sunday we received an email saying that our flight was delayed by 30 minutes now leaving at 5:30pm not 5:00pm anymore. With the new departure time we arrived at the airport to check in at 4:30pm. My husband went to return the rental car and I went to check our bag, we were already checked in. The gate agent told me they were closed. I said ‘What are you talking about?’ and she pointed to a sign telling me there was a customer service number I could call. I called the number and customer service was closed on Sundays. I chased her down because she left the desk and she said she was going to get a supervisor. I kept saying this doesn’t make sense and she told me the plane wasn’t even there yet. I called my husband and told him they’re not letting us on the plane. The supervisor came and she confirmed this. I said I have a 4 year old and a 2 year old I had to get home to and she didn’t care. My husband in the mean time called WestJet customer service. Long story short the supervisors phone rang and my husband said ‘We’re getting on the plane right?’ She nodded. We are very frequent flyers with WestJet. We were told we were getting on the plane but our bag would not be travelling with us. We live 3.5 hours from the airport in NS. When I called the next day it was in the notes we were irate and the customer service agent called us liars, they wanted us to pay to get our bag to us. A girlfriend was going to the airport and got it for us. I was horrified at how we were treated when we were there 15 minutes before the 45 minute cut off time listed on their website. Everything else could have been ok but that kind of fear, to be left there with no where to go when I have young children at home makes this airline not worth anything. Poor, disgusting behaviour.

### "a total embarrassment"
Hamilton to Abbotsford. A wooden bench to sit on would be an upgrade. Gives new meaning to the term All A-'Board'. I used to think Air Transat in the USA was the worst airline I'd ever flown. My $250 one way flight turned into $900 with an error they refused to fix. One passenger slept across many benches in the waiting section and woke up only to remove his shoes. Almost lost my breakfast. Entertainment system was broken. This cheapskate airline is a total embarrassment to Westjet and Alberta.

### "last experience with Swoop"
This is my very first experience with Swoop and already a very bad one. I just used my regular carry one case, which I have been using many times in other airlines such as Air Canada and Westjet. However, they did not allow my carry one in even though I have fully paid for it. They even not accepted the credit, that I have paid for the Carry one, to be applied to the newly incurred charge of $42 (for checked bag at the time of boarding). It's totally outrageous. I know you would say, cheap ticket, even cheaper customer service. I guess this is my first and last experience with Swoop.

### "The pricing was amazing"
The pricing was amazing. The pricing was amazing and the cost to check a bag was comparable to other airlines when I booked my flight ($260 round trip with a checked bag there and back!). The staff were very friendly and I had no issues with either flight. Both flights were on-time or very close to on-time. They offered free inflight entertainment for the summer as a promo which was great but did cut out a bit throughout the flight. A heads up that they only accept major credit cards for inflight purchases. I can see connecting flights being an issue as other customers experienced. I don't think I would book a connecting flight due to the limited time options and that there is no guarantee it will depart or arrive on time. Check in was easy online and like any airline you need to adhere to their strict check in times so I made sure to arrive early in case there was any issue. The seats are small but again they are trying to get as many people on as possible to give a discount. If you need more room pay the extra for more space. I hope they stay in business in the long-term as it is great option for those of us who are fine with no frill flying so they can take the trips within Canada they want to without breaking the bank.

### "really enjoyed our flight"
Abbotsford to Hamilton. We really enjoyed our flight. We booked early and chose the cheapest seats and to our surprise, we had double the leg room. I have always had a stop in Calgary trying to save money and swoop was a direct flight-cutting down travel time by 2 hours. Luggage arrived in good condition. You get what you paid for- we brought our own water bottles so didn’t need any beverage service. Staff was friendly and flight was smooth!

### "how uncompassionate they were"
Hamilton to Halifax. I have flown a lot, and never have I been treated so terribly. I was unable to check in online due to a computer system error and we arrived 5 minutes late for the 45 minute check in at the airport. We had no bags to be checked and apologized that we were not there at the 45 minute mark. A stewardess was so nice and said it was no problem; the flight is delayed because they just waited 20 minutes for passengers on the incoming flight because "we don't leave any passengers behind". (Please mind you the Hamilton airport takes 5 minutes to get threw security). A pilot came out from the incoming flight and told us he couldn't get us through - another passenger came after us and they helped her get threw because she checked in online but would not help us. I called customer service and the lady was extremely rude telling me it was all my fault. I told her I understood we had just missed the 45 minute mark but we had a 9 month baby at home who did not have a place to stay tonight. She was rude, but said she would change the system only this one time so we could board. She heard the other late passenger being helped and said "oh it looks like you are being taken care of so I don't need to help you". The supervisor at the airport refused to let us through security and told us to call the call center only after the plane was fully boarded. She showed no compassion and told us we should have been on time. I called customer service back and they said they charge low prices so there would be no compensation or help rebooking a flight. After telling them how uncompassionate they were for only being flying for a few days they told us they would send one of us home the next day, and the other 6 days later. We told them that was unacceptable and they said "that is your choice". We ended up not getting any compensation or help rebooking. We paid 700$ for another flight with another airline so we could get home to our daughter at Pearson Airport. Moral of this very long story is do not fly with this airline. If you have uncontrollable circumstances such as traffic, which is common in the area, they will not allow you to board or help you to get home.

### "worst treatment ever"
First day disaster on Swoop. My son was booked on Swoop from Abbotsford to Hamilton and 68 mins after arriving in Hamilton, on swoop to Halifax. Two texts early in morning saying flight would be late both wrong. Times given Flight leaves Abbotsford 90 mins late, arrives Hamilton 90 mins late. No connection, Swoop flight to Halifax gone. Swoops attitude not their problem. Would not even honor ticket to Halifax on next day. My son had to pay for hotel, food and refused to pay for another ticket to Halifax. Booked on Flair instead. Don't fly Swoop, worst treatment ever by an airline in 30 years.
