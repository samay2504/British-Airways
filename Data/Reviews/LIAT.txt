### "Suitcase not travel same time as you"
Grenada to Guadeloupe via Barbados. Do not travel on Liat with a suitcase. Suitcase will not travel same time as you, even with plane nearly empty it take more than 3 days for the suitcase to arrive in Guadeloupe, and been opened by flight company.

### "Excellent experience"
Flew LIAT from Dominica to Martinique via Bridgetown. Excellent experience on this regional airline. Ground staff in Melville Hall very helpful and attentive, on time, wonderful flight and all in all great fun.

### "was comfortable enough"
Not Verified |  Piarco to Grenada. A no-frills airline, though efficient. Staff at check in at arrival/departure were polite, very helpful and efficient. I experienced difficulty in accessing and using the on-line check in service, though this proved to be no obstacle at the check in desk. The aircraft, while obviously well-used and aging somewhat allowed reasonable leg-room (I'm 6'5") and was comfortable enough to doze through the flight.

### "experience was absolutely atrocious"
Myself and my fiancé were on our way back from Barbados in December 2017 and we had to get a connecting flight from Barbados to Antigua and then to London. When we checked in for our flight, to our shock that is when we found out that our flight had been changed with no prior notice. So at the last minute we found out that we were no longer going straight to Antigua but we now had to stop over at Guadeloupe first, then to Antigua. We were not notified of these changes to our outbound flight and we found this to be highly unprofessional! The biggest problem was having to stop off at Guadeloupe – in doing so, we lost a lot of time. Our stop off in Guadeloupe lasted for around 20 minutes and by the time we got to Antigua, we had lost a lot of time and we weren’t able to collect our luggage. Also, when we got to Antigua we were given the wrong information regarding where to go, it seemed like nobody knew what they were doing! So by the time we went to collect our luggage, it turns out our flight had already boarded and the gates were about to close. Just as we were standing near luggage collection, I could see my hand luggage but the staff did not allow me to collect my case before I boarded the plane so we were forced to go without our luggage. The fact that LIAT gave us an extra stop on our journey caused so many problems and it absolutely ruined our return flight home!! We payed £60 for our seats and we were so distressed about our luggage being left in Antigua that we couldn’t enjoy our flight or even relax. When we got back to London, we had to fill out paperwork and wait for 2 days before we got our luggage back. We found the entire service from LIAT to be a very disappointing experience, their customer service is very poor and they really need to do better! For our first time travelling with LIAT, it was so bad that we both feel like we will never take another LIAT flight again. The experience was absolutely atrocious.

### "old, crowded prop plane"
Barbados to St. Vincent. You have few options in this section of the Caribbean so you have to suck it up and board an old, crowded prop plane. The bathroom stink is very, very strong. The female flight attendant was surly. Beware! Do not purchase extra luggage $60 ahead unless you are 100% sure you will need it. IF you fly with one checked bag you will not get a refund for the 2nd bag you purchased.

### "All staff interactions were great"
Flew Bridgetown to Georgetown. Everyone mocks LIAT but nothing to complain about. Flight left on time at 1945. All staff interactions were great. No one seated beside me helped as the ATR is a disgustingly cramped plane. Flight attendant came back with a full can of Coke when asked and announcements from the flight deck were exceptional. On arrival bags arrived quickly and it wasn't LIAT's fault that the Customs people were so laughably thorough. If LIAT kept this up they wouldn't be mocked.

### "one of the most poorly run airlines"
Grenada to Port of Spain. LIAT is one of the most poorly run airlines I've encountered. Our flight was delayed in Grenada, but still showed as "on time" on the display board at the airport even though it was 30 minutes past the scheduled departure times. We were given no explanation or estimate as to when the flight might depart. In fact, there were no airline employees anywhere to be seen at the gate. It would have been nice if they would have had someone come offer to help expedite checking in for connecting flights in Port of Spain. The airport closes the check-in counters quite far in advance of flight times and getting through immigration and customs is slow. Our flight ended up leaving about an hour late. The aircraft crew were the only professional part of the experience. Upon arrival in Port of Spain, the hour delay made it impossible to check in for my connecting flight, even though I found a customs agent willing to help expedite me through a rather lengthy line. I met a fellow passenger in the same situation as me, and we realized we had basically just been left stranded in a foreign airport with no idea how to resolve our situation. There were no Liat agents at the ticket counter to consult with about rebooking the flight or booking accommodations. A local Trinidian resident noticed we were seemed lost and offered to help, but didn't know what to do. A random baggage handler (not affiliated with Liat) noticed that myself and the other passenger seemed a bit lost and distressed and offered to call and see if a Liat agent was available. One finally showed up at the counter, but then refused to provide any compensation or explanation for the delay. He just played with his mobile phone and gave a half smile whenever I tred to interact with him. He told several other passengers he would leave a note for the connecting airlines representative (who also was not available) and we should have seats on the same flight 24 hours later. No confirmation of the booking, hotel vouchers, or food vouchers were provided. I rebooked the flight myself to ensure that I would have a seat the next day. The lack of customer service from the ground operation of Liat both in Grenada and Port of Spain was appalling. I will be rebooking my return flight through another carrier even if I have to eat the cost of the Liat ticket.

### "I was very pleasantly surprised"
Trinidad to Barbados. I was planning a long weekend with friends in Trinidad. I live (mostly) in Barbados but also in London, UK. I'd been umming and aahhing between LIAT and Caribbean Airlines and I checked out the reviews for LIAT which are definitely not good. I regularly fly between Barbados and Jamaica via Caribbean Airlines, which involves a stop/transit through Trinidad and my transit experiences have not been good. Delays, cancellations etc. One time arriving in Barbados at around 3.00a.m. instead of the scheduled 9.45m and anyone who knows Piarco airport would agree that it has to be the most soulless airport ever, no information is given, few places to eat, get a coffee etc. Piarco departure lounge is BRUTAL. In the end, I decided on Caribbean Airlines for my outward bound flight and LIAT for my return. I rationalised that if the CA flight due to depart at around 8.45 was late, I could spend hours there, whereas if I took the afternoon LIAT fight, even with cancellations, that I stood a reasonably good chance of arriving in Barbados before midnight. As it happens, luck seemed to have been on my side. LIAT reviews are full of tales of delays cancellations, rude staff wtc. I'm happy to say that this was not my experience. The flight departed 5 minutes later than its scheduled 2.35 pm time slot,, which in aviation/airline term is not at all late, and got me into Barbados within the hour. All staff were pleasant and helpful as needed. We were served a beverage, which CA did not offer on the outward bound journey. Flight was pleasant, seats were reasonably comfortable, pilot/captain kept us informed, and I really liked their inflight magazine. Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised, because as I said LIAT has very poor reviews and everyone that I had consulted prior to booking had warned me off LIAT. As I say, I may just have been very fortunate, but for this flight at least, everything went well, and if LIAT could maintain this standard, I would happily fly LIAT again, even though I'm a confirmed CA fan!

### "They have no shame"
Bridgetown to Marigot. We arrived from New York to Bridgetown and at 9 am was supposed to leave our flight with LIAT to Dominica. Until 11 am the crew didn't informed us that the flight was cancelled. The comunication was very vague and only if we asked. They put us in a flight at 6:45 pm. Was another flight at 2 pm but they told us it was full. They wouldn't allow us to leave the airport having to stay 12 hours there. At 6 pm without any comunication from the Company, asking around we figured out that half of the people in our morning flight left in the flight of 2 pm and that our 6:45 pm flight was delayed or cancelled again. Finally at 9 pm we flew to Dominica arriving at 10 pm. People had to book another hotel. Our taxi driver was not waiting us anymore because we were supposed to arrive at 10 am.Previous night without sleeping and we were stocked in the airport in Barbados 14 hours. They have no shame. The worst experience in my life.

### "rude, uninterested staff"
Barbados to Antigua with LIAT. All airlines can have technical issues but it takes Liats poorly trained, inefficient, rude, uninterested staff to make a travelling problem into a nightmare. We have a 10 hour delay and cancelled flight with no information given and staff that neither care to be at work nor help there customers to contend with. I have flown with many airlines all around the world over 40 years of travelling and visited 130 countries and this is the first time I have ever written about the experience.

### "inefficient, uncaring"
Tortola to Barbados. Do not fly with LIAT if you have other connecting flights. A 3 hour delay in Tortola with not one apology or explanation which led to us missing our flight from Barbados to the UK. We thought a 4 hour gap in Barbados left us plenty of time but we reckoned without the super inefficient, uncaring LIAT. Lazy ground staff in Antigua failed to warn Barbados staff of the extremely tight turnaround thanks to the late flight and they in turn did not advise our connecting airline - which closed the desk without us. Left in the airport till midnight, transferred to poor quality hotel and basically abandoned. Just had to fork out again for flights that are now expensive and not direct. Very unhappy. Do not fly with them if you have alternatives. They need to learn to look after their customers.

### "perfectly okay experience with LIAT"
Antigua to Barbados. Just in the interests of balance (since nearly all the reviews here are highly critical, and probably with good foundation since we heard only negative things about this airline whilst in the Caribbean), I'd like to say that we had a perfectly okay experience with LIAT. Our first flight was unplanned - we got re-routed to Puerto Rico and bought a ticket on the spot to Antigua. This flight left 15 minutes early and arrived 15 minutes early - absolutely fine. Our flight Antigua to Barbados arrived 30 minutes late, and our return (BGI-ANU) was totally on time. All baggage collection and return was very smooth, though they were quite strict concerning weight of checked and unchecked bags. In-flight service is minimal (a soft drink, but then flights are mostly short hops) but staff were pleasant in the air and on the ground. So, we'd fly them again without problem.

### "clearly needs competition"
Flew from Barbados to St Martin via Antigua. Flight to Antigua no problems but transfer from Antigua to st Martin was a joke! Cancelled flight with no direction from staff at airport. Poor staff being given hassle, found out same flight cancelled yesterday as well and other reports continued cancellations. Shocking service and a disgrace. This airline clearly needs competition.

### "LIAT is very disorganised"
Bridgetown to Dominica. LIAT is the worst airline - never on time. Delayed for 2 to 3 hours everytime I fly with them. If you can avoid flying with them please do. Once after being delayed for 3 hours, in the middle of the flight they announced they wouldn't be landing in the first country due to technical difficuilties they are proceeding to the next country. Fair enough. 23 passangers including I, had to stay until the next morning for the next avilable flight. The rooms of the hotel in which we stayed were hot and uncomfortable with very poor service. LIAT is very disorganised.

### "disgusted with the service"
I have never experienced such poor service, disdain and discourtesy from any industry. I travelled to St. Vincent in June 2016, My return flight which was carded the 19th June 2016 was cancelled and I was only informed of that when I went to check in on that date. The discourteous and disrespectful staff member walked to the Lobby and simply said that the flight was cancelled and LIAT was not responsible for our accommodation and transportation. I managed to get a return flight the next morning. LIAT you have messed up my daughter's wedding plans as I cannot be there. After an hour and a half delay, my flight on the 11th November 2016, was cancelled at approximately 10.45 pm. I think because LIAT have the monopoly on this route, they are taking advantage of your passengers. They have no problems accepting my money, at least deliver a good service. My experience with the Trinidad staff has been very courtesy, but some of the St. Vincent staff, their attitude leaves much to be desired. I hope that when the new airport opens in St. Vincent, that the competition LIAT get is more than enough to give a good wake up call. I am disgusted with the service of LIAT.

### "airline is not reliable"
LIAT pretty much has a monopoly between the eastern Caribbean / West Indies so if you travel between islands via air, you're likely going to experience LIAT. I flew from Barbados to St Vincent and the flight left 2 hours early - really. Then flew from from St Vincent to Dominica - the flight left 2 hours late and sat on the tarmac without air conditioning for at least an hour - and everybody was drenched in sweat and miserable, and then my bags didn't make it - none of them. They were delivered to the hotel the next day by a LIAT contracted driver who wanted a tip for delivering the bags. I then flew from Dominica to St Kitts - and that was 2 hours late again. Bottom line is that this airline is not reliable, has a monopoly and knows it - I think I'd rather take a boat, but it's what is there - I don't like it, but it is what it is.

### "8hrs sitting at that airport"
My first encounter with LIAT was January 2014 when I was about to take up residency and work in the BVI. The employers asked that I purchase a one-way ticket for which they planned to reimburse but I was met with difficulty in doing so, even though I provided all the necessary proof of my reason for travelling. I was forced to buy a return ticket with promise that the airline would put up the balance as credit on my next flight (with a year to use it) however I had to pay $31. from this balance have this done. I didn't travel again until a year and a half later so I lost my money. My second encounter was July 2015 when I was returning from SVG, with my son. Our flight was supposed to be 3:15pm I never left the airport till 6:30pm but not before being switched to 3 different flights with 3 different sets of boarding passes, no proper explanation and some how they forgot to switch our luggage. It was not until I was waiting by the luggage wheel for how long until I realized I was luggage-less. I reported this filled the necessary paper work and they promise to contact me which they never did. It was up to me to make calls all of the time to follow up on my suitcases. After 3 days of hell and having to buy clothes for my son, I finally received a call to say my luggage had arrived in Tortola. My next experience was in November 2015 when I travelled to Barbados for a visa appointment with intent to return home the following day. On my way back I was left at St Kitts airport at 2:35pm to await a connecting flight. I remained at that airport until 9:45pm with steady announcements that the flight was delayed until finally an announcement asked that the passengers return to the check in desk downstairs. I was then told that my flight out would be after 6pm the next day and that transportation would take me to and from a hotel. Arriving at the hotel where there was no pre-arrangements for accommodations and had to wait hours for this to be verified. Thanks to LIAT for the $30 voucher for meal. So I was scheduled to work the next afternoon shift and so had to be calling my supervisor to get a shift exchange with a coworker so I wouldn't go down as absent. My next encounter was August 2015 when my son was returning home. His flight was cancelled due to weather condition, a fair reason. Next morning I show up at the airport and was told my son couldn't check in because they have to deal with the other passengers whose flights were not affected by the cancellations the day before and that my son could not get a flight out until the next 5 days. This I think was ridiculous and I actually had to quarrel to get some information or I would have sat there all day without getting any. In February this year I travelled to SVG again, on my return date I got to the airport from which I live many miles away only to be told my flight would be late and I would miss my connecting flight from Barbados and that I would have to return home and travel the next day. Hello, what's the use of providing contact info when no one bothers to use them to update you about changes? My most recent encounter was last month when my 13 yr old son was returning to SVG. Got to the airport at 11:00am to check in for a 12:45pm flight, and spent 8hrs sitting at that airport before 1 single LIAT plane landed at that airport. Fortunately my son got home after 1am next morning without any overnights and I was grateful. Travelling again next 3wks, better service please.

### "luggage was removed from the flight"
The flight from St. Vincent to Trinidad was delayed and our luggage was removed from the flight with no information given. We arrived almost three hours later and our luggage was never placed back on the flight. When we inquired about our luggage there was no reason or response given. We explained that we were traveling the next morning and they were of no help. The luggage did not arrive on time the next day and we had to purchase other items as we were traveling with small children. I hope to never have to use their services again.

### "treat the public with disdain"
Originally flew into Barbados 22.8.16 to pick up LIAT flight to St Vincent that same evening, got through security to be told flight cancelled and we could either travel without luggage or stay overnight in Barbados, we chose the latter and flew out the next day. After a brilliant wedding and holiday we returned to E T Joshua 5.9.16 for a 15:40 flight to Barbados to meet connection at 19:25. Flight delayed and connection missed. No apology from LIAT and other members of my party still in Barbados waiting on standby. No apologies no explanations. Poor very poor. Until Argyle international completed and running we will not return to the beautiful islands of St Vincent and the Grenadines. One highlight was a friendly and helpful member of staff who wheeled my step mother through the airport and tried to go find a manager buy with no success. LIAT are causing much tourism to be lost. Once again very poor that one airline has the monopoly and feel they can treat the public with disdain and putting strain on crew and front desk staff who take the brunt of our complaints and seem to have learnt to shrug them off with the standard 'you just have to wait'. St Vincent and the other affected islands need to do something. Enough is enough.

### "LIAT is awful"
San Juan to St Kitts. LIAT is awful. My husband and I checked in for a 6am flight, they sent our bags down the chute and then said come back in 7 hours - flight delayed! We came back, board showed no more changes, got through nightmare TSA line and then delayed 7 more hours! I had our bags pulled, cancelled our reservations as our vacation was disappearing - LIAT did not acknowledge their problem for another 24 hours! They promised to refund our ticket price. Every email says the refund is coming - no refund. Value for the money=zero.

### "utterly disgraceful"
Barbados to St Vincent with LIAT. What can I say that many people havent already said? I do a lot of travelling for work and LIAT is the worst airline I have ever flown with. LIAT is rotten to the core and this filters down to the staff. This is what happens when there is no competition from other airlines. Owners don't care and neither doe the staff. What LIAT doesn't realise is that St Vincent (like many other Caribbean islands) rely on tourism and the experience tourist receive from LIAT will determine whether they return. Shame on you LIAT, shame on the owners, shame on the government for not having any competition and shame on the staff, utterly disgraceful.

### "4 flights, only 1 on time"
Beef Island to San Juan via Antigua. My husband and I flew LIAT for the first and last time. We had 4 flights over 2 weeks and only 1 was on time. Unfortunately, the on time flight connected to a flight that was 4 hours late which meant we spent 6 rather than 2 hours in Antigua during which time we only had announcements that the flight was delayed and a further notice would be forthcoming in 45 minutes. There were no LIAT personnel in the gate area who could give any information. I was very grateful that we were not connecting to another flight in San Juan until the next day. Our other 2 flights were 2.5 and 1.5 hours late and again I was very grateful that we were not under any time constraints. Our first taxi driver told us that LIAT stands for Leave Island Any Time and they lived up to their reputation.

### "deliver the worst service"
Barbados to Guyana with LIAT. What a disaster - they take your money and deliver the worst service ever. Boarded our flight in Barbados to Guyana and they took our hand luggage away at the bottom of the stairs as we boarded the plane. We arrived in Guyana 4 hours later to find our hand luggage and suitcase has been left behind, you don’t know where nor do the staff in Guyana. You then have to join a queue with all the other passengers from the same flight in the same predicament. What terrible service. There is a number to call but there is no one answering the phone, the staff must be inundated as we find out on our return to the airport for the next 4 days nearly every passenger who arrived in the month on May had the same problem - missing hand luggage and suitcases. My luggage arrived 3 days later and my hand luggage arrived 6 days later. I had left my contact details with LIAT for any updates - I somehow did not expect any service.

### "no trust and confidence in LIAT "
I was part of a group of 3 people travelling to St Lucia from London. Upon arrival at SLU, we immediately checked in our luggage for our flight to Barbados. We arrived at the airport at 18:30 for the flight that was supposed to depart at 19:35. We went through the security gate and started waiting for our flight. By 19:35 there was still no plane in sight. After waiting for an extra hour, finally a member of staff announced that the flight was delayed. So we were given a new departure time and asked to leave the gate. After a couple of hours, we went back to the gate, but the plane was still missing. We kept waiting quietly without having any information or help from the staff. Finally after a wait of over 5 hours, the plane arrived and we boarded. 15 minutes after we boarded the plane, the pilot announced that the flight to Barbados was cancelled and he asked us to disembark. We got off the plane and started queuing at the check-in desk for the re-issue of our booking and to be sent to a hotel for that night's accommodation. It will be helpful to let you know that by this point it was past midnight. As there was no room for the 7am flight, we were given 10:55 flight the next day. The situation had already messed up our arrangements in Barbados as we were planning to meet the rental agency for car pick-up and the landlady for our house. I had to contact them multiple times throughout the night to keep them up-to-date on our situation. After the long and tedious work at the LIAT counters, the cars came to pick us up to drive us to the hotel. We were given a hotel at Rodney Bay. I think the location and the dire state of the hotel we were given is the subject of another discussion, so I will let this pass. By the time we were in our rooms (around 2am I believe), we were exhausted, angry, disappointed and totally frustrated. We had already lost a day from our Barbados holiday which was in return wasted on airport seats. Nevertheless, without losing hope, we left our hotel at 930 the next morning and arrived at the airport to catch the 10:55 flight. Upon arrival, as we were checking in our luggage, we were told that the flight had delayed for at least 2 hours, which would push our arrival to past 2pm. At that point, we made the disheartening decision to cancel our flight (and our Barbados holiday) all together. We had no trust and confidence left in LIAT as it was impossible to believe the LIAT staff about the true time of the flight or if it would ever in fact depart. For these reasons, we decided to cancel our flight and find a place to stay in St Lucia instead. Thanks to this experience, we had a horrible start to our holiday. We wasted hours at a tiny airport, stayed at a low-budget hotel, and had to arrange last minute transport and accommodation due to the changes in our plans.

### "crew not friendly"
Barbados to Grenada with LIAT. Our outward evening flight was delayed by 50 mins but was uneventful and our luggage arrived with us. The crew were not friendly. Our return flight to Barbados departed 5 minutes early and we were served soft drinks. Our luggage arrived with us. Again the crew were not friendly. Having read through many reviews from LIAT I think we had a lucky experience all round.

### "uneventful flights"
I had two straightforward, uneventful flights with LIAT on 11th April 2016. The ANU to BGI flight was about fifteen minutes late and the BGI to DOM flight was about half an hour late. Check-in at V C Bird was quick and efficient, while luggage was delivered promptly at Grantley Adams. Then, check-in at Grantley Adams was also quick and efficient, while luggage was delivered very quickly at Melville Hall. From getting off the plane at Melville Hall to leaving the airport took no more than twenty minutes. Staff on the ground at all three airports were highly professional and very polite, and the same can be said of the cabin crew on both flights. If LIAT could replicate these standards on all their flights, then there would be little to complain about.

### "get effective competition"
The flight from Douglas–Charles Airport to VC Bird International Airport was smooth and uneventful, but the five hours that I spent at Melville Hall, before the flight, were filled with ever increasing anxiety and frustration. At check-in - which was otherwise very efficient - I was told that the flight was on schedule. Then we were told that the flight was half an hour late. Then we were told that the flight was two hours late. Then 2.5hrs and then 2.75 hrs. We finally took off at 6.55pm instead of 3.55pm. Apparently the plane had to make a couple of detours earlier in the afternoon! The staff on the ground did everything that they could to keep us informed of the situation and cabin crew were also polite and professional. Needless to say, my luggage didn't make it on to my connecting flight to London, but it was delivered to my house about a day and a half late. LIAT really have got to get to grips with these problems, but I can't see them doing so until they get some effective competition, or (better still) until Dominica builds a "full sized" international airport which can accommodate larger planes.

### "question this poor service"
I booked my LIAT flight on the 2nd February 2016. I was forced to arrange different days for my husband, son, sister and myself to return to Barbados to pick up our connection to return home to London as there were no seats available for our request. My husband and son were due to leave Guyana at 8am this has now been moved to 6am my sister and myself were due to leave Guyana at 11.pm Thursday evening - this has now been moved to 14.45 in the afternoon. Bearing in mind out flight to London is the following day. We will have to make other arrangements at our expense. Then another e-mail arrived changing our times yet again - I'm now on the phone to Liat trying to question this poor service.

### "little or no communication"
On 02/04/2016 I travelled from London Gatwick to Grenada via Barbados with LIAT. I was due to arrive in Grenada at about 9.20 pm on the same day. To make a long story short, LIAT delayed and eventually cancelled the Barbado to Grenada leg of the journey with no explanation whatsoever to any of its customers. We were placed in a hotel and left all day Sunday 03/04/2016. All efforts to find out when we would leave for Grenada were met with "we don't know" - even in Grenada my husband was told "we don't know". There was little or no communication - no agent consulted with us. It took 8 hours to get from London to Barbados and 48 hours to get from Barbados to Grenada and LIAT did not even say why the aircraft was delayed/cancelled. Shame on you LIAT, never again.

### "avoid flying on this airline"
LIAT cancelled all its flights to Barbados on March 24th because of a 6-hour walkout of air traffic controllers. Though the strike ended at 1:00 pm and most other airlines simply put their flights on hold until the short industrial action ended, LIAT took the easy and economical way out by parking up all their Barbados destined planes. The rationale for this is clear: since the flights were all paid for in advance, there was no business downside. On the upside, cancelling the flights to Barbados meant that many international passengers who have no intention to flying on LIAT during the 12-month period cancelled flights can be rebooked would have to find alternate routes to Barbados or elsewhere, most of which consist of very expensive semi-charter flights using SVGAir or Mystique Airways. Since LIAT never offers refunds, even if the choice to fly or not is made on spurious grounds, this means that they get to keep the monies already paid while being able to sell the "surplus" seat again. During high demand times between November and April, LIAT continues to accept excess and over-weight baggage at a large extra cost - unlike many international carriers - knowing that this will feed its bottom line even if it results in non-excess baggage left behind at the main international hubs in Antigua and Barbados. If you possibly can, avoid flying on this airline.

### "no one explained the delay"
LIAT flight was scheduled to leave St. Thomas at 1430 and arrive in Saint Martin at 1515, but the plane was still on the ground two airports behind schedule. TSA would not allow us into the waiting area so we found another lounge. We finally left St. Thomas at 1800, 3.5 hours late, and no one explained the reason for the delay. The crew normally ends work at 1800 but had 3 more landings to make.

### "should be closed down"
St Martin to Antigua. This airline should be closed down until it can offer something resembling the service it promises. Our flight from St Martin due to leave at 1350 and shown as on time. 1350 came and went and the flight disappeared from the boards, it suddenly appeared an hour later and left at 1520. This experience is good compared to many, but it shows me that this airline can't be trusted.

### "delayed even further"
Barbados to Ogle (Georgetown) with LIAT. We were delayed until from 5.40 to 8.10 and there was no explanation, then we boarded the aircraft and sit for 1 hr. After the aircraft was in the air we were told the bags were offloaded and that we were going to St Lucia to make a stop - then I was told in st Lucia that we were delayed even further!

### "may never see luggage again"
Warning - if you plan to take LIAT only bring a carry-on or you may never see your luggage again. I flew with LIAT from St. Vincent to Barbados where I had my layover to Toronto with WestJet on December 28th 2015. When I arrived in Barbados I was informally informed that my luggage had never made it onto the plane, but it was confirmed to me that it would be on the next LIAT plane to Barbados where it would be loaded onto WestJet. January 17th 2016, almost a month later, it is officially lost. LIAT apparently sent it to Barbados but had not written any paperwork to track it. I have my travel agent trying to track it done but I have heard nothing about it. No compensation from LIAT offered. I just want my stuff back. It's been an exhausting few weeks of trying to chase this airline that shows no apparent care for their responsibility. Would not recommend them.

### "be warned of this airline"
Our LIAT Barbados to Grenada flight on 3 January 2016 was to leave at 12.30 and arrive less than an hour later. First it was announced as 'on time'. Then we were told that there will be a delay and another announcement was to follow in 30 minutes. The waiting hall then changed. The new ground staff told me that the plane would come from St Vincent and had not even left Kingstown airport. Another announcement would be made in 45 minutes. Luckily I did not trust this information, it seemed to be made up. After 20 minutes boarding began. Nobody was able to tell passengers, whether their suitcases were on board, which is either a sign of ignorance or the lack of any reliable computer system (which is worrying these days). Half way to Grenada, stewardesses told us that the crew was tired; it had come to the limits of their statutory flight time, and therefore the flight had to be diverted to Port of Spain, Trinidad (and this was not know to the crew before departure?). Almost all passengers wanted to go to Grenada. Why not change the crew in Barbados or Port of Spain and use the same plane? It turned out that we had to find places on other flights, and there was no seat on any by LIAT. No arrangement existed with Caribbean Airlines, but we were placed on their flight after 9 pm. No LIAT agent took care of us. First everybody said something different, then it was left to a young lady - lowest in the hierarchy - to solve this, and she tried hard. It was not her fault. The flight took from 12.30 to 22.00, and all LIAT provided was a food voucher of $US8 - paying just for a succulent burger. Be warned of this airline. I would say: never again. but the problem is that there is often no alternative. LIAT gets funding from island governments and has no competition. Only the latter will bring changes.

### "waiting to be reunited with luggage"
There were three couples travelling between Sandals resorts in St Lucia and Antigua on the 07.50 Liat flight, this was a one hour hop between islands. On arriving at St Lucia airport, we found the check in queue was very very slow moving. Once we checked in it was announced at the flight was delayed by an hour this finally ended up 1.25 hours late. On reaching Antigua we were all waiting for our luggage and strangely each couple only received one piece of luggage and each of us had one piece missing, what are the odds on that happening, I say a million to one. The guy from the baggage handling company appeared at the luggage belt and informed us that there was no more luggage coming in and that the missing luggage had been left at St Lucia because there wasn't enough luggage space in the hold. We were all promised that our luggage would be on the next flight and at our hotel by 18.00 that day. This never happened and at this time we are still waiting to be reunited with our luggage. It seems that Liat are picking on the Tourist customer and systematically holding back one piece of luggage from each couple it is very strange that not one of the local customers had any luggage missing.

### "LIAT never again"
We scheduled a 4-day vacation on the island of St Kitts in January 2016 and boarded LIAT Airlines flight LI310 from St Lucia to Antigua early on 2 January 2016 to connect to a flight to St Kits (LI312) 3 hours later on the same day. After arriving in Antigua, LIAT announced that this onward flight had been delayed but further information would be provided. However, all reference to this flight soon disappeared from the display boards at the Antigua International Airport and the few LIAT agents that sporadically appeared in the public areas were unable or unwilling to provide any information, curtly brushing us off with unhelpful and cynical responses. Finally, late that afternoon LIAT finally announced cancellation of flight LI312 and transported us to the Royal Antiguan Resort, a decaying hotel near the city of St John. After waiting there for most of the following day without any information whatsoever we realized we were unlikely to reach St Kitts with enough time to enjoy our brief time there. We abandoned our vacation, cut our losses and requested a flight back to our starting point. Next day, Monday 4 January, LIAT flew us back to St Lucia. Sorry St Kitts, LIAT made sure you did not get our business! As for LIAT as a means of getting around the Caribbean - never again.

### "LIAT don't even try any more"
We need competition! LIAT don't even try any more. Last month I had a 26hr delay (they took us to hotel and woke us at 5am) and then that flight was also delayed. Now They just cancelled my St Maarten flight and 6 hours I have to wait to go through St Kitts  and get there after 8:30pm not 2pm. What I hate is that no one is to blame. Operational issues is all they say, and then the manger confessed "I don't know why they cancelled flight, no one tells me anything".

### "utter madness with this airline"
My family decided to take a mini vacation to the beautiful island of St Vincent for 4 days from 12th to 15th November 2015. The flight to get to St Vincent was without incident but when it was time to return home to Port of Spain our real troubles began. On the 15th November our flight was scheduled for 6:55 pm, we checked out our hotel at 12 noon, bummed around until 4pm then made it to the airport. On arrival to the SVG airport we were then told our flight was cancelled totally until the 16th at the same time 6:55pm. I had my 84 year old grandmother traveling with me as well and this was already too much for her. We were put up in another resort close to the airport for the night until 12 noon on the 16th. We again left for the airport at 2pm on the 16th. We arrived here to be told, we are on a flight to Barbados at 4:30pm which has a layover of 3 hrs and we will finally reach Trinidad at 10:25pm. I am now seated at the SVG airport - it is 4:30pm on the 16th Nov and we were just told the flight to Barbados is delayed for 1 hour. Home seems like a figment of my imagination at this point! This is utter madness with this airline. There is no flight board, no reps to give you any updated information and no recourse offered to hungry, tired and frustrated passengers! I will never fly with LIAT again and I will certainly never do this to put my 60yr old parents and my 84 yr old grandmother through this torture.

### "found out accidentally"
I made a reservation with LIAT for January 2016 to fly from San Juan to Dominica. This was a direct flight The reservation was made in June 2015. Without telling me the flight was changed to an overnight flight via Antigua. I had called to check flight times and found out accidentally. I was offered a flight the next day that had 4 stops and took 8 hours. When I tried to cancel all I was offered was a credit!

### "LIAT is a rip off"
I arrived in Port of Spain from Miami to get the LIAT flight to St Vincent. Got there, and no one from LIAT was to be found. By the time I got someone, I already missed the flight, they charged me more for a ticket for the same day than I originally paid. LIAT is a rip off for international clients, its a way of them making money. I wish St Vincent had another airlines that clients can use.

### LIAT customer review
Check in was orderly for the 0945 Sunday flight to Trinidad's Port of Spain with boarding commencing on time. We took off punctually and crew were polite and friendly handing out boarding cards. There was no drinks service on this flight. Landing on time and disembarkation prompt, we made it into the terminal building in time. A pleasant uneventful experience.

### LIAT customer review
My experience with this Airline in Puerto Rico was awful. I had a fly from Boston to San Kitts. When I got to San Juan, I found a note that said the the fly to Saint Kitts was cancelled due to the storm. I looked for LIAT staff and I was unable to find one. I tried calling all the numbers listed on the note. I showed up at the airport yesterday at 4:40 AM trying to get to the next available flight. When I got there they told me it was not guaranteed that I was going to fly to St. Kitts. I was left in San Juan for 3 days. There was a flight to leave after 7 hours they boarded everyone but me and my 10 year old daughter. They gave every passenger a voucher for breakfast but us, yelling at me saying that I did not qualify for the voucher. Staff told me that there was a flight to Antigua the next day but she could only accommodate one of us. My daughter is 10 years old. The next flight was on the first. Another passenger offer to give his sit and she refused. How do you recuperate from this?

### LIAT customer review
The journey did not get off to a good start - Port of Spain Airport is not the most organised airport in the world - long queues, staff who appear to hate their jobs, no air conditioning and generally bad attitudes. This was not helped by an LIAT Check In manager making us join 4 incorrect queues before we could check in making the process take over 90 minutes. That and a long queue for security meant we were not happy travellers especially having been told our bags might get there or then again they might not. Once through security it was a different picture, friendly polite gate staff kept us well informed about delays and boarding was measured and orderly. On board there was one polite cabin attendant and one who literally announced that she didn't want to be there. The 40 minute flight was enough time for us to complete landing cards and enjoy a complimentary Coke. The captain kept us informed on the journey, making up time and pointing out places of interest during the flight. The flight made up for a pretty horrible check in and we were delighted to be reunited with our bags without any issue

### LIAT customer review
Would like to compliment LIAT for its upgrade. As a frequent flyer within the Caribbean, LIAT's service has improved significantly. The friendliness and assistance of its ground staff as well as the courtesy and respect of the on board crew. From a previous period of late departures and subsequent late arrivals, LIAT is now offers more on time departures and arrivals.

### LIAT customer review
Always late is how it is referred to. 7 hrs to do a 30 min quick hop from Anguilla to Antigua as rescheduled to go via St Maarten. Plane leaving St Maarten was then late, and then having boarded sat on the runway for 1 hr whilst it waited for another late LIAT airline to arrive from another island!

### LIAT customer review
I represent a family of 4 traveling from Chicago to Dominica. I made the mistake of trying to save some money by booking with US Air to Puerto Rico and then Liat to Dominica. Due to the weather we were delayed getting in Puerto Rico and missed our LIAT flight. So far none of this is Liat’s issues. However, re-booking with Liat was a nightmare costing me over $600 to re-schedule. The flight was fine but working with customer service is maddening and expect your wallet to much lighter when they’re done with you.

### LIAT customer review
This airline has had a major improvement! I flew with them from Antigua to Port of Spain, Trinidad yesterday, making one stop in St. Lucia. The flight was on time, the staff were friendly and very attentive, the aircraft was a new, comfortable, quiet ATR-42-600. We were offered drinks on the sector from St. Lucia to Trinidad. What was
nice was that we stayed on board the plane in St. Lucia, rather than having to get off and reboard. My baggage came with me on time and I was more than happy with the service with LIAT. Also the price was great! $175EC one way!

### LIAT customer review
Flew from St. Lucia to Barbados and return at the end of April and beginning of May. Going there we took off on time landed early and bags arrived ok. Coming back we took off on time and landed early and were even offered soft drinks on the short 35 minute flight. The aircraft was a new ATR-72-600 both ways and the staff were very friendly and willing to assist with anything. I have seen a big improvement in this airline since the last time I few them and would recommend and return in the future.

### LIAT customer review
We recently flew from Antigua (ANU) to Grenada (GND) via St Lucia and Barbados (aircraft change). We had read a lot of negative reviews with regards to LIAT prior to our flights. Our flights were on time and in fact arrived in Grenada early. Our luggage arrived and we found all the staff polite and courteous. We returned to Antigua from Grenada via Barbados (aircraft change) and Dominica and again all our flights were on time and luggage arrived. Offered soft drinks on all flights. We would recommend using LIAT and we will use them again without hesitation. The only thing we would complain about was the price of flights however there is no real alternative.

### LIAT customer review
Flight 317 April 25 2015. Our flight from St. Croix to St.Martin was scheduled for 2.20. The flight left at 4.00. The ground staff did not provide any explanation as to the delay. Once on the plane it was discovered that the plane was going to Antiqua. We were not informed of this prior to boarding the plane nor was any explanation provided by the flight attendant. The flight attendant told us to check with the gate agent upon arrival at Antiqua. We were not met by any ground staff upon arrival and were left to our own devices. We finally were rebooked for a fight to St. Martin two hours later. Conclusion - lack of communication on the part of the ground staff and flight attendant. Lack of proper motivation to provide customer satisfaction. Lack of management action to address prior complaints.

### LIAT customer review
In the past two weeks I flew with LIAT on multiple occasions: Barbados - Grenada. Grenada - Trinidad. Trinidad - St Lucia. Dominica - Barbados. I must say all of our flights were on time. Luggage was there each time and overall we had a pleasant experience with LIAT. The standard of service is average for a cheap airline - flights are short haul so you shouldn't expect much. Safety instructions were given life jackets were there attendants would always answer your questions. What is required was for sure there. As an add-on compared to European cheap airlines - you even get your seat assigned!

### LIAT customer review
Our experience on a pre-booked flight from Barbados via Antigua to St Kitts was a travesty of inefficiencies lack of courtesy from ground staff and an exhausting experience. We were scheduled to fly out on Saturday at 17.30pm and eventually arrived 19 hours later in St Kitts after an enforced overnight stay in Antigua. The ground staff at Barbados had to be pressed to update us and seems disinterested in our well-being (a polite statement) when we arrived at Antigua no taxi transport was available we eventually got to a hotel some 45 minutes drive from the airport just before 23.00. LIAT told us to be ready to travel back to the airport at 8.00am our taxi arrived 30 minutes late and by the time we checked in the flight was full. we were then routed via St Maarten to get a connecting flight to St Kitts. We are frequent travellers but this experience left us physically exhausted and stressed. LIAT should be ashamed of the poor value and level of service.

### LIAT customer review
I have flown several times with LIAT over the last 5 years and had heard many "horror stories" of stranded passengers etc.. however my experience was ok up till now. Flying from St. Vincent to Tortola (still in the middle of it) I got the full brunt of Liat's gross incompetence. To make a long story short I was supposed to leave St. Vincent yesterday at 7.20am and arrived in Tortola same day at noon. We board the plane the engines start and then stop - we are told there is something wrong with the aircraft however don't worry we have an engineer working on it. We disembarked and stayed in the departure lounge until 7.30pm. Throughout the day the story kept changing - the misinformation (lies) were extraordinary "other broken airplanes engineer not coming we will get you out soon" etc. At 7.30pm they took us to a restaurant in Kingstown for dinner. We waited 2 hours for our food. After dropping us off they disappeared - returning at 11.30pm to take us to a hotel. No info on what would happen the next day but said they would be back at 6am to pick us up. The next day someone banged on my door at 4.30am - saying we have to leave in 30 min. We get to the airport at 5.15 - our flight was supposed to leave at 7.20 for Barbados (the first stop) we left an hour and a half late. At this moment I am in Barbados in the departure lounge - awaiting my next flight (to Antigua) at 1.50pm. Just heard that is has been delayed until 6.00pm. My flight from Antigua to Tortola leaves at 7.30pm (I will likely miss it and have to overnight in Antigua - The saga continues. I will likely end up spending three days and two nights in airports attempting to travel 300 miles from St. Vincent to Tortola. Take this airlines if you enjoy never ending frustration and mental torture. This is by far the worst travel experience in my 50 + years of flying.

### LIAT customer review
Currently seated in St. Kitts airport waiting on LIAT for the second day in a row. Flight was supposed to be at 11.30 it is 1.30. So far two announcements saying they will make more announcements later. Announcements with announcements about future announcements is all they can announce. This may be my second day trapped in St. Kitts airport but I will not give in and buy a one way ticket home on a different airline for twice what I paid for this one only because they will not refund my ticket. Do not use this airline if you are on a tight itinerary. You need hours possibly days between flights in order to meet your connections on time. Certainly do not vacation while flying liat because their idea of your vacation is in the airport.

### LIAT customer review
Booked BGI to FDR in July 2014 LIAT changed the time but did not notify passengers. We made the flight only by arriving early anyway with minutes to spare. Second flight FDR to SLU 1000Hrs. Yup 0930 change no notification but we checked. Arrived FDR only 11 people in-front of us 45 Minutes to the desk. Checked in boarding cards in hand. Flight Delayed. It appears that either the A/C arrived and experienced mechanical failure or was sitting overnight and failed pre-flight. Absolutely zero information except to hang-on and wait. Nothing else. They did provide lunch tickets for the Bagel Shop. Special Note to the lady running the LIAT customer service Martinique Thank you. So the new ATR-42 sits busted on the pad. They fly in the Old-Reliable Bombardier-8 and we leave at 1430. Arrive SLU and AVIS has given our reserved car away. One last LIAT flight SLU to BGI in 2 weeks.

### LIAT customer review
We booked SFO-FLL-SJU-DOM the last leg being on LIAT. A few days after booking we received an email stating that our SJU-DOM flight had been canceled and we would be rerouted through ANU at no additional charge. Inconvenient but we sucked it up. After all it would only be one more hour. Arrival in SJU was stressful. We had to find a LIAT employee to check in and get boarding passes. The transfer service desk was unstaffed and personnel from other airlines told us that they had no idea when a LIAT representative would show. Exited the secure area and checked in at the painfully slow and incompetently staffed check-in counter. The other half waited at the customer service desk inside the airport and checked in when a LIAT representative finally decided to show her face. At the check-in counter I checked in without issue though the computer crashed multiple times. Our 14.50 flight ended up leaving the ground around 16:40. Needless to say we missed our one-hour connection in Antigua. We were livid. Our plane was the largest in LIAT's fleet - an ATR-72. Nice enough clean and comfortable. No beverage or food service but at this point that was not unexpected. Landing in ANU we were informed that although we had missed our ANU-DOM flight the airline "graciously" scheduled another flight to take us to DOM. There was a single LIAT employee or so it seemed in the entire terminal – we initially encountered her at the desk that dealt with passengers in transit. There was a line at this desk that reached out the door of the terminal and onto the tarmac as people needed to get boarding passes for this new flight. The new ANU-DOM flight was scheduled for 18:30 but we were not surprised when we took off at 19:00. The plane was on an old Bombardier. Don't even think about bringing a rollaway bag with you as a carry-on. The overhead bins are hardly fit for a handbag. The seats themselves did not recline though were comfortable enough. Again no food or beverages.

### LIAT customer review
9/23/14 from St Thomas to St Lucia via Anguilla and St Kitts and Antigua. This is the worse airline I have ever been on. From the bug spray to completely unhappy personnel to them holding us hostage in the Antigua airport for 5 hours not letting us leave. Its like they make up there own rules and you have no choice but abide. My entire day in Caribbean was wasted and ruined because of this. I will never use this airline again!

### LIAT customer review
A group of us were planning a trip to SVD and BGI first to SVD then back to BGI. We arrived in Barbados from Canada at 2.30pm July 18th 2014 our connection to St Vincent was to be at 7pm. Arrived at the gate around 5.30 only to notice that it was so full of people we would have to stand or sit on the floor. At 9.30pm we were called to the desk at the gate to be advised that our flight had been cancelled. Shuffled from one part of the airport to another no instructions given no vouchers for food we were then met by disgruntled LIAT staff on the outside of the airport who seemed to be aimlessly writing down our passport numbers but giving us no indication as to what we were supposed to do next. Eventually told to get on a bus and go to the hotel. The next morning no LIAT personnel could answer our questions or tell us what was going on. At 2pm we were on our way they went from not being able to find any planes anywhere to all of a sudden finding one to get us out of there! The way back from St Vincent to Barbados had a 2 hour delay. LIAT is by far more detrimental to the Caribbean's economy than any Hurricane or natural disaster to hit the region.

### LIAT customer review
My review echoes that of everyone here. Arrived at 3.40am for a 5.30am flight from Trinidad to Grenada. Line was out the door to check in. Apparently the computers broke down which had been occurring all week according to staff. The staff seemed frustrated with their own system indicative that this is common. Check in and ticketing are two different lines which makes no sense. Finally get to my gate. Flight delayed 1 hour. I get it we're in the Caribbean it rains has unpredictable weather but an explanation would be nice. I finally arrive in Grenada but my luggage doesn't. I received no communication about my luggage. When I called no one picked up the phone (maybe a problem with the airport and not LIAT itself) and when I called corporate I got a busy signal. Finally had to go to the airport a couple days later hoping that my luggage had come in. I want to point out that I am not a complainer I generally only write good reviews but this airline. Well you'll find out because it's basically the only Caribbean airline. My advice arrive super early (3 hours or more) to make sure your luggage is the first to arrive.

### LIAT customer review
LIAT is the most unreliable airline I have travelled on. My family and I booked our flights from St. Croix to St. Lucia. Firstly my parents' who had booked their flights over a month in advance of their trip were only advised via email that their flight had been changed to the date prior to the expected departure. There was no courtesy call to my parents explaining the purpose of the change or to apologize for the delay. In any event I took a chance and booked my trip to St. Lucia to attend a family member's funeral. Fortunately I made it to St. Lucia just a few minutes late but not without hassle. I arrived at the airport in Puerto Rico at about 9.30 am. There were several persons waiting to check in. They told me that their flight had been cancelled the previous day and that they were asked to come in today to travel on the same flight that I was travelling. We waited and waited at the desk. It was not until over two hours later that an agent came to the desk and checked us in. The flight was about ten minutes late and we proceeded to our destination. Today is my return flight. I've been at the airport from 7 am waiting on my 8.05 am flight to arrive. It is now 12.30 pm. We were only advised that the flight was delayed upon arrival. Upon asking about the status of the flight I was first informed that it would arrive at 10.30 am then 11.45 am then 12.15 pm and now 1.30 pm. I'm supposed to catch a connecting flight in Antigua but although not on my itinerary the LIAT rep has advised that the flight will be going to my destination and I will not need to disembark until then. Let's see how that turns out! We were provided with breakfast. It is now 5 hours from check in and LIAT's supervisor has advised that we won't be provided with lunch. It's only upon request that we're provided with information regarding the status of the flight or compensation for the delay. I have to reiterate that this is the worst airline ever. They really need some competition. They take advantage of their customers and so little to no courtesy to them. This may very well be the last time I travel on LIAT.

### LIAT customer review
My girlfriend and I flew LIAT from into St. Maarten w/ connecting flight to Dominica on 7 July 2014. No problems everything was on time and the flight was comfortable. Returning was a different matter. We were grounded in Antigua because of a problem with the air conditioning system laid over two hours and received no updates or information while waiting. After an hour I demanded some update from someone only to find that they had already sent many passengers on to San Juan the announcement was in French. If I hadn't been proactive my girlfriend and I might have missed the second plane. After we arrived the 15 remaining received an apology and nothing else. By that time most had lost their connecting flights to the US and were forced to stay the night at our own expense. I will avoid this airline in the future if I can.

### LIAT customer review
Having read LIAT's reviews I was dreading flying with them. However our experience was excellent. We flew in a new plane from St Lucia to Dominica. I booked 6 months in advance there were no schedule changes. The flight was on time. The customer service was friendly and helpful. The price was good. I couldn't fault the service. Hopefully the company's new planes will help it to continue to improve.

### LIAT customer review
I was apprehensive before my recent flights with LIAT after reading these reviews. However I have to say that both flights were reasonably on time and quite pleasant. My bag did not make it today from St. Vincent to Barbados but it has just been delivered to my hotel so no worries. The tickets are expensive for the distance you fly but there is no other option. The Caribbean needs another airline to provide some competition.

### LIAT customer review
Just flew from San Juan to Antigua with tickets booked months ago only to find the first of year our non stop flight had become a puddle jumper stopping in Guadalupe and Dominque before reaching Antigua so we missed one whole day on the front end of our trip to an all inclusive. At the ticket counter I questioned this change and the agent said "we contacted you" which they did not. I had to go back and ask about our outbound flight. (she didn't mention that flight had changed also). So rather than leave at 10 am the following Sunday we had to leave at 4am arriving Dominque at 7.30am. The plane broke down in Barbados so we didn't fly out until 1.30pm causing us to miss our connection in San Juan. They offered no assistance whatsoever. No hotel voucher no food no rebook for next day flight. Nothing. They told me to go to the JetBlue desk and maybe they could help me. We wound up staying the night on both ends of flight in San Juan thanks to LIAT.

### LIAT customer review
The worst airline I have flown. Complete chaos in the boarding area when we arrived. No announcements and extremely rude staff. I was asked to gate check my carry on bag and reassured that it would stay on the plane to make it to my final destination - it didn't . There were no follow up calls the baggage service email generated an auto return because of a "full mail box". Generally the most miserable experience imaginable. Fly any other airline!

### LIAT customer review
Horrible customer service. Price per ticket BGI-POS through SVD (1 stop) quoted in Barbados dollars yet charged in USD. Rushed boarding unfriendly lazy flight attendant who yelled at passengers no inflight service whatsoever. Dirty seats loud airplane (Dash-8) and hardly any announcements from the pilots. Very crude rude rushed and absolute most horrible service I've ever experienced.

### LIAT customer review
We travelled to the British Virgin Islands from 20th - 29th April 2014. We flew LIAT from Antigua (ANU) to Tortola (EIS) and on our inbound flight from EIS to Barbados (BGI) for our flight back to London. The only positive thing is that we didn't lose our luggage. Now for the downside: Upon booking our tickets we had no idea (and only discovered once onboard the LIAT aircraft) that they were stopping at numerous islands before arriving at our destination meaning a flight that would take 20 mins would end up taking 1.5 hrs. After an 8hr flight from London we landed at ANU and discovered we were going through St Maarten before Tortola. We took off 30mins late for no apparent reason. In St Maarten the wait was supposed to be 15 mins…we waited 1hr. There was no air conditioning during that hour. The way back was much worse. What would have been a 2hr flight took 5hrs. It took us 5hrs to fly from Tortola to Barbados because we did Tortola-St Maarten. St Maarten-St Kitts. St-Kitts-Antigua. Antigua-Barbados. The flight from ANU-BGI is 1.5 hrs and we asked for food on board - no food. On that same flight the toilets didn't work. The staff weren't kind and warm. Next time we'll be flying via a private company much less expensive more reliable and quicker.

### LIAT customer review
Horrible customer service. Flight delayed from Dominica to San Juan yet no announcement made. No agents anywhere in site. Finally had to ask security to have an agent come to speak with us. Instead of a person the loudspeaker then came on with announcement only telling of delay. No specifics at all. Called LIAT in Antigua only to be told had to speak to my agent here. Since he was still invisible given local number which was not available without calling corporate. Just praying to get out today without having to spend an extra night trying to get to Atlanta.

### LIAT customer review
Looks like most of LIAT reviews are only done when there is a problem. We flew Barbados to St Vincent return and both flights were good. Out was on time and bags OK with full plane. Back was early - landed immigration and bags 15 minutes before scheduled landing time!

### LIAT customer review
I have been travelling to Dominica for nearly 40 years and for nearly all of that time the only internal carrier have been LIAT. Hence they have had a monopoly for nearly all of that time. As a result they simply do not care about their passengers and treat them appallingly. For the last few years our luggage has always been left behind in Antigua and on this latest occasion it took 2 days to get it back. I had to hire a car to pick up our luggage. On our journey back from Dominica to Antigua my wife and I checked in early in fact we were the second people to check in. Despite this we had seats 5D and 15A! They had for some inconceivable reason deliberately split us up! We were not the only ones. Nearly all couples had been split up. When I mentioned this to the stewardess all she said was: "Stop stressing stop stressing! There was no apology or explanation. Not only was the seating allocation totally incompetent it could also be construed as attempting to deliberately upset the passengers.

### LIAT customer review
Left EIS Sunday 22 Dec 6.30 pm due to arrive SVG 10.30 pm. Delays in both St. Martin and Dominica. No explanation or updates. Finally reboarded (after going through security check every single time) at 10.30 due to arrive SVG at 11.30 or so. While in the air was told by the pilot that SVG was "closed" so had to go to Trinidad. Arrived 1.30 am. Had to pick up bags at baggage claim. Told to go to "Gate 19" by 3.00 for check-in. I assumed they meant 3.00pm but no 3.00 am. Of course no one at the gate and it was finally "manned" at 4.00 am. Gave us 5 USD food voucher at about 4.00 am. THAT makes sense! Finally LIAT staff arrived at 5.00 to issue boarding passes and told us to go to gate A. Went to gate A and found out that all flights told to go to gate A for a 6.00 am departure. Appalling customer service. On the way back home was just as nightmarish with a stop and layover in Antigua. No one around to tell us anything and after a 5 hour delay the plane appeared and we boarded.

Was charged $120 for extra luggage because carry on was too heavy and then saw others on the plane with carry ons that did not even fit in overhead and they were allowed to leave it in the leg room area! We were told as we were boarding that seat assignments didn't apply and that we were to sit in the first available seat and then the flight attendants started moving people around based on where they were flying to while we sat in a hot plane! They moved one couple two times. The attendants were very rude. They didn't bother giving us immigration forms so we had to fill them out in line. Would rather charter a flight.

### LIAT customer review
My wife and I were departing from our honeymoon in Antigua on Monday October 28th 2013 and were on flight 362 Just had a horrible experience with LIAT into and out of Antigua from San Juan in late November. 3 hours late loading in San Juan. Then we sat in the plane for over an hour while they attempted to file a flight plan. Return flight also delayed 3 hours causing us to miss connection in San Juan. In fact the first 5 flights to depart from Antigua on the last Sunday in November were delayed. There were feeble attempts to keep the pilots informed. When got to San Juan was informed that due to "an illegal connection time" LIAT was not responsible to do anything. Found out that LIAT requires a 3 hour connection time at San Juan. In other words if you are flying through San Juan you must allow for 3 or more hour for you connection to LIAT or they are not responsible. The inability of LIAT to manage their schedules or perform even reasonable levels of keeping customer informed makes me wonder what is happening with their aircraft maintenance. Frankly I would discourage anyone from flying LIAT.

My wife and I were departing from our honeymoon in Antigua on Monday October 28th 2013 and were on flight 362 from Antigua to Puerto Rico which was a direct flight to San Juan. The flight was delayed however once on the aircraft an announcement was made that we were stopping in St. Kitts on our way to San Juan but not five minutes later we were told that we were now going south to Dominica. We arrived in Dominica at which time a grand total of 8 passengers boarded the plane. We were then told that we had to wait for a fuel truck which was not ready when we arrived in Dominica. We ended up waiting on the tarmac for over an hour with no water no food and no air conditioning. Numerous passengers asked for information about when we would be taking off and when we would be landing in San Juan as every passenger on the plane had a connecting flight to catch. None of Liat's customer service agents would give us a straight answer. We finally left Dominica sometime after 1.30 pm over an hour after we should have landed in San Juan. Needless to say nearly every passenger (including my wife and I) on the flight missed their connection in San Juan due to Liat's lack of respect for their customers further travel arrangements. We did not get on our previously booked flight to New York City. Luckily JetBlue were able to get us on a later flight to New York City. However because we had to take a later flight to New York City we missed our connecting flight to Buffalo and our waiting car rental. We were then forced to spend the night at a hotel near JFK airport. I would also add that we had to spend time and effort re-arranging our car rental from Buffalo back into Canada. We were considerably disappointed by our experience with Liat airline especially considering we were returning from our honeymoon! We will not be flying Liat in the future.

### LIAT customer review
LIAT continues to be one of the most required yet useless inter island Carrier here in the Caribbean. Most likely can't leave St. Lucia today on my planned 5.35pm flight to Barbados as it's 2 hours+ delayed and given my destination is Grenada won't get the connection in Barbados. Talk about an incompetent inefficient useless yet required airline!

### LIAT customer review
My husband and I paid extra for a non-stop flight from Dominica to Puerto Rico on September 14 2013. The flight was scheduled to leave Dominica at 9.40 but the plane took off at 9.10 (30 minutes before schedule). Fortunately we were there and able to catch the plane. LIAT changed our non-stop flight and we stopped in Antigua where for the next 5 hours we received delay announcement after delay announcement. There were no LIAT employees to be found to answer our questions about the plan to get us to Puerto Rico. The delay caused us to miss a connecting flight from Puerto Rico to Atlanta. There were no more flights to Atlanta scheduled for that day so we had to fly out the next day. There were many other passengers on that flight that also missed connecting flights and suffered similar additional expenses.

### LIAT customer review
I paid extra to get a direct flight from Dominica to San Juan. My LIAT flight left Dominica stopped in Antigua to pick up additional passengers and was delayed causing me to miss my connecting flight from San Juan to Atlanta. That was the last flight out of San Juan and I was forced to overnight there. LIAT refused to give me a hotel voucher and accepted no responsibility for their actions neither did they apologize. I would not recommend them to anyone. I just wish that there were more flight options with different airlines flying to Dominica.

### LIAT customer review
Travelled from Grenada to Trinidad using LIAT with my 9 month old baby flight was originally for 1.30 pm. After 2 hours delay the supervisor came out and said all flights that day were cancelled. At 5.00 pm sent to a hotel and told we were booked on a flight at 8.15 am. The aircraft landed and was then closed up because there was a hydraulic problem told that mechanics were being brought in from Trinidad. The plane was fixed and our flight left at 5.00 pm. The staff were discourteous and showed little sympathy that I was travelling with an infant whose formula cereal and Pampers were in short supply.

### LIAT customer review
LIAT is awful never had a flight that was less than 2 hours delayed round-trip between Puerto Rico and St. Vincent. They caused me to miss my connecting Southwest flight from San Juan back to the US and would not contact Southwest to make arrangements for their own fault. I had to spend to stay the night in San Juan and buy another plane ticket. I had a 6am flight that was delayed 2 hours. Weather delays I get but the consistent 2-6 hour delays is definitely within their control on these perfect sky days I had.

### LIAT customer review
Flight from Barbados to Grenada repeatedly delayed for 10 hours and cancelled at 1.30am. Told we could not be guaranteed a seat on flight the next day. Put in a hotel overnight. No complimentary refreshments offered at any time. I eventually got on a (delayed) flight the following afternoon after arguing at the check-in desk. On arrival I discovered my luggage had not made it on to the flight due to the plane being overweight. My luggage eventually arrived 2 days later. Minimal communication from staff and customer service was non-existent. My return flight was also delayed and as a result I almost missed my connecting flight home. I will never use LIAT again.

### LIAT customer review
Absolutely awful airline. Took about 8 hours to get from St Lucia to St Vincent. Avoid at all costs.

### LIAT customer review
We were simply flying from Tortola to St. Martin. First the plane was hours late. Second we get there and just a few of us got off the plane. We sat at baggage claim. No bags came off the plane. The flight left with all of us still standing there with no luggage and no one at all in the baggage area or answering the phone. A very nice security guard let me out so I could go to their front desk. The people there were beyond rude and laughed because I couldn't get back into baggage claim (the security guard let me in). They refused to answer my questions or to even call anyone. About ten minutes after I went back the claim area everyone's bags arrived.

LI361 to Dominica on the new ATR plane. Airport staff in Antigua were very helpful cabin crew excellent and we got our bags. Recommend to friends and family.

### LIAT customer review
Connecting flight from San Juan to Antigua was supposed to leave at 3.20 but did not leave until 5.30. Okay fine it was my last leg and i didn't have a connecting flight thankfully but I can't say the same for the other passengers. We arrived in Antigua and waited for our luggage but were later informed that no one's luggage was put onto the plane and we all had to fill out reports. Its the day after my flight and an agent called and told me everyone's luggage was still in San Juan and we would be called whenever it arrived but gave no indication if it would be a day or a week or a year. Never ever again will I fly with this airline.

### LIAT customer review
Left St. Martin at 12 noon yesterday Sunday July 21 to catch a 2pm flight to Barbados via Antigua Dominica St. Lucia St. Vincent on LIAT. Flight delayed from St. Martin for 3 hours. Finally boarded and headed to Antigua. Another 3 hour delay. Finally on to Dominica. Halfway there the Captain announces that he is experiencing some navigational problems and we have to return to Antigua. Returned and passed through the whole nine yards of Security again and settled down in the departure lounge while the airplane was being repaired. After 3 hours we boarded again and set off once more for Dominica. Arrived and waited half hour in the plane. Then we began to taxi down the runway for take-off. Just before take-off the Captain announced that the same navigational problem had recurred and that we have to turn around. It was now about 2am. Finally announced that the problem couldn't be fixed and that we have to disembark and spend the night in Dominica. Finally got to bed around 5am.

### LIAT customer review
My daughter left St. Maarten for Trinidad on Friday 19 July on a LIAT flight around 2pm. She finally arrived in Trinidad at 12.30am! Right now 21 July the rest of my family and I are en-route to Trinidad from St. Maarten on a LIAT flight. Supposed to leave St. Maarten at 2.10pm. Finally left at 5.30pm. Now it's 17.17pm and we are stuck in Antigua! Never again.

### LIAT customer review
I arrived at SVG airport heading to Barbados at 2.30 for a 4.20 flight. Told the flight would be leaving at 4. This was confusing because my boarding pass clearly said 4.20. When I asked for clarification I was told the flight "would not leave before 4". Strange response. Anyway the flight did not actually leave until some time after 10pm and during out wait we were given no status or confusing status. Customer service training is highly recommended. Understandably the airline has a monopoly but the experience just is an embarrassment.

### LIAT customer review
This airline gets zero stars for on-time service. I have to fly LIAT to get around the Eastern Caribbean. They haven't been on-time yet. Yesterday my 20 minute flight from St Vincent to St Lucia was delayed 10 hours.

### LIAT customer review
Plane was 1 hour late (unexplained) on the outbound BGI-SVG sector but thankfully as flight was not totally full luggage did travel. No such luck on the return leg. It was all the passengers who were connecting on to UK flights whose luggage didn't arrive and they had been clearly labelled as connecting luggage in St Vincent. We saw our luggage next to the baggage hold and foolishly thought that would mean it would travel - but no don't be fooled! It will now apparently be sent on a day later as it will miss the UK flight - not so great when you have yet another sector at the other end. Not sure if we'll ever see it again!

### LIAT customer review
Evening flight 509 from Tortola to St Maarten. Plane was full but on time. Arriving in SXM 75 percent of the passengers picked up their luggage 25 didn't. There is no one at 8pm in SXM airport so we waited to get some information for our luggage. One hour later some LIAT agents appeared and told us that our luggage was still in Tortola. Fortunately we stayed one night in SXM so we told the agent to deliver us the bag to our hotel "no problem". Next day we waited the whole morning nothing happened. After several calls to LIAT and the airport we were told that our bag was in the airport and that we can pick it up there. We went to airport to get it but in took us more than 1 hour to get no LIAT agent had a clue what to do or where the luggage is. Very poor customer service.

### LIAT customer review
Poor experience on this airline. I'm writing this review from the gate where I'm attempting to fly from Barbados to St Vincent. Showed up to the airport 3 hours early. About 10 passengers were pulled aside during boarding and told we wouldn't be on the flight because due to 'unfortunate circumstances' the plane was full. They pulled me aside after my traveling companion had already boarded so we got separated. Then they re-routed his plane through Grenada. I was told they would put me on another flight about 3 hours later however that flight is now delayed without much info on why or how long it's delayed. There are about 75 people at this gate that thought they were making various flights and now are sitting around with some mix of sadness anger and bewilderment. I was given a $13 USD voucher for my trouble.

### LIAT customer review
We flew yesterday from St Lucia through Antigua to St Kitts. Our bags arrived with us on time in St Kitts. After reading several very negative comments we were pleasantly surprised. The check-in at St Lucia's small northern airport was good. LIAT staff were friendly. When we were seated onboard ready to take off a customer agent came on the plane and told the passenger across the aisle from me that his bags would not be on this plane but would be at his destination by the evening. On the flight to Antigua the captain was very chatty acting as a tour director for the islands we passed over which was nice. When we got to Antigua I asked the LIAT Transit area person if she could check on our bags and she said no. She said that since the person in St Lucia had not talked with us our bags were probably ok. So all in all it was an uneventful trip on LIAT.

### LIAT customer review
Our itinerary 2012 involved flying St Lucia - St Vincent via Barbados returning direct a week later. The flight arrived on time from Antigua and we boarded the plane for the next two sectors of it's island hopping progress. At Barbados we had to leave the plane and go to the transit lounge which wasn't a problem. Blissfully ignorant we rejoined our Dash-8 in different seats then sat and sat. It seems there was an overbooking problem which saw a lady leave her seat in the cabin and strap herself into the jumpseat in the cockpit. Her seat was then taken by a man paperwork eventually sorted and we were on our way to SVG - again no problem. On arrival at SVG we went to the carousel and waited and waited. Eventually the belt was turned off and there was clearly no more baggage although there was a growing stack of boxes in the corner of the room. Passengers suggested that LIAT had done their usual trick of leaving passengers baggage behind in favour of airfreight. We were told to go to the LIAT desk in the departures hall and make an official claim along with other pax who were missing their luggage. After probably half an hour we got to the front of the queue. And completed the "lost luggage" form. Fortunately the driver of the minibus taking us to our resort took us whilst a colleague agreed to go back to the airport and pick the luggage up from the next flight from Barbados. On the return we checked in and went through to the departure lounge. When the plane arrived the forward baggage was taken out by tractor and two trailers. They loaded the whole of one trailer and most of the other then stopped and brought around a dozen bags back off the plane onto the trailer. As we walked out to the plane my wife pointed to our bags on the trailer and asked if they were going on the plane. The LIAT employee confirmed that they would. After some time the crew eventually got the plane underway for the direct flight to Castries St Lucia. On arrival there it really wasn't any surprise that our bags didn't fly with us although there was no LIAT presence in the arrival hall at Castries to tell us that. Clearing immigration we proceeded to the LIAT check in desks and joined the queue. After more time wasting we eventually got to the LIAT girl who explained that LIAT had reduced the number of flights and they were always full. No surprises there when they choose to convey profitable airfreight instead of their passenger's baggage. The next part of our holiday was three nights in a resort adjacent to Hewenorra airport - 90 minutes taxi away. The taxi driver kindly offered to return to Castries and wait for the next flight from SVG. And our bags were delivered around midnight and we "had" to give our taxi driver 50USD. My advice to anyone considering LIAT as part of their travel arrangements : 1) Do Not expect your hold baggage to travel with you. 2) Do not plan a connecting flight for at least 24 hours after you step off a LIAT flight. 3) Do pack yourself a change of clothing toothbrush etc in your hand baggage. Of only 2 flights with LIAT they lost the baggage both times.

I seem to be a lucky traveler my flights on LIAT have been on time and I did not lose my luggage a friend on one leg did though but it came the next day. The crew are warm and helpful.

### LIAT customer review
Flew from Barbados to Grenada yesterday morning. Only 30 minutes delayed so no real problem there but I noticed that my suitcase was still sitting on the runway as we took off! The stewardess offered little advice or apology simply saying that 'the plane was too heavy so we've taken off some of the luggage'. Upon arrival at Grenada airport there was very little assistance for the dozen or so families whose bags were left at Barbados airport. LIAT reps were unhelpful and did not offer an apology. It took an hour to fill in the necessary paperwork and we were told that they did not know when our luggage would arrive in Granada. There are two flights a day but it is now the second night of my three night holiday and still no luggage or contact from the airline. Sadly it is unavoidable to use LIAT if you want to travel between Caribbean islands. I could only advise that you travel with hand luggage only so that you know it is actually on the plane with you.

### LIAT customer review
Was due to fly LIAT from Antigua to Grenada via Barbados on 1st August 2012. The first flight was delayed - 'operational reasons'. The second (Barbados to Grenada) was called we boarded - confirmed that the flight was going to Grenada and then onwards to Trinidad. When we were going into land the pilot announced that we were landing in Trinidad. We were basically dumped in Trinidad with no forward connection. Staff were reluctant to deal with us. Our baggage had been taken off in Barbados! We were put up in a very small low class hotel - awoken at 3.30 the next morning to get a connecting flight. When we arrived in Grenada still no luggage.

### LIAT customer review
Delayed from 8am to 6pm on Friday 3rd August in Barbados on the way to St Vincent due to tropical storm. Don't mind the waiting but do mind the total lack of information. No LIAT rep was interested or knew anything. SVG to Barbados on Sunday 5th - friends bag never arrived on flight (apparently this is quite common) so landed in London with no luggage. Bag eventually arrived two days later. Bring on the competition for this airline please as they are a monopoly: prices are high service is appalling and its 50/50 whether the flight will actually leave on time if at all and whether your luggage will arrive.

### LIAT customer review
For our return flight to Europe we had to take a flight from ANU to SDQ. This flight was booked and paid well in advance. After checking in in Antigua we learned every hour to expect 1 hour delay. There was no ground staff interested in supplying any information. With a 3 hours delay they decided to board. After 20 minutes the Pilot returned to the airport due to technical problems. Back in the departure hall we complained that we had lost our connection and we have now to investigate for other possibilities. There were again no willing representative to help us and we were stuck. After 3 further hours we received our luggage and were escorted back into Antigua. During this wasted time we lost 2 other possible flights. The flight itself was cancelled thereafter.

### LIAT customer review
Flew Antigua to St Maarten with a stop in St Kitts. Flight out was on time and return delayed just over 1 hour but kept well informed by ground staff in St Maarten. Ground staff and crew were very pleasant in both Antigua and St Maarten. Flight was expensive but they have a monopoly on most routes so they like most other airlines take advantage of that. The aircraft's were old but sufficient for the short hops they do. Overall a good experience and baggage arrived no problems.

### LIAT customer review
Recently flew from San Juan (Puerto Rico) to Antigua as a result of BA dropping its own flight frequency out of SJU to one flight per week. I was impressed by how much LIAT has improved. We were on time our luggage arrived with us and the flight was good value for money. The best bit was the quality of the staff both on the flight and at the airport - they were friendly knowledgeable and kept us updated on the flight. The only drawback is the age of their plane. You get what you pay for.

### LIAT customer review
Waiting in St. Maarten for almost 6 hours to get flight to St. Kitts. We couldn't land this morning because of weather. LIAT employees were rude uncaring and only interested in not being bothered. They have made no effort to update us until confronted with our complaints about the lack of concern by them. Hopefully will never have to fly them again.

### LIAT customer review
Antigua to Barbados but due to industrial action we were ultimately delayed over 48 hrs. Staff at Antigua Airport check-in could not have been less helpful - they started with a cheery nonchalance which was irritating. Eventually they gave up on even smiling and not once during our 2-day ordeal did we receive an apology. We were eventually sent back to our hotel (after a six hr wait at the airport with no information or refreshments) and told to come back the next day. Same thing happened the next day but all the time there is no clarity. We were simply herded around like cattle. On day 3 we did eventually take off but even then we were 2 hrs late for no apparent reason. The aircraft itself was tatty and unkempt and we weren't even offered a drink. I would do everything I could to avoid travelling with this airline again but sadly they have the monopoly of most or many Caribbean routes. A total shambles.

### LIAT customer review
Having read reviews I was rather worried about our flights from Antigua to Tortola and Tortola to Barbados. However flights were on time staff very pleasant and our luggage arrived with us.

### LIAT customer review
We arrived in the north of St. Lucia to be told that our plane had already left - apparently it was our fault that we didn't know we were supposed to have received an email regarding this but we did not. There were no apologies or pleasantries as we were re-booked on two alternative flights 4 hrs later taking a much longer route to arrive at St Vincents (originally a 30 mins flight). On the second flight from Barbados to St Vincents there was no water and no usable toilet. The stewardess was uninterested and kept yawning. When we arrived at St. Vincent later that evening all of our luggage had been mislaid between St. Lucia Barbados and St. Vincent. We reported the situation to a rather dispassionate lady at the LIAT desk and then continued to our destination. We phoned LIAT the next morning and the service person was abrupt. They had found 4 of our 5 bags and didn't seem to know whether to send them to us or not. They sent the 4 bags and when they located the 5th later that day they wanted to wait until the next day to send that - which would have been a problem since we were traveling.

### LIAT customer review
Having read previous reviews I was a little wary of our flight from Barbados to St Lucia - but it turned out to be a very pleasant problem free experience! Check in was efficient and we proceeded to the departure gate although we were slightly delayed due to 2 earlier flights out of Barbados being delayed which meant that our paperwork was at the bottom of the pile. However the crew kept us well informed of the situation and they managed to secure the one and only air conditioner to keep us cool while we waited on the tarmac! The flight was just over 30 mins long so not much happening once we were in the air but a smooth take off and landing and a very pleasant air hostess.

### LIAT customer review
BGI-ANU via SLU. At the gate in BGI was advised by the staff that we would have to use the toilets in the terminal as the one on the plane was not in use. Left BGI a few mins late and on arrival in SLU was advised to leave the plane no staff about to ask why and had to wait in immigration until someone turned up 15mins later to let us through to the transit lounge. About 1hr 15mins later were advised over the PA system that the plane was now fixed and boarding would commence in 10mins 20mins later a LI staff member turned up at the gate and started to board! Once on board the Flight deck advised us that our plane had been used for another flight and that we had to wait for this one to be serviceable. Flight was ok but cabin crew do not do anything apart from safety demo and insecticide spray then she sat down for the duration of the two flights.

### LIAT customer review
Antigua -Nevis -Tortola-St Maarten-Nevis-Antigua found this airline to be quite good. There were some slight delays here and there but the experience was satisfactory. Cabin crew were very good and Dash 8 aircraft were clean and tidy. With the exception of our Antigua departure the ground staff were friendly and helpful. All flights were short so our expectations of catering weren't high.

### LIAT customer review
SXM-EIS-SKB-ANU-DOM-BGI-SLU-SVD-POS - I left a bad comment some years ago about this airline but they seem to have improved. 90 per cent of my flights left on time the luggage with me in (they are famous for losing bags). Cabin crew friendly but service is nonexistent even on 1 hour flights. Some of the planes are very old and smelly tickets are pricey but if you buy them in the package it is cheaper - but be aware that you can not change.

### LIAT customer review
The fundamental problem is that LIAT has a monopoly of many routes. We paid about £300 each to fly 200 miles with LIAT having paid £500 each to fly 4000 miles from the UK to the Caribbean. How stupid is that! The best catering on the LIAT flight out was a warm can of coke for US$2 - how difficult would it be to take a chill box of drinks onto their silly little planes for the steward to sell instead of chatting to his girlfriend. Be warned - LIAT means "leaving in any time" - for reasons unknown we left 1/2 hour late sat on tarmac on a stopover for 30 minutes having been told it would be 15; after sitting then on the runway for another 15 minutes we finally set off. Allow a generous time allowance for connecting flights then some more as it also means "luggage in any terminal" - we heard many tales of lost luggage and friends had to anxiously wait for the following flight (also late!) for one of their cases. The locals seem to get round this problem by taking up to 4 bags on board each one bigger than stated limit. Don't think I'll risk trying this if there is a next time (yes the final destination is worth it) but I may take earplugs along.

### LIAT customer review
I flew Liat on 26th July and 6th August 2010 and will never fly with them again. On the outward journey they told me I could not travel on to my destination Canouan as I did not have a return ticket. I was not sure how long I was going to stay in Canouan but I did have a return ticket to fly back to London. They reduced me to tears before they eventually allowed me to board the flight. On the return journey they cancelled the flight and then told me that I am not entitled to a refund as they hold the money in a credit account for when I fly with them again! When I eventually got back to Barbados without any help from Liat the manager on duty dismissed me with a flick of her wrist even though I was standing at the counter and her staff were asking her to assist.

### LIAT customer review
Flew 4 sectors during a recent holiday (ANU-DOM-BGI-SLU ). All flights were on time and bags arrived OK. Flight attendants polite and helpful. Dash 8s had rather tired cabin interiors but the safety procedures seemed as for all other airlines. Flights were rather expensive for the distance travelled.

### LIAT customer review
BGI-CIW-BGI. All segments were late there was major attitude and the fare was unbelievably expensive. In fact this short island hopper flight cost almost as much as my international flight from the USA! Planes old and dirty. They have a monopoly and they clearly take advantage!

### LIAT customer review
The boarding was late and we get no information at all. 2 hours after boarding time they cancelled the flight. Officially because of maintenance reason but we are pretty sure they cancelled because only 6 people booked the plane.

### LIAT customer review
We flew three times on holiday. The first flight we were late owing to BA but they put us on a later flight. The second flight the check in staff had our son down as Canadian so we had to spend about 45 minutes at US immigration at San Juan. The flight itself was good and on time. The last flight was late and they did not take my wifes luggage but amazingly they delivered it early on the following day. Do not depend on them to take a connecting flight. I am afraid they more or less have a monopoly.

### LIAT customer review
My wife her sister and I had the pleasure of flying LIAT from Barbados to Guyana return. As we were on holiday delays and late luggage didn't really matter to us as we took it as an adventure. This time round we chose the direct route non-stop and it was on time and pleasant - they have improved from the last time we flew LIAT. For those on holiday 'hey you're on holiday everything is an adventure or an episode'.

### LIAT customer review
When you use this airline make sure you have a back up plan. If your LIAT flight is cancelled and you end up missing your connection flight to US or Europe travel insurance company don't refund money for ticket because LIAT frequently use the excuse of Monserrat volcano spewing ash which ends up being an "act of God" therefore cannot fly and insurance company do not refund money.

### LIAT customer review
Had a harrowing experience getting from Trinidad to Grenada! After two 5 hour flights I got to Trinidad at 6:30 am and tried to check in with LIAT airlines for a 2:15 flight. The said I couldn't check in until noon. That meant no way past security to where the comfy lounges are need a boarding pass for that. When I did check in at noon they said I have to check my rollaboard as well as my regular suitcase and could only take my laptop case aboard. Said my suitcase was 1/2 kilo overweight and charged me 75US for it. After I paid they said which of the two would I like guaranteed to arrive in Grenada? Something about weight balance of the plane. When I boarded you couldn't believe some of the cases people were stuffing in I guess that luggage regulation is only for american tourists. Finally the plane was 1 hour late and the port agent was not there to pick me up as promised. I got to the ship by taxi 15 minutes before it sailed but at least with all my luggage. Now here's the funny part the airline LIAT has a slogan which is "Always on time! So at least I got a good laugh about it.

### LIAT customer review
I have flown LIAT 5 times in the last week - San Juan to Barbados (via St Lucia) Barbados to Trinidad Trinidad to Martinique (via St. Lucia) Martinique to St. Lucia and St. Lucia to St. Martin (via Antigua). In general very disappointed with this airline. While the flight attendants have been professional and polite the same cannot be said of the ground staff which is a disaster. The first two flights were delayed but explanations for the delay were not forthcoming. At St Lucia airport the monitor showed my flight as being "on time" but in fact it was delayed. I arrived late from a connecting flight and seeing this message I thought I had better get on to the airplane. Doors were closed however and there was no LIAT representative anywhere in the waiting room. Finally I was able to find out from a police officer that the flight had not left yet and that the screen obviously was providing inaccurate information. Due to delays in the flight to Barbados I got to spend the evening without any dinner. Everything had shut by the time I got to my hotel. There was further lack of professionalism in other flights but they concern a topic that "cannot be published".
