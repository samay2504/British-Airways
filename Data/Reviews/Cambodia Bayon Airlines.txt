### "aircraft noisy and vibrates"
Short trip from Siem Reap to Phnom Penh on March 17. One way cost $50. The plane is a Chinese Built MA60 turboprop aircraft that currently does not have a certificate to fly in Europe, N America, etc. It's very noisy and vibrates (much more than an ATR). Weather was good so no problems, but not sure I would like to be on one in poor conditions. The week before I flew PHN-REP on Bassaka Air A320 for similar cost, which was much better.
