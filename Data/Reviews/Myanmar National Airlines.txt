### "Check in wasn't an issue"
Not Verified |  A short 55 minute flight to Loikaw. Check in wasn't an issue. Boarding  10 minutes earlier, and I was greeted by friendly flight attendants. After the plane took off the flight attendants started serving inflight meals Which we decided not to eat. Landing in Loikaw was smoother than the landing in Yangon.

### “flight attendants were the best”
Not Verified | A 1 hour flight from Loikaw to Yangon was incredibly pleasant. The ground staff were really nice and active. On the plane, the flight attendants were the best and some of the nicest people I've ever met. The seat were better than average for a small Turboprop. Inflight entertainment is not good, but the food are really good. I wish I can fly with them again.

### "I regret flying with them"
Not Verified |  The check in receptionist make me get a return ticket by force. I have traveled before but I only need to show a booking ticket. Now they just made me a confirmation ticket just to make more money. And their communication with the customer is awful. I regret flying with them.

### "Short but pleasant flight"
Short but pleasant flight, on time. Friendly crew, cheap tickets, clean plane, and for a such a short flight, a good snack was offered. Boarding and deboarding fast

### "a very pleasant experience"
Singapore to Thandwe via Yangon with Myanmar National Airlines. This was a very pleasant experience. All flights ahead of time, great service and food, super friendly flight attendants. Both, the domestic and international terminals in Yangon are modern and well organized. Overall, highly recommended!

### "I had an excellent flight"
Yangon to Heho with Myanmar National Airlines. Booked a flight with them for an hour flight for approx. 62 usd. Check-in had to be done via check-in counter for domestic flights, which was chaotic and slow as people did not really stay in line. Boarding was done by bus and should have happened at the exact same time as another flight to Loikaw, but our flight was already delayed by about 40 minutes. Boarding went quickly however and noticed that ground staff placed us at an emergency exit, lots of legroom. Flight itself was 40 minutes or so with a complimentary drink and snack service. Ordered coffee, received tea. My girlfriend ordered water, received sprite. Upon landing, walking to terminal where we received a passport control (domestic flight) and luggage was dropped in a room via windows. No belt available. Despite the delay, I had an excellent flight.

### "Quick, efficient, professional"
Loikaw to Yangon. Quick, efficient, professional, and smiling! It is enough to arrive at Loikaw airport 45 mins before departure, as the ground crew does a thorough check-in and control manually yet quickly. Plane slightly late landing, passengers and bags deplaned quickly, plane loaded and off we went in no time. During a flight of less than an hour we even got a small breakfast (2 sweet pastry) a hot and cold beverage, landed, deplaned and our bags arrived within minutes at the carousel. We even got a spectacular view of the mountains and winding rivers below in the morning sun. I do not remember when was the last time a flying experience was unhurried, non-stressful and enjoyable.

### "schedule changed without notice"
Yangon to Mandalay. Aircraft type changed from Boeing 737 to E jet Flight time changed. (My last flight) In September, flight schedule changed without notice and so I have to buy new ticket with new airline. It seems they don’t have enough aircraft but sell the ticket. So they arrange the schedule accordingly. So not convenient, not recommended for the passengers with important or fixed schedule or travel.

### "What a great airline"
The flight was about one hour and yet the flight attendants managed to hand out refresher towels, then they gave each passenger a snack box and on the the third service round, each passenger was given a drink. All this was done unhurried, with poise and a smile. Such an unexpected level of 5-star service. In addition, boarding was on-time, flight departed and arrived on time. What a great airline.

### "comfortable and enjoyable"
Heho to Yangon. The aircraft was pretty new and very clean. We have been greeted with a smile and the personnel was kind and professional. We have been served some basic breakfast, that for such a short flight was appreciated. Flight on time and overall very comfortable and enjoyable experience.

### "meal is great but simple"
Yangon to Mandalay. Lounge photo and In flight meal photo are added. We can access Lounge at Yangon International Airport for all Business Class traveler, variety of Breakfast. Lounge is located at the 3rd floor of Yangon International Airport Terminal 3 for domestic. In flight meal is great but simple because it is just a 1 hour short flight.

### "staff was friendly"
Singapore to Yangon. I didn't know what to expect when I booked this flight, but I don't regret. The airplane was clean, staff was friendly and food was good. Also a lot of space for the legs, good entertainment and opportunity to charge phone/tablet. In the Emirates/Garuda league in my opinion.

### "much better than I was expecting"
Very happy with my trip, I flew from Bangkok to Mandalay on Christmas day. Flight was on time. Staff were polite and the aircraft was clean. The service is much better than I was expecting (snacks, free luggage) given the price and how bad and expensive low cost European flights have become. I would definitely recommend flying Myanmar National Airlines.

### "a pleasant experience"
Flew the quick 45 minute flight from Thandwe (Ngapali Beach) to Yangon with Myanmar National Airlines. New ATR 72-600, and it was a pleasant experience. As soon as cruising altitude was reached the flight attendants moved quickly down the 2-2 cabin with pastries, then returned to serve tea/coffee, with lollies during descent. Expensive for a short flight, but an enjoyable experience. After two domestic flights in Myanmar with two carriers, would have no problems recommending.

### "enjoy it for a 2.5 hour flight"
I traveled Yangon to Singapore return in economy. They have an eight seats Business class session but it was not occupied on outbound. Up to row 8 is premium economy but the same kind of seat as economy. Boarding was swift on both flight. Cabin ambience was nice and greeted by crew in colourful dresses. Male crew wore blue suit. Seat was ok for me but will have problem for tall and slightly larger passenger. Both flights probably have only like 60% load factor. Safety video was very informative and done in Burmese which could surprise foreigners who had never been on a flight before. However, the English run was done after the Burmese so all is good. Meal service started after seat belt signs was off. SIN-RGN starts with a drink service and a coffee run after meal but RGN-SIN went straight into meal. UB001 was two choice noodles and friend rice. My neighbour chose noodles but the crew did not have it and said will return but never did. When tray was collected the same crew pretend it did not happen. The meal was small and not delicious. SIN-RGN has a choice of chicken and fish curry rice. I chose chicken and it was surprising good meal. The vegetables were surprisingly fresh and nicely cooked. Mood lighting is also part of this new aircraft so it was a comfortable cabin to be in. My travel was during the monsoon so the flight was a bit bumpy but not to the point where they have to stop the inflight service. They also provide duty free shopping but on both flight the MNA plane model was out of stock. They have power supply in seat and in flight entertainment through wifi service was good but limited materials. I still enjoy it for a 2.5 hour flight.
