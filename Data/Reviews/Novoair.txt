### "Worse airline ever"
Not Verified | Saidpur to Dhaka. Worse airline ever. Late of 4 hours resulted in me almost missing my international flight. While I ask the staff at the desk about the schedule, they were not helpful, somehow rude, never informed me on the late schedule.

### "Not a bad airline!"
Jashore to Dhaka. A not well-known domestic airline in Bangladesh. The flight was late but we did get to our destination in a straight flight with no circling around. Being a short flight the cabin service was basic but adequate. Not a bad airline!
